But you hodled strong and this time next year you won’t think on it. 
Hind sight 20/20. We could say the same with almost any other event. Part of being in BTC is learning to overcome and control your emotional feelings and recognising FOMO and fear. 
The tech is doing great. 0.16 is coming out soon and adoption is growing. 2nd level is moving fast and these are exciting times. The network is stronger than ever. 
You have a little bit of the internet of money in your wallet. Imagine if you could have done that in 1994 with the web.

Amazing to see these guys continue to work through the FUD and progress the technology. Credit to them. 
Additionally, I read Monero would implement soon as their transaction sizes are large (ring signatures etc) and cost circa the same as BTC during heavy load (but as I understand have flexible block size ?)

Nice take on the lightning network !
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:48:47
Mid 2013. I was reading technews on Flipboard. 
At the time I was looking for a way to buy shares and trying to find best sources of info etc. I just could not keep up with the ins and outs of the business world and gave up thinking I will be doomed to a savings account forever (at that time I had just managed to pay off all my debt and literally had nothing - it felt great !). 
It’s a vivid memory when I first bought btc. When I first read about it, I literally just got up off my chair and went to the PC and tried to buy it. I was like Data in TNG episode ‘Brothers’, but I was driving deep down into the rabbit hole. The only method that worked quickly for me was using MultiBit and buying from bitbargain. It was a small amount but I had never felt liked I had truly ‘owned’ anything until I saw the btc in my wallet. I cannot really explain it. Perhaps because of all those years in debt. 
I then bought every payday since then. Even now. Admittedly I sometimes over-stretched myself (nothing serious) to get to a ‘round number’. I loved the whole process. This was the whole 2014/15 bear market. But, I loved collecting it. It felt completely different to saving. I think this was because my money had come and gone so easily. 
Through that time I was lucky enough to participate in the ETH presale (2000 ETH per Btc, I remember baulking when it went lower to 1337 towards the end!) but sold early on (into BTC - not a move I regret but could have held as it didn’t impact me. The DAO issue got me unfortunately). I also tried ETH mining but I had my coins in MultiBit and didn’t want to leave the PC. I was also one of the many that mined to the default address 0x0000... so lost it. 
Since then using various guises I have read this sub every single day, sometimes more.  Lots of names have come and gone and some are still around. However, the one thing I have learnt is that when all feels like it’s going to fail, developers are quiet, news is all negative, that is when the real work is being done. They are the times to be excited and delve in and learn as much as you can. 
Have I sold any Coins ? No. I always bought something and then bought more back straight away. This drove my wife crazy ! I have though moved all my coins several times and sold all the forks (most recently diamond and super bitcoin - this is one key reason to keep all your coins in your own keys). This allowed me to treat my wife to shopping sprees down and also a new home last year with the bcash fork (still have a small mortgage - I’m not crazy - I bought more btc !). 
I do still work but don’t need to. Btc has given me a huge safety net but I stilll put aside cash savings, load up my pension so I get my employer match and overpay the mortgage. If this all went belly up I would be fine and have some really great hodling memories. 
I have changed a lot about myself. I am stronger than I thought, I recognise FOMO in myself and have to self correct. I have discovered I am not as selfish as I thought I was but also that I am lazier than I want to be. I need to remember that the best investment I can now make is in me. I exercise daily and eat well. I have to work hard at these things but I am pleased to have been given the chance to face into them. 
Regarding btc and it’s future. They will be different times, just like 2009-11 and 2011-2013 were different times. 2013-2016 has its own story and 2017-2020 (and onwards) will as well. 
I am personally looking forward to the halving (yes, the last halving talk started about 2 years early - circa 2014- as well !) and also 2nd layer solutions growing as we see today with increasing node counts in lightening. This is really exciting. 
I do wish to be able to contribute in some way to the success of bitcoin and try to respect what it is all about (to me this is freedom and helping others). I truly believe in it. 
As an aside my favourite btc character on this whole journey is Artforz. What a story this guy/gal has.   and my favourite moments were the memes we had when taking down the great bearwhale 30k btc wall. I am proud to have helped eat that wall just a little !
Anyway. Good to chitchat. I don’t often do it in here. I wish you all the best of luck and strong hands. Remember, this is a paradigm shift (perhaps once in our lifetime) and no matter what we are all part of the revolution. There will be stories told of this time and movies made. We are truly privileged.

What would happen if suddenly all USA banking relationships were allowed ? Would tether accounts get migrated to USD accounts ? Would tether seize to exist ?

What about Kraken ? At the very least they should have a 1:1 holding as they issue the USD to tether pair ?
If that’s the case why aren’t exchanges asking for a formal audit as they are on the line as well. Can it be the case exchanges can just seize trading tether and send them back to Bitfinex and ask for a refund. People are in tether for a reason and it’s not because they want other coins, they want the USD. 
Any exchange at anytime could decide to remove a tether pair. What would they do with the tethers. Someone somewhere is going to expect some USD. Is Bitfinex going to wire it across. 
Any exchange that holds tethers is liable for the equivalent USD in the eyes of the holders.

I am no bcash or Ver fan but it does need to be acknowledged the role Ver played very early on in Bitcoins life. The Book ‘Digital Gold’ goes into detail but whether we like it or not he has carved a place in the history books of bitcoin. Whether he has a future is up to him. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:57:14
It’s not Bitfinex that need worry. It’s Binance, Houbi, OKex, Polo, HITbtc etc. Bitfinex probably have enough (equivalent in USD or other currency) to cover their holdings. Can the other exchanges say the same ? 
Any exchange that is holding a tether should also be holding the equivalent USD. Is Bitfinex holding all these other exchanges USD for them ? I would say not.

Yep. Not a good idea. 
Why don’t we go ahead and do that with your coins ? Ohh, you didn’t steal them you say, if you could just prove that before we unfreeze your account that would be great. 
These things sound like good tech ideas to start with but then with deeper thinking the downsides are pretty apparent.

It’s not true until it’s true. These guys only say what they want you to hear. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:41:59
How would a token like Tether collapse ? Is this through Hyperinflation of the tether token or a complete freeze or something else ? 
A freeze would be difficult because it’s across so many exchanges (admittedly it could start off with one exchange then quickly cascade across others - but would lead to a bank run) and the hyperinflation would just keep pushing the BTC or any pair buy price higher and higher to maintain the 1:1 ratio. 
I see tethers aim as very similar to that of the MAKER Dai in ETH. I don’t see how tether can maintain its 1:1 without continually printing. 
One way or another this will come to ahead. One thing we all know about crypto in general is that it likes to take the path of most pain. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:45:37
This is the difference between platform tokens and a store of value coin.

The correction will come when you feel like there is no hope left and you have moved your cold storage all onto Coinbase and you’re about to hit the sell button. 
You are constantly tired by thinking of how you should have sold at the top because it was so obvious. What goes up like that and then doesn’t come back down ! Right !
The FUD starts to ring true and everything you see is bad news and lower lows. Several paydays have gone by and you thought you had bought the dip but you continue to be proven wrong.  
You think the end is coming. Bitcoin is dead. 
But then a miracle happens, you come across the white paper again and catch a glimpse of the continual development that’s taking place. You see a small bit of news where we are breaking new ground while all the superficial talk was on bear markets and tulips. You see hash rate jump and wonder what brought it on. You see the lightening network has grown to several thousand nodes when the last time you saw it it was under 100. You then think that actually it’s not all that bad. 
By this time you have grown stronger and wiser. You know more about the tech than ever before and know how it will change the world. You add a little more to your stash. It feels exciting again like you have rediscovered it for the first time. Others begin to feel the same. An uptick occurs, you buy a little more. Your DCA is as low as ever and every little increase has a multiplier effect. 
You have now developed level 1 strong hands. Your next level is earned with the next cycle, then the next. You think back and you see that we are witnessing a paradigm shift and all the price talk was just a distraction. This journey is what counts and in 20 years you will have a great story to tell.

No address with near anything with 1M coins. See linked for all addresses of top coins. 
On the halving, in my view this is the key one. This brings coin inflation to a level on par with general inflation and as you say reduce coins mined per day to 900. The next 1.5 yrs is going to be incredible. I am taking advantage of these dips where I can. Short term ups and downs mean nothing unless your a day trader. I’m a collector so it just means it cost less fiat to add to my collection.
Hodl tight. I wish you the best out there !
Edit: The conversation we’ve had is what it to me means when people say ‘zoom out’. It’s not just about day/week/month charts but overall ecosystem but also (not discussed) technology. Looking at charts hr by hr can impact a broader perspective. Sometimes I think this is done on purpose to induce FUD and scare people out of their coins due to the above. We are quickly approaching a point that won’t work (on btc at least).

What country do you live in ? How is your currency treating you ? 
Just a few years ago in one if the worlds richest country’s (UK) the £ lost more than 10% to the $ in a single day and still has not recovered. That has an impact whether you know it or not. 
Again, from a UK perspective i’m glad you weren’t a recent customer of TSB otherwise you account was completely locked down as their systems failed for over a week. It didn’t matter what credit card you had. 
Have you ever had your identity stolen ? How about a direct debit setup on your account without your permission ? How about any pulled money from your account without your permission ? 
Have you ever been barred from buying something by your bank card provider ? What’s it like having your account frozen for no reason or the cash you have on your person taken without your consent due to a traffic stop ? 
I’m in the UK so I have it pretty easy. However I am aware of the billions of people who today don’t have any way of transferring wealth outside of cash or outside of their community. They don’t have bank accounts and most likely never will as they wont fit the criteria (it’s difficult to get a bank account without an identity). 
These are just random examples of the system your currency lives within. From a currency perspective being able to buy stuff easily is a very small fraction of what it is. No one wants to have any extra friction when it will stop you buying something so they make it look easy and give you trinkets but that doesn’t mean as a currency the system will continue working for you.

How does Coinbase (I pick them because of their institution like focus) continue to support Bitcoin Cash. 
I don’t mind forked coins at all and support that. But Bitcoin Cash continually cheating and lying while knowingly tricking people is beyond me. Everyone is aware what they are doing, even at institutional level. 
I enjoy using Coinbase due to its ease and simplicity. However **I’m going to stop using them and find another provider**. 
In many ways Coinbase legitimised BCH by adding them to their exchange. We know that was an error and in hindsight they should too. I cannot continue to consider Coinbase a professional business with this mind. 
Something needs to change and I will be moving from exchanges and not using providers who support BCH due to their known clear manipulation and cons.

~~I’m unsure if your joking or not but personally I think that is a really terrible idea and doesn’t in any way solve the underlying problem.~~ 
Edit: I think I misunderstood. I thought you meant swap bitcoin and btc reddits but obviously you meant move all r\btc over to r\bch. That seems a logical step as BTC is the ticker and abbreviation used for Bitcoin and not any other coin. It would though completely remove the point of why bch squats on r\btc.

I read a comment yesterday that the a key reason bitcoin gold/private/diamond et etc have any value is because of all the people who have not yet claimed their fork coins. 
I looked a bit further and take for example this address: 3DwBwG6khA63MSCgjrhBRRVpEBibbHuur9
This has an interesting history and is active over the end of last year from a long period of dormancy. The owner had held 40,000 coins and split them up. Most recently went to a bech32 format address with 10,000 in 3DwB .... I thought if they took the time to do this then they may have also taken the opportunity to claim forked coins. I also assume thats why they left 10,000 coins in a legacy format address as I’m not sure if the bc1... format addresses can claim forked coins (most likely i’m completely wrong). The owner did in fact at the same time go onto move the 40,000 bch in 19Mz2o9....on the bch network and proceeded to what I can see is sell (after they moved the btc coins from that address). This was 3 days after the fork. 
I cannot see the same activity though for any other forked coin (btc gold etc) even though they own the private keys to 40,000 coins and at todays value this is over $2.8M. All I can assume is that there an no exchanges they feel safe with moving these kind of funds which is different to bch as bch was an Coinbase from day 1 and many others. 
This guy however: 1AYLzYN7SGu5FQLBTADBzqKm4b6Udt6Bw6 has not moved a single coin on any network since 2011. Nor any forked coin. Could we assume then that these coins are lost. I understand hodling btc but not gold/private/diamond etc. These are opportunities to get extra bitcoin but in many cases has not been taken. Many of the top 100+ addresses it seems have moved coins (and perhaps claimed bch) but many in the 2000-6000 have not. These make up a significant lump of assumed available btc and I wonder if we could someway compare all addresses and see who has moved coins to claim fork coins on any forked network to identify what maybe a truly lost key. 
Forked coins offer an incentive to move coins about. An address with 2500 btc had in November $700k in bitcoin gold alone. Today it is worth *only* $112k and is available on Binance. I would be all over this. There must be a reason these have not moved and previously we could only assume the owner hodled and wanted more btc. However with all the forked coins at their disposal this shows its not perhaps the case. 
Is this another way to identify coins that have had their keys lost or now not accessible. If so could we assume then that these coins will not ever be for sale and hence not available to institutions who maybe thinking that they have a pool of 14M coins to target when in fact it could be much smaller.  
This was my point. I think large brokers or institutions see 14M coins and think they’ll one day get there hands on them or that once the price is right these coins will enter the market. I don’t think this will happen as the owners of these coins have had several hundred thousand $ worth of incentive and not touched a thing, even knowing that their btc will not be impacted in any way other than an address change. This tells me the pool of assumed coins available to large players is perhaps only a fraction of what they think. There is not enough coins on exchanges to satisfy any large holder. In my view time is running out for anyone that wants to take and hodl anything over 5k btc ($40M) which is in the scheme of things nothing. When this is perhaps realised all hell will break lose.  I hope you bought a ticket :)

@_date: 2018-05-30 23:43:28
I am on the same page as you. This is what I see. 
They want to take over the complete identity (including historical context) of Bitcoin. They will do whatever they can to manipulate the language (including the Whitepaper) to speak their own version of the truth.  
The use terms like Bitcoin Core Vs Bitcoin Cash full well knowing these terms are apples and oranges. They are fixated on certain teams working in the Bitcoin code and all the while not seeing the contradiction that is happening in BCH. They complain about figure heads but look to a few key players to make their choices. 
But most importantly, they want to present Bitcoin as a fork just like Bitcoin Cash (thats why they call it Bitcoin Core). They want people to think there were two splits that day and the chain historically called Bitcoin was lost and broken into 2 new paths (not a Bitcoin chain with a forked BCH branch). They want to remove Bitcoins historical context so that can claim a moral high ground and then centre their arguments on a few things like blocksize to win the right to claim what they consider to be an ‘available’ naming right (hence why they buy up all the domains etc). 
They hate that they were forced to fork off the main chain due to lack of support and don’t accept that that happened (RV think he has earned some higher rights here). They deeply wanted that rich history and context so they could claim some higher ground. They still want that, and the way they have chosen to take it is by using misinformation, non truths and misdirection. As far as they are concerned Bitcoin died and is just waiting to be reclaimed by Bitcoin Cash when we all see the light. Until then, they see Bitcoin as being squatted on.
BCH will never be BTC. Its physically, scientifically and philosophically impossible. They know this so they are trying their best to relabel Bitcoin as something new (They chose Bitcoin Core) that is only a year or so old. What they didn’t count on was all the people who are in it for more than naming rights and don’t follow what they are blindly told to do - but run their own code, use tools such as UASF and run full nodes that we use for making transactions and pointing SPV tools at. 
The fork called BCH have lost their way, they continually look over their shoulder, they don’t accept responsibility for their own actions and in my view have become what in many ways they set out to destroy (centralised control entities). They are slowly losing the argument (even within their own camp) but chose to ignore this by just shouting louder and louder. There is a certain irony in it all really, the harder they push on Bitcoin, the more it evades them. It is them that will ultimately end up destroying themselves.

You only tell half the story and one sided at that. 
Generally when I read anyone mentioning Bitcoin Core they are comparing it to Bitcoin Cash. This is apples and oranges as one is a reference implementation and the other the name of a forked coin. This is generally done to mislead and cause confusion, ultimately with malicious intent. 
The only group of people who call Bitcoin ‘Bitcoin Core’ are a group who behave (and seem to think) the best way to be a success is to spend all their time making sure others fail.
I’m not sure you’ve thought of it this way.

Many Altcoin were only created to circumvent fiat issues and create hype to enable the Altcoin controllers to buy as much Bitcoin as possible. 
Once that facade falls they will have filled their bags with Bitcoin and achieved what they set out to do - get as much BTC as possible, for as little of their own $ as possible and if possible, by using your $.

You are lucky then. For many it is a common occurrence. 
Out of interest in Jan 2014 you could buy 1.06 CAD  for $1, now you can now buy 1.28 CAD. More than a 20% decline in 4 years. This impacts things like property, rents, cost of milk. Some countries experience that every week. Its very difficult to save for retirement, pay your bills or get meaningfully paid for work in these situations. There could be many people jn Canada who get their pensions in CAD but live in the states converting to $ who now see a significantly reduced quality of life. That act of making the payment though is very easy, it’s just a click of a button. Doesn’t mean the currency is working for them. 
Developing countries require stable currencies to initiate and fulfil their basic needs. Non of these guys get to use the stock market for instance to support or beat inflation. That’s a luxury.  We can do this anytime. They don’t have access in any meaningful way. Bitcoin isn’t going to solve all these things but owning your own wealth and identity will go along way. Being able to move, without the need of a 3rd party, your assets seamlessly and almost instantly supports independence and the opening up of investment opportunities.  Even just having the option to keep their wealth (in a stable coin, which can be easily accessed instantly in a permission-less way) will give pause for thought. 
Moving towards the future. My car cant have a bank account, how is it going to pay for things it needs ? I’m not letting any IoT device have access to a transfer system that operates via a pull system rather than push. To me that’s just crazy. How do we progress the IoT using our current value transfer system ? In my mind we can’t, not without ceding full control to a fully centralised system or by taking full control ourselves. 
I’m rambling now. You and I are lucky. We get paid reliably, probably get paid sick leave, we have pensions, we save and can acquire bitcoin if we wanted because we have disposable income. We live in locations where there is a stable body of law. 
On how Bitcoin solves my problems, Previously I had to be 100% in the system whether I liked it or not. Now I have a choice, that in itself is incredibly powerful.

I’ve never been to another sub before that constantly talks about an alternative coin to what what the sub was created for in the first place (it actually isn’t staying true to its history and initial reason for being set). 
If they discussed new ideas that could move bitcoin forward then fine but they constantly (in a btc sub) talk about BCH, a completely different coin.
It’s like specifically buying a sub titled ‘ManU’ but continually talking about Real Madrid and how Real Madrid should actually be Manchester United because Ronaldo now plays there.

Agree with u/hanakookie. I’m not sure they could get the qty of coins they would need. Yes, they could play the markets but that isn’t going to get them near it. Draper bought 30,000 coins and that’s a drop in the ocean (in $ terms) for these guys and not an everyday block purchase. 
Bitcoinity shows circa 75k coins traded over a 24 hr period, thats less than 1% of all coins available (ignoring wash trading etc). Keep in mind that there are just 1800 btc mined per day and in 1.5 yrs time that will drop to 900. 
As far as I can see there are very roughly 800k-1000k coins moved per day (bitinfocharts) on chain. Thats circa 5% of all coins but importantly 95% of all coins are held/hodl’d/cold stored. I assume in here there are big OTC moves from the likes of Circle etc. It’s a shame there is no clear days destroyed chart to see if these are the same coins moving around each day. 
It all sums up to me that if big money (i’m not necessarily thinking banks here) don’t have their coins yet (and I don’t by any stretch think that they *all* do) then it will be much harder to attain any sufficiently large qty.

I disagree with nearly everything you said. A lot of us have been around for a long time and were part of the journey over these last years. I ran my UASF node and made my choice. 
I have nothing against Bitcoin Cash. I don’t approve of many things about how it decides to operate so I don’t run the software or use the coin. If BCH went about its own business then fine but it doesn’t. I don’t need to point out many examples as they are numerous with the most obvious being using the bought r\btc sub to promote bch.

I have used this to buy a product recently. I then used the Coinbase app to make the BTC payment (using the same device - iPhone) and I found that the Coinbase app didn’t add the mining fee to the total and took it off the requested total (because I had to manually enter the transaction details). 
This meant that it couldn’t find the transaction and the 15 min payment window timed out and I had to speak with the sellers, contact Coinbase Commerce etc etc. My mistake was that I thought it would prefil the Coinbase app once opened and it didn’t (and didn’t think on the mining fee as thought it was included - stupid, I know). 
Has anyone else experienced this ?

You know you were dead right when you said bitcoin is ‘sticky’. Once in, you’re in. You’ve discovered it, invested a little time to understand it and maybe even bought a little. You could then sell it all but no matter what you have still participated. You’re in. 
Whether or not it’s a good investment, bitcoin and crypto is the next natural step. To me there is no getting away from it. It’s not in my mind feasible to have the internet without a decentralised layer of value across it. Bitcoin captures this nicely. It’s just the order of things, like space flight after the invention of the plane.

I don’t think I’m getting my points across very well. 
Your initial comment was about how your currency is not treating you badly and that your cards work well. I tried yo provide areas where it has treated you/others badly and also areas it can fall down and that others don’t have the luxury of even bank accounts let alone contactless payments. Some don’t even have an ‘identity’ (birth certificates, credit history, ability to access/manage credit etc) so have no hope participating in the current financial system. Total exclusion. 
I also looked wider to explain how developing  countries can benefit from a system like Bitcoin rather than a incumbent currency that perhaps is not working or will ever work. I commented that Bitcoin can provide some levels of financial independence and also commerce with out having to go through the whole ‘bank account’ stage (and hence require identity), just like the developing countries didn’t need to go though laying miles of landlines to get to cell phones. This can help many many people. 
I then also tried to explain how the future of value transfer (maybe 20 years away still) needs to change (probably a poor example using cars but is an obvious one) as the current system won’t work without us giving up all control. I used IoT as an example as in the future we will expect our devices to make payments on our behalf and negotiate smart contracts. I don’t want a device that will do that tied to a pull system of value transfer, especially not one controlled by a 3rd party.  
Anyway. I failed.

To add, much of the alt coin boom through last year was an indirect mechanism to acquire btc and Eth without diverting $ funds. They ride the PnD and after each wave move into btc and the cycle restarts. I think this is the more sophisticated and well connected whale types who could then go into support block trades but also need to remember it’s all about accumulation and positioning. 
Why sell the future for the past, no one wants to be out of position when the bell rings. The recent bear market is just to shake a few trees; these guys want a set qty of btc not a $ amount. This in itself makes it difficult with lower volume. For the average Joe who targets a coin or two you can do this anytime on Coinbase buying up those 0.1 btc sales. I’m not sure that can support institutional buying over a prolonged period of time. It’s just too little. 
On a separate note it would be interesting to compare btc fork volumes to see who’s accessing and moving coins. It might give a further clue as to what’s in deep cold storage and unavailable.

Well lightning is instant and suits lower value transactions. 
I understand the prudence but then there is a pragmatism that needs to be applied. I’m not sure a double spend would be attempted on a $4 transaction so perhaps 0 conf would work in that situation.

*Stratum requires the pool to select the work. This means that, from the Bitcoin network’s point of view, the pool acting as the miner instead of the hardware owner/operator, drastically increasing effective miner centralization and crippling the Bitcoin system’s ability to achieve some of its key goals.*
Sounds great ! All for giving the power of selecting the work back to the hash rate owner. 
Question: What’s the benefit of separate mining pools with the above in mind and does this reduce the effectiveness of a pool ?
*getblocktemplate’s pull-based architecture prevents Bitcoin Core from implementing various tweaks to further improve latency for miners.*

Just quickly, you know that the blocksize was increased to allow on average 2-3MB of transactions (can do even more) from 1MB. 
On your other question. There is enough data out there to make an informed decision for yourself. 
Here is a full list of Bitcoin Core Contributers. Have a look at whatever timescale you want to see who is involved. You can cross check this with the Blockstream team if you like.
 or  
Here is an analysis to show exactly how much influence Blockstream have using github data as a basis.
Here is the funding rounds for Blockstream:
Here is the details on sidechains:
Make up your own mind. 
My view, Blockstream are clearly not the largest funders of Bitcoin or have even a tenth as much influence as you give them. Bitcoin is open source and anyone can contribute. There is no centralised nature or threat to Bitcoin due to Blockstream, not in the slightest, so no i’m not worried at all.

I do remember when the wallet first come out (I think maybe 4 years now - iOS). The interface has changed and general way of using it has been updated but it was a recommended wallet for me in the early stages. I can’t remember which wallet come first BitPay or CoPay but they released a few (one of them was a payment system) which I quickly realised i’d got mixed up in !
Key attracting feature for me was the multisig. I still don’t know another wallet that allows you to do that. It was great (I only used the 2 of 2 option) and I would continue to use this across 2 mobiles just to see how the authorisations worked. It opened my eyes as to the possibilities of how programmable money could be utilised. 
My view of it is that it’s overall tidy. Lots if options that have been extended to of the years and some perhaps not needed. I always wanted something very simple so at the time it was competing with Bread on my phone. It didn’t win purely because I liked the way Bread used to sweep transactions (similar now but buried a little more) and you’d swipe between 2 screens - send and receive - dead easy. I personally don’t like wallets that deal in more than one coin (don’t mind ERC20 wallets) as it can be too easy to mix up - this has put me off Bread a little since i’ve been using it as well as the commercialisation of it. As an aside a key feature missing in nearly every wallet - ability to just create a simple watch only wallet. Only wallet I know that does this is BitWallet (on iOS).
My favourite wallet though was a small project I found on GitHub called Bitcoinista (not been updated for over 4 years now). It was in python and I would run it on Pythonista on my iPhone. I could literally interrogate the code and see how it all worked and try stuff out all the while sending transactions. It is a really great wallet !
I’ve not used it for a few years so may not work but give it a whirl. It’s very basic but again is pretty awesome, even today. It offers something completely new. I used to wip out my phone and open up the code and it felt pretty good. I enjoyed the learning experience if it. The link to the repo is below. Give it ago and let us know what you think :)

It’s when answers can only be provided based on the same faulty premises that generates the confusion in the first place.

Thats what I thought but was thinking about their % of network hashrate. Somebody needs to find a block so thought they may have considered if it would be them visa-vee their hash rate. 
I’m probably mixing up the two thoughts but if they had 100% of the hashrate the probability of finding a block is still the same but at least they know they would be the ones to find it. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:11:35
Yes. But ... 
No matter what, miners receive half as much bitcoin after a halving. I think they have enough reserves and forward contracts on energy etc for 6 - 9 months but after these come to close and need renewing etc the price starts to catch up. 
Just like any business they will have 5 year plans and have to estimate how the market behaves and grows. The uniqueness in this market is they cannot grow it, just take more share. Part of this planning will obviously be reduction in supply and how to respond, not just with hashrate but with mining other coins to perhaps hedge or buy btc or stake etc etc. It is so much more complicated now with all the other coins out there to help acquire the same $ value of coin to net out the reward reduction. 
Many will say hash follows price (and I tend to agree on day to day) but that to me in these unique instances of a block halving does not hold. It’s an immediate supply shock which although fully known about years’ in advance cannot be taken into account as the main costs wont be incurred for that hashrate until much closer to the date of the halving. I don’t know how they depreciate their capital spends or over what time period as an example or even if that impacts. 
I also don’t know the investment cycle of miners or how long equipment lasts (or R&amp;D cycles) but to me it is an important element.
However, as you point out there seems to be a pattern forming and unless there are other more profitable SHA256 coins, mining will always be the cheapest way to acquire btc while being able to spread or manage the cost of acquiring it.

I wasn’t clear. My comment was pointing towards pretty much what you stated. 
The original poster was talking about mining and full nodes and noted that my individual node won’t matter if not on the network because ‘who cares’ as it adds no value if not mining or an ‘economic’ node. 
Thats one perspective, but if a thousand individual non economic non mining nodes starting making noise then it can start to cause a problem. The network of course does not see any change but by virtue of me being able to run a full node I have a voice and people can chose to connect to me or not. Without that full node I have no proactive voice at all. This way I am at least 1 of ~10,000. 
Your last sentence is why I started to run my node in the first place but also to offer a place for others to connect other than miners.

I would say stay away. 
I just looked at the site and when you go through to purchase bitcoin it references it as Bitcoin Core. It then goes onto show several alerts which further confuse. At no time is Bitcoin referenced, just Bitcoin Core, which is not a coin [just a term to confuse].
In my view it is unethical of them to say ‘recommended’ on BCH as this gives the impression they (btc &amp; bch) can be used one and the same when we know they are completely different networks, not just different issuers. 
Any business purposefully misleading in this way should not be rewarded with users. I would also be weary of any support if something went wrong buying their non recommended coin. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:25:45
Dead easy !
Open up the command line on your laptop and type ‘mine’. 
It will then prompt the following:  ‘what currency - btc / eth / bcc’
For best mining results I recommend ‘bcc’. To initiate type in ‘bcc’ to the command line. 
You will then be prompted for your desired hash rate %. You can use any value here below 100 but don’t type in anything to high as it could raise suspicion of a 51% attack. Everyone tends to put about 20% to start with then every two weeks or so adjust it a bit. 
It will then ask you for the name of your mining operation. Some use generic names but something like ‘anonminer’ is pretty cool. Type this into the command line and then crucially press the tab+space bar to initialise the name. 
Immediately after you have done this it will prompt you with ‘start mining’ or ‘cancel request’. Just type ‘start mining’ in the command line and you are set and will be mining in the background on your spare pc !
Remember though to download the bitcoin address provided when you bought your computer as this will be where all your mining rewards will go. 
Simple as. Let us know how it goes. Alternatively you could google it.

My misunderstanding of the commentary. My node doesn’t broadcast what blocks it deems invalid. Fully accept that.

Great question and interesting concept of extension blocks. An interesting article discussing around these points:
*This way all old nodes will blindly follow and will no longer be able to spend their funds unless they upgraded to the new soft fork rules.*
Are you saying here every transaction including the coinbase reward is tied into an extension block ? 
Old nodes wont see the extended block but will see the base block transaction as I understand, just not what goes on afterwards. If you maintain an old node you would just see an empty block and I (or anyone) couldn’t validate a transaction. 
What would happen to the coins in the coinbase transaction as they would not be in the extension block as I see it and be free to spend after 100 confirmations on the main chain and seen by old nodes ? Am I misunderstanding something ?

Even if you did end up with lots of little bits (unspent outputs) you could just send it to another address you own and it would end up as a single input. 
Some people do this because they like to consolidate as this helps reduce fees by reducing the number of unspent outputs. 
Here is an example of 3 outputs creating a single input of 1 btc:
I can see someone with an address that held circa 1.16 btc sent 1 btc and had the ‘change’ minus the fee sent to another address they own.  The 1 btc is as now a single ‘unspent transaction output’.
Remember, it’s digital cash. You can do anything you want with it. You could break it into a million bits if you wanted. 
Note, all your coins would have a history to them to their respective coinbase transaction where they were minted. Who knows what origins your coins have !
If you wanted no history virgin like coins then you need to mine them or buy them from a miner. Btcc used to offer this a while ago for a 12.5 btc block with a 2.5btc fee on top:

Great ideas here. 
Many businesses are fully vertically integrated. They own the raw material through to the final product. 
Is there a tipping point where increasing hashrate is more expensive than improving sources of electricity (currently farms just move rather than develop sources). 
Can you see miners in the future (with your ideas in mind) either being new large scale energy producers or current energy producers moving into large scale mining.  
Also, the article doesn’t mention why blocks are created. The blocks themselves have no value if they are not being used, no matter what the hashrate. Would you agree with that ? 
Great post. Thanks for sharing. 
Edit: If hash rate is a commodity in itself its amazing to think how under utilised it is (many computers don’t hash) and also how decentralised it is already (it’s everywhere, just some sources are lower quality than others) . Also, how it has been hiding in plain sight for the last 40-50 years.

Thanks for your thoughts. Appreciated. Good topic of discussion. 
If a coinbase reward is is not in a block how can we be sure that it is 12.5 btc and a hardfork is not in progress ? I’s it possible for a block to be completely absent of any transactions, even the coinbase transaction and still be a soft fork. 
Assuming the coinbase is in the block I assume it will be seen by old nodes. I don’t know how coinbase rewards are distributed but they could just sit on the main chain, not spent. That could carry on indefinitely block after block supported by the 49%. 
Additionally, if a user saw with their full node that a soft fork had taken place (they would say still run their non soft forked node) they could just ‘hodl’ so no more coins can enter the extension block except say 2 blocks worth from the start of the soft fork (I don’t know how long a soft fork like this would take to be seen). 
Would I also be right in thinking that all coins not spent since the soft fork was activated by the 51% attack ate also on the main chain ?

This is where my mind was going. A single large pool - with the ability to pick your own work and direct your hashes as you wish but with the knowledge of gaining a steady more regular btc income. 
With that in mind, I would be now be willing to run a miner.
I would be able to ensure a steady btc return (no matter how small) without compromise or 3rd party trust (and not take the hit by solo mining). 
In the end if the pool is large enough you could generate btc regularly. Depending upon how mining ASICs progress who knows what equipment/hardware we could end up pointing at this pool in the future. 
If I understand this correctly I think this is a significant step for individual miners. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:15:55
It would be good to make clear that ‘Core’ refers to the Bitcoin implementation ‘Bitcoin Core’ not that they are a core (i.e centralised) team. When some people say ‘Core’ they mix up the noun and proper noun. There are other Bitcoin implementations suchs as Bitcoin Knots or BTCD that maintain the same consensus rules. 
You are free to chose any implementation but it just happens that the Bitcoin Core implementation is favoured and run by the most people and runs out of the Bitcoin git repository. Previous to Bitcoin Core there was Bitcoin-QT. No one went around saying QT was centralised.
You are right. Coinbase or others could have simply forked the code and created their own version and offered it out. It didn’t even need to be any different and maintain current consensus rules but just have commit access by others to get their pull requests merged. They could have then said “hey, everyone, come use our implementation as we promise to do other stuff”. But they didn’t. They just complained instead. 
Others who claimed they had full community support, 90% miner backing as well as full ecosystem support didn’t even bother to do this. They hard forked rather than simply become the defacto Bitcoin implementation which by their own claims should have been easy. They still moan about this today, even though they didn’t even try as you say to hire a team to get this done. There is actually a button on guthub designed for this very thing, its a single click. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:05:11
Thanks. Fully appreciate with a continued supermajority of miners a soft fork could be instigated. It doesn’t sit with me that the mechanism described to enforce extension blocks is infallible so as to eliminate the ability of old nodes to make some sort of on chain transactions. 
I’m thinking around the coinbase transaction here as it is the only transaction that needs to take place that old nodes can see. 
On the coinbase reward, I don’t believe you can change the reward value and maintain a soft fork as its part of the block validation. My understanding is that since the incident several years ago where a miner paid themselves less than the available block reward its validation was hard wired in.
Perhaps this is important as at least all future generated coins will be on chain at some point and so seen by old nodes and not directly the extension chain. I also suppose as the miners own these rewards they would asap spend them to the extension block. I suppose this is the case with all cold stored coins as well as there is a migration period to the extension block initiated by spending them. That gives us all at least one transaction to get coins onto the LN to keep them out of the extension block and still in effect spendable as Bitcoin and recognised by old nodes on the main chain if/when a channel is closed. Every channel open today would be redeemable to a BTC address on chain. 
As an aside, do you think non mining nodes could counter with their own soft fork reducing the size of the space in the coinbase field so the merkle root couldn’t fit ? 
Edit: as another aside could a UASF be used to increase minimum number of blocks from a coinbase reward being spendable from 100 to say 10,000. This would cut off all generated funding for the attack. But again doesn’t tackle the direct problem at hand. 
I’m no expert. I’m waffling on.

There are lots of ways to be an exchange or an intermediary. None are easy, none at all. Shapeshift.io are great and act to transfer one coin seamlessly to another. Not an exchange as such but a transfer mechanism. They take fees in the way of spread and buying coins from various exchanges. 
You could try opening your own physical shop and acting as a local broker somehow and then move into more sophisticated activities. Get a website and build a reputation. In the UK bitbrokers are one example on localbitcoins of this. You could buy and install ATMs around the region and offer competitive fees etc. You could create a site like lightningspin.com etc on LN. Perhaps you could start a meet up and get involved with like minded people to kick start the process. You could go another way and ‘stake’ in Eth or run a LN node and claim fees (you could run hundreds of them if you wanted). 
I’m spitballing as it seems you want to jump in and make an exchange with no understanding, experience or understanding of any legislation but reading between the lines you may just want to understand how you might go about achieving a passive income from crypto. unfortunatly, if it was easy we would all be doing it. Don’t take my comments as negative, just trying offer alternative ideas.

Something poitive ....
The price of bitcoin won’t change because people worry about it. That changes nothing, so don’t worry about it. 
There is significantly more room up than there is down. 
The only coins that are selling are the ones on exchanges. I don’t see any cold storage being popped open and I don’t expect to. Why sell at $6k but not at $20k if money was a motivator ?
You drop btc by 10% and you get every other alt for a 20% discount. Bitcoin is being used as a mule to move the whole price range of all coins so people can get a final fill of their favourite projects before they all release. 
Crypto has been the only asset class that the everyday person has been able to get in well ahead of the institutions. They have been waiting since 2014 for red tape to move to get in. I don’t think they are happy about this and could be taking it out on us now. Don’t worry about the tantrums. 
Business (new ones and well known) have been working in the background for 3 years now and they are ready to release their projects. Once one will they will all rush too. 
The technology front is changing the world. The internet is a game changer but without a native programable value transfer mechanism it now looks and feels so flat. Crypto gives this thing it’s 3D form. We haven’t even begun to realise the possibilities. Our children will wonder how we coped without it just like todays children wonder how we communicated without mobiles.
All the good news being shown but not changing anything is just massive potential energy. It only takes a single spark and the ecosystem will explode. It feels to me everything is getting primed. 
We talk about repeating the 2014 bear market but this is not logical. There is no reason to follow that timing just like we didn’t just repeat the 2014 ATH. This is 2018. No group buying now is interested in waiting for an ecosystem worth just $250B to grow if we just wait 3 more years. They have profits to make and clients to please, dividends to be paid. You cant do that by shrinking a market - what do you do in year 2 or 3 ? Fire all the crypto guys and move into .... what exactly ? What upcoming technology is going to create such massive opportunities outside of crypto that can be as quickly tuned into ? This new economy is going into the trillions whether we like it or not. It will bring everyone with it. The good, the bad. 
A low price will never kill bitcoin. It ran for a very long time without any price whatsoever. It only got into double digits in 2013. What will kill bitcoin is people not using it or turning off their nodes. That won’t happen because I use it and I will always run my node. 
I have never felt so positive about Bitcoin big ‘B’ or bitcoin little ‘b’. I get shivers just thinking about it.

I’m going to say I thought this was impossible and was hard wired into the code after it occurred in block 124724. Obviously I was completely wrong. 
I’m astounded. This must be one of the largest reductions in actual Bitcoin issuance ever. They are not even lost, they will effectively never exist. 
What I find interesting is that btc.com also mined the preceding and also the following block. Was it cheaper for them to build on top of this block than try for a new block and claim the full reward. 
Is anyone with a better understanding than I able to weigh in. Dan-from-San-Diego ? *[Just joking :)]*
*My initial thoughts. I think something fishy is going on with btc.com and what/the way they are mining.*
Edit: For info Blocks 526590 and 526591 were mined at exactly the same time by btc.com with block 526591 being empty apart from the coinbase transaction.

Also, its actually nothing like how Fiat was backed by gold. Why would anyone do that !

I have in the past asked them to accept Bitcoin but they said it was not in their plans. 
Ultimately the barrier here for me to donate is that I don’t want to have to provide my details or go through their payment forms for a one off donation (even to my payment provider). Especially as the request generally starts with ... ‘While you’re here’, at the bottom of every article and presents itself as a donation. In those instances I just want to be anonymous and simply give a donation.
I’ll happily donate if I can just pull out my phone and scan a QR and pay in electronic cash, but not by card or paypal. It’s just too much friction.
The RNLI allows this on their donations page and have been accepting BTC for several years and successfully receive donations every few days.

Personally, I like these times as it means being able to catch up with the tech talk rather than sift through price talk all the time.  The fundamentals are much stronger today than even a few months ago and through the year into next year I expect to see a greater explosion of interest that supports price appreciation.

In 2014 I used to have a twitter handle (won’t say what it was) and would post a private key QR image hash tagging bitcoin. I would put $5 in. I did this circa 20 times over a few months. They were never taken so swept them all back again.

Agreed. Similar to ‘Send Max’ on GDAX withdrawals. 
I am not too sure on setting your own sat/bit fee. Perhaps an arrow or something that increases/decreases from a suggested fee. I am always concerned that a user no matter how experienced messes this up so a starting point is always useful. 
If I could state a third item it would be to be able to export your transaction history somehow. As far as I am aware you can’t do this. I have used Bread since day one and it would be good to get some data out as I tend to sweep or send to Bread then onwards when moving coins.

Agree about Barclays. To get you into the overdrawn position they would structure your spend to have the most negative impact Vs your income. Sometimes up to 3 days for transactions to go through in a debit card spend to find out they stitched you up. Then you were lumbered overdrawn fines as well as a fee to make the payment that put you overdrawn in the first place as well as unauthorised overdraft fees.

You can grow as a person by having obligations, responsibility and commitment. It’s when they start dragging you down or anchoring you to a path you don’t want to go down they can become a problem.  
Making a commitment, having responsibility and keeping obligations to yourself (as well as others) are things that also give depth and meaning. Be sure not to miss out on the rewarding experiences throughout life OP by skimming across the top of it. 
PS: what OP maybe talking about is financial freedom which is in many ways different to just owning bitcoin. Bitcoin allows you to be free from fiat restrictions but does not necessarily grant you financial freedom. You still need to be financially responsible no matter what you do. Anyway, ultimately, your health is your wealth.

I was referencing your comments on store of value and your how you have defined this. On intrinsic value, Bitcoin has intrinsic value, perhaps you just don’t attribute value to those properties. I do. If you don’t recognise them it does not mean they are not present. 
Yes, Bitcoin is not a good currency at the moment, but it can be. It will take many stages of adoption. Remember it’s upgradable and can grow. It’s programmable money. A house is not a good currency nor is a bar of gold. I can’t use gold on the internet. The Venezuelan bolívar is not stable but is a currency. Just not a good one. The dollar has not been a good store of value, just a reference point.

Hitbtc and Gate.io from memory. Little by little. You can find the exchanges from CoinmarketCap. Here is an example: 
Remember ! Take care of your initial BTC. You will be (depending on how you have your private keys setup) messing with many digits between several devices. Keep in mind confirmation times of the other chains and non confirmations in the other exchanges (I waited 36 hrs at one time as the confirmations were just not coming). 
Happy to help. Now... who nows how to move Bitcoin God ?
Edit: As a side note places like Binance etc credited holders of BTC with their forked coins as some other exchanges did as well. However that does not mean you can deposit those coins to the exchange to trade so it can be very trial and error.

I know I would regret not being part of a run up more than I regret being part of the drop down. 
I can take the sustained lows as I only invest what I can afford to lose. But also knowing, and having to deal with myself, possibly buying back fewer coins in the future is to me not worth the risk (or mental anguish), even though in hindsight the drop seems so obvious. Dwelling on coins that I held but had let go is more painful to me than seeing the reduced fiat equivalent. Especially at this stage of the cycle. 
I 100% believe in this project. I have since I first had the epiphany and it all clicked. We still have so far to go. So I, like you, buy the dips as I see them and gently add to my cold storage. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:09:32
Maybe we are pushing on the wrong button. I’m not against marketcap as a metric but having dodgy exchanges drive the price around on wash trades seems wrong. Perhaps we have to factor the qty of coins into an exchange on a hourly basis as a leveller. Some sort of k factor. 
Localbitcoins is telling. I don’t know of a localneo or localripple. Having a dedicated exchange just like this shows how far bitcoin is ahead in many respects. 
Maybe we just need some decent decentralised exchanges. Or perhaps in the end it doesn’t matter as 1 btc = 1 btc.

From my experience it is very difficult to increase your stash of coins by selling, especially if you are not an experienced day trader.  Just like everyone cannot be above average. If we could all see the tops and bottoms they wouldn’t be there. Are we all going to sell with the plan to buy more coins at lower levels ? The coins just won’t be available. 
Just hodl and buy more of the dips. You now have a little dry powder in case it goes lower but only ~60% your initial. As soon as this starts to move up you immediately loose out. What’s changed for you to think BTC isn’t a valuable asset any longer ? 
The whole point of these dips is for large holders to take your coins. They don’t care about $ amount they want more BTC, more specifically, they want your BTC and you gave it to them and they paid you with your money.  
I myself would not be happy sitting this revolution out. You need skin in the game for it to mean anything. Don’t give in !
I hope it all works out for you OP.

What do you think they do with the forked coins ? 
At the very least the have the following that can be traded across several exchanges:

BItcoin Diamond - $22.49
Bitcoin Gold - $122.27
Super Bitcoin - $24.18
B2X - $9.27
At 3813 BTC that is $5.4M alone on the table.

A quick overview taken from Medium: 
*Prism.exchange created by CEO of ShapeShift Erik Voorhees, simplifies things a lot. Using just Ethereum you can create a smart contract to form a Prism portfolio. Inside of this portfolio you can pick and choose multiple cryptocurrency assets as well as the percentage they hold in the prism.
The total value of the prism is affected by the market movements of each asset that makes up the total portfolio. The maximum amount of ether a prism can be created with is 10 ETH.*
It’s basically an exchange driven via smart contracts using Shapeshifts’ access to the markets. ShapeShift will put up the collateral on the other side of the bid but this will be changing later in.

It’s also about proving ownership. They can pass you the title via the blockchain to your own address and you can then you have provenance. You can then do this when selling to again prove title exchange. You can of course add images as a hash along with it.

Agreed, but there is also the feeling that by buying crypto you are also buying into the community of that coin. You don’t really get that with shares. The whole experience of owning crypto is rewarding in itself by virtue of that than by buying a plain index fund. There is very much an experience factor at play here. 
Edit: Additionally I want to add, no one has ever asked my how Barclays is doing today or how is GE doing ? They do ask me how is Bitcoin doing or how is Ethereum doing (or VEN or NANO or LTC or NEO etc). This is very much asked in the context of Bitcoin (big B) and bitcoin (little b). You can’t really do the same with shares.

Great to hear but they have been lucky. 
Tinfoil hat firmly on: 
This crash (and mempool reduction) has helped them consolidate their dust at negligible fee cost compared to a few weeks ago where they said segwit was not in their top 5 of things to do. No doubt it will be said they waited for 0.16 but I doubt that. Interested to see how they support BCH going forwards, now they have what was a multi-million problem (people’s coins held in addresses were worth less than the fees to move them) is now hopefully behind them. 
It seems just too coincidental that their support for bcash, address consolidation issues, raising miners fee and then being on the hook for millions (some even calling a fractional reserve) all come at once in a chorus against Bitcoin by pushing a bcash narrative. 
I have full confidence that they will now quickly introduce new coins (spread the risk) and bump down vocal bcash support (why would they now want to be aligned with them). Anything to get them out of the hell they have been in for the last year or so. Let’s wait and see. As far as I can see this crash has been the best thing for them that could’ve happened. 
No way to prove any of it. Just some crazy thoughts.

Welcome to the adventure ! 
Try out several apps and send small amounts of btc to yourself to see how it works. Do your own research. 
Learning about the cypherpunks and their history and the technology they created/promoted helps provide an understanding of the technology behind bitcoin. 
Learning about the history of money and how money works and is created helps give some foundation to how bitcoin is changing things. 
Being your own bank is not easy and brings responsibility. Make sure you’re ready for that. To some that means wanting to run their own node. To others it means buying a hardware wallet or improving awareness of IT and security. 
Learn the difference between cold and hot storage and offline and online wallets. I like to keep all my coins offline in cold storage with a little in my phone hot wallet.
If you don’t own the private key your don’t own the coins. If you are not sure what that means then you need to do more research. 
Don’t try to time the markets. In many ways time in the market is better than timing the market. 
This is still relatively new. Everyone knows it is volatile. Please don’t be surprised when it is volatile. 
Hodl strong, there are many parties who want your coin and make you feel the project is over to get it. They have been doing this since 2009. 
Only invest what you can afford to lose. Easy way I found was to make your lunch at home and put the money you would have spent into btc it will all add up. 
Every major technology shift was preceded with naysayers. The phone, car, lightbulb, Internet, flight etc all had people who either thought it should not be done or it was impossible so shouldn’t try. In the main this was because the new technology went against their own interests. 
We are doing this not just to improve today but to improve the future. 
We are still at the very beginning.

I’m not complaining, adding further dimensions to the network will increase its robustness and having the main chain as the solid undeniable backbone will ensure its prosperity. Holy smokes this is all moving very fast !

Coinbase aren’t shady, they are probably one of the most regulated exchanges in existence. Sure, they are not altruistic, they are just here to make money. 
How are you going to measure ‘shady’ against any other recommended exchanges ? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:56:51
It see how that was arrived at but it can be gamed very easily for little cost. You’ve also got LN etc that will thrive on lowering that number impacting the overall assessment. 
Network health (hash rate, number of nodes say), value transacted over the network, liquidity in key exchanges, days destroyed are all other indicators but just like reading a P&amp;L there is a landscape to it all. We don’t just look at the US and make an overarching assessment on its value by how many $1 notes are printed or rely purely on revenue of a business to tell us the whole story. 
Look forward to seeing what comes though.

Could it not be that Satoshi was the one adding hashing power through the first year as complimentary support to the network. 
Satoshi would have needed or had access to some network of computers to provide some testnet prior to first release. He would not have needed to run all of these upon releasing the main net code but then slowly added new machines to create a wider distribution of coin and nodes to connect to. 
He would not of been able to forecast who would stick with it or not so would have needed to increase redundancy over the first period.

You were lucky. That was not the general tone at the time (it seemed to be every other comment) and when you do join the limits are low and rarely moved up.

Although I am long bitcoin and have been for several years it should be clear that it takes much more than a high bitcoin price to become a world currency. There are so many things that a world currency needs to do - do you have any thoughts on this aside from price. We could easily say that Apple shares will become the next world currency if total marketcap alone was  the metric. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:21:44
Did this myself. Paid of my debt first though and also maxed out my pension contributions etc. The less I spent on debt the more was free for BTC. A solid motivator ! Happy to report I am still buying now. I don’t think I will ever stop ! 
Consistency is key especially in down periods like we are in. I always love these times as I could add a little more to my collection. It felt like forever but it grew.
Thinking on it, in many ways BTC was the one true thing that I actually owned and could claim as truly mine that no one could take away. That was pretty powerful for me from being in debt for a very long period.

This to me us just a start. The next few years will be telling. 
The bitcoin blockchain is effectively free for anyone to use at anytime. You can jump in and out if it at will and there is no monthly usage fee or contract. You can use as much or as little if it as you like and it’s open 24/7. 
I don’t know if there is anything quite like it.

Storage media itself has an inherent value unlike SHA256. ASICS.  If suddenly we don’t use POS we would still find the hard drives useful. The same cannot be said for POW ASICS. 
Does this inherent usefulness interfere with the neutrality of the POS function itself ? Shouldn’t the value of the function and equipment used to secure the network be neutral except explicitly when used to secure the network ? 
*I feel I am conflating two separate points above but not able to separate them in my mind as yet. I seem to remember AA talking about the benefit of having a non useful function to solve when asked why POW isn’t put to use in something like protein folding or some other important problem. *

As I understand it you can’t steal another’s’ coins but you can steal  a block reward and remove a transaction from a block (although it would still be in the mempool). You could perhaps put other miners out of business centralising mining further from the 51%. You can obviously double spend if a vendor looks for 1 x confirmation and you have 2-3 blocks up your sleeve but that would be only worthwhile on high value transactions. 
The 51% attack is just that. An attack, it’s about destroying the network and it’s trust-less state (or confidence in) not perhaps about financial gain. It would of course be easy to wait for 6 confirmations to avoid any of that. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:05:25
Great. Appreciate the feedback. Been a user of breadwallet since you released your iOS App (must be 3-4 yrs now). Always worked well but still can never seem to connect to my node.

I know several people who joined in buying bitcoin and other coins in November/Dec. I ask them how they manage their storage and they don’t have any idea. I show them an address and they wonder why I am showing them this jumble. Many don’t know what a mining is. 
I owe it to them to help them understand but many do not care more than just watching their fiat numbers move around. I get it, but it is sad. It also shows that although we have greater adoption there is no wider understanding that has come with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:26:39
Also any miner would possibly sell OTC in blocks or chunks to non retail clients rather than through Coinbase or Binance.
Not too sure how that would effect the price unless the OTC customer sent some instruction (through an agent) to achieve a market figure via some shenanigans in the retail markets.

I don’t buy into that. Litecoin still has a place and Monero will be launching this in March as I last remember. Monero, Litecoin and Bitcoin are a great complimentary trio with similar ethos. 
Regarding Monero, there is also something to be said about every transaction being private and every transaction from the very beginning of the blockchain being private. Monero provides this and this in itself has utility. 
Agree though that bulletproofs are extremely exciting. Look forward to seeing this progress.

And how much did ‘normies’ put in ? Who did these people buy through ? All through Nov/Dec we were told Coinbase was slow and took weeks for verification. Once in CB you can bet that your limits are low ($250 tops) for a few weeks and then you need to request an increase to max $1k and that takes time in itself. A wire takes several days but you need to go through the motions if verifying your account. If you’re from outside the US it is even longer. 
My estimates are that these new guys you speak of put in a few hundred and are now complaining it didn’t make them a millionaire. It will be the same guys who will FOMO back in as soon as they see the tide turn except they will have less BTC to play with. They then turn to reddit to shill and shout. They will then repeat the same cycle all over again, as is their destiny.

You are right. I mixed this up with digital content. Looking at the image Verisart do specialise in this but I could not find further info. 
I am assuming they act as a trusted signature in a multisig application that stamps the date and time of the original in the blockchain. This then is followed with a certificate that is also hashed into the transaction. This sets a datum reference  for then moving the art work around. 
However, I am not fully sure how they would know the real world piece is fact the actual original itself. I wonder if it is some sort of Steganography. I recall this from a few years back. Perhaps a similar concept is employed ?

When I think in anonymity, or privacy, between two machines or known parties my mind rolls back to the best explanation I have heard which is from Eric Hughes: 
“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”
The ability to reveal oneself is key here and should start in the foundation as a pre-requisite. AA also has a good short video on privacy and it’s impacts. I think also applies to elements such as supply chain and other tangible functions. I don’t necessarily need to know who has done what just that it has been done.

I don’t think the applications have been imagined yet. Pretty much like asking someone in 90s their view on iPhone Apps. More infrastructure is needed to leverage the technology, more developers reimagining solutions, more businesses finding applications and use cases. It will come !
There are so many things I cannot do today which seem so basic with today’s tech. I can’t sell my air miles or trade them for energy credits (or phone credits or anything). I can’t sell 1MB lots of my ‘unlimited’ phone plan or real-time access to my data plan even though it is ‘mine’. The smart grid is just being developed for solarPV panels for energy I will produce but can’t sell that to my neighbour. I can’t join a mesh network to help map inside buildings real time while I am out and about or get paid in real time for that. I can’t just drop in and out of a payment stream. This is before we talk about what real-time instant ‘cash flow’ will bring to businesses rather than static month end accounting - imagine a streaming money here that flows faster or harder depending on debits/credits using and adding in real-time. Debt and credit (and transfer and recognition of value) could be completely rethought. It is no longer static or just a series of moments. It is no longer just for humans. Humans will make the minority of value transfers. 
Think of all the things you are giving away to the likes of Google that you own. Your location (used for marketing), the temp around you (used for maps or weather which they sell), your body stats (which are sold to health care), your location (think of Waze). These things and much more you should be compensated for each and every pings worth. In game items that now have real world value - think VR and extend in that. People are going to live in that realm in 10 years time. People are going to live on Mars ! - How do we connect them into our current value system. VISA won’t cut it. 
This technology gives us the ability to assign scarcity to digital assets and then allows near instant (and free) trading of those assets in a secure and fungible way. 
We as people have not yet recognised the huge value of our data and we give this away for nothing. This is just one tangent. Trying to fit this tech to current day is like trying to send an email by carrier pigeon. It just won’t work.

I have claimed Bitcoin Diamond, Super Bitcoin, Bitcore as well as Bitcoin Gold and Cash. I still have Bitcoin World, Faith and others to go (cannot find an exchange as yet). 
They are easy to do using Bither and Bitpie on Android. Coinomi App is good as well. Remember to move all your BTC from the addresses as it needs your private keys - good chance to get a nice shiny segwit address :) 
Also you need to get on exchanges to do the trades. CoinmarketCap is your friend here. Again, look closely at the exchanges you use as some will only allow very low withdrawals and some will allow you to deposit only to then not let you withdraw unless you do a KYC. Go to the withdrawals page first to check. I have been caught in Bitfinex (of all places) with this. I just didn’t look before I sent any my account is locked. 
On Coinpanic, have you used them ? I looked yesterday but didn’t pull the trigger. 
Edit. For the curageous! 
A link to a list of forks with lots of details.

I just can’t believe this guy goes to his desk one day, logs in, gets his phone out, types in his 2FA sits back and rummages around learning how to use the exchange. There are logistics to this. He has to move the coins, he has to login, he needs to know how to use the exchange. When did he even register - In November there was a 3 week waiting list for verification. 
Or does he simply send an email to Kraken and get one of those guys to execute the trade. Did he hit up Jesse Powell on his 21.co page and ask him to pull the trigger. Surely Kraken (assuming they are handling the coins as a custodian) can advise how to liquidate these. What aren’t Circle involved or aware of this ? What about Grayscale, The W twins (they had a large stake in MtGox), Xapo. Did he use a dark pool, if so he needed help. An OTC business must have caught wind of this if this was executed. Surely there was a list discussed in some meeting of the top 3 ways to sell this qty if coin. There has to be more to this. 
I just cannot believe he simply logged into his exchange account where he held at the time of just first trade circa $1B (before the market crashed), proceeded to type random numbers and then finally typed 18,000 at a $6000 price and hit sell thinking this is the best way to do it. 
He could of got a better price but pushing it all though ShapeShift. I’m going to check to see if he is a mod of r/wallstreetbets as this is the only thing that could explain it.

It’s quite the irony that he insists on using middlemen (lawyers) while insisting everyone around him sign NDAs when as you said all he needs to do is sign an early block.

Marketcap seems fair at the moment all things considered. In a few years time it won’t tell the whole story (i.e. ERC20 tokens on top of ETH have value but are not represented in ETHs value, or are they? ) but good enough for now.

Bitcoin takes the path of most pain. That’s why this will last a few months so it can wring a few more hands out. Some may hodl on but others will lose their grip. 1 month is nothing, not even a payday. Let’s wait till the choice of keeping your btc stash at a loss really begin to burns.

You will always need to pay a miner fee to transact. As I understand it you will need to send to LB the 1 BTC + LB fee + miner fee (which you would have paid anyway). 
I don’t think any exchange will pay your transaction fees (or compensate you) on inbound transactions as they don’t know anything about your transaction (size etc). I know I said transaction way too many times here.

A comment made in the list was about the use of hazing and why it cannot do something ‘useful’. My view to counter this is that you need a neutral mining function that adds no value other than securing the network. If you suddenly had value in the hashing itself (other than securing the network) then chain splits (or orphaned blocks etc) could become problematic as people would continue to mine an invalid chain just to continue with solving whatever problem they were interested in solving (folding etc). That is not a good security model and broadens the attack surface for the network. 
Mining consumes electricity that no one else wants (which is why the electricity is cheap to begin with) and is otherwise going to waste. At the moment almost 100% of the energy consumed is turned into heat but as the ecosystem in mining matures you will see this heat being used for value added functions. One thing that immediately springs to mind is vertical farming or heat buildings. 
I see the waste at the moment is not the mining but our lack of imagination on how we use the output of that mining. Mining will bring a revolution in energy utilisation while empowering energy providers who have excess capacity.

I’m not sure you can. I sent a small amount of OmiseGo there and I cannot move this at all. No selling or withdrawing. I am not verified but have held the account for a few years. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:34:45
Thinking more on this. I don’t think the benefits would be seen in relative profitability or a drop in hash power. Perhaps the other way, an increase in hash power, relative to other mining farms and hence increased mining dominance. 
It could be seen indirectly by bitmain owning more of the hashing power than they could otherwise of afforded by virtue of having a reduced power bill. They can now afford to have (excluding all other costs) 15% more mining rigs in operation than they may otherwise have run. The more hashing power the more coins while profitability ratio of BTC:BCH stays the same.

Edit: 
Well guys. Ignore the below but I’m leaving up for others to see even though it’s embarrassing. 
This was my error in case you can’t spot it. I sent the btc to the wrong address as I did not check this and just pressed send. I am a fool. First time this has happened to me so a lesson well learned. 
Next, I then thought I must have missed a fee or something as the transaction seemed off. I then sent what I thought was a transaction fee again, to the same address to compensate. This did not work either. 
However, it does not end there. Somehow I sent both these transactions to an address I had in my clipboard and this happened to be my Breadwallet address (not the invoice address I thought I had copied). I do not know I made an error until I decided to just buy the last one and then found the funds in Breadwallet (to my amazement). I’m not sure how I made such a mistake (as I was diligent doing a c&amp;p) and come out ok after making this series of rookie mistakes. 
It ended well as I have since bought one of the last ones (using my btc in Breadwallet but this time by scanning the QR when placing the order from my laptop). Its all now confirmed and looking forward to it arriving. 
Note: This was all on an iPhone
Note 2: Coinbase commerce support were great even though it was not their end. Responded in less than 2 hrs. 
**Lesson**: Always check your outgoing address. I was very, very lucky. 
Well, thought I would just go for it and buy myself an early birthday present for a few days time. It did not go well. I just bought one, paid in btc and the Coinbase transaction timed out.

If the foundation fell towards Bitcoin Cash so easily then it is better to know this now rather than later. 
With this type of approach what you don’t breed is any loyalty or value. These people will flip-flop to whatever suits their whims next. This isn’t how you build a movement, it’s how you build a gang or mob. They will not create anything of meaning or long lasting.

There’s no such thing as Bitcoin Core coin. This is just a false narrative. Instead of being deceptive they should label themselves Bitcoin ABC. Their forked coin is called Bitcoin Cash (hence why logically it’s abbreviated to bcash) with a BCH ticker, and Bitcoin is just that, Bitcoin with a BTC ticker (as its been since 2008). 
Next they’ll be stating how Peter Wuille is the lead Bitcoin ABC code contributor since nearly 100% of the code base is copied from Bitcoin Core. 
The constant lies and misrepresentation coming from the Bitcoin ABC team is indefensible. It’s like having a doppelgänger following you around claiming to be you. We don’t get this issue with any other forked coin.

If you can hack any ERC20 token why chose this and why do an outrageous sum ? It doesn’t make sense. 
Edit: Guys it’s circa only a dozen relatively unknown tokens using a function that’s not even part of ERC20 standard. It was an add on piece of code that caused the problem. This is completely overblown with misleading title. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:59:35
I agree. I don’t think on principle this is ‘better’ than bitcoin but can see how this may come about. In a sense many ERC20 tokens are centralised, just held in a decentralised platform.

Because of your comment I invested more free funds into bitcoin and I’m going to spin up a LN node later tonight. 
I love the comparisons of bitcoin to stock or early dotcom ventures. They completely miss the point. 
Bitcoin is the internet of money. I’m not investing in something on top of the network, completely unrelated to the system. I’m investing in the network. I am buying an actual stake in the system. Show me how you can buy an actual stake in the internet itself and not just a business sat on top. 
The internet gained unimaginable value in 2009 when we first started to move value across it. Anyone that thinks the internet lost its value because stocks took a dive in the dotcom era, no way, it was the businesses on top that lost the value. The internet kept on growing and pushed into what it is today. This is the growth that Bitcoin will be replicating, not some stock price. 
Others can day trade and sell and short etc. I am completely aware of the value that bitcoin holds and because of this I’m keeping my bitcoin cold and dry. We haven’t even started yet.

You’re right. It is nearer 140k. But remember, it’s of both BCH and BTC so equivalent to 1/7 in BTC. Needless to say I think there are politics being played mainly due to holdings. These guys have a history together but from my understanding it was troubled due to investments in MtGox and how it was managed once MK bought it. I wonder if there were no coins involved if the same decision would be taken. Myself, I don’t think so. 
Edit: To add I think MK is trying his best to make amends and move on but with the possibility of future coins going his way he will have a lifetime of bad actors around him trying to sink what ever claws they can into him. We all have the luxury of anonymity, he does not.

@_date: 2018-04-07 10:38:31
I’m not sure. It doesn’t fit to the wider theme of Satoshi keeping him/herself completely private. 
Why would you then come out (over the last years as it has gained mainstream awareness) and start attending conferences, talking about bitcoin, interacting with the community, making blogs and posts etc. It’s just to close to confert as it would be too easy to make an error or accidentally reference a private email etc that then comes out a few years later and then bam, your ID’d. 
Satoshi certainly used 30 plus years of ground work and then as this was coming into focus within the space things will no doubt sound similar and characters today will be linked somehow from their train of thoughts. 
Overall, It all seems too clumsy for someone who spent a lot of time managing this risk knowing what was at stake. 
Interesting stuff though OP. It’s good to recognise everyone’s contribution to Bitcoin because no matter who wrote the code the concepts and principles are founded from layers of work built from many intelligent individuals.

And there is no such coin called Bitcoin Core. There is a coin called Bitcoin Cash which uses Bitcoin ABC as its reference implementation. This is part of the misdirection, trying to get people to believe that the ‘C’ of BTC means ‘core’. This gives them an angle to then claim that it’s the ‘B’ of the abbreviation that is the important bit. This slowly dilutes it’s meaning if not challenged and is important because the BTC ticker is something that bcash can never have (because they already have BCH). 
It’s like comparing apples and oranges, completely designed to confuse a layman.

It’s not often people in the UK get a chance to understand what it feels like to be denied access to their own money. Perhaps this will allow more to understand what it means when it’s said that money in a bank is just like an ‘IOU’ and not directly yours.

They’ve probable got a nice wad of cash still available from coins sold in Nov/Dec/Jan. Perhaps when this starts to run dry they’ll need to sell today’s coins. I think the miners are 6-9 months forward in their planning. Similar to how long the halving takes to have effect.

@_date: 2018-02-06 21:12:18
Healthy skepticism is great. 
My further thoughts: 
You won’t negotiate - a smart contract will. Constantly. On your behalf. To your defined parameters, of which you can change whenever you want. Other smart contracts will negotiate on other users behalf, or on behalf of a self owning taxi. It doesn’t really matter. The internet doesn’t know (or care) if you are a fridge or a person. The blockchain will ensure no value will change hands that is not correct (no one spends your coins) - no need for a trusted middleman in this process. 
Infrastructure is not free like you rightly say but nothing should stop you leveraging your data plan or being allowed to thether someone to your phone hotspot and charge a few quid for real-time access. There will be limits but then other networks will join in and challenge the status quo. The same could be said with real time car charging grids (set at traffic lights for instance in the road). Your car could pay/negotiate on your behalf for a quick charge while your at a red light. Why not ? Going to a petrol station is like queuing at a cash machine. It will be a crazy concept to the next generation. Just like we leave money in kitchen jars or behind the sofa or in a drawer we will be leaving money on cars wallets, on our fridge wallets, on our phones (breadwallet for instance), its only an address away. We will use the lightning network channels to do this instantly and for free. 
We need anonymous, non-reversible, and distributed because this is in part about establishing a mechanism of value transfer for the global community that cannot be frozen, stolen, traced or ‘lost’. In the West we have it easy. Our properties are legelly registered but in Haiti for example the local mayor or whatnot can just arrange to have your deeds lost and knock on your door and throw you out. A global, non editable record is needed to stop this (although they could just kick you out even if they didn’t have the deeds). That’s one old example but seems relevant. 
The internet was the freedom utopia. It just got hobbled along the way with strict access points (service providers). It has changed the face of communication forever though and given anyone the ability to have a voice. Bitcoin can be accessed by anyone at anytime with no permission needed and give anyone the ability to transfer value. I can send a bitcoin payment via ham radio or smoke signal if I needed (would take a bit if time). I can mine blocks by hand (not very fast !) and can instantly rejoin the network knowing that it is fully trust-less. 
Transferring value in this way is a layer the internet never had. Using a CC on the internet may work but is a band aid and rife with issues. It’s a 1960s invention pushed into an area that it won’t work on much longer unless we upgrade (and PayPal isn’t that upgrade). That’s why tech improvements in this area are so slow. That’s why only humans use them and we cannot assign them to robots on our behalf.
I look forward to seeing what comes next. It may be nothing or it may be something but at least there is the opportunity.

I have found no matter how much you tell people unless there has been a driving force to investigate then purchase bitcoin the idea is lost on them. I get why, but for me, I found bitcoin at a perfect time in my life and it matched my mode of thinking due to past circumstances. Others may not have had those past situations to then see the value of bitcoin. I was just fortunate that it was early on.

Terrible, terrible, terrible idea. I really hope this is a joke. I don’t think renaming this helps at all. What happens when someone buys Bitcoin Cash to use on their shiny Bitcoin Cash Lightning App. It really muddy’s the water. 
For anyone new this is super confusing. For anyone seasoned this is super confusing unless you’re in the know. Why add to this. Bitcoin Cash is a poor name anyway, there must be better ideas ?

Strange isn’t it. We are happy to take 60-70% swings over a 2% hit and the security that savings can bring, but work many times harder to get to the whole number of 1 BTC. Even though in your case it cost you 0.1 BTC extra across the trades, which is many times more than 2%. 
The psychology of bitcoin is pretty amazing.

To me this is where an establishment wants you to use their coin for reasons of monitoring or further data collection etc. This could be places like Casinos, Disneyland, Theme Parks, shopping centres or in game credits, Esports, Xbox to name a few ideas. Extend this to airmiles rewards or discount vouchers and so on. 
Not saying here that these are better than bitcoin but where a business may chose to use an Alt for their own interests (they would still accept bitcoin for these alts). One would assume an instant cross chain swap is available. 
Note: It seems to be we are moving into a time where we can classify store of value coins, platform coins to that of utility tokens.

Agreed. That’s what I did for Bcash, Btcgold and Btcdiamond. Unless they just went and shared their private keys and didn’t move the coin (or held in an accommodating wallet etc). 
Also, if the same people weren’t moving coins the % of total coins they held in proportion to the total would shrink over time. We are seeing above that the % if total coins being held is increasing.

Yeah. Felt bad for the them as only wanted to explore the space. Tried several things but the only way they got it was when I compared it to buying a gift card for Amazon and trying to spend it at the Apple App Store (bad analogy but for a complete layman it helped categorise). They did not realise there were separate ecosystems etc.
