Yes. I am judging it on principle. It's a philosophical question. Sort of like nuclear energy, is it good or bad? On one hand we get nukes, and on the other, nuclear power plants. Same here, they hardforked because of the failure of ETH's first major project. On one hand, everyone got their money back and idk what happened to the price but like you said 5%, no biggie. On the other hand, they set a dangerous precedent on the fungibility of ETH and the integrity of the system that allowed them to rollback the stupidity and recklessness that lost people their money. The very people who got themselves into the mess voted to engage a hardfork to return their money. As you can see, many don't agree with this line of thinking. It's the same line of thinking that pissed people off about the bailouts of 2008. Who do you think own shares of the federal reserve who bailed out the banks? google it. If this doesnt sound ethically murky to you, idk what to say. But hey, vitalik said that was the last one right?

lets pick apart your shitty argument for the 3rd time.


what was brilliant. Please read and reread my statements.


again, this doesn't invalidate anything I said about moral hazard. Do you know how to read? The "community consensus" was that they made a stupid irresponsible mistake and wanted their money back, and they voted for that. Doesn't make them right you idiot.


time frame is irrelevant, my example was to show the possible path the bitcoin community could have taken and yet didn't. The same path that ETH did take. Unfortunately.

....saying "it's just consensus though dude" doesnt negate anything I just said about moral hazard of the investors voting their own money back. 


I think people too quickly forget that Ethereum is 12 months old.
We don't forget. But you guys seem to. It's the same arrogance that made people invest how much into DAO?


It really is. Big banks made stupid bets. They own the federal reserve. The fed bails them out. Sure, it wasn't that simple, but the symmetry of the situations are almost identical. But okay sure, lets say it's not comparable. I'll use another example.
Remember mt. gox? Thousands lost everything they had. IT was the largest debacle for bitcoin at the time, resulting in widespread turmoil in the community, similar to DAO. If we had rolled back the losses of the investors, we would have saved the day (hard forked to an earlier time maybe). But at what cost? We would have proved that bitcoins are no longer fungible, and that the crowd, not the code is law. And if that the is the case, why even be into crypto at all?

Very true, you're talking about the volatility. Of course people need to have faith that their money won't rise or drop 20% or whatnot over the short term. Stability will come in time, as the market cap increases. There are many reasons why Bitcoin can and will be a lifeline in another financial crisis, or currency crisis, (both, all of the above, and more really). It's an entire new asset class, back by faith in it's strength rather than in the machinations of a political and financial elite.

Bitcoin is fairly antifragile but it has to be proven first, trusted, and trust takes time. Bitcoin is a diamond in a pig trough right now, we know that, but you know how diamonds are formed don't you; under intense heat and pressure.  In due time man, have faith.

HAHA Don't tell me you believed those lines by the heads of state and the financial figureheads. They scared the shit out of the guys who they were begging for bailouts from, by telling them that there would be a revolution tomorrow morning if they didn't get bailed out.  And yes that is true. That's why they did it. If they had a way to let the banks die and everyone would be okay, they would've done that, but hank paulson didn't exactly put it like that did he...


No I did not, the loans would still be in USD/EURO/RMB. Sigh....

Why did he seem extremely interested in gaining favor with the younger (impressionable) entrants to the community? Idk but he was definitely a bad actor that is gone now, and good riddance.

So basically you're whining further on how there's extra work for wallet providers. But if your house really was burning down, how much "proactive willingness" do you have to start throwing buckets of water on it? If there is a *real* problem, I don't think "proactive willingness" will be in short supply. That is if there is a real problem and  it's not coinbase being stingy about upcoming fees for transactions. Lawl.
Disregarding all of that, your solution sounds almost too good to be true. So no problems with a contentious 2mb hard fork, that we'll probably have to do again some (short) time down the road then aye? Please.


Then his point is wrong, shortsighted, and unintelligent. What's the worse that can happen, fees become very high for the people that need their transactions processed NOW-and how many is that? If you got into bitcoin to buy your morning coffee with I don't know what to tell you. Also, segwit solves many of the resource bottlenecks, data to the UTXO set rather than signature data, etc. These changes had to happen anyway in the long run. In addition, speaking of in the long run, you think segwit won't be useful when the block size limit increases? And yes we all agree it will increase.
Then after segwit rolls out the core devs have a little breathing room to work on yes, a blocksize limit increase that is more than "good enough", not some half assed, 75%, must-have-it-now VC driven hard fork. 
Segwit even buys time for the implementation of the lightning network which solves almost all of the problems you people are whining about. On a side note I've personally, (and most non sockpuppet "people"), have not had any problems with transactions clearing on time.

I love his derisive attitude lawl. Still trying to fit bitcoin into a square hole. The tone will change soon enough. Bitcoin isn't a horseless carriage, it's a fucking spaceship. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible crypto gold used in a massive decentralized settlement system-the first of it's kind. Stop trying to fit the old definitions and welcome yourself into this brave new world. 


He completely misses the reason, point, and importance of speculators and holders of *digital gold*. If only he had done his research. The theory is that massive increases in value will lower volatility over time, as we've seen so far but I guess only time will tell who is right.

Lol. Although you're only an investment banker but you do know how loans are created right? You do know how much money they make? You do know that if the bitcoin "commodity" that you traded becomes more widespread, and used as a currency, they lose a lot of that revenue? This isn't only the banks, its all the current payment processors. And this is only one of the reasons. I would be scared, if I was them.
Bitcoin is traded worldwide, so not just dollars, and how strong do you think the world's currencies will be down the line?
Not a shit post huh, what is the great fear? Idk man, why did 42 banks suddenly band together in a consortium? Dunno man, probably nothing though.

Surgeon Y brushes him out of the way and makes him great again. They re-evaluate and continue to make him the hulk. And the mission continues.

LOL, and the point about if not everyone switching over for the hard fork creating problems?
Also, I don't want to present this as an argument because I'm still searching for it but they have said that they have data showing anything over 3MB to be a problem. I haven't found this yet, but I assume you know what they're talking about? Can you point me to their data?


Um, no if you want to go back and read carefully, I've genuinely just wanted to find the reasons why, pros and cons of both sides. In fact people have pm-ed me and I've had good enlightening conversations. And no, I think the parties involved are all very intelligent, but that core is playing a defensive role. They don't want to hard fork as there are dangers involved- so they are trying a method where there is less danger, yet still solving the problem. You're the one seemingly just going for the snark points. 
Bruh, listen, no one likes assholes.

Please explain how these bitcoins are destroyed. People just smashing their trezors? What, why? As long as the code is sound, why couldn't/wouldn't people use bitcoin?


You are still comparing bitcoin to fiat when I have clearly stated to you that it is more comparable to gold. Why do you insist on arguing straw-man arguments?


Oh please, and the kool-aid you've been drinking since private school shines through as well.


Like I said, it will survive for many other reasons than those, and like I said, no one thinks it will REPLACE fiat completely. It is more like gold. But yes we do believe it will be used more than fiat if it becomes popular, in which case the value of one bitcoin will rise dramatically. How many times do I have to repeat this? Do you read?


Um..."In its broadest sense, monetary policy includes all actions of governments, central banks, and other public authorities that influence the quantity of money and bank credit."...So very educated idiot, you're saying that those decisions that the political and financial elite make have NO BEARING on the decisions/changes that ordinary people have to make regarding their financial affairs? Even if they don't agree with those decisions? Seriously? Let me ask you a question, for what reason has inequality gone up after the bailouts and QE? Who has it benefited most, why? Answer that one.


LOL ohreally, well that is very strange because I was under the impression that many countries around the world were engaging in "competitive currency devaluations" to boost exports and whatnot. Just the euro huh. Also, you didn't reply to "volatility in capitalist financial systems. To answer your unspoken question, no capitalism is not a system that is working any longer. This is where your **AGE/crystallized knowledge** shows. 


Uh...I mean the same shit will still apply, bitcoin will just clear up a lot of the middlemen, the pervasive control. You're reading the words but not understanding...you're still just trying to poke holes in the concept. I'm trying to tell you that the concept is sound. Bitcoin is already doing wha tit was meant to do. It will go further still. 
**TL;DR: You are old and entrenched in the system yet still willing to engage. Good. Calling me young repeatedly doesn't really do much, but making straw man arguments does make you look at the very least terribly desperate. Your knowledge (extensive as it may be) on fundamental concepts needs major reorganization. Last but not least, the "system" that you love so much that is working for you, is filled with remarkably well read and intelligent men and women-agreed. They have shown me that the system can be changed. It would be wise to listen to their doubts, but disagree with what they say cannot be done. Here is some homework. Read the bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto. Then read it again.**

Bitcoin is a new asset class that is comparable to gold, albeit digital. However, it also has many attributes that make it a currency. It is in it's own asset class, since with stocks you own a share of a company and it's profit/worth, but with BTC you're basically buying a part of a decentralized network. So if you think BTC and its blockchain will be popular-and there are a host of reasons why, then you could buy a piece of the network itself. Pretty cool
Lol oh right so to answer your question, bitcoin is traded like the FX market, most of the major traded currencies along with gold and altcoins can be exchanged for bitcoin. So if the value of say the USD decreases or you think it will due to hyperinflation or if there is a loss of trust in fiat currencies, the value of BTC would go up due to bitcoin being basically a decentralized currency/gold asset that is governed by mathematics and not fallible human beings engaging in political and economic shenanigans. That's one popular reason many invest in bitcoin, among many others. Of course there are a variety of factors affecting it's price, and bitcoin could fail as technically it is still an experiment. Keep an eye out on the current block size debates and whatnot. As with all financial decisions, you should do your research and come to your own conclusions. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose is the usual line I'm supposed to throw out.
Hope this helped.

liquidity and volatility is a chicken/egg problem but it is not insurmountable. It just takes a few large waves of investors.

For the past year, discussion and research about the risk-reward of hard forking the network in its current state has taken place. The technical consensus is that hard forks as prescribed by alternative scalability proposals should only be considered if absolutely necessary. This same consensus of Bitcoin developers has determined that this absolute necessity condition is unmet given the current state of the network. Yet, human short-sightedness and drives to resolve uncertainty continue to fuel support of the quick fixes, which may put the long-term future of the project at major and truly needless risk."

He's making a mistake though, he's putting his bet on wallstreet, building a system that is losing social trust with every bailout and financial crisis? Well good luck buddy, you ready for this one that's hitting right now? You know your friends aren't going to look too good when they're taking taxpayer's money and screwing over the public right?

You're telling me that switching to a currency that can't be manipulated by cabals of the political and financial elite won't solve these issues? Sure some of the benefits that commercial bank accounts provide are great...for the statistical few that can afford them, otherwise they're fairly predatory. Also, Coinbase and/or other bitcoin network companies can provide almost all of the services you talked about, in time, and with proper regulation and development. You just have a lack of imagination. It was always that way and it will always be that way. Please, man, you're getting old.

Um, he's explaining that they are split in two for the wrong reasons. And he's not making economic decisions, but technical ones. He's making sure bitcoin stays true to it's mission.




You're the one trying to make economic arguments. Such standard projection, it's sad.

Well, I hate to tell you this but it really sounds like there might be, if that happens. Anyway the hard fork if it happens will come after segwit, which is in testing already. Not a bad move I don't think, to just see how it goes? You're right in that it does make Bitcoin more complex and confusing at first but it's likely that you're going to figure out which companies/wallets support RBF pretty quickly, I mean, idk about you but I tend to use the same services.

nah, that's something else entire, he's definitely psychopathic. I had to look it up
Psychopaths display different traits depending on their disorder, but common signs include superficial charm, a grandiose notion of self-worth, the need for stimulation and impulsiveness, pathological lying, the ability to manipulate others and a lack of remorse and empathy.
while sociopath:
Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of regard for the moral or legal standards in the local culture. There is a marked inability to get along with others or abide by societal rules. Individuals with this disorder are sometimes called psychopaths or sociopaths.

"Water. Shelter. We must tend to the wounded. We'll need to seek out and collect raw resources, and form teams for construction."
What is the shelter, who are the wounded, what does the raw material represent?

@_date: 2016-01-29 17:47:00


He is trying to make it the best store of value. WHAT? Yes you are right? lol


Uh yeah there are economic **consequences**, that bitcoin is stronger than ever with segwit? But he's still only making technical **decisions**. IE he has his eye on the true worth of the network.


"In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."
To reiterate, the systemn is secure as long as honest nodes colectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. Now, let me ask you a question, what happens to the node count if we raise the blocksize right now. How secure is the system then. 
Evidently, you only read the title. So yeah, clearly you're right. We don't share the same mission. Go apply for your chase freedom today, no annual fee! And get out of here.


lol you want cheap transactions, use a VISA credit card or wait for lightning, shit it's pretty cheap to transact in bitcoin as of right now. No one is and no one will be prevented form using bitcoin with segwit...What the hell are you talking about?


Wow still, more projection. People want a safe [effective] blocksize increase, and they are providing exactly that! Do you even know why bitcoin is valuable, and therefore popular?
Do you even think?

EL OH EL. Oh god, you are a product of the system in every way. In it's purest form. A true believer. Very cute.


 
The lender of last resort is a concept that only comes into play in fractional reserve lending, when a bank irresponsibly lends excessive currency into existence. 
As for the deflation "problem", see here [look! he's you, but he actually did his homework!](
I do not want to argue this point because it is arguing Austrian economics vs your (very obviously) keynesian school of thought. You really want to do this? I don't. Because it really could go on all day and I've got better things to do. Honestly. We'll agree to disagree on this point and just wager our intelligence on bitcoin's survival, yeah? Where's that remind me in 10 years bot?


Haha there you go again spouting nonsense that you didn't even have the originality to think up on your own. Much less think about critically. The BOE said it, didn't they. Listen I never said, and go back and read my posts carefully, that bitcoin would replace all fiat. More likely, if bitcoin becomes widespread, it will be a sort of reserve currency. You'll still pay your taxes in (inflated) USD. lol, have no fear. I said that bitcoin will replace the BANKS and PAYMENT PROCESSORS, and the like. Please, reading comprehension.


Do I know that mortgage/asset backed securities are just financial products that are actually genius in that they provide lower costs of capital to lenders, can lead to higher economic growth and gives a broader distribution of risk to investors? Yes I do. Do capitalists use these products to con the lowest rungs of the financial pyramid for their own gain, time after time, getting away with merely a slap on the wrist? This, I also know to be true. 
Please don't associate us with the mass that was Occupy Wallstreet. I get the feeling you were one of the suits looking down into that unruly, young, idealistic, disorganized, and yes, rather naive, mob. Bitcoin has highly sophisticated roots, rooted in the same boiling frustration perhaps, but much more organized. Focused. So yes my idiotic troglodyte, I know both sides of the story. I was merely pointing out that anger at the system, fresh from the last crisis, still runs deep in this community, so perhaps you had better keep that shit quiet. savvy?


Thank you for the first part. I do try. And I believe it is you that is fundamentally dense to the truths around you. I bet that when you look at bitcoin, when you read about it-if you even do, you harbor some rather unpalatable feelings that you can't understand. You know what that's called? Denial. But then again, I highly doubt you read ANYTHING on bitcoin seeing as we're having this conversation.


Bitcoin was created because there was the notion that not everyone benefits from or agrees with centralized planning of the economy. With centralized control over our own value.


The argument of age is used when one confuses the lack of experience with a lack of knowledge. Where does the house of cards come in? Oh buddy. You people never learn do you. I want to ask if you're a paid shill but sheep like you don't even need paying.


Oh you know who created bitcoin do you? Oh boy, are you delusional. In the last crisis the central banks were th elenders of last resort, who will play that role in the next crisis? the IMF? Then after the next crisis? Yes bitcoin is a terribly unstable store of value and only a speculative commodity at this point. But with next generation financial systems and networks being built around it, and the devaluations in currency around the world, not to mention volatility in the capitalist financial system... Time is on our side, not yours. Time is a great ally and a terrible enemy.
Interest policy provisions...lol you mean Article 9?
Still thinking like "how will this revolutionary new network fit into the old one? It can't! So it's gonna fail!"
I'm sure the internet did the same, didn't it. Oh wait.
Keep drinking the kool-aid, the only thing you've ever known. I pity you and people like you.

XT was trying to be pushed through rather hastily. Too fast in fact, for many in the community. I supported XT and even I was hesitant because of how they did it. I was also a bit overwhelmed by the reaction of the community. Everyone just went nuts, chose sides, went hardcore blue vs red. 
Chillax, we're on the same side, and we're all searching for the best options. We're also all human and therefore, fallible. Yesterday I didn't know something that I now understand and so my opinions change.

Everyone likes attention, all the eyes in the room on them, women more so for obvious reasons.

No you fucking idiot, but you think he created a deflationary currency with attributes exactly like a DIGITAL GOLD so that we could use it like a credit card as you suggested? My god why yes, yes are you the imbecile here.


No gold is meant to store value, and of course gold can't be sent instantly so that is not the intent. You're really trying hard here aren't you. Don't hurt yourself. Dumb fuck. Also have you even bought and stored gold before? Clearly you haven't. It's fucking expensive.




"Yes. Have you?"
Yes, of course. If everyone just dumps it every time they get it, its value will go to zero. If someone sits on it, even for a second, the collective amount being sat on for that second removes the supply from the market and gives it value (why bitcoin can still be valuable even if it's only used as a transaction mechanism). But if everyone sits on their gold and doesn't trade it, then how do you know what the price is? Let's pretend everyone decided to sit on their bitcoin right now. No trading. How do you believe its price will go up from $750?
Sorry if what I'm saying is so complicated you have trouble understanding it, and it seems as if I'm not making sence. Try thinking about it first. It helps.
Wow you really don't know basic principles. You just undermined your own argument then twirled it into nonsensical garbage. Please, stop. This is painful to read, and I'm not even going to bother replying to the shit you just wrote.  
You're clearly trying very hard to save face and not look stupid but it's very goddamn apparent that you lack the brain cells. Also you spelled sense wrong. Please look in the mirror and reevaluate. Dear god.

Are you one of them imbeciles that didn't get past the title of the white paper? Don't answer that question imbecile it was rhetorical, you missed the part where he describes how the system works. Here it is fucktard. 
"...The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. "
-satoshi nakamoto
Oh and you can send gold over the internet instantly and securely? I didn't know that. Also, have you tried to buy, stash, and hold 20 million dollars worth of gold? Easy huh.
And yes transactions can be tracked. What are you a newb or something?


Oh really? You really think that? Ever read up on basic monetary principles? Do you understand that if no one "sits on the gold" then the gold is worthless? Fucking idiot, do you even understand what you're saying?
Please, just stop. You're making a fool of yourself. I can tear your meaningless drivel to pieces all day.

Sigh. 
You think if the IRS sees bitcoin gone from your account and they see a "sell" on the transaction, they're gonna go "hmm well maybe he just sent it into another wallet that he controls"? 
Essentially you're saying that as a default, you're not exactly reporting that we're selling when we transfer but you're going to make us guilty until proven innocent in their eyes. And you believe that this is the right thing to do? C'mon now.

Well the future sure as shit ain't fiat currencies, I can tell you that much. Lol, what an inopportune time to write an article like this, the price is about to hit a bear trap then shoot up.
Do you not understand the problems coinbase is dealing with and circle is trying to avoid? Two words, regulatory costs. coinbase is gonna get slapped with all sorts of legal fees dealing with this IRS thing, and that's not even including the regular ole' KYC stuff.
Circle is a young company, and so are all the companies working with bitcoin. They don't want to seem like weaksauce rats jumping ship, but as CEOs and whatnot, I'm betting that sometimes they have to do a distasteful pivot to save their companies. (Use coinbase allowing ether trading for example, back when volume was shooting through the roof and the price and volume of BTC was lower, they just needed a part of that for their cash flow. This was obvious.) For circle, I'm guessing the 1% fee for buying bitcoin didn't make up for the regulatory costs of doing that and holding the coins. So a simple risk/reward calculation, and there you have it. Nothing to get worked up about. Everybody chillax and enjoy the ride.

No, like I said to another commenter, 


I'm merely pointing out that this list and these companies are legitimately copping out/supporting a misguided and deeply flawed proposal. These businesses have done so much for the community, but as such, they do have a voice and a part to play in the debate. To deny that is just silly. To say "hey I'm just here to make a living, you guys fight this out" is just irresponsible. I don't wish to hate anyone, I'll only hate the actions they have taken. Read his twitter posts. Can you really tell me that we're the ones being antagonistic? The man is extremely one-sided and confrontational, and a fair bit of a demagogue. The whole thing is an assault on the stability of the community. We're playing defense here, make no mistake about that.

Do you know how many **citizens** in the US don't have bank accounts? And that is just citizens. If they tried this overnight, the economy would collapse. Do you know what they're afraid of more than the economy collapsing? Revolution. And that will happen if enough people do not have the means to get the goods and services they need to survive, so regardless, the use of [illegal] cash and bitcoin will still be allowed. They'll have no choice but to let it slide. Shit, do you know what that sort of attention will do to the price of bitcoin? It'll be the dark side of the moon, but it'll still be a moon landing.

@_date: 2016-02-01 22:50:06
I would too. u/nullc provided core's logic, which was grounded in very fine reasoning. I have read and seen classic supporter's and their logic is basically "the code is 500 lines and so complicated", "rbf fee market oh no". "So what the node count is reduced, just a little more centralization", "hard forking is no big deal-we should hard fork all the time". All wrong, delusional, irrational. They're like a pack of raving mad impulsive lunatics itching to just dive off the cliff and see what happens. If this hard fork succeeds, the experiment will take a bad turn.
It simply takes a bit more thinking to see why core is right in waiting, why it's wise to delay the hard fork until a later date when we're all prepared, why segwit can and will solve our current blockchain limit problem. Just a little more thinking. But people would rather take the shortcut because thinking hurts. If you want to go and read r/btc, you'll see the general lack of intelligence over there. It's fucking sad the illogical unthinking shit they type, so sad I honestly debated whether or not someone created bots for a "classic" army, but their usernames are actual words so...
I get the feeling it's the leftovers of Mike Hearn's supporters. The younger more impressionable crowd that he attracted. Mostly newcomers to the community, they understand very little, and tend to voice their support for whatever solution seems easiest. Then we have the coinbase and wallet guys who obviously don't want any complications from rbf-they just want to be the next VISA. Add to this the seemingly human inability to just admit that you're fucking wrong, when one is so publicly entrenched in a position. Plain old human weakness on their parts, we were always the weakest link...Sometimes I can't wait until the AIs take over.

Easy mistake to make, I wonder if he's done the self reflection to even begin to see that. I doubt it.
And even if he saw it for a moment, I'm pretty sure the denial and ego would kick in. In fact I'm pretty sure that's why he wrote this article, to reminisce about past glories, waving them in the air as if to prove his genius.

"...On the other hand, if the hard fork is implemented, the ethereum blockchain, which is supposed to be an unchangeable record of all transactions, will no longer be seen as immutable. In sense, code may no longer be law."

@_date: 2016-07-19 23:58:52
Lawl, you explain to me? please don't flatter yourself and we wouldn't rollback the mtgox hack, technically we could do a hardfork to rollback the damage it caused to investors btc holdings. Which is what ETH did. It's game over for them.
It's funny that you keep talking about ETH holders (the guys implementing the hard fork) doing what's more profitable for them marketwise, despite giving up any credibility that they might have had. Sounds exactly like a shitcoin by definition. And no, gathering market price is not the "whole point" of cryptocurrencies you fucking imbecile, go home. Did you honestly just say that?
ETH did shoot itself in the leg, and now it wants to go back in time and fix it. No can do. Deal with it, let it heal. OR admit that you're a shitcoin. Just admit it. It's the first step.
