Looks nice!! We have a special issue coming where we will toy with a similar concept. Send me a pm with your email and I will let you know when it is out.

Ooooh. They got Dish to join. Nice. I saw [Kyle Torpey's tweet]( and thought they made the jump on their own.

Congrats everyone. I definitely used most of the suggestions mentioned here to pitch ideas to our writers. If you shared an idea here please send me your name if you want to be mentioned in the credits or else I will use your username.
Winners, pm me your public address!

I said it in person, but I want to thank you again for opening up EVR to the Inside Bitcoin NYC attendees a year ago. It is a beautiful club.

bitWallet is very nice but I don't like how they flash your private key when you first make a wallet.

I am totally agreeing with you here. I like Bitcoin related projects or any platform built on Bitcoin. But I expect other schools of thought can teach us things without having to learn on the most valuable blockchain.
You shouldn't stop caring though. The fact that you saw articles on NXT or other altcoins means that our process was pretty open. We let our writers explore pretty much anything.

This is good, but I will make a note to only include hardware that can ship at the time the story is written (no presales).

Where is this reference from?

Hmm. The closest thing I can think of is [this post]( from Joel Dietz. But he just talks about his project. 
I think you are talking about walking through the history of investment vehicles with kickstarter-style crowdfunding being the 2nd to last development, and crypto-assets being the latest development. Please let me know if I misunderstood you.

The goal of the issue is to introduce reddit to folks who may not know about it, and explore the connection between reddit.comand the Bitcoin community. There will be other articles based on the ideas mentioned here as well.
There will be an article about the "tipping culture" here, but what you are hinting at should be 2 separate articles: 
1) The Jaded Bitcoin User 
2) The Bitcoin Subreddit Sidebar.

Same exact thing happened to me. They said I was the first to ask, but that they don't expect to implement any services related to Bitcoin.
I figure convincing a restaurant with a lot of traffic to get an ATM (or getting it for them) may be better than waiting for the credit union.

He has posted on the site a lot less, but he hasn't technically left. He still does occasional posts if you check [his page]( out.

Hey folks. It is Ruben. I'm sure you want proof...

I'll sign this now.
The message in this post is totally legit. But I haven't made an official public announcement since the deliberations going on could change course and totally invalidate this thread. 
I have, however, been asked to say more.
The reason why I started writing with the magazine last year had to do with being able to experience a currency I loved in a format I loved. I already subscribe to the New Yorker + some other mags. It was a nice mix of the future and the past.
Those who share this desire represent an intelligent and forward thinking community. And the investors deliberating now know this community still exists. There is a chance that the magazine could be resurrected at some point in the future.
There has also been a demand for a newer model where a publication could better mimic the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. I would love to see this happen.
Both scenarious.... resurrected magazine or other decentralized publications... have merit and I am hopeful that more aspects of things we enjoy get more decentralized whenever that makes sense (nod to Adam and his [LTBcoin](
I'll try to answer questions I see in the comments + respond now then I have to get back to thanksgiving prep.
Thank you.

There are several backups in place for this content and I ran wget on the site recently. Another solution built into wordpress (updraftplus.com) was also recommended and I'll share that with the webmaster.
Quite the researcher! Do you want to write for Bitcoin Magazine? ;) 
very good point. We were one of the few Bitcoin based sites that paid out in Bitcoin on a consistent basis. I have heard complaints of other sites that don't. 
If you are dissing the mag... ouch! 
I got Issue  too. I need to fill up my set though. I think one of the early issues is out of print.
Such a hustler!
I am 99.99% sure BFL issues are unrelated to the investor discussions.
and one more for now...
I kinda like your username.
