1. Make a Coinbase account and get it verified
2. Link it to your bank and deposit money
3. Send the USD to GDAX
4. Buy your Bitcoin
5. Set a sell order at 15-20% of the price you bought at

Well, it will be.

This, 100%.
Most times a new coin is listed on an exchange it fluctuates WILDLY. Just look through Bittrex or something and rewind to the first 30 minutes of a lot of the coins on there. Similar stories.
Whether or not this was case of insider trading is up for debate, but stuff like this is innate to the ecosystem.
The only thing that makes this different is the general public has been exposed to what a pump and dump is.
Stuck with BCH you bought for 9k? Maybe don't buy at 3x the market rate next time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:22:44
It’s corrected over 30% 5 times this year though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:05

But begging isn't a good look.

@_date: 2017-02-22 21:09:37
And to think I was going to wait until it dipped below 800 to buy my first coin.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:06:04

You have no idea how bitcoins work. You can buy them on exchanges. You don’t need to mine them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:55:17
I remember having this conversation with someone 3 weeks ago :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:53:48
I remember reading posts like this at 1k lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:55:53
But you can buy them in sizes as small as .00000001
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:48
Lmao. Go look at an order book and look how many bitcoins are sold a second.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:41
Aggregate of many exchanges with tens of thousands of users.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:54
You exchange it for usd it takes 2 seconds
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:58:05
Wow very wise post thank you
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:43:40
I’ve seen this same post in different variants all year long.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:25:51
He was quoting DBZ
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:54:50

My wallet is thanking me. Bitcoin funded my two week vacation oversees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:48
You and everybody else said the same thing at 250 and 1000
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:24
Use GDAX for no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:47:59
I don’t need good luck I already got the money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:34
He’s trying to pretend he knows something you don’t. He would have said the same thing last year when it hit 1k, lol.
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:49:56
What are time zones???
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:15:17
It shows returns, not actual price. Somebody is making the same return from $1 to $2 as somebody from $100 to $200. Think about it. It’s useful to see those distances as the same amount of space.
