Congrants man. I'm in the same boat.  Lost my job a few months ago due to corporate takeover.  And I just don't give a chit.  I'm about to let my "Professional license" expire, which took me 8 years of college to obtain.  Cheers!

I'm wondering how some people are given such good service and I received such crappy service?  Coinbase was my entry into Bitcoin world.  They seemed ok in the beginning, but I had to ditch them about 8 months later. The main problem I had with Coinbase is with erratic daily limit changes.  My daily limit was decreased over several months to such a low $ amount that it was unusable.  Then all of a sudden, the limit was dramatically increased.  All with no reason given.  Just erratic. Even my friend's account was closed without any reason given.  I've since stopped all trading with Coinbase and went with Gemini. Gemini was straight forward. No BS. All rules were up front and I understood them.  So far, no problems with Gemini at all.

i'd go ~2/3 in now.  Saving the 1/3 for unforeseen events.  I buy when things are calm OR there's panic selling.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:31:30
If I understand what's happening correctly, Coinbase is decluttering their wallets at the customer's expense?  It's costing me up to 2% in network costs to move them out of Coinbase.  0.40 network fee for $20 transfer out. That's unacceptable.  I'm still wondering the reasoning behind the massive limit increase in my account?   But it's a little too late. I've already moved most of my transactions to Gemini, which so far has not given me any problems.

When I set up my trezor, it had an option to enter a password or phrase for my seed. I can't remember exactly, but i think it was required if I had more than 1 wallet on the Trezor.  So when I log in, I have to 1st enter the 9 digit pin, then the Password phrase twice before my wallets show up.

$500 limit/day ACH.  I've been depositing fairly regularly.  The other day they raised it to $2500/day ACH.  I think once they kinda of know that you're a valued customer and not a shady crook, they raise the limits. Gemini has been just awesome so far.
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:09:51
Michael-Coinbase, Why the sudden increase in my limits to $10000/day?  For the longest time my account limits were dwindled away without any reason given?  It was at $100/day for a while now. Nothing has changed on my acct.  I didn't even send you guys my Driver License info.  
So if I purchase $10000 worth, is my input wallet going to be 500+ input wallets to transfer out?  Looks to me that you guys have ~$2 or so in each wallet.  This is terrible for fees and for cluttering up blocks.

This is actually amazing.  I tried to convince a lot of people, but only 1 took the bait.  Now he can't wait to convert fiat to BTC and other crypto.  But everyone else is so NOT interested and even angered by me peddling funny money.  They think I have something to gain by all this.  hahahaha.
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:44:46
Gemini just keeps getting better.  Never gave me 1 problem yet. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:46:27
i use SunTrust.  Wired over 6 figures to Gemini this week. No prob.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:40:09
This happened to my Chase card also several months ago. The funds are coming out of my checking acct, but I assume they check the Credit card to back up the checking acct?  Coinbase removed Chase card and instant buy was crippled for some time. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 17:09:21
Gemini.com supports Japan as well as South Korea
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:33:04
So this crap isn't about scaling at all?!  Exactly what I suspected.  We need to cut this cancer out of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:55:27
The market is speaking. BCU is 1/3 the price of BCC on bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:12:43
I think Satoshi prefers decentralization. BU isn't it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:16:50
yes.  The current BTC is unforked.  As long as u have the current BTC, when it forks, you'll have 2 separate coins- BTC and BTU.  And if these 2 chains ever fork again, you'll have coins on those chains also.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:09:34
My thoughts exactly.  hahaha.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:49:17
i was pondering on forked BTC BTU.  My initial thinking was that BTC BTU combined price will drop steeply.  But I could be wrong.  I see another scenario where BTC is heavily bought driving up prices in anticipation of a FORK and coins on both chains.  In any case. I think we need to load up on unforked BTC.  This will guarantee coins on all future chains.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:19:48
"some" punishment?  I want a total beating.  haha
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:28:54
The charts look oversold also. I've been buying.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:03:36
You go wipe your shit and start buying BCU at Bitfinex.  It's fallen below $200.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:43:32
I'm not too smart either. hahaha.  But, I don't see how we can scale to accommodate the masses by increasing the block size.  The only path forward seems with segwit implementation. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:30:41
1 BTC will = 1 BTC &amp; 1 BTU after the fork.  I have a hunch that both chains will survive in the short term.  Trades on the exchanges will be wild and crazy.  But BTC with Core, I think will pull ahead in future developments.  There is absolutely no way to Scale On-Chain that BU is proposing.  This really isn't about scaling, but hostile take over. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:35:44
Because this fight isn't about scaling.  
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:21:17
One  has to take chances in life to make money.  I went in 80% into crypto, mostly BTC.  I don't see any other endeavor for me with better risk/reward ratio.  Now is a great time to get in. Don't wait until it breaks over $1300. Second stage rockets will ignite.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:53:47
You're right.  The true market will speak once it forks.  BCU will be at 1/100 of BCC as soon as segwit gets activated and 2nd layer solutions come on line.  Scaling debate will be over.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:41:53
Don't even bother bro.  Nothing from this slime's mouth is believable. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:53:31
Segwit is big enough for now.  You don't want the shoes to be flopping around his feet do you?
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:16:32
Good analysis!
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:59:54
I will be boycotting!
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:16:38
Thank you Core Developers!  Most of my crypto is in BTC.
Now I need to find out what'll happen to my 10,000 DAO tokens?  Hahahaha.
@_date: 2016-06-30 06:18:33
This amount of BTC is not really that much.  It'll get bought up really fast, imo.  What happens when demand is greater than the supply? Does it do what GBTC is doing? Trading at a premium.  Or is the price locked into BTC price?
@_date: 2016-06-03 06:00:32
phuck coinbase!
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:01:43
Thank you Core Team!!!
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:18:32
Good luck BCH. I will be dumping, so BCH believers can buy cheap.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:18:47
I don't think miners will drop out if the price stays above $600 level. Miners also know BTC will eventually go up.  I think they may even crank it up even more for future rewards. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:55:04
Exactly.  Only the rich get richer in the name of protecting the little people.
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:19:56
My questions exactly. Also, if bread wallet is never online and funds are sent to the receiving address, would it show up correctly on the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:06:02
I've not looked too much into Litecoin, but I like their position on this issue. $1000 going into Litecoins.  hahahahah..

I need my BCash confirmed at Bittrex.  Where is that pucker Jihan that wanted this coin?  He should be directing his mining power at this chit just on principle.  They got what they want, but then don't want it. What the puck is all this about?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:40:39
Ditto.  I thought changes have to be made with BIP.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:31:10
I'm just happy for him. BTCC?  WHahahahaha!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:35:22
I totally disagree with you.  These S2X guys need to be taught a lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:11
In time it will replace the phucking banks.  Lot of people misunderstand HODLers and lack of BTC's for financial transactions.  There are no lack of BTCs.  There will never be.  21 million is just a number.   The entire global trade can be done with just 1 BTC or even a fraction of BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:02:58
Deep inside in the back of that tiny brain of Roger Ver... lurks the truth.  He knows that BCU is worthless.
Now if he can just swallow his pride and work together to activate Segwit, which will make BTC Moon.

That pattern looks like "Inverse head and shoulders."

The fees were phenomenally cheap tonight. Hopefully it gets even cheaper.  I just moved $0.23 @ $0.02 fee just for giggles.  I was shocked to see it confirmed so soon.

yes, you dum dum. What kind of a questing is this?

Is there an English version of the BTCC Mint website?  I would buy a few if I could.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:18:34
But if you provided a fake SS and for some reason the account gets locked with funds inside, how are you going to prove that you are YOU

It's definitely not about the ETF.  The price was rising well before new ETF hopes, if any.  Besides who the hell cares about the ETF anyway?  
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:21:58
Urrrgh!  Coinbase.  Don't get me started on that cesspool of a company. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:19:21
What I meant was overall average over the entire globe?  I couldn't find any info Googling.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:25:25
Cute kid.  Plan B is my Plan A.  hahahaha.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:42:49
Never a problem with Gemini.  No withdrawl limits.  Coinbase was a nightmare for me.  Glad Gemini went on line when they did. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:16:51
Transcactions will be too cheap?  Roger Ver should be all over SegWit adoption.  Doesn't he want to buy cheap azz coffee?  But he's with jihan Wu. I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:04:00
He opens his mouth to show the world what an idiot he is.  The point is to make transactions cheap and fast. It's exactly what they've been fighting for.  Or was it?  
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:45:00
Well, I will start using Jaxx if BIP148 is default.  :)
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:56:48
Can't argue with truth. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:05:53
I think as it nears total 21mil BTC, the protocol will be changed to allow constant halving, so theoretically, we will never reach 21 mil total.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:29:22
Along the same lines, Litecoins were not premined.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:57:29
FACT!  Also, to go even further, we can run the entire economy on just 1 satoshi, just add more zeros.  hahahahaha
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:48:23
You're kidding, right?
@_date: 2016-07-10 00:53:31
Welcome to the club. Leave Coinbase ASAP. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:27:14
I dealt with "not enough BTC" to go around issue.  Then I realized, as most eventually do, that the entire economy can be run with just 1 BTC, or even fractions of BTC. Each BTC can be infinitely divisible if necessary. No one will be stolen of their fiat by buying BTC now, or 10,000 years from now. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:58:52
I don't think I'm addicted, but I do spend all my left over money to buy BTC. Hahahaha.
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:21:29
Thanks everyone. Excellent info. I'm saving all this. :)
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:47:30
I left Coinbase for Gemini.com and haven't looked back. So far, no problems, no hassles at all.  They also have AML/KYC, but once you're approved, they don't bother you.  That has been my experience and my friend as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:38:40

Glad to have you on board.  I invested to the extreme- 99% of my money into crypto a few years ago.  USD and banking system is not a place I want to place trust with my money.  Most people in your life will be naysayers.  Ignore them. It's been a hell of a ride.  My net worth exploded in the last 6 months.  I keep 1/3 BTC, 1/3 ETH, 1/3 upcoming ICOs.
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:33:05
Wow, the most Bull$hit article I've read about BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:15:03
inverse head and shoulders.  It's very clear on 4 hr chart.  It's a bullish pattern.

The computing power to secure BTC network will be completely manageable by a wrist watch in a 100 years.  I can see how we will have millions of nodes in not too distant future.

I left a comment also, but I doubt it'll be posted.  Steven Wilson is a dumbA$$
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:49:04
I believe it now costs approximately $600 to mine just 1 bitcoin.  I read somewhere that it costs about $400,000,000 dollars in electricity costs alone per year to run the network. $400,000,000/657,000BTC mined per year = $608 per Bitcoin.  If the price drops below $600, I'm going full bore buying spree.
