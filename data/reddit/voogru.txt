I don't know why more exchanges don't use some sort of system where a user holds 2 keys, exchange holds one key (not enough to do anything).
User wants to do something, such as sell, withdraw, etc their bitcoins?  They provide the other key which Bitfinex doesn't need to store, or hell, can avoid all together if one part of the transaction is signed on the client. The 'hot wallet' is basically only bitcoins which are for sale on order books or used in margin.
Cold wallet is essentially the users own private wallet.

Except that could have been for other factors that have nothing to do with the halving.

Everyone knows about 'the halvening', so it's already built into the price.
Everyone hoping for a pop when it halves will probably be disappointed, that's not to say bitcoin won't go up... but it won't be because of the 'halvening'. 
What causes violent price jumps is when people don't know information and it comes to light... like if the bitcoin halvening instead of happening at block X... would happen at a random block that nobody could pre-determine (and may not happen at all!)

Nope, they're going to take him aside, and tell him. "Listen, you can keep telling the people what they want to hear, but if you fuck us up, we will simply assassinate you and replace you with someone who will play ball."
When your choice is corruption, or die, you will choose corruption.

It's really quite simple.
Women just aren't into computers as much, which is sad, because they used to be awesome at it. It was not considered 'manly' to sit a a computer on a keyboard all day, which is why most of those jobs went to women...
Then the culture changed.
One thing that upsets me is the claim that bitcoin is 'sexist', saying bitcoin is 'sexist', is like me calling cell phones racist, or a potato a racist.
It's an inanimate object, or in bitcoins case, software. Bitcoin has no idea what sex you are, and on the internet, unless you tell people, people have NO CLUE how old you are, and what sex you are, and even if you say you're a girl, people will assume you're a **g**uy **i**n **r**eal **l**ife.
So if a girl really wants to dive into bitcoin and all of the geeky bitcoin stuff, there's nothing stopping them.

On the internet, nobody knows you're a girl. In fact, people will assume you're a dude, even if you say you're a girl.
A girl that 'dives' into computers on the internet, has just as much potential as any 'guy'. You're judged on how you behave more than how you sound, how you look, or what sex you are.
I wouldn't have been able to do very much in my case in the past, because people would have judged me by my age, and not how I actually operated. In fact, I wouldn't have been able to do very much at all because people would have just instantly dismissed me, simply because of my age. People judged me on my writing style and assumed they were dealing with someone who was much older and I was able to conduct business, despite my age. 
In the real world, they'd see me and be like "huh? run along now go back to xbox"
Most people thought I was in my 30's... **when I was actually 15**
If they just stop getting all offended by silly words said by someone over the internet and just focus on geeky stuff... they'll do fine. The problem is everyone gets so easily offended by everything.

I don't buy this nonsense, there are plenty of fields out there that women dominate, and men don't, simply because of **preferences**.
Most nurses? Women. Is there some conspiracy among female nurses against male nurses? Nope. 
Just most men prefer to do something other than nursing.
Most women prefer not to do programming and prefer to do something else that interests them. **Do what you love**.
The same used to be true with programming, sitting on a keyboard all day typing was not *manly*, it was something women did. Men? They did manly stuff. Welding, construction, manufacturing.

There are two sides though, one side may think that bitcoin will become more valuable when it halves, however there is another side that thinks bitcoin will die in a fire.
By the time of the next halving, the "die in the fire" question may be better answered, resulting in either dramatically higher prices before the halving, if the "die in a fire" turns out to be false.

No, I want the physical gold. Here's my address and some money for shipping and handling.
Can I do that?
If I have to sell the claim check and then hope to go buy it somewhere else, in a financial collapse, guess what? 
That's not going to fly. By the time you sell it and go try to buy any gold, the price will be up significantly.
If Apmex can figure out how to ship gold to my house after purchasing it, I don't see what's so difficult about Bitreserve doing the same, that is, if they actually have the gold.

Food prices next month will be 50% less than food prices today, this statement will ALWAYS BE TRUE.
So that must mean that everyone will wait until next month to eat, when food is 50% cheaper, and when next month comes, if they wait another month, it'll be even cheaper...
Now, lets apply this to a full scale economy.
Deflation would be a few %, depending on how much the economy expands (how much new shit there is), if there are 3% more cars, prices of cars will go down.
Your car just broke down. You need a new one now.
If you wait a whole year, you will save 3% on the price of a new car. This statement will always be true, even in a year, if you wait another year, you'll save an additional 3%.
So by your logic, you will never buy a car.

All bitcoin is, is a ledger. Every bank already has these ledgers. If they fully control their own blockchain, they can make arbitrary changes to it as well, just like any other ledger.
The reality is the blockchain would kind of be worthless to them, because they already trust themselves. There's no advantage to forking bitcoin and creating their own chain internally for their own purposes.
Where bitcoin shines, it's a ledger that can be used by millions of parties that don't trust each other. So for example, a bank has a contract with an insurance company, the insurance company claims to have X assets, Y cash. How do you prove they really have that?

Bitcoin is deflationary so, by design it's supposed to become more and more rare, so over time, a higher price, encouraging people to save them, rather than spend them.

You're assuming they're all going to shut off at the same time, that's not true.

Yes, someone is going to expend hundreds of millions of dollars, or billions of dollars, in order to have a monopoly on a currency, that everyone will just stop using the minute they try to do something bad.
Hmm, let's see:
Option 1: Spend billions of dollars to monopolize the mining, but don't go evil. Rake in billions worth of bitcoins in mining fees (theoretically, in the future, if bitcoin gets to that level).
Option 2: Spend billions of dollars to monopolize the mining, then go evil. Then slowly destroy the system by censoring transactions and eventually people lose confidence in the system.
Option 2 doesn't sound like a very good monopoly.
I think the purpose of a monopoly is to hold onto it as long as possible so that you can make bookoo bucks.

I'm sorry, I just don't see how someone who genuinely wants to donate to Mozilla, is going to abandon the whole idea because of the placement of some text on the donate page.
The same goes with 'abandoned' shopping carts, how do you know these people actually intended to make a purchase? They may have just been adding things up.
I do this all of the time to figure out how much a bunch of stuff is going to cost with shipping and everything, I don't have any intention of buying it at that moment, so regardless of what text is on the checkout page, I'm not gonna pull the trigger.
Sometimes I create the same cart on another site and find out the whole thing is cheaper, and I buy there instead.
If somebody wants to buy something, a text out of the way somewhere on the page won't stop them. It sure hasn't ever stopped me.
The only thing that would stop them is if you actually put something that interferes, such as a page where they can only pay with bitcoin, and then they have to go searching for the credit card form. That, yes, obviously will hurt sales because now you're confusing people.

They're still claim checks against gold. If you can't take the claim check to the vault and pickup the gold, it's not gold.
They sell more claim checks for the gold than the amount of gold they actually have, just like the Federal Reserve did.


If I was concerned about the financial system, and was looking to buy gold, I'd buy the physical stuff. Yes, it costs more, the spreads on buying and selling are ridiculous on smaller amounts.
But it's physical and there's no dispute who it belongs to.

Under capitalism you have the ability to hire people to protect your property, which includes your body.
Under a system you describe where 'property is theft', I fail to see what would allow such a defense to exist.
Here's a question for you, a bunch of an-coms plant a field of tomatoes, once the field is mature and ready for harvesting, a bunch of an-coms who DIDN'T plant the field of tomatoes spend the time and effort to harvest them.
Who gets the tomatoes? 
Both expended time and effort into the production of said tomatoes, but the ones who harvest them obviously control them now.
What if they refuse to hand them over? What if the an-coms that harvested the tomatoes outnumber the ones that planted them, and can simply 'vote' in the direct democracy to keep all, or a majority of the tomatoes?
The an-coms that planted and maintained the field, are they likely to do it again? They will have to defend their fields, which means... in a sense, they own it, and you've just created private property.

They already sell stuff, and anyone who wanted to do business with them, already did so before they even accepted bitcoin.
In fact, I'm pretty sure everyone would accept bitcoin if you just exchange it into dollars for them before doing business with them, so by your logic of 'more merchants = price goes down even more' is flawed.
Because if you want to buy something, and the merchant doesn't accept bitcoin, you just convert it for them.
And hey, now is always the best time, because bitcoin is doomed and the price will just keep going down forever until the whole thing falls apart.

Sure, you can peg yourself to the Titanic and Lusitania, although it would be pretty inconvenient. 
Can you come up with a way of creating an **artificial** peg, without involving a third party? Tell me, what happens if the third party that guarantees the peg, becomes compromised?
Remember, pegs are artificial, since you're not allowing the market to decide what the price should be.
Don't forget that the US dollar was pegged to gold, so the most powerful government on earth failed in maintaining their own peg.
Let us know when you find a third party capable of maintaining an artificial peg, if the most powerful government on the face of the earth can't do it...
The best way is to allow the market to work, it's going to be a bumpy ride, but this is quite literally, the only way to do this. It must free-float.

Except I don't want USD, I want **gold**.
If someone is buying gold, they think the USD is going to fall, they are preparing for an event where the gold price skyrockets against USD, or any currency.
So in the event that happens, why would they want their contract to specify they are to get USD? If they end up being right, by the time they get their USD and convert it to gold, the price of gold will be significantly higher, because the currency is failing.
They may not even be able to convert the USD to gold, there could be gold shortages, they may end up stuck with the USD.
This is counterparty risk.
And by gold, I mean physical gold, in your hand. Not a IOU.

In that case, they could have put anything at all in that space and the result would have been the same. If they put the logos of various credit cards and the conversion rate went down, you wouldn't argue that accepting credit cards = less revenue.
The other thing, this is not so much of a cart, but a donation. You're not buying anything. 
Here's another thing, a lot of times I add things to a cart to see how much everything would cost including shipping, with no intention of actually purchasing the items right then.
I remember one time adding some very high priced items to a shopping cart (six figures), to compare to buying them locally when taking into account the shipping.
Local turned out to be cheaper in that case, but I received a phone call from the merchant asking if I was having any trouble.
So I'm willing to bet a lot of 'abandoned carts' are just people figuring out what everything is going to cost them, comparing it with a competitor, and then they go with the competitor and 'abandon' the cart.
If they would have put "DONATE WITH BITCOIN" page before taking them to the donate with a credit card page, when they try to donate, then you'd have an argument, because then it would be getting in the way.
I'd like to see this test tried with another piece of text in the same location, or credit card logos only.

Yes, it's called central planning, in disguise of course.
In RBE, do you build a car out of aluminum, or titanium? The cost of both resources is $0.
Titanium is obviously better, but is that really the best use of titanium? For the application of a car, wouldn't aluminum be just fine? And we can save the titanium for where it really matters?
When you have RBE, you can't answer these questions.
The risk is that we waste resources on things that don't really make a difference, because cars out of titanium would be better than aluminum, but aluminum would do just fine. The result?
Less titanium available for where it would make a difference.
Which means resources are being wasted.
RBE has 'experts' that will try to decide these things, and you end up with central planners with defacto dictatorship type power.

A larger entity saves up resources in order to pay a bunch of workers to build the factory.
Go ask yourself any construction worker if they would accept **ZERO PAY** to spend a few years of their life building a factory, for the **POSSIBILITY** that they may benefit from the production (with no promises on how much that may be).
No one is going to take that job.
Someone has to foot the bill to build the factory with saved resources (read: money), in order for it to be worth it, they have to believe they will make a return on that money by building the factory.
If you don't have private property, they're just not going to build that factory in the first place, and again, nobody is going to work for free for months or years for a mere promise of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
They need to eat today.
On top of that how do you divide up the production? Some workers are more skilled than others, some do more work than others, how do you decide who gets what?
By the way, this kind of organization is possible today. It's perfectly legal for a bunch of people, on their own, to pool their resources, and collectively build a factory and benefit from it's production.
There's only one problem: RISK.
Most people don't like risk.
And, why are people going to pool their resources to build a factory if someone else, who never did anything for it, could just come in and use it in another way? Remember, property is theft. 
So if a bunch of workers build a factory and start benefiting from it's production, what about me? Say I have done nothing to contribute to building that factory, why can't I just go in there and start taking from it's industrial production, or commanding the machinery in a way I see fit that the people who build the factory don't approve of?
They don't own it, so how do they stop me? What if I take the machines and decide to do something else with it? What if I want the factory to produce something completely different?
The only solution to that problem is the factory is owned by the people who contributed to it, meaning, you have private industrial property.
Otherwise someone else can come and take your capital goods and do something else with it, which may affect your own output of what you want.

How many bitcoins have been deposited to their service, and how much do they have in reserve?
Pretty sure those two numbers are going to be wildly out of proportion. It's not so much bitreserve, but AssetReserve where we just convert your bitcoin assets to something else and hope it does better than bitcoin does (which again, may be a good bet).

But it may still go against you. They may put the money into 'sound' investments, 'sound' being determined by the masses, and then you have a huge stock market crash and... poof, suddenly they don't have as much as they thought they did.
We bought bitcoin to be seperate from that system, by putting them into bitreserve, they convert it to USD, then invest with it, you're setting yourself up for the fact that you may receive fewer bitcoins in the future.
You have the risk that their investments don't provide any returns, or go down in value, and the risk that bitcoin goes up from when you deposited them into bitreserve.
Where as if you own bitcoin, your risk is the price of bitcoin.
When you have bitcoins on a address, there's no counterparty risk, you own those ledger entries, period. Nothing else is promised for those ledger entries, but there's no counterparty that can fail and result in lost of the entries.
The entries value may go to zero, but they'll still be there.
Owning a bitcoin is the same as owning gold and having it in your hand, the value of the bitcoin may go to zero, but you'll still have them (yes, it may be worthless, but that's beside the point). 
Likewise, the value of gold may go down, but you'll still have gold.

Here's what Bitreserve does:
1. You transfer your bitcoins to bitreserve.
2. They sell your bitcoins.
3. They take the proceeds and invest it in the stock market, bonds, etc, hoping to get a return.
4. When you want your money back, they convert the dollar proceeds from the sale of your bitcoin, back to bitcoin, at the prevailing exchange rate, which may be more bitcoins, or less bitcoins, depending on what happened with the exchange rate.
If you think the exchange rate of bitcoin will go up, if you're right, you will lose bitcoins.
Bitreserve makes money from the return, in effect, they're going promising the preserve the US dollar value.
However, if Bitreserves investments don't do so hot, and they lose money, the users who deposited money are at risk of losing principle, just like any investment, except, there's no upside either.
So in otherwords you're buying stocks, exposing yourself to the risk of stocks, and only preserving the value of your current bitcoins.
You can do this all on your own by simply selling your bitcoin.

I can do the same thing on a bitcoin exchange, swap between US dollars and bitcoin instantly.
They don't give you any cut of any revenue they generate from your holdings, and they have a risk that their investments go south and they end up in a situation where they can't even return your initial deposit.
It's literally the same as selling your bitcoin, you sell the bitcoin, you have x dollars. Period.
Basically, that's what they're doing, you transfer 15k worth of bitcoin, they sell them, we owe you 15k of bitcoin. Hopefully what we do with the money pays off, if not, ruh roh.
But on a good day, we'll give you back your 15k of bitcoin. Not a penny more.
If you think bitcoin will succeed and go up in price, this is a dumb thing to do, because as they are selling bitcoins, you're not investing in bitcoin anymore, you're investing in whatever they invest the money into.
And hey, this year, it was a good deal because bitcoin went down in price and the stock market is doing what all stock markets do when the government prints lots of money out of thin air.
But will that be true next year? Do you think bitcoin will continue to slide next year and go below $300, maybe below $250? Or lower?
What are the implications if bitcoin fails and bitreserve has your money that's out of bitcoin?

I'm just looking at it from what the software sees, and ignoring what we call the denominations.
The software doesn't see 1 bitcoin as 1, it sees it as 100000000. We may call it 1 bitcoin, but the software doesn't care.

Not quite.
Investing = Buying something expecting to get a return out of it, i.e., buying a share of stock that pays you a dividend every quarter, or the company will be worth more in the future which will reflect higher stock price. Investing money into a business and getting a share of the business and the profits down the road.
Speculation = Buying something expecting to sell it at a higher price in the future, with no change in the underlying asset.
A bitcoin today, will still be a bitcoin tomorrow, regardless of price. A bitcoin in the future may be more useful than it is today, but it's still a bitcoin.
A share of a corporation, will be a % of a larger amount of assets, or a fewer amount of assets (depending on performance), or a claim on a % of their income.

Someone that's trying to bring the price down artificially, by dumping into the market, if they are selling their own reserves or shorting, another player can come in and essentially put him at a disadvantage by simply buying to bring the price back up. 
The player that shorted or dumped his stash may choose to get back in... at a higher price, losing money, or losing some of his bitcoins. So next time around he won't be able to dump as many back down into the market.
To the opposite end, a player that wants to artificially bring the price up can be undone by another large player that dumps into him, leaving him with less fiat to push the price up.
Eventually as there are more and more players, these swings will dampen and get less and less, because there are too many players. This has already happened, bitcoin used to have 20-30-40-50% daily price swings, it was common. Now we see a price swing of 5% and everyone loses their mind.
An analogy I like, imagine a Olympic sized swimming pool and there's a a few fat people making big waves, and then some little kids (you, for example).
The fat people can be pretty annoying to you, they can make big waves, and they can make much bigger waves than the little kids.
However, if you fill up the pool with more little kids that exceeds the weight of all of the fat people combined, suddenly they don't have as much influence on whats happening in the pool. All of the little kids can counter any waves made by the fat people, because they outnumber him in number and total weight.
Right now we have a few fat people and not very many little kids.
So, relax. Bitcoin will be fine. If bitcoin can't survive a fat guy making a few waves, then it's not ready for the little kids to get into yet.

Yeah, there's just no way they can take the bitcoin blockchain, tally up all of the balances, and then import them into an alt of Etherum that uses the data from the bitcoin blockchain and re-implements the bitcoin currency in the new and improved system while preserving everyone who ever held any bitcoins.
Nope, that'd never happen. They'd just switch to using another altcurrency that may be superceded by yet another even better one in a few years.
Yeah, no. If there is a real altcoin that improves over bitcoin, and the bitcoin dev team says f u and bitcoin really starts to suffer, someone will take the blockchain, import the data into the new altcoin and poof all of the new improvements and everyone has the same amount of bitcoins.
You have the added benefit that there are already thousands of users who already own bitcoin, and existing entrenched infrastructure based on bitcoin.

Nobody. The price would plummet instantly and they'd be bagholders.

They sell the bitcoins to 'lock' the value. They may also be bullish on the price long term, so they're using it as an avenue to purchase bitcoin without the price going up.
If they end up being right, when you 'unlock' your bitcoins, you receive the same value, which will be fewer bitcoins, and the difference is their profit.

Welcome to Democrazy!
Ultimately, someone has to make a decision how to use those machines.
Your system is likely to use central planners.


You're confusing the current fascist style economy with capitalism, under real capitalism with there is too much expansion there is a bust that allows for reallocation of resources. Governments for centuries have been trying to pump up these bubbles into bigger and bigger bubbles because the busts are painful and, like I mentioned earlier, people hate risk.
So governments try to paper it over, but of course, they fail.
The other thing the endless inflation of currency discourages preserving resources, because if you preserve your wealth, the government inflates it away. A real capitalist system would ultimately be deflationary, encouraging people NOT to consume resources and rewarding them slowly over time for NOT consuming.
Ultimately, they will consume resources, but they won't be consuming resources for the sake of consuming resources because if they don't, they won't be able to buy as much in the future.

Accepting credit cards isn't accepting dollars either, you're accepting VisaUSD/MastercardUSD/AmexUSD.
It's not dollars until it hits your bank account 3 business days later.
Same case for bitcoin, the difference is instead of it starting out as VisaUSD/AmexUSD/MastercardUSD, it's Bitcoin.
Also take note that credit cards can be in different currencies and then levy a foreign exchange fee on top of all of the other fees. When someone comes from the Euro and has a VISA with a Euro bank account, the merchant doesn't accept Euro's either. They want dollars.
So the merchant processor does that automatically as well.
Bitcoin is no different.

Are those the same macroeconomic books that the likes of Paul Krugman would recommend?
The thing is, I'm really not so certain how a fake space alien invasion, and spending lots of debt in order to defend against a non-existent threat, would prove to be beneficial long term to the economy. It sounds to me like you would just end up with a bubble that will pop once people figure out there is no alien threat.
Perhaps you can prolong it by killing anyone who tries to tell people it's fake though... or maybe marginalize them the same way we do so with 9/11 truthers.
Also, I don't think that the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center did any economic good, like Paul Krugman did.
I mean sure we created a lot of jobs rebuilding the towers, but absent that terrorist attack, we could have still built new towers and we'd have more buildings!
This is the kind of nonsense that are in the macroeconomic books. I've already picked them up and was dumber for it, never again.

Where is the gold and USD stored? You have to have a counterparty that hands over any gold or USD when it's redeemed.
To put it another way, in order for bitgold to be backed by gold, someone has to deposit gold somewhere, and then they get bitgold in return.
When they want gold back, they turn in the bitgold, and gold goes to them.
So with Bitshares, where does someone go to deposit their gold to get Bitgold?
If that doesn't exist... then how is bitgold entered into circulation, without gold being put on deposit somewhere?
How do you verify that the gold has been deposited? How do you know it even exists?

Except without private property, you end up with the Tragedy of the commons.
Also, who's going to put in the effort to build a factory, if he can't realistically benefit from it? Someone has to build the factory, what if someone wants to use the land to build a factory, but someone else wants to 'preserve' the land in it's natural state.
Who gets to decide that?
In comes central planning...
You can't be an anarchist and also against the idea of the concept of property, the concept of property is part of human nature, if I take an unclaimed piece of land and make use of it, being as I'm making use of it, it becomes mine.
I then plant trees on it, or plant food on it, or raise livestock on it, that otherwise would not exist, that also becomes mine.
If none of that is mine, then I'm not going to bother doing any of that, and you end up with a lot of empty land that benefits nobody, because nobody wants to improve it, because they won't get to lay claim to the production from it.
Under your system you will need a government to enforce the lack of industrial property, where as under an anarcho-capitalist system, we don't need a government to enforce private property, we just hire people to protect our property.
So in my eyes, anarcho-communism is an oxymoron.

Here's the problem with pegging.
Pegging is like tying your little boat to the large ship, by pegging yourself to a large ship, it's very unlikely your boat will ever sink. If it leaks, you will be held up by the large ship and not sink.
The only trouble is when you peg yourself to an unsinkable ship, like the Titanic for example, where god himself could not sink it.
Don't worry though, the US dollar is unsinkable, just like the Titanic.
The answer to your question is no, the currency must float based on supply and demand, for better or for worse. If it's 'backed' by something, you involve a third party, and if that third party is corrupt, the value disappears. See e-gold.

Uh, they could be large holders of Bitcoin, and this development might save their investments. There's a huge profit incentive to preserve the system.
Nevermind the fact that the amount of time to do this would be minuscule, it would just be a matter of copypaste Ether, and use bitcoins ledger instead of the Ether ledger. The 'genesis' would be an agreed block # from bitcoin and then credit every public key with x coins on the new system.
Then implement it into the bitcoin code to take over in +1000 blocks or whatever, so that the transition is seemless.
All of the work would have already been done by Ether.
Unless of course they make it closed source, but then it's not an open source digital currency then, is it?
The problem with Ether is let's assume that Ether is better than bitcoin, so bitcoin flops and Ether takes over, how do you know that Ether won't suffer the same fate in five years when something even better comes out?

In fact, the software stores the value as an integer, and 1 'bitcoin' is actually 100,000,000 internally in the software.
So, as usual, you are full of shit. You're not buying a 'piece' of one, when it's being split up.

It would be interesting if every packet had a tiny amount of money in it, and before the receiver would accept your traffic, you essentially have to attach a miniscule amount of money (something of the magnitude of a billionth of a penny). It could be configurable as well, so only comes into effect when too many people are going for a resource.
I don't think bitcoin in it's current form could scale to that level however.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:58:55
It can, except when a bank fails because they didn't have enough reserves, they can't be bailed out unless the people decide to bail them out.

It won't increase the price right away, but if demand for bitcoin increases in the future, there's less supply to deal with that demand.
Had the bitcoin reward not halved at all, I'm fairly certain the price would have never got to $1100-1200, and would not be sitting at $350 right now.
It would be higher than it was back then, but not at the current levels.
@_date: 2014-11-30 07:15:14
But even that won't work because people would use some other form of value.
As long as there is demand for a 'cash', people will come up with one all on their own. The concept of money preceded governments.

By the way, I have nothing against the idea of another cryptocurrency that's better than bitcoin, it's just there have been quite a lot of shitcoins and IPO scams that I'm highly suspect of them all (as I was highly suspect of bitcoin at the start).
In order for them to challenge bitcoin, they'll have to be an order of a magnitude better than bitcoin, and then the advancement of bitcoin pretty much has to be asleep at the wheel in epic hardcore failsauce fashion.
I just don't see that happening, there's a lot of money riding on bitcoin, and if bitcoin does fail, it could destroy a lot of confidence in other systems as well for a number of years.

Actually, the term "income" used to mean a profit or earning money without additional work.
For example you take $100, buy a stock, and get dividends, those dividends = income.
However, if you take 8 hours of your day, and at the end of the day you're paid $100, that is not income. You traded 8 hours of your life for $100.
Or, if you take $100, and turned it into $200 via buying and selling, the extra $100 would be income. 
When it comes to taxes, they only tax the $100 you actually made, not the whole $200, because you started with $100. 
How much is a day of your life worth? Government says it's worth $0....
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:52:36

They can.
For $35.
What I like to do is go to the bank ATM, withdraw cash from the account, then in the same ATM, deposit to the another account.
I need both debit cards and PIN's, but that's actually how I transfer money between my bank accounts rather than online transfers.
It's free and instant.
You may get funny looks though from the people behind you seeing you withdraw some money and then seemingly just put it back in.
I've also done this with the regular tellers when dealing with larger amounts.
First "I'd like to withdraw from my X account", they count everything, I count everything, then just as I'm about to leave, "Now deposit it into my Y account".
"You know you can do online transfers..."
"Yep, this is faster and I won't wait three days for the transfer and the $35 transfer fee. So instead I'll just waste your time and the time of everyone behind me for something that should be instant online."

Welcome to the fucking free market, deal with it. As bitcoin matures, their influence will get lower and lower, but we need these periods. 
Another advantage of these periods is it causes a redistribution, a large bitcoin whale that tries to manipulate, and fails at it, his bitcoins usually end up in the hands of smaller whales. Like the 30k bearwhale.
By the way, I totally sympathize with your plight, I would much prefer that the price remain stable, but these are vital growing pains that bitcoin **must** go through. 
Trying to fix it with bullshit laws, will not change the reality of the situation, it will just make it even worse. What will happen is the whales will get even bigger because the super-whales will have government influence, and they'll just be able to monopolize it completely.
Here is one way you can look at it. If you take a little kid, and you put him in a plastic bubble his whole life, so he never gets sick, the minute you take him out of that bubble, he's going to get the most simplest disease or sickness and, since his immune system has never had to fight in it's life, possibly kills him.
Laws are basically that little plastic bubble. It may make bitcoin more stable in the short run, but when it comes to the real fucking world, it'll be in a world of hurt.
These large waves, are the real world.
Relax, they'll calm down eventually, and I believe, at a higher price. My mouth is quite literally where my mouth is.

Let me know when you see an animal make an exchange of things they each value differently with another animal.
i.e., a squirrel trading some nuts for something else they want more than the some nuts RIGHT NOW, that they can turn around and trade it for even more nuts from some other squirrels in six months and make a profit. A 'Nut' claim check of some sort that bears interest. Perhaps the squirrels that borrow the nuts use it to pay other squirrels to hunt more nuts than they pay with and are able to stockpile more nuts, or build a nut farm but they needed some nuts to pay everyone with to build it.
Oh right, they don't do that.

One theory I have is the person who hacked the exchange, possibly used some of the stolen bitcoins to run a huge leverage short on the exchanges that allow for leverage, he dumped not caring if it all gets lost.
With a 20:1 short on even 2k BTC, you can cause quite a bit of havoc, the goal of course is to cause a panic and people to send their bitcoins to the exchange in order to dump them.
And if you have their hot wallet hacked well... you can steal even more bitcoin.

So I guess in the event that Bitcoin succeeds, Amazon, Google, and whatnot will not host full nodes for Internet Money.
In fact, they could host full nodes and allow the chaindata to be used by other full nodes that could query against it when needed.
It's a degree of centralization, but they would ultimately be kept honest by other companies and services that host the blockchain.
Perhaps there could be nodes that audit the blockchain on the centralized service and make sure there's no funny business.

The best part is you can do this without Bitreserve.
All bitrserve does is sell your bitcoins for you, invests it, hoping to make a return, then if you want your money back, they give you back the same $ amount.
Essentially you're giving them use of your money for nothing in return but risk they actually lose money investing it in other things.
So the best way to protect your value is to simply sell the bitcoins yourself if you're thinking of using 'Bitreserve'.
If you're investing in bitcoin because you think bitcoin will go up in value, the dumbest thing you can do is use bitreserve.

The goal is to have enough regulations that everyone is in violation of at least 50-100 regulations, then when they show up they just cite for 1 or 2 violations.
If the business is rude, they cite for maybe 5-6 violations. 
If the business is a competitor to a friend of yours and won't sell out to your friend, maybe 20-30 violations...stop work... 
In some countries (and coming soon here probably), they create new regulations for the sole purpose of requiring more employees in the regulators office. i.e., the printer paper can only be installed by a licensed professional paper installer. 
The best part? Due to their unequal enforcement of their existing regulations, something goes horribly wrong. They didn't properly enforce their own regulations on some business because they were buddy-buddy, and the shit hits the fan. (Bernie Madoff...)
The solution?
WE NEED MORE REGULATIONS! MORE REGULATORS!

It could be another bank on the other side of the world. For example, banks use the blockchain instead of ACH/SEPA/international wire transfer, the thing is, the banks are using dollars/euros/whatever.
So when joining the network they agree on an exchange rate and use the blockchain to keep track of which bank owns what.


More programming, more hired programmers to solve the issues bitcoin still faces, also i'd like to see bitcoin terminals that do mining. I think it would be an interesting prospect if everything connected to the bitcoin network did mining, even if done at a loss, the loss to the owner of the machine is negligible.
The idea is for far more mining done by smaller devices that use bitcoin to help decentralize the network.

I highly doubt it because of the activity that took place on the exchanges as the hack was happening. It seems like there was a lot of dumping on the exchanges as he had the hot wallet hacked.
The dumping was intended to scare people to move their bitcoins to an exchange in order to sell, he intentionally brought it down past 266 to cause an epic panic.
The 18k BTC he got in the hot wallet was probably the amount of deposits that were made during that event.
The amount of dumping could be done either by a few whales, or send some stolen bitcoins to a leverage exchange and go 20:1 not caring if you lose.
1. Dump coins to scare people into wanting to sell.
2. People panic move their bitcoins to an exchange (and some obviously use bitstamp)
3. Steal their bitcoins that you may have not have got otherwise.
He had a short time frame to deal with and didn't want to wait until monday where he might get discovered. It kind of explains the epic dumping over the weekend.

You can have a fiat currency that is fixed. 
In theory, fiat can actually be better than gold, because you never know, someone might come up with a cheap way to come up with a ton of gold.
The trouble is with normal fiat currencies the temptation to print is just too high. In theory it's good, in practice not so much.
A decentralized software program kind of resolves that, but whether it works or not over the long term remains to be seen. 
A lot of people bitch about the 21 million limit. The limit is irrelevant. The limit could be 1 million, or 1 zillion, the amount of currency units doesn't matter. What matters is the amount of STUFF.
As long as the units can be divided up for small transactions, it can be used, and in bitcoins case there's 2.1 quadrillion units.


There is, there's always a possibility that someone could start their lives making $60,000/yr and in 30 years they're making $30,000 a year, even though they may be able to buy more with that $30,000 than they could with the with the $60,000 a year they will feel still as if they're making less money, simply because the paychecks have a smaller number on them.
But the number is meaningless, what matters is what you can buy with it.
A proper education in the early years would probably overcome this effect, also, I don't think it would be this drastic, more like incomes just remaining the same with either no raises, or less raises over time. The economy doesn't expand forever and it does occasionally contract.
The way things work now is people make more money but can buy less with it, because the raises lag inflation, so they are worse off in the system we have now. On top of that if they're trying to save money, they're cheated out of that too.
Creating new money out of thin air doesn't increase the amount of real goods and services, all it does is transfer wealth from the people holding currency units to the people who have connections to the people who create the currency. Nothing new is created.

A lot of people first dabbled into bitcoin when the news headlines hit in the 2013 November bubble. That's when my friends started caring about it, not when I told them about it in the years prior.
They of course expected it to go to $10,000 within a year making them all millionaires.
These people are basically just people hoping to get rich quick. 
Here's how I look at it, it took one month to go from $100 to $1100~ (don't consider 1200 gox price to be 'real').
It took over a year to bleed down to $275 (and I think the last major drop had something to do with the bitstamp hacking and not more people getting out of bitcoin because OMG its failing I'm not rich yet!).
I've seen several of these phases where everyone claims doom and gloom for bitcoin. It's the same bullshit every time.

By his logic, people should be rushing to spend their bitcoins because the value will surely plummet even more. So this should create even more sell pressure. "You better buy whatever you want with bitcoins now, because tomorrow you'll be able to buy less!" look at the past year, it's way less purchasing power.
If less people are buying stuff from merchants rushing to get the fuck out of their bitcoins, then that's clearly not happening.
Second, you can buy anything with bitcoin, so long as you just convert it to dollars first. So the whole ruse about "Well if more merchants accept bitcoin there will be more selling and that's bad for the price!!!!"
If someone wants to buy something from a company and they don't accept bitcoin, they can, right now, SELL THE FUCKING BITCOINS THEY HAVE, and BUY WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT WITH IT.
So when a new merchant accepts bitcoin, you're not going to all of a sudden have a bunch of new business, because if someone really wanted something they had, they'd just sell some bitcoins and pay cash/credit card.
So they get an initial rush of supporters and then it goes to organic demand.
And before you rush in and say "Well if everyone dumps their bitcoins and buys stuff the prices in terms of bitcoins will skyrocket and bitcoin will be worthless!"
The same is true for every currency, the difference is bitcoin is a tiny, but if everyone tried to exit the US dollar and buy REAL STUFF WITH IT, then prices of everything in terms of US dollars would skyrocket too.

New merchants doesn't automatically mean everyone rushes to buy stuff from the merchant.
If you really want to buy something and have bitcoin, you sell the bitcoin, and go buy what you want. This theory that the reason why bitcoin is crashing is because people are cashing out their bitcoins through the merchants is nonsense.
If they wanted to cash out, they'd sell it for dollars and go buy what they want. Why wait? The price might go down!
It would only be true if you could not sell your bitcoins for dollars or other currencies, and if that was the case, then no merchant would accept it anyway.

That's all fine and dandy, but Bitreserve converts bitcoins to USD (or other commodities), and then stores them in the same financial system.
In the case of USD, you are storing them in those same big banks. It's actually illegal for an entity to store 100% reserves of US dollars on their own (meaning, not just using a bank account, but physically in possession of physical cash in dedicated vaults which belong to users of the institution).
Just like it's illegal to store cash in a safety deposit box (yes, this is illegal).
So you can't have 100% reserves, because where the USD is deposited does not have 100% reserves. The only way to get 100% reserves is physically store the cash, or perhaps get yourself a bank account at the federal reserve and store cash there (good luck with that), and that's quite debatable whether it's really 100% reserve or they just fire up the presses when you 'withdraw'.

When you download the full bitcoin core, and have a full copy of the blockchain, you can edit it.
You can give yourself a bazillion Bitcoins.
The problem is the rest of the network is going to say: "haha, nice try."
So in order to 'hack' the blockchain, you must somehow hack the entire network. It's not hard to hack 1 website, but imagine trying to hack every single website that exists.
At once.
To delete something, well, you need to delete every copy of the blockchain. Good luck deleting the copy I have on a USB stick.

The same can be said for LEGAL DRUGS.


Banning alcohol is not a reasonable law.


Guess what? They still happened during prohibition, except now you have the mob involved in protecting their territory, with drive by shootings. Look at police deaths before, during, and after prohibition. 
It was a massacre... that disappeared once they stopped prohibition. Hmm...


If they pass a law saying posting to reddit is a criminal speech offense... that does not make us real criminals.
Once upon a time, possession of a printing press was a criminal offense. That doesn't make the book maker a real criminal.
The declaration of independence talks specifically about pretend crimes. 
The definition of a real criminal is simple, someone that has caused undue harm to another person, either physically or monetarily, theft, assault, fraud, property damage, stuff like that.

I wouldn't be so quick to judge, actually.
      defined(NDEBUG)
     # error "Bitcoin cannot be compiled without assertions."
     
It looks like the Bitcoin code requires compilation with asserts enabled in production mode (both Core and BU), which in my opinion is silly, but it is what it is. If that's the case, then the original post is correct that an assert(0) would freeze the node.
By the way, an assert(0) isn't a crash, but usually stops the program from working while it displays a message. It would require someone to click on "ignore" for the program to start working again.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:07:26
There's actually a bit of technical issues with some miners, some of them are using a custom compiled version of the bitcoin node software in their infrastructure, and the newer versions of bitcoin core have some newer C++ standards in them.
They might not be incentivised to update their software without some pushing. Bigger blocks are also easier code wise than something like SegWit, for miners to implement if they have custom code.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:26:26

Asserts are only active in debug builds. In a release build they are replaced with void code and usually eliminated by the compiler. Just fyi.
You would have to be running a debug compile for the assert to freeze the node.
**Edit: It's been pointed out to me that Bitcoin (both Core and BU) won't compile without Asserts enabled.**
      defined(NDEBUG)
     # error "Bitcoin cannot be compiled without assertions."
     
Which means the assert in the original post would in fact freeze the node with a dialog until the user hits "ignore".
Whoever wrote this code probably made the same mistake and assumed incorrectly that the assert would not exist in release mode.

Bitcoin to altcoin has zero impact on USD price.
Bitcoin to altcoin and then the person who sold their Bitcoin for USD would have an impact on the BTCUSD price.
Another thing, one way you can kind of tell the whole 'flippening' is nonsense, we don't see a ridiculous amount of:
BTC to Altcoin -&gt; Altcoin Seller Sells BTC for USD -&gt; USD back into Altcoin.
Because if we did, altcoins would be going even more bananas.

Sell = Selling to BID orders on the market.
Buy = Buying from ASK orders on the market.
If I sell 1 bitcoin at the current ask price, it's a "SELL", if I list my bitcoin for $1200 on the market, and the current price is 1199, and then someone buys my order at $1200, it's a BUY.

What if they mature slowly over 12 months instead?
So rather than at the end of the year 12.5 BTC, they'd get 1.04 BTC of it per month * the amount of blocks they got that month.
Of course it wouldn't need to be 12 months, could be any duration of time.
There would also likely be a sort of market as well, they could 'sell' those mined BTC's at a discount to someone else to get immediate funding, if people think miners are up to no good, they could charge higher rates.

1. The value of the dollar constantly changes, however, because so many people use it, it's not that volatile day to day.
2. The US dollar has no valuation guarantee, in fact, nothing does.

What! Don't be absurd! OF COURSE PEOPLE WANT MONEY.
Nope. They don't.

Because the United States government engaged in fraud, printed more dollar receipts than the amount of gold it backed, foreigners figured it out and started a run on the treasury.
In otherwords, it's like a bank engaging in fractional reserves, then once the depositors figured it out, the bank doesn't allow anyone to withdraw the money anymore... and keeps it forever, and instead gives people "shares" in the bank which they continuously dilute over time.
Today we call this a bail-in.

@_date: 2017-03-17 22:42:34
Two options:
1. Cold storage, wait until the result is in on a 'winning' fork. End up with coins on both chains. (but the loser chain coins aren't worth much)
2. Sell both for Fiat when you can (hoping both will be crashing), then buy back in when the winner is determined.
The issue with  is you could wait it out, and you will end up with coins on the 'winning' fork, while the 'losing' fork coins lose all value. 
But it's possible that during the whole fiasco, both coins combined will have a higher value than the single coin once the results are in.
So you maximize the potential by selling both, and it should be for fiat rather than altcoin bubble.

Sure. Someone might come out with something better than bitcoin, but in order for something to be better than bitcoin, and decentralized, it would have to be open source.
Sure, a central bank could make their own digital currency and not have the scalability issues, but now you have government digital currency, and in that world, bitcoin still has an application as a non-governmental digital asset.


What is Bitcoin though? Bitcoin is a ledger. Let's say some new software comes along and blows the existing Bitcoin code out of the water... if it's decentralized and open source... what stops anyone from taking the code, and importing the existing unspent outputs into the new system somehow?
Not to mention which do you think will have a better chance of catching on? A new digital currency that has no ledger history, but vastly outperforms bitcoin, or a version of bitcoin which vastly outperforms bitcoin, and uses the existing ledger?
You might argue "what if it's not open source?", well, nobody will trust it.
If something truly is a threat to bitcoin, it can be copied and we just import the existing bitcoin ledger into it, and retire the old outdated blockchain.
AKA, a hard fork.
You're thinking of the Bitcoin code dying, absolutely. Something can come along and totally kill it, but the ledger itself can live on in an improved code base.
Finally, we already have a digital currency. It's called the US Dollar. Most US Dollars are.... digital!
**tl;dr:** If someone invents better bitcoin that is decentralized and open source, it's far more likely that the ledger will be imported into that system and the old bitcoin code be retired.

Uh, guess what? The 'market' wasn't unregulated in 2008. We didn't have the wild west when it came to regulations. Oh, have you heard about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Who eagerly bought up nonsense mortgages from banks?
Those damn private profit seeking corporations... oh wait... THEY WERE GSE's....
Who else would buy up garbage mortgages? Surly not anyone trying to actually make money. 
Absent the government trying to artificially influence the housing market, none of that shit would have happened. No bank in their right mind is going to make a loan to someone that can't make it back... but they will if they know the government will buy the mortgage off them before the ink is even dry on the contract...


The government isn't magical, just because you want to work it doesn't mean it will, because it's not about being good, it's about generating profit for special interests, and there is a lot of profit to be generated from government power and influence.
Guess what? We already have your 'worst case' scenario. One industry controls the FDA. Not the people. Not the government.

Funny you mention that, the government itself was about to do something quite similar. 


Is it illegal for the natives to use the land productively? I see what happens a lot is where you have area that is a reservation, but then the indians are not allowed to use it at all, especially to grow stuff. So they can't make money off their land. Of course, those rules don't apply to the criminals who come in and murder them all.
And in the case you specified, they can't defend themselves. It's an unfortunate situation but it seems they can't properly defend themselves, and the government doesn't fucking give a shit anyway.
You're living in a fairytale land if you think this will end under ANY system. You're always going to have criminals and corruption, giving them government power will just make it on an even larger scale.

No it doesn't, because you can protect your private property absent government, you contract with someone to help you defend your property. In all liklihood, a lot of people would contract with them and you'd have mutual defense networks.
Sure, they could screw you over, but that would be bad business. 


What's the point of working if you're not allowed to accumulate property, also, don't kid yourself, there will still be private property among the government enforcing itself.

I would guess that 97% of the US Dollars are withheld from circulation (one of our most popular export? $100 bills). If the mood of the holders becomes a little more pessimistic, and they unload only 3% of their holdings, then prices of everything you could possibly buy would skyrocket in price as holders of US currency rush to buy everything they can before the dollar possibly collapses.
If they buy foreign currencies, the exchange rate of the dollar would plummet and the cost of imports would skyrocket. The government would likely try to step in to prevent it, like the Venezuelans did. 
Look at how that worked out for them.
We have hundreds of billions of US dollars held off shore, which are not bidding up prices here. In order to buy oil, countries need... US Dollars. So even if we have NOTHING to do with the production or consumption of that oil.... still need US Dollars.
Imagine if those dollars start coming back here what happens to prices.

You take the Eth codebase, then start a new blockchain where the first blocks credit keys from the unspent outputs on the old Bitcoin ledger. All the advantages of Eth, using the existing Bitcoin ledger. It's Eth code, but it's the bitcoin ledger and not the Eth ledger. **Nothing prevents this.**


There would be a tremendous amount of interest in preserving the current state of the ledger, this is what I feel that you underestimate. The longer the Bitcoin blockchain lasts at high values, the more likely this outcome.
Nothing has truly threatened bitcoin yet, so of course this hasn't happened. 
Basically, you're making the assumption that if we upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, we have to lose all of our files, data, documents, etc...
**Not true.**
In my opinion, the real value of bitcoin comes from the ledger. If I were to take the bitcoin code and make my own ledger, it's worthless even though it uses the same exact code as bitcoin.

You seem to be of the former opinion, the truth is, **you don't have a fucking clue**, and neither do the moonkids. If someone comes to tell me bitcoin will be worth a million dollars per bitcoin, I'm going to tell them put down the pipe.
The truth is likely somewhere in between those two outcomes.

So... why buy it? Why should such a currency exist when you already have US dollars, and again, if you have a currency that forces consumption instead of conservation, isn't that actually bad? It wastes resources. If my currency is going to lose value, and I personally don't have a use for it, so I buy something just to buy something, and not because I actually need it... someone else that actually needs it now may not be able to buy it.
In that case, I may as well just engage in barter, which is less efficient than using money. A bag of rice is a bag of rice. 
What do you propose next? Stop people from hoarding commodities too? I mean, there is precedent for that, governments have tried that with things like toilet paper.
How far are you willing to go with this idiocy?
You've fallen for the whole "spending makes the economy grow" garbage, you have the cart before the horse. You can't consume without production, and you don't have production without saving, or, as you call it, **hoarding*.
I mean, in order to produce all of that wheat, somebody had to save up for that combine harvester. How do they buy that combine harvester if the value of their money always falls? In order to build that skyscraper, somebody has to have saved all of that money to make the loan to build that building...
If everyone is spending money as fast as they get it, there's no savings to borrow from. See Wiemar Republic, where people would get paid at noon and for their lunch break rush to the store to spend all of their money before it lost all of it's value.


Actually, if you had enough money to build a space station, you likely would not be allowed to do it. So, no.

or just use credit cards, debit cards... there's no point to your coin.


Did you forget that during the industrial revolution, we actually used a currency which gained in value... and well, we had... like... an industrial revolution. We built up a lot of capital during that time.
Did you think that perhaps, maybe, all of that capital we built up, helped finance the 20th century?
The trouble is that only lasts so long. Sooner or later that capital dries up.


What stops bandits from buying machine guns today? **Nothing**. People buy illegal things all of the time with cash, the difference is bandits can buy machine guns to go murder people, but law abiding citizens can't buy machine guns.
Besides, if you want go murder people with legal impunity, there's a legal way to do that. Join the largest, most successful, legally protected street gang. They even have gang signs and gang tattoos and their own colors.


You mean like negative interest rates (something you're probably a huge fan of), or in fed, QE infused, stock market bubbles?


Compare purchasing power of the US Dollar between 1800 and 1900, and 1900 and 2000.
Tell me which one is more stable?
In one corner... we have a doubling of value in 100 years. 
In another corner... we have a 90% drop, or more, of value, in 100 years.
That's not stable.

Not at all. Unspent outputs don't take much space, the new chain, or system if it's not quite a chain, would simply have a copy of the old unspent outputs. When you start to use the system, you just sign a message with the address to claim the unspent outputs, and then the chain/system marks those unspent outputs as "claimed" and credits you to the new address.
Timelocks, and other functions, would obviously go out the window if they didn't have a way of replicating it in the new system, but the primary thing people care about is the number of tokens.


Upon further thinking about it, your analogy is probably better.
However, bitcoin tokens are stupidly simple. It's just a number of tokens, which in my opinion, isn't hard to to replicate on a new system. Perhaps, think of them as porting Text files from Windows to Linux.
For your analogy, it would be more like porting Eth functions to a new system, because Eth is far more complicated than just a number of tokens per address. It's far, far more than just a ledger.
This is an advantage for bitcoin, because all Bitcoin is really trying to do is be a ledger, where Eth is trying to be a ledger and a form of a virtual machine.


Mining could be irrelevant in the new system, if someone finds a better way of handling mining that doesn't include Bitcoin ASICS, that doesn't affect transporting the ledger.


Not quite. If a newer currency comes up, remember it's going to have the same TREMENDOUS volatility as Bitcoin did especially at the beginning, there's then also the HUGE problem where if Bitcoin actually does start to look like it's going to fail because of a new coming currency outperforming it... nobody is going to be interested in a newer and improved decentralized currency... because what if that happens all over again in ten years with a 'new' one and all of the value of the tokens disappear?
"I'm not buying SuperCoin! Look at what happened to Bitcoin when SuperCoin came out, the tokens lost all of their value. I'm not taking the risk of buying SuperCoins, and then they come out with SuperDuperCoin and the tokens lose all of their value"
If they try to peg the tokens to fiat currency to prevent this, then it's not truly a decentralized currency either. It has to float on it's own.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:30:10


No, you're talking about a cryptocurrency that is backed by a fiat currency, that will lose enough value in a week for it to be a 'transaction' fee. That's way beyond any inflation. i.e., put in $100 US Dollars into JStolfiCoin, a week later it's not $100 US Dollars anymore. The dollar still inflates in the meantime, and in JStolfiCoin, the value just goes down, never UP, never EVER UP.
Because that's like, bad for the economy... MAN.
The last time the US dollar increased in value in terms of purchasing power was during the industrial revolution, somehow having a currency double in value over a course of 100 (US Dollar during 1800 to 1900) years didn't cause the world to end. It was more of an organic, natural interest rate.
Economy still expanded during those 100 years by an order of magnitude.

Then the shares have no value. What's the point of having shares at all? 
How does the business raise capital? Case in point, they want a new combine harvester. Cost: $300,000.
All of the workers combined don't have the money to buy it.
How do they go about buying it?
They could borrow money... but wait, that goes against private property (because a debt to another person = private property), they can't sell shares... 
And wait, who makes all of that illegal to begin with? A government.
If someone wants to make a loan, and someone is willing to borrow money, it's ridiculous that someone else says that two parties can't do that.

The longer bitcoin is around, the more likely it is that the volatility will eventually die down. The volatility is due to it's future being uncertain. The volatility today is nothing like at the start. A big move is 5-10%, which is shocking compared to the stock market, but a joke compared to 50-80% swings it saw in the early days.


If your currency was pre-programmed to LOSE VALUE, tell me, why would you hold it at all? How do you save up for larger purchases over long periods of time, if you're going to call that 'hoarding' ?
Sorry, people need to be able to hoard, whether you like it or not.
Not only that, but pegging a currency will require a **centralized institution** to hold the currency it is pegged too. I know! Let's have the United States Government do it, surely they could be trusted, right?
Once upon a time, the US Government held Gold in a vault, and gave out 'tokens' called Gold Certificates, that were REDEEMABLE in GOLD on **DEMAND**. You deposit gold, you get certificate. You bring certificate back, you get GOLD.
Now, tell me what happened in 1933, and then in 1971? Right, they re-negged on that whole gold certificate thing.
Any pegged crypto-currency would eventually suffer that same fate. That's one of the points of bitcoin, we can't really trust governments to handle money.
Not to mention, the underlying currency backing the token, can still lose value. See Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic, really, we can go on all day. 


Why buy them at all? Why not just use credit cards?
You've established that:
1. We don't want the value to be volatile.
2. We want to punish people who hoard tokens.
Why not just keep US dollars?


In that world, bitcoin still has a purpose. That's the system we already have, remember, most money is already digital. 
Also, while censoring transactions involving murder for hire, is a good thing, the trouble is the government has used their pressure on institutions to censor transactions which are **legal**, this is illegitimate. They've abused the censoring authority by going too far.
Bitcoin would have no value, and no purpose, if government just focused on the actual bad guys, and people who grow a plant aren't part of those bad guys.
I'd be interested in seeing you make this as an altcoin. Seems like you already have all of the answers.

Nope. Because those investments have something called... **risk**, more risk than just holding US Dollars. You're assuming every investment is going to pay off, that's not true, and then your investments could actually do well... but then something else goes wrong.
Either way, I think that's a much as a currency than something that **falls** 90% in a century. Oh, and I'm sure you're well aware that was the Gold Standard, so technically, the Gold was the currency. We threw that away with predictable results.


I don't hold US dollars.


That's how every investment works, you put money into a venture, and hope to get a return. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. What will be Bitcoins story? Will bitcoin die in a fire? Will it become a currency? A store of value closer to gold?
I don't know, and **neither do you**.
I do know one thing, if governments around the world didn't play games with their currencies and banking systems, bitcoin wouldn't exist in the first place.

I don't know if you know this, but the FDA is bought and quite literally paid for by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Big tobacco buying the FDA and saying cigarettes are safe doesn't mean it's true.
Likewise if the FDA is bought and paid for by big drug companies.

I seriously can't stop giggling about the absurdity of your crypto-currency idea...
"Here, this is a new digital currency system. Buy these tokens and you can use them to make instant payments to anyone!
BUT HURRY, IF YOU DON'T SPEND THEM ALL IN A WEEK THEY WILL FALL IN VALUE!"
That's like the old gift card scams, where you would buy a $50 gift card, and then they'd take it all away in instant inactivity fees.
Which by the way, was made illegal. So that might be an issue with your new JStolfiCoin.
Come to think of it, I think American Express Gift Cards are better than your coin. Those generally are worth the face value.... oh... but criminals use them too. 
Guess they need to be made illegal too.

Nonsense. One of the workers wants to take a valuable machine and go on a demolition derby with it. Who stops him?
A worker wants use a thousand gallons of gasoline to write his name in a field. Who stops him?
Who stops workers from wasting publicly owned resources?
Authority. Government. Central planners.
*Epic fail.*
There's also the flip side. A worker wants to do something productive with publicly owned resources, but is denied.
You can also have unintentional wasteful usage of publicly owned resources, people simply not knowing what they are doing. What if a worker wants to jump in a machine he has no experience working with?
Who stops him? 
Somebody has to.
If someone doesn't know how to fly a helicopter jumps into it... what do you do? Let them kill themselves, others, and damage all sorts of things? Who the hell are you to stop them, they own a piece of that helicopter, don't they? They have just as much right to it as you do, don't they?

People vote with their wallets. People have more control over corporations than governments.
Because corporations have to get your money by convincing you to do business with them.
That's not the case with government. 
Corporations can't go bad without government interfering with the markets in one way or another. Every form of corporate abuse has either been the result of government interference giving them a form of protected status (licensing, medallions, etc), or a failure of government to not enforce laws on them because of favoritism.

No, they don't hold "money". They hold STUFF. The STUFF is worth money, but guess what? If I bought 10 combine harvesters for $350,000 each... I'm worth $3.5 million... right?
How many combine harvesters can I use at once?
Who uses the other 9?
Whenever you see this bullshit figure about how the wealthy hold all of this money, it's bullshit. They hold assets that have market values, not money itself. If you tried to liquidate their stuff to 'feed the poor', you'd first have to sell everything for pennies on the dollar. (if you're confiscating everything from the rich, rich people aren't going to be able to buy them for what the assets are worth).
You take my 10 combine harvesters, liquidate them, and I have to fire 9 employees because they no longer have a harvester.
There was a country that tried this. It was called Zimbabwe. It didn't work. See the ONE HUNDRED TRILLION DOLLAR note.
The soviet union had a similar problem. They had the harvesters, but they sat in empty fields. No fuel for them.

I didn't get those shares for free, for nothing. The company sold stock to fund a project. I bought it. They turned it into production.
That's the same as me buying an item, turning it into something else more valuable.
Now, maybe I bought the shares from someone who actually invested early. Maybe I didn't directly invest, well, if I can't buy his shares after he invested into it, his shares are worthless.

From the SEC's point of view:
1. Approve Bitcoin ETF, investment more accessible, people rush in, bitcoin dies in a fire due to some problem. SEC gets hauled into congress HOW COULD YOU APPROVE THIS YOU IDIOTS.
2. Disapprove bitcoin ETF, bitcoin chugs on for another 10 years, nothing bad happens... price maybe goes bazooka or just remains stable... they can always approve an ETF later.
The primary job of the SEC is to protect investors from making too much money. You couldn't buy facebook stock as a commoner until it's value was already realized, thanks to the SEC.
It's the same concept as the FDA:
1. Approve drug, turns out the drug is bad, kills people, get hauled into congress.

Here's how to make a decentralized bitreserve.
Step 1: Send bitcoins to exchange.
Step 2: Sell bitcoins for currency.
Step 3: Send currency to your bank.
Step 4 (Optional): Withdraw all money from bank and keep 100% reserve (something Bitreserve doesn't even do!)
Now, when you want the bitcoins back:
Step 1: Send money to exchange.
Step 2: Trade money for bitcoin.
Step 3: Send bitcoin to your bitcoin wallet.
Because that's all that "Bitreserve" does. You 'lock' in the value of your bitcoins by... *selling*.
Bitreserve hopes to do this process and then earn a return on **your money**, just like a bank. They sell your bitcoins, invest the proceeds, hoping for a return.
Guess what happens if they invest unwisely...

As most criminal law does.
However, they will still simply seize your money, and just never charge you with a crime. They charge the money itself with the 'crime'.
Good luck getting the money back.
It's kind of like if you were one day driving your car, and got pulled over, the cops seize the car.
Because it's possible you could have been on your way to commit a crime with the car. However, since you haven't committed a crime yet, they can't charge you or arrest you for that non-existent crime.
But they can still take the car, sell it at auction (leaving you with the remaining car payments too, by the way), and pocket all of the proceeds.
You can try to get the car back through the courts, but it will likely exceed the cost of the car. Not worth spending $15,000 in legal fees to get back a $10,000 car... or even a $25,000 car. You could spend the money and still **lose**, so even more in the hole.

You can still be busted even if you were not trying to avoid the reporting requirements, the deposits just have to equal over $10k in a certain period of time and they will accuse you of structuring. It could be depositing $9000/week, which just so happens to be your weekly revenue, or perhaps your insurance company doesn't insure over $10,000 cash bags, so you always deposit under $10,000 to ensure coverage.
It could even be $2,500 a week.

@_date: 2015-07-23 20:59:32


You don't sell bitcoins, take the cash, and hold the cash in 100% reserve in a secure vault (because this is actually illegal).
Therefore, you are operating under fractional reserves. You may have 'assets' that are equal to 100% or more of the deposits, but these asset values can change quite drastically, especially during a financial crisis. You're dependent on third parties, there may be legal complications in the future with your business model as well.
Which means there's a real risk that when it comes down to it, people won't be able to get their bitcoins out, or at least the same USD value of them when they need them.
So, the most risk adverse way to handle this, is to simply dump your stash of bitcoins and keep the cash until you're ready to get back in.
The other thing is, if someone thinks bitcoin is going to succeed and have a high price for the tokens, they'd be an idiot to deposit bitcoins into your system, because if they are right, they are only going to get the USD value back.

@_date: 2015-07-23 04:45:26


This isn't true, the amount of services and goods can be represented by **anything**.
It's not the amount of money in the system that matters, it's the amount of STUFF and SERVICES. If you have a monetary system with a fixed amount of units, those units will always be divided up against all available products/services.
The more stuff, more services, prices fall. If one part of the economy has a disaster which limits the amount of stuff, prices rise.
Nobody actually wants the money, they want the stuff.

Except they can effectively 'freeze' an account, by not allowing it to ever be transferred again, or only allowing it to be transferred to themselves, and likely, the bank or entity would have the ability to transfer stuff without the consent of the owner.

People buy computers because the money it costs them for the computer, is less desirable than the computer at that point in time.
The same goes for everything.
Why buy a new luxury car, when a cheap new car gets the job done just as well?
Because internally, in their mind, they value the money less than the car right now.
Some people will have different preferences.
A fixed money supply will have no bearing on individual preferences, especially when the difference is only going to be a few minor percentage points in terms of price, unless they want to wait ten years. The economy as a whole isn't going to expand 20-30% a year which is required for the purchasing power of the currency to increase that much.
And nobody is going to hold off on a purchase they want for ten years when they can afford it now. They could be dead in ten years.
Essentially the 'deflation' is going to be akin to a reverse of inflation, rather than your wages lagging behind inflation with rising prices, your wages will lag behind the deflation, with falling prices.
However, your purchasing power will at worst stay the same (with saved money increasing in purchasing power), and at best, act as a natural wage raise. Being able to buy more stuff with the same amount of money is effectively a raise.

@_date: 2017-04-23 18:08:56


Not yet.
If you escape Bitfinex and pay $1350 for your BTC, an immediate loss of $100+ to cash out to USD is a tough instant loss.
But... the Bitfinex price keeps rising and the other exchanges rise too.
You might try to cut your losses by waiting for the real price of bitcoin to be the same as you paid. Especially if you see price rising fairly quickly.
Once people realize this pump isn't real, things will get toasty. We can see this with increasing spreads.

That's why nobody invests in computer technology anymore. Computers always get cheaper and cheaper. It's why hard drive technology has been stagnant for decades.
Not just that but look at the flat screen tvs, they're $10,000 like when they first came out. Really only a toy for the rich. There's no intention to invest to make them more economically so that more people can afford them, because they rather be able to sell them for $10,000.
Why make it so you have to sell them for $1,000 when you can sell them for $10,000?
And don't even get me started on cell phone technology. Stagnant for decades. $9,000 for the phone and $1,200 monthly bills? Yeah. No point in spending money on upgrading the technology because they will make less money.

You can dump the private keys from bitcoin core and import them into another wallet, like Electrum which is what I use.
If you intend to sell your bitcoins and actually get the money to your bank, make sure to do it on an exchange you can get the money to your account, that means don't try and sell on Bitfinex or Poloniex.

I would.
You could always just sell half and then you win either way. You can always get back in, too.
I don't think Bitcoin will go to $10,000 until we have scaling in place and functional and the eternal banking problems resolved permanently by larger institutions getting in on the game.
Look at how SegWit signaling is working out for Litecoin, the main pools are alternating between signaling and not signaling causing wide changes in the price. The same will happen to bitcoin most likely.
Think of it this way, how much do you miss out on if you're wrong and it goes down a whole bunch? Kind of like having a winning lottery ticket and not redeeming it in time. 
If you're sitting on a life changing amount of money, you can't lose either by selling half.

The bitcoin crash to around $900 mid-march, then people started doing withdrawals from the Bitfinex exchange. All of these wires were returned to Bitfinex and Bitfinex cannot send the wires out.

When Bill was bashing bitcoin, I actually engaged him on it.
His primary argument against it was the fact that bitcoin was 'deflationary', but he had other oppositions to it, the other big one being the fact that it wasn't created by congress, and only 'the government' should create currency. I actually told him someone could create a version of bitcoin that follows his own ideals, slightly inflationary, I also explained that bitcoins, or any altcoin, are not created out of debt.
Anyway, he was very staunch of his position... he wouldn't budge. BITCOIN! BAD! CRYPTOCURRENCY! BAD! 
At least until someone offers him what was eventually worth about $100k-$200k of 'quarks' and then he magically changes his mind. I was watching his address and he sold about $50k worth, I eventually stopped watching so he perhaps could have sold more, but at least $50k for sure.
He accused me of being a shill for bitcoin, only caring about pumping and dumping... well here we are few years later.

A short position is where you borrow bitcoins, sell them, and hope to buy them back cheaper to make money.
If the price of bitcoin goes up, you're losing money, and it gets ever more stressful when you leave the short open in a losing position and then bitcoin goes up even more, and you don't know if it's going to dump... or go up a ton.
So you could theorize that someone maybe has a large short position, it goes against him, and it's cheaper to try and spam attack the network and spam a bunch of fud trolls on reddit and maybe even pay off a few bloggers to make people panic dump. "omg no bitcoin is dying!"
This can be done in reverse with longs, borrow dollars, buy bitcoins, hope they go up, don't spam attack network, have bunch of redditrolls posting positive news and posts...

It's not going to be anything of the sort, because if they make a real digital currency, and every unit represents 1 USD/EUR etc, people could send massives amounts of money electronically without any real oversight, as all they have to do is transfer the token.
You could do this with a centrally controlled chain, someone gives you a token key, you send the token key to the bank, the bank then re-assigns you (without any additional information other than a key), a new token in the same amount to take 'ownership' of the tokens (and to prevent a double spend).
To spend bitcoin, you simply provide a valid key, send transaction to a new key you control, money spent. Nothing else.
NO BANK IS GOING TO DO THAT, and to do this on a 'blockchain' for a bank, again, is pointless. They could run an internal ledger than would do the same thing as bitcoin that would run circles around bitcoin in terms of performance, **but they are not going to do this, because laws.**
@_date: 2016-10-03 22:33:42
They can't, no bank right now can legally make a digital token that is as interchangeable as bitcoins are. 
The minute they do, anyone could then create a purely digital exchange of those bank tokens to bitcoin, **or anything else**. They would not have to interface with the banking system except as a 'token holder'.
Secondly, they're not going to create a token system that they can't decide "YOU HAVE TOO MANY TOKENS, FROZEN".
The whole 'bankchain blockchain' is pointless, because everyone would still need to be 'verified', have a bank account, and can be locked out at any time for any reason, legitimate or not. They're not going to make digital bearer notes like cash.

Bitcoins can be used to put information in a digital ledger that sits on every bitcoin node and can't be tampered with by anyone or anything no matter how hard you try.
If you want to encode information on this chain, you need bitcoins, albeit you only need a small amount.
Also, value is subjective. One reason why gold made a good money, it's pretty, and it's rare.

But yeah, in my opinion, if someone creates a revolutionary altcoin, they will be able to make their software, have their own coin, and the market will decide the value of them.
If their shit works, then the coins will have value.
They won't need to 'presale' the coins to 'get development' up and running. They'll develop it, hold onto a stash of coins and develop the value of them.
If they create value, their stash will increase in value.

Then imagine the horror that perhaps their 'investments' don't do as well as they thought, and it turns out that they have less in reserves. Perhaps the stock market bull run ends and tanks, and, oops, their portfolio is down 30%, and bitcoin is up 20-30% during the ensuing panic.
So not only are you out the appreciation of bitcoin, but now face losses due to their speculation.
But what if bitcoin crashes and goes down (as it has in the past 2 years), well, pumpkin, SELL THE DAMN BITCOINS YOURSELF, TAKE CASH, PUT IT IN SOMETHING ELSE YOURSELF. When you're ready to get back into bitcoins, simply buy them back.
Because you'll have more control of your money that way, than trusting 'Bitreserve'... er I mean 'uphold'.

Pay attention to the nose scratching after he talks.


Among the most common signs of lying is the nose touch. It seems that the nose touch is connected to the original mouth covering gesture that is so obvious in children. Because adults are more conscious about body signs that they are displaying, the hand is quickly pulled away from the mouth, which results in a quick nose touching gesture.

If bitcoin reaches, the 10k mark, which I see as a distinct possibility, or I would not have taken such a risk - I plan on moving to the west coast and getting away from all the angry people here where I currently reside.

Bitcoin is a speculation. Investing would be like buying shares of coinbase (if you could even do that), hoping they'll turn a profit and pay dividends.
You're buying bitcoins specifically because you think they will go up in value, bitcoins aren't a company, so it's speculating on a commodity.
Just like gold or silver or oil or oranges.

Tell me, how do you propose 'we' get women involved?
Nothing is stopping them from getting involved. There are no gatekeepers saying "OH, YOU HAVE A VAGINA, YOU CANT LEARN OR PLAY WITH BITCOIN".
So if women aren't all into something like bitcoin, it's because they're just not interested in it.
It's geeky and not all women are technogeeks.
The irony though is pretty funny, since back in the past all of the geeks were women, since it was not considered 'manly' to be on computer/typewriter all day. That was a job for girls. 
Nothing more funny than running into a retired woman that knows assembly. "WWWW TTTTT FFFF"

@_date: 2015-10-14 15:45:08
The real funny part of the scam, imagine the scenario where they are right, and bitcoin does go to zero.
People deposit bitcoins, on the back-end, they sell them and take the USD proceeds. They use these USD proceeds to fund their startup, invest, speculate, whatever, so in reality they are holding zero bitcoins (why would you hold something you believe will lose all of its value?)
While people have their savings stored in "Bitreserve' and think they have their accounts value 'locked in'... bitcoin dies.
Bitreserve then turns around and claim that those accounts were 'denominated in bitcoin', and therefore, the account owner is entitled to 'bitcoin', which is now 'defunct' and is worth $0.
Maybe that was their whole idea from the start, use the bitcoin bubble to create their company and hope that bitcoin fails so they don't have to pay anyone back.
They spelled their name backwards, It's holdup.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:09:08
Probably. They deposit cash, then go back to the teller with the receipt for the deposit that they made a 'mistake' once they have bitcoins in hand.
A dumb teller/manager may allow them to reclaim the money.
@_date: 2015-10-23 01:24:30
@_date: 2015-02-19 05:40:53
Looks like the price is still over $1.52 so I think I'm okay.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:28:04
Actually if an exchange can't survive a 'bank run', then it's operating incorrectly. If they want to 'borrow' bitcoins for which to speculate with, they can simply issue time lock deposits, and you can't withdraw these bitcoins for a period of time.
So if you use these time locked deposit, you know your bitcoins are not immediately available. 
Though they will have to compensate you somehow with that with something called an interest rate.

What about preserving wealth?
Theres a lot of things you can buy to preserve wealth, but can you think of something more portable and seizure proof than bitcoin?
If you buy foreign currency, they can use it.
If you buy gold, they can use it.
If you buy real estate, they can use it.
If you buy bitcoin and properly secure it... even if they catch you... they can't use it if they can't figure out your keys, and you can hold bitcoin without it being on your person. You may be even able to use it as a bargaining chip for freedom, unlike other forms of wealth which they can immediately seize and make use of.
Remember that not all governments are benevolent, they may wish to use money taken from the citizens to destroy wealth at the benefit of special interests.
Bitcoin makes capital controls much harder, and that's a good thing. 
Bitcoin will have value as long as people think it has value, just like the US dollar. In reality, all money value is an illusion.

Of course they do.
Who should I believe? Exchanges which are known for wash trading, running volumizers, other gimmicks and nonsense... and are currently being investigated by PBoC...
Or... PBoC ?
That's like me going to the defense attorney of a defendant currently under investigation, "Hey, did X do Y? Oh... no! He's innocent!"
It made no sense for them to disable bitcoin withdrawals, because any bitcoins that were on their platform still, were obviously not actually being used for "capital flight", as anyone engaging in "capital flight" via bitcoin isn't going to leave their bought bitcoins on the exchange in the first place.
There's only one reason to disable bitcoin withdrawals. **Solvency problems.**

So essentially Bitreserve only exists to get control of peoples money. 
"Hey! Send us your bitcoins, we'll dump them on the market and give you IOU's for whatever you want! We promise we won't rip you off!"

You make a great point there, but we're faced with trusting two liars. So it's a question of which liars I trust more.


No, but if one exchange halts withdrawals and claim it's PBoC, it's not a stretch that the other exchanges think's the government wants that and follows suit even though they are not insolvent.
Also, did the government announce the investigations are over? If not, why are they suddenly re-enabling withdrawals while still 'under investigation'?


They could simply suspend trading and only allow withdrawals. No new activity could take place.

Right here, from the PBOC.
Also, cointelegraph is an amusing source. Advertising for Bitcoin Casinos. Legit news site. 


Because one exchange halts withdrawals due to "PBOC investigation", the others then falsely believe they should halt withdrawals due to PBOC, despite no requirement to halt withdrawals.
It also gave all exchange owners the ability to acquire bitcoins at a steep discount.

Not if the price was being goosed up by them, or known parties in the first place. If you know the price is being manipulated upwards, and you know when they are going to stop, you can trade on that info and make a fortune.

They can still sell the BTC on other exchanges, let the price tank, then buy them back cheaper when you want to withdraw or sell. 
They could just give you the difference too. Sell your bitcoin from under you @ 2900, price tanks, btc price now $2600, you decide to sell your already done and sold BTC... then just give you the difference and pocket the $300.
In the event you withdraw, they just buy the BTC on your behalf... and pocket the difference.
They can't lose.

Why does that imply government action? There's all sorts of threats that can be done to coerce exchanges into compliance even if the government doesn't do it themselves.

I'm not speaking of Eth, specifically, no.
However, Eth is innovative, but risky, and ultimately due to the whole forking nonsense because someone wrote a buggy contract, I feel that the project is doomed.
Forks are for problems in the underlying protocol, there were no issues in the underlying protocol for Eth. It executed a contract as it was told to execute it, but since the eth devs were heavily invested into The DAO, they fork to undo the 'hack'.... which is an epic failure in my opinion. 
I don't consider it to have been a hack, since they are trying to get the idea of "CODE = LAW", well, you better damn well make sure you dot your I's and cross your T's.

If you know you're insolvent, it's a good cover to use. If you randomly stop withdrawals for no reason the first thing people think of, is insolvency.
But the PBOC 'investigation' provides a cover to halt withdrawals. Claim you're halting withdrawals because of the investigation, instead of because you realized bitcoins are missing from your wallets.
It gives you time to acquire bitcoins through other means to shore up your reserves, also for a while Bitcoins sold for a significant discount on their exchange. They could have been internally arbitraging in order to shore up their wallets. Since people could not withdraw, they were forced to sell at a massive discount in order to get anything.


Except the PBOC never told them to halt withdrawals. There's no reason to disable them.


Bad things happen every time withdrawals get halted from any exchange, and everyone wants to think "Oh, this time, it's different!"
