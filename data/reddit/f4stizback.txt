This is a great way to remove even more bitcoin from the market that won't even be used again!

Pretty typical. The older generation doesn't want change. They want everything to be how it was in their "hay days". News flash, it's almost 2015, BTC may very well be the future.

We all complain about how this sub reddit is a circle jerk but right now I'm honestly enjoying it haha.

I lost a few BTC, they refunded after I provided proof that I'm the owner of my account. Never used since.

If you can't afford it, don't buy it. Simple as that.

Lawl. This is crazy.

Theoretically yes, but finding merchants that accept btc? Might be a little tricky depending where you are located.

Like everything else said try using a different cable. If your port is broken don't worry, it can easily be fixed by someone who knows how to solder.

I don't think it really matters if you think it's a sport or not.Because it's a multimillion dollar industry. Getting paid to play video games? Its pretty hard to beat that in my book.

I always watch out for fake bills. Considering in today's day and age you can get them delivered to you door for a fraction of what they're worth. EX; $5 for a fake $20.

Even though this is obviously a joke he technically funded a terrorist org. Whether they will except the tip or not? Highly unlikely, I wonder if this guy would've done it if ISIS beheading someone of his family? Fuck this guy.

Congrats on reaching 11btc, but for your coins safety I wouldn't publicly announce how many coins you have. It just paints a red target on your back for people out to steal btc. Because people who go through extreme lengths to get money whether it is to hack into your computer or rob you in person. Be careful out there fellow redditors.

Shit man gambling was how I got my first btc on a mine craft server. Ever since then I rarely gamble since odds are almost always against you.

Hi, with the help of the reddit army bitcoin shall reach the moon and beyond! Interstellar currency?:O

Wow I know where I'm going to go next time I'm in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.

Be careful of those apps. You will need a large sum of money to be able to make anything worth bragging about. Not to mention their fees are usually outragous. As for your question about coinbase, I've never used them through a app like that.

Alright, thanks for the replies everyone! I really appreciate it!
