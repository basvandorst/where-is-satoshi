We all know who Roger Ver really is, actually I am 100% disgusted with that shitty marketing they use on a that FAILED campaign trying turn the BCASH community against BITCOIN. If it wasn't for that everybody would be helping each other, like the rest of the Crypto Community does. Thats the blockchain community spirit, when we find a down side, we gatter and we TOGETHER make the changing happens. 
Its like, BCASH is against everybody else that doesn't support it yet, but they only have adoption from those idiots that probably spent tons of money hopping that Roger was right and now they are frustated and broke given up on BTC.
I can't believe that someidiots actually supports that kind of activity. 
It's just like many companies that are dead now because they tried to damage their competitors image, like PEPSI for example, most of PPL only drink it when they can't have coke. And that's the BCASH best case scenario, because PEPSI actually turns out to be a large company.

I'm new HERE but not new in the Crypto world. With that said, I think you are twisting the justification used back then and the reasons for not incresing the block size at that moment. But this is not even the case, because I agree that BCH main intention was a great one but their team still does a terrible job when their marketing is 100% about trying to put their followers against everybody that supports BTC. I never said that BCH idea was bad, but I decided not to support them under these circunstances. 
I see hundreds of threads here trying to impose that if you stick to BTC your picked their side or vice-versa, such a thing is ridiculous, I don't have to hate anything or anyone just because I hold BTC.
