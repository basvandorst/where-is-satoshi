Yes. Our company has an investment portfolio, whatever money we save at the end of each month, we use it to buy crypto and then use the profits to give our employees bonuses quarterly to keep them happy. It's day 24 today and still no deposit.

Still no response from Kraken. I just have to sit here for weeks and be at their mercy co Stanton checking my email and account. It shouldn't be like this.

Best of luck bro. Let me know when the funds come in. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:44:11
Oh wow! This is very insightful. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:20:46
How has it been addressed, if it has been 4 weeks since you received my bank wire, and I have not received a deposit?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:33:20
You guys are awesome thank you for your support. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:36:37
Thank you Headspacer, you put my mind at ease. I hope Kraken see this post and responds.

19th day and no response nor deposit to ticket 942469
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:02:39
I hope they solve it for you. It's now 19th day for me and no deposit.

No response from Kraken today and no deposit made yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:53:08
Thanks brother. I did that too several times, but no results. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:51:58
I sent them two separate wires 2 days apart which I have done in the past without any issues. Thanks for your response. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:58
Thanks for your support. They keep saying they are working on it. Quadrigacx is so much better if you are like me, working with Canadian dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:57:53
I sent them 2 wires 2 days apart which I have done in the past without any issues and yes I filled out all the information including my KRAKEN ID like I always did before. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:23:16
Hey bro. I wired $200,000 Canadian to them on November 27th and still no deposit. Any advise for me? I sent two wires of $100k each a few days apart and the bank confirmed that Kraken received it. I have a support ticket open with Kraken but nothing seems to be moving, I even made posts on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:09:53
Today is Wednesday and I still have not heard anything from Kraken. No deposit, No response. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:33:47
Thank you for your encouraging and insightful words. Point noted!
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:56
Why not? It's a ticket number, not a drivers license or SIN number. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:02:45
No response from Kraken
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:14:17
Yes I posted this again since Reddit does not allow changing the title. I realized the title of my first post may have been too harsh, and that I should give them the benefit of doubt for at least another week. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:48:08
Lol. This is epic! Great job on your post. Love it!
Especially 'Step 2'. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:46:55
No response nor a deposit
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:26:18
Matter has not been addressed, today is day # 19 and I have not deposit or response from Kraken. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:57:32
I wired from my Canadian bank account and yes I included my unique identifier in the wire. No money, no email, no nothing. What do you recommend I do?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:23:39
Why not?
