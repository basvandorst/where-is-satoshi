Cool beans.  If you fond pools confusing just think of it like this:  You can choose to buy a lottery ticket yourself and if you win you get to keep all the winnings.  You could also join a lottery pool in the office where if your group wins, you get a percentage of the winnings based on how many people are in the pool.  The same thing happens in Bitcoin, basically.

That’s about right.  The better your hardware, the more you’re able to make per day.  If you want to squeeze an extra few hashes you may want to look into over clocking your GPU but do be honest I don’t know if the extra oomph is worth lowering your card’s life expectancy.
For the record: nicehash actually mines all sorts of other altcoins, but pays you out in Bitcoin.  Perfectly awesome for a home PC.  Go buy a couple of 1080Tis and watch them pay themselves off in mining profits within 6 months. :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:37:44
With a GPU you can make a lot more money by running a program that automatically mines altcoins and then auto-exchanges them to Bitcoin for you.  Free electricity or not, your PC can be earning you more money.  It’s not hard to set up either.

AwesomeMiner + MiningPoolHub.  There is a guide to setting them up which is easy enough to find through Google. I’m currently set up with that on my PC. Bonus is you can choose what coin to be paid out in. More options than just BTC.

I believe that would be the original transaction.  He paid you the coin you mentioned, and the rest of the money in his address went to a “change address” which would still be in his control.

Either that or there’s a subset of the community there who are sick of the “BCH is the real Bitcoin” rhetoric being thrown around as a response to any and every criticism and mods are letting that slide.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:24:43
There are posts that reference BTC and it BCH, but there is obviously a BCH slant in the comments because the vast majority of the user base are BCH people.  If many of us were to post/comment in there more regularly (and I don’t mean slinging insults, I mean actual conversation), I think it would help balance out some of the BCH cultism in there in the end.

Oh hey I do agree with you on this point, but there's a subtle difference between researching something, and researching the _history_ of said thing.  To use your AOL analogy, do you feel it was necessary for you to trace back their origins to the C=64 and Q-Link in order to use their PC-based internet service?  or do you just need to know that CD + Modem = Internet and go from there?  That more closely maps to the original intent of what I said before.

r/btc is censorship-free so perhaps having an upvoted daily reminder of what is what could help newbies ensure they’re choosing the option that’s right for them.
The FAQ sticky does explain it well, but a stickied post with a title saying r/Bitcoin = BTC would be better to let the newbie decide for themselves which coin they prefer.
Edit: Sorry, I guess I should have used quotes for “censorship-free” as I haven’t personally been banned but if some of you were then yeah that would be hypocritical of them.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:12:11
So the ISP is free?  Your phone data plan is free?  You invested money, just in a bunch of different communication protocols that aren’t Bitcoin. Question is should you be expected to do that research to be a consumer? If BTC reaches the point where mass-adoption has taken place and it’s used in lieu of fiat for payments across the globe, I would argue that research shouldn’t be necessary and it will be as transparent as SMTP, HTTP/FTP, GSM/GPRS are to us today.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:12:31

@_date: 2019-07-21 16:39:41


BCH itself isn't a scam.  BCH is simply another Bitcoin fork aimed at the resolution of the transaction throughput issue in a way that Satoshi once mentioned it could be done.
Roger Ver on the other hand is the scam artist.  His attitude and marketing tactics are reprehensible and absolutely deserve all the vitriol we throw at him.  If he had just said "I'm going to create my own fork, with blackjack and hookers!" and started an altcoin the same way thousands of others have, we wouldn't be in the mess we are.
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:00:05
They tout r/btc as being a censorship-free forum to discuss core and cash.  To their credit, that is laid out pretty well in the FAQ sticky.
That said, the common response to “Hey, isn’t this a little deceptive and confusing to newbies?” Seems to be “they should do their research and learn the history of the coin!”.  
My answer to that is no. Just no.  New people to the space just care about buying some of that Bitcoin they heard about on the news with the BTC ticker symbol.  No one needs or is expected to read up on the history of the US Dollar just to withdraw some cash to spend at the corner store.  That’s ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:44

Mining Bitcoin specifically requires ASICs now to do at any sort of profit margin when factoring in electricity costs etc.  ASICs are very loud and produce a lot of heat.  Usually not something that people can just do from their homes relatively easily.
Also, ASIC manufacturers have limited supply which usually gets bought within hours/days depending on which batch in the current generation it is.  Obviously first batch of next-gen ASICs sell out super quick since that is the time in which the units would be the most profitable.

If you were buying from Canadian online exchanges, you'd be jumping through those hoops anyway.  From my experience a year ago I had to provide ID in order to verify my account, then had to provide ID to the 3rd party payment processor that I paid from my bank account to the exchange.
I think that exchanges were going above and beyond when it came to KYC rules because they wanted to play nice with gov't if (and let's face it, when) this sort of law came about.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:52:28
In my example though, each "throwaway" account would be defined by a unique telephone number that would have to be valid in order to handle the SMS verification.  This would be a lot more of a pain to set up than 1000 gmail addresses for example, and would be tied to an account, therefore a name and address etc.
I suppose the possibility exists for someone to buy a whole bunch of pre-paid phones and plans to deposit/withdraw money in $x increments, but if the limit is set to $300/day per account for example, would this not work out to be more trouble than it's worth for someone trying to launder money through this system?
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:49:15
Personally I won't even combat it anymore. 
I've spoken about it in the past with family and friends a couple of years ago, most of them were negative about it. (Scam, not going anywhere, fake nerd money, can't buy groceries, etc.)  I tried to reason and explain the benefits but I found that the people who were negative against it already had a decision made in their head. No amount of talking was going to change that.
Instead, I started shrugging my shoulders and saying "Ok. I guess there's good and bad in everything" and end the conversation there.  Bitcoin has hit a stride now, and I believe that in time when the technology makes it simple enough, my family and friends are going to end up integrating it into their lives anyway because it'll be widely adopted and useful for everything.
It was like me as a teenager trying to describe the benefits of the internet and email in the early 90s. They didn't get it then, either. History is repeating itself.

If this was a year ago I'd agree with that statement.  Thankfully I think that at this point it would be trivial for services running through gox to move elsewhere.
It would create temporary havoc should gox go down for the count for sure, but I don't believe it would destroy the market outright.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:57:40
What if you were to exchange $20 for a fancy peice of paper with a QR code on it?  Call it "art" ;)
Kidding aside though, would the gov't be satisfied with a tiered system?  For example a user provides only SMS verification to create an account but then has daily deposit/withdrawl limits within the boundaries of AML laws?  If the user then proceeds with a "full" account set up, then those limits increase?

@_date: 2014-03-25 17:34:03
*Is* it what you just said?  If so, you were quite vague.
My interpretation was that the guy who recieved the paper wallet would trust that no one else has previously seen the wallet and/or taken a picture to sweep later on.  It was not, however, clear that you meant the *previous owner* of the wallet would sweep the funds back if he suspected it was thrown out, or lost etc.  
That is the point I was clarifying before you decided to get all snarky.
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:24:44
That's my belief as well.  I guess the exchanges will eventually have to conform to AML/KYC laws like any other exchange.
I also hope that it will give those businesses more legitimacy, and allow banks to loosen their collars a bit on accounts that deal with these exchanges, allowing people to freely invest/purchase Bitcoin without fear that they'll have their accounts shut down.
Regulation in moderation isn't a bad thing.  Regulating the exchange to/from CAD is something that wouldn't surprise me at all.
@_date: 2014-08-01 02:59:35
I hope you're wrong too.  What we need to do (I'm Canadian) is ensure that the people making the important decisions understand how crypto works so that they can be aware of how fruitless over-regulation is.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:33:29
Well you probably would want to sweep it anyway.  It's possible that after a set period of inactivity, the original owner may decide to sweep it back.  No way for the owner to know if the paper was thrown out, lost, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:31:13
Agreed and I believe this is one of the major factors holding Bitcoin back.  
In order to help ease the transition to a digital currency like Bitcoin, a system needs to be put in place that will closely resemble the way in which people are interacting with merchants today.  As time goes on these people can be nudged into newer systems that are more efficient, especially as technology advances.
Either PoS systems have to accomodate the flow of a Bitcoin transaction via QR code or NFC, or a physical card should be accessible with a chip and PIN system (like current CC/Debit cards today) that uses an accounts public key for payments instead.
Technology will eventually get to the point that all of this is effortless, but until then we can't expect the average Joe to make use of it. (Like e-mail in the early nineties, for example)

My advice:  If you didn't over-invest and don't mind letting the funds ride, I say take the gamble.  We've just gone through a year-long bear market and that's turned around nicely in the past month.  I think the majority of us expect to see it continue to rise (over the long term!) and eventually surpass the ATH.  How long that will take is a mystery of course.
If you did over-invest and you have debts to pay or you're losing sleep over the market woes, then cash out now.  No harm in that either.  Our health should always some before our wealth.

I got into it in 2011 when I built a new gaming PC and wanted to test my overclock stability so asked someone what software they use to do a proper burn-in test.  Someone suggested Bitcoin mining so I did.  At first I had no idea what it was all about but as I researched further I realized there was something seriously awesome in it, so I kept mining for quite a while!  I don't have serious coin or anything, but considering what I do own was all thanks to my computer doing some work for a while back in 2011/2012, I'm quite happy. :)

The current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol limits the supply to 21m coins.  That said, it's not impossible that at some future date, someone could convince the masses that perhaps 42 million is a better number. After all, 42 IS the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
If this person does happen to be a hoopy frood who definitely knows where his towel is, he could very well convince the majority of miners / full nodes to switch to this new implementation.
Do I see this happening?  Nope.  COULD it happen though?  Yeah.  The deal is, it relies on the majority of the populace to agree on the change.  No one individual can impose a change like that.

I have friends who thought I was a complete moron for NOT selling my Bitcoin when the price hit a whopping $200. They said I was wasting an amazing opportunity to buy a sweet gaming PC for essentially free.  
Honestly, if the thought of losing all your Bitcoin investment gives you that ill feeling in the pit of your stomach, sell.  If you don't need the money and don't really care in the grand scheme of things if it falls to $0, then leave it in.
No one can predict the future, but the world seems to be coming around to the idea of Bitcoin being a safe bet.
Edited to add:  You could also cash in your initial investment and let the profit ride. The absolute worst you could do is break even in that case.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:39:55
People have been asking this question since 2011.  Bitcoin "levelled out" at $1, $10, $200, $1000, etc... 
Historically speaking, since we're sitting at all-time high levels right now, that means it has always been a good time to buy Bitcoin.
Edit: since you're asking about other cryptos as well, I do believe that spreading out the investment is a good idea.  Find some alts to sink a little of your funds into.  Like a 70/30% split between Bitcoin and alts .  Get some Litecoin in there, maybe some ripple, maybe some super cheap niche coin like Siacoin.  Do your research and go with the projects that resonate with you.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:37:40
That depends. What are your goals?  If you bought in with the intent to make $100+ and cash out, then congrats go for it.  If the money you invested was an amount you can afford to lose, I highly suggest keeping your funds in for the long haul (as in 3+ years) when it's quite possible you'll see a much, much greater return than the $100+ you have today
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:11:13

Ethereum has proven itself well, I personally don't have enough insight in it to be able to give any clear guidance, but I do believe it has it's place in a balanced portfolio for sure.
Also looking at something like Monero would be good as well.  It focuses on improved anonymity and has been doing quite well for itself.  Litecoin also has anonymity improvements on its road map so that's promising as well (it's been on quite the upward tear over the past 24-48 hours, too).

Well that's a valid point, but I don't see it as being a hinderance, necessarily.  If they want to protect their profit, they would simply exchange bitcoin for other currency immediately after the transaction is confirmed.
For example: A porn site offers a 6-month subscription to their site for a certain amount of BTC (which wil vary according to real-time BTC/USD conversion rate).  They use the MtGox API to transfer the BTC to USD immediately after the (confirmed) sale.  Even if the value of BTC were to drop in that short timeframe (due to high volatility), it wouldn't matter much, since their service is offering a digital product, which costs pennies on the dollar to distribute.
In other circles, for example the sex-toy market, the mark-up may be smaller, resulting in slightly less profit for the company, but if they automate the BTC/USD conversion, they'd likely still profit.  
In both cases, factor in the concept of attracting more sales due to complete anonymity, and they could potentially do more business than before.  Which in turn means more $$.

So let's say you are selling something and you want "Bitcoin" (BCH) for it to help spread adoption and awareness.  The buyer then goes out and gets "Bitcoin" (BTC) and sends it to your address.
That's why people care.  Joe Blow won't know or care about the history of the BCH fork, they just want to buy your used video card.  Just getting started in payments using cryptocurrency is already a confusing issue for most (non-technical) people.  Why confuse them further by calling 2 distinct currencies by the same name?
@_date: 2011-10-19 04:59:51
True, but I would consider that your statement applies mainly to commodities that people wouldn't consider taboo. If I were a cheating husband, for example, I'd likely take the risk in my $10USD in BTC to purchase a $9 subscription to Ashleymadison for 1 month, knowing that even if my extra $1 is lost, will be worth the trouble of not haing my wife find out.
The same concept could apply to anyone else who just wants to retain that level of anonymity. Consider it a premium vs. a loss of funds.

I'd rather do the exact opposite.  Shapeshift your alts to BTC before the split (to a personal wallet), so when the split occurs you're maximizing the amount of duplicated tokens you receive.  afterwards you can do whatever you want with both your BTC and BCC holdings, like re-purchase the alts you originally shifted.

Actually the best point to be made here is that Bitcoin is still too complex for non tech-savvy people to fully understand.  This is the type of scenario I expect the majority of my friends would find themselves in if they didn't do their research.
The thing is, people as a whole are generally lazy.  They will gravitate to quick and convenient, despite the fees or the power they willingly hand over to financial institutions.  Bitcoin needs to be quick, convenient, and secure. To acquire, to hold, and to use.  We just aren't there yet.

Agreed. I think it's the banks that are getting snippy when they're being used as an anonymous funnel to a currency outside of their control.
I signed up to CaVirTex recently and made a transaction using the Bill Payment option. Took a day and a half but worked flawlessly.  Note: I did have to upload pictures of my ID and utility bill to be verified on the site.
Just be sure that your bank will either allow you to add TAYPE INTERNATIONAL or ACITELECOM as a payee, and you're golden. Otherwise there is a direct withdrawal option as well.

To be honest I'm not all that convinced that mining (even in a pool with one lonely videocard) would be unprofitible.
I just mentioned this in another thread too.  What happened to me is that I set my PC to mine BTC 2 years ago.  I made 8 coins or so in a few weeks and then stopped thinking it would be unprofitible. BTC was worth less than $2 each at the time, I believe.
Had I kept my PC running, I would have made a healthy sum based on today's exchange rate.  So I always add the caveat when people ask the question about mining that they shouldn't refer to today's BTC value, but what they feel could be the value in a few years before dismissing the idea of mining even with lower-end hardware (in a pool of course, solo mining would be a waste).

It is a pain in the ass but bear in mind that Bitcoin is in its infancy. There are people working on solving the issue of convenience, but it won't happen overnight. Until it does we'll have to make do with current methods.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:05:52
I'll play Devil's advocate here.
I believe it woud be FinCEN's concern that Caldwell could be used as an unknowing middle-man to ship illicit funds.  Send him bitcoin, he provides new addresses containing portions of sent value split across multiple physical coins.  Sort of like a very inefficient and expensive tumbler. Then the receiver could be a different person from the buyer as a "gift".
Not saying they're in the right here, but I figure that's their mindset.
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:08:34
Just as an FYI: I wouldn't take a risk buying/selling Bitcoin or Bitcoin-related products on Ebay or through Paypal.
moral_Agent is correct in that mining is currently not profitible unless you have lots of money to purchase high-end ASIC miners (which may also never meet their Return On Investment depending on how much you pay for the ASIC). 
There *IS* a caveat to this, however... 2 years ago when I found out about bitcoin i set my PC to mine.  In a few weeks I had 8 coins, but they were only worth less than $2 each.  I stopped mining thinking I was too late for the true "gold rush" as well, but now looking at the current price of BTC, I know I was pretty wrong on that.
So if you do decide to mine coins, don't think about your profit based on today's worth, but on what you feel a Bitcoin could be worth years from now.  Who knows, maybe 1 coin will be worth thousands? This is a highly speculative time in Bitcoin's life-cycle.
As for online materials to teach you about the coin, this subreddit is actually a good start. Then there is the Khan Academy who have a series of Bitcoin-related lessons to help catch you up quickly enough.   
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:40:49
Yeah but Redditors have friends (mostly) so it's a good way to get the word out. It helps to get people who may have only heard about BTC in the news to now have some in their hands, so to speak.

There are only 2 rules to keep in mind.
1. Never invest more than you are willing to lose.  Only ever use disposible income, and don't use it all, either.  Be sure to allocate funds so you can also enjoy the life you're living today.
2. Never take anyone's advice on investments above your own instinct.  They may be right, but they may just as easily be wrong.  No one here is The Oracle.  Going back to my first point: If you only invest what you're willing to lose, any mistakes you make along the way won't be catastrophic to your finances.

In general I don't believe the gov't is too concerned at this point.  Bitcoin is proving itself slowly, but the adoption rate is tiny. Not enough at this point for the gov't to do anything with. They are likely keeping an eye on it, and are waiting to see what the climate will be in a couple of years before any action is taken. 
Right now however, I agree with the reasoning behind shutting down the MtGox account. Bitcoin can remain unregulated, but once your business deals in converting to a regulated currency, you need to follow the rules. Simple as that.
Bitcoin won't gain any serious traction if the message is all about taking down The Man. It needs to co-exist with traditional fiat during a transitionary period like this.  If you see a huge spike in merchant adoption, you'll see the big gov't bear wake up.

Yes, the coin lacks stability at the moment.  Why? Because it's still in its infancy.  The coin was only brought to light 4 years ago, and has only been discovered by a wide audience 3 months ago.  This includes those who view BTC as a currency and want to spend in a trendy hipster fashion, and those who get a thrill from speculation and buy in the hopes to make a quick buck.
The stability will come when the larger coin holders have re-distributed their wealth through sell-offs like today, provided that the price stays high enough to discourage people from buying BTC in large quantities and continue the trend.
We have to stop looking at this currency from the standpoint of days, weeks or even months.  This could take years to stabilize.  Each dip like today is re-distributing funds from one (or a few) large holder(s) of coin to many smaller holders.  The line will eventually level out and that's when you'll see merchants being a lot less hesitant to buy in and start accepting BTC.
Until then, companies like BitPay will help ease the pain of the fluxuations for those who require stability (selling product with a very small markup, for example).  Provided these services stay around duing the transitionary period, it'll all even out in the end.

This.  Something smells fishy. It's not like an agency committed to deterring money laundering would just come out and say "oh, you want to exchange BTC to CAD? Yeah, that's cool. We'll just look the other way."
CAD to BTC may skirt around certain laws, but I highly doubt any company converting BTC to CAD would be allowed to run legally without registering as an MSB and following regulations.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:13:18
Not necessarily. It all depends on the situation.
If someone has determined they wish to invest $100 per paycheck of disposible income, that can be viewed as a smart, risk-adverse way to invest.  I'd argue that would make them more prepared for any wild variance since they won't be as emotionally tied to the investment.

I mentioned this in another thread but just to re-state:
FinCEN are about aiding in the detection and deterrence of money laundering and terrorist financing.  I believe that their approach to this is that Caldwell ends up as an unsuspecting middle-man in an inefficient and rather expensive tumbler.  Person A sends him 50 BTC money from an address to be split up into 45 1BTC coins, each with their own address.  He asks that these coins be sent as "gifts" to Persons B C D E and F.  It's a possibility to launder, and that is really what their focus is.
The way that Caldwell should be able to continue running his business would be to sell his coins with empty wallets.  People only pay for the cost of the coin and shipping.  The private key is still hidden behind the tamper-proof holographic tab, and the public key is visible allowing the client to fund their own coin.  That should bring him from the "money transmitter" realm to the "goods and services" realm.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:14:18
Yes and no.  Exchanges fall under different legislation under Money Service Businesses.  They also have to follow AML/KYC laws, but they're not a straight transmitter. 
I believe that casinos also have AML regulations that they must adhere to. Not sure what they classify as, but it's there.

In a future where cartels stockpile and own vast amounts of mining equipment, they go to war against each other in order to shut down or steal the warring faction's mining farm.
Meanwhile at MIT is an engineering professor who becomes stricken with cancer, and succeeds in building a 98% energy efficient ASIC to help fund his medical bills and provide for his family. With the help of one of his drop-outs they employ many chip-dealers to sell the product on the streets.

To run you must first learn to walk.  As it stands today, any merchant who demands BTC as payment alone and doesn't also accept local currency will likely end up losing profits to those competitors who do.
On the other hand, merchants who accept BTC in addition to local currency will draw the attention of competitors, who will feel as if they need to do the same in order to maintain or increase their customer base.  
Only after the vast majority of merchants start accepting BTC will you see a rise in consumer adoption of the coin as well, likely brought about by banks and credit unions also competing with each other to provide services to gain customers in this new space, making it a lot easier to purchase and store your coin.
Like a complex rube-goldberg machine, it will be a series of transitions on all levels that will allow BTC to succeed globally, and not just the will of merchants to demand it in lieu of other currency alone.
@_date: 2013-08-02 23:07:10
As far as buying vs mining, I say why not both?  Mining does contribute to the decentralization of the network and in a pool you can make some small coin even with a mid-range video card. Yes that changes as more hash power comes online, but it's still something.
If we advise people not to mine because it's not worth it, you'll end up with a few big players handling the vast majority of the hash power, which goes against the principles of a true decentralized network.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:50:25
Here's a little story I've told before:
A couple of years ago I found out about BTC by accident. I started mining and in the 2 weeks or so that my PC was running, I mined around 8btc.  Back then the price of a coin was so low that people I knew we're telling me about what a waste of energy it was. So I stopped.
If I had known then what I know now I would've done the exact opposite and bought more hardware to support a little mining rig.
So you know what? Good on ya, man!  Sure the price may not be worth the electricity bill today, but in a couple of years you may find you have a decent amount of money there, and you'll be helping the network at the same time.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:19:21
Not really, no. Transferral of Bitcoin to/from Gox does not require verification. Only fiat.
Look, the government is saying this:  Bitcoin can remain as unregulated as it wants, but if you're trading in OUR currency you have to follow the rules.
Do you want wide-spread adoption? Then you'll have to cater to everyone. This includes Joe Q Public who pays his taxes and wants to play within the rules set by his/her government.  
Personally I think that this move will help legitimize the currency and anyone previously on the fence about it's legality will jump in.
Again, BTC is not being regulated. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:15:08
Oh I agree with you on the cost averaging. That's what I personally do. Thing is I know a few people who have invested more than they could afford on things (not Bitcoin) simply based on hype and have ended up in debt they could have avoided when the investment didn't meet their expectations.

I realize this, and my explanation probably came across as being narrow. The US has frozen an account for mtGox which exists in the US connected with Dwolla, a US-based company. Now Gox have stated that they require all accounts dealing in fiat to be verified.
Perhaps this was done because Gox bend over to the US, or perhaps they expect other countries to follow suit and are covering their bases. I'm just basing my opinion on what has already happened.
Full disclosure: I'm Canadian, and it's (currently) still legal to exchange fiat to BTC up here.  I don't expect that to last very long, however.
