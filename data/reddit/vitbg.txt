Ikinoki functionality has been affected on the website, not the domain itself.

 another version, or more of a plea to our estimated dear Senator...

the point is that the time it takes to drive it up is much longer than to push it down... we have witnessed a Chinese panic sell-off

There is a lot of hardware and difficulty is up, but it doesn't pay off to the purchasers of the hardware... This is what worries me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:45:21
so you don't consider Chinese authorities' backlash as a fundamental shift!?
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:55:09
yes, what i meant is that "this time its different" in relation to all other bubbles, tulips, nasdaq, housing - you name it
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:50:50
well that's what regulators usually do, but we can't be certain about it...

I agree, should we be able to stabilize at current levels it will be much better for the community. Just saw that South Korea has exempted Bitcoin from capital gains tax:

How can we evaluate where we are in the Bitcoin cycle. This parabolic curve can not go on forever, the point that mining hardware doesn't pay off is a curious one, don't you think?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:39:18
I totally agree with your point.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:15:13
the growth i inet users has been quite exponential. second of all, why the heck are you comparing the price of a supposedly financial asset to a physical service that has real value for its users. the only thing every chinese owner of bitcoins can do now is pretty much travel abroad and eat in one of those bitcoin restaurants

bubbles happen all the time, and every time people say "this time its different"
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:54:59
Actually Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseydonym 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:10:44
yeah, this time its different :) that's precisely the type of comments that i was expecting to hear
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:37:59
It was completely irrational to perceive that prices above $1000 were sustainable in the first place...
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:43:16
ok, you have a point here, but if Bitcoin is only used by Chinese people for this reason there will be even more authority backlash
