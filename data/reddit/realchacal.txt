It is possible that you make say 20x when the Bitcoin price goes up 2x. Of course this must have some disadvantage (otherwise everybody would do it), which is, that you will loose all your money if the Bitcoin price falls under a certain level. This is called being "liquidated" and it happens all the time. Same thing works the other way round: If you want you can make sick gains when the Bitcoin price goes down. In that case the disadvantage is that if the Bitcoin price goes up over a certain level you lose everything. This is what obviously happened here, since in the last hours the Bitcoin price jumped quite a bit.
**Conclusion:** Nothing to see here. OP must be some kind of total noob if he is excited that people get liquidated when the Bitcoin price jumps.

\&gt; "The inputs in a Bitcoin transaction are not linked to the outputs of the same transaction".
Right, but wrong conclusion.
I'm talking about sending money from Exchange A, to Wallet B, to Wallet C, to Exchange D. In this case, we can can link all inputs of a transaction to all outputs of a transaction - because it still belongs to the same person.

If you ever experienced how it feels to be censored on r/Bitcoin, especially by being shadow-banned (you just don't know that others can't see your post/comment) and then trying to ask the mods what's going on and get auto-replies like "this decision is permanent - don't try to contact us again, since this may lead to permanent ban" THEN you'll understand how angry this can make you. Especially when it's in a reddit about free and open money, and you know for sure that you are no paid shill or spammer and had no bad intentions. Worst thing is: 100% of new users are experiencing this: You sign up to reddit and r/Bitcoin because you are new and have a legit question/ thing to say: Guess what: After you took the time (say 1 hour) to write a post, they tell you "No, you can't post". Why? "Cause you're new." - which is a joke, because if they would have read the post, they would have easily found out that the post was legit. But they don't. They prefer to auto-deny.

There must be a misunderstanding. When I send 1 Bitcoin from Coinbase to my Trezor, then from my Trezor to my Ledger Nano, then from my Ledger Nano to Kraken - it MUST be possible for software to figure out that path when I specify start and end point. I guess my wording was just bad.

Your comment is just the same simple, old argument but wrong on so many levels.
* If every reddit denied new users to comment without comment karma, no user could ever comment anything.
* Being new on r/Bitcoin doesn't mean being new to Bitcoin or being dumb. You can't assume that posts from new users on r/Bitcoin are automatically low quality or could have been googled.
* I'm not denying that we have to prevent spam. But preventing spam by auto-denying new users to post is like auto-denying everybody to enter an aircraft to prevent terrorism.

From my understanding (which I have from [Andrew Poelstras presentation]( MimbleWimble **EITHER** can be made in such a way that if a quantum break occurs we loose privacy **OR** we loose fixed amount of coins (that means attackers could inflate the currency). Of course we would want to lose privacy in that case.

No new insights in the article, just the **opinion** of an "expert".


Now everybody ask themselves: "Am **I** using multiple addresses or only one address?" See? It's the **most normal** thing to use multiple addresses, therefore the 62%-quote doesn't tell us anything. My point isn't that Bitcoin wealth is centralized; my point is that we just can't tell - and the article certainly didn't change that.

Your wallet is not more or less a "third party" than the standard Bitcoin Core client!
You obviously will want to choose a wallet that does Schnorr aggregation as decentralized and private as possible (like Wasabi wallet does coinjoin today). Other wallets that do Schnorr aggregation centralized or keep records on their servers or charge a fee probably won't have a chance. However, MAYBE, just MAYBE, some wallet/ service will offer you Schnorr aggregated coinjoin transactions only between people who did some KYC before. That would have the advantage for you that your coins were less likely to be tainted with "criminal" coins after the transaction. While the obvious disadvantage would be that you (and maybe your transactions) are known by the wallet company, you'd still have more privacy in the network, so that random third parties you are sending coins to can't see anymore how rich you are. (Which is a joke in Bitcoin right now.)
Not that I want to discourage you from asking further questions, but it's totally open right now how all this will play out. Only fact is: Schnorr seems to be better in any way than what we have today. Because everything you can do with Schnorr is OPTIONAL.
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:35:31
:D glad to make your day
but is my point valid, though?
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:37:53


For this to happen we'd need Schnorr signature aggregation. Which would make coinjoin transaction more private **and cheaper** than regular transactions. Also, IMO we'd need higher fees (maybe like 5 USD?) so that &gt;90% of people really use coinjoin.
Edit: Oh wait I think I misunderstood you. You want to make coinjoin the default for 100% of transactions (in the base layer), right? Do you know if some high-profile core developer already researched/commented on that?
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:02:44
You are absolutely right!
My simplified example was just to show the transaction size advantage! Your example also shows the privacy advantage! Excellent job, sir!

You can still make normal single transactions. (Aggregating your transaction with others is optional.) You would broadcast your (single) transaction to the network as today. If you want to aggregate your transaction with others, you would have to do this before broadcasting the (aggregated) transaction to the network. That means the aggregation process would happen as defined by the wallet you're using. It could be centralized/ semi-decentralized/ decentralized.

The point of this is not the exact words. It's that a traditional bank talks about Bitcoin as a normal asset.
Even better: It's not a state-owned **private** bank; It's a "Anstalt des öffentlichen Rechtes" (literally: "Institution of public law"), which basically means their main priority is not getting rich but doing what they are required by a special law.
@_date: 2019-10-06 12:18:43
Yup. Possible solution: Use your ledger in combination with third-party desktop software instead of Ledger desktop software. In case Ledger pushes a malicious firmware update, they probably only can leak your private keys to your computer/ to the third-party software and not any farther (of course assuming that the third-party software isn't malicious, too). Can someone confirm my thinking?

For me "a promise is a promise" doesn't explain anything. Try this explanation instead:
* There's incredible value in a scarce resource that exists within the digital world
* In theory, many different cryptocurrencies could serve this purpose
* But: If the world always started to use the "better" cryptocurrency (as soon as one came around), then we wouldn't have digital scarcity (which was our original motivation for cryptocurrencies).
* So the dream of a digital, scarce resource only works for the **first digital resource ever - or for none**.

Almkaglor, thank you very much for your answer! May I ask you where you are from and what your background is? (Not trying to make you leak personal data, just wondering what way brought you to your knowledge and your ability to express it so clearly. Wondering if I should start diving in deeply, too.)
And just to make sure: The bottom line of your upshot is
* Pedersen commitments are better for MimbleWimble
* If a cryptographic break on ECDLP happened, MimbleWimble wouldn't be doomed **any more** than Bitcoin
* A quantum computer would probably break ECDLP
* If the quantum computer wasn't **secretly** researched/build/used (so that we could see it coming), we wouldn't have a catastrophic problem (other than that we'd have to hard-fork to something quantum-resistant, which may have many disadvantages, but wouldn't be catastrophic).

Normal transaction:
* "Send 10 coins from address 1 to address 2 and my signature to authorize this is dkljföljoöieaoföijaöejfakslöjdföweifasdhfklasdjfjasdlöflköasdjfweioaöfhdslöjasdklfjoawiöefhlasdfhajksldofi"
If we introduced Schnorr signatures (which Satoshi didn't because of patent issues) then this would allow us to "aggregate" signatures, that means that multiple people could combine their transactions to one big transaction with just **one** (aggregated) signature:
* "Send 10 coins from address 1 to address 2 **and** send 20 coins from address 3 to address 4 **and** send 30 coins from address 5 to address 6 **and** our aggregated signature to authorize this is asdklöfjjösadfljaslödkfjlöasjdflköjalsödfjlöasjdlöfjöaleioewiauröjajasdlkdkfjdjkföjdlkfdkfjdkfjdlfjöfjlöajslludf"
As you can see, the transaction size is significantly smaller than it would be for 3 separate transactions. This means a lower fee per person. So if you did a coinjoin transaction, it would not only be more private but also cheaper than a regular transaction.

A centralized server would be even quicker. Hence your argument is worthless.


A lot of money for the dev team is a valid argument, however, it doesn't say anything about if the basic idea is good or bad. But this is way more important.
Peter Thiel has faith in the project? Valid argument, if you have faith in Peter Thiel.


Well if it reminds YOU of something then this obviously convinces me! Thanks for convincing me. Who wouldn't just blindly go with some random guy on reddit who is "reminded of something"!?!?


They are not. They are worthless bullshit. But sure, go on and name a example which you consider "neat".


So your argument for "why EOS is promising" is "a lot of people own EOS because EOS is promising"? Is that your argument? (just want to make sure). And by the way: The main reason EOS had such a successful ICO was perfect timing during bull run. That's rather an indication that it's overvalued.

With every firmware update you are 100% trusting Ledger, the company. To be very clear: If Ledger deployed malicious firmware (for example because the Ledger CEO and his developers turn out to be criminals and they conspire) they could take all your funds. Note that Ledger Live would also have to be compromised, but that should be the smallest problem for the attackers in this case. Using your Ledger hardware wallet together with a desktop software from a third party (instead of using Ledger Live) could potentially protect you from such an attack. Also smart: Don't be the first one to do firmware updates.
Do I think that the Ledger CEO will turn out to be a criminal? Absolutely no. Do I think that his developers / key personal will turn out to be criminals? I have no clue, I don't know them. I'd love to understand how the Ledger CEO chooses and controls his developers / key personal / source code.
So, should you be afraid of this kind of attack? No, because they probably wouldn't attack 100% of Ledger users - instead they would attack the **richest** single one of them, then claim: "he must have done a mistake" (if that guy goes public at all).
