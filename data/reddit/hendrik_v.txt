Just because right now nobody can imagine it, [doesn't mean we can't](

VRT published an opinion piece urging people to sell their bitcoin around the same time. Coincidence?!?

OK, I enjoy a bit of hypothesizing, and I am still pretty new to the scene... So please anybody, correct me if I am wrong here. I really want to understand this!
Suppose that there is a complot of chinese miners that effectively want to put the bitcoin chain into a death spiral and they plan to do so right after the next difficulty adjustment (in ~1800 blocks according to OP). This will cause the blocks to become superslow, let's assume 1 block per hour (dno if this is realistic or if it could still be even worse). The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, so it would take 84 days before the difficulty is adjusted downwards.
Questions and observations that I have:
* Game theory says that even with extremely slow blocks, there will still be miners on the chain because they will have a higher chance of getting block rewards. That is assuming that the price stays high enough. According to [this link]( the cost for mining a bitcoin is between 500$ to 1500$ depending on cost of electricity. Are the people who care enough about decentralization to keep bitcoin above that price? Despite a superslow network? After all, if it fails, it means that it was not decentralized enough and an organized party was able to destroy it and then you are left with Paypal 2.0 (not my analogy, but I like it a lot).
* A lot of bitcoin has been traded since the bitcoin cash fork on the first of August. If the main bitcoin chain dies, it means that **a lot** of people will lose it all. All the fiat they have invested. That's a lot of money and I recon that the interests of this group are too great already to let the chain die (whatever it may take).
* After the difficulty adjustment (after 2800 blocks), the difficulty would be so low that 51% attack on any of the new blocks would become a possibility (afaik?).
* On the other hand, it leaves bitcoin community 84 days to react. I'm not _that_ technical, so I don't know what the possibilities would be. Implement a new hashing algorithm in those 84 days to make sure that the Antminers can no longer be used for bitcoin mining? Is this even feasible? It would make the miners that are still active on the bitcoin chain very very unhappy of course...
* One other measure that the bitcoin chain could take is to make segwit a hard fork rather than a soft fork, thus eliminating the asicboost. It wouldn't save anything on the short term, but longer term it would.
In the end, bitcoin is your/my/our coin. You decide how you want your coin to be. And if you want your coin to have 8MB blocks, that is fine too. I want my coin to be censorship resistent, and resistant to miner concentration though.
Anything I missed? I'm just tired of writing this :-)
EDIT couple of words and a point about segwit.

The currency it is in has nothing to do with it. In the fiat-world, if the government has any way to take down a reward for a hit contract, they will do so.
The Ethereum web 3.0 is just like the early internet days in that respect, completely unregulated. Governments will try to regulate smart contracts and they might even succeed. Who knows.
I'm not saying anything about whether this would be good or bad, just stating fact. In similar vein, I simply asked if the community would find such a smart contract immoral enough to do a fork. ETC certainly wouldn't.

Interesting. If an immoral smart contract like that were created on the ethereum chain, would the ethereum community hard fork to kill it?

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this writeup! I have been trying to find actual information for weeks now, and I've had to dig through dozens of pieces of the puzzle. This writeup + [Crypto Daily's video on Bitcoin cash and ASICBOOST]( actually made it all clear to me.
As a user, I'm on the side of core developers.
I had also already asked myself "if some rich dudes want to go in a certain direction so they could line their pockets even more, why don't they code it themselves?". You answered that one too! :-)
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:23:12
I agree. There are too many people invested in bitcoin just for the fiat-gains. They don't fully understand the tech and the paradigm shift it represents. First sign of a bear market, and they're gone.

Forgot to mention that is important to know which chain you are on when doing a transaction after a split! It may or may not be 100% clear.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:36:31
You are of course right, but the question was about "better at certain things". :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:40:27
This scenario is unlikely imo, but I'll lay it out anyway for people who might not know:
- In case a chainsplit happens in the near future and there is no replay protection, your coins will be 100% safe on both chains as long as you make no transactions.
- Before making any transaction, read forums/reddit/boards, do your own research, whether it is safe to make a transaction.
- It is to be expected that solutions to prevent replaying a transaction will be put in place ASAP. Just make sure to inform yourself first.

There are dozens of examples of coins that are better at many things than bitcoin:
* No-transactions-fees-IOTA
* General-purpose-usage-ETH
* Privacy-XMR
* dPoS-LSK (users vs. 2x-miners would not even be a discussion on the Lisk-chain, because users just stake and vote)
* ...

Thanks. So basically it is the current volume and bandwidth times two.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:24:23
Shooting at the person rather than the argument now, are we?
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:27:15
Emergency difficulty adjustment is one possible solution for loss of hash power.
No replay protection means very simply that it is possible to scan the mempool of one blockchain for transactions, and then copy the transaction to the other blockchain but change the receiving wallet address. It can only be done if you make a transaction. No transaction = no possibility to replay it on the other chain.
