When you say that the majority of miners must accept the changes, what does that look like? Installing a patch to the mining software?
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:14:51
Thank you for the insight.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:49:07
Good point; it would probably be cheaper to smash a CGI iPhone.
Perhaps you should look into this?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:36:55
I'm sorry but what is it you are claiming is a result of this attack? The only deeply troubling problem that could come of this attack is an internal double-spend on one of the exchanges that is using outdated technology, which has been mitigated by the exchanges shutting down temporarily.
As for the rest of the network that is running the right software, the worst that is happening is the potential for slower confirmation times.
Could bitcoin be more resilient to an attack of this nature? Yes. Is the network crippled or offline or compromised? No. It is certainly withstanding the attack, which is more than can be said of the targets of most of these attacks.

Increasing the supply has no effect on demand. It might have an effect on the price, though.
But I agree with your point. It is silly to destroy electronics in rage.

An appeal to nebulous credentials doesn't make your "I know better than you" argument sound any more convincing.

If the SR2 operators are not stupid, then there is virtually no way anybody is going to be able to verify who took the coins.
Why would they tell the truth when the truth is known only to the people that actually did the hack? If they did steal it, the worst case scenario of telling this lie is sending the internets on a wild goose chase while they disappear.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:43:42
Or, in economics terminology, creative destruction.

Being as flappy bird just disappeared, you might be able to fill the world's time-wasting void with Bitcoin... if you hurry.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:57:32
Exactly. Bitcoin is the internet soap opera.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:55:33
The network does track a unique address for each transaction, but the transaction id is only part of this address. And the transaction ID can be changed (though this malleability issue) before the transaction is verified. 
Thus, the 'good' wallet implementations track their balances based on the full transaction signature which is verified by the network, rather than just the transaction id, which cannot be trusted all the time.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:29:17
It's not really about using the network. The problem is that their wallet software pays attention to these Transaction IDs which should be ignored.
They have an implementation, it's just not a very good one.

Except good news. That's mundane news.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:45:43
Yes, lets just reference whatever the media tells us to.
It's still 'one of the largest markets' because everyone is selling their holdings as soon as they can before they completely implode.
In other news... the respectable exchanges have already rebounded to prices above where they were before the silk road 2 hack.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:21:38
It turns out that virtually every mainstream news headline about bitcoin is false and misleading.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:43:00
I will look into that more. 
I'm curious what happened to the transactions in those blocks?
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:21:54
Pretty outstanding, I'd say.
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:50:43
Good call
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:24:11
Yes, I am pretty experienced with C++, so I have been reading through the source since the git repo was linked. 
I am pretty satisfied with the information I have received from this community so far, and I will continue to poke around the source to see what more I can learn on my own.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:19:02
So you are saying that you think every miner is going to dig through the code and have the practical programming knowledge to understand the implications of a change?
EDIT: it even goes way beyond the code itself. Understanding the implications of a change to that algorithm would also require a pretty hefty economics expertise and some non-trivial abstract reasoning. I would wager very, very, very few people would be able to understand beyond the people involved in developing it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:44:12
I agree it is an attractive alternative, given the state of the world, but blindly putting faith into something because the alternative is bad is not particularly rational.
EDIT: Which isn't to say that believing in bitcoin is blind faith. It just would be for me without seeking answers to these questions.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:13:09
Yes he 100% nailed it. I'm surprised there's not an andreascoin altcoin yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:54:16
I get that. The thing I'm not on board with is why do you think the users would reject the change (if the implications or implementation were not obvious)? 
Let's assume that the person is both technically brilliant and nefarious. Assume he/she found a profoundly arcane and difficult to notice way of changing the protocol for his/her purposes. Assume it would take someone of similar technical brilliance to notice the change.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:09:34
How did I misinterpret you? Also, when did I talk about shutting down governments?
The title of your post does not imply the inherent political agenda. Change 'without' to 'despite' and it does. The title of your post is itself an attempt to minimize the political implications of decentralized currency.
I think you forgot a word in front of your parenthetical statement, but it seems like you are attempting to passive-aggressively paint my statements as a straw man. Perhaps try to address them instead of implying I am misinterpreting you.
Finally, I did not ask you a question (other than a rhetorical one), I was explaining that the intrinsic political implications of bitcoin do not align with what you have explained about your political stance, and that any attempt to fit bitcoin into that stance will render it next to useless. If you think I am wrong, talk about that, rather than appeal to my alleged misinterpretation. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:54:55
Seems like your argument is that as long as bitcoin is primarily converted to/from USD or other currencies, you are not participating in the libertarian dream, because the transactions on both ends of bitcoin are still a part of the old system.
The "libertarian wet dream" would be for bitcoin to be traded in its native state without the middle men. The middle men must exist to grow the system, but us libertarian wet dreamers would count it as a total loss if this system of immediate conversion to USD became permanent. 
You don't see the benefit because it hasn't developed yet. The only profound existing benefit of bitcoin is the ability to transfer value overseas without enormous fees. Yes, there is a conversion on both ends, but it is much cheaper than traditional means of transfering money between continents (or even borders in many cases).

Somebody wrote the algorithm and (presumably) can re-write it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:16:40
This is the answer I was looking for. Much Appreciated.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:20:25
That clears a lot of it up, thanks you. 
I guess another sub-question is, if there were some sort of controversial update and only a subset of the miners decided to consent to it, what would that do to the currency? Split it?
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:28:09
Correct. Thank you for clarifying my terminology.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:22:24
I appreciate the response.
I'm not attempting to project some belief upon the system, I am just trying to satisfy my concern about the worst case scenario I can imagine, because with a system containing $10+ billion, the worst case (in terms of the human element) is not only likely but nigh inevitable.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:50:44
There are so many. We could start a new subreddit to cover them.

My money is still on Gox being full of shit.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:35:38
Right, so everything except for the erroneous transaction was moved to the new block in the proper fork.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:38:46
Thanks for the link and the specific info. That makes sense. I didn't know there was a git repo.
Anyway, it sounds like a fairly decent system, but it still depends on the integrity of the small group that controls final commit power on the repo. I'm not saying that these people are corrupt. I am trying to push the worst case scenario as far as I can to answer my nagging concerns. 
So, IF somebody with commit power on the repo wanted to pull one over on everyone, they probably could, could they not?
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:15:14
The only scenario in which your particular ideology would be happy with bitcoin is the scenario in which bitcoin will have become useless. We will have traded the current middle men (who are forced to tell governments about our money for taxation purposes), for new middle men, who will be forced to do the same. And guess what? They will make transacting at least as expensive as it it is now, because that is what humans do if they can.
In this scenario, we will have a dubiously useful layer of abstraction applied to the current financial system that may or may not make it more secure.
What I am getting at is that anyone who subscribes to the economic teachings of Keynes to support their political ideology (and it sure sounds like that is you) should vehemently oppose bitcoin, or else attempt to subvert the trading of native bitcoins, and if you do not you are being intellectually disingenuous. Bitcoin is not a "neat and simple way of sending money through the internet", and if that is all you think it is, you are mistaken.
Weather you like it or not, bitcoin has political implications intrinsically.

Thanks for the discussion, btchombre. I appreciate your willingness to humor my questions.
I agree it is better and probably more perfect than the alternative, at least ideologically. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:31:13
That's probably a little extreme, but I think it is fair to say that this group of people that is charged with protecting the integrity of the currency is probably ill-equipped to fully understand the implications of the changes that we are asking them to be critical of on their own.
If the developers act in goodwill and fully document their objectives in changing various aspects of the API, of course this is not an issue. 
But I am asking the question assuming that this sort of power will necessarily corrupt the people wielding it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:00:33
Yeah, I can't see how this is related to the malleability issue.
Seems far more likely to be an internal scam to me.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:21:16
Interesting; thank you for the example. I did not know that.
