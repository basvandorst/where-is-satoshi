What about the fact that bitcoin is a currency pretending to be a stock, and will crash horribly when people cash out.

Bit coin cash, yes.
What is "a lot of money" anything under a couple hundred thousand I would put in. Over that is too risky to hold money into.
I mean essentially it is really stupid to invest a good portion of your money into any cryto. There is no price guidance besides " I remember back in 2013 it went down, and then back up, so this time it will too"

Did you really just explain to me that you buy higher every month because you know it will go up every month? 
Are you actually autistic or something? Or are you just poor putting a couple thousand into bitcoin and don't understand yet?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:48:11
So you essentially buy bitcoin at a higher price each month?
How do retards like you become legal adults?

Bitcoin behaves like a stock, because that's exactly what it is. No currency fluctuates 100 of dollars a day, and it will never be a currency if it does.
Keeping your money in a bank is 1 millions times safer than crypto. Money in banks is insured.
Besides "banks are scary and evil" you have no argument.
And let's be real, the only people that need to worry about getting there money stolen is the ultra wealthy, the banks don't give a shit about your 4 k
