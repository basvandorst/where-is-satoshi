Nearly 10 years of existence, having been through countless issues and surviving. Decentralized and trustworthy tech. Largest group of developers by far.  99% of all alts from 2 years ago do not exist today. Exchanges and laws existing to support best practices and integrity.  If "BigVarDaddyCoinCash" makes it to an exchange ran by "\u\BobTheBuilder', other exchanges in the world should be wary of this coin, and by no means consider it legitimate or trustworthy.

Good. Could you imagine if Roger Ver of BCH buys a million dollar ad campaign designed  to mislead facebook moms?

Just trying to prevent Bitcoin Cash from manipulating government text with false information.

Bitcoin has been around almost and survived all forms of issues. it has largest amount of 'credibilty' and trust (via blockchain). Exchanges arent going to willingly add new/unproven coins willingly "CocainCoin" without being able to fully trust their code or wallets.  The same way your grocery store isnt going to trust the gold in your hand without the proper tools/systems in place to do so. Trust is everything

With every Ver thread, BCH trolls now write “enough roger ver” then the bots upload. Very predictable!
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:12:34
Bch backers and bots posting “let’s stop talking about Ver” to legitimize Bitcoin Cash.
