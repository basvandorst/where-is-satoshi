What are the use cases for bitcoin at the moment in Greece? 
For everyday needs cash is better, no? Bitcoin could be useful if someone needs to send money to someone in geographically distant place in Greece or to someone outside of Greece. But those people are a minority. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:54:09
Very interesting.
send $0.25
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:13:04
Or you could say: so good that you accept fiat, this way I can keep my valuable bitcoin for myself :)

I installed it but when I tried to launch it, nothing happened. Windows 8.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:19:35
Thanks. But I am not computer scientist. I am looking for general explanation.

Russian Ruble has NOT lost 97% of its value as shown in the graph, maybe 50%.

What could be the actual intrinsic value (if any) of the stack of notes pictured here?

What do you mean by offline machine? Computer that is only powered up and connected to internet for synchronizing blockchain form time to time? Or even more offline than that?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:47:17
So I have Bitcoin Core with full blockchain downloaded and I got Bitcoin ABC client to get my Bitcoincash coins. I thought Bitcoin ABC will start to download its own copy of blockchain but it looks like it uses the blockchain that was downloaded by Core (in hidden folder .bitcoin). It seems to me that it is not good idea for both clients to use that same folder because starting from today blockchains are different. So what is the correct way to proceed? Did I mess up something already?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:19:17
Is this the correct way to claim BCC if I have BTC on Bitcoin Core?
Install Bitcoin ABC client on different computer.
Just copy-paste wallet.dat from Bitcoin Core to data directory of Bitcoin ABC.
Are there any possible security problems with this?
@_date: 2018-10-24 10:25:23
Thanks, but as I said I will use other blockchains as well, maybe I will claim forked coins or try to synchronize that other chain that people say is impossible to synchronize :)
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:27:42
Thanks for explanation. I don't have hardware RNG, the same as most of other bitcoin users I guess. So Linux and Windows OS would use some human input (mouse, keyboard) for generating randomness? That makes sense.
Lastly - "It photographs low-paid office workers in third-world countries tossing  coins. The device uses image recognition to detect heads or tails. It is  very slow" - is that for real? Can I learn more about this service somewhere? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:32:12
ok, thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:16:22
Thanks for the reply. But how to do that - "start it with its own datadir"?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:46:10
Thanks for explanation. 
Can I request new receiving address in Core and then send all coins to that, like sending coins myself within the same client? 
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:50:30
PANIC BUY!

Euro notes are generally ugly, except for 20 euro note which is looking ok. 500 euro note's size is too large, 5 euro note's size is too small etc.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:10:36
This must be reason for today's price crash, right?
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:30:21
Maybe hardware is too weak? But I had Bitcoin Core on approx. 3 years older laptop with weaker CPU and although it did synchronization slowly, it didn't just freeze.
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:56:51
ok, but how do you send bitcoins from that offline machine when you need to do it?
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:19:21
I have 64 bit Ubuntu.
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:31:49
Thanks. Now I think that it could really have been due to overheating.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:49:24
Is there any way to test it? Laptop itself is brand new.

What would be the next best bitcoin wallet? Is MultiBit HD ok?
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:38:42
Yeah, I meant verifying blocks, that happens concurrently with downloading, right?
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:26:18
Sorry, I don't understand what exactly do you mean?
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:44:22
Problem was (hopefully) solved by limiting number of cores/ threads working on bitcoin-qt to 1 in bitcoin.conf file. 
Looks like it wasn't overheating after all, just bitcoin using up all resources of CPU.
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:07:55
Will they use their mega-bunker to protect clients' bitcoins from confiscation by government if such situation arises?
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:24:31
Would it be good idea to "lock" bitcoin value with bitreserve.org?

It's not for me, it's for a friend of mine - she's a beautiful girl - trying to convert her to bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:48:53
She said: "Cool. Thanks." Thats all :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:38:21
Gotta help those ladies
send $0.50!
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:48:48
"They can then convert their bitcoin to real dollars in their bank account"
There will be objections to that "real dollars" part ... :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:34:55
You will have to buy btc @ Bitfinex price then
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:32:30
If you sold btc for fiat on Bitfinex how can you withdraw btc?

There is actually bitcoin exchange being developed in Latvia, currently in beta stage: globitex.com, they call themselves Institutional Grade Global Bitcoin Exchange. I don't know if they will have any advantage over bitstamp or gdax though.

ok, thanks!

I would invest $100 straight away to get exposure and then look for dips and buy $50 worth at a time
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:31:16
I guess that is because those are institutional investors and they need to buy everything on regulated market, not just some unregulated exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:39:35
Hardly anything happens, right? Not a single Bitcoin ATM, virtually no merchants accepting bitcoin etc. I believe onecoin is more popular in Latvia at the moment :D
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:06:26
If you posted your wallet address here once you have it, someone will definately send you some bits :)

Wouldn't the wisest thing for ordinary Greeks be just to withdraw money (euros) from banks and keep it in cash at home? Maybe bitcoins will be useful for sending money to someone abroad if government freezes/ limits banking in Greece.

There will remain some hardcore users; however, with ban in place mainstream adoption will be impossible.
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:00:39
Maybe because with bitcoin it is easy to fund opposition organizations/ events; ruling regime naturally does not want that. Bitcoin probably also can be used to transfer capital abroad.
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:38:01
I would be interested to hear from someone from Greece too. In my opinion it is likely that the Greek population in general is unaware of bitcoin though.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:32:39
Can I buy blockchain with credit card?
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:16:59
"Cap" stands for "capitalization", I am not sure that "Total Value Capitalization" makes sense. 
Maybe we should call it just "monetary base" (expressed in dollars)? :) "Monetary base of bitcoin" - that could drive central banks crazy :)
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:36:35
Best option probably depends on whether you plan to report sale of bitcoin for tax purposes.
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:39:24
Now bitcoins that I sent appear on blockchain.info. Case closed.

ok, now it is 0.34 BTC already. Maybe this thing will work.

War loan - opt out with bitcoin to-day
- that is brilliant
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:19:50
Great idea. I want to donate to Wikimedia.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:29:07
Maybe there is a way to do it right: we could say that bitcoin's monetary base is 16.35 million bitcoins, which by the way currently translates to ~39 billion dollars :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:53:44
Fiat is actually at least in part backed by violence/ threats of violence, right?
1.) Companies are obliged to take it as payment for goods/ services;
2.) People are forced to pay taxes with it.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:37:34
Thanks for the reply. I am kinda new to Linux too - I guess there is no point in "reinstalling" Bitcoin Core wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:15:21

Thanks for the answer. 
Maybe I wasn't clear in this question "What determines where one block ends and the next one begins?"
I actually wanted to ask about the block which is currently being solved - what determines that transaction x goes into the block but transaction y has to wait for the next block (in mempool?).

Those are SELL orders. Buy orders are green.

It was primarily meant as trolling, considering how negative central banks are towards bitcoin. It also could somewhat legitimize bitcoin but I know that lots of people here think that we don't need such a legitimization.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:48:10
The smallest order you can place for a buy or sell trade on GDAX is 0.01 BTC, ETH, or LTC.
According to: 
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:21:51
A person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence - by this definition (future contingent event not under his control or influence) all financial speculation is gambling, except for some big players which actually can move markets :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:16:58
I bought some.
@_date: 2016-07-13 15:58:25
I wonder if they plan to shut down their operation with the transition to the new blockhain which actually never happens because they experience some fatal technical problems while doing this. This scam has been going on for some time already, I don't think they can extend it for much longer. She actually said twice that onecoin website will be switched off on October 1 due to transition.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:17:04
OP suggests that those big orders are smart money leaving market, most likely because they think market has peaked (for now at least). It's all conjecture, though.
