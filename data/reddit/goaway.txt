Yes I have seen a viral video before, and I am aware that electricity travels at the speed of light. I know what social networks are and I've seen page statistics reporting at least that number of views before, on more than a few websites.
Either way, a &gt;200% increase in value over an 8 week period is going to raise eyebrows. (or at least discussion)

If I were you, I would strongly promote (with detail) the security features that are in place for Kronos, that were not present in Bitcoinica before their recent loss.

Thank you for responding.
Do you think the people buying bitcoin currently are aware of the bitcoin production rates? (more specifically, the December halving)
What do you think the bitcoins are mainly being used for?
Again, grateful for any input. 
@_date: 2012-08-17 15:01:20
That's actually quite a nice summation in a way.
@_date: 2012-08-17 12:16:22
Thanks for that response.
I looked up the announcement you mentioned, and found this post to be the closest to what it *could* be. [link](
For context, one of the cofounders for bitinstant responded to the speculative post: 


with the following:


I agree there are a lot more services compared to last year but, the acceptance by a government of bitcoin would contribute much more in fueling the current surge (if enough insiders knew about it)
@_date: 2012-08-25 19:00:45
Well, it's all relative I suppose but $50 million is a drop in the ocean for a government budget; pretty sure most governments spend 4 times that on toilet paper every year. 
On a more serious note though, I don't agree that a scared entity (be it a governmental organisation, or a financial service with a vested interest elsewhere) taking action against bitcoin would result in a positive outcome. At this stage of the game, it remains a clear risk to the current model.

Ah, terribly sorry old chap, I was actually talking about my electrical arc vacuum modem.  (ಠ_ృ)

Thank you for responding.
I am very interested in that you mentioned Iceland as being related to the announcement.
Are you referring to [this post]( on the bitcoin forums? (I just googled for it)
@_date: 2012-08-17 12:32:30
It's rates like that which got me wondering in the first place.
Looking at data from say, 2 years ago until today, I can see the value being around 6 or maybe 7 dollars a bitcoin [speculative chart]( which would roughly match up in line with the growth in services (ignoring the May bubble). 
So, to see it getting above $14 and rising more than 50c a day... 
Thanks for your input.

Are you concerned at all that he might actually default?
It would leave you with a rather large obligation if he did.
Or is this whole thing for the purpose of marketing?
@_date: 2012-11-06 01:24:12
Yeah in retrospect the pirate thing was off.
I think what I was trying to say was that it only takes the control of a relatively small percentage of the market to have a significant impact on it, and while bitcoin remains small it is always a risk.
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:58:24
Thank you for your response.
Under your (abrupt) guidance, I checked the current services page on the bitcoin wiki, and confirmed that the list has grown extensively since I checked 6 months ago [wiki link](
It still seems like an incredible increase for such a short period of time... or am I missing something?
@_date: 2012-11-05 14:16:15
Your concern is justified.
While the market for Bitcoin remains little-league, there is always the possibility that entities with appropriate funding could manipulate it.
(Pirate did it for example, and he only had an alleged 5% of the total market.)
A good mitigator would be if people start spending more of their bitcoins rather than speculate. (economic diversification helps stability)
@_date: 2012-08-25 17:35:50
There is no guarantee that this won't happen. If an entity such as NSA or similarly funded body wanted to gain control of the network - it is extremely likely that with their superior budget, they could. As the network grows over time however, it will become more difficult (expensive) to do so. 
As for ASICs taking over laptops though. Laptops (or rather, CPU mining) were superseded by GPU mining a long time ago, and ASICs will similarly replace GPU mining as it becomes more accessible to the general consumer market.
Provided 51% of the mining can stay out of reach of one organization, things will stay afloat. If you want to worry about something more realistic, I would probably focus on market manipulation. The last week has shown us what a 5% stake in the market allows one to do (a measly 5 million dollars worth). Were an entity to begin manipulating with 10 times that amount... it would truly mess with the market.
@_date: 2012-09-08 07:24:38
No offence, but there are some aspects of your analysis which I don't feel so confident about.
For one, the huge price drop happened **within literally thirty minutes** AFTER Pirate announced his intention to close. It might be worth considering: why cash out all at once, after telling everyone? If he wanted to maximize his profits, wouldn't it make more sense to hold onto the BTC until the price rebounded? 
That is, if cashing out was actually his intention at all.
He has already shown us before that [he enjoys experimenting with manipulating the market]( It could be sensibly argued that at this stage of his game, he can affect long-term movements in the price more effectively by holding the coin rather than transferring out to cash *at this moment in time*. 
(Have you ever heard of Mr. Copper? Did a surprisingly similar thing back in the 90s with the copper market - [read about it here](
Lastly, any truly big depositors with this scheme are not going to be voicing anything, because among other things they are most likely:
(1) working out how to realistically recover from the loss and 
(2) as gvsteve mentioned above: they are feeling ashamed. (I know I would be!)

Interesting content but, some quite peculiar mistakes.
I hope he gets his book proofread before publishing it.

Nice writeup.
The only thing which might be added is that the hashrates being shown appear to be based on overclocked values, which'll require additional cooling (affecting costs).
@_date: 2011-06-12 02:58:45
@_date: 2011-07-16 04:37:53
I think that list is going to be floating around for years.

These are called Yatsuhashi! Actually Nama (raw) -Yatsuhashi to be exact. Yatsuhashi 'dough' is composed of flour, cinnamon and sugar which has been literally pounded together. It typically has a white or red sweet bean filling but newer fillings are arising now such as chocolate, etc.
The reason they are difficult to locate locally is because they have a relatively limited shelf life of around 12 days, which discourages stores from importing them in any significant quantity. This is a shame because they are easily one of the best-tasting souvenir sweets in Japan!
We can certainly look into getting some for you, although it would require shipping via EMS courier in order to get them to you fresh enough to enjoy (2~7 days). We also recommend you eat them all in one go. (In front of other people is best.)
If you are interested, please drop us a message either here or on the site - thanks for your interest!
