@_date: 2015-12-22 17:26:39
That's not really true.  I've found it to be extremely rare to have different cash prices from running a card.  I like Bitcoin, but I don't like having to be the one to pay the fee when I send it.  If the fees rise, I'll simple stop using it.  Probably a lot of other people will do the same.  And Bitcoin doesn't do anyone any good when it isn't used.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:28:13
I imagine Bitcoin being used for peer-to-peer payments.  "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" is the title of the whole thing, it's not "Bitcoin: A Long Term Savings Account".
It's fine for you to have your own use of Bitcoin, but don't force that use on everyone else.  I agree that security and reliability is of the utmost importance, but we are a long ways from blocksize having a dire impact on either of those things.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:34:59
Ok, that's fair.  I kind of took your comment out of the context of responding to the title of the thread too.  My bad.

Probably because they comply with KYC/AML regs.  That's the typical reason anyway.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:50:52


Not necessarily.  Soft limits can easily be put in place if we ever get to the point that a certain size is proving to be bad for the network.


I just hope it isn't too late.  An unrestricted altcoin can take over Bitcoin just as quickly as Facebook overtook Myspace.  If you don't give users what they want, someone else will step in and do it instead.


Fair enough.  I suppose we disagree on how much pure water is actually left then.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:21:57


I am so sick of this argument.  It is not proven, and is probably not true.  People around the world will still be running nodes regardless of how large the blocks get, because they know how important it is to keep Bitcoin decentralized.  Any companies with a vested interest in Bitcoin will too.  There will always be plenty of decentralization as long as Bitcoin is used.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:43:15
I'm not saying hardcode in what we think technology will be able to handle in the future - I'm saying remove the hard limit altogether and let the community decide on a soft limit.
As far as deciding what current tech can handle?  Just look at the success of various metrics on the blockchain.  Look at things like the number of nodes running, the orphan rate, bandwidth and data limits around the globe, etc.  Put all that information in the open and let the users of Bitcoin decide what is best.  I think Bitcoin Unlimited has the right approach.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:24:38
Same for me.  I almost wrote it out that way too, but decided against it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:05:14
I completely agree that this is the  priority as well.  But I also feel that 1MB blocks are quite far below what current tech is capable of processing.  Why do we not allow blocks that are as large as our hardware and network infrastructure can handle?
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:43:36
Larger blocks means a higher orphan rate.  Most miners will begin to selectively include transactions (i.e., only include transactions that have a fee high enough to offset the increased risk of an orphan block).  The market will thus tend towards only having fee-based transactions, but those fees will still be quite low and we'll have many transactions still propagating through the network.
In my opinion, keeping transactions free/cheap is a big key to ensuring the eventual success of Bitcoin, at least at this stage in Bitcoin's growth.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:25:23
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:51:23
Right, but the average user won't be using the full blockchain.  And the average user dictates which currency is going to be used by the masses.  Unless some real problems crop up related to block size that affect the average user, they won't have any reason not to use the least restrictive currency.
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:00:20


Less than 1% of what?
As adoption/usage of Bitcoin increases, the total take in fees will increase as well.  That's why it is important that the block limit is increased in one way or another, because without significantly increased adoption, the security of the Bitcoin network will drop precipitously when the block rewards fall off.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:58:25


Yes, but you have to ask yourself why someone with that much hashpower would be interested in doing anything detrimental to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:33:39
I think a year-long timeline is too long.  We need to implement something sooner - we're running out of time to avoid disruption.
Block sizes grew from 350kb average to 600kb average in less than a year.  We really need the increase by May to be quite honest.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:01:33
It doesn't force anyone to do anything.  If such a malicious miner existed, other miners could simply softfork by refusing to mine on a chain with blocks larger than X.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:08:11
Yes, but how will users have the slightly clue as to how much fee to include?  When mining prioritization includes things like age of coins and transaction size, things that the user doesn't currently have control over (nor should we expect them to), it'll cause a lot of consternation over fee calculations unless it is done automatically.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:19:05
A coffee in the US might be a month's pay in another. If fees are high enough to keep those sizes of transactions off the blockchain, we may as well tell a large part of the world they'll never be able to use it anyway.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:31:53
Miners conglomerated to china because of electric, building, and factory costs - it's the cheapest place for electricity, one of the cheapest places to build a warehouse to hold miners because of the lack of regs, and probably still the cheapest place to have electronics built.
It has nothing to do with blocksize.  I would still be mining myself if it was profitable enough, but when my breakeven point on a brand new piece of mining technology is years down the road, it doesn't make sense at all.  Especially with how difficulty continues to climb.  That isn't a decision based on the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:32:58
It seems like this is very obviously the case, so... why can't we do something about that?  Why can't we, as the userbase, find some devs who actually do what we want them to do instead of go against what we want them to do?  Why are we listening to this Bitcoin core group of devs at all anymore?  Why haven't we already raised the block limit?
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:23:02
The blocks getting bigger has absolutely nothing to do with centralization of mining.  The only reason that mining has centralized is because there aren't crazy profits to be made by individuals anymore.  Back in 2011, I could buy a GPU and make its money back in 3 days.  And I'd still have a useful GPU to resell if I wanted!  Even in 2012-2013 with the rise of FPGAs and ASICs, if you were on the forefront of ordering, you could make a killing because of how vastly efficient they were compared to their predecessors.
Now I, as a person who doesn't own a data center in China, would be looking at a break-even time of at least a year if not much more for a new mining machine given my electric rates and the cost of modern miners.
Node counts have dropped, and I will agree that is probably largely due to how big and resource-intensive the blockchain has become.  But I would also argue that there are many, many companies and people interested in seeing Bitcoin succeed, and if the number of Bitcoin nodes was to ever drop dangerously low, they would be the first to jump in and donate some resources towards the continued decentralization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:29:32


Why?  The average user has no reason to really care about that.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:14:55
Really the mistake was having a hard limit in the first place.  A soft limit could have dealt with spam concerns just fine.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:55:44


No they couldn't.  A block increase with a soft fork only happens if people agree to it.  If other miners don't agree to it, they'll simply orphan the block.  If bitcoin users don't agree to it, they'll simply devalue the chain with the big block and continue using the small block chain.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:54:38


Then let's remove the block limit and let miners decide how much they need to charge to make a transaction worthwhile.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:32:12


Yes they do.  Anything that damages the usability or reputation of Bitcoin will damage the value of Bitcoin, which will directly eat into their profits.  Miners want to do everything possible to see Bitcoin succeed, because the more Bitcoin succeeds, the more money they make.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:22:38
How is that different from your own node connecting to other nodes to find out what the latest data is?  Either way, you're relying on other people to give you the correct information.

@_date: 2015-06-22 20:05:33
I'm not the person you're responding to, but the growth we've seen in the past has been sudden and explosive.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to see a 10x increase in the number of users in a single month given the right circumstances, nor infeasible to see a 100x increase over a few months.  We won't have time to hard-fork it in such a case.  If transactions start taking hours or days to confirm, it could leave a very bitter taste in the mouths of all those new users who are trying it out for the first time.
I just hope stuff like the lightning network gets worked on and pans out - otherwise, Bitcoin could find itself suddenly in a lot of trouble.

If Bitcoin is successful, there will be PLENTY of people so invested in its success that they will be willing to bear that small cost.  And they'll find ways to monetize it too.  But Bitcoin only becomes successful if it can be used by many people, and 2 TP/s isn't gonna get us there.

That argument is completely destroyed if you force a connection to at least one known trustworthy node.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:59:01


Not if I connect to specific nodes I trust along with other random nodes on the network.


Well now you know one.  But either way, I don't expect to be able to personally know the people behind the nodes I connect to.  I wouldn't trust any single one of them by themselves, but I would trust a small collaboration of them (perhaps a minimum of 5) if they were published IPs for specific companies.  The likelihood of several companies being compromised for the sole purpose of a double-spend on me is incredibly low.  It'll never happen.
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:37:32
Efficiency means nothing long-term as far as total electrical usage by the Bitcoin mining network.  Mining hashes/sec will always trend toward the point of electricity = return.  Devices that use less electricity just means that eventually there will be more of them.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:34:16
It'll happen.  People will move to BU or XT as transactions start taking days or weeks to process.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:07:10
Why are you using anecdotal information for talking about future usage?  Bitcoin in the future is going to look vastly different than Bitcoin today because it will be more useful as more people use it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:25:24
The counterargument to this I hear is because spammers could continually spam the blockchain and just bloat it to be larger and larger, BUT, I really do think a flexible limit is the best option.  Otherwise we'll find ourselves in hot water when a sudden huge growth spurt vastly exceeds the block size limit and there's nothing we can do about it.  It'll be horrible for Bitcoin's reputation right at the wrong time - when people are trying it out for the first time.
My argument against the above counter is... why?  Who would continually spam the blockchain for months at a time simply to make it larger?  What purpose would it serve for them?  Couldn't miners simply temporarily require a higher fee to make such a spam-fest prohibitively expensive?
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:04:23
Isn't it better to have the option to transact both off chain and on chain though?  If we relegate the blockchain to only high-value transactions by artificially limiting the block size, it'll literally put it out of reach for much of the world.  We'll be using services not much different from the ones we already hate (i.e. VISA, Paypal).
Changetip is great, I agree.  But we have a choice to use it, or use the blockchain itself.  I don't want to be forced to use Changetip or Coinbase - that doesn't feel like Bitcoin to me, that feels like just another financial service.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:30:06
Really, if China wants only 8MB, then they can mine only 8MB blocks and refuse to propagate anything larger.  They'd likely quickly convince other pools to do the same, and we'd end up with a soft-limit, which is probably the best solution anyway.  That soft limit could be easily increased later on, as pressure from miners or users for larger blocks mounts.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:26:08


That's exactly my point.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:01:02

Increasing the block size doesn't automatically kill censorship resistance or decentralization.  I don't know why this assumption is always made - we could probably fill 100MB today and still the network would be as decentralized as it needs to be.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:29:50
What kind of a comment is that?
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:13:40


We've given control to a single group of individuals.  We've centralized the decision-making.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:38:17
I don't think 8GB blocks is a good idea today, just wanted to point out that it is possible to run them even with today's tech.  Even if we raised the limit to 8GB today, it'll be a long time before blocks ever get that large anyway.  Technology will continue to progress, and it is probable that by the time we actually need to fill a block with 8GB of transactions, modern computers would do it with ease.  And if not, we can always soft-limit it to whatever is reasonable at the time.
I don't understand what you're getting at with the water analogy.  My point is, there are people artificially limiting the supply of the water when we have plenty more to go around.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:32:33
Block size is not at all part of the problem.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:11:05




Are you confusing nodes with miners?  Having control of half of all nodes isn't some sort of magical number that'll allow you to do whatever you like.  All it takes is one node to distribute a longer chain and it'll be accepted by all other legitimate nodes.






Good point about anonymity and censorship.  I'm not sure I really buy the double-spend attack though.  If I'm connected to several nodes that I trust, the likelihood that someone is going to compromise all of those nodes simply to double-spend against me seems lower than my chance at winning the lottery having never bought a ticket.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:14:21
Interesting... I wonder if there is an easy solution to that particular issue, that all Bitcoin forks potentially look the same to SPV clients.  Otherwise, it would relegate all SPV clients to the trash heap for anyone who didn't agree with the popular chain.  If XT ends up popular enough, maybe QT would be forked again just to have a different header.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:49:37
You're completely naive to think that a successful big-block Bitcoin would be hosted on a single server rack anywhere.  When the very success of Bitcoin hinges on its decentralized nature, companies and individuals everywhere will continue to contribute to this quality.  Whether it's a Bitcoin-based company or a Bitcoin millionaire or even simple a company that makes use of Bitcoin, people WILL step up to the plate when the decentralization of the ledger looks like it is in danger.
I completely agree that Bitcoin needs to stay decentralized to succeed, but that's exactly why it WILL stay decentralized regardless of how big the blocks are.
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:59:48
8GB limit in 2036.  That's 21 years from now.
For some perspective, 21 years ago, most businesses and home computers were of the 5-10mhz variety (50 MIPS), had 4MB of ram, and a 200MB HDD, and cost about $7,500 (inflation adjusted).
A decently high-end machine today might cost $1,100. At a minimum it'd probably have an i5 that can do 83,000 MIPS, 1660 times the 1991 computer.  For that price you'd also expect 16GB of ram, 4000 times that of the 1991 computer.  And probably a 2TB HDD, 10,000 times larger than the 1991 computer's drive.  And to button it all up, it's only 1/7th the cost.
If we extrapolate these numbers to 2036 (which I know isn't a fair assumption to make for a variety of reasons, but let's go with it anyway), we'd have 137,780,000 MIPS, 64TB of ram, and 20,000 PB HDDs.
An 8GB block in 2036 then would be about the same as a 0.8MB block today with regards to HDD space, a 2MB block with regards to RAM, and a 4.8MB block with regards to processor speed.
I, for one, am not concerned about Gavin's plan, nor do I think it will lead to unreasonable decentralization in the future.  Technology is bound to keep up, and if it doesn't?  We can always scale it back some and work on developing other ways to cope with extra transactions in the meantime.  It would not mean the end of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:22:40
I'm with you on this.  Bitcoin isn't going to grow in a nice curve like that.  We've already seen how it happens - HUGE growth spurts, then decline, then another huge growth spurt, so on and so forth.  There's no way to predict when that growth is going to happen or how large it'll be, so we could end up in some serious trouble if it grows too fast and we still have a low limit on the block sizes.  It would be a disaster for the reputation of Bitcoin, especially since it wouldn't be a quick fix to fix - a new hardfork would require at least months of planning and coding for Bitcoin-based businesses to adapt without trouble.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:27:16
I can agree to that.
My main point is, we need to work to have as little restriction as possible in Bitcoin, because the more restrictive it is, the more likely users are to leave it for something less restrictive.
We should be pushing current technology to its max, else an altcoin will do the same and then be "better" than Bitcoin (from an average user's point of view).
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:10:38
I agree with that, definitely.  But it is clear to me that the blocksize does need to grow as it stands, and needs either a lot of overhead or the ability to quickly grow in the event of mass user adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:36:55


If you have 1 million transactions a day trying to make it through the same network that can only process 600,000 transactions a day, then a good lot of them will never get through.


Not indefinitely today, no, but eventually, yes.  Eventually, storing the blockchain will be just as negligible as storing a word doc on a 1TB hard drive is today.  The number of transactions needed has an upper bound - digital storage does not.
Now whether growth on the bitcoin network could outpace technology prior to reaching such a point is a better debate.  For that reason, I like the proposals that limit block size growth to technological benchmarks, such as internet speed or storage space.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:07:32
At the same time, if the "average Joe" cannot transact on the Bitcoin blockchain because it is too expensive, then you can hardly call that decentralized either.
Has anyone done any research as to how many nodes we actually need?
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:14:09
I've used instant settlement a lot with Bitcoin.  It comes with risk, sure, but that's why users can choose when to accept 0-conf transactions and when to wait for at least one confirmation.  You wouldn't sell a car with a 0-conf transaction.
For example, I've bought gift cards with Bitcoin through e-gifter.  They give me instant access to those cards even though my transaction is still at 0-conf.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe they do that for all transactions.  Maybe they only do it for transactions under $200.  Maybe they do it for trusted customers.  Whatever the case, they actively accept 0-conf transactions and apparently are successful doing so.
Stating instant settlement is not really possible with bitcoin is simply a lie.  It is ALREADY happening across MANY vendors and users of Bitcoin.
We don't need to protect against threats that haven't proven to be a problem.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:27:21
The potential for a flood comes with the potential for massive amounts of adoption.  Bitcoin will fall on its face in short order if the number of people using it doubles in a month again (which happened in 2011 and again in 2012).  And if it does, we're essentially ensuring that all of those people new to Bitcoin will never touch it again.
8GB blocks could process 26,000 transactions per second.  That's not enough to process all the financial transactions in the world, but it'd make Bitcoin a very competitive payments processor to the likes of visa (averages 2000 tps), etc.
Now obviously the network isn't ready for 8GB blocks yet - the hardware to run it would have to be hosted in datacenters across multiple servers - but I think in the future it is a definite possibility.  But the bottom line is, we should increase the block limit to whatever current tech hardware can handle and keep increasing it as technology gets better.  Otherwise we are simply artificially limiting Bitcoin's full potential.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:03:10
It's kind of funny how open-source advocates claim to love this sort of distributed setup for working on a project, but when push comes to shove and no one can agree, they start clamoring for a hierarchy of some sort.
This isn't directed towards you, just an observation made that was related to your comment.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:49:25


I really hope this doesn't happen.  The amount of confusion that would result from people actively using two forks of Bitcoin would be horrible.
Anyway, I'd rather err on the side of being too unrestrictive than being too restrictive - we can always fork a limit back in if needed without doing much irreparable damage, but Bitcoin's reputation will be ruined in the eyes of the public if it cannot be used for its intended purpose when we get a sudden 10x increase in the number of users.
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:52:37
Damn... then I'm still completely lost.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:01:49


And that'll end up being just as successful as squashing piracy.  People will just move to datacenters that aren't controlled by governments if something like that happens.


No, I said bigger, not 8GB.  And it would absolutely not be more centralized than Paypal!  Paypal is a single entity making decisions as a single entity.  It can decide to reverse payments or make money disappear or do whatever else it wants.  No one can do that on Bitcoin unless all the nodes are colluding in some fashion.  And the more nodes there are with varying interests, the lower the chance of collusion.
Maybe you're thinking about it from the perspective of number of servers, in that if a government wanted to shut down Bitcoin they would only have to go after a handful of nodes.  Certainly I'd not consider only a handful of nodes to be enough in such a situation, but as long as there are a healthy number of nodes sprinkled throughout a number of different countries, I don't see any governments being able to shut Bitcoin down.  Again, people and companies heavily invested in Bitcoin will ensure its success in this area - if only a handful of nodes remain, people will be racing to start up more to ensure Bitcoin's resiliency.
Even if a government did manage to succeed in killing every last Bitcoin node because the blocks were too large, it could be easily restarted to just use smaller blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:57:29
Yeah, ok.  Dumb idea.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:39:58


Lack of block size increases also comes with more centralization, as more people transact outside of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The only reason this would put people off using Bitcoin is if they were trying to run a full node.  Which, new users to Bitcoin shouldn't be trying to do anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:11:34
Wow, that really is a huge limitation.  I assumed that SPVs could differentiate between forks because that's a pretty important aspect of a client.
How does an SPV node know it is connected to a Bitcoin client, and not a client for some other coin?  Could the same method of determining this also be used to differentiate between forks of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:31:21
How do nodes matter at all when it comes to changing the rules of the network?  If I'm running a node and an ideological change comes across that I don't agree with, then I would have my node reject that change.  But that doesn't stop anyone else from accepting that change.  Likewise, if I am not running a node and such a change happens, I'd be free with an SPV client to only connect to nodes running a particular version that agrees with me.  Either way, I am choosing which change to accept, I'm not SOL as you say.
I imagine that if we ever reach a point where there's only dozens of nodes around the world, the IPs of many of them will be published by the companies who run them.  Connecting to a variety of those, as well as random public nodes, would help ensure safety against a sybil attack.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:28:23
Yes, namely because it is enormously less painful to pull back the limit than it is to increase it.  Increasing it will always require a hard-fork, unless we build-in some way to vote-increase it.  Decreasing it could be done simply by 51% consensus of miners deciding to reject any blocks larger than X.

I don't think even that's a decent guess.  If we truly reach a place where there's only a dozen nodes left in the world, they would undoubtedly allow more than 120 connections.  How many?  Hard to say.  But I imagine each of them would have major-website-sized resources dedicated.

Right, and then the altcoin without any silly block size limits will simply take over where Bitcoin failed.  Given the choice between a limited usage option with high fees and an unlimited usage option with lower fees, only the truly principled will continue using the former.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:30:53


That's simply not true.  As we reach the point that the block reward is negligible, miners will simply require a fee with each transaction (with a lower bound set according to each of their own profitability analyses).  And if we reach that point, larger blocks would actually help miners, not hinder them, as it would equate to more transaction fees per block.  2,000 people aren't going to pay $1 to make a Bitcoin transaction, but 20,000 might pay $0.10.


Fair enough.  But that's why I think proposals tying the automatic block size increases to something like internet speed make a lot of sense - the size will increase as the hardware becomes capable of handling it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:04:32
Yeah.... I don't think many people lend much respect to that particular core dev.  He's shortsighted as hell.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:00:22
It's REALLY not a big deal if it ends up being too much for the network to handle.  Bitcoin miners are as interested in Bitcoin's success as anyone else, so if people start dropping out because the blocks are getting too big, then miners will start making smaller blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:01:28


Well, yeah, that's kind of the whole idea of Bitcoin - a distributed ledger. If we're unwilling to allow transactions on the Bitcoin network because it costs the network storage costs forever in the future, then what's the point of even having Bitcoin in the first place?

@_date: 2015-06-01 22:19:30


I consider it quite urgent.  Every surge in Bitcoin userbase thus far has been largely unexpected, and we cannot hope to predict when the next one will come.  Transactions would virtually come to a halt under another surge of similar scale if we still only have 1MB blocks at that point.




@_date: 2015-06-01 17:43:30


I'm not either, which is why bigger blocks make sense.  Maintaining 1MB blocks will just ensure that most transactions have to happen off-chain, AKA just another paypal.
Also, if those devs are willing to quit over this, they aren't the devs the community wants anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:16:28


Which is why having the blocksize automatically increase is important.
You used to be able to fill up a hard drive with text documents for your homework, too.  Now you can write for the rest of your life and never fill one up.
Point is, technology is still growing, getting faster, better, etc.  I doubt we'll see Bitcoin grow fast enough that we can't keep up with it on common hardware.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:01:23
You're missing the point.  All it takes is a connection to ONE good node to negate EVERY bad node.  I'm not distrusting the public nodes, I'm confirming their blockchains with blockchains from other nodes.  Same as everyone does today.  Only along with those random public nodes, I'd be sure to connect to some certain-to-be-trustworthy nodes to be sure to negate the sort of attack vector you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:33:19
Why do we, as the Bitcoin community, need some stubborn devs to sign off on anything?
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:02:18

@_date: 2015-12-29 23:04:00
I'm all for LN if it proves to actually provide the efficiencies that it claims.  But we shouldn't be forcing people to not use Bitcoin.  They should be able to choose between Bitcoin and LN, and choose whichever one fits their needs better.  Keeping the block size limit artificially low (lower than what current tech can process) will only serve to prevent users from having a choice.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:04:21
That's way too slow when considering the historical growth of Bitcoin adoption.
It needs to be a flexible limit IMO, else we run the risk of hitting the limit in the event of a large uptick in adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:26:25
Let's leave the free market to determine the proper fee, not artificially increase it by having a low block size limit.  If a transaction has a low enough fee to not be worth it to mine, then it won't be mined.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:11:18
That's exactly how I picture it working.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:50:33
We already saw this happen with the last blockreward decrease.  Lots of equipment went up for sale, lots of miners with cheap electricity bought them.  The same thing will happen each time the blockreward decreases, except it will matter less and less as the transaction fees begin to make up more and more of the miners' revenue.  There will always be at least some miners on the blockchain.  Whether it is enough to keep it secure is another question altogether.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:17:33
To me, it is less important the new size and more important that it will scale up as the number of transactions grows.  It needs to automatically increase so that we can avoid another hard fork in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:53:56
The whole idea being you wouldn't need an account to withdraw money.

How, exactly, would someone do this?  Don't mining pools generally publish their node addresses so that people can connect directly to them?  And if the network was reduced to only a handful of nodes, I imagine all of them would have public addresses.  If you can connect to each of them, query for the same information, and get the same answer, is there any reason not to trust that answer?


Is this the only danger to worry about?  That you might not have the longest chain?  What issues could result of this?
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:04:46
Interesting, thanks.  It seems even you weren't able to nail down a hard number as to how many nodes are truly needed though?  I do love the torrenting analogy.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:55:40
I assume all the major mining pools are connected up with each other - they'd be stupid not to.  So they don't need to rely on nodes to prevent stales.  Certainly if users don't actually use the blockchain with the larger blocks, then it's kind of useless for miners to be mining on it though - their mined coins would be worthless.  But since we've seen that around 80% of the community supports larger blocks, I don't see any reason that the small block chain would continue to be viable once the change is made.
In reality, it's going to be a complete cluster and seriously diminish any future hopes of Bitcoin growth if there isn't a large majority one way or the other.  It looks like that majority is headed the way of larger blocks right now, but looks can be deceiving.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:25:11


Who says?  What is that limit?
Ultimately, I agree with you that off-chain services are important to keep in play in the case that we need them, but I don't see any reason not to ramp up the block size as needed until we hit a wall.  Artificially restricting the size just seems insane to me.
@_date: 2015-06-22 07:08:04
It would cost a lot more than a few million at this point, but certainly they have whatever amount of money it would require.

What does a "soft fork limit of 2MB" mean, exactly?
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:06:21
I just want the block limit to be increased to what current tech can handle.  Eliminating the hard limit and letting it roll simply on a community-decided soft limit would be even better, but I don't think enough people believe in that idea to make it happen.  Either way though, 1MB blocks are far below what we could safely (from a censorship perspective) be processing today.  That's the part that is frustrating to me.  It's like using a friend's gaming computer but he's only allowing you to play games from the 90's because anything more recent might stress it too much (stupid example but it's all I can think of at the moment).
Beyond that, I'm with you - we shouldn't remove Bitcoin's censorship-resistant quality in the name of more transactions.  I just don't think we're at that limit yet.

1)  Most miners mine on pools, which means they don't need to run a full node.  If blocks became larger, some of those pools might drop out or increase their fees.  But miners would always be free to mine with a different pool if it looked like one pool was getting too much of the hashpower.  With any reasonable blocksize (certainly much higher than 1MB blocks), I can't imagine a world where only one or two mining pools could afford to run a full node.
Even if that did start to happen, a solution would be found.  Miners don't want that situation because that much centralization would kill the value of Bitcoin, thus destroying their source of revenue - they would naturally tend toward decentralization for this reason.  We already saw this happen with deepbit in 2011 - they started charging greater fees until their share of the hashpool dropped to a more reasonable level.
2)  Miners creating huge blocks run two risks - a risk of block orphaning due to long propagation times, and a risk of block orphaning due to other miners simply rejecting their too-large block.  Is it really worth losing 25 BTC multiple times over just to TRY to curb the competition?  Not to mention, a solo-miner isn't going to be large enough to try this technique against the mining pool monsters, and a mining pool isn't going to try this technique because they wouldn't want to alienate their miners.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:35:40
And here I thought I was talking to a sane person.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:34:55


Most people, sure.  But we don't need most people to run a node to keep Bitcoin decentralized.  We only need a few.  And hosting in a datacenter doesn't defeat the purpose as long as the datacenter doesn't control your Bitcoin implementation.  Some Bitcoiners might be concerned about hosting in a datacenter, and they still could run it at home if they wanted to.  It's not out of reach to host a node at home even with bigger blocks.


Yes, but start talking about their millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins becoming worthless and I'm sure they'll reconsider.
It would cost what, $100/mo to colocate a machine into a datacenter capable of processing 100MB blocks today?  And that's just today!  That's a pittance for someone who is a Bitcoin millionaire.  I get that some people can't be bothered to go even that far, but I'm very confident that we would have enough individuals and companies interested in seeing Bitcoin succeed that we'll have multiple nodes running regardless of how large the blocks get.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:56:43
Bitcoin COULD process 8GB blocks today.  Granted there would be a lot of orphans and you might need to employ a supercomputer to do it, but it would still work.  And technology and infrastructure is only going to continue to get better.
Keeping the block limit artificially low is insane.  We're restricting the number of people who can transact directly on the blockchain for what reason?  The block limit should be equivalent to what current tech is capable of processing well.  And we are way below that limit.
You use the example of a limited water supply.  I'll continue this example.  It's as though the poor country has a constant supply of 10,000 gallons of water per minute, but has a faucet on the end that can only supply 1 gallon per minute and the country's officials refuse to put on a larger tap.

@_date: 2015-06-11 02:41:31
No, you don't need a majority to be fine.  You just need one honest node.  The longest blockchain supercedes any other blockchain, and if the bad actor who controls many nodes has the longest chain anyway, then we've got bigger problems anyway.  But if the bad actor is trying to feed you a false blockchain that's shorter than the real thing, he'd have to have control of every one of your node connections.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:52:02
Well not really though.  A consensus would quickly form one way or the other based on hashpower.
If the 20MB blockers had less than 50% of the hashpower, then their blocks would keep getting orphaned and they would very quickly change to a lower limit (no one likes to lose 25BTC).
If the less-that-20MB blockers had less than 50% of the hashpower, they would soon find their own chain much smaller than the 20MB chain and would be forced to switch or be left behind.  Some small-time miners and purists might continue to use this small chain but it would quickly become completely worthless.
Ultimately though, if such a change was made, I'm sure all the major mining pools would be in communication with each other as far as what block limits to set.  None of them will want orphaned blocks so discussing what limits to set beforehand is probably exactly what would happen.

Bitcoin will NOT be dependent on the good will of corporations and datacenters.  Bitcoin corps will be incentivized to keep Bitcoin healthy.  They aren't going to do anything malicious to the network because it would instantly devalue themselves.  And datacenters aren't (generally) going to mess with hosted machines unless they have malicious intent of some sort.  Regardless, there are so many datacenters worldwide that if one ends up being a bad apple, people will simply move to others.
If LN can achieve the peer-to-peer payments, then that's great!  But let's not limit Bitcoin from those who want to use it instead.


You know, I honestly hadn't thought about datacaps.  It's not something I have to deal with myself (yet).  It certainly is a valid concern.  But I still remain convinced that there is plenty unlimited data worldwide to keep Bitcoin completely decentralized with bigger blocks.

Right.  But in my opinion, it should be up to the miners as to how large they wish to make blocks.  Theoretically, transaction fees will offset the slower propagation speeds.

Well eventually the difficulty would diverge, but it could take a while.  If it was at the start of a two-week period and they only had 10% of the hashpower of the rest of the network, it could take 20 weeks for a retarget.

As others have already said, you need to cut this WAY down.  A CEO is busy and doesn't have time or want to spend the time reading all of the intricate details of Bitcoin.
My reply would be:
"Hi CEO,
I envision us using it to accept payment for our goods/services.  A third party service such as BitPay can be used without exposing us to volatility of the value of Bitcoin.  The customer pays us with Bitcoin, and we receive equivalent USD in our bank account a few days later.  There are no fees - it would be free for us to accept, so we would save on credit card and banking fees associated with our other remittance methods.
Please let me know if you have any other questions about this.

The math problems exist only to make it hard to create a block.  If creating a block was easy, then everyone could do it and all Bitcoins would be mined by now.  This math problem is difficult, but that's why it was chosen.  The difficulty of the problem is automatically adjusted every 2 weeks to ensure that blocks are still being found every 10 minutes or so and ensure that Bitcoins are slowly distributed for a good 100 years or so.
A Bitcoin block contains transactions.  This is the only way transactions are permanently recorded - through blocks.  Each block is tied to the last block with math, so a new block cannot be inserted between two of them without the math being off (think 2+2 = 4, but 2+1+2 = 5).
The math problem specifically is hashing.  It combines the previous block's hash, the hash of each transaction in the new block, an incrementing number (called a nonce), and a timestamp.  With all of those combined, it runs a hash on it.  A hash is a seemingly random result from a calculation performed on a number, but it is reproduceable.  
Here's a simplified (and made up) version:
(&lt;previous block hash&gt; + &lt;transaction hashes&gt; + &lt;increment&gt; + &lt;time&gt;) / 27 = ?
Now, as a miner, I would perform the above calculation over and over again, incrementing the increment each time.  This is what is "mining" Bitcoins.  Let's say the goal might be to have a remainder less than 0.02.
(&lt;1&gt; + &lt;5+3+8&gt; + &lt;1&gt; + &lt;141.405&gt;) / 27 = 5.904, remainder = 0.904
That's above the goal, so I must continue calculating by increasing the increment.
(&lt;1&gt; + &lt;5+3+8&gt; + &lt;2&gt; + &lt;141.405&gt;) / 27 = 5.941, remainder = 0.941
(&lt;1&gt; + &lt;5+3+8&gt; + &lt;3&gt; + &lt;141.405&gt;) / 27 = 5.978, remainder = 0.978
(&lt;1&gt; + &lt;5+3+8&gt; + &lt;4&gt; + &lt;141.405&gt;) / 27 = 6.015, remainder = 0.015
Bingo!  The remainder is less that 0.015, which meets the goal.  So, I have found a new block, which has a hash of 0.015 (this will be used in the calculation for the next block to create the block "chain").  One of the transactions I included in the block was a payment of 25 Bitcoins to myself, which is allowed since I created the block.  If the difficulty doubled, then the new goal would be to have a remainder less that 0.01.
If someone tries to claim that transaction with hash "3" didn't happen, then my block would no longer be valid.  Since the network agrees that my block is valid (it is distributed worldwide in a fraction of a second), then no transactions can be removed from my block, because it would change the calculation and my block hash would no longer be 0.015.  Likewise, if someone tries to claim that my block didn't happen at time "141.405", the hash would no longer be 0.015.  Basically, it is because of this hashing technique that no one can change the permanent record of Bitcoin transactions.  This is why we say that Bitcoin miners "secure" the network, because they ensure that no one can change the record of transactions once they have been made.

They say Satoshi's timestamps do not reflect a particular timezone.  That is FALSE.  The bitcointalk.org timestamps clearly reflect an EST timezone, given a person who gets busy at 7-8 AM and gets sleeping at 10-11 PM.

Really, they can buy up as many bitcoins as they want as long as someone is willing to sell them at some price.  It just depends what prices people want to buy and sell at.  I doubt they expect to control 4 million BTC right from the start, but as time goes on and demand increases for their ETF, maybe then they will.

We are not close to the limit.  We're averaging around 1 tps, and 1MB blocks provide for 7 tps.  Not only that, but the 1MB block limit can be changed, so if we start to approach that 7 tps limit, we'll likely just increase block sizes.

@_date: 2014-11-03 17:15:40
Because we don't need it yet, and because the best way to do this is still under debate/discussion.
Some people say increasing the block size to 10MB, or 100MB would be best.  Others say we should just remove the limit entirely right now.  And the last argument (which I believe Gavin supports) says that we should implement code that will increase the limit over time.  
It'll be a hard fork to the protocol, so implementation needs to be slowly and carefully planned.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:54:32
People don't want to spend Bitcoins when the price is down is what it all comes down to.  They feel stretched, spread thin, etc.  They don't feel rich like they want to spend willy-nilly, they feel poor and they hold on to every penny they've got, in the hopes that one day they will feel rich again and then be able to freely spend.

This is only true if the 49% network can differentiate blocks coming from the 51% network.  If the blocks from the 51% appear valid, and they form a longer chain than the 49%, then the 51% blockchain would be accepted into everyone's client.
The only way I know of to mitigate this would be to hardcode in the correct blockchain every X amount of time, but that would be a nightmare and obviously not a long-term solution.

The hash rate also "decreased" just as rapidly on the 18th, 17th, 16th, 15th, and 14th.  In reality, it could be just simple variance.  Without seeing a drop on at least a 7-day average, there's no way to know with any certainty.

Because it takes a long time to get everyone onboard with such a huge change (Gavin's timeline gives almost a year out before the change is made), because there's no inherent disadvantage in going with 20MB blocks instead of 5MB, or whatever other arbitrary size is chosen, and because the network could end up growing much more quickly than we anticipate.

You're effectively limiting the number of people who can use bitcoin though, if you limit the number of transactions that can take place.  So I guess if you want Bitcoin to stay a niche product forever, then sure, keep the block sizes at 1MB.

They do though, don't they?  Otherwise, every time a block is introduced that exceeds a size that some miners/nodes disagree with (and thus they reject the block), it would cause a fork.
@_date: 2017-02-01 07:02:33
That's very interesting, thanks for the explanation.
I suppose I would say that there is no need to worry about a node creating an invalid block because the economic incentive is to create blocks that would be accepted by all other nodes. Same with the 64 bit vs 32 bit implementations - the 64 bit guys wouldn't want to create a 2gb + 1 block because they risk everyone else ignoring it. Implied consensus?
Anyway, I understand that people don't want to risk a network split -and obviously ETH proves that networks CAN split and remain that way between groups that think differently and refuse to compromise. The same thing could definitely happen with Bitcoin, it all depends on how the community values different versions of bitcoin that arise.

Right.  Again I ask, what level of bandwidth and processing would make running a node prohibitive except for a small number of elite economic actors?

Three questions:
1)  Are there ways to abuse this system?  Once they have the gift card number, even if they don't spend the whole balance of the gift card and get a refund in BTC, they could turn around and spend the remaining balance right then and there... correct?
2)  One other service that did this "use unwanted gift cards" service never really had cards in stock.  What will Fold do to ensure they always have cards in stock that can offer the same discount?
3)  Why couldn't a company use USD for the same thing?
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:55:22
At the same time though, miners must have access to the full (pruned) blockchain in order to mine.  For some miners, it will be worth it to spend money on holding the blockchain so they can mine.  For others, it will not.
It would greatly surprise me to find that the entire blockchain would not be able to fit on a consumer storage drive at any point in the future.  I think storage drives will continue to outpace the blockchain forever.  And if a large solo miner or mining pool cannot afford a couple hundred for a spare drive, well, they probably couldn't afford the other equipment necessary for solo mining or running a mining pool anyway.

"The world" = "shareholders".  Overstock is a public company, is it not?  So I am certain he is using the two terms interchangeably.


Probably because the quarter isn't even over yet.


Let's break down the numbers.  According to Overstock's most recent 10-Q, they made a net income before taxes of 0.7%.  Assume credit card processing fees are around 2.5% of total revenue, which would be typical for a large business.  Now assume that fee is eliminated for 0.25% of all revenue.  That'd be a direct increase of 0.00625% to net income, bringing it up to 0.70625%.  Which is almost 1%.  Doesn't match up well with his 5% estimate, I must agree.
We must go deeper.
There's 24M shares outstanding, so $0.75/share would be net income of $18M.  Total revenue for Q2 2014 was $332M, so keeping with that theme we have a net income percentage of 5%.  Which means the change due to saving on Bitcoin processing fees would have a much smaller effect than even 0.00625%.
One final calculation to put this to bed:
$300,000 x 3 x 0.025 = $22,500.  This should be the total saved over the quarter on processing fees.  $22,500 / $18M = 0.125%.  0.05125 / 0.05 = 1.025%.  Again, back to the 1% number we originally calculated.
I must agree his 5% EPS attribution to Bitcoin seems to be total bunk, unless we're missing something obvious.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:50:59

And really, unless the vast majority of them are against it (tip: they won't be), it wouldn't matter.  The one or two who might be against it will just have to follow along, because attempting a fork would just be a failure.

So what level of bandwidth and processing would make running a node prohibitive except for a small number of elite economic actors?  How many transactions is that equivalent to?  I assume that you've already crunched the numbers on this...?
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:11:02
I don't think you understand.  A mining chip is not equivalent to a Bitcoin client.  Your router won't be "on the blockchain", it won't be able to authenticate and transact.  Miners are very simple machines - they connect to a server, ask the server for maths, compute the maths, look for a specific result, and return the result if it is found.

A Texas man was arrested Thursday and charged with running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme that in its height accounted for about 7% of the virtual currency in public circulation, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney said.
Trendon Shavers, under the alias pirateat40, raised more than 760,000 bitcoins in investments through his firm, Bitcoin Savings and Trust, from at least Sept. 2011 to Sept. 2012, according to court documents.
The investments were valued at more than $4.5 million based on the price of a bitcoin during the scheme.
Mr. Shavers, 32, has been charged with one count of securities fraud, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million, and wire fraud, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
In September, Mr. Shavers was fined more than $40 million and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 in relation to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil suit.
Mr. Shavers sold bitcoin-related securities from his home in McKinney, Tex., promising investors up to 7% in weekly interest. In the end, at least 48 of about 100 investors lost all or part of their investment, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.
Structured as a classic Ponzi scheme, Shavers took bitcoin from new investors to give to investors who had bought in earlier on, court documents state. Mr. Shavers shut down Bitcoin Savings and Trust in August 2012, according to court documents.

You know, I'd be pretty nervous about having so many passwords.  If one is forgotten or goes missing (if you've written them down), then suddenly all your bitcoins are gone.  When looking at extreme measures to protect bitcoins, I've heard far more stories of people losing them because they forgot a password or their hard drive crashed than anything else.
I'd do a BIOS-level encryption of the whole drive and leave it at that.  Definitely make a backup of the key data onto a USB drive and a CD though, also encrypting both.  And make sure the password is copied/written down in many many places.
Other than that, it would be perfectly safe to use.

But they wouldn't be able to fill up blocks, and people would still be able to make transactions that confirm.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:09:46
Not back to square one at all.  Removing the block size limit does not mean miners have to mine every transaction.  Fees will most certainly still exist, and each miner will have their own threshold for fees based on what they calculate to be their marginal cost per byte of transactions.  The big difference is that no one could spam the network with higher-fee spam to push out legitimate transactions.  Blocks would simply get bigger until the spammer stopped, so that they could include those high-fee spam transactions AND the legitimate transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:08:44


No, people will simply begin migrating to alt-coins or stop using Bitcoin altogether.  No one can force users to pay more than they want to for transactions, and arbitrarily limiting the number of transactions in the hope that this will happen is insane.

I had to explain to him that blocks are now full, and that his transaction may never clear, and that there's no easy way for his client to deal with it.  Basically, he may be out the money until something changes.
It is utter BS the situation that Bitcoin is in, and utter BS that people like you keep saying that it is "working great".  I wouldn't recommend Bitcoin to anyone right now - it is far too complicated to use with full blocks and transactions not confirming and having to choose what fee you need to use to actually get a confirmation.

@_date: 2015-01-21 20:54:33
Right, I'm talking more about future bitcoin users when bitcoin is more ubiquitous.  If lots of people are using it, but it suddenly costs them $0.25/transaction to use it, then they're going to find other payment methods that don't cost them anything to use.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:57:06
Sure, I understand.  More likely, people will simply move back to fiat for most of their transactions, and will only use something like Bitcoin when necessary.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:17:14
No it does not.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:22:27
No, but I would argue that high fees would drive them away.  Customers don't normally have to pay for financial transactions, merchants do.  If transactions were restricted to the point of users having to spend a non-negligible amount of money to perform one, it would severely hinder adoption.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:52:05
Not true.  My entire house is electric resistance heat.  So I keep my miners around because hey, free money when I was gonna heat anyway.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:56:17


So your entire argument of not using 0-conf transactions rests on... nothing?


This is bad advice.  Good advice looks at what happens in the real world, not what could happen in theory.  If you look at the thousands of transactions where merchants are actively accepting 0-conf transactions, there is very little fraud.  If there was more, then places like e-gifter wouldn't be giving instant $100 gift cards in exchange for 0-conf transactions.
0-conf transactions are useful in some cases and should not be demonized.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:12:24

What is a DNM?
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:24:27
Ok, what about it? Organic growth in Bitcoin transactions would cause the same thing to happen. We're above block capacity now, so the men pool is of course going to keep growing as more and more transactions are left out of blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:16:26


Definitely.  But because there's only so much room in the blocks, only so many people can use Bitcoins.  For me, it is not worth $5, but it is worth $0.05.  People WILL be pushed away from using Bitcoins if the fees rise too high, and that price point is different for each person.  Just as raising the block size will push bitcoin toward centralization, tx fees increasing will push people away from bitcoin.


I can only hope people are more reasonable about the blocksize by then.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:10:58
Well put.  It'll be interesting to see if there is actually a holdout of "old bitcoin" users who refuse "new bitcoins" once this fork happens.

@_date: 2017-02-04 18:13:43
Why do you think it is so important to have segwit first? It seems like an "upgrade" forced on us by a corporation who is solely interested in making a profit by keeping blocks small. Why doesn't that concern you?
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:41:02
I realize that, but we are far from the point that increasing the block size would be detrimental to the number of miners, if only for the simple fact that more Bitcoin users = higher price = more miners. And the more users we have, the more people we have incentivized to keep Bitcoin going. If a miner starts getting a significantly large amount of hashpower, the users can decide to change the mining algo or mine at a different pool (if it is a pool) or put price pressure on the miner. A miner isn't (generally) going to sabotage his income by going against what the community wants and causing a price crash.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:34:18

It's a fair point.  There can always be outliers.  I would be extremely surprised if there were any cases of people getting burned though, and even more surprised if it ended up being a greater amount of value than past Bitcoin scams.  It is not a good reason to disclude 99% of the world from making transactions on the blockchain though.


That's because there was little incentive to upgrade.  If you put it to people "upgrade or you won't have access to your money", then they're gonna upgrade.

I wouldn't, not at my current salary.  If I had extra money after paying the bills each month, then I'd take at least that much in Bitcoin.  But when I have to pay my bills in USD, no point in turning my paycheck into BTC first, only to have to convert it later.

All three actually.  CPU whenever it is verifying blocks (or if I've had a power outage, reindexing blocks for 3 days).  RAM is something around 2GB usage.  Hard disk is noticeably slower access for other things while it is running.

Ok, I'll agree with you it remains to be seen if the network as a whole can handle it.  I believe it can, and have no doubts, but I understand why you have yours.
And if you don't want spam filling up your disk space, then don't run a full node.  Plenty of people are willing to run nodes who don't care.

But it makes it much, much easier to perform a double spend.  Right now, a double spend requires special software or coding your own transactions.  The average person isn't going to spend the time to do it.  But RBF would make it cake.  It's like saying your wallet is just as secure on the curb in front of your house as it is on your nightstand.  A dedicated person could steal it from either place, but it is presented as much more of a crime of opportunity if it is just left out in the open.

I completely agree.  But so much of the discussion is pie-in-the-sky promises or I am questioning the motives of the people behind it (blockstream).  None of these capacity improvements exist yet.  Until they do, we should be increasing the blocksize WELL ahead of what we are actually using to have some headroom.  Otherwise when 1.5MB of transactions are trying to get through the system and transactions are taking days or weeks to be confirmed, the whole thing is going to fail.  At least in the eyes of the people trying to use it, which is what's important.
Bitcoin has a reputation to uphold.  We can't just let things slide because we aren't ready yet.  We have to be prepared as we can be, and 1MB blocks mean we are completely unprepared to deal with a wave of adoption.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:35:14
Ok, that's fair.  But if you go by that definition, EVERY transaction in Bitcoin would be spam.

Nice namecalling, I'm just trying to have a civil conversation.
I also do not believe the network is too centralized right now.  If you do, then I'm afraid we'll never agree.  Too centralized to me is if a single miner or pool has 50% of the hashpower.  I do not believe this will happen, because the miners have great incentive to ensure it does not happen.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:14:37


This is my whole frustration.  2MB isn't going to break anything or cause centralization, so why can't everyone get onboard with it?  I understand not moving to 20MB or 200MB, but 2MB?  What's the big deal?  Do people think it'll be a slippery slope or something?
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:53:38
That's a better point.  Small blocks are going to kill 0-conf.

@_date: 2016-03-14 08:31:49
Problem is you only need space heaters half the year.  So in the summer, hashrate is going to take a significant dive (since most miners are in the northern hemisphere).
On top of that, most houses have much cheaper heat sources than electric resistance.  Electric furnaces (heat pumps), natural gas, oil burners, wood stoves.  All of those are cheaper than straight up electric resistance heating, which is what mining is.
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:51:31
You're right, it might be unpredictable and have unintended consequences.  I'm game to try it though - anything is better than 1MB.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:27:49
I'm not disagreeing with you.  Fees are present in blocks with no size limit just as they are in blocks with a size limit.

@_date: 2015-05-05 22:14:09
Problem is, we really don't know what the future of Bitcoin holds.  It could have a sudden and massive increase in adoption that wasn't anticipated, as has happened in the past.  If we only increase to 2MB now, we could easily ram right into that limit with a big onset of adoption, and with a timeline of 10 months to make a new change, it could prove to be disastrous.  "Yeah, I tried Bitcoin a while back, none of my transactions went through, it's a pretty worthless system."
20MB gives us plenty of breathing room.  What are you so afraid is going to happen with a 20MB limit?  Is it going to kill Bitcoin?  Because a limit that is too low certainly could.
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:20:12
Ok, it's all fine and dandy right now, but what about when Bitcoin usage grows by 100%?  We're all expected to make half as many transactions then?
Also, response to  - what if those "withdrawals" were actually payments to a company for a good?  I wouldn't want Coinbase to hold my transaction so they could group it with others while I have the 15 minute timeout ticking down on my invoice.

As long as the ledger is public, and there are multiple public copies of it, what's the problem?  What's the huge concern you see?  Yes, mining and blockchain storage is becoming more centralized.  That's inherent in the nature of having a public ledger in the first place.  The larger it gets, the fewer people have the resources to store it.
You either artificially limit the usage of Bitcoin by only allowing so many transactions, or you allow it to grow and have fewer entities storing the entire blockchain.  I don't see a problem with the trend toward the latter.

I'm just saying this is the definition of spam, not that we should attempt to build a filter to keep spam out.  No matter what rules are created, some spam will make it into the blockchain.  My qualm is that we're preventing some legitimate transactions from making it into the blockchain by trying to filter out spam.
EDIT:  Price-discovery can also happen with unlimited block sizes, btw.  There IS a marginal cost associated with including transactions in a new block due to orphan blocks.

@_date: 2016-03-01 00:13:50
Fees could be much lower with more users though.  If 200,000 transactions are sent and each pays $0.05, that matches today's block reward.  And that's a much better scenario than 2,000 transactions each paying $5.00.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:28:11

What about my definition doesn't work?
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:54:28
Are you sure about that? Because initially, that's exactly how it worked. Miners would soft-limit block sizes to whatever they were comfortable with and it worked just fine that way.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:41:28
1)  Large reorgs with blocksize increase won't happen.  A miner wouldn't be stupid enough to mine a block larger than less than 50% of the mining community would support.
2) So what if someone can create a block that takes 15 minutes to validate?  It doesn't matter, no one will accept it, it'll simply be orphaned away.  If someone actually tries that "attack", they'll simply be wasting a block reward.
3)  Again, no miners are going to create attack blocks that would take hours to validate because no other miners would accept such a block.  You couldn't stall the entire chain this way.
I welcome you to detail any other issues you have with eliminating the blocksize.  All of them I've been presented with so far are eliminated with simple economic theory.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:33:02

@_date: 2016-03-01 19:12:37


Exactly this.  Each miner will have different thresholds.  Certainly free transactions are a thing of the past (for the most part), but transaction fees would be reduced to near the marginal cost of adding transactions to blocks.  If you add a fee to a transaction that is greater than the marginal cost of including that transaction in a block, then it'll be confirmed.  Higher fees could still be paid for quicker processing, since again each miner's threshold for fees required would be different.
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:40:10

If the bitcoin price goes up, more investment into bitcoin infrastructure and development will happen.  More people will be interested in and potentially use bitcoin.  SEC approval would most assuredly lend credence to the validity of bitcoin as well, so more people will see it as a proper currency and store of value vs just being a joke or trend.  It'll also give more room for large financial transactions to take place.  Also if pro-bitcoin people have more wealth, they can better influence other people to make pro-bitcoin decisions.  That's just a few reasons I can think of.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:01:39
You do realize that the entire bitcoin system works because miners act in their own best interest?  And that's exactly what we would need them to do if they were setting the block size limits.  They aren't stupid.

Or maybe early adopters actually believed in Satoshi's vision of bitcoin, not blockstream's forced vision of it?
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:10:37


You are very much contradicting yourself.  You say that 1MB is a sweet spot, but then say further block size increases would be useless.  Thing is, they would be FAR from useless.  They would make bitcoin usable for the average person again.  They would make people like me not afraid to invite people to use it again.  We could grow the bitcoin userbase, the value of bitcoin, and consequentially the development dollars thrown at bitcoin.
You're thinking visa levels of transactions, but I'm not.  I'm thinking how can we make bitcoin work TODAY?  With the people we have now?  And have room for at least some growth today?
It is very technologically feasible.  A hard fork honestly isn't a big deal - the scare-mongering around it has poisoned the minds of many.  And there would be many immediate benefits to doing so.
I agree that unless we wait another 20-30 years for technology to catch up, we won't be reaching visa levels of transactions on-chain.  But we can have at least SOME increase in transactions, and right now, that's really all we need.  BU would allow that increase, along with ensuring we don't have to hard fork again in the future to allow more space as technology gets better.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:53:08

@_date: 2016-01-07 21:14:04
I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.  A consumer or merchant should never have to deal with problems arising from a hard fork, because they're not the ones using the backend software.  That's the payment processor's responsibility.  The merchant or consumer will only see the front-end of it.  Software devs will know well in advance if a hard fork is to proceed (at least this is true of every hard fork proposal I've seen so far), and at least for block size changes, it would likely require no changes on their own end anyway, they'd just need to update their bitcoind software.  If they have their own compiled bitcoin daemon, then it's not more than a few lines of code to change it.
Basically, I don't think anyone (or very few people) are going to have the question of "I have a technology problem I don't know how to solve or who to contact".  All it is is a software update for everyone but tech companies, and tech companies have techs.
@_date: 2016-03-16 15:11:57

@_date: 2017-03-07 05:06:19
Please describe this gaming.  Because every example I've ever been given doesn't make sense - no miner would be incentivized to perform such an attack, and other miners would simply fork them off the network if they tried.

@_date: 2015-05-05 18:33:27
You'd need consensus among miners and full nodes for that to work though.  Or is that what you're suggesting - that it shouldn't be up to the community as a whole?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:48:07
It doesn't.  Miners won't let the network become too centralized - look at what happened with deepbit, for example.

I'd be fine with both being hardforked together TBH.  I even think the LN is an exciting development, I just can't stand how it is being forced upon us as the only option.  Let the free market decide which is better - to have transactions on the blockchain or via LN.  There is no reason to artificially restrict the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:09:30
Perhaps they plan to change to BU once a fork happens, but are just on core for now?  They would like to see BU happen, but agree the software still needs some work?  They support BU, but their programmers haven't yet had a chance to make the actual switch?  There's a multitude of potential reasons besides a "sybil attack".
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:16:19
I think that the market would value the chain it can actually make transactions on, not the one that costs $1+ to use and MAYBE your tx will make it into a block in the next day.
But maybe that's just me...
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:52:42
I don't want war, I want to see bitcoin grow and flourish, and I don't see that happening with $1+ transaction fees.  We need larger blocks and we need them NOW.  Every day we wait is hurting bitcoin's future potential that much more.  I don't want to see an altcoin win this race, but if bitcoin remains limited for too long, one of them undoubtedly will.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:05:49
Not really.  Miners can still choose what transactions to include in their blocks.  If the network is getting hit with spammy-looking transactions, they can choose to disclude them.  They could (and likely would) disclude transactions that don't meet their own standards for fees, which would be a much better method of price discovery than an artificial block limit.  So blocks aren't going to necessarily grow that much without a limit.
Aside from that, there are a lot of people who have incentive to run a node:
- Businesses dealing in Bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Bitpay, BTCEE, etc.  Without Bitcoin, their business does not survive.
- Large holders of Bitcoin.  They have millions of dollars of BTC and want to protect that investment - they'll invest in nodes to ensure BTC stays decentralized.
- Miners.  Obviously, every solo miner or mining pool has to have a node running too.
- Researchers.  Anyone who wants to do analysis of any of the blockchain data has to have a copy of the blockchain.  May as well run a node if you want to keep that data up to date.
- Web services that show blockchain data, such as blockr.io, will have to have a node running as well.
It's pretty easy to see that we'll never have a lack of nodes running because there are so many parties dependent on it.
On top of this, we really only NEED 2 non-colluding nodes to keep Bitcoin honest.  We'll obviously have many many more than that regardless of block size.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:26:36
I'm not really a coder or I would help solve things.  Amateur at best.
Anyway, as far as arbitrary limits, what's wrong with that?  Better than hardcoded limits at least.  Besides, flexible transactions makes this whole discussion a moot point anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:02:32
I really do think all the core supporters have their head in the sand with regards to which chain will be valued.  Transaction fees are only becoming more and more of a problem, people see that, and they will value the chain with greater hashrate that fixes the transaction fee problem.
It is certainly clear we will have two different bitcoins in the event of a hard fork though.  At least for a while.  There's no denying that there are hardcore core supporters and BU supporters that won't ever budge.
Time will tell though, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Miners can already soft-limit block size if they like.  They don't have to mine 1MB blocks - they could mine 500kb blocks if they wanted to, and no one could stop them.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:38:48
No, that's hashpower.

I'm questioning bitcoin's future BECAUSE we're stuck at 1MB blocks.  And I know I'm not the only one.
Price dropped because of China PBOC news, not because of antpool news.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:04:06
I think that's a fair metric to start with.  And really that boils down to replacing the current block reward entirely with fees.
25 x $440 = $11,000.  If we wanted to keep fees down to $0.05/transaction, and assumed that 1/10 of all transactions were "high priority" and paid an average of $0.15 each, then we'd need 176,000 transactions in each block.
That equates to a blocksize of around 100MB, by the way.
EDIT:  To carry this further, with keeping the blocks at 1MB, we'd need each transaction to pay up an average fee of $5.50.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:58:52
You *should* want bitcoin to grow in value and userbase, because that makes it more useful to you.  So that means you *should* care about how other people are affected.

Why do you think that all of the core developers would simply stop working if BU was implemented?  Surely many of them would continue working on the bitcoin project and not just stop all together.

I've seen the market bump up on pro-big-block news before, seems the market wants bigger blocks too!
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:27:42


A day has 144 blocks.  So a rise of, say, 40MB split across 144MB of blocks is somewhere around 0.3MB/block of extra transactions that aren't fitting in.
I don't know that I'd be so quick to call that an attack.  It could be a genuine spike in transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:44:12
So why not remove the block limit entirely, making it infinitely expensive for spam attacks to happen?
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:31:14
Bitcoin needs a lot more market presence to avoid an alt-coin takeover in the future.  Crypto as a whole is still such an infant market with lots of room for a newcomer to grab market share.
100MB blocks would probably make Bitcoin the safe winner of the crypto race.  10MB might.  1MB most certainly will not.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:07:19
It's funny because I felt the same way about the core crowd, how they so blindly support blockstream's vision of bitcoin, not satoshi's vision of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:06:29
It's a horrible approach.  The network can handle 20MB blocks TODAY.  Why not update it to take advantage of 20MB blocks then?
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:41:59


I'd argue against that.  None of the other stuff is possible without Bitcoin acting as a currency.  The economic incentive for miners to secure the blockchain depends entirely on Bitcoin as a currency, nothing else.  So it is not "one of its possible use cases," it is the most important use case.
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:58:34

As if we wouldn't have a bunch of people developing based on BU if it became the new standard?  Do you think people would just ignore it and no one would jump in to help?
I'm willing to put faith in amateurs because the "pros" don't see to have my best interests in mind.  They seem to have corporate interests in mind.  What else am I supposed to do when I feel as though a corporation has taken over bitcoin and the vision I once had of it is fading?  I don't think maintaining the block size limit so small is the right way to go, so if amateurs are the only ones willing to change that, that's who I'll follow.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:41:58
Why not?  Miners are in a perfect position to dictate block size constraints.  Their entire operation is dependent on the price of bitcoin, so they won't do anything to harm that price.  Whatever they do, it will be focused entirely on increasing growth and usability of bitcoin while still protecting the decentralization that is so important to it.
And if you don't believe me, just look at what happened with deepbit.  They voluntarily gave up hashpower ($$$) by increasing fees to ridiculous levels once they reached a dangerously high percentage of the overall hash power of the network.  They didn't do this out of the goodness of their heart - they did it because bitcoin would be in danger otherwise, and that would directly affect their future profits via the price dropping.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:30:53
You have to remember that many users are using 3rd party services to store their Bitcoins.  I know it isn't recommended by all the hardcore BTC users, but most people don't want to deal with storing Bitcoins on their own.  So they don't.
But Coinbase probably only has a handful of addresses they're using to store coins for tens or hundreds of thousands of users.  That's something you're not going to see via these address distribution charts.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:34:50


Do you have proof of that?  I've seen the opposite to be true.  Segwit-ready doesn't mean endorsement of segwit, and more and more people and businesses are recognizing the need for larger blocks today, not years down the road.




Completely agree.  It'll be interesting to see how this ends up playing out, but the incentives will keep the miners from doing anything stupid.
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:57:10
I can't think of any circumstance where that would be true that wouldn't also be applicable to Bitcoin mining as it stands today.
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:56:58


Sure - why not drop to 100kb blocks while we're at it?  Less centralization, yay!
The whole damn train is about to fall apart because there IS no working solution for Bitcoin going above capacity yet.  We don't have segwit yet (it is still many months out, and benefits will only be gained when others reprogram their software to work with it anyway), we don't have LN or any other layers yet (not that I even trust blockstream devs to have our best interests at heart anyway), so we need a blocksize increase to keep Bitcoin going for now.
When those other solutions are in place, sure, let's use them!  But for now, we're in for a world of hurt if adoption continues to grow and the blocksize does not.  2MB is going to help Bitcoin more than it will hurt it, and that's the whole point.  I agree there is a delicate balance and we need to be careful, but 2MB isn't going to cause centralization anywhere near the point of being a concern.
On top of this, extra headroom is a good thing.  I remember watching adoption increase almost 10-fold in the matter of a month back in 2011 and again 4-fold or so in 2013.  It's going to happen again, and if we're relying on segwit to carry us through, we're going to be sorely disappointed.  People WILL be turned away from using Bitcoin if their first experience is terrible.  I just want to avoid that happening.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:29:45


All the more reason that we should hardfork ONCE to remove the blocksize limit entirely so that we won't have to go through this again in the future.
Seriously, remove the blocksize limit and I will fully support and applaud other scaling solutions being built.  I know many other BU-supporters feel the same way.  I just don't like the way that SW/LN is forced on us as the ONLY possible scaling solution.  The market should decide which scaling solutions are best and to what capacity they should be used, not a dictatorship built from a corporation.

@_date: 2017-03-17 03:54:08
Or just give a blocksize increase.  I mean, most of the BU people aren't against segwit on anything but principle.  Show some leeway in blocksize and you'll get a lot more support for segwit.

Compact blocks (xthin blocks) already solved the problem of "can't get blocks fast enough" for very large blocks though, that's an old argument.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:53:02
1)  If we can't trust the majority of miners to do what is in their own economic interest then we can't trust bitcoin at all.
2) No, but that is something that is easily coded in.  If validation takes longer than 15 seconds then it is deemed an attack block, so dump it.  Miners could signal other miners what their acceptable validation time limits in the block coinbase, and a miner would not mine a block greater than the median of those signaled limits.
3)  Again, that is something that is easily coded in.  The chain cannot be stalled in this way.
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:16:05
Adoption is a great way to achieve technical progress.  As more people use Bitcoin, and as Bitcoin becomes more valuable, more investments are going to be made in code built for and around Bitcoin.
I would argue that hindering adoption in the name of technical progress is actually hindering technical progress itself.
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:36:45


Hah!  Do you REALLY have your head stuck that far in the sand?  
Of course the current blocksize is detrimental to bitcoin!  People have stuck transactions that take days or never actually confirm!  They have resorted to using a transaction accelerator and even that is out of capacity after just a few minutes every hour!  And the accelerator is only pushing out more transactions that are waiting to confirm!  You can't use bitcoin for anything time-sensitive right now, because you don't know when it'll actually confirm.
I cannot seriously believe that there are still people out there that don't think Bitcoin is completely broken right now.
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:34:04
This sort of issue doesn't technically have to be fixed for larger blocks.  A miner naturally won't accept a block that takes longer than 10 minutes to verify, so any "attack" blocks will simply be orphaned.  In fact, miners would probably set a much lower limit on verification times, maybe 1 or 2 minutes at most.  They could signal support for a certain verification time limit as well so that other miners have a general idea of consensus and don't accidentally create a block that takes too long to verify.
That said, I agree the problem should be fixed anyway (who doesn't love more efficient ways of doing things??), just that it doesn't HAVE to be done before larger blocks, and I wouldn't be calling anyone reckless for supporting larger blocks because of it.

If that's the case, then they would keep the blocksize the same or make it smaller.  So no block cap would be necessary, right?

I take a different viewpoint - the unreliability and slowness of transactions right now due to limited blockspace is putting a damper on the bitcoin rally.  In fact, I've even seen the market bump up in the past on pro-BU news being released.  But you know, that's probably nothing, right?  ;)

I realize that, but the easier we make it for people to do this, the more people will abuse it.  Right now there is hardly any 0-conf abuse.  It seems to be a newsworthy event when it happens.  I can buy a $100 gift card from egifter and use it immediately before the transaction is confirmed.  I don't want to lose that ability, and if RBF becomes commonplace, I will.  "Crimes of opportunity" and all of that.  If you leave your keys in your car, someone is more likely to steal it than if you have your keys in your house.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:11:23

It'll help a tremendous amount while bitcoin is still in these early growth stages.  I know it isn't a permanent scaling solution, at least with today's technology, but it would help bitcoin continue to be usable by the people who want to use it today, and it would provide *some* room for continued growth.  We need to encourage more people to get into bitcoin to ensure its success.  We can't do that right now with how unreliable and expensive transactions are.
All of that said, I agree that vulnerabilities need to be fixed.  I agree that things like segwit should be implemented to prepare for L2 solutions.  I just don't believe that L2 should be the ONLY solution, or the forced solution.  The market should be allowed to choose.

@_date: 2017-03-06 22:38:50
I want BU because I don't think we should have to hard fork again in the future to increase the limit.  If we do a 2MB today, then we have to hard fork again to get 3MB or 4MB or whatever is agreed upon in the future.  I think there is no question that the block size will (and should) continue to increase as better hardware and technology allows it.
And yes, I agree that SegWit is only loosely tied to the... you know.  But I guess my rejection of it is my way of showing my displeasure with those policies.  Whatever my enemy supports, I reject.  Something like that anyway.  Once this whole political war is over, I'd be happy to support SegWit and any other good additions to the protocol that aren't forced upon us.

I've been in bitcoin since 2011.  The bitcoin we have today is not the bitcoin I signed up for.  That's why I want to see change.  I want to see no hard-coded block size limits and miners who soft-limit the blocksize themselves.

@_date: 2017-03-07 00:19:03


Do you have proof of this?  From everything I've seen, markets want BU, not segwit and corporate-owned 2nd layers.  The market bumps up whenever there is pro-BU news.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:03:01
So other people's problems using bitcoin don't matter?  As long as you can do what you want to do, it's all A-Okay?
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:15:12
I was pro-blocksize-increase before even existed.  I haven't drank any koolaid, it's simply the logical progression to increase the blocksize if we want to see bitcoin grow.
I always pose this question and it always goes unanswered:  If smaller blocks are better, why don't we DECREASE the blocksize?  Why not 100kb blocks?  Or 10kb blocks?  Then ANYONE can run a node!
Anyway, BU would work fine.  Miners have plenty of incentive not to ruin the network.  SegWit and LN can still happen with an uncapped blocksize, they'll just have to stand on their own merit instead of being forced as the only scaling solution.  I see this as a good thing.
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:38:52


That's easy to fix - other miners can ignore and forcefully orphan rogue blocks like that.  We don't need to set the limit ourselves.

@_date: 2017-03-06 21:29:35
I'm pro-big-blocks.  I reject SegWit simply because of how they went about trying to put it in place.  I don't like all of the lies, deception, propaganda, and especially censo rship (pretty sure my comment gets auto-banned if I type that whole word out).  If this sub would allow full discussions about scaling, not just one-sided conversations, then I'd probably feel differently.  But the bad taste that is left in my mouth from the censo rship here makes me want to auto-reject anything that this group of people puts forth.  It doesn't seem right to have things forced upon us instead of properly discussed.
That said, if BU eventually happens, I'd be fine with SegWit being added in as well.  I don't like the forced scaling though.  If LN is truly that good, then it can happen along with soft-limited block sizes.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:51:21
Most empty blocks are made simply because the miners do not have all the info they need yet to mine a block with transactions shortly after a previous block had been found.  Yes, you'll have some rogue actors here and there but I'm speaking generically.
If a single miner "goes rogue" and mines a block too large, other miners will simply ignore/orphan it.  Miners will actively signal to each other what blocksize is acceptable and the median of that signaling will likely be the settled upon blocksize limit.

Merchants (with few exceptions) are not going to be running their own nodes.  They will rely on their wallet provider/payment processor to tell them if they have been paid or not.  You can be sure that every wallet/payment provider (unless they are trying to scam their users) will very quickly switch to the majority fork if large blocks end up more popular than small blocks.
Merchants who DO run their own node are already techie enough that they know about this debate and will decide to accept coins on one chain or the other.

@_date: 2017-03-07 00:23:14
Still crickets, the question remains unanswered.  :D
Anyway, I'd really be fine with SegWit if BU followed soon after or was hard forked at the same time.  I don't like the idea that SegWit/LN is the ONLY way to scale.  I think the markets should be free to choose how to scale, by not having a block size limit and by being free to build 2nd layer solutions on top of bitcoin.  Having both options available will bring about the best solutions.
But I think blockstream is fearful that they will only be able to make a profit with their 2nd layer solution if bitcoin itself remains very limited, so they will just continue to keep it limited using whatever means necessary (including censo rship).  If bitcoin has more space so that transactions fees remain low, why would anyone want to or need to use a 2nd layer?
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:39:53

If 75% of the hashpower decides BU is a good idea (and thus initiates the fork), I bet the markets will follow.  It would be downright weird if they didn't, but... time will tell.

@_date: 2017-03-07 05:05:18
It's not a hard-fork over and over again, I'm not sure why you think that.  Here's how it would work in practice, and it's really quite simple:
All miners would signal whatever block size they would like to have.  The breakdown might look something like this:
1MB - 10%
2MB - 35%
4MB - 30%
6MB - 20%
8MB - 5%
Miners would simply choose the median block size to mine at, which in this case would be 4MB.  Blocks could be smaller than that, but all miners would have to accept that size of block to participate in the network.  If a miner tried to mine a larger block, such as 6MB, they take a risk that the majority of hashpower will simply orphan their oversized block.

Cheap transactions and funding the network entirely by transaction fees don't have to be mutually exclusive - we just need more transactions.  Problem is, more transactions = bigger blocks and core doesn't want to do that, and they're in control.

That doesn't really make sense.  Nodes can be easily sybil'd, so why would a business look at the number of nodes as any kind of indicator?  They would more likely listen to direct user feedback before a fork, and after a fork they would likely follow whatever the market followed.

Really?  Because 3 years ago, blocks were still hovering around the 100KB mark.  And we've had a 10x increase since then, with no "interesting solution that prevents ugly effects network-wise."
The thing is, people can speculate all they want, but until we actually TRY bigger blocks, we won't know what the true effects will be.  And we certainly weren't afraid to go from 100kb to 1mb, why are we afraid of the arbitrary 1mb limit?

Yes, and how many people are no longer using Bitcoin because confirmations are unreliable now?  How many people are no longer using Bitcoin because fees are untenable now?

Two separate situations.  The unbanked cannot use Bitcoin anymore because it is too expensive, steam gamers cannot buy $0.17 games anymore because it'd be ridiculous to pay a fee higher than the price of the item itself.


What I don't get is WHY?  Why are we forcing these things off the blockchain when they could both help adoption of Bitcoin and help the public image of Bitcoin?  I don't care what world you live in but HIGHER FEES ARE NOT A GOOD THING.
I'm not for trying to keep fees below a certain limit.  I'm for eliminating the hardcoded block size limit and allowing the free market to decide what the appropriate fee and block size is without inducing artificial limits on it.
We could immediately reduce fees and allow many more people to use Bitcoin by raising the block size.  But the corrupt group of people in charge won't let that happen because it'll hurt their future profits in the lightning network project.  And somehow they've gotten people like you so convinced of this as to become advocates for them.

There are variable costs.  Risk of orphaning is a big one, disk space is another, CPU and RAM are others, but even beyond that is price risk.  If miners act in the interest of the community, they will see the bitcoin price increase, and therefore their profits will increase.  If miners do not act in the interest of the community, price will decrease, and their profits will decrease.  This is an indirect cost, but a cost nonetheless, and it should and does drive miners to generally do things (such as mining) that are beneficial to the bitcoin ecosystem.  An artificial limit only serves to constrain the effective finding of the optimal blocksize.

It's also odd that 1MB is a magical number.  If we're concerned about centralization, why isn't the blocksize reduced even more?  Why don't we have 100kb blocks or 10kb blocks?  What makes 1mb the perfect blocksize?

That doesn't mean unconfirmed transactions are useless for transacting, or that they aren't used.  You're arguing word definitions while blindly ignoring the facts that bitcoin is used TODAY and has been used for YEARS with unconfirmed transactions.
Sure, merchants are trusting the user to not double-spend, but when the user doesn't have the option to double-spend directly in their client, they are going to be much less likely to do so.  Especially so when you consider how many people would just give you a blank stare when you mention "python script."  Very few people have the technical capabilities to actually pull off a double-spend today vs simply checking a box if RBF was fully implemented by everyone.

That's entirely up to each of them individually.  But if you think about it, obviously there would be incredible risk to accepting a block that other miners would potentially reject, so all miners would constantly be monitoring the network to see what size of blocks other miners are accepting and set their own size in line with it.  It would probably take a group effort to make the change to a larger blocksize at any given time, but that would certainly be better than having to hard fork each time a bigger block size was needed.

But beyond all of that, what really pisses me off is that a group of people have been able to commandeer the Bitcoin project and basically become dictators of how it is run.  They will profit from Bitcoin fees being high with their future lightning network project, but for some reason this gigantic conflict of interest doesn't bother a lot of people.  
They've convinced people that 1MB is the magical limit and going beyond it would destroy Bitcoin, which that couldn't be further from the truth.  It'll make them a hell of a lot of money though when they start rolling in the dough for fees through the lightning network when those fees should have been going to the miners.  Just like mass media, they are great at pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.

If it's under $100 or so, most merchants seem fine with 0-conf.  Or at least did until blocks got full.  I routinely bought gift cards through e-gifter and gyft in-store and used them minutes after sending the bitcoin, no confirmations needed.  It's honor-based, sure, but that works most of the time, enough that it isn't worth inconveniencing the customer to ensure 100% fraud-proofing.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:44:07


I hope you are right.  I probably don't know enough about it to see that this is the case but no one has been able to explain how it wouldn't work that way yet.


But that's just it - it is an assumption to say that it WOULD have disastrous side effects!  We've tested larger blocks, no disasters happened.


We could have a market for block sizes if the cap was removed.  Miners wouldn't want to mine blocks too large or they risk getting orphaned, both from rejection due to other miners or nodes not accepting it because of the size and also from transmission time.  The way I see it, if we run into problems with larger blocks, we can scale it back.  If the miners refuse to scale it back, we can force it (as a community) by saying the only valid chain is one with blocks no larger than X MB as of 12/5/2016.  I just see lots of ways we can fix bitcoin if it becomes broken due to block size, so it doesn't concern me to remove the cap and more-or-less bump around to find out what the truly practical upper limit should be.
I hate the idea that we are wasting bitcoin's potential by turning away new users right now.  There is no more room for new people to join.  Or if new people do join and are willing to pay the fees, they're pushing someone else's transactions out.  That just seems stupid when the network can very clearly support larger blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:47:12
Bitcoin would be incredibly easy to tax with how traceable it is.  All you need is a small percentage of the population to report their transactions and the rest can be figured out from that info.  They already have big threats for misreporting information, so couple that fear with making it very public knowledge how easy it is to trace, and you'll have nearly full compliance in no time.

Beyond that I think you're taking the quote wrong anyway.  He doesn't clarify whether he is talking about volume of value or volume of transactions, and I take it to mean the former.  Given that assumption, his vision wouldn't disclude low-value transactions, he's just saying that most of the value moved would be moved by people with lots of money.

The same way you express your preference for anything protocol related today - either run a node with those preferences or write about your opinion in some public place where miners and noders (if that's not a word it should be) can see it.  But ultimately it is up to the miners to set those preferences, and the only way non-miners can reject it is to simply not use that chain if they disagree.


This part is quite simple actually.  Each miner suggests the max block size they are willing to accept via the coinbase text whenever they mine a block.  Other miners can quickly see where the 51% support level is (i.e. at least 51% of miners will accept a block of 4MB, but only 35% will accept 8MB).  It would be stupid of a miner to mine a 20MB block in such a case, as it would simply be rejected by the other miners.  Not to mention that the same propagation delay you speak of also gives a much greater chance of that block being orphaned, so that counters most of the "overwhelming advantage" of finding the next block anyway.
Beyond that, miners need bitcoin to succeed anyway.  They aren't going to continue mining gigantic blocks if it is obviously detrimental to the community, because price drops mean their profits are wiped away.  The value of bitcoin is a very real market force that the community can use to voice their opinion about problematic miners.


I agree that experts need to be analyzing this.  Problem is, most of the experts around are employed by companies with interests that conflict with bitcoin.  How can we trust anyone from blockstream when their company plan is built around making sure bitcoin doesn't scale on its own?


We already HAVE negative side effects from the artificial blocksize limit, and they are getting worse every day.  They are pushing people away from bitcoin and giving it a bad name.  I'd rather fix the problem at hand than worry about potential problems that we don't even know will happen and can be fixed if they do.

It's so weird to see a post like this from the "other side".  When I saw what you posted, I immediately thought that you were a big-blocker and we were fighting against greg/etc.  Because that's truly the way I (and others in see it - we're fighting against the evil corp who has taken over bitcoin.
I'm just speaking for myself, but I've been a long-time bitcoin user (since 2011).  But what I see now is not what was envisioned from the original Bitcoin paper, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  The refusal to allow for larger blocks just shows that bitcoin (in its current state) will NOT be used by the average person, instead the average person will use services on top and it won't end up being much different from the current banking system.
I'm not sure why the fact that blockstream is financed by large banks doesn't bother so many of you here.  Why would a large bank want Bitcoin to succeed?  It makes me immediately suspicious of the motivations of blockstream.  But beyond that, blockstream only makes money if Bitcoin doesn't work as originally intended, if they can get people to use their new service instead of the bitcoin blockchain itself.
Why doesn't that bother people, that blockstream is so influential on the direction of development of bitcoin, yet they have such a glaring conflict of interest when it comes to how bitcoin is used?  Of course they are going to claim that we cannot safely increase the blocksize because they only make money if we can't use bitcoin itself.  I don't like to call people shills or paid or whatever, but it really confuses me that so many people just accept this company as being ok without questioning their actions or motivations.
And then there's the unsolved decentralized routing problem with LN that no one seems to have an answer for.
Finally the censorship on is pretty over-the-top.  We can't even discuss alternatives without fear of getting banned.  Again, this just makes me more suspicious of the motivations of those doing the censoring.  If the alternatives truly sucked, why would we need to censor discussion of them?  Especially on a place like reddit?  Shouldn't those alternatives naturally fade away if they are terrible?
I don't know.  I'm just an average guy who knows a decent amount about tech and computers.  But it seems to me like blockstream has essentially commandeered bitcoin.  It seems they are bent on neutering it by sticking with the low block size limit so that they can either keep it from being a real threat to banks or build their own banking service on top of bitcoin.

Because everyone who uses bitcoin agrees that that is the rule.  If anyone tries to go outside of that rule and make more than 21 million or make them faster than they are set to be made, everyone else's computers just ignore them automatically.

That's where we are at right now.  I have a feeling that if companies became truly serious about dumping money into bitcoin-related development, things would begin moving much more quickly.

I don't see how everyone WOULDN'T congregate to a single LN node though.  If a person or business has to "lock up" money in a node in order to use it, then why would they want to use more than one node?  What's more, if a company is looking at what node they should use, why wouldn't they choose the node with the most potential customers on it (i.e. the biggest node)?  So that being the case, wouldn't everyone join the same node and we're suddenly not decentralized at all?
I'm not a super technical person so I'm probably missing something, but I haven't heard a good explanation of why this wouldn't be the case.
But beyond all of that, I still feel as though the market should CHOOSE to use LN, rather than be forced to use it via high block fees.  I don't like the situation that we are in where we essentially have a corporation telling us what bitcoin should be, instead of us being able to choose what bitcoin should be.  It shouldn't be a dictatorship, and that's what it feels like (with communications channels censored and core development owned).
You say that nobody has to use it but what other choice will we have in the near future?  Fees are already getting ridiculous and people are just plain stopping their use of bitcoin now.  So the choice will be to either use lightning network or not use bitcoin at all?  Not much of a choice...
Make block sizes unlimited, then miners and node-owners will decide the optimal size of blocks via soft consensus.  If small blocks are truly valuable, then blocks will remain small.  The more people we have actually using bitcoin, the more valuable it will be to run a node, so it is not necessarily true that larger blocks = fewer nodes.  We already have many multiples of the number of nodes needed to keep the network secure anyway.
I agree that we can't reach visa levels of transactions on just the blockchain today, but if we scale up at a moderate pace, we eventually will be able to.  And the free market should be that moderating force, not a small group of people in control of the codebase.  Miners won't mine blocks that are too big or they'll be shooting themselves in the foot.
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:23:14
But most of your friends and family do not need to run a node.  They do need to pay for transactions though.
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:16:00
Everyone keeps saying that bandwidth is the issue, but.... why?  Sure, not everyone will be able to run a node, but even in the US, a place with notoriously slow internet, there are millions of users with 100/10mbps internet connections available, and hundreds of thousands of users with gigabit as an option.  I don't see bandwidth as being a problem myself.
10mbps running for 10 minutes = 750MB of data.  That's an 8MB block relayed 93 times, or a 50MB block relayed 15 times.
That is PLENTY for a sizeable block increase, especially considering that not everyone needs to run a node.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:34:41
But it will grow linearly as Bitcoin value grows, so... if people are thinking Bitcoins will be worth $40k in the future, then the network can be expected to consume nearly 200x as much electricity as it is now.

[How about this?](
To me, a list that long with such large numbers in such a short period of time makes it pretty obvious that anyone handling other people's Bitcoins should be thoroughly analyzed/vetted/regulated, and that seems to be exactly what the BitLicense aims to do.
Now I know it is expensive and that it means unfunded startups absolutely will not be able to comply, but that's a good thing in my book.  I don't want some mom's-basement coders handling my money, and neither should you.

The big pools (51%+) would talk amongst each other and come to an agreement of some sort.  Everyone else would have to follow suit or be left behind.  It's really not difficult to imagine...
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:44:39
Alright, you want explanations?  Fine, I can give explanations.
They could coordinate via email.  Or reddit.  I don't care.  It's called communication, and how they decide to do it doesn't matter.
It might be somewhat counter to decentralization, but what's the alternative?  Let a group of 5 guys with questionable motives decide for us instead?  Wait for a year before the next hardfork and split in the community can proceed?  The core devs don't care about the community anyway.
Besides, the actions of the pools will be public, and people mining for those pools can opt to move to one they agree with.  So it's more of a vote of all miners than just big ones, despite the big ones making an initial agreement.  And if pools opted to go against what the community as a whole wanted, they'd be outed and ostracized.  They'd likely change their mind too, because a happy community = a healthy price, and that is ultimately what every pool and miner is concerned about.
And yes, the consensus could change rapidly.  That doesn't really matter either since it doesn't require a change in software and no one will be hard-forked out of using Bitcoin.  In fact, we WANT consensus to be able to change rapidly so we're not left in the cold if a big adoption wave hits and we have some arbitrary limit on blocks that cannot accommodate the influx in users.  Leaving things flexible and adjustable where we can is the best thing to do since we cannot predict the future.
It doesn't need to happen at the protocol level.
It is a viable solution.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:17:32


Well I agree with that, but there are many competent coders in this community, and rest assured, if Bitcoin is ever in any danger of being "controlled", they will spring into action.

@_date: 2015-08-14 21:23:43


I really want to agree with you, but find I cannot.  If a startup cannot find enough funding to pay for licensing fees as small as $5k, they really shouldn't be handling my money or anyone else's.

Yep, regulations are definitely not needed in the Bitcoin space.  [It's completely safe]( I swear!
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:28:33
To me, it is the core devs who are throwing the tantrums of stubbornness.  They refuse to give larger blocks a chance when it is quite clear the vast majority of the Bitcoin community wants them.  Mike Hearn left because the other devs aren't being reasonable.
In my mind, if I have to pick one, XT IS Bitcoin, and the core no longer is.  Because XT is actually following what the people who use Bitcoin want.  But really, I still view both of them as being "Bitcoin" at this point, just differing versions of it.
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:41:10
Thanks, this'll do the trick.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:07:21
In my opinion, the  reason for a proposal such as BIP101 to be implemented immediately is because of the sudden and sometimes exponential growth in Bitcoin adoption.
We've seen incredible growth in a short period of time in the past, and there's no good reason to think that it won't happen again.  If Bitcoin's userbase increased 10 fold overnight, it would be an absolute mess.  Blocks would be completely filled, transactions would take hours or days or even weeks to confirm, and it would put most of those new people off of using Bitcoin forever.
Lightning network isn't anywhere close to ready.  The best solution we have at this point is to give ourselves a very large amount of overhead via blocksize, as much as we can practically do with current hardware.  Otherwise we're in for a world of hurt when the next wave of adoption hits.
We wouldn't have to use up all of that 8MB of space in the blocks.  Miners can choose to self-regulate, only including transactions with reasonable fees.  The 8MB could be treated as surge space for the most part.

One enormous block every once in a while isn't going to make a huge difference.  If it's really much of a problem, miners can soft-fork to avoid very large blocks anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:58:48
And that's a lot of money, I agree.  But at the same time, if someone is going to be handling other people's money, I want them to have put much more than that amount of money into their own security and audits to ensure things are going as they should.  So if they can't afford $250k, it's probably not a company I want to be handling my money anyway, because they also can't afford appropriate security to go alongside it.

I just don't see a way that a mining pool could possibly pull off such an attack without people figuring out who it is.  It is easy enough to follow the coins in Bitcoin, and if miners in the pool were not paid for two blocks they found, they would know - it is not possible for a pool to steal blocks from its users without them knowing.
And it IS costly to attack - any person who is running a very successful mining pool like that has obviously invested an incredible amount of time and probably money in keeping it up.  So they're going to potentially throw that all away to reverse a single block?  For what benefit?  Financial?  It would be a waste!  Even if they were able to double-spend, I can't think of a single useful way to do it with only one confirmation to merit a large enough financial gain to carry out such an attack.  What are they going to do?  Buy a car with it?  Trade for a significant bank transfer?  Exchange for cash in person?  It's not going to be a large enough amount of money to make such an effort worthwhile, especially given the risk of being found out and losing your pool population entirely.  You can't just hide block after block from your miner users in the hopes that you'll get two in a row so you can conduct a double-spend attack.
I get the feeling you've never actually been involved in serious mining on a pool, because it sure seems like you don't understand how much the miners in a pool analyze things like block statistics and probabilities.
@_date: 2015-07-30 08:09:56

You may be mistaken.  I read a long time back that the first block didn't have a private key associated with the output address, so those coins are unspendable (and he wouldn't be able to sign a message with that private key either).  But I'm not sure how much truth there is to that either.

It's not for any small business that wants to accept Bitcoin for purchases.  It's only for businesses that store/handle other people's Bitcoins.  That's the idea of the BitLicense - to require that companies who handle other people's money are very careful with it and will not just run off with it or allow it to be stolen.  Despite the banter you hear on its purpose actually is to protect consumers and users.

It doesn't matter.  You can't conduct a sybil attack to cover up discrepancies like "oh hey, 6 blocks were just reversed by mining pool XXXX".  That's not going to happen.

A sybil problem is just nonsense in this context.

Plenty of people worldwide have such a connection as it is already.  And if there are enough transactions to warrant 8GB (!!!!) blocks, then Bitcoin will be in a stage of adoption far far greater than we can even imagine right now.  There will be people who are at that point Bitcoin millionaires and billionaires who would have no problem investing a few thousand in significant hardware to ensure their investment in Bitcoin is safe.  Not to mention the many many businesses involved at that point that might also be interested in making sure they have a full copy of the blockchain themselves.  Not to mention how much the software and hardware surrounding Bitcoin overall will have changed by that point anyway.
Really, it's kind of a moot point to be discussing 8GB blocks with today's adoption levels and software/hardware tech.  Bitcoin will look so different by the time we're actually filling blocks of that size.

I can guarantee that the moment anyone starts breaking down doors to kill bitcoin nodes is the moment that 10x the number of nodes appear on the network.

That's not true of all.  If I never install the XT client, I would never be on the XT chain at soon as that chain started mining blocks larger than 1MB.  It doesn't matter if 99% of hash power is mining on the XT chain, I would still be on the blockchain that I choose.  No miners could force me (or anyone else) to change the version of Bitcoin I am using.
In truth, it is the Bitcoin user majority who controls which version of Bitcoin will be used.  If Bitcoin forks, users will very quickly decide which chain is more valuable and attempt to sell off their coins on the other chain.  This will cause a precipitous drop in value to zero for that other chain, solidifying the fork that everyone is now holding on to.  And miners follow value - they won't continue to mine on a chain that nets them nothing anymore.  They will quickly switch to whichever fork gives them the most BTC for their hashes.

I'd love to agree with you in that, but the past 6 years of unregulated activity has shown time and time again that this just doesn't work.  People are still getting scammed, amateur services are still getting hacked and losing coins, etc.  So I must, with a heavy sigh, agree with the government that close monitoring of any company handling other people's money is a good thing.  Because reputation alone just doesn't cut it when there's this much money on the line.
Now I'm not saying the BitLicense is perfect or that it is even good, but that I believe some regulations need to be in place to ensure the people in charge of financial companies will not be running off with other people's money and that they have top-notch security measures in place, both locally and online.

At first definitely, but as Bitcoin becomes more popular and sellers continue to be fed up with the current marketplaces, they're going to look for alternatives.  A free marketplace where they cannot be banned, limited, or have funds frozen sounds pretty damn good in comparison with what's currently out there.  
This is way bigger than Bitcoin saving merchants 3% on transactions vs credit cards.  This is merchants saving 12%-40% of revenue.  This is merchants not having to worry about living comfortably one day and then suddenly losing 80% of their income the next because they were banned without warning.  This is merchants not having thousands of dollars of money they really need tied up in a website who arbitrarily deemed them a risk.
Bitcoin is the point of friction.  But as it and OB become more popular, OB will gain momentum.  OB isn't going to go anywhere.  It's not going to ever be shut down, because there's nothing to shut down.  It'll persist indefinitely just like Bitcoin will, and that will only serve to aid in its attractiveness.

If you want a dynamic fee market, just let users set the fees to begin with.  And give them tools to determine estimated time-to-inclusion of transactions into blocks.

sha256 will definitely be broken eventually, which is fine.  There will probably be people building machines to race to find the private key for those "unspendable coins".  The limit is still 21 million bitcoins total.  But we won't have to move to a different crypto because of it - Bitcoin can be changed to use a different hash.
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:23:20
I oppose forcing people to use LN (through artificially high fees due to artificially low block size limits) instead of allowing them to choose between using the blockchain and using a 2nd layer tech.
I oppose the stagnation of growth of bitcoin due to block size limitations when LN still has unsolved issues and it is clear that a real implementation is many years down the line.
I oppose allowing a handful of people to dictate what bitcoin should and should not be instead of allowing the free market to choose what it should be.  There should be no block size limit and the free market should be allowed to settle on a soft limit, and that soft limit will naturally increase over time as technology allows it to do so.
I oppose allowing the dev team to be mostly composed of and controlled by a single corp who has received tens of millions of dollars of investment money from the very banks that we are trying to escape from.
These are the reasons that I oppose the lightning network.  I know there are many others with similar thoughts/feelings and this shouldn't amaze anyone.

We've had nearly 10x growth in Bitcoin transactions in one month back in 2011, and nearly 4x growth in a similar time period in 2013.  Less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the world's population currently uses Bitcoin.  And yet you say that it won't come to blocks getting full?
What kind of rock are you living under that you can completely deny the possibility that adoption will outpace segwit?
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:02:47
I don't quite understand this.  Is it really that difficult to determine which transactions currently in mempool are now in a new block?  Seems like that comparison should take milliseconds.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:50:23
The biggest issue is that confirmation times are going to skyrocket.  Not only are blocks already full, but suddenly they're going to be only every 20 minutes instead of every 10 minutes.  So we're effectively halving the number of transactions that can be processed on the Bitcoin network for a full month.
It'll be great!
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:51:43
Except bigger blocks would be 2MB, SegWit only offers a maximum of 1.7MB and that's only after EVERYONE starts using it.  Who knows how long it'll take for implementation in the variety of wallets and software out there.
Bigger blocks are still a better bet for maintaining a healthy Bitcoin network.  SegWit should be done too, but we shouldn't rely solely on it.
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:05:43

By the time SegWit is actually implemented we'll already need more space than it provides.  Blocks are already full, we should have increased the blocksize a month ago.

@_date: 2016-02-04 18:01:11
Why?  Blocks are basically full at this point.  If we have any significant adoption from here on out, transactions are going to start taking hours or days to confirm.  Or be stuck in limbo forever.  It's going to turn people away from using Bitcoin left and right.  We need some headroom in the block size, otherwise reality is going to give us a swift kick in the head.  We can't wait until we need the room, because by then it is too late.
We can't rely on segwit because it is unknown who is going to adopt it or how quickly they will do so.  It's going to require a lot of reprogramming, and that's an expense that some Bitcoin companies might not be willing to proceed with.  Or at the very least, they'll delay it.  We could see very little actual benefit from segwit for quite a while.
What is wrong with a 2MB fork now and getting segwit going when it is ready as well?
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:05:10
Yeah I didn't say it wasn't going to affect miners, just that the block reward is going to remain significant for quite some time.
But let's face it - the only way miners will be able to secure the network in the future is if Bitcoin is used by at least tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people.  Otherwise there just isn't enough money in it.  And if Bitcoin can't support that many users (whether through the core protocol or through additional layers), then it is doomed.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:24:41
Consensus has been made among a large enough group of miners/developers that the minority is effectively shut out at this point.  So there isn't consensus among the whole Bitcoin community, just among a select group of people who get to make decisions for us about the future of Bitcoin.

On the flip side of the coin, I'd rather see 100 million transactions pay $0.05 each than 1 million transactions pay $5 each.  Yes, a fee market can and should eventually develop, but no, we shouldn't do it artificially by keeping the block size low.  A large number of people can support miners with low fees just as well as a small number of people with large fees.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:59:03
The best way to ensure enough fees to support the miners is to have enough users to support the miners.  It would be a lot better to have 100M people pay $0.05 each than to have 1M people pay $5 each.
@_date: 2016-02-18 20:44:48

You're assuming I'm not a miner?
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:46:39
Yes they do.  I choose no blocksize myself.
@_date: 2016-02-18 20:25:19
Why's that?
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:14:57
True.  It could be reduced by more than half though and be even worse.
Simplified example:  If 75% of miners pay $0.03/kwh for electricity, and make $0.04 of BTC for every $0.03/kwh of electricity spent, then 75% of the hashpower is going to be shut off the moment the reward halving happens.  No miner is going to mine at a loss.
It all depends on how thin the profit margins are for miners and how many of them fall above or below the breakeven point when their revenue is slashed in half.
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:52:23
Ehhh, I disagree with holding back the blocksize to the lowest common denominator.  Should we revert to 100kb blocks so that we're not discluding any other countries with even worse internet?  Surely Chinese miners would find a solution to their bandwidth problem if faced with the possibility of losing the ability to mine.
I also don't agree with the "too cheap" argument.  Bitcoin SHOULD be cheap.  Otherwise we're discluding a large part of the world from even using it, because $0.25 to us is quite a lot more to other people.
On top of that, there's still no solution for if blocks become full.  People say "well just add more fees to your txs".  Well that's fine on paper, but in practice, people won't add enough fees, then their money is stuck in limbo for who knows how long before they can finally get a double-spend through to fix it.  It'll ruin Bitcoin if we let blocks get full.
@_date: 2016-02-04 16:16:57
And?  They're still trying to hinder Bitcoin by keeping the blocksize small so that it loses its practical use.  Otherwise, who will use their wonderful lightning product?
I'm not against lightning BTW.  I think it could be a great layer on top of Bitcoin.  I AM against keeping the blocksize lower than the network can handle.  And I'm even more against that when people have a personal financial interest in doing so.
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:32:33
Well of course it'll be detrimental to miners.  I'm not sure what your point is.  The network will still be protected, it'll just be protected by half the hashpower it used to be.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:22:07

@_date: 2016-02-03 19:10:34
How is blockstream going to generate revenue from those trustless solutions?  From fees?  So you're going to hinder Bitcoin itself by keeping the blocksize small to be able to generate fees from a layer on top of it?
This is why I don't trust you.
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:13:06
Oh, good question.  I always assumed it did, but maybe it feasibly cannot.  That'd be great though - a Bitcoin marketplace that didn't pander to illegal goods!

@_date: 2016-02-18 20:47:15
Yes but it is illegal with serious consequences if you are caught.  Plus it costs money and it's only temporary.  I don't see too many sellers venturing into that territory, but it could happen from time to time.
For small-time sellers selling board games or some crafting supplies, etc, I don't think this will be a problem.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:42:12
That doesn't mean they're going to stoop to illegal practices.  I just refuse to believe that any more than a few will actually pay for a DOS attack on a competing vendor.
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:08:31
You'd be amazed how many people are completely fed up with the established online marketplaces for a variety of reasons.  They're banned, their listings have been limited, their money is frozen for months, they get anywhere from 12-40% of their revenue eaten up by fees, etc.
So sure, OB doesn't seem like that big of a deal on the surface if you're not doing a lot of selling online, but for sellers of goods it can be huge.  It is finally a place where they cannot be banned, limited, or have their money frozen, and it's completely free to use on top of that.  No one can intervene and tell them what they can and cannot do.
Obviously there is a huge barrier to overcome (people have to use Bitcoin), but I think that if OB works as well as it is expected to, eventually it'll become hugely popular.
And I'm talking just about things that are actually legal to sell.  I'm sure the expected market for illicit and illegal goods is huge as well.  It'll be silk road 3.0, but with no central servers to take down this time.

To add to this, you can't really think about the total number of minted coins being a part of the supply/demand cycle.

No one is saying that it'll be 100% fraud proof.  But there's a benefit to accepting 0-conf transactions that outweighs the risk that the person you're interacting with will double-spend it.

No it wouldn't, because people have psychological roadblocks against buying fractions of things for large amounts of money.  I'd argue that if it was programmed for 2.1 million coins, we'd be at a much lower price, something like $2k.  And if it was 210 million coins, we could be well over $100 right now.
I think people too easily gloss over the psychological impact of only being able to buy a fraction of a coin = I've already missed the boat.

Your post is a giant contradiction.  You advocate for keeping small blocks, but then you go on with statements like this:


How? It's reached its limit!


Won't happen with 1MB blocks, there's not enough transaction space for any sort of large amount of value to move.


Are you kidding me?  There's not enough blockspace for transactions to happen through Open Bazaar, much less any others that might come along. 


Right... but who will accept bitcoin when it takes days to confirm?  Who will pay in bitcoin when it takes a $3 fee to send a single average transaction?


You may as well concede that there will be no war if Bitcoin is kept a very niche product.  And that's all Bitcoin will ever be if we stay at 1MB blocks.
You can't make a 40 passenger bus carry 4,000 people.  It is ridiculous to assume you can continue to have significant growth in Bitcoin when we have effectively reached the transaction limit already.

Right, but if this happened on a regular basis, a solution would be found.  Either moving to a different hashing algorithm to render the cartel's hardware worthless or people attempting to break up the cartel.  It would't be cheap for the cartel to perform this for a long period of time either - millions of dollars a week at current price/difficulty levels.

I agree with him, FWIW.  Security is a huge bane of Bitcoin, since it is non-reversible.  You can blame it on the user all you want, but until it is much more difficult to steal from users, it won't be winning any popularity contests.

There wasn't a clear advantage to most people of using gold-backed dollars.  They thought the government knew what it was doing, and that it would be beneficial for them to use it.
I mean surely if you believe that a group of people can be influential enough to make people want an inferior product then any number of things could kill Bitcoin, but that doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin itself.  I mean heck, if a cartel had that much influence, they could just as easily convince the general public that an altcoin or a premine is better than Bitcoin and get everyone to move to it instead.

Miners aren't going to mine worthless transactions in the future.  It'll cost people to spam the blockchain.
Also Gavin tested 20MB blocks and found that there were no significant problems poised with them (it wasn't slowing the blockchain to a crawl).  I think the biggest potential issue is internet speed and bandwidth caps, as 20MB every 10 minutes is a decent amount to ask of your average residential connection in the states, but those with fiber and the rest of the world should have full nodes covered pretty nicely still.  And that problem only starts to crop up when we actually have enough transactions to fill 20MB blocks, which could take many years yet.  By then, hopefully internet will be better here in the states as well.

@_date: 2015-02-04 19:42:42
This is definitely true, especially with the vast array of SHA-256 hashing equipment out now.  If 80% of miners stopped mining, that's 400% of the new lower hashrate now on the market for sale to the highest bidder - probably very cheaply too.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:52:50
I love the complete dismissal that small blocks are hurting adoption. Of course it hurts adoption when people can't send/receive Bitcoin reliably. It also hurts investment by companies that might otherwise be interested in funding Bitcoin-related projects.
Just because larger blocks tend towards centralization does not automatically demonize 2mb blocks. More people involved in Bitcoin means a higher price, more buy-in from companies, and ultimately a better image of Bitcoin to the world. Anyone thinking that this doesn't matter is stupid to be frank.

This isn't really as big of a deal as people make it out to be though.  No miner can steal your coins, they can only prevent transactions from being processed.  As long as you keep that in mind (i.e., don't accept zero-conf except for small amounts, etc), there's nothing to worry about.

@_date: 2015-02-04 21:29:53
I'm not talking about steady decline, I'm talking about stagnation.  TDBit mentioned a scenario where Bitcoin essentially stagnates for 20 years.  I'm assuming price stays where it is as well, though obviously that would be a false assumption for one reason or another.  We would have 4 halvings in that time period.  That means miners would be making 1/16th of what they are today.  Given that mining is already nearly unprofitable for most miners, 93% of them would have to stop mining before it becomes profitable again for the few remaining.
Of course, in 20 years, there's bound to be some efficiencies found in mining equipment, so perhaps you could say that 13% or even 20% of miners could stick around with better equipment on hand, but that still leaves a huge amount of hashpower going unused and likely up for purchase on the cheap to whomever has nefarious purposes for it (blackmail, governments wanting to shut bitcoin down, bankers who feel threatened, etc).
I do see your point that it is largely irrelevant, because if bitcoin is still in the same place 20 years from now as it is today, then what's the point of using it anyway, but it would certainly be a final nail in the coffin to have such a threat looming over the remaining users' heads.

The problem is, consumers still have to trust someone, even if it is open source.  Consumers don't have the technological know-how to check whether the open source code is good, or whether it matches the firmware on their drive.
And if they have to trust someone, then it's not much difference from the current situation.  Sure, you could say that there's multiple people looking over the code, but any outcries from those people could be hidden from google just as easily as your average whistleblower.
I don't think we'll see any push towards open source hardware due to these recent revelations myself.

And then those who want Bitcoin to be uncoerced will change the hashing algorithm with a hard fork to continue on unabated, while the baddies now have a whole bunch of useless hardware and a network no one wants to use.  Yes, it would be a painful thing to happen, but it's certainly not the end of Bitcoin as we know it if such a mining cartel did come to power.

We shouldn't be actively promoting Bitcoin right now, there's no more room for growth.  Until we either have LN or bigger blocks, it's a bad idea.

@_date: 2016-07-05 15:38:58


Well not really.  Because the difficulty stays the same until the difficulty changes, it's not like they'd be mining blocks any faster on the other chain regardless of how many others are mining along with them.
The reason they had incentive to change is because they quickly figured out that the long chain was going to be dropped, so any new blocks mined there would be worthless.  So it was less about gaining extra bitcoins and more about not losing bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:18:20
That's not true at all.  If you flip a coin 10 times, it doesn't make the 11th more likely to be heads.  Your work isn't cumulative when it comes to Bitcoin mining.
The ONLY thing that makes it SLIGHTLY more profitable is the lower likelihood of blocks being orphaned.

Still not true.  It doesn't matter how many miners there are until the difficulty changes - until then, you have exactly the same chance to find a low hash with or without other miners on the network.
