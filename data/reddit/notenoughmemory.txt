You for real? Russia is a mother fukn POWER HOUSE!
We've all seen Russia's might with Putin at the helm.
May I remind you:
Chechnya for Kosova conflict with Serbia. Negotiated
Russia openly sending Iran nuclear machinary
Selling arms to anyone who's willing to pay dollars for it
Turning off the tap to neighbouring countries who don't pay for the warm winters they receive.
Gateway to energy
Recent conflict Putin whipped Obamas ass spent hours with reporters answering any questions they had to ask...
The Russians should consider Bitcoin as a viable and forthcoming option toward the ever changing future.
