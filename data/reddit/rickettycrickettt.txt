The whole crypto market cap has been fluctuating by 100-200 billion in the past few weeks.  Most coins have been affected similarly.  
 It's really strange to watch that much money ebb and flow on a consistent basis.

Also, the same question of "when is the market going to drop so I can finally buy?" is posted several times daily.   
People really need to start doing some research, or at least use a search bar before posting.  Hopefully before investing,  too.

I generally ignore the rhetoric and htperbole.  I took issue there because it was apparent this guy was new to btc and no one was telling him he was in the wrong spot.  
 It's akin walking into a place named Ray's Famous Pizza and asking "is this really the original Ray's?" And getting the response of " Oh yes,  this is Ray's FAMOUS pizza! Very good price, have a seat."  
Bit of a New York centric analogy,  but there it is.   Here's another:  BCH appears on all fronts to be the fake Canal St. Rolex of Crypto.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:07
You don't have to have any crypto on the exchange in order to witness what looks a hell of a lot like insider trading and/or collusion between BCH and Coinbase.
Coinbase themselves are "investigating" the possibility of insider trading within their own company because of it.
Also, before you start calling people retards and then telling them how you left your btc on an exchange in order to claim forked coins, take a look into something called a hardware wallet.

The price is locked in when you buy on coinbase. It may take a week or more to clear,  but it will have been purchased at the price it was at when you made the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:12:19
when will Trump supporters realize that at election time, we were faced with a choice between a racist, weathered leather recliner, and a human being who sucked,  but still wasn't blatantly taking a piss on the American flag while putting a middle finger up to the rest of the world?

You're voicing the same concerns as a lot of people,  and they're not unfounded.   You do however seem uneducated when it comes to the underlying technologies,  which are what a large percentage of those of us that are investing believe in.

Try a comment that doesn't include "cnn" or "fake news".  It gives people a reason to believe you can think for yourself and form an opinion on your own.

agh, I see.  At least you're not a bot.  You're just a fucking idiot. 
Calling someone a racist is different from stating an opinion on immigration policies.   This ability to differentiate is key to the skillset required to have a marginally coherent conversation.

As a newcomer and resident of NYC, I was disappointed to find that I don't even have the option of Poloniex or Kraken due to state regulations, so,  Coinbase/GDAX it is.  Still,  I'd like a bit more variety in my options than just BTC, ETH and LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:26:29
Correct me if I'm wrong,  but you'd have to wait a week for your bank transfer to go through with GDAX before you could lock in any price, right?  Coinbase allows you to lock in the price at the moment and makes your BTC available about a week later.

My understanding is that it's only defined as a full node if you download the entire blockchain (not pruned), and accept incoming connections on port 8333.

Yeah, it was a pain in the ass,  but I'm glad it finally worked out- though I worry if I shut it down it will wipe the data directory,  since that inexplicably happened once before. 
I finally had success starting fresh on an external drive with both bitcoin core and the data directory. 
Good luck!

Fair enough- just be aware there's a solid amount of near-McCarthyism aimed at those with limited history here and negative opinions on various cryptos.  
There's a cottage industry made of paid shills and FUDsters designed to try and sway the market in one direction or the other in the early stages of this industry. 
I'm not accusing in any form,  just saying that the circumstances around your post and account age are in line with something we've seen a lot of.

You're not denying that climate change exists,  but claim global warming isn't a "REAL problem"?  
And you say we need to stop polluting.
How are we shaping policy based on the "fear- mongering that is central to global warming alarmism" that wouldn't also be in line with the idea of reducing pollution? 
I'd argue that with this current administration,  we're in need of as many "global warming alarmists" as possible.

I've just managed to get a full node running and accepting incoming connections on my home network.  
 I'm happy to be participating within the network and helping to further decentralize, but it seems I can't come to a conclusion of whether or not my participation is actually of any actual value to the network or not. 
I have no idea what references to Amazon or Alibaba mean within this context; I am but a mere follower of step by step walkthroughs,  and I have yet to incur the great costs apparently associated with running a node. 
Can someone clue me in here? I'm not using a node for a wallet,  so I'm not transacting.   Is there any point to what I'm doing?  
I'd like to believe that participating in the network is kind of the entire point of Bitcoin,  but I can't make heads or tails. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:14:58
