No, but politic has a bitcoin problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:42:04
no problem if you put this shitcoin into something cool like iota, dash etc.. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:21:04
bitcoin futures are a load of shit.. it’s fiat and has nothing to do with bitcoin except the name. its for people who want to make fast (fiat) money not seeing the big thing bitcoin will change the world to a be a better one. better for all the people, bad for financial terrorists. have a great weekend guys!

The guy who pumps a new coin on Twitter every single day? Very serious!
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:11:54
Man, how can Bitcoin go mainstream if nobody knows and buys it? What should people do? Pray to Satoshi? Learning whitepaper by heart? This is ideological dreaming, welcome to reality! Whats happening now is the very important step before widespread adoption (if technical issues will be solved). Thats it!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:21:46
Always important for experts calling themselves experts. Otherwise I would not have noticed. :)

Big money, actually waiting on the sideline, will only be put in crypro over an ETF or a regular (stock) exchange. Wall street will not use Bitfinex, Binance.... thats for sure.

bitcoin will be dead tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:13:39
i see irony is not bitcoin communitys language. too much emotions.. :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:20:04
scam artist...
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:29:07
It‘s not adoption time yet... it‘s speculation and development time. Both are very important steps before adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:39:59
..this will come to a bad ending i predict.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:51:17
more speculators are not more adoption. simple as that. bitcoin / crypto has to deliver now!
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:50:10
boy, you gambled and you had luck. it‘s ok and i don‘t have any resentment with your gains but please.. don‘t sell luck as wisdom. no one here needs these sly sayings.. you and also no other person knew or actually knows how the market is doing next in short term. so be happy with your gains and do what you think it‘s right for you.
