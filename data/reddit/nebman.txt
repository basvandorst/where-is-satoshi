Op, if you deploy them in the same /24 subnet, it will not help the network much, because Satoshi clients will not connect to the same subnet twice.

that was the well known reddit-hug-of-death ;)  
I'd recommend you to use some sort of microcaching for static sites, to spare the backend some work
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:56:37
I run full nodes on 512MB and 1024MB RAM machines, so... NOPE.
1024MB is enough. 512MB will need a little help during initial sync, but it works fine after.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:05:07
I agree - it's easy to implement and provides better security

the livestream is provided by bitcoinist.net  
they promised to upload Richard Stallman's talk afterwards, so there is hope for the other talks too ;)
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:35:49
the stream is now (temporarily) offline, because he requested to not stream with non-free software...
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:22:28
This would be easy to code, is there a broader audience to use that formatted data?
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:32:39
he specifically requested to only have his talk recorded and distributed in free formats (i.e. ogg) and not on ustream, youtube, etc..

you have to pay the kiosk, the POS provider and of course coinfinity for providing their service. then add 20% Austrian sales tax. 8% total premium is surprisingly low.

using linux you can use this command to verify the checksum

`server=1` is not needed with bitcoind, only bitcoin-qt.
if you put `daemon=1` in your `bitcoin.conf` file, you don't need to run `bitcoind -daemon` just plain `bitcoind`
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:57:10
what wallet are we talking about? if you have a wallet.dat from early days of bitcoin-qt there is a good chance that it is not encrypted and holding your private keys. 
what pieces are you missing?
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:38:47
I can write a tutorial on setting up Debian 7 and compiling bitcoind from source.
You can get some pretty cheap offers from  but be careful, initially downloading and verifying the blockchain causes a huge amount of CPU usage which will often be considered CPU abuse and this will result in a suspended servers.
For choosing a server I would recommend a large included traffic of atleast 2 terabytes per month, and atleast 20GB disk as the blockchain at this point will not fit with only 15GB.
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:08:47






@_date: 2013-11-04 13:58:21
everyone uses the same blocks and they all come with timestamps, so you would just need to go back -2016 blocks in the current chain to calculate the timespan

OT: how much traffic does bitcoind generate for you per month? I am thinking of running it on my virtual servers to contribute to the network but do not have unlimited traffic
@_date: 2013-05-19 00:59:03
Do you supply the whole transaction output chain history to the card? I mean if the keys stay on the card, the card has to know which output to sign. If someone would fake the amount of the supplied transaction output to be signed, he could get away with the rest of your balance as transaction fee.

Really? Never noticed that! Props to Gmail for being innovative like always
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:11:00
they can track it, but they wont know who owns the addresses you are sending to. that's why it is good practice to generate a new address for every incoming payment. also most of the wallets will send the change of your transaction outputs to a new address, so they couldnt even distinguish which output was the payment or the change
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:00:07


wrong. faking the mail address is very very easy and there are several ways that not even an expert could tell you it is legit unless it has been signed with PGP or S/MIME
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:27:19
wouldn't that be a bit too expensive? haven't done the maths with EC2 recently but from what I remember it wasn't that cheap
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:43:51
better use "screen" or "bitcoind -daemon" or "daemon=1" in bitcoin.conf instead of nohup

OT but kinda awesome to watch you live updating the spreadsheet

did you check the balance of your address on e.g. blockchain.info? and yes this is the public address, you will need the matching private key to use it, found in some wallet
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:34:07
you dont need to buy something, as you can generate millions of new addresses yourself for free. 
generate a new address, send you bitcoins to this new address and nobody can tell for sure who is in possession of the coins now.

@_date: 2013-05-20 08:58:36
If I wanted to store my private key in the blockchain, I would take some random 2 or 3 SHA256 hashes already present anywhere in the blocks or transactions and XOR them to get a new secret key. 
To reconstruct it I would only need to look it up on blockexplorer or blockchain.info and could put it together  even with the windows calculator on any computer worldwide.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:01:31
it actually does warn you when you encrypt your wallet and it asks you for your wallet password when you generate a new address, as addresses are added on the fly, not in bunch of hundreds

I cant even back it up cause I switched to linux. 
But be careful with that iTunes backup password, there was once a bug I suffered, it switched on encrypted backups itself and took randomly one of the passwords I entered somewhere else on the windows system.
I know that sounds really weird and made up, but I stumbled upon the solution somewhere on the support forums and couldnt believe it myself. Hard facepalm on that Apple stuff.

Mining solo will only help if you find a block - and with block erupters they are near zero.
I will include the steps to compile it on Wheezy when I finish my tutorial. No need for unstable packages.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:46:25
You have some interesting points. To date I know no service/website which would represent some sort of network health in a good overview. 
I have some dedicated nodes running. Maybe I can use them to sample a few hundred peers for stats.
To get or estimate the number of nodes, there is already  which scan for 8-9 hours every day to collect their data, so it's no value to get very quick.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:13:46

@_date: 2013-06-07 09:15:50
Taken from  the biggest entity has atm 23% of the network's total hashrate. Given Table 1 in  6 confirmations would be around 4% possibility. So with 23% of the network you could at any given time attempt an attack with 4% chances of reversing transactions. Doesnt really sound good if you ask me. To get that possibility down &lt;1% it would need somewhere around 10 confirmations, or even more. Thats where my previous reply of 15 confirmations come from, tbh I dont know where I got this from, but someone in this subreddit once did the math and it checked out. Also in the past some pools were a bit larger.
Also a quote from the source above:






We are way over that 10% scenario.

@_date: 2013-12-29 21:00:41
I think you meant this one 
@_date: 2013-11-04 13:53:03
this is just plain wrong. it has nothing to do with transaction fees, its just a maths game mining on private branches of the blockchain and to be able to release them to the public when another block would be found you need many nodes (sybil attack). 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:06:38
8332 is RPC, 8333 is what you want to be open
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:01:56
Your points are very valid. But I think the problem is that 
1) rules are not enforced, because systems like DKIM and SPF are kinda experimental and therefor not enforced by many mail providers (because that would unfortunately break things like all mailing lists and other stuff) and 
2) non-experienced users would not know how to check, and I guess even thought experts DO know, they rarely or never do it (manually)
I'd conclude that it is possible under certain circumstances, but not very practical or even user-friendly
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:05:23
Responsiveness is no matter of linux distribution, it's rather the configuration and components used, which can and will vary with every user.

I'd suggest you put the link to the PGP key file into your DNS. Lookup "PKA".
This way your key can get downloaded automatically without manual import by GPG.

This pull request is for watch-only addresses in bitcoind: 
To checkout the code from this git branch do the following:
    git clone 
    git remote add laanwj 
    git fetch laanwj
    git checkout laanwj/2013_12_importaddress_rebase
    ./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make
    
Now you have a custom bitcoind binary with watch-only functionality. Use `bitcoind importaddress` to add.

it eats up memory over time, especially during initial sync. if you restart the process often enough you can get away with 512mb of ram usage, but i would definitely recommend at least 1GB

Yes, that's the beauty of bitcoin ;)
But be careful, under certain circumstances your wallet could combine inputs of your old and new address in one transaction, which would reveal the ownership information. This will happen when you leave some coins or even fragments on your old address and you use a wallet that will not let you choose your sending address (like the official bitcoin-qt client).
Edit: Stores dont have well known public addresses, and your delivery address isnt saved in the blockchain, so there is no way somebody could establish such a relation in the blockchain.
