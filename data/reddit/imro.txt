If you eat this shit up you are even more delusional bunch than I ever imagined.

Sorry, my bad, I lost track of usernames.

How about comparing it to pay pal. Not that you are wrong about WU, but it is a bit cherry picking.

A disclaimer: I do not advocate regulations for bitcoin. I don't really have an opinion on that. I don't even know how it would be possible. I was just trying to point out that deregulated system isn't without flaws.


It was also led by a man, had offices in Japan and was connected to internet. We should avoid all of those things. Unless you can show that the regulation was responsible for its demise your statement is empty.


I doubt that. Will studying the bitcoin history be a requirement to enter? May be I am misunderstanding what bitcoin is trying to be. Is it an universal tender or exotic investment?

I love how easily people get delusional about their pets, while everybody else is just bunkers.

Your ideals are clouding your judgement. I bet you get your knickers in a not every time you hear about "big government" surveillance, yet somehow it is OK for you to advertise all your purchases for anybody to look at. And not only that but for them to be there until the dawn of time, or at least while bitcoin lasts. I can imagine the amount and frequency of you spending money in marijuana dispensaries could be used against you in for example a custody battle, or hiring process or what ever.

I think you misunderstood me. I am not cementing on marijuana legalization or state vs federal laws. I am commenting on bitcoin privacy or lack thereof.
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:43:35
Nothing better than the whole world knowing that you broke federal law.

If I am not mistaken, bank's health is gauged based on several different things. One of them is new deposits accounts vs new loans. Bank can get in trouble if they are opening too many or too few deposit accounts when compared to the amount of loans they are opening. So I am guessing that Wells Fargo was trying to maintain certain ratio to keep examiners away.

Not sure if you are being sarcastic or just fucking idiot. Poe's law at its finest.

I am not arguing for heavy market intervention. Just that some is necessary.




You are correct I got the HDI mixed up with life satisfaction. Based on your previous argument you were concerned about economic efficiency which in your view is best with free market and I am not denying it. But that is only the wealth. Free market does not provide health or access to basic education. That is what my nonsensical paragraph was about. 


And that is good in what way?
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:30:30


with free market you don't get either. But OK. I guess I went on a tangent ...


Yes, but those are not accessible to everybody hence your life satisfaction goes down. Look at HDI when adjusted for inequality.


oh yeah it is. Urges people to sit on their money, investments don't meet demand, real value of dept increases - all contributes to even worse economy. Although it might be beneficial for some it hurts most of the people.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:22:35
Oh sure, but that is not how it works 99% of time. You are acting like every other scenario is 100% bullet proof and this is the worst one possible. Do you have a better way of keeping money?

One thing I felt was left out, while speaking of no trust needed, is that there is no reversals and no consumer/payer protection. You send it - it is gone. So yeay for merchants, not so much for consumers.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:12:17
I am not denying the less-efficiency, favoritism or insecurities introduced by government intervention. Neither the fact that some of most of it could be solved by completely free market. But completely free market is an unachievable ideal and it does not come without a price or its own problems.
I did not say that greed was a reason for intervention. Greed is a source of problems in any model and therefore you should not discount it from free market model.
The link you provided for HDI states that "subjective well being correlates most strongly with health, wealth, and access to basic education". With your stance you seem to be focusing only on wealth.   


As you most likely know every economy has a cycle. Expansion, boom, recession and depression. The government intervention is there to smooth this out as much as possible. The economic inefficiency in the expansion - boom period is a trade off that helps people get through the recession - depression period. That is the single most important reason why it is worth a while.
There is nothing intrinsic to free market that deals with recession and depression.

Then tell me about a non-idealistic alternative that is known to work better. Please provide real world examples, including shortcomings and pitfalls. Because unless you can cure human greed, there isn't a model without them. Then we can weigh in smaller efficiency and favoritism against it.
I am not being facetious.

I am here not because I see bitcoin as the be all and end all of economic problems. It is just interesting to me.
Full reserve banking has its own problems - for example it stifles economic growth. It would seem that islamic banking does not make a good case for it either.

I stopped watching after they said that your bank "steals" 90% of your money. This video reeks with propaganda.
I understand your problem with market intervention, but that is a trade off for what ideally should be a more stable economy.
