Israelis are just people who live in Israel, just people living their lives.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that.

Glad I could help you out!
In the off chance you are being sarcastic: Go fuck yourself :)

You have to spend to be rich? I disagree, rich is purely money in the bank.

Honestly who cares if you are getting tired of it?  
Let people have their own thoughts, try to add something to the conversation, don't take away from it.

I don't perceive them to have value, so what would they cost me?

Real value = perceived value.  What someone is willing to pay is how much something is transferable for.

Nice work on starting this discussion and bringing so much to the table!

I don't believe that statement is true at all.

Similar to a pay check that must be converted to cash to make purchases.  Both btc and checks are clear examples of a value storage device, except btc is better.

Politely accept you are wrong, no need for name calling.

That was a quick rebound, there is major underpinning on this rally!  Wow...

I've pinged a friend who works there asking what their plans are for btc.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:40:46
Ah yes error&lt;234&gt;, well played!

While I do agree with you completely, to the new people looking in they want at least one BTC but they don't want to pay $400+.  I've been a promoter to my circles about bitcoin and this is one of the biggest psychological blockades I have encountered.
