I am Czech too and I think the oposite. Czech republic is very liberal and Czech nature is that we don't like autorities so I would say it is more open to Bitcoin than anything.
The media campain is heating up (i don't know if it will be pro bitcoin or not) so please all pro Bitcoin enthusiasts living in Czech rep, we have to be better organized. Join Facebook groups Bitcoin Brno (mine) or Česká Bitcoinová komunita

"Gox price going up, rats are abounding sinking ship."
That was on Reddit several times and it made me think about Bitcoin community.

SELL SELL SELL, ... never ending stories of Bitcoin beeing overvalued.
I remember when I bought around 120, but it was steadily going down to 70, than 60. At some point I sold it and after a week a new rally began ending at 1200.

I just think there should be a way how to prevent to transact bitcoins wherever they want. If you are nearly bancrupt (under protection) you should have frozen accounts

I lost "only" 37 BTC but no need to listen sorrow from other people. Life is beautiful even totally naked, it is an experience your soul is having and loosing money is maybe your goal in life, because you need to learn from bad experiences to become wise

I don't tell this lightly (myself having some 30 BTCs at gox) but this journalist could be easily a victim of a troll. I think whole gox.com (look at their facebook btw) could be a big trolling

Than everyone else dumps it and his bitcoins have no value. When one man owns whole currency is the current state with Federal reserve. Bitcoin is democratic currency

Exactly, Bitcoin Foundation has to step in, whole Bitcoin community will be Goxed if they will continue with comments like: Rats are leaving sinking boat etc. We have to unite or Bitcoin will die
