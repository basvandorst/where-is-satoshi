It's decentralised so there's no third party, unless you count the network itself. But nobody controls that.

Not sure we have a better system. The big thing about Bitcoin is that you can transfer value electronically without involving a third party. There's downsides to that of course but it's fairly revolutionary too.

That's a really good explanation. Can you develop the point on why the incentive to hoard is a bad thing? Surely, while the incentive to hoard is there, people will still spend on goods and services that they feel they need (but I can see how things could become very medieval very quickly!). Isn't the flip side of that point that the current economy largely depends on us spending on things we don't really need, which can't be a good thing either.

The way he somewhat defensively says "I don't want to sound like a socialist but .. " leads me to believe that Satoshi is from the US. The word doesn't have the same negative connotations in other English speaking countries and it's hard to imagine somebody from the UK, for example, feeling a need to preface his point with that line.

Brits wouldn't be as defensive about the term 'socialist'. It's just not a bad word in the UK.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. This is the kind of debate that is necessary. 
Can you expand on the following?

Could it possible be to do with the surge in bitcoin activity in their next door neighbour, Venezuala, in recent weeks?

There is so much bullshit in that article, I gave up half way through.

Plenty of folks don't have credit or debit cards so they can't use AirBNB.

Plenty of people in the developing world have smart phones but not bank accounts.

Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. 
It does seem that it could be a truly disruptive technology alright.
