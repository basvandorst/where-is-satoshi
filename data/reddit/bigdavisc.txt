I tried that. It stills gives too big a range...
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:53:26
What about the numbers under the public address in the image? Any relevance...

Hmmm. I saw it as: 32 squares translating to 64 characters (HEX Private Key) &amp; 16 sections of each square (One for each character in 0-9 A-F).
If you want to collaborate let me know.

*facepalm* of course...

What is the TXID?
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:45:28
Send me a DM with the TXIDs I'll see what I can do
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:18:13
Ya sorry. The accelerator is great when ViaBTC gets on a roll with mining blocks. They have been lacking for the last couple hours. It should get included soon...
UPDATE: As of 467226, your transactions have been confirmed :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:01:25
Hey, I pushed your TX through an accelerator, so it should be included in a ViaBTC block soon (maybe a few hours...)
See proof here: 
I'd hate to take 1/3 of your transaction, but if you feel like sending something my way, my address is 1FUevLyYqVAd7EjCiXTr7dFoxdco1DKtaN
EDIT: It was confirmed as of block 467961
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:10:10
One way you can find it is by looking up the sending address on a block explorer like blockchain.info... What was the address that send the transaction? (you can probably find this by going into the transaction history of QT)

The one unconfirmed is a TX that spends the bitcoins, Ill assume that that is the one you want confirmed. Ill take a look when I get back to my computer in about an hour.
EDIT: Just so you know, for future reference the fee that you included only ended up being about 161 Satoshis/Byte and that is about half of what the recommended fee is currently. I'd recommend checking out  to track how much you should pay in fees in the future.

No prob. I am jus glad I was able to help.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:24:37
You got to get it at the right time. Because they only accept 100 TX's an hour, it makes it difficult to get in there.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:05:18
I added your TXID to the ViaBTC Accelerator so it will be confirmed the next time VIaBTC mines a block (probably later today). See  for proof.
I don't use PayPal, but if you are still willing the $10 can go to 1DUKrHaf5v11uwG7krN8xgwYX6WqB69Crh
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:12:20
No problem, I'm happy to help :-)
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:30:05
What is the TXID?
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:05:44
Yup. All good. Have a great weekend
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:21:28


Have you tried it? Becuase I have and guess what...
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:28:20
Maybe just paste any blockchain.info link you have?
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:01:45
I threw both of those transactions into ViaBTC's Accelerator, so they will be confirmed the next time that ViaBTC mines a block. Thanks for supporting SegWit, every person helps...

What are you talking about? Blockchain DOES allows you to export your private keys. Because they are focused on creating a user-friendly wallet, exporting private keys is not something that is generally needed for most users, however, you can do it. 
Blockchain accounts use BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 HD Wallets and your 12-word recovery phrase can be used to get all the private keys used for receiving and for change addresses. Websites such as [this]( can take those 12 words and allow you to view all your private keys (Although I do not recommend you do that on the live website, download the file and verify it first). 
In conclusion, please do your research before making accusations.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:04:22
Ya. The reason it didn't go through was that you had a really low fee attached to the transaction. Almost a quarter of what it needed to be. You can try VIABTC's accelerator to get it included in a block...
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:36:18
Most likely is just fees have gone up a lot in the last few weeks...
