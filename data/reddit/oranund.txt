To be precise, I'm saying that fake volume exploded after the November price fall, compared to prior.
Look at any legitimate exchange (Coinbase, Gemini, etc.), and their *bitcoin* volume is not back to April 2018 levels, musch less their *USD* volume.
But look at CoinMarketCap's top 50 exchanges by volume; that landscape has changed a lot since last summer. Look at their charts, and you get this kind of volume graph:[
So even though there has always been a lot of fake volume, there *really* is *much more*. If there was 90%, there's 96-98% now.
If you're an active trader, you know very well, from your current practical experience on exchanges, that volumes are still very low compared to Spring 2018.

Yeah if we keep on like this, Reddit might civilly ask us to move the conversation elsewhere!
I might have been unclear when I mentioned legitimate exchanges: I do believe that most of them have all-real volume. Although as you know, some "big" exchanges are not as big as they claim, as well-argued in the article we both read. Rather, I blame exchanges new to the top 60 for faking their volume in an extremely shameless way. No gradual ramp-up, no pretense of legitimacy, just bam! volumes 30 times higher overnight. That's who I blame the increasingly fake volume on.
I am surprised to see LocalBitcoins volume so stable post-drop. I could speculate that it's due to the Venezuela situation, but I'm not fully read-up on that. But as their volume is $7M daily to CoinMarketCap's $9000M, I would look elsewhere too. Anyway, the major exchanges, if they fake anything, certainly don't fake more than before, with their USD-equivalent volumes 2-3 times lower than last April.
As the situation stands, before the end of the year, we will blow past the turn-of-2018 volume records independently of bitcoin price, which is sure to command attention...

Of course, but never at this scale, not remotely.

Quadriga actually *lost* the case vs CIBC, but spun it in a positive light.

Why say QuadrigaCX won the case with CIBC?
QCX **lost**. This is public information.
(Not that losing was a big deal in this case, as *at least* things moved forward.)

Saying that Quadriga won a $22M lawsuit against CIBC is misleading.
That the case finally ended was positive for QCX, yes. There was no scenario where they would not have got their funds back; they only needed things to advance.
QCX did not "win" that case in any sense of the word. They were dragged to court against their wishes, were unable to make their case, and were forced by the court to prove ownership of the funds.
