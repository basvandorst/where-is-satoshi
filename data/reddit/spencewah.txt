Bitcoin are easy to obtain.  They're hard to obtain without linking your identity to the purchase, but that's a cost you're choosing to incur.

Was able to set up a coinbase account and buy some bitcoins in less than an hour.  Haven't yet funded my mt.gox account because the options available to do so are so fucking miserable.

Not sure where this million dollar watermark comes from, are you talking about the ability of bitcoins to be subdivided?

I don't understand why everyone in this thread is so outraged.  They burn the coins to avoid a conflict of interest.  This is objective journalism 101.

There's no requirement for greed to be at someone else's expense.  Your friends and family think they're seeing a way to get extraordinarily wealthy with a minimum of effort, which is encouraging their adoption of the currency.  Wonder who gave them that idea?

Litecoin seems to be designed solely to appease those people who are sour about missing the early bitcoin mining rush.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:52:04
Why wasn't .8 just allowed to be the longest chain?  Isn't this how the protocol is designed?  It clearly had more hashing power behind it, which I thought was the deciding factor in forks (go with whichever chain ends up longer)

But it helps to imagine this scenario without tying the value of the bitcoin to another currency.  You're translating bitcoin to USD in your head before going forward, which is a bad habit.  
If you can imagine a **shirt** costing $30, then you can also imagine a shirt costing 1BTC.  Now, as bitcoins get used more and more, demand for them increases, and that 1BTC will buy you something a little more valuable, say, a **pair of shoes**.  Time goes on, that 1BTC can now get you a **nice watch**.  Years go by, that 1BTC can now be traded for a new **leather sofa**.  Then a **car**.  Then a **yacht**.  And the problem is not that "well we can just cut it into tiny little bits and use those bits to pay for the shirt!", it's that the currency is _always gaining buying power_.
@_date: 2013-03-01 08:13:12
You can think of it as the opposite behavior of an economy with runaway inflation.  When currency is inflating rapidly, consumers _need_ to spend it as soon as they get it because it's rapidly losing buying power.  Have a listen to this [This American Life episode]( it cover's Brazil's runaway inflation pretty well.

From a very practical standpoint, being the first led bitcoin to having the longest and fastest growing blockchain, making it the most secure.  Any fork will have this issue.  Until a new crypto currency is described that doesn't rely on a public ledger system, bitcoin will remain an undisputed king of the heap.

Coinbase charges a 1% fee on buying coins and selling coins, but (obviously) sending coins within the bitcoin network is free (free-ish, minus whatever you pay in transaction fees)
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:00:47
The reason they burn the coins is to avoid a conflict of interest.  BFL is essentially handing them a money making machine, so, in order to fairly review it, they have to ensure that they do not receive the money.
@_date: 2013-03-01 08:06:12
Right, that argument comes a comment from the original deflationary post on Tav's blog.  I'm sure you've read the response to it: having a gradually-weakening computer for a year is better than not having one.  Utility.  See above.

It doesn't really seem that easy, I think paypal/venmo/square are _much_ easier systems and my parents are still wary of them.  "Cash, but online" seems to be the only way I've been able to explain it with any success.
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:26:00
This guy misses the point.


This is the problem.  Right here.  If it's easier to make a purchase tomorrow, then you wait until tomorrow.  Obviously there's some utility to be gained from whatever you're receiving from the trade (you can't eat a bitcoin, e.g.) but any purchase that isn't immediately required seems like it would instead be deferred until you have more buying power.  And when do you have more buying power?

Oh, sorry, I was just using those goods as an illustration of an increase in value, not for their specific purposes.  Shoes cost more than shirts, usually.  The example still holds if you just say "one shirt", "three shirts", "ten shirts", "a hundred shirts", but I wanted to build up to your yacht.

This is idiotic and you're just trying to drum up support for litecoin.
