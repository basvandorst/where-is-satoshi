Right, I guess you cant rush a non tax funded rail system.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:31:49
Alright, thank you so much. This all makes sense now!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:16:48
Oh ok, Thanks! I was concerned for a moment.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:58:54
To make as much money as possible wouldnt you solo mine before releasing it so when it starts hitting new prices youd be making money?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:27:11
Oh ok, thank you for correcting me. Now I know!
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:10:46
That makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:05:08
Right, I was thinking people would probably move onto a different coin. I guess nobody plans on it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:35:56
Well thats money hungry and dirty. Thankfor explaining
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:47:09
Yes, as cpu mining is very profitable.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:11:09
I'm loving these examples. So its an update that simply speeds up transactions so fees are lowered?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:17:56
So say BitcoinCash is because bitcoin was getting so hard to mine people made a new bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:51:54
Im aware of forking, however I didn't know the purpose of forking when it came to crypto. Btw Ghostian is now going to be hitting mid summer 2018 confirmed. Thank you for taking the time to explain it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:15:47
I understand the concept of forking, but why do we bitcoin cash? It seems that it just makes people miserable. I know that alt coins aren't just forks. So when we get to 2040 and bitcoins lifespan is nearing a close will a fork prevent the name from being lost?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:08:25
Thats fair, morbid. Yet fair.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:26:25
How would simply increasing block size be a solution, its like starting a country and printing a 100 bills every year, therefor making your currency valuable. But then you have a civil war, split the country and start printing 1000 bills a year. Obviously you'd lose money. It wouldn't work in of itself to only print 100 bills to try and spread that out across thousands if not millions of people. Which doesnt that mean a crypto like bitcoin would be perfect? Divisible by 100 million would work perfectly. Wouldn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:03:06
I see, thank you alot for the explanation. It all mKes alot mor sense now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:50:19
Interesting, thank you so much for the knowledge. Im actually starting to work on my own blockchain based off of python, I was hoping I could get some extra know how and I did, I understand the economics alot better.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:33:34
Ah, I see. So Bcash was a close minded non inivative solution to a problem?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:08:54
Aah, my bad, didnt realise it was that far away.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:16:30
Eh, that would be more like a string, not a chain. Silly
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:07:29
Right, that makes sense. So what is the deal with lightning? Ive been hearin a bunch of stuff about it but dont have that insight.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:21:27
I get it, its a privately funded transport system tht is affordable and very usuable in practice.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:46:46
A classic.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:10:06
May I ask how much time and energy you've put into this? I've slowly been developing my own blockchain and its been slow however you've inspired me to not give up. From a teen to another, I'm very impressed.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:14:01
Well crap... Im sorry this is all still fairly foreign. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:27:55
Right, thats makes alot of sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:12:45
Acyially? Why would anyone take you seriously?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:08:11
So basicly Store 1 sells bread, One person buys most of the available bread and the store only gets more when it is able to be bought. When somebody buys most of the bread, bread is more scarce and therefore can rise in price, when the "Farmers" sell bread to the store the price drops as theres now more bread for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:21:45
As if I could make any profit from mining
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:20:16
That makes sense, its basicly finding the shortest distance to travel.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:16:57
Lmao, Ill put 100 in soon and come back in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:43:16
Well if there can only be 10 mined a day then simply divide 4,281,275 by 10. I imagine it would have a maximum price once all is out. Or drops as someone moves to a different Coin. So getting back to the first question you would have 428127.5 days or 1,172 years. So I personally believe Bitcoin will outlive  the humans.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:10:31
There probably is, let me see.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:06:24
 You're awesome man! Congratulations.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:18:07
Thanks for the advice! Im definitley going to apply that to my whole life now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:02:03
Ahhh, so I use a medium to purchase, send repeat? Nice thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:32
Hmm strange, I seem to recall it only being 10 bitcoin a day. However I will not argue. I did look it up and you are correct. However I also didnt intend to give an accurate answer. I simply offered an equation. Thank you for informing me though!
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:15:45
Partially, of course I actually do regret buying at 5k however its not like buying right now would be idiotic.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:10:53
HAAHAHHAHAHAH, Youre very funny.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:15
Then I would be 6 years old and spent 100 on something that I couldnt understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:19:37
Remindme! 22 years
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:20:07
Haha, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:18:23
Yes siree!
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:50:04
Thanks! Can you explain your thesis now?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:51:10
Lmao, made me giggle. .73 seems like a good price though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:07:44
Sooo, wheres that guy thats gonna eat his testicle?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:51:28
I wanna see that left testical being eaten.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:20:26
Never got my fucking sofa....
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:00:42
Excuse my question, Shuttle is the equivalent to plane. Correct?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:41:48
I think thats against the idea of trading.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:58:53
I will be doing Lots of hodling
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:44:55
Bitcoin overall
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:15:57
Thankyou, I will drink my sofa with pride
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:30:51
Lmao I'm 14. Thanks for the advice though.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:46:13
Hmmm, well I think Im boned.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:21:15
Any good resources to study Markets?
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:56:13
So patience is key, should I invest 500 at say 4.9k if it gets that low and sell at 5.6 to get a 71 dollar increase?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:16:50
I mean, Ill take 500 sofas. Lmao
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:49:50
Sweet, Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:27:47
Im in no rush, its optimistic but I have a good feeling about it if I wait. Patience is key.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:42:55
51.78? So I would literally make no money?
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:30:49
Indeed they are. My bad
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:38:58
Please elaborate
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:35:12
Can you explain?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:17:42
What is nov 18th?
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:38:13
Thank you, I ask because if I didnt purchase a full bitcoin and instead a fraction if I only recieve a fraction. So I could invest 5 dollars and sell at a high point and make more money by investing less?
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:15:51
I appreciate your help greatly. Im most likely going to use it as a savings and put more money in as time moves along.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:23:55
Lol, knowing some people dont know the equation and are literally asking for help is difficult for some people.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:28:30
Okay, Thankyou for the advice. I think its just time to find a part time job as Im a teen.
