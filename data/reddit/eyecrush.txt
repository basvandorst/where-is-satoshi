Sorry, but that was disproven. Gox didn't actually hold enough funds to be able to push the price that high.
I guess you're just going to ignore the Dish and Coinbase merger, then? Going to ignore Paypal talking about integrating Bitcoin too, huh?
The only thing needed to raise the price is a higher market cap. As more interest is gained in Bitcoin, people will buy it, naturally raising the market cap over time.

First off, you're not funding an address. You're funding a wallet.
Second, I was talking about sending coins to and from desktop wallet software on personal computers. The initial link during funding doesn't matter - as it cannot be proven that you still have the coins, and if you backup properly, nobody is finding them.
Have you been reading what I have been typing at all?? Who cares if someone knows you got coins from a site where you can buy Bitcoins, because if you take the right precautions, the tracking ends there.

I don't have any yet, but things that give coins an edge will ultimately give them value 5 years down the line. It fills a niche, so it will continue to grow, although slower than the other coins.
That is unless someone can give a public face to the coin, like the Bitcoin and Dogecoin communities has done.

If you use new addresses, transactions cannot be tracked when sent between personal desktop wallets. They have a record of that taking place with those addresses, but that is it. Without something to tie them to an identifier, they remain anonymous - which is what I am getting at.
Basically, don't trust online retailers.

I keep on seeing people pump millions into cryptocurrency payment sites. Toshiba's cash register that accepts Bitcoin by default is a game-changer as well. There are numerous businesses that will adopt the registers just to update them, and many that will buy them for the Bitcoin processing ability.
Not to mention the mentions about Paypal and Ebay....
I think people underestimate Bitcoin's future. I personally think it'll be huge. As adoption increases, fiat to Bitcoin exchange increases, and that raises the value of Bitcoin automatically.
Not to mention that as Bitcoin is better understood, more and more people will see the value in its decentralized, anonymous model. It's going to be huge.
The only way I see it failing is if there is some crazy law that is passed.

@_date: 2014-05-27 00:27:15
Of course they do. Perceived effectiveness is a thing. Half of what happens in any market is all about the perception of the community.
Many of these are not just percieved effectiveness, though. Retailers aren't going to adopt a coin that takes minutes to confirm. More time for a transaction to clear means less time to process more customers. That means a loss in revenue.
Microcoin has INSTANT transactions. Bitcoin takes a couple of minutes to confirm a transaction. That's just one small part.

Going by the evidence of the growing adoption and Ebay/Palpal beginning to endorse it, in addition to the US government giving the green light as well, I would say the future for Bitcoin is bright.
The marketcap just went up $1 billion in a couple of days. Big things are on the horizon, many indicators are telling us this.
Nothing is for certain, but those who feel it is going to go up believe it for a reason. As adoption goes up, market cap will naturally go up as more fiat is exchanged for Bitcoin.
A millionaire also just bought 100,000 Bitcoins, so that should tell you that those who have gotten rich through other means are beginning to take a hard look at Crypto and what it could mean for their bottom line. In addition, it's another avenue for diversification.

So, creating new addresses for each transaction/website/etc beats this, basically. The rest makes sense.

You need to hold a variety of coins for a couple of years to actually get a good ROI. It's FAR too early to be predicting the future of any coin.

It's very big news, or did you not read the article?
The only thing that isn't set for the ETF is the ticker symbol, at this point. This is huge news.

You can't ban Bitcoin. It's in the same vein as P2P file sharing, such as torrenting.
That's like saying you can ban or shutdown the internet.

Also, disable the system speaker and any microphone on the computer. It was proven that packets can be sent through sound, and the more complex malware/viruses take advantage of that.

I misunderstood what you mean, thought you meant online targeted ads. Carry on. In my defense, you didn't make that clear.

Yes, just ignore what's going around you.

No, it isn't.

There will be competing services. Crypto will change EVERYTHING.

Seeing Bitcoin articles is already big enough, but an ETF would change Bitcoin forever. This is INSANE. Holy crap!
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:42:06
If everyone posted this shit to their Facebooks instead of other bullshit, change could happen quite quickly.
What should we do? We should make this information readily available and easily accessible to everyone.

Do you know of any actual traders? If not, please take your uneducated self elsewhere. It's a recommended strategy in the day trading world and consistently profitable.

Most charities do not get the majority of your money to the cause they claim to support.
Any drug that is patented in the medical industry is not worth supporting. If someone cares more about making money than they do availability, then why would I support that?

I still haven't seen a shred of evidence of someone's Bitcoin transactions being tracked.
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:19:57
I withdraw coins immediately when I buy them and then immediately do multiple backups, no matter where I buy them from.
If they are not on a wallet I control, then I don't have them. I think this attitude needs to be adopted by those who are serious about cryptocurrencies. Hell, it's one of the main attractions of them - you can keep them on your computer without a bank.

Nice, so the Freedom in the World survey was headed by a US company?
"Freedom in the World is a yearly survey and report by Freedom House "
"**Freedom House is a U.S.-based**[2] non-governmental organization (NGO) that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights.[3] Freedom House was founded in October 1941. Wendell Willkie and Eleanor Roosevelt served as its first honorary chairpersons. It describes itself as a "clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world"
Freedom House was created as a propaganda mouthpiece to support the war efforts during WWII. That's all it is.
Yes, clearly not biased at all.
I say that because that's a blatant lie. The US is not free. The US is an Oligarchy, and has been for the past 100 years.
**Princeton Study Declares U.S. government an Oligarchy**
Please, tell me how our constant erosion of rights somehow makes us free.

No way. Not only is Darkcoin better with its anonymity features, it's just far more user friendly than Dark Wallet.
Plus, anything that a lot of people have money in is not going to go away.

Yeah man, WinkDex will also have an ETF. Gonna be big! Bitcoin will finally be available as an investment vehicle for those more familiar with traditional investing, such as those on Wallstreet.

The US censors the internet as well, with many sites being randomly shut down daily. They also abuse the 'copyright claim' system to get stuff taken down as well.
Censorship in the US is just as prevalent, it just goes by different names.


How convenient, all these unnamed survey's will tell us the same thing according to you. Pretty convenient statement with nothing to back it up.

People don't realize that others actually use Fibonacci charts in active day trading, and that it is a very effective strategy.
There is most definitely a pattern.

Considering that NONE of them have come even CLOSE to the front page of you just proved everyone else's point but your own.
You just proved that the ones who believe that are in a MASSIVE minority.
Additionally, half of the posts there *talk about how ridiculous calling it a hoax is.*
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:24:52


Not sure why you're saying this, you do know that the whole 'China banned Bitcoin' thing was FUD, right?
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:41:10
Thing is, there are just as many innovators which will make things to counter what you brought up.
As it always has been, and as it always will be. Plus, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are a threat to the centralized slavery debt instruments known as 'fiat currencies.'
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:22:59
SOPA and PIPA protests were effective because *large companies' with deep pockets headed the charge against these bills.* Since far more of these companies' can make money off controlling the internet for their own purposes, that is why net neutrality is a thing of the past now.
Civil rights protests and Vietnam antiwar protests were from a different time. Mentioning them in the context of today's political and social environment just makes you look ignorant. The internet alone has changed our social structure itself.
If a protest is effective, it is because it benefits someone with deep pockets. Nothing more.

Pre-paid card for them, then.

Yes, this is a possibility. Personally, I think cryptocurrencies as a whole will succeed, but I am unsure about Bitcoin itself too.

What do you mean? It has a blockchain and a downloadable wallet just like any other cryptocurrency, unless I am missing something?
EDIT: You can't actually download a wallet for Ripple, can you? I see... wow, Ripple is garbage and spits in the face of what cryptocurrencies are supposed to be...
That minimum Ripple balance to activate an account? Also, who the hell wants to keep their coins on a website? I see now why you made the comments that you did.

Your personal anecdote means nothing.
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:24:38
I have done plenty of research. You're the one making the claims that I have refuted with sources.
Bitcoin transactions can only be linked to you through an online service where you buy them. That's it.
Sending coins to and from personal wallets on a PC cannot be tracked when you change your addresses for each transaction.
