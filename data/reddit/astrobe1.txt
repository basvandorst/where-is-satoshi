rabbit caught in headlights spring to mind - so many funny statements in there I was just shaking my head.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:13
What if you spam the mempool with invalid tx?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:19:50
if he brags about it on campus he'll be lucky to see his computer again but yeah seriously if true advertising it on youtube probably ain't the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:41:30
leaves wallet open on computer and BTC gets stolen - comes on r/bitcoin asking redditors for help getting it back.  Luckily there are HODLers that have more sense :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:59:39
It's all a bit double standards though, what about news articles about wasted energy in other sectors, not to mention how plastic trashes the environment.   Renewable energy is the future, mining off solar, wind or hydro-electric will become the norm.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:56
Yup I think that's a part of bitcoin that the novice is not aware of tbh, in that in the early days standard transaction fees still got a pretty quick confirmation.  In fact I bought some stuff last week with standard transaction fee and it was confirmed in 2 hrs.   Mostly what led to steam pulling out for the time being I would say.

Watching the Unconfirmed Transactions on the rise all day, coinbase sent me an email earlier when it was 101,000, it's now clocking 201,500 and rising.   Gonna be a long wait for the weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:34
Interesting last statement there, are you saying that the mempool has a significant number of re-broadcasts in it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:49:05
I'm watching it now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:46:37
Don't worry I had 3 transactions stuck for 4 days and they all finally cleared on Saturday afternoon.  The mempool was up at 220k, it's only on 107k now so I expect it's got time to catch up.   The price was quite stable today and that helped alot reduce the transactions up until approx 18:00 GMT.   If tomorrow is the same you should see your low tx go through.     If you still can't wait it out post the tx id here and some kind soul may include it in a mining block.   I was worried it would never go through but it did eventually so feel your pain.
edit -

Nobody knows what's really going to happen with the price, he made the right decision for his family at this time.   He can always buy back in for his retirement fund.   Good job he still remembered how to access them eh!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:19
Not something I've seen before however transactions haven't been this crazy in such a lengthy period of time.
Currently you pay the higher transaction fee to cut the queue or wait it out with lower fees - be prepared to wait a few days though with this [backlog](
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:16:43
Personally I'd wait a few days and buy in the dip, however it depends on how much you plan on putting in and ultimately in is better than out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:02:43
It's been going down, I expect we'll see a recovery over the weekend, fingers crossed your tx gets through, I've been waiting 4 days but alas had std tx fee.    I think there should be a priority adjustment built in to a percentage of the oldest tx's otherwise it's to the back of the queue all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:45:07
nice link, cheers.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:03
Pushing mine to 1 whole BTC would be nice.  Goal a little further off after buying some xmas presents for family but it's worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:46:52
Omg, that was bad - they didn't even know bitcoin is divisible﻿ haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:09:54
How did you buy them at the atm?
You'll have your bank statements perhaps?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:14:12
Tell me about it, XCOM2 just gone on sale and I'd have thrown some BTC at that, I'm sure they'll re-adopt once it settle's down again (if it does ofc).
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:07:52
Entering the mainstream has probably pumped the demand up the most, articles in most of the broadsheets last week, hype over the $10k and new time investors throwing some change in ($100-$500) to see how it goes.   It will correct those new to bitcoin will withdraw, long time hodlers will buy, rinse and repeat :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:35:13
I'm from the Uk so I can only speak for the law's here.  Basically for a small amount I wouldn't worry about it however if you say had 1 BTC and wanted to cash that out to £ you may be eligible for capital gains tax.   Depending on your annual earnings and your tax bracket you may still be ok not to pay capital gains tax on the investment however for most people £14k (at time of writing for 1BTC) may push you into the bracket.  There is a handy [calculator at the HMRC website]( which allows you to calculate capital gain from shares based on initial investment and current cash out price.   You can run the questions anonymously and get an estimate.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:49:29
Yup 1% and enjoy it in your case :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:30:21
Depends how you much BTC you have and what your financial goals are in life.   If you bought in early I expect you can afford to draw some off and have a good christmas.  I've bought some online gifts in BTC and don't worry too much about the HODL as it's better to have something to show for it.   Whilst we all desire BTC to do well for various reasons if it completely fails what good was looking at those big numbers on a computer screen.   My advice, draw a little bit out (say 2-5%) and enjoy it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:51
Ah I see a pyramid scheme where everyone is free to cash in or out at their leisure with an unprecidented return on investment. ok thanks for that CNBC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:05:16
Had a good drop just, coming down already, now 198,000
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:51:57
It's hype and the bystander wants in without knowing what 'in' means.  Same analogy of joining a queue without knowing what you are queuing for.    The media went crazy last week at $10k, now everyone wants a piece of bitcoin, you neighbour, your familiy, your friends.   Best to hold on tight and ride the storm.    Only put in what you can afford to lose and pull it out when it's enough to meet your goal's in life (clear debt, buy a car, pay the rent etc etc).
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:49
No stores I'm aware of accept gold as payment, on the other hand BTC can buy me things and can act as a long term store of value.   BTC is the new Gold.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:17:24
That's true, same for me, and I sweat it at $400.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:19:13
You aren't alone, McAfee's mining operation will run a 2 petahash [hydro-electric facilty](  More effecient use of renewables (solar/wind) could also make mining less of an overhead.   I actually think the world is ready for this now however still $ to be made on oil. 
Edit - just to add I expect you are right in that moore's law will provide faster chipsets with greater efficiency - can quantum computers work the blockchain?  [Hmm scary stuff indeed if only true](
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:18
You can check the current backlog [here]( you're not alone.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:17:18
[Play this chart]( to give yourself an idea how the mempool clears based on the transaction fee you apply.   Your confirmations will cut the queue because miners will favour your tx over smaller tx fees.   You could have paid less however at the current outstanding transaction level probably would have waited a few days for a single confirmation.  If time wasn't an issue for the low tx's I'd have opted for a Std fee, sucks to wait though I get that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:15:28
satoshi cookies :) HODL
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:45
I think that's optimistic, I expect a correction at some point soon, this frenzy feels pumped however I expect little fish have been adding to the buying mania.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:13
If you know your public address (alpha numeric string) you can search it on     Keep any private keys secure though. GL.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:48
No probs.   It'll sort itself out hopefully, so much going on with the price rise the network does need it to correct and return to normal transaction confirmations - people have gifts to buy or more bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:22:34
Here's the meme ready for those friends/enemies.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:01:45
What a cracking collection - thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:01:33
Great thankyou.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:27:49
Great quote and so right.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:41:11
Transferred some BTC via a bitcoinpay merchant API and it all seems to have gone wrong.  Any clues as to why the URL redirects to confirmo.net?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:57:46
Thanks for the link.  This has been a few days now, I hope my retailer can source the transfer otherwise I'm out of pocket.  Not good news for any retailers using this mechanism and are unaware of the issue.
