solid strategy. i hope you don't mind me using it to get rich too.

this is sooooo correct. the only problem is people come to places like this to get an education. it's a bit of a catch 22 for the uninitiated and those are the people we need to build long lasting support.

nailed it right here.  that is the correct way to proceed.     
this movie is my favorite movie.  it is a true classic.  it doesn't rely on special effects etc.  it is just a good story.  it is really timeless too. the only thing that dates it is that there is a cell phone used in a scene and it is as big as a brick.

i think you are on point but i could see them viewing BTC as a proof of concept that they need to make fail.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:12:41
this is a key point. the world leaders do not appear to like the plebs to do anything that they cannot monitor. they would love to kill cash and also make sure that BTC, or any other crypto currency does not exist.     
    
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:35:33
cryptos are odd. when you look at money it is an avatar that represents the amount of work you can make other people do. you can apply that to a finished good (buying a pair of pants or a house) or on a labor (kid mowing your lawn). in economic terms a "coincidence of wants" is when i have something you want and vise versa. lets say i need corn and you need wheat. guess what... i have wheat and you have corn. what a coincidence!!! this almost never happens. usually you are faced with a "double coincidence of wants" which involves more people. i have wheat but want strawberries, you have corn but want wheat, another guy has strawberries but wants corn. i am going to have to traffic in corn to get strawberries... this wont work well. money solves this issue.        
Crypto is touted as a new type of money but it is more than that. it has an underlying technology. each coin can differ from the other in functionality. this leaves room for improvement, attempts for improvement, different implementations etc. if you were to try to improve USD it is going to be in the form of a new shape, image, color etc. there isn't anything to change. since we are talking computer science... things change rapidly over time.
    
i am not implying that BTC is, or will be , outdated. i am just pointing out that it runs a little deeper than a piece of paper that i keep in my wallet.
think of it like this. people put money into gold and silver. there are practical applications for each that gives them some value but mostly it is just hoarded as a value store. they both have slightly different industrial uses but there is room for both as an investment.

i was chatting with a friend about the BTC price recently. you see those memes that say "if you had bought X BTC in year Y you would be a millionaire".   
the thing is nobody would have held this long. you spend a dollar on something and it goes to $100.... most sane people will take profit before that.
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:22:30


I think that was the point in this post. He didn't like it and is choosing to do business with someone else.

this is a major X factor that makes investment difficult. Amazon traded at a good price, while losing money, for years (in the 1990's). people were buying into the idea. now that investment has paid off but it could have cut the other way. we could be asking why so many smart people poured money down the Amazon drain before it went under? instead we are talking about what a great investment they made.   
   
edit: added - (in the 1990's) - for clarity 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:44:28
i was talking about this over the weekend with some friends. i nearly put in $1000 when it was about $1. BTC was a pain in the ass to purchase and i eventually thought "i am trying too hard to throw away $1000" and didn't follow through.   
my friends instantly hone in on how many millions i would have @ today's price. i quickly told them that it isn't true. most likely i would have sold those at $100 per BTC and been.     
that is why you hear about people that find BTC on old machines and it is worth a ton. they forgot all about it. the early miners and investors nearly all sold early on...... as most reasonable people would have.

I agree. Coinbase has a low barrier of entry and most people won't have a problem with using them the same way you would any other legit bank. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:16:04
I think you have the wrong person mate. I use coinbase and have no issue with it but I understand why someone would choose to not use them.

@_date: 2017-11-08 17:15:27
the best bet is to move to a hard wallet, like a Trezor as they are difficult to hack as long as you are vigilant. with a hardware wallet you control your coin instead of the exchange. it's easy to look at an exchange as a bank but BTC are not FDIC insured so if they get stolen you're out of BTC with little recourse.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:56:42
my wife had an IRA that was fairly stagnant and not part of any retirement plans. we cashed it out and put it on BTC. so far it has been a great idea.

to be honest i don't think the government cares if someone else can break into your stuff as long as they can.     
your diminished privacy is not their concern it is their goal.

I think most people hear "encryption" and think about people doing secret spy stuff to secure their documents, chat etc. Heartbleed was pervasive and nobody cared or understood that it could be a problem for them. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:28:14
exactly. if people think the price will go up significantly why not buy in anyway? who cares if it is a whole BTC or not? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:40:23
coinbase has outages when there is a heavy load (people selling or buying). this could be a problem if you want to cash in and can't.   
also, the government does not see digital coins as money so they are not FDIC ensured. if the exchange gets hacked you lose your money.... that's it.   
generally you want to move the coin out to some sort of cold storage (offline). 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:50:38
"yeah baby. i started with a medium pizza and we are up to a a large... with 2 toppings!!!!!".    
joking aside that is the way to do it. i understand testing the waters. i am still nervous when i transfer e-coins from the exchange to my Trezor.... until the money comes through i am easily able to convince myself that i somehow transferred it to a wallet that is close to mine but isn't mine.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:49:19
nice. thats a great way to do it IMO

i think whoever Satoshi is he lost his wallet. maybe he was careless and had a harddrive crash.  that would be a good reason to not show up in public.    
i also think it was likely Hal. If i had created and lost a ton of value i would not tell my wife as it would just make her feel bad. i can see a scenario where he died and took his secret with him.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:21:34
I realize there is little possiblity that I would actually typo a wallet and hit a legit one that wasn't mine. I am usually cutting/pasting the address anyway.   
Regardless, it is nice to know someone shares my paranoia. As they say..... Look twice; drill once. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:09:38
coinbase. just because they are very easy to use. i can get paid, buy instantly with a credit card (get CC points) and then just pay my credit card..... win, win.     
the coin doesn't stay there. i move them to a trezor. i am fairly new to coin trading but i am developer that is very security conscious and it seems insane to me to not have your coins stored using a cold storage wallet device like a trezor or a ledger nano s.   
i have used  to dick around with trading some more obscure stuff and to sell some BCH. that worked but their UI is very "functional" and not so user friendly. i would use again though.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:40:50
I'm still buying. $500 every now and then. I'm buying fractions too but I still hope to make profit. So..... I wish us both luck.

it's not mostly math symbols but it also isn't something grandma is going to read and absorb. at a minimum you need a basic understanding of asymmetric cryptography which leave a lot of people out of the loop.

it may be "old fashioned" but there is plenty of economic theory around the value of having something now and having more later. if not then banks would never be able to make loans and credit cards wouldn't exist.

but guys... terrorists!!!!! we need this bill!!!!   
    
the worst part is they do this shit and don't index it to inflation. next thing you know are kids are illegal because their paycheck is $10,001. and if that day comes they will still use the law to fuck people even though it is outside of the laws intent.  
back in the day congress passed Alternative Minimum Tax. it should have been called the Rockefeller ta because it was specifically created to target the insanely rich who were using too many tax shelters. a few years back i got hit with it!!!! i am not not rich. the bill was not tied to inflation so more and more people get caught up in it. the thing that probably triggered it was a tax credit for an alternate fuel vehicle that i claimed. i had not other write offs at the time... no kids, no mortgage... nothing.
