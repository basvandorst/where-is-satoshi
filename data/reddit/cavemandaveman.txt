USD is not more risk and far more fungible.  I have assets in property, cash, foreign currency, hedge funds .. stocks ... all around the world and less than 10% of that in crypto.  The stuff in crypto is a totally fucking lottery. Im way better off to just buy another property and rent it out that to fuck around with crypto when shit like this happens  almost every second week.  For a professional investor it has to little to offer. The crypto space is mostly just a bunch of teenage jurk offs all running around scamming each other then jerking off some more.  Throwing 100k into cold storage and hoping for moon with out any rational is just a gamble. its not an investment and there are more reliable returns on 100k out there than cold storage. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:12:45
and the logic in that argument is .... ?
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:01:13
Yeah its called inflation.  But your over simplifying a far more complex global economic system its not like economists don't understand the limits of printing money, or that the largest economic and military power in the world is going to disappear tomorrow. When google has a market cap of 500B and ETH what ? 1B,  If I walked down the road tomorrow with 250K USD I can put it into property and still have a house and an income stream.  I can't do shit with crypto other than get fleeced by some fuckers who "got hacked"  fuck that.

Dude that bulshit.  I need my coins to actually return something, I'm not just going to leave 100k on a flash drive and hope its worth more in a year because of some moon event. I have to put them up for lending on an exchange otherwise I'm better off to just cash out and would get better returns with less risk using USD with out this crap.     
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:02:45
Firstly the labeling of this .... "socialized" doesn't even come into it.  Bitfinx is no different from any other stock broker who screwed up and gambled or lost customer funds. There limited liability just saves the owners from losing there personal assets but as far as the company goes its fucked and we are all creditors no matter if it was BTC or the payment for the water cooler. There are strict rules about this and the company has to be liquidated. Like every other broker that went bust. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:49:20
For starters they should be shutting down bitfinx. These guys really think they can just lose 60m screw over all the BTC customers and just keep going like nothing happened.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:13:39
I'm serious BTC has no value if you can only leave it in cold storage or on a flash drive. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:33:56
Who has the mug shots of these retards who facilitated the theft of 60m of other peoples money and think its not a big deal. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:07:18
You cant just kick the BTC accounts.  Every one is fucked. The regulators should have come in by now and freezed all funds locked up the office and put a block on any of the owners accounts. In any normal jurisdiction that would have already happened.  People need to understand that you don't lose $60m and not go to jail.  There is no more bitfinx..  The only question is how much in customer funds did they have so we can figure out what the haircut is going to be. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:57:54
The only way to do it is to issue a new shitfinx coin.  Lets say they only have 20% of the customer funds left. So they take the price as of the hack in BTC of every other coin or currency and you end up getting just 20% of what you had and the other 80% in shitfinx coin. shitfinx coin wont be worth shit but it represents a percentage ownership in the company and pays out on all future profits. People can then trade it and dump it as they like  
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:20:14
I guess its the human condition. Bitcoin seemed to attract all the wrong people. I don't really see too many of the lets make the world a better place people left in the bitcoin space. I some times wonder if Nakamoto saw it coming way back then wiped his hard drive and just moved on.         
@_date: 2016-04-14 07:25:08
This is all speculation and conjecture, We really have no idea what happened. Also being hacked and telling people about it really has little bearing on the Awesomeness of a company or how its run.  Security is just hard and its an up hill battle. There are plenty of companies that fail because they spent all their resources on a secure system that no one ever used.     EDIT spelling

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:47:15
Sure every one wants the best deal. Here is the problem I have with dark pools ... only the people running the pool know if you are getting the best deal or not.  A dark pool just adds further ambiguity to the system and they are ripe for all kinds of exploits. I don't think this in any way helps promote the cause.

@_date: 2015-06-27 04:30:28
It works both ways. Anonymity naturally breads corruption. It you have a functional democracy and complete transparency then all of a sudden it gets really hard for large power brokers to get away using there wealth and influence for personal gain at the expense of every one else.

@_date: 2015-06-11 13:29:53
Personally I wouldn't go near it. The problem with supposed dark pools is that they usually turn out to be fully lit for the exchanges own bots algos or prop traders in other ways. They also just create a 2 tear system where the average dude just needing to do a fair trade is always the loser.    One more BTC turn off making me think its just time I sold all my coins and be done with it.

International remittance works some of the time but not that well yet. So here is my experience. 
I typically need to send sums around $20,000 between places like Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. 
1) There is huge counterpart risk, Exchange or whatever goes down Think Gox and all your moneys gone.
2) There is very limited lequitity, volume and or no where to exchange in most places.  No one wants to buy $20,000 of bit coin in one go on localbitcoins for any thing like the market price.
3) Volatility and volume problems mean you end up trading bitcoin when you just wanted to transfer money to pay someone.     
4) You still have to transfer the money to some where to buy the bitcoin in the first place. For example sending the bank wire to some exchange like bitstamp in USD that often cost you $50 in bank fees any way.
Having said that I did use Gox very profitability in the past to do remittance and it worked.

Yeah but we are talking about different stuff here. bit coin was designed to pseudo anonymous as well as to have transparency...   With out a central authority it can only be community and democratically regulated . That means when I pay some doggy merchant $50 and he  fails to deliver.. we can all beat the crap out of him because the block chain don't lie and it cant scam you with bs.   I'm pretty happy with the current setup up with out the need to go stealth

Ha ha.. awesome 
 .. I cant translate that perfectly but the summary of the article is that our man comes across very polite the neighbors don't see him much but he speaks nice Japanese and has a typical nice JP wife about 30,. they married 2 years ago and have a 2 year old kid. They actually do their shopping in one of those  650cc yellow number plate cars that you don't need to own a carpark to buy.... The house is in a good tokyo neighborhood not far from the old GOX office and rents for about $4000 a month, at the pricier end of tokyo prices but not extreme... However things start to look a little shady when it turns out he is also renting a flash 280/ms apartment in Megro for more like $15,000 a month. Seems like the wife and kid also took off back at the end of January apparently telling the neighbors they were fairly suddenly heading to Canada..  Apparently the neighbors always saw him in pretty much the same sweeter. And his son it like a mini me mark K

@_date: 2014-10-02 07:03:03
It could be argued why should you get interest ? I mean its not like you are doing any thing or taking much risk by putting your money in a bank. Sure in theory the bank takes your 5k and lends it to some dude who needs a lone to get a home. But that's not what happens any more. What happens is the fed prints some cash basically gives  it to the bank for free at 1% interest or something then they use that money to lend to the dude who want the house.  The bank doesn't need you or want your money.

There are still plenty of other attractive features of a crypto currency that give it utility but have nothing to do with avoiding state censorship.

well summarized.  sorry It took me some time to figure that out. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 09:32:32
Short answer is because the only real grounds for dismissal is doing something illegal. 
Unless you actually bankrupt your company no matter how crap the guy is as long as he turns up to work sleeps at his desk then leaves at the allotted time you can't legally give him/her the boot.   Even if you "eliminate his/her position" your still obligated to keep paying him and find him something else to do.        
Basically you have to agree to be fired so you have to offer him a package to agree to leave.
If you don't follow procedure and he/she takes it to the courts its a drawn out process you are not going to win then eventually maybe years later the court will award him a package something similar to what you would have had to offer him to leave in the first place.
Al that generate lots of bad PR for your company and your just better off giving him a deal he cant refuse.  
@_date: 2015-07-31 05:58:59
He did everything wrong. There are no laws I know of that explicitly require you to open your eyes while driving.  
However if your driving down the road or running a business with you fucking eyes closed,  then you crash and burn taking out a few 1000 innocent bystanders in the process you are not going to walk free from the wreck.

seems like these days there is no love in running an exchange unless your planning on running off with the customers funds
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:53:45
It maybe does, but in this case it clearly hasn't.  The way this operator works is to employ global sales reps who are on commission to sign up as many merchants as possible. They may have KYC on paper but clearly there is zero incentive for there 3rd party sales reps in some overseas jurisdiction to follow it, so nothing to stop the scmmers getting a cc merchant account.

All true, However the work to safely deploy a block size increase has been done and tested.  It was started 2 years ago and even planed for release before it blew up and became a continuous issue. The end result was the some people getting kicked off the dev team while we spent another year building segwit and a ton of other not particularly used features that actually included a block size increase any way, and here we are today.

A well reasoned response I agree fully with, One of the more intelligent comments I have seen on reedit in a while.  There are of course many different jobs that have different degrees of challenges many so called jobs including well paid middle management roles  in large companies are often a from of institutionalized  welfare.  I see many people stuck in the same job for 10 years well paid however really just part of the economic machine, not actually contributing any thing to humanity other then the shuffling of emails to there counterparts and never particularly amounting to any thing of greatness.  Many other jobs are really no more than economic slavery where people are working them selves into a worse situation than had they not otherwise devoted that time an d energy to another purpose.   
There are certainly highly motivated people who can do great things whit their lives. Every one would like to think that are in that category, some of these people are also gifted but out of all the Want to be Elon;s,  There are simply 100s of others equally gifted but simply not as lucky people. There are literally millions of million ears but I wonder how many actually change the world.

dude the chance of that happening is zero.  Reality check global fx market is maybe 2 or 3 trillion daily. bitcoin market cap is 3.5 billion.  Put it in perspective Google market cap is (correction  429 billion) . Mark Zuckberg net worth (correction 35b)  billion.. To get a country with a GDP of 3.5b you would have to pick some shitty place in Africa or some small as island country with population say less than 1m people.  So lets say some nation needs 1 billion dollars to fund some infra structure project.  Firstly 1b gets you fuck all. sure you can build maybe a hospital or school but that's about it. Then what you are going to borrow that 1 billion from the bitcoin community. And then what sell it for USD so you can pay international contractors to build those roads and schools. .. So even if you did that you would still owe the freeking 1 billion worth of bitcoins, or say 4 million BTC at todays prices that you think is going to skyrocket meaning you own like double when you have to pay it back ??       
Its just not workable that way.

Think of this as the best possible motivation you could have.  
When you know your right there is nothing more satisfying or more motivating than being able to totally leave people for dead at their own game.  Let me put it this way. When I was in grade school I couldn't even read until I was 13 years old. My teachers practically told my parents I was retarded. Now I have 3 university degrees and make 10X what primary school teachers make. Go stick it to the man.

Well said.
While innovation is good and some of the alt coins offer real alternative features, some of which may one day have a use. Copying the bit coin source code, changing a few variables and then calling a it a new currency isn't exactly innovative. LTC has for me always been just a fun little game a few people were playing and experimenting with. Its a play money distraction to the real coin that has no advantage over bit coin.

Same here down under. credits cards always had a very low reputation. They are associated with people who cant afford to by something, and well if you need to buy something on credit then you probably should not be buying it in the first place. They are also a world of pain. It always worked me up when traveling overseas when then phone company wont give you a phone contract or even some bar that wont serve you until you hand over a credit card.

I do this for a living.. Short answer is they spend 100s of millions of dollars but often still don't get it right..... 
They hire developers with 10 to 20 years experience building proprietary matching engines but pay them as little as possible then replace most of them with offshore staff after adding large middle management layer and exceeding hardware budget.
They then spend countless weekends benchmarking and tuning for every possible bottle neck. However despite this there are still also plenty of fuck ups, say for example every time there is a Facebook ipo.  After media attention, Typically they then blame said IT guys for fuck up but fail to resolve, investigate or even  understand true cause of the issue. 
Finally after weathering PR storm for failure they elect to spend more money and expand middle management layer....
IT guy then quits and lives happier ever after on new found bitcoin wealth... :-)

Dude 150k is not going to change your life. It sounds like a lot when your 25 but if you have professional job after you graduate and you work couple of years its hardly enough for a deposit on some where that you need to live in many parts of the world.   My advice do nothing. unplug the laptop with the wallet put in a safe place and come back in 5 years.

Its basically a business that make money out of the customers misery.. In Japan and in the EU central bank interest rates are basically 0.  I had plenty of cash and a decent income in Japan .... I asked the bank for a debit card so I can actually function online and buy shit.  Guess what they don't have debit cards and force you to get a credit card.. Then they charge you $500 a year because its gold or something and includes some super points that I really don't want.. Give me bit coin any day

No its not a problem that money in is not the same as money out.. its not a closed system. This is not different to how any stock float works.  Say a venture fund decides to float a new company they start with a few individual investors. who put in cash for a start up but they issue stock at a best price they think people will buy it at well above what they first put in. The stock trades on a free market and at that point people put in cash. But the company can still more or less just make up or issue new shares if it wants.

All these problems are known as the system matures over the last couple of years we have seen many of them worked out. This has been reflected in the price.
