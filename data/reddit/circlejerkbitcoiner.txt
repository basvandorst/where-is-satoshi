Time to hardfork. \s

"... says every insolvent company ever."
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:08:37
Nah. The bottom is not in yet. This will go way lower if 125k BTC was stolen. I will buy cheap bitcoins in a few days.
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:03:41
Because this is a possibility:

@_date: 2016-08-02 22:11:42
Trust in exchanges as a whole was even more destroyed today. I bet it will go way lower in the next few day(s).

isn't even a bitcoin sub anymore. It's more like They are like buttcoin but more specialized.
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:37:56
He also forgot only ~46% of world population use the internet at all.

As a former r/btc user i rather endure rampart cen...ship than wasting my time with the hate-cesspool r/btc has become. The sub is in a sad state unfortunately. Only the haters are left.
If you want to scare away bitcoin newbies just send them to r/btc.

What fuck are you talking about? The blockchain is 90GB and only grows linearly at a maximum 144mb/day. 
You can buy a 10TB HDD for $400 today.
It will take **200 years** for the blockchain to reach 10TB at the current block size.
You can probably buy 100TB HDDs for even less money in a few years from now.
HDD size just doesn't matter for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:49:14
I think there is a website for it. Google "whattomine".
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:17:28
You would mine something other than Bitcoin and trade it.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:46:23
I, too, am in favour of new echochamber functionality.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:36:33
From college straight to retirement. Thanks bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:47:38
That's why you don't sell... 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:05:31
It went from 50% to 60% market cap in a day. If this continues even the last bitcoin holders will jump ship. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:07:01
Strange, the first site i found says 97.8% of NYC has access to 25mbps+ and 72.6% has access to 100mbps+ which is also what i would have expected. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:08:13
I've never seen a bitcoin accepted here sign in rl. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:01:46
Just hosted two non-UASF nodes to counter the UASF spam.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:51:29
There's only one winner in this war. And it's neither UASF nor the "legacy" chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:09:22
Maybe try living closer to other humans.
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:37:36
Altcoin posts are now allowed?
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:22:14
Zero is not an impossiblity but an inevitability.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:09:50
Who are the ETH shills you are referring to? It's just 90% of Bitcoin users i personally know are already diversified into ETH.
UASF will be EXTREMELY bad for the price ratio. No one wants to hold Bitcoin during a minority hardfork. If ETH didn't crash by then UASF will almost guarantee the flippening.        
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:45:23
TIL gambling can lose you money. I'm enlightened. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:20:03
ETH already has Finneys...
They have official names.
 Huge opportunity for Bitcoin lost again.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:17:55
For normal investments that may be true but everyone knows bitcoin grows through bubble cycles. So that is exactly what you should do. All the years it never failed. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:07:51
Maybe first world country but third world area. Why care about the 5% rural outback?
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:01:38
UASF will never get enough traction. Too dangerous. Will be funny to see how that plays out.

Because he's a troll. There is no professionalism in bitcoin development. It's a kindergarten. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:04:09


Because it doesn't need good news. Bitcoin itself is sufficient.


You take reddit too seriously to measure sentiment. There are are at most few hundred people online. That means the total active reddit community is in the lower ten thousands at most. Subscriber count is meaningless - mostly inactive accounts and bots. 
The reddit community does not even represent 1% of bitcoin users but the most hardcore fanatics and trolls.
Most people here don't get the perspective outside the small reddit echochambers.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:21:21
I see you don't like money.
It's a huge adoption hurdle.
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:23:42
Are you stupid? Double spend? Did you ever visit a restaurant? You pay at the end but you can leave at any time. How that magic works? They just call the cops if you leave without pay.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:52:18
Just spun up a BU node because you called me a Spartan.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:44:59
Stop trying to make UASF happen. It's not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:43:57
ok 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:02:19
Nope. It will be a feature in the future once crypto development is more mature and can scale. It's waaay to soon for that. Bitcoin is myspacing.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:47:17
With the upcoming UASF hardfork the conservative plan doesn't include Bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:12:15
UASF will not happen. You are wasting your time. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:23:43


Uhm, you can't know that with Bitcoin either. 40% wants to hardfork the network to EC which is dangerous according to our experts.


Because there are clues how many tokens there will ever be. Long term store of value is an idea, not reality. In reality all cryptos are a speculative investement at best, gambling at worst. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:49:41
So did you follow any advice from the last post?
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:35:15
Everything i read from Eric Lombrozo comes across as extremely reasonable. Might change my opinion on UASF...
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:15:19
Bull trap
