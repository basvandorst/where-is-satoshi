Thanks, but why you think so? :D 
(You 're the first one complementing it)

That argument for not having rare metals as store of value, thus reducing their price, thus benefiting humanity is, well, a pretty damn good argument!

And it's up to who to decide what speed is appropriate ? He is just a fast talker but his English is correct and straight. Just quick. Check his speeches from the past,  same speed.
( I'm not native speaker too though)
I watched this video 5 times because **it is not about me** but about what massive thing just has happened.

Absolutely mind blowing!  I am so happy to be alive and experience this monumental moment. Must feel like being there when bitcoin launched in 2009.
Just as the lightning cofounder said:" 
From me to Singapore to Brazil, back to Singapore and to me. Bam. It's done" 
Beautiful.

Thanks for sharing your feeling! I think it is quite valuable that you share your thoughts and why you get feelings of depression.
I get a similar feeling while reading all those success stories (like damn, I should have gotten in more early and  more aggressive stuff). However, I feel I am not get depressed, because I have a goal in mind:
financial security by buying/building a house. With traditional financial banking it would take me about 25 years to pay it off. I put a couple of thousand euros over the last 18 moth into crypto, in small portions month by month (couple of hundreds). I am now about 1/4 towards my goal and I will keep building up my portfolio for the next 2 to 3 years.  If overall Crypto is in a bubble and crashes dramatically, so will my portfolio and I fall back to the 25 years for paying off my future house. 
However, if it's not crashing so hard or recovering over the next 2/3 years, I will either have a bunch of own capital for my credit or will be able to pay my house of completely. I have a chance on that.
This kind of strategy for my future keeps me staying motivated in reading into Bitcoin and other Cryptos technology, believing in the idea of financial alternatives and independence. And when the next guy shows off with his Tesla or Lambo pics, I keep on smiling and think: yeah, lucky you, but one day ...

Ever looked for some Meetups in your area? Check out the app, I love it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:59
Please re-do?  This is massively huge news... check out the function in YouTube to slow down speed of video. 
This guys is lightning in person :-)

You could make a softfork that in every coinbase transaction (the one where the miner gets the reward) half of the reward has to go to a burn address. Otherwise other miners would not accept that transaction. 
Then you effectively reduce the bitcoin in circulation but he total amount of mined bitcoin would remain same.

 That's why I started to go to Meetups and how I found my new job :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:46:51
That's awesome :-) let's upvote this post and support.
I'll send couple of bucks on the weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:34:59
Agree, basically.
2 points:
a) Good thing is the cap of 350,000$ and b) of course I would not send more than 5-10$.
There is a risk to loose all money I send but that comes with most projects in crypto.

Was on a birthday party this weekend and talked in front of 12 people how crypto will revolutionize our system like email did in the mid 90s. 
4 of them ignored me, 5 were listening without reaction, 1 was a bit interested, 1 wished me good luck with this "bitcoin thing" and 1 guy asked me 4 hours about everything I knew. 
This one guy will now come to our next Blockchain/Crypto Meetup :-)

Why Not? Raising attention by showing how big the community is? 
Also people who get started with bitcoin tend to switch over to all kinds of crypto after getting the point.

It does matter: sending from your untrue bitcoin wallet (which actually holds BCH) to a bitcoin wallet on an exchange (which holds BTC). 
-&gt; As a user does not hold the private key to this exchange BCH wallet there is only Good-will of the exchange to decide to refund him.
Not attacking the Big Block concept whatsoever here but this missmatch is just very bad for crypto. 
Why do we mess up building up trust in crypto always by greed driven mistakes of heavy weighted stake holders INSIDE the crypto space??? 
Good popcorn drama for big banks...

The incentive is that you can do a freelancer job in Taiwan and a small customer in a corrupt region in South America or Africa can pay you directly for that. (Assuming you can do your freelancer job online). 
Once BTC price saturates, payments in Satoshi will be a common thing around the globe. When?
-&gt; 5, 10 maybe 25 years? 
Until then pricing in $,€,£,¥,₩ to agree on a BTC value can be a good temporary solution to bridge the problem.

You can't compare this because for PayPal you need a bank account. 
If you don't have legal papers in a country and you need money to bribe the city office and security guy at the bank entrance and the guy at the counter to open a bank account... 
Imagine to support a village in rural area of India where there is no running water but simple smartphones with QR readers and mobile internet. 
I have been there and saw it myself. Crypto is revolutionary for them.
Bye the way:
PayPal CEO recently stated that bitcoin fulfils the dream they always had : a global borderless payment system. 
(Please don't let me look it up on Google but the message was was like that)

Technically not  correct: the halving does not reduce the supply by half but the inflation.

For a 5 year old: you put 10$ worth of bitcoin on the blockchain and you get chips, which you can use to pay others very easily and quickly. Others accept your chips because they know they can go to the blockchain, give the chips and get bitcoin back any time.

Keep in mind that on the futures market, every short (bet on falling price) needs to be taken by another person who goes long (bet on raising price). Think otherwise: If everybody on the futures market was shorting, who would pay them?
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:37:14
This. Beautifully explained :-)

First of all, hash rate is one part of the underlying tech: it's to build and maintain a permissionless ledger. And as others already pointed out: mining reward + tx fee and hash rate are in correlation. And secondly, price is in correlation to demand which is adoption. These  3 pillars are interdependent and that's the reason why it took several years for bitcoin to take off and why it will take years to stabilize towards equilibrium.

If you believe in the underlying tech then what you are doing is just exemplary! Buying in at ATH and then crashing can be so frustrating. My old boss did exactly this (buy in close to Decekmber ATH) and then sold everything at loss **headshaking**.
