Look up civil forfeiture.

Nice! Does it then work to say that if we change to 0,5%, it would double at approximately every 140 (2*70) days? And likewise, if the increase is 2%, every 335 (70/2) days? 
More than anything, thanks for the use of 'compounded', I finally have something to google and read up on. Cheers!

Thanks for defining an assumption. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:03
Yeah I’m not gonna go through all that, when the first one I clicked tries to smear Wikileaks because that asshat Trump praises them. By your own standard, you shouldn’t care about anything that comes from his mouth. 
The other point it made is that WL and Trump junior correspondence, which I think could easily be Assange honeypotting them. Maybe not the best move, but we still don’t know the context.

Yeah this is more of a theoretical thing to use for any crypto and in any time span. More of an exercise in exponential growth, than anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:59:50
Holy shit. 
And thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:58:29
Saved it! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:02:40
Are you sure you know what context means? We have literally just a correspondence to go by, and no idea about the precursor, the motive or anything else to *provide* context. 
Dems loved him when he fucked up Bush, but now he’s suddenly trying to MAGA and build a wall? Bullshit. 
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:59:00
He's saying they can protest for democracy without having been a democracy, and then you missed his sarcasm.

Or the next gen, being faster, cheaper, more secure (?) and less of an energy drain. 
BTC will absolutely have its final ATH, but I agree it won’t be anytime soon.

I wish I invested more in my wife, she’s grown exponentially since we first dipped.

Which fork? Fork’s off, bro!
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:49:11
[removed] though.
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:38:43
How? I hope you're not just being pedantic, as I'd love any input that remotely differs from the usual "BTC will literally never stop growing" attitude that seems to dominate these subs.
I believe in it myself, but would like a more nuanced image of what potential dangers can be.

As I've only been in the game for 4 weeks, but every single thursday or friday has started with a sudden whale climb and an insane drop, I'm shitting my pants now.
E: it [begins?](
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:46:07
How do you recover if you lose it? I’m getting anxiety thinking about carrying potentially thousands of dollars around. Especially considering the new owner also have access to my house and computer. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:35:45
Called it ;)

Yeah kudos for the balls, but the kid is in no way fit to preach, like he seems to think.

I imagine it’s quite fun to drive, who gives a shit about showing off. I’ll tint my windows anyway 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:17:35
It’s incredibly fun to see how huge interest there is, in something only a tiny fraction is invested in. Seems likely there’s a hell of a flood coming. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:42:20
This is the kind of comments I wanted to see; objective, well thought out and easily phrased.
Thanks, I'll look more into the Segwit2x thing!

Fucking hell, $4m at an all time high. So sorry man, hope things work out for you.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:06:40
That was the value during the collapse? I'd at least tell myself theres no way I'd manage to hold them that long, but I'd never stop doing the math of what I *potentially* couldve had.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:24:56
Jesus fuck. When was this? And you never bought either when seeing it grow?
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:35:58
I thought so as well, just don't understand the arbitrary price then.
