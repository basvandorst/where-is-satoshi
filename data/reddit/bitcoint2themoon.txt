if you have money already in 401k/IRA you can move them to bitcoinira -- but it might need to be a previous employer 401k, not current employer.
Or you can take a loan out against your 401k, take that cash and buy crypto on your own. Still have to pay back loan, unless you are old enough (59+)
Not a tax expert but IRS will want a cut of gains any way you slice it.    
401k/IRA - pay taxes on withdrawl    
Roth IRA - pay taxes on deposit    
you buy - pay capital gains when you cash out or convert to a different cypto    
not sure if I totally get what you are asking, but if you mean borrow from 401k to buy bitcoin not sure if the law will allow but it might. Maybe your investment company will even offer a crypto fund to put 401k money into.

one of them realizes they got 100000 btc in 2010 and forgot about it, then they proceed to go nuts searching for the passphrase

keep in ledger, you get the free fork coin 
BUT you have to be super careful selling it or you will lose bitcoin to hacks

I used bitcoinira and they are insured against theft or other loss of coin by fire, disaster, etc. Not having to worry is a major plus.
You will not be able to access your fork coin quickly. That can be bad if the first sellers get the highest price, but I'd be afraid to be a first seller with the possibility of replay attack or other hack. Eventually they add the ability to access forked coin, after everything is tested for safety.

when ACH is going they block all withdrawals 
this could be a good thing if you were trading on gemini and wanted to know your acct wasnt going to be hacked and robbed. Just ACH a little money in every 5 days.

not sure... probably not fine tuned details like if you ACH then ALL your shit is locked not just the latest ACH
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:08:44
hackers can get in, or other bad things happen, and then ur screwed

these exchanges like coinbase and kraken want all kinds of identity info - one reason is to coop with irs. So you can roll dice and if you are a tiny fish irs might ignore - but they can get ya. Better believe IRS is doing everything imaginable to get "their" money. 
No cash out = no gains
maybe when it's billions you move to Switzerland and renounce USA citizenship?

check their twitter, they give answers there
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:21:11
you move your coin off coinbase for added safety
