I’m being 100% accurate. The down voting only proved my point.
There’s no value in allowing fascists to think their behavior is acceptable.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:56:15
Agreed. I’m sorry Reddit fascists are down voting your comment because they’re butt hurt from 2018 still. 
Bravo for staying above the fray sir. This is about bitcoin not your political  party preference.

BIG TELL: this tweet is curated. Trump doesn’t use such language.
Nice try Mick Mulvaney.

It's because andreas antenoplolis didn't speak
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:23:58
Then add it to twitter then.

Lookup smartmesh
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:14:50
They won't let them. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:53:31
If only they had bought bitcoincashunlimited.com and bitcoincashabc.com
@_date: 2019-11-28 21:22:45
Well I have bitcoincashunlimited.com, bitcoincashabc.com, and bitcoincashsv.org on the sales floor right now
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:06:21
Lets be real...probably uncircumcised.
Going to eat the tip. Just the tip.
@_date: 2019-11-29 05:25:20
Could use some malicious downloads don’t you think?

Found a CNN fan over here!
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:35:39
It's not spam jack ass.  You guys just got busted. I have screenshots. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:04:18
Go to cryptograffiti 
You will see BCH guys doing manipulation today.
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:38:57
Don’t worry. Someone is giving him the same treatment at   and it’s hilarious!
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:46:33
That's where you're not getting it.
It can be.
That's trolling BCH. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 05:13:50
 Constitution bub. Look it up. 
Let me know if you need any help with the big words.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:05:56
You get a warrant! You do a search. I’m tired of hearing these lazy arguments of how do we go after criminals and wrongdoers. But that was never really the point was it? I wish someone would have stood up right then and confronted him, but no. They would never go after their precious Obama.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:49:59
We need an explanation. We need an investigation. There should be correlating IP addresses for every take down. We should demand nothing less.
@_date: 2019-12-25 04:15:22
First they came for gun videos and no one fought back.
Second, they came for crypto videos and...
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:36:08
Section 230 asshole. They don’t deserve protection.
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:07:18
If you’re pro fiat you’re a fascist scumbag
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:57:56
Conflict creates awareness.  
Awareness is steroids to the crypto community. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:21:29
To add to this...You get a WARRANT and place bugs and cameras you fascist f—-!
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:14:04
China has over 60 TRILLION of DEBT. Sorry but this guy is fake news and clearly consumes the same. Lol he thinks China doesn’t have debt!
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:16:37
Do you think this trustee has an affinity towards bitcoin or those injured by the hack? Is he operating in his own interest? Is he allowed to short btc? Where is the oversight in this system? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:22:29
You don't understand market forces. When you have a limited supply and downward selling pressure it effects price.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:18:43
They didn't even buy the domain 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:20:32
Many would still hodl because we are in a bear market. We have found a lot of support at 7k
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:23:44
Because the Mt Gox hack didn't effect price right?
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:20:02
Bcash got hijacked back with  lol
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:40:50
Your trustee is destroying bitcoin with the sell offs. You should give customers their bitcoin back. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:31:44
Look at any given chart for that time.
A Mt Gox redux only hurts bitcoin more.  If you don't understand this point you will never understand from someone on the Internet explaining it to you.
