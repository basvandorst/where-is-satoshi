Considering you and Satoshi have zero concept of what money is, I highly doubt you would understand.

People have a misunderstanding how fiat is created. It is lent into existence meaning at some point it is also withdrawn when loans are repaid. Bitcoin creation is permanent outside of lost coins.
3600 coins created daily with a fiat value of $2.1million. Bitstamp's active bid book is around $10million.
Every 5 days bitstamp's bidbook is created for no good reason.

You have to compare dollar creation to the stock that already exists. For example the Fed is creating 1 trillion per year of dollar credit, relative to the 59 trillion which already exist that is a drop in the bucket. Also dollars are retired when debts are repaid, it's a different process. Bitcoin conjures up bitstamp's entire bidbook every 5 days in comparison.

Miners are being paid $35-50 PER transaction they secure. Talk about inefficient.

A nation of criminals embraces bitcoin. No surprise.

Yea but there is no reason for the creation of bitcoin's in the first place as they do not represent anything. The 21million cap was just a number picked out of a hat.
Bitcoin is based on the quantity theory of money which is linear based. Bitcoins get minted regardless if there is a demand for them or not. This contributes to volatility, especially on the downside. Bitcoin is heavily skewed to rewarding "miners" for essentially doing very little, since it doesn't matter how many transactions they confirm they get paid.

Bitcoin is volatile because coins are conjured up out of thin air regardless if they are demanded or not.

You want a headline?
3600 BTC created every 24 hours out of thin air.

You can't do basic math? 3600 coins X $575 each divided by 60,000 transactions.
Comes to $34.50 to secure 1 transaction. This is costlier then any other transfer system.
The bitcoin network currently is heavily underutilized and is basically an wealth transfer mechanism to miners and early adopters. Daily transactions need to exceed 500,000+ to support the current subsidies.

What are you talking about? Someone has to pay the $2.1 million per day of inflation.
