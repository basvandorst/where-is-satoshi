... If you want to risk it.. if it were me I would not risk a standard VPN. Service providers have ways of detecting VPN usage. 
However, RDP-ing to a machine that is legitimately located in a supported country and then using GDAX from that machine would not raise any flags.

Some guys bought some bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:17:43
Probably. But maybe not. However, if it does, it will definitely go up (or down).
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:30:54
This is a repost from back in (i wanna say December?) and I think OP is just saying “Look how everyone laughed at people believing it would go down back then.” and.. sure enough.. looks like it’s gonna happen.
