On 07/15/11: We ran a logo contest for our Bitcoin mining company. Only one person submitted, so he won by default...
7.5 BTC! (Worth $105 then, $88875 now...)

Most news sites are blogs and allow anyone, like Roger Ver, to post bogus advertisements for altcoins or phishing sites along side legitimate news. You wasted more time responding to my post then looking at my site which probably means you are a paid shill.

Sent $10k worth of Bitcoin ($7 fee); Confirmed in Less then 10 minutes. Switching to BCash doesn't fix the mining pool monopoly. ASICBOOST, Spam Transactions, and No Segwit. No bueno.

Price will really take off after halving. Before will be lots of sideways, but net positive. (~2x)
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:47:38
WRONG!!! Sure, there are still many early UTXO's (Satoshi) that used Pay-to-Public-Key which IS vulnerable to quantum computers, but everyone since has switched to the much safer Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash. Using this scheme ensures that your public keys are not revealed until you issue a transaction. For best security your wallet will automatically send the remaining balance (change) back to a newly generated public-key-hash.
Even if a quantum attacker could reverse ECDSA and generate a private key from a given public key, they'd still need to reverse the one-way hash function first. (If you're afraid of a quantum attacker - - - DO NOT REUSE ADDRESSES)
To increase our resistance to quantum attacks we could increase the length of future hashes. (SHA-512)
We also have the FATTEST CANARY in the coal mine. If Satoshi's coins move, it's time to upgrade. ;-)

Where's the documentary on two rogue U.S. Secret Service agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force, getting caught and sentenced to prison for stealing funds (and coercing/escalating Ulbricht into using "violence") while investigating the Silk Road and the poor kid they entrap gets locked up on two life sentences + 40 years using their flimsy as fuck evidence? I wanna see that. Call it "Agent Provocateurs" or something.

*"People want an authority to tell them how to value things, but they choose this authority not based on facts or results. They choose it because it feels authoritative and familiar."*
Bitcoin is more about trust then money. Money just happens to be how most people denominate, earn, and transfer trust. The less people you need to trust to function today, the less room there is for corruption tomorrow.
*"I have a feeling in a few years people are going to be doing what they always do when the economy tanks. They will be blaming immigrants and poor people."*
Turn on any propaganda station and tell me how this isn't their message about the economy, politics, and society at large.
*"You know, once we sell, we'll be just like the rest of them. You know that."*
Instead of worrying about price we should be worrying about how we'll change when that price grants us power over others. We must strive to be better than them.
*"No we're not, we're not the bad guys here. We didn't defraud the American people and prey on their dreams of owning a home. They did. Now we get to kick them in the teeth."*
We shouldn't be happy if we become rich at the expense of someone else becoming poor. Wealth acquisition is a zero-sum game. We must reinvest in decentralized, open-source projects with clear goals that take power from those who squander it and give it to the mathematical divinity we're collectively building on the Internet.

In the future follow a **STRICT** hierarchy:
* Development - run BTC / LND in "simnet" mode. Generate your own blockchain. Limit access to developer(s) only. Test your code, backups, new features, patches, etc here first. Breaking something here loses you nothing and is easy to flush data directories and start over.
* Testing - run BTC / LND in "testnet" mode and "beta" test your software with a small group of vetted users. Test your code, backups, new features, patches, etc here **AFTER** they work on "simnet". Breaking something here loses you time, but not money, and your testers will help you discover bugs before they become problems.
* Production - run BTC / LND in "mainnet" - **AFTER** testing your code, backups, new features, patches, etc on **BOTH** "simnet' and "testnet" you may run your code on "mainnet" with real money.
Lightning is still in **beta** and some improvements are still in **alpha**. To limit exposure treat a lightning wallet like you would any "hot" wallet. Keep the wallet balance to a minimum to limit exposure. Investigate using [Lightning Loop]( to move your BTC from off-chain lightning channels to on-chain cold wallet and back again when a withdrawal is requested.
Complaining about getting wet when your ignored the warnings and sat in the "splash" zone is childish.
*"Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool… The mistake."* -Dr. Robert Ford (Westworld - HBO)
P.S. This is coming from someone who lost over 4.5 BTC betting on pig races in [BitVegas]( about 6 years ago. So yea...

Ratio doesn't matter.
1. Buy AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AFFORD. (~three months salary)
2. Wait until next halving
3. Sell at peaks and buy the dips
4. Sell a maximum of half your holding before the next halving
5. Repeat Step 2
Your portfolio should AT LEAST double in value after each halving so you never lose any dollar denominated net worth. ^_^

Correct, you should be fine. Most wallets, including hardware wallets, will automatically generate a new receiving address each time, but imagine you send someone a receiving address and they assume that it will always belong to you. They send you multiple payments over the course of a number of months. The first month you spend the amount received. After the first month's transfer you've lost your quantum shield. Now an adversary has a target for his hypothetical quantum computer. If the private key is successfully cracked then he'd examine your wallets history and wait until there are the most possible coins, then take them.
Like any question though, would it be profitable? How much would need to be stolen? How much would you make using the same power to mine?
I'd argue the emergence of a quantum miner would be similar to ASICBOOST or other mathematical advantages.

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT...

2010 - I attempted to start a bitcoin research, mining, and trading company. Took my business plan from bank to bank looking for $30-50k to get it started. At the time I was supporting myself programming as an independent contractor and I had a reasonable amount saved. Banks kept delaying approving my loan saying the needed more information. 6 months pass, then they started saying I needed more investors to back me before they'd be willing to do the same. None of my family or friends understood/believed in what I attempting to do. Took my idea to micro-lending sites and raised enough to "hopefully" jump through the banks hoops. After a year of giving me the run around they finally explain that...
THEY CANNOT LOAN MONEY TO A BUSINESS WHOSE MODEL WILL BE IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH THEIRS. Mind Blown.
2011 - So I say fuck it and throw everything I've saved, and borrowed, at it. Leverage myself another $30k in credit card debt. (~25% interest). Bitcoin was at $0.60 each.
2012 - At my peak I had over 10k Bitcoin and was mining over 3 per day using ATI 6950's and a hacked firmware that made them run like ATI 6970's, but I learned the hard way that DEBT is modern bloodletting and that market fluctuations can catch even the best of us with our pants down. DON'T TRADE ON MARGIN OR FUTURES. Not your keys, not your coins.
2013 - The fall of MtGOX was the final nail in my ventures coffin. My literal rock bottom. None of my coins were on the exchange, thank Satoshi, but my Atlas had shrugged. Sold most of my coins attempting to tread water. Went under like Artax in the Swamp of Sadness. -The Neverending Story (1984)
... depression, substance abuse, etc ...
2016 - Working minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. Found an old wallet.
2017 - Rode the wave up. Sold enough to ride out the downturn. Keeping absolute minimum balance in the bank and laughing at my incredibly low credit score. Quit my job. Working on starting a new venture.
2018 - Waiting for halving...
2019 - Waiting for halving...

We're already quantum resistant since the standard has already moved to Pay-To-Public-Hash. You'd have to reverse a one-way hash function, then crack ecdsa.

I believe you need to be a certain level of user to unlock ACH deposits. They also don't support micro-deposit ACH verification so your first deposit will probably have to be a Domestic Wire transfer. Take the time to learn how to wire money. Your local bank teller will do most of the heavy lifting. Once you know what you're doing you can even initiate them yourself from your online banking. In my experience Kraken responses extremely quickly to support cases so I'm not sure what you have to gain by complaining here. Unless you work for Coinbase's marketing team, in which case... \*slow clap\*
