Certainly hope so, man, I just bought 400 BTC and 300 ETH.

What are the risks involved in that process? That you try and exchange your free BCC back to BTC.

Thank you, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:53:39
I definitely will :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:40:18
Thanks will see if there's a small drop and then buy. I'm going to HODL anyways.

Thanks, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:47:35
Is it safe enough?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:46:49
Recommendations on a good wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:48:30
I feel the same way, joined about 4 weeks ago, started reading and studying as if my life depended on it and although I don't fully understand everything I hope I can contribute something back to the community someday, thanks guys for sharing the knowledge.

Meant 700 USD worth of BTC, sorry if it wasn't clear.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:30:24
Never heard of those, I will look into it, thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:28:44
Man, that was the best explanation I've ever heard, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:29:04
Meant 400 worth of BTC and 300 worth of ETH, lol, I wish I could buy that. My bad.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:07:33
I understand, but since many of us are "noobs" here, might as well take the time to explain if do you reply.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:29:44
No 400 USD on BTC and 300 USD on ETH. My bad, lol.

He's just playing the "I know it all"
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:07:19
When would that be, by november?
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:15:07
It is indeed, that's why I mostly read from other sources, but I come here to read for the sense of community too, and because there's a lot of well informed people here. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:20:26
Was looking for this!

My girl lives in Venezuela, which exchange site do you use to change BTC to BSF? I'm planning to send her some to help her.

Great piece of advice, gets hard to hodl sometimes but it'll be worth it in the longterm.
