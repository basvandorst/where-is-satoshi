You don’t deserve that license plate when one bitcoin is worth more than your car...
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:48:32
Trolling 101 lol

He’s highlighting the 52wk low. Up 60% in the last year 
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:38:45
Bitcoin doesn’t change the equation though. The same basic principles hold true 
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:53:12
Uh guys, I was told it would be worth $1M by now. Where do I collect my tendies?
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:32:02
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:01:40
Classic meaningless axes 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:18:42
That’s what they told me at $15k
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:11:01
It’s a movie, not a documentary...
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:55:36
Sell some of your bitcoin and buy a phone with a decent camera lol

The payday loan of BTC
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:37:26
So high tech /s
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:07:52
TLDR: speculators 
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:46:40
Don’t be an idiot and report back like you’re a hero...
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:16:01
Lost me at gold 
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:28:58
This is the kind of DD we need around here. People should take note. Well done OP 
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:26:42
Just a 6% flat fee? How generous 
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:26:10
That’s what the folks that bought in at $20k look like now 
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:34:30
Can you be more specific? What energy demands?
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:25:28
PSA: don’t be dumb, it makes life harder 
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:26:08
Everything impacts demand.. a little more specific?
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:29:35
There are already so many giftcard exchanges 
What makes yours different?
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:38:35
Bet they got really good at math though 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:02:34
Trolling? Or are you actually this stupid?
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:50:49
Putting up a go fund me now
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:04:14
What? That doesn’t even come close to making sense. $1k/day is significantly smaller than many individuals out there. I wouldn’t really call this a business yet 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:19:27
Self licking ice cream cone...
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:18:48
I’d rather be weak and rich than strong and poor /s
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:05:50
Why so little invested?
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:15:32
Still pretty sure you’re trolling. If not, feel free to leverage yourself on 20%+ debt. No currency swap is worth that kind of debt 
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:05:00
Lol wut?
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:07:34
But if your chart implications are correct, there is 10X upside with no risk? Seems like a no brainer. Draining the 401k now 
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:58:48
Karma whore 
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:00:47
That’s not investing, that’s speculating. But sure it’s possible to make money 
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:02:50
So you’re saying it would be stupid not to put my life savings in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-30 04:17:11
These are always so pointless 
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:52:08
Bitcoin isn’t backed by gold! /s
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:42:11
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:27:33
Why not $1M?? /s
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:01:16
More likely a Saudi oil meetup 
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:01:45
But gold isn’t pretending to be a currency? 
Can’t buy groceries with stocks or other asset classes either...
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:42:42
This guy liquidates 
@_date: 2018-07-12 02:38:10
Can’t even buy it with Bitcoin? Lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:56:13
Who still uses cards with foreign transaction fees?

Getting rich off past trends
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:21:12
Get that shoe ready 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:57:55
Oh please show us how. No freeloading off others paying said service provider either 
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:48:03
Also shorting Pied Piper 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:51:02
There is a 10% chance your IQ is 200 and a 90% chance your IQ is below 50. 
So from this scenario, we can expect your IQ to be 65, which is lower than the DMS-IV threshold of 70 for mild mental retardation. 
Math is fun!

AOL is still a company? Lol
