Sorry to hear that. Coinbase just had a pop up about wire transfer delays, so maybe it's affecting bank transfers, too. I wouldn't rely on money I have in crypto investments in the future if I were you.

Ohh, dude, I have so much to learn. That's good to know. Have they admitted as much?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:54:01
Or, you know, they dress up as bitcoins and f*ck.

Curious to see when the first bitcoin themed pornhub searches will start popping up.

I thought the same until I looked into their fees and limits. I know I'm in the minority, but coinbase allows credit cards and has higher limits, which made coinbase the obvious choice for me.

Oh. My. God. It's happening.

It doesn't matter what his vision was. As soon as there's money and banks involved, things like kyc (know your customer requirements for financial institutions) come into play. I work for a bank, and one thing you learn is that when the money is enough, big brother steps in. Bitcoin or no.
Sidenote, my brother bought his first crypto yesterday, and he set up his coinbase in 6 minutes, linked his credit card and bought some. Maybe it depends on a few factors how long it takes to get verified and purchase.

I see. I didn't know that. What do you think their hold up is?

I saw an article on investopedia that said coinbase has more users than charles schwab trading now. I'm not surprised that they're having technical issues with that kind of volume. Just hope they'll get more servers asap.

dude, what a straw man. I said it's a horrible currency to quote in. what does that have to do with investing on trading crypto?

I think we're losing track. the question is about daily volatility. the dollar has next to none. how can you believe quoting in btc is useful with those price swings?
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:08:05
let me know how that goes.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:36:41
inflation is a measure of average cost of goods
 an increase in supply isn't causative for valuation. it just means average wealth is increasing conceptually.

TCC ICO coming soon.
jokes aside, all that stuff is open source and should be straight forward to pick up. good move I'd say.

do a spell check. also, horrible opinion. measuring. value in btc is a disaster. it's not stable like the dollar.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:06:32
and if North Korea conquers the US, you'll have to get a bowl cut, but I don't see you rushing to the barber. so let's hold off on using btc as a unit until mass adoption, shall we?
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:39:03
are you really comparing inflation of 2% a year to price swings in excess of 70% in a matter of months? face it, btc is a horrible quote currency.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:05:36
did you read the article? literally his first example is about quoting your btc in btc not dollars. that has nothing to do with alt coins. the value of your btc exists in dollars. accept it.
