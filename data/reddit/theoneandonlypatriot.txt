So what you're saying is the secret is to have children and force them to work while you sleep? Genius!

I can almost guarantee you this woman knows the answer to the question, and that this was a setup for explanatory purposes. She gets paid big bucks to speak the mind of the layperson so that they can be corrected without feeling stupid.

I'm sorry but how can you know for a fact that it is a bubble? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:24:21
Also !remindme 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:26:17
People are constantly telling me it's going to bust, it's a bubble, yada yada. I'm not as convinced. I think people are forgetting that the price of a single Bitcoin is 19k, but that it's divisible. I don't really think we're in a bubble.

How do I set a remind me again? !remindme 10 years

Iota has no fees and gets faster with more transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:17:21
Be patient. Iota isn't a speculative coin. It's a low-mid risk mid-long term investment in a coin with an actual business plan. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:31:20
I kinda disagree. If it fails it will be because the technology is not that good and there are already far better alternative decentralized solutions.

Here's the grain of truth that is so difficult to comprehend because of the meteoric rise we've seen this year alone: this is only the very beginning of a historical revolution.

The 00.001 club 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:11:18
The fact that they have no idea what they're talking about should absolutely scream buy and hodl to everyone in here. Bitcoin will absolutely reach 100k, and until that point they will continue to have no fucking idea what they're talking about. 
Oh, and long Iota. Iota is the new bitcoin.

You're making bad straw man arguments. I never said it will increase indefinitely. I'm just saying it's entirely within the realm of possibility that we haven't reached the intrinsic value of Bitcoin. Also, the tulip analogy is terrible, because you can't transact tulips immediately anywhere in the world (like crypto can). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:28:19
So we beat him to death, right? That's the implication, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:08:17
The definition of a bubble is something trading far above its intrinsic value, and we have no idea whether that is true or not with Bitcoin. I'm not so sure it is.

Nah that dude was stupid for autoinflating the price of two pizzas to 10,000. He shoulda known better; that's stupid as hell. You're just being nice.

So, on a serious note, do we expect a pull back? People typically dump in light of events like this 
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:25:28
:( but I just walked through the door 
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:20:01
I don't even know who that is; can someone explain? I've seen the thread titles

Who pissed in your bitcoins this morning? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:55:49
Is it still worth buying Bitcoin at 3400$? I'm asking from the perspective of where we actually think the value of Bitcoin is headed. What reasons do we have to believe that Bitcoin is going to be increasing in value? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:23:29
Exactly, and with transaction times and fees being as bad as they are, do we really think Bitcoin will replace all fiats? I see it as a natural partner to fiats moreso than the ultimate one true currency 
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:58:35
More people need to understand this. It’s super funny to me how many people have recently taken to investing and clearly don’t know what long term actually means.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:55:44
More sweeping incorrect generalizations about millenials; lovely

You know what’s better than 10 cents? 0 cents 
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:57:19
They're entirely possible, I don't know what you're on about. Say for instance that they prevent people from converting from Bitcoin into USD through exchanges and especially banks? That'd be a pretty stifling regulation. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:43:00
His answer is the answer for why crypto currency is good. Yeah, deflation. However, that doesn't answer your question at all which is specifically about Bitcoin. The thing is that no one really knows if bitcoin will be the most important cryptocurrency. It's certainly the first but will it be the most important 20 years from now? Can't say for sure.

Buy high sell low; it's the Bitcoin way 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:17:33
BTC deserves a negative light sometimes.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:58:32
Yeah, I know that, but my coins will fluctuate so little in value that it would require giant swings in the full coins price for it to even be worthwhile. I buy 20 bucks worth, and bitcoin would have to go to 5600$ for me to get to 40$. That's why no one gives a shit about buying fractions of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:21:12
There just isn't enough guaranteed return, seems way too speculative right now especially considering bitcoin's price. I will check out alt coins though.
