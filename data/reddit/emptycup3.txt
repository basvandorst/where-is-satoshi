YEah, but communist with nice, shiney and expensive things. 
Buy apple computer: install Linux.

Really? You found android disapointing? Ive heard nothing but good about it. What specifically do you not like? Im pretty close to switching from my colonial era iphone4 to a new droid. . . I like to hear other's views on the os. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:12:53
Close, keep going guys.

Yep. As an apple customer (who runs linux on his machiene) I was quite surprised that they would do somthing so foolish in the first place.
Im still gonna try an android for my next moble device though.

This may be the winner here. Sir/Madme, may I ask what people pay for sweet tree goo in your locality?

@_date: 2014-06-03 22:02:08
it weights 2 kgs

Hmm,.. I could do maple syrup. How much do people pay for the syrup in your area?
If I could be competitive pricewise I may go this route.

Yeah, I 100% agree with this point. However the result of their change in policy seems to be 'opening up' BTC for many folks. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:24:21
I'd buy that for a ~~dollar~~ few bits.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:09:28
Ha! Im sure it would ship fine, I doubt you'd want to eat it when it arrived.
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:36:24
cool, thanks

Huh? That site smells a bit like freerange organic fresh-frozen scam.

Hi! 
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:24:05
This looks great, thanks! Any reason why you stopped using it? Also can international folk use it or just people in the US?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:59:45
Seriously though. Im getting dizzy, this is moving too fast. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:22:45


Thanks. Looks like lots stuff from Germany.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:59:32
Thanks. I had updated it a couple of weeks ago. . Should I update again?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:04:11
Ok, thanks for the info.
