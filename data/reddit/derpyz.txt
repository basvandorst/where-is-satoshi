Yes and I do too. Much easier on my eyes to read when having my coffee before work. I also think its more satisfying to read from newspapers and books rather than their online counterparts.

I would say more than 40,000 of those bitcoin are whales sitting on fat wallets but your point stands

What is depressing about that? It’s my personal preference. If you really find that depressing, maybe you’re the problem. No need for the cynical or negative thinking dude

And therefore illegal sellers will put the price right below the legal price. Why wouldn’t anyone buy the cheaper, regulated stuff? They would and drug dealers know this so they put their prices below. 
I’m not sure if you saw the comment I responded to because it’s not deleted, but the redditor said that drug dealers raise their prices to more expensive than the legally sold pot at dispensaries.

So you’re saying it’s depressing I read the news at all. And I know I can stay up to date by other mediums, my preference is a printed newspaper. 
Your original comment said that me reading my news out of a news paper is “depressing” which you still have failed to prove unless your argument that reading any news is depressing. My preference being different than yours doesn’t make it “depressing” so I’m going to assume you meant reading of any news is depressing. Which is completely irrelevant to my initial comment.

I told you in my previous comment
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:22:09
No you said it’s depressing that I read a physical paper. That’s not “depressing”. I never said anything about the material being depressing. The only way to avoid that is to not read the news at all online or print......? So yeah you’re the negative one for thinking it’s depressing I like to read my news out of a newspaper.
I read the news to stay up to date with the world wether what I’m reading is “depressing” or not rather than to make myself feel good.

There is economically no way that this makes sense. When restrictions on something are lifted (such as alcohol) the illegal supply becomes cheaper than the legal. Prices of illegal weed are driven by demand. Prices of legal weed are driven by demand, taxes, plus a premium due to the fact it is supposed to be the only way you can obtain it. This causes drug dealers to lower their prices to at least below the prices of legal supply

Why do people think that?

Nah, I think they want their lambos and private islands when it moons. Who gives a shit about international power when I can sit on my own beach drinking rum all day

He's right. Let's go even bigger. 100,000 in 2 months should do the trick.

And that’s the great debate isn’t it

Yes it does. 
If Bitcoin isn’t used as a currency it inherently has no value. If everyone has Bitcoin and just holds it and doesn’t buy things with it or sell or trade it, it has no REAL value.
