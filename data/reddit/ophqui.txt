*Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money or material goods*
Sounds a lot like what OP (and the rest of us) are doing
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:37:13
Just because you plan on that doesnt mean it will happen. There are plenty of time periods/areas where that would not have worked out for you
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:25:41
Of course both are gambling, with different stakes. Gold has been around for about 4000 years and traded/highly valued throughout, so the risk is smaller but so are the gains. To paraphrase buffett you are gambling that someone will be willing to buy it off you later

God this guy. The definition of overcomplicated, meaningless word salad. Dont care what he thinks

Lmao gambling is not the same thing as being idealistic
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:14:19
I've posted the definition above. This is a nonsense argument. OP is definitely gambling
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:25:54
My point was (many comments back) to point out that OPs actions arent 'idealistic' and arent to be applauded any more than taking your life savings and sticking them on a roulette wheel. Its pedants who have turned this into a dissection of what is and isnt gambling by talking about real estate and fuck knows what else.
Honestly this sub does more to discredit the crypto movement than any technical argument ever could. Its full of get rich quick children and morons

anyone know how to get access to bitcoin gold if you dont have an android device? seems like coinomi is the only option which seems a bit backward...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:57
That's called short selling. It causes crashes if you have serious amounts of alts, but you as a retail investor cant manipulate the market so dont worry about that. 
The fact is you dont know if its going up or down, so you are gambling. If you try to short sell and things go up you fuck yourself and then have to buy in higher. Its rarely worth the risk. Also remember selling into fiat is a taxable event in a lot of places, and you'll also pay whatever fees associated with the transactions
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:28:23
just to clarify, you DON'T think that its ridiculous that you can only get BTG if you have an android device? All the people who run IOS, mac and windows dont have access to their coins as there is no functioning wallet while the price fluctuates around all over the place?

"Over the last 2-3 years" will be when any serious, knowledgable investor stops listening. 2-3 years is fuck all, and it says nothing about what will happen over the next 20. People could be looking back and laughing at the whole idea of crypto, or bitcoin could be the Laserdisc/betamax of the crypto world, you would have no idea based on your analysis of the last 2-3 years. Your money is not safe, you are not definitely right

What fees on kraken for gbp-btc purchases?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:34:09
and all the spam transactions this weekend? those weren't malicious? If Bch is a solution, so is litecoin and every other coin that does exactly what bch does but better. Bch is just a shitcoin trading on the bitcoin name. 
If you really need e-cash, quick, cheap p2p transactions right now, get litecoin and stfu. The litecoin fans aren't spamming the mempool with no fee transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:14:25


as with all technical analysis though, it could be that, could be the opposite or anything in between. Agreed, don't invest what you cant afford to lose, but having read a couple of books on the subject it seems to be a load of shite. It only ever seems to work correctly in hindsight.

Firstly that's probably an attitude you'll want to change. If btc crashes the only sensible route is to buy more, panic selling will only lose you money really (and if the amounts that you are investing are right for you, you wont be worried about crashes). 
Second an exchange is an extremely tempting target for hackers etc. These are relatively small, relatively new companies who have shown themselves to have some tech issues (try and buy btc on coinbase when there is a crazy drop or rise and you'll see what i mean). Do you really trust them with your money long term? If you do, and you're new to this google Mt Gox and you'll change your mind.
Third, one of the major things about bitcoin is that it is decentralised. Theres no bank controlling your money, if theres a financial crash or something serious nobody can just turn the water off like what happened to the poor bastards in greece a couple of years ago. You are basically using coinbase as a bank if you leave your coin there, removing one of the biggest benefits of bitcoin

Shapeshift to btc then coinbase is easy

Great video. I wasnt sure where i stood on the bcash/core thing (ive hodl'd both, mostly through ignorance). This should be mandatory viewing for investors

My goal was paying off my mortgage with half of my btc holdings (my optimistic side thinks that will be achievable in the next 3-5 years). So even if btc hits 1mill or whatever afterwards i wont have 'pulled out early' because i'll have achieved what i set out to achieve. Try and think about a life goal that is sensible given what you are investing, write it down then hold till you get there, and have the conviction to sell when you do
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:24:32
Its not too challenging really, if i were you i'd get them off coinbase. At least download electrum or breadwallet or something (both easy to use software wallets, one for computer, one for iphone). If you have more than 1-2 btc then a hardware wallet like trezor is a sensible idea. Coinbase have already said they will support both chains, but its still a good idea to own your own btc. Soooo many hackers will try their luck with coinbase with the prices like this
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:55:25
You been to settings, advanced and looked to see if its there? People who had bch from the fork it just appeared in there and you can send it out. Generally sending bch to a btc address and vice versa is fucksville though unfortunately. There are services you can pay for that can help you but unless its a fucking lot of bch its not going to be worth it
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:11:37
Sold half...not sure if the top is still to come or if it was a few hours ago? (I didnt buy, i already owned, and i traded for eth which is at least stable).
If i accurately called the top that was my first ever trade where i didnt get burned, so basically its going to moon in the next few days
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:22:46
Like any investment, i would think about defining 'long term gain' rather than sticking an arbitrary date on it. What do you want your 500 to turn into? What if you got there in 6 months? Or what if yu are not there in 2 years? Do you give up and cash in or hodl some more?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:11:24
Dont go all in. When the market goes down if you have everything to lose you will panic sell. Even if you think you wont. Invest what you can afford to lose and you can comfortably watch the market go up, down and sideways until whatever your investment goals are met (remember to set investment goals)
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:51:24
Get a wallet of some description pls, coinbase is not the place to store over £1500 or whatever it is
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:43:01
Lol i think when it hits 10k there will be some lovely sell walls and maybe a bit of a discount afterwards. Ive got some fiat waiting
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:58:20
Very possible. The good news stories of btc hitting 10k might attract even more irrational exuberance than we have already. I'm not buying an ath though 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:17:23
Umm depends on your investment goals, im in for the long haul so a bit of a dip isnt really going to affect me i dont think
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:16:15
Dont do anything stupid dude, talk to your loved ones about your loss, get some professional help if needs be. Losing that much money is fucking horrible, and having someone steal it is worse, but your life is worth more than 6 btc
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:25:49
any in particular that are worth investing and holding? Or any resources to start learning about different altcoins? So far i only really have the main players (monero,eth,litecoin) but i understand there are hundreds that are doing interesting things. I'm not really a tech guy so im mostly looking at them as an investment (or a gamble)
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:00:11
Yeah im thinking more stock market collapse (pretty much everything is at an all time high, lots of loose money being thrown around in silicon valley, everyone and his mum opening a "start-up" - not sustainable in the long term) rather than an individual currency issue
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:45:54
Such as? Which are the best altcoins? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:48:01
Can someone explain what is better about a hardware wallet as opposed to breadwallet for iphone? I have a relatively small amount but definitely not one im comfortable losing. Seems relatively secure, i'd probably have significantly more chance of losing a trezor to be honest...
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:09:20
hey can you expand on this a bit more please? I have some funds in bread, would they be safer if i moved to electrum now? i also have an electrum wallet. I opened a thread on r/bitcoinbeginners about this very topic and was told that bread was safe as long as i wasnt moving stuff around too close to the fork. Incorrect advice?
