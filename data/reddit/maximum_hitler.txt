There is no magical force that moves the market, but there is also no magical force that allows you to determine what _does_ move the market by looking at purely historical data. It's nonsensical. 
Could you maybe reliably predict what the market will do? Sure. Can you do that purely by drawing lines on a historical chart??? NO, BECAUSE YOU LACK ENOUGH MEANINGFUL DATA!
You ever wonder why when you go to trade stocks they have in BIG BOLD LETTERS **Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results**?
I guarantee you that if you looked at a series of stock charts from right before large corrections, you could draw a chart that looked EXACTLY like this from every one of them if you picked a point early enough.

Physics is at least an extremely predictable and consistent phenomena that you can model almost exactly the same way every time. There isn't some magical formula that makes the market behave rationally or even consistently, and if you think the markets are in any way like physics I have a portfolio with consistent 11% returns to sell you...
Here's the reality: based on the data alone there's a 50% chance the price goes up and a 50% chance the price goes down.
Throw in some market sentiment analysis if you want to predict the price more accurately, but looking at historical data alone doesn't prove _anything_ except that you're a goofball for believing in this crystal ball nonsense.

These graphs read like the financial equivalent of Astrology and Horoscopes. Maybe we should be consulting tea leaves and reading auras to see where Bitcoin goes next!
Amazing anybody takes this seriously.
