They prohibited the use of Bitcoin simply because they are sick control freaks, obsessed with telling people how to live their lives and terrified of anyone who isn't willing to obey.
Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador have been following the [Cuban blueprint for communist dictatorship](  for about a decade now (Venezuela being the most advanced in its implementation at this time). This blueprint for human predation is much more severe than the predation systems in other nations.
Given this scenario, any form of money that allows the regular people to maintain ultimate control over their wealth obviously throws a huuuge wrench in their machinery of human control and predation.
They ban cryptocurrency because they understand it, where understanding it means getting the enormity of the threat to their control.
For the record: Lawsky is doing the exact same thing -- just in a less honest, more sophisticated and insidious way, where you can have "permission" but only if you are absurdly rich already, and unscrupulous enough to rat your customers out.

Look, buddy, you can believe whatever you want, and I am not going to force you to believe otherwise.
But if you want to have a dialogue with me (which I infer from you addressing me), and your contention is that one of my ideas is incorrect. *you're going to have* to show me *how* my ideas are incorrect.
Just calling them "disingenuous" or "bad" doesn't cut the mustard.  Making vague allegations of dubious validity  with weasel words (like "basically zero") doesn't counteract my contentions either. I mean, take for example your reductionist "it's all reality" retort, surely you see how you misrepresent the *causal* distinction between death by bullet and death by hunger -- do I really need to explain it any more, or do you admit that you see the difference too and you deliberately confused the issue here?
Here is the minimum bar of civility you must meet: You need to take my contention you dispute and actually prove it wrong by showing the premises to be false or the conclusion not to follow logically.  Simple enough.  So far you haven't done that.  Why?  What are you running away from?
Alternatively, you can, y'know, *not* have a dialogue with me.  But don't give me these non-answers.  You only hurt your position that way.  Seriously, if your belief system requires you to insist that *you not having food cos you don't work cos work is slavery maaaan* is "basically" (see what I did there?) the same thing as *someone shooting you in the head*, not only are you going to sound absurd here -- you are going to have a *bad time winning at life*.

Of course not, not right away.  First they become a monarchy, and then, after countless dead in a pointless revolution, then they become a democracy, where they are just as much serfs as they were before,  it with much more complicated rituals to obscure the serfdom.


So your choice is really what kind of ruin you prefer: an imaginary one of a "protection" agency killing you for not paying them, or the real one of your owners throwing you into a cage for not paying them, where you will rot for years, be raped, and possibly murdered too.
That is an interesting double standard where you minimize what already happens but trash-talk an idea worth trying (maybe not to you, but definitely to others).


You wish.
If you don't pay *and you don't resist* them when they come to get you with guns, maybe they won't "accidentally" shoot you.  Maybe they will just bruise you.  Then they put you in a cage, at which point *it is the other people in the cage* who may very well murder you (possibly dicking you first, for that added extra dehumanizing humiliation).  So basically your owners just outsource the killing to people that your owners previously harmed to the point of dehumanization first.
And of course if you put up any effective resistance, your owners will execute you on the spot and then blame you for that.
Do you deny any of this?  Would you like video evidence?  Would you deny that too?

If, however, you visited  (perhaps because you happen to be masochistic), then the exit node is the node that relays your traffic to outlook.com, and, consequently, it's the only node that can be identified as transmitting unencrypted data that may, under our absurd and corrupted legislation, cause trouble to the person running the exit node.

My contention is that you *should* care, because:
* Should these apps become the *norm* among Bitcoin users, your future and more innovative apps will not be allowed to interoperate with these apps, except at the most basic send / receive functions.
* HTML5 apps will never be able to provide the advanced features of cryptocurrencies that are being worked on.  In particular, technical limitations force this state of affairs: all HTML5 apps require centralized backend servers, they are not allowed to connect over any transport other than HTTP, and they will not support data push.
Basic Bitcoin wallets on iOS?  Sure, so long as the app developers snitch on you behind your back.  But what about privacy-preserving wallets?  Not allowed.  CoinJoin wallets?  Nope.  Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency (decentralized) marketplaces?  Not happening.

Perhaps it is a waste of money for you to buy a new $300 computer in order to protect, say, 450 Bitcoin.  That is a nice opinion.  So is the opinion that 2 factor author is useless, and the opinion that a $5 padlock will protect a gold ingot.
It's really up to you -- your money on the line.  Just don't disinform others by lulling them into a false sense of security.  Used computers can and some do contain persistent malware.  Telling people to use them to protect potentially millions of dollars is at the very least irresponsible.


I am sorry you feel sad for computer security researchers who have written and discovered malware that does stuff much more complicated than what you wrote about.
For example: you seem to feel bad about security researchers that discovered exfiltration of data in offline computers via ultrasound and USB disk firmware.
That's okay. They don't really care about your feelings.


Before you give your opinion on computer security, I advise to study up on what's going on in computer security.  For example: that which you just said "may not even exist" -- BIOS keylogger -- there is a video of it on YouTube, right in front of a live audience, working against Windows and Linux.
You wouldn't give your self-styled opinion on the risks of bariatric surgery or neurosurgery.  Apply the same principle to the field of computer security: just because you know how to operate a mouse, doesn't mean you understand the security risks involved in using a computer.  Oh, for the record: we know you don't know about the topic because the "only" methods you mention to subvert offline computers, are not in the slightest the *only* methods to subvert computers.

Imagine for a second that I have been feeling bad for months, even as I have been dutifully obeying my homeopath's orders.
After months of pain, I finally go to the (actual, medical) doctor.  The doctor runs some tests and every test comes back positive for stage 4 metastatic lung cancer. He tells me very sternly "hey, Mr. audiodad, I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you have 3 weeks to live, you should make arrangements for when you are no longer here".
Do you think I accomplish *anything* positive by yelling at the doctor "So what's your genius idea to fix it?"
No. Right? The fact that the doctor can't cure the cancer doesn't make the cancer go away. Getting angry at the doctor doesn't cure the cancer.  Doubling down on the homeopathic "treatments" doesn't cure the cancer.

No, you just implied it.  What you mean when you say "compromise" is "submit to the non-negotiable orders you're given, or they'll fuck you up, and that's good".  That's *not compromise* in any way, shape or form -- that's *obedience* and *surrender* prompted by threats against me, my family, and our well-being.
Here's what compromise looks like.  Say we were discussing what car to buy and I decide to buy a Corvette from last year, because I can't afford a Tesla Model S without going into debt.  *That* is true compromise.   I have compromised on what I really wanted, *not because of threats for disobedience, but because of strictly personal and family circumstances*.
I have no problem negotiating with others on the basis of win-win and mutual benefit.  I have absolutely no problem compromising when the counterparty is also willing to compromise as well.
But this bullshit of people giving me unilateral orders, willing to terrorize me for disobeying, and never ever compromising themselves, only to cause me to surrender to the orders as "compromise", and (even worse) as something virtuous that adults must do -- I assure you, passing this off as "compromise" is just not going to work on me.  You will not succeed in gaslighting me that way.  I don't appreciate you telling me that I must obey and that my obedience is compromise.

Let's not forget that Mt. Gox was *already regulated* (remember how they were doing *all the compliance work* that delayed withdrawals and destroyed Gox customers' anonymity? did you think they did that *for sport*?) **and it still failed**.
Let's not forget that Mt. Gox only started declining cash withdrawals *after the regulators stole* **six million dollars** of their customers' money that was in a U.S. bank account.
And yes, let's not forget that, as OP noted, the same "regulators" that are trying to sabotage Bitcoin businesses and technology, their very work was predicated on the need to prevent financial catastrophes like 2008, *but they did not*.  **None of those mother fuckers have their noses clean.**  That they are hypocritically attempting to impose on us all, to dictate that we must ask for permission to do stuff with Bitcoin, *even to inject back doors in our software* (did you read the proposal?), is **an outrage**.  
These three points somehow always and perpetually escape the intellects of the "pro-regulation" useful schmucks.  You know, the crowd of mouthbreathers that say "if only we had *one more law*, then the world would be perfect!"; because the problem, you see, is that the country that has *the largest amount of laws and caged people*, of any and all countris, in all the history of Mankind, *the problem* is that said country "*lacks laws*".
Anyone demanding that Bitcoin businesses ask for a very expensive permission to continue working, and thinking this is going to protect people, is an imbecile.  Anyone demanding that Bitcoin businesses add to their computers whatever computer code the government wants to add, and thinking this is going to protect people, is an imbecile.  Anyone thinking that the way to solve problems is to *threaten or cage more people*, is an imbecile.  If you are an imbecile, do us all a favor *and shut the fuck up*.

* Nazi Germany: murderers were government employees.
* Julius Caesar: emperor of a government, murders carried out by his employees
* Mongol empire: says so right there in the title; the murderers were part of an empire, which implies a government
* War of 100 years: Plantagenet vs. Valois, both rulers who presided over their respective governments (specifically, monarchies)

That's a nice narrative, except it's 100% wrong and -- worse -- corrupt because the narrative *supports the thieves*.
This isn't at all a lost and found where you go and claim stuff that belongs to you.  If you had money there, you were *robbed*.  And now the thieves are selling off your stuff to pay themselves and other thieves their salary.  What happened in reality:
The coins were *stolen* by *force* from DPR.  His laptop was *snatched* by one of the thieves that stole the coins, and then he was *kidnapped* and taken to a cage.  Subsequently, the thieves *violated* the security of his Web site and *stole* the coins from there as well.

Unlike Bitcoin, however, they also carry a counterparty risk, because they are IOUs as opposed to actual money.
Also, TIPS track the *official* inflation rate.  That number is probably one of the most dishonest stats published out there -- for *everything* that you could and would like to actually spend your money into, your fiat money is losing value faster than the number would say.
If you want to protect yourself against "inflation", go buy TIPS -- maybe the counterparty risk is acceptable to you, maybe you don't mind being lied to about how well they protect you against inflation.

The dynamics of what is going on are very interesting. It appears that the president there -- effectively a dictator -- is angry at the fact that the Ecuadorian economy is entirely run with dollars.
From what I have read, it has been his plan for decades to "restore sovereignty" by outlawing the dollar and starting a new currency, but until today, there were many political reasons why his plan couldn't succeed.
This legislative move is a double whammy to begin the termination of the dollar (like Bolivia and Venezuela, and more recently Argentina, have done) *and* to stop any competition to their new money *right on its tracks*.  
Remember that part of the system of predation is precisely about *stopping competition*, so that the people in control of the monopoly can *enrich themselves faster*.  When people understand the implication of saving in Bitcoin instead of Bolivares or Sucres, they almost always choose Bitcoin for its non-inflationary guarantee, which puts the kibosh on any plan to start a new inflationary currency.
This is doubly true with Latin American peoples and their history of enduring involuntary poverty via inflation (see Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil).  So Bitcoin is something that Ecuador's dictator can *never* allow his peasants to have.  And predictably so, they have banned it, like they banned it in Bolivia, and hobbled it in Argentina.
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who wins and who loses with Bitcoin's increasing popularity.  Just a bit of understanding of how the world really works.

Internet attacks can be fended off effectively these days.  Bitcoin network attacks cost money.  That is the whole point of transaction fees.


Any attack of those sorts causes a drop in price which then recovers after a while.  So no permanent "inflation", just a temporary fluctuation.

Thank you!  For the record, you do not need to use a physical USB device to use LUKS.  A big file in one of your disks or Dropbox folders can be a LUKS container, it just needs to be luksOpen'ed and then the resulting /dev/mapper device can be formatted / mounted / unmounted / luksClose'd as if  it was a block device.
The big benefit of using a LUKS container file is that you get to store multiple files within it, at your discretion, with whatever file system you want (FAT, ext4).  If you only need to store a bunch of files that need to be secure, a KeepAssX encrypted file  with 10 million rounds (see the settings) is probably enough to  be placed into Dropbox, especially if you are willing to go to the trouble of typing the password and extracting whatever attachments you want from within the KeepAssX program into a RAM disk like /dev/shm (usually is mounted as a RAM disk -- never write the unencrypted files to normal non-RAM disk, see for more info).

You are supporting people who would do that.  If there is any decency in you, you will change your mind.

Let me repeat the two main ideas in my post, which you ignored:
 already could operate in the same space, with drastically fewer regulations, before this proposal.
 new regulations don't make it easier to operate with Bitcoin -- they make it harder.


  This proposal makes it illegal for New Yorkers to use Bitstamp and any other exchange that does not obey the proposal.  It does not matter where Bitstamp is, if they server New Yorkers, the U.S. government will attempt to fuck them up anyway -- because their theory of jurisdiction, which they used against Liberty Reserve, doesn't limit them to suing people in the U.S.

These people are smart enough to cause 99% obedience, and the death or caging of the other 1%.
Remember: you are speaking of the intelligence of people who got 300 million people to call green papers "money" and to call precious metals "funny money". Do you think *stupid people* can accomplish that?
Do not underestimate how diabolically intelligent your rulers are.  Protip: their intelligence, combined with their abysmal lack of scruples, is why they rule you, and you don't rule them.


Except that is exactly what they do pretty much all the time -- their racket wouldn't work if their victims didn't feel that without the racket they would be much worse off.


Nah. Sure, ultimately everyone obeys because disobedience and resistance usually mean bullet in head.  But their resorting to guns is relatively rare compared to how often the racketeers resort to deception, and the guns are only used against those on whom the manipulation tactics don't work.
Remember: the more they need to use the guns, the less control they actually have.

No.  I *added* to the post.  posted a picture showing exactly that.


The problem with claiming that what I am doing here is "wildly dishonest", is that such a claim has exactly zero basis in any meaningful definition of honesty.  I did not change my position, change the meaning of my post, or engage in any other changes with the intention or the goal to deceive anyone.  I *never* have done that, and I dare you to find *one* instance of me doing it.
At best, all you'll find is me going back to my earlier posts and backfilling evidence for my claims, or adding new content, or rephrasing what I've said to be more accurate.  Does this make the people replying with idiocies to my posts look foolish?  Probably -- I bet idiots who deny something I have said must feel utterly retarded, when a link in my post appears that proves they are wrong.  Is this dishonest?  In what universe is telling *more* of the truth "dishonesty"?
Besides, I don't know what is it about my groupies that tend to believe everything I say must be a "debate".
In the post in question, I'm *agreeing* with OP, and adding to what he is saying.  There are a grand total of *zero* differences of opinion between me and OP.
If anyone here has a beef with what others have said (and an obsession with seeing every person's claims as  it's you and my other groupie.  And, while you clearly care about me, I don't really give a shit for you two.  So there.  Go debate yourself.

Funny you should mention Google as monopolist.  Google having been early (they were not), or rich (they were not), has *nothing* to do with this.  There were *many* other search engines that came to be *earlier* than Google, and I used them all.  Google started broke-ass when they began offering search, too.
The false causes you cite has nothing to do with the state of monopoly you complain about.  I will now show you the *actual reason* why Google enjoys a monopoly:
[There you go, here's *the* document](  What is it?  A patent.  Who enforces it?  The government.  What happens to the people who compete with Google?  The government -- not Google! -- throws them in a cage or ruins them.
So, by simple, elementary deduction, that monopoly you accuse Google of is actually solely created, caused, and perpetuated by *the government*.
In a sense, when you talk about the Internet, you're proving what I said initially: that monopolies can only last long *when government force is what imposes the monopolies to begin with*.  And this is true not just in the case of Google, but also in the case of Facebook, WhatsApp, Motorola, Amazon, eBay... you name a company, they have a *government-granted* monopoly on *something*.
Pretty much the only place where you don't see monopolies that are enforced by government is in *open source products*.  You've probably noticed that open source developers have no time or inclination to be suing each other, or to file patents such that they can prohibit other open source developers from developing an alternative app.  You can now probably make an educated guess as to why so many open source developers are *against patents*.

There are good reasons to want a separate computer to protect your money.
For example, there are disk firmware, SMM and BIOS trojans that will persist even across full wipes, OS reinstalls, and BIOS reflashes.  Case in point: the NSA (as I am sure others too) has deployed their "persistent implants" on more than a million machines, and their goal is to continue increasing this.
However, for these reasons, it is pointless to buy a computer that has been used before, like the one OP posted.

We can't do anything to change anything.
There is a reason the draft says what it says -- barring a few cosmetic changes, this is almost exactly what will become law, because the intention of the "regulators" all along was to sabotage any business that threatens *their customers' interests* (banks' interests) and to co-opt any business that can be coerced into obedience.
Accordingly, you can expect whatever suggestions you make to go to the trashcan.  After all, if you don't do what they say, they can put you in prison, but if they don't do what you say, nothing will happen to them.

People have already shown you how he benefited the criminals of 2008 in the past.  People have already shown you how his current behavior benefits the criminals of 2008. People have shown you how his latest proposal makes most Bitcoin businesses illegal as they are today.  Clearly none of this was enough to change your mind.  So tell me: **what evidence could anyone give you that would persuade you otherwise?**

You think you can pricklishly come here  and insinuate that I am lying, trying to make me look bad and dishonest?  You get nothing. You play by the rules, you establish a *true dialogue* with me?  You may get some learning. 
Having established how this goes, and explained that your animosity gets you nothing, here is how this is going to go:
1. You answer my question *first*, and *then* I post a video proving the specific point, like I earlier offered *conditional* to answering my question.  Then we discuss it.

2. Anyone else *not you* is **free** to contact me via private message, asking for video proof via either PM or a separate Reddit post, and I will happily oblige.  You will *not* get that link.

I can argue for the abolition or the modification of at least quite a few "motor vehicle safety regulations".
I have a *brilliant* idea.  Let's write a new regulation that will absolutely guarantee *safe driving* by mandating installation of a huge spike on the steering wheels of cars, aimed straight at the driver's chest; this will keep everybody ultra careful when they're driving.  Of course, like with any other law, anyone found in disobedience to this will be fined.  If they resist the fine, armed men will hunt them down and drag him into a cage.  If they resist being dragged into a cage, [these armed men will use any means to either obtain their full obedience or their death](
OK, now substitute the words "huge spike on the steering wheels" with "sturdy belts on the seats".  Did the above paragraph become less preposterous?  Absolutely, no questions, we agree on that.  *But... did the rest of the idea suddenly become virtuous as opposed to barbaric?*

 Everyone working on these tools you refer to (especially if providing them as a service), regardless of your geographical location or nationality, will necessarily be in breach of the "BitLicense" orders, and is in danger of being arrested or extradited.

So, to reuse your own words, you just want to be part of a Mafia that *doesn't call itself a Mafia*.  You understand how "efficacious" it is (for the Mafiosi and their henchmen, of course) to make up rules for other people, and then to brutalize or ruin whoever doesn't comply with those made-up rules.  And, therefore, you want to be part of an organization that uses these exact methods.  You just don't want the *social stigma* of behaving that way.  So that's why the organization you join must *not* be callled a "Mafia".

Letting people transact privately and without interference **is** a "politically extreme view" these days. 
Most people today firmly believe that "good" and "justice" are made when Godvernment prowls between any two transaction parties, siphons off a percentage of the transaction, and terrorizes anyone who resists.

Not really.  We live in the exact same reality: if I was next to you, I could walk up to you, poke you gently on the chest with my finger, and you would feel that in your chest.
Here's what's different between you and me (far simpler than your multi-reality hypothesis):
- You perceive reality through schizophrenic goggles that make you think the "regulators" are your protectors.
- I see what these crooks do, I contrast their actions with their claims, I see that they lie and deceive, and I conclude they are the very people facilitating all the corruption you fear.
What you call "mainstream" is simply a name for a mishmash of insane and contradictory cultural norms and beliefs (one of which is your Stockholm Syndrome hypothesis that people with the power to cage *you* for disobedience, somehow are the people protecting you from "evil").  "Mainstream" is literally nothing beyond your distorted perception, combined with a rather self-important smugness that makes you feel better / vindicated / superior / calm, solely because the nonsense you believe is also believed by most people around you.  It's no different from Christians who feel they are "more moral" than others, solely because their religion is the most popular.
Except your cultural goggles don't actually make you superior, righteous, or correct -- they only make you blind and a target for predation by the very people you perceive as your "protectors".

Not at all.  It actually *proves the point*.
One of the *clearest* ways we can tell how brilliant these people (who do business as "government") are, is that they have managed to *subvert the minds and volitions* of pretty much *everyone around you*.  They have corrupted people's minds to such an extent, that if you disobey *or even criticize* the government or its dogmas, everyone around you will turn against you and attack you, sometimes brutally violently.
That is diabolically brilliant.
It necessitates levels of **emotional** and **verbal** intelligence you can't even grasp, robust enough to resist the continued blowbacks from the truth, while at the same time resilient enough to operate *tacitly* across a large group of racketeers and dupes, even with them fucking up their part of the play constantly.
And it's *almost* (but not quite) fucking magical, because the outcome is the product of strictly emergent behavior, acted by intelligent actors, who need not be aware of everything to operate -- they need only know of their own little slice of the racket, and how to manipulate the victims directly connected to it.
You can't organize such a Machiavellian, wide-ranging, resoundingly successful racket.  *But they can, and they did*.


It does not?  What's your theory then?  That people are *born* thinking that politicians are angels, cops are saviors, bureaucrats are saints, and green rectangles are money?  I look forward to your genetic tests proving this is a trait one is born with, as opposed to behaviors young people learn in *mandatory government institutions*, under pain of being punished.

If speaking the truth in plain English of people doing things (a fabulous phrase I learned from a now-gone redditor) was commonplace, then perhaps people wouldn't roll their eyes when they hear the truth.
If the only thing stopping you from speaking your mind is *fear* that others may roll their eyes at what you say, then you're fundamentally a slave of other people's opinions. I could understand remaining mum when the consequence could be death or bankruptcy (great reasons not to talk to cops, by the way), but in our modern world you have absolutely nothing to fear about sharing with the people who supposedly love you.

You don't have anyone in prison?  Did they walk themselves into prison of their own free will?  No, right?  They were dragged there, using force.

You don't? You never sang a chant pledging "allegiance" (obedience) to it and a piece of cloth?  You don't do everything they tell you?  You don't consider your ~~Holy Books~~laws sacrosanct, or call people disobedient of them ~~sinners~~criminals?  You don't revere and show deference to men in black dresses or blue costumes, who could kill you if you resist them? You don't call dead politicians "founding fathers" (family elements are prevalent in all cults)? You didn't forcibly go for 12 years to an institution where they would punish you if you didn't repeat everything you were told in "civics" class?  You don't reflexively distort reality in the ways they tell you to distort it?  Like, it's not mass murder but "war", not theft but "seizing", not extortion but "taxes", not kidnappings but "arrests"... You don't find yourself doing anything like this?
You do all those things, I guarantee it, I have already seen you do several in fact. But sure, since 95% of the people do it, you don't see it as worship -- you see it as normal, exactly as normal like a Catholic would see Catholicism in a nation where 99% are Catholics.
I understand seeing what you really believe is disgusting, but you tell me: what other word *not* "worship" can you possibly use to describe your behavior, *and* remain honest to your own observed behavior? **It's a god damn cult** you're defending, and you know it.

Excellent question.  The answer is precisely the feature of being *human* that distinguishes us from other animals: *you improve yourself* such that what you do provides value that others want.
For example, say I have no skill whatsoever that anyone is willing to pay me for -- my next step ought to be learning a skill.  This can be as part of an apprenticeship, a school of trade, a college, or simply by doing.


Most people who have a disability can in fact, and usually do, provide value to others -- industriousness and ingenuity is not limited to able-bodied people.
In the relatively rare case that you are most conclusively (not unwilling but) *unable* to improve yourself such that you can provide value to others, reality dictates that the only nonaggressive solution to your woes is that you must beg.
Begging sucks big time.  Humans (being the empathetic species that we are) have realized it sucks *so much* that there are lots of people conforming plenty of organizations dedicated to the nonaggressive and voluntary help of people who can't provide that value.  We call those organizations "charities".


That sounds pretty bad.  Tell you what -- I'll give you *four* alternatives that explain what *I* would do, and (in line with my I respect for your capacity to devise solutions to human problems) I'll let you come up with more:
1. You can move to another place.  Moving often makes you grow as a person.
2. You can attempt to persuade the terrible person to change his ways.  Developing the skills of empathy and conflict resolution counts as improving yourself.
3. You can start your own business.  Going solo is guaranteed to improve yourself by learning many new things.
4. You can learn another profession and abandon your current line of work.  Learning a new profession is all about improving yourself and furthering your horizons.
How many other answers can you conceive to that predicament?


Though I do not know what you signify when you use the word "capitalism", I think what you are saying here is correct.  Paraphrasing to see if I understood it correctly: in a particular system ("capitalism") where the only legitimate ways to acquire value are (a) to make it yourself or (b) to trade it with someone else, nobody forces you to (b) trade it with someone else.


Maybe for you that's the case, and I can certainly understand, as it would not be viable for me either.  But a sizable minority of people disagree with you, and beg for a living, and they live.  Clearly, begging is a *valid* and *nonaggressive* way to live a life, not without its disadvantages, but it's just as valid and legitimate as my job and your job.  So let's just withhold generalizations and judgments that denigrate a group of people, shall we?


Not really.  Like you yourself said, if you don't want to exchange value with X, you *don't* have to.  Like I showed you a few inches above this sentence, there's tons of options under the taxonomy of "work" that don't involve directly renting your time to anyone.
Here's the blunt truth: *nothing* about *capitalism* requires you do to *anything*.  *It is reality* that requires you to eat, to shit, to sleep, and to do *some activity* to fulfill those needs.  If you are a "slave" to anything -- and I mean "slave" in the most metaphorical of senses here -- *you are a slave to your body and to entropy*.  But the laws of Nature have *nothing* to do with *capitalism* in this context -- under *any* economic system, it is still true that you still have to eat, you still have to shit, you still have to sleep, and you *cannot* get something for nothing, no matter how seductive that illusion might be.
To be frank, and I don't mean any offense here, the direction you're going is starting to sound like the old-in-the-tooth "I have to eat, and nobody wants to give me food for nothing, damn you capitalism, you're to blame" rant.  If that's the angle you want to pursue, please do let me know in advance so I can stop -- there's a lifetime limit to how many of these rants I can field, and I reached it years ago.

This is correct, much like the War on ~~Drugs~~People only captures about 1% of all merchandise.  A failure like every other Godvernment failure.
Unfortunately, their attempts at ruining people by enforcing the new "regulations" is really only a tiny part of the problem.  Here are three larger problems with these "regulations":
1. **The extremely destructive economic effect.**  The vast majority of people (a) are not rich (b) at least make a half-hearted attempt to obey the law.  Since the new "regulations" punish people who engage  in a Bitcoin business without permission, and since getting permission after the "regulations" requires millions of dollars, the great majority of these people *won't be innovating with Bitcoin*. Which has a destructive effect on the ecosystem.
2. **The extremely toxic social effect.**  Today, there exist fantastic privacy-protecting and commerce-enhancing tools like Mycelium Wallet and Dark Wallet.  Today, it's perfectly socially acceptable to use them.  But once the "regulations" make it illegal to use these tools, the *social perception* of people who use and develop these tools will change from "innovators" who are advancing Bitcoin to "scofflaws" that must be punished.  Because snitching can be profitable, now users and developers of these tools must stay underground and stop sharing the tools with others.  So the great majority of the people won't be using innovative Bitcoin tools.  Which has a destructive effect on the ecosystem.
3. **The international sabotage of Bitcoin businesses.**  The U.S. is almost unique among nations in that its rulers take an "expansive" view of jurisdiction -- id est, no matter where you were born, and no matter where you live, if they think you're disobeying them, they will have you kidnapped from abroad into the U.S., and they have no problem extorting authorities from other places into forcing you to "come".  If you run an exchange-like business not established in New York, like BitInstant, and you fail to ban people from New York or pay up the $$$ and obey the ridiculous impositions, you too could join the ranks of the next Liberty Reserve CEO, in prison and completely ruined, for good.  This forces businesses to either stop serving NY people, or to reduce themselves to a minimum common denominator of absolutely zero privacy.  Which has a destructive effect on the ecosystem.
Were these effects "accidents"?
I am thoroughly convinced that the "regulators" **deliberately wanted to create these three categories of sabotage, so that Bitcoin would never again be used to its full potential**.  They don't want people anonymously transacting.  They don't want people setting up competing businesses.  They don't want people giving their business to international players.  Given that people who engage in those activities are exactly the people being targeted for attack by the "regulations", I find it hard to think that highly intelligent (and corrupt) people behind the "regulations" could somehow have *accidentally missed* these consequences.  **They are no accident.  Their stated intentions don't matter -- what matters is only the effect of their behavior**
All of this leads me to conclude that **the new proposed "regulations" are strictly and exclusively the result of "regulators" acting to deliberately destroy and / or undermine Bitcoin.**  When, in the future, people look at you like you're a sicko / a pederast / a criminal, because you told them that you use Mycelium or Dark Wallet... when people rant about how sad it is that New York has so very few and gargantuan Bitcoin "businesses" (read: only banks)... when friends (like, say, Erik Voorhees) are extradited for foreign exchanges lacking "permission" from the World Police, and staazis bark "well, he had it coming, he didn't obey the regulations"... I hope you guys remember to dust off the bookmark you made of this comment, and reread it once again.
So bear this in mind when you try to grovel to "Supernintendo" Lawsky -- he absolutely does not have your best interests in mind, so  all your reasons and your passion won't matter for shit.  The only choice you have, is the choice to disobey like the longboarders in the video, and to do so smartly so you're never caught by the people who want to ruin you.

That subtle distortion of the topic?  I noticed it.  We were discussing *counterparty risk*, you changed the subject to *risk class*.  This is dishonest.  If your opinion requires dishonesty to defend it, both you and your opinion necessarily suck.
I do agree that Bitcoin and TIPS they are not in the same risk class at all.  Owning bitcoins exposes you to mathematically zero counterparty risk.  Owning TIPS?  Nonzero counterparty risk.  See? Not in the same risk class at all.


See protip above.  Also, who's shilling for investment products now?
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you think.  If you like TIPS, buy them.  Nobody is forcing you to buy bitcoins.  I don't give a shit what you do, or how you piss your money away.  Good luck.

Short story time:
Once upon a time, on Reddit, two shortish and free books were presented to the statist. Both books shared practical decentralized solutions to social problems, most of which have been tried in the past to success.  What did the statist do? Within minutes, he tried to shame the person sharing the books, then he angrily buried his head in the sand and bolted to his ultimate statist "conflict resolution" position: *"no practical solutions... oh, btw, you angry and cray!!!"*.
What can we learn from that event?  That the statist *just doesn't want to know*.  We can always bring the mule to water, but it's up to the mule to drink.

What Mike Hearn proposes is to add a policy that will allow *routing* nodes to read keys from a blacklist, and if the keys belong to a hidden service, *refuse to route* clients to that hidden service.   This can be then exploited by strangers to block access to stuff like Dark Market Reloaded, or Bitcoin Fog.
The proposal is an encroachment of the technology that embeds *direct censorship* on a technology that is intended to be *for censorship circumvention*.

I don't think *you* need to address the red herrings.  In that conversation, you have given *nonsequitorial* reasons to support your idea of adding censorship lists (which you innocuously termed "hidden service policies") to Tor.
You implied that, if Tor had a censorship feature, then governments would be "less inclined" to see us Tor users as "a group" and try to compromise our security.  [I quote](


Well, guess what: too bad that already happens. These governments have *already* decided to target us as a group, and they already built the technology to do so; adding censorship to Tor is not going to stop their aggressions against ourselves, our equipment and our safety -- it will simply destroy Tor as a censorship circumvention mechanism.  One would have to be either *idiotic* or *venal* to believe the bullshit idea that Tor gaining a censorship mechanism will make these governments go "oh, geez, now we must wind down our Tor compromise infrastructure!" and stop spying on Tor users.
You also openly [advocated against a security fix]( that *needs* to go into Tor, in order to protect hidden service operators.


Hey, Mike, how do you even rationalize that to yourself?  The Devil's Advocate card is a card you've played in the past.  You are a smart man so I am not going to pretend you can't deduce cause and consequence -- do you actually *want* people to get murdered or arrested as a result of Tor not offering them the guarantees that the Tor project promised?
All of these are non-arguments to add a censorship subsystem to Tor.

This is absolutely and categorically incorrect, down to the cause of the Internet monopolies and your (baseless) perception that the Internet is "far less regulated".

This is a common economics meme, and it's a complete fabrication\* invented in the 1920's as an excuse for the superiority of government-mandated monopolies.  I can dig up a reference if you'd like.
The reality is that any monopoly that doesn't have the power to enforce itself -- that means, no government will punish its competitors -- sees itself contested by newcomers.  Contrast that to the many decades-old government-created monopolies that exist today, and you'll see how long-lasting monopolies, in reality, are a consequence of *government*.
See the comments below for proof.
\* In sum, the pro-monopoly argument goes something like this: "Because (p1) monopolies are bad, and (p2) some monopolies are both inevitable and self-perpetuating, (p3) it's better to have the government create monopolies."  This argument has a nonsequitorial conclusion that ought to be totally absurd to anyone with two brain cells:
1. First of all, no evidence was ever presented that monopolies are bad -- "bad for *whom*?" is the key question nobody ever asks or answers.
2. Second, no evidence was presented that monopolies are inevitable and self-perpetuating forever.
3. If monopolies are bad, as the argument posits in the first premise, then having powerful people create monopolies, that nobody is allowed to compete with, would be absolutely terrible -- the exact opposite of what benefits everybody, because it benefits *the monopolists* at the expense of *everybody else*.
Unsurprisingly, this fallacious argument was proposed by (a) the powerful and corrupt people who (b) had connections to make government-created monopolies for themselves, (c) stood to benefit from all those government-created monopolies, and (d) wanted to avoid the backlash from the public.

Source: I have friends from Ecuador and from Venezuela who keep me up to date with what's going on there.
If they check your phone, and they find that stuff there, you go to jail.  Of course, they will steal the phone and the coins.
This is not a joke.  There are super strict import restrictions there, put in place as revenge against "rich" people who have enough money to, say, fly to the U.S. to buy a TV set or a phone and then return with those items.  Import of gold and silver is strictly forbidden, and is legally considered a jailable offense.  The number of items you can import without them being stolen upon re-entry has been dwindling steadily for the past ten years or so.
Also, you won't be able to use your phone anyway.  Roaming or not, it needs to be registered with some phone company there, with your name associated to it, and some form of government-issued ID as well.
So do the smart thing: make sure that, upon entering the country, *they can't tell you're bringing the coins in*.  And don't expect to spend your coins there -- *only* if you know someone you can *trust not to rat you out to the cops*, you can sell the coins to them.

It's not rocket science.  Monopolies arise **all the time**.  Every time someone invents something new that no one else is offering, and it suddenly gets popular, bam, monopoly -- that's pretty much a monopoly by definition, because nobody is offering that new thing aside from the first group of people who conceived it.
It *doesn't matter* though.  What matters is **whether competition appears to challenge** the monopoly, otherwise the monopoly becomes *lasting*.  Key to this insight is the very much obvious fact that, when you try to compete, and then you are threatened with being thrown in a cage or losing everything, *you are not likely to try and compete*.
As you can imagine, when the government is involved in protecting the monopolist, *no competition can challenge the monopoly*, because *nobody wants to go broke and into a cage* for competing with another business.
Whether a group gets a *lasting monopoly* on some activity has nothing to do with how much money they have, how good they are at doing the activity, how early they were or whether they were the first mover.  The *only* cause for *lasting monopolies* is *threats* against people who want to compete with the monopolies.  And the *only* entity that can get away with these threats is *the government*.
We discuss this matter further here:

Again wrong.  What you said earlier is not just an opinion like "chocolate ice cream is my favorite", but actually a truth-bearing claim that is inconsistent with observable reality, very trivially proven wrong with just one counterexample of the many available on YouTube.  So, opinion or not, your claim is as wrong as the claim that circles are squares.
Like another person said, Irwin Schiff is the counterexample that proves your claim wrong.  So is Larken Rose, and so is the latest corpse created by cops (agents of the state) in St. Louis. All people hurt for not complying. At this point, should you continue to insist on your belief while having been informed of how it is incorrect, you necessarily transition from being simply uninformed to a common liar.

You can't get more denialist than that.  I mean, there's video.
Do you have proof that the video is doctored?
Are you denying that there is a remote firmware vulnerability in the machine you saw in the video?
Are you denying that the firmware can be used remotely to steal keystrokes, or anything in the system memory for that matter?
Why do you deny your own (and everybody else's) eyes?
What exactly are you refusing to accept here?
You've already been proven wrong when you said "no such thing is possible", by experts in the matter who clearly have more of a clue about computer security than you.  Is it face you're trying to save here?
What's your beef with reality?  You don't like it therefore you accuse reality of being "paranoid"?  Who's delusional here, the guy showing video of a computer vulnerability, or the guy grasping at straws to deny that this is a problem?
If you don't want so be discredited any further, there is a super easy option: *walk away*.  Leave people who care about the security of their money alone.  That way you get to look like a decent person instead of a sore loser.
All I'm saying is: you know, basic decency, don't be a douche and waste my time making me type stuff, if your plan is to deny it and call "paranoid" anyway, when it becomes obvious that your position is absurd.  You're wrong, but you don't have to be a cunt about it.

WOW, FEAR ME, MY IDEAS ARE NOT THE SAME AS YOURS, BOO!


More of the standard "anarchy!" scaremongering.
Look, buddy, your Hollywood nightmare doesn't scare me, and it hasn't scared me for about ten years, because I left the childish civics obedience training behind, and learned what governments really are.
The governments you so idiotically believe "protect" you, actually murdered:
1. 270+ million
2. of their own people
3. excluding wars
4. just in the 20th century alone.
When you say "protect", what you really mean is *ruin*.  The people who you *say* "protect" you, actually *kill* you if you disobey and resist them, [and sometimes they kill people just for sport](  And none of those people have any obligation to protect you from anything at all.
So your belief in your "protectors", and your doubling down on them when confronted with the facts, is *strictly delusional*.  It's Stockholm Syndrome.  It generates pity in me that your very mind is enslaved to these people, people who would have absolutely no problem throwing your sorry ass in a cage if they wanted to, kidnapping your children away, and ruining your family.  That you consider them to be your "protectors" puts you at around the same level of autonomy and emotional competence as any battered wife who insists that hubby only beats her up because he Loves Her^^TM .  Sure, they "Love You^^TM ", so next time you see the flashing lights, prepare to stop so they can Share The Love.
But that's not important.  What's important is that I am not afraid of your fairy tales.  You came into the discussion thinking that you could manipulate me with fears.  You brought a knife to a gunfight.

They can't effectively ban people installing, say, Mycelium on their phone, and then trading peer to peer.  They simply don't have the manpower, and they also have a false reputation of "protectors" to guard, so if they go on a rampage of imprisoning *lots* of people, the façade they so carefully put up crumbles rather rapidly.
This, of course, leads to many negative consequences for the rulers and their ambitions of maintaining power and control over others.  It is relatively easy for 10% of the population to conclude "well, these guys are literally robbers who hurt people, so this year I'm not paying any taxes" and follow up on that.  Like that, 10% of the money the rulers were stealing the year before, poof, vanished.  Without that money, they can't bribe the imbecile portion of the populace that props them and their benevolent façade up.
Or, worse, the people *could* overwhelm the praetors enforcing the rules of the masters, and behead a few of the masters for a nice lesson in what happens when the masters become *too* criminal.  People running rackets under the name "government" know this, so they know not to push their luck very much.

Technically I don't even need to *prove* you wrong -- it is *you* who needs to *prove* your *own* claims -- but I like to do it for sport; discrediting bullshitters like you, by *honestly* proving them wrong, is fun for me.
In this case, to refute your "no established standards or regulations", all I need to prove you wrong, is to show the *effects* of the regulations that demonstrate their existence.
Here is where I do that: [Case in point](


Bam!  That's evidence of (a) an existing financial regulation that (b) Gox didn't comply with, isn't it?
So yes, I *don't need to name regulations by name* -- all I need to show is that they *exist*, which I have done.
More importantly, you cannot come back to me and tell me you're right and I'm wrong because I "refuse to name regulations".   At most, you can tell me that I'm a dick to you, and that's probably even truthful, but that won't prove your allegations right.

Some speculate that the first prototypes of malware that did this was the malware used to sabotage off-network computers operating nuclear plants a few years ago (I forget the name).  Speculations aside, we know these covert channels are real and can be used today.
Mind you: "A few years ago" for secret operations usually means "available off the shelf" in the dark vuln markets today.

OK, so what type of video evidence would persuade you?
1. Video evidence of people being forcibly taken away for not surrendering money to the institution you worship?
2. Or video evidence of people being shot to death for resisting orders of that institution?
I got both. Choose which one to start with.  I also got bonus video of people being shot to death for not even resisting the armed people you consider virtuous and necessary.

[To disastrous consequences.](


I don't think that, necessarily and in the absence of a small violent monopoly, everything would be privately owned.  Quite a few things will be communally owned, just as it is tacitly understood today by people who communally own things.  More importantly, though, there will arise many new, novel, and bespoke theories of ownership ("who gets to use what when") that aren't allowed to be implemented today, because the violent monopoly has an opinion, and that opinion is incompatible with many theories of ownership.

You seem to have gotten the wrong impression.  I'm not debating with you.  I knew from the start that you weren't going to change your mind -- dishonesty in a person is practically proof that a person won't change his mind.  Moreover, I don't waste my time trying to persuade people who think that *forcing* others to obey is virtuous, because they themselves don't want to persuade anyone either -- they just want to *force* their opinions on others, preferably with as little resistance as possible (hence the lies).
I'm simply showing others how what you said (including the whole of extortion being "compromise" and impositions being "agreement") *amounts to nothing but lies, manipulation and doublespeak*.

Ah, so I guess the government-granted patents on Microsoft Windows and Microsoft MS-DOS, that allowed them to become so rich over many years, rich enough to force nearly every computer maker to install Microsoft Windows, that chain of events had *nothing to do* with Microsoft forcing Microsoft Internet Explorer onto forced Microsoft Windows users buying computers from forced Microsoft Windows computer makers.
Yeah, that reasoning totally checks out... *if you selectively remember and forget facts that contradict your theory*.  Let's summarize your theory:
-- Microsoft was created  
-&gt; Money just *magically appears* in Microsoft's bank account, with no causative reason *whatsoever*  
-&gt; Microsoft leverages that money to force computer makers into installing Windows  
-&gt; Microsoft uses its Windows monopoly to force people to install IE.
Here's the reality which you have oh so ever selectively suppressed:
-- Microsoft was created  
-&gt; Microsoft [arduously advocates for]( and then *collects* government monopolies **&lt;- see this part, feller?  this is the part that you dishonestly suppress**  
-&gt; Microsoft uses those monopolies and government courts to sue everybody who may compete with those government monopolies  
-&gt; Potential competitors to Microsoft can no longer compete with Microsfot by producing products with the features that Microsoft had monopolized through the government  
-&gt; Money appears in Microsoft's bank account, as a consequence of being *the only one* providing software that incorporates these monopolies  
-&gt; Microsoft leverages that money to force computer makers into installing Windows  
-&gt; Microsoft uses its Windows monopoly to force people to install IE.

There's this common misconception that Microsoft was a natural monopoly, again commonly used to defend the theory of natural monopolies.  Completely false.
[Microsoft has thousands of artificial government-granted monopolies](  And that's just patents -- we aren't even considering copyrights (another type of government enforced monopoly) there.
So, every time anyone tried to compete with Microsoft by producing a better or cheaper version of the products they built, all Microsoft had to do (and did) was ask the government to shut them down.
Imagine for a second, if you could call a buncha thugs to seize and destroy your neighbors' lemonade stand, because you "had a patent" for making lemonade.     Wouldn't you be rich (and hated)?
Now imagine if everybody else could just do the same thing for every little category and way of doing a thing.
Well, that's *exactly* how the contemporary software industry is.  A handful of giant feuds who have many government-granted monopolies on doing certain things, *that nobody else is allowed to compete with*.
Do you understand now, how the software industry is one of the most monopolistic industries?  Have you noticed how the industry is dominated by giant corporations, and little startups usually get destroyed by lawsuits or bought out by giant corporations?  How many little startups *didn't form* because they could have been sued by the government at the behest of someone else who claims to be "the inventor" of a similar, normally obvious idea?
So, you see, this is why I say that there is no evidence for this theory of natural monopolies.  Every time someone brings an example of a "natural monopoly", it's *so absurdly easy* to reveal how *the government* caused that monopoly to artificially arise, I barely bother to note it these days.

No, incorrect, the outcome is the same either way.
Courts have ruled that having a service online, no matter what you block, constitutes an admission that your service could be used in prohibited places; that's why you need -- the proposed law **requires** you -- to collect personally identifiable information and explicitly tell people "no, YOU can't use our service because you are in NY".  **You do not need to trust me or anyone, just read the proposal -- it is spelled there loud and clear.**
That is the only act that you, as a service operator, can do in order to get courts to not automatically presume your guilt.  Saying "oh, not to worry, we blocked NY resident IPs" *is going to get you in PMITA prison or extradited real fucking fast*.
This requirement to collect PII is, if you reread the announcement, exactly why the pool is planning to shut down.  Not to mention it destroys the anonymity of mining, obviously.
Ultimately, you may still stubbornly disagree with the pool's decision, or their counsel's analysis.  Doesn't mattes.  First, the counsel is correct, you are not. This is why he gets paid to counsel and you don't.  Second, the pool will do what the counsel advises them, not what you advise anyone. So your opinion is irrelevant.
