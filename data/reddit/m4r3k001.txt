Dear cex team.
sry for my oscene language but i have been waiting almost 1 mouth,and i have tryd to contact you,and all i got is "Due to extremely high load of requests it will take us extra time to resolve your issue" also alot of people saying that they didnt get there money back.
2. nobody till now (cex) have askd me for my private accouunt history..nobody...and thats the 1. sign when somebody trying to find something wrong so that they can tell "sry but we canot verify you and we will take your btc"
3. i have send you KYC/AML pdf file like 1-2 mounth ago,and till now nobody have given me a ok sign or not ok NOBODY,and you say to me "that can last some time"???
im waiting now already a mounth and after your support site dont work,and you dont replay on mail,no you tell me tat can last some time??
I WANT MY MONEY BACK A.S.A.P !!!!!!!!!!!!! atleast give me the oportunity to trade,and then you can verify as long as you want
but now my btc are blocked and i cant do shit if the price drops,just bcos you have to "find" some way to say "your money is our"
4. another common awnser "during the 4 years...." i dont care how long you work, but you cannot seas someones money and ask that they wait months until you unblock them
so dear cex team pls hurry up bcos i cant wait anymore !!!

tnx for your help.cex did contact me but with no help,just that they are overloaded.
i send btc from another wallet to cex.io and in cex.io in transactions says it have been recieved and confirmed, but it's pending i think cex admin must aprove it...so if it's 2000confirmation already,then i think it's confirmed right?
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:09:08
13.11.2017. i have deposit 2.2btc and the confirmation have been confirmed but still no btc in my cex wallet.
