I'm sure you've heard about "the community" behind dogecoin. That is what has my attention. There is an entire generation that is about to enter the workforce who have grown up with the internet (the internet as we know it today), making them much more comfortable with digital transactions, online interactions, and a different appreciation for online content then older cohorts. I am generalizing the entire public, not those exclusively working in a tech related industry (this will make all the difference). They will already be familiar with dogecoin as a result of the massive tipping and ongoing charity campaigns. The niche I see dogecoin fulfilling is via everyday online interactions. You see a great piece of content on r/history, don't bother "upvoting" or the Facebook equivalent of a "like", instead you will be able to transfer something with actual value. This is no different than what you can do with bitcoin, however dogecoin has a (seemingly) lower barrier to entry, and people will be more comfortable with the coin for micro transactions from the good will and publicity the community is currently raising. I believe dogecoins niche will be more for content and software transactions vs. exchanging it for tangible goods in the offline world. I do not think a dogecoin being valued at $0.01 in a couple of years is far fetched. (I'm typing from my phone, my apologies if my writing is cumbersome).

I'm going to comment and take these downvotes with you so a few years from now we can repost this and make the same exact point OP made with this post.

Sorry to hear that. All of my interactions with moolah/prelude have been good.
