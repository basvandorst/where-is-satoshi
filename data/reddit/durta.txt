Sad that this isn't possible anymore with the current climate

This is a copypasta right?
That doesn't change its widespread use in electronics and dentistry which isn't going away. Also gold is very much in style especially with young people because of hip-hop culture. If you're more "high class" it still is extremely popular because of its value. Especially white gold is used now in literally every wedding ring I see.
Bitcoin doesn't have a future. Anyone who takes investing seriously or does it as an occupation doesn't invest into bitcoin. People on Wallstreet literally say if they find any of their traders investing into bitcoin they'll fire them. It's a joke. 
Even as far as cryptos go, bitcoin is a really shitty one.

Have fun with your gamble when your bubble pops!

???????????? 
You're trolling right? Go look at your mom's jewelry and tell me there isn't gold there. Look at your computer processors, hdmi cables, or open up the wiring and tell me there isn't gold there.

That alone won't save your investment. It doesn't compare to gold.

The internet bubble did pop though. Do you not remember the .com crash in the 2000s?

Gold is a precious mineral. It has scarcity and actually has value outside of the stock market. It's used in jewelry, dentistry, and tons of electronics.
In other words, gold has a floor. Bitcoin doesn't. This means while it can infinitly go up, it can also infinitly go down.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:06
The reason why gold is so valued is because it has actual uses outside of the stock market.

Plastics can't be used in processors. Or any components gold is used for that matter. Plastic can't be used in jewelry, and it can't be used in dentistry. 
Get your head out of your ass. It doesn't have value.

They don't

There literally isn't enough food to go around. I'm sure if the mother could give more she would but she can't unless she starves her own family as well. The fact that 4 slices of bread is a huge salary compared to other maids is telling enough. 
When you're in that much poverty you don't have the luxury of counting calories. You eat what you can get.

That's even better than money in Venezuela right now. Food is so expensive that a lot of jobs advertise the fact that they pay in food.

If knew anything about Venezuela or Maduro then you would know that it is the last thing you want to sponsor your crypto. 
He's literally one of the most corrupt politicians and his whole country is starving because of it. If the biggest scammer in the world says "this thing is good" then everyone knows it's not.

I can literally edit my comment to replace money with food and the message is the same. I don't see a circle here.

You'd be surprised how generous people are when they have so little. Especially in South America, there's more of a sense of helping your neighbor in any way you can.

Would rather have 4 slices of bread to give to your kids and go hungry yourself for the day or stay at home and be like "sorry kids I know you're working to help the family but I don't have any bread for you because I'm conserving energy" 
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:49:02
I see what you're saying but if she did that then her household wouldn't have enough money to get food to feed her kids and husband. 
She's sacrificing her own health and energy in order to feed her family. 
Honestly, even her children are most likely working despite how young they might be just so there can be a bit more food on the table. 
Everyone pitches in when it comes down to this. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:03:14
Then the maid would work...where? Oh she wouldn't. That would be great for her family. I'm sure the maid is grateful to even be employed right now. 
You really don't understand the state of Venezuela right now. Unless you're Maduro or his close friend then you're low on food. Everyone is low in food but everyone is trying to help each other out.

Only as a baby tho. We have no clue how strong or weak he'd be when he grows up. He might pull a Gohan and want to just study with Videl all day.

I see where you're coming from because any exposure is good, but literally nobody trusts this man. I wouldn't want anything I use tied in with an image of him.
