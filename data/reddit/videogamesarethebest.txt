Yea. But I go to the trezor.io/start
why do you ask?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:17:21
I am awaiting a reply. I posted over on Trezor reddit and no support has answered my question. I did email them and they answered my first email and asked if I deleted my cookies. I replied back and asked some more questions but have not received an answer yet and it has been several days. 
I just want a better explanation on why this error message is happening. I am hoping this message could not possibly come up if a Trezor (with my seed) was being used on another computer. I am hoping this error message would only come up if another Trezor (with my seed) was being used on my same computer. That way I would know it was just a cookie type error. I just want to make sure my coins are safe.

Okay cool. Thanks for the reply.

The message is not showing anymore. But, the first time it happened was many weeks ago and it just happened again a few days ago. Next time it happens I will be certain to examine everything.

which one is a supported browser? Firefox seems to work fine but IE says it's not supported. I assumed Firefox was.

Thanks for the reply. The error message has not come up in days. But, I have been trying to "induce" the error message but cannot really do it. I just want a logical explantation on why this message has happened two times. I have opened a tab in firefox will trezor was running but I only get a error message that says something like "device being used in another window." But, it's not the same message I got as before.
Have you ever seen a error like this before? I am just hoping it's something to do with the cookies on firefox. I wonder if the error message is even possible if someone was trezor (with my seed) on another computer? Or would this message be limited to the device being used only on my current pc?
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:38:22
I am thinking that is possible. But, how can I be sure?

Thanks guys. Is ledgerwallet.com the official website to purchase it from? I think I will play it safe and get it from the official source just in case. Do they allow payment with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:52:52
My main concern is if somebody else could be using my trezor seed? Or could this error message only happen if someone was actually using my same device on the same computer? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:38:47
Hi. I was using Firefox browser at the time. As far as I know, I didn't have any other wallets or browsers open. I can't say for sure though because I didn't worry about the message at first. Now everything seems fine but I am worried why the message occurred at all. Now everything is working fine but should I be worried someone else is using a trezor with my seed on another computer? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:33:04
What do you mean? Everything is working fine. My transactions, balance etc are all normal. I just got this error message 2 times and am worried someone could have access to my device since it said it was being used in another window. I didn't see any other windows open when it said that but didn't look hard because I wasn't worried at the time. 
But, I began to wonder what this error mean't. Maybe it's just a glitch with cookies or something on the web browser? Just wondering too if anyone else has had this error? Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:17:46
Do they accept bitcoin as payment? Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:51:36
Yes. I restarted it. Now everything appears normal. I am just worried though why it came up in the first place. Maybe just a cookie issue? Thanks

Yea. It was sealed and had the trezor stickers too. The box was glued shut nicely. All of that seemed fine. The weird thing was the U haul truck delivery combined with the two small chips on the plastic.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:08:44
Guys. I ordered this device so I could feel perfectly secure storing bitcoins when I eventually earn more. I think I am going to reorder the device and request a refund. I like to be "better safe than sorry." 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:45:52
I have sent support a message and am awaiting a reply. I called DHS delivery in my area and the woman claimed she has worked there for a long time and has never ever heard of anyone delivering a package in Uhaul truck/van.

How do you add a image to reddit?? I cannot get it to work correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:46:19
Good point :) I order another one just to put my mind at ease.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:28:41
Is there a way to test out my Trezor to make sure my seed works without potentially risking the safety of exposing my seed? Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:46:20
Okay. I will post pic in a minute. Good idea.
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:09:31
I am scared if I restore the words on the Trezor, it could put my wallet at risk. I mean, it should be okay if I got a receive and send address right? If I do a small test send and it arrives, all is good right? Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:46:16
Thanks. I looked at the image in that review. It does look similar to what mine has. It is much less obvious. Maybe it is normal? Does anyone else have a Trezor here? None the less, I decided to order another one just to feel better.
I figure worse comes to worse, I will have 2 Trezor wallets :) I will see if the new one has the same "chip" on it and hopefully this one won't arrive in a U-Haul truck lol.
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:54:26
Thanks. How would I know if I set it up incorrectly? Is there a way? I made a new pin and got a new recovery seed. That means the wallet is good to go right?
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:35:25
Well I think there is a new setup process now that is different. I am not sure though.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:30:33
Oh....I think Trezor changed the process recently. I see a blog post talking about the new start up procedure. Maybe that's it.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:16:56
I did go there. But how come it's acting like I can wipe the device again? Should I wipe it again?
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:24:28
Yea but I dont see anything about creating a new seed word. I just takes me back to the normal wallet. I can click the receive tab and it displays an address etc.
