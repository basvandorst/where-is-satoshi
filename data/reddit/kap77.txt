This guy clearly doesn't understand that there are altcoins that can't be traced at all. Or that you can simply tumble coins using an exchange. Or that there are tumblers both out of their jurisdiction and on the dark net.
Here is a protip for you regulators: You can't do anything about tumbling without outright making crypto illegal.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:38:19
There is nothing improper about it. It is completely legal to do.

Blockchain.info just hosts the wallet file but can't see what's inside, correct?
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:07:51
A while ago I was doing ATM cash deposits then using the Chase app to quickpay to a relative of mine who would then buy me bitcoin on Coinbase (I couldn't verify for instant). I would then tumble the BTC into my anonymous wallet and sell on localbitcoin in person. Doing so, I amassed a ton of bitcoin in profit that is still being held today (but no fiat profit). This is the stuff of bank and IRS nightmares. How do you audit something like that? 
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:44:34
I like how you are honest about your basement dwelling lifestyle.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:20:34
Coinbase and nobody else. The business of providing instant Bitcoin is incredibly risky. Even with all the hoops, people STILL defraud Coinbase regularly.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:37:16
I certainly don't mean to say that, but if both were left in my house and something went missing I think I could reasonably suspect one to be the thief over the other. I am simply approaching this with a healthy dose of skepticism. Large, popular apps have entire teams and companies reputations behind them. A no-name app from John Developer does not get that same trust from me. With all that said, I really didn't mean for this to become a discussion trying to discredit OP, I was simply advocating for open source. I don't know the technical details, but if what OP said was true then my skepticism was unnecessary in the first place (would require some research).

Really? Jesus Christ. I have (some) BTC on stamp but I can't verify my ID whenever I try. Only like 0.1 BTC but fuck I just got robbed.

If not them then who?
@_date: 2014-12-22 06:14:58
Ok but there is no way to tell who owns what address. Also, tumblers.

Yep, terrible.
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:12:50
What is really needed (if you want something laypeople are already comfortable with) is simply bitcoin debit cards in mutiple countries. Send bitcoin to someones debit card address in India and they can spend that as Rupees seamlessly or even withdraw from an ATM. No retail locations required. The younger, working generation across seas can send bitcoin to their grandparents who can then spend it like normal money without even knowing they are using bitcoin. No going to a WU location, no waiting in line, lower fees.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:42:24
And knowing the motive for the crime is not relevant to the case how?

If he understood that, he would not be "wrestling with whether to ban or restrict the use of "tumblers"".

It isn't outrageous, but it certainly doesn't make bitstamp look like they give a shit about bitcoin as anything other than a means to an end.

Answers OP. Heard about this scam before but never figured out how it worked.
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:23:20
I don't have the documents required to verify and I can't withdraw without verifying so I just got goxxed by bitstamp for 0.1 BTC.

The only "effective" regulation would come from the federal level. New York could "ban" bitcoins completely, but New Jersey is a few miles away. States shouldn't be wasting their time with this.

You can minimize risk without completely eliminating it. The MOST LIKELY kind of app that might threaten my wallet will be bitcoin related, it is almost certain. I don't install random apps, and I certainly don't install random apps related to bitcoin. It is just common sense. I disable scripts in my browser, but I don't avoid web browsers entirely.

How will the attackers make new accounts when Circle requires a bank account verification and all banks (hopefully?) require 2FA upon access from a new location?

Basically, yes. Any criminal money laundering operation already has access to electronic forgeries. This only hurts legit customers like me who lack the documentation to verify and withdraw their coins.

You are an idiot then.

Fumbling? You have your camera look at a box and it automatically inputs the address and amount. Not as easy as NFC (which Bitcoin could do also) but QR codes are easy as fuck to use.

Aww man that makes me happy to see. He could have cashed it all out long ago for a guaranteed large sum. The fact that he held on the way down to 300 and continues to hold on the way back up just makes me feel good for some reason. And of course, I hope the coins that he did spend have provided new model trains, some lawyer fees, and many free lunches.

The same guys doing CC fraud online are stealing and selling databases of stolen information like SSNs. What really protects Circle here is that you need to do a bank account verification. That will ward off 99% of fraud because any competent bank immediately asks for 2FA upon login from an unrecognized computer even if the attacker did manage to get the persons bank login.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:20:40

@_date: 2014-10-17 16:56:13
The documentation they require, yes. They don't accept phone bills, electronic bills, or credit card statements as proof of residency. I don't have any other bills. It's not like I don't have a bank account or valid ID. I can get documentation from the state I live in, but fuck dealing with that when there are so many alternatives.
Bitcoin is supposed to be accessible to everyone, not just those with specific documentation. How can someone in Africa use bitstamp? They probably can't.

I can see how it is easy to track "12.5721 BTC" through a tumbler if there is a matching "12.5721 BTC" output, but if the transactions are split into a series of random parts equaling 12.5721 BTC and sent to different addresses then how can you keep track of the coins reliably?
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:04:52
Oh I get it. I was thinking "Why would you tell the IRS about your bitcoin" without realizing that obviously cashing the bitcoin out into cash means the money came from somewhere.
For my purposes, I don't think about converting back into USD as everything I am interested in using my gains for can be bought on Amazon (or by using the gift cards that amazon sells [hint: it is more than gyft]).
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:17:10
Why not? One tumbler output address would just send to the input address of another tumbler and then output to your wallet.

Hold you in contempt of court. The only way it works is if they don't know you have the Bitcoin.
EDIT: Of course, there is no way to prove HOW MUCH bitcoin you have unless you have revealed that as well. You can always tumble a small amount of coin into a separate wallet and present the court with that instead of the full amount.
