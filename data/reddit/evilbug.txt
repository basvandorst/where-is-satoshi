If you are travelling to Europe you should visit the so called (world famous in the scene,bitcoiners from all over the world gathering here!) Bitcoin Kiez in Berlin (Kiez is german for neighborhood)an area around the Gräfestreet with a lot of different Bars ,shops,craftsmen,catering services and (for Germany of course) a brewery.All accepting Bitcoins.Also there is the next BXB (=Berlin Bitcoin Exchange)on 21st December, a real life Bitcoin Exchange with semiprofessional brokers with traditional Bowler broker hats.(
Google and look on youtube  for more info,example: 
Also I recommend a guy named Jörg Platzer.He owns the bar/restaurant named Room 77 (  ),and was reported the  first business owner  in Germany, who accepted bitcoins for payment and founded the Bitcoin Kiez .Get in touch with him on Room 77 webpage.He is also elected for president of the german bitcoin foundation.
He speaks perfectly english .Also Oliver Flaskämper founder of  the web based Exchange bitcoin.de is located in Berlin.Also you can spend your bitcoins at the Berlin Xmas market actually (Schanzen Kiez)!

Still down for me for two hours now -why only a few USD owner use Kraken and so much EUR owners-mainly I guess from Germany because of the connection to Fidor Bank the largest Web-only bank there.
