It's still not as patronising as the Chinese approach which says they made it illegal as a payment method because they want to protect citizens. They don't even bother with the "think of the children" mantra of the west, it's just "we don't want you to get hurt, so we banned bitcoin".

"I can tell you it by all means the most important drug one can take during treatment" - random redditor.
I was getting a lecture from an oncologist today about cancer drugs, and someone asked about medical marijuana. He said many of the positive effects (increased appetite, decreased nausea, anxiolytic) can be achieved more effectively through standard medications. He said older people who have never used it before, and try it on cancer, can become psychotic.

I know the bigger picture. Bitcoin allows for basically free, instant, and global money transfer without relying on a 3rd party. It is fantastic. But it is currently not a realistic alternative to PayPal in terms of things consumers care about: convenience and efficiency.
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:35:01

This was my son and he was my only son. No-one would wish this on any other parent. Enough is enough. The sheer product range available to our kids to experiment in drugs is mind boggling and growing every day helped by new manufacturers from far flung parts of the globe. I have had my son's friends tell me that buying drugs online is safer because its "user rated" and anonymous and they don't have to meet drug dealer types. Yet it is so much more dangerous. Bitcoin is operating as the principal marketing organisation for these criminals. Australia does not have to expose itself to this. Bitcoin's role is mindboggling. They hide (encrypt) the payment for the drugs so that no-one knows or can trace where the money goes. This means drug dealers are simply getting brazen because they know the police cant trace them. It is no use going after a dealer or a drug dealing website. There are three factors to this equation 1. Tor Browser + 2. Bitcoin + 3. Online drug websites = a massive problem. It is not only alcohol on our streets that is causing problems. It is alcohol and drugs. I had no idea. Thereare parents in my sons circle who would have no idea but the facebook friends do have an idea what has been going on. Come on Tony Abbott, and every other politician. Stop ALL our banks accommodating bitcoin. Stop wasting resources to send police to try to find the sellers when you know they cant. Stop 80% of this trade with legislation banning our banks dealing with Bitcoin. If a transaction has to be encrypted then in nine times out of ten it will be to evade taxes or deal in the black market. Its just not right. Every other payment system is traceable even paypal. We do not need this Black Bank. That is all Bitcoin is.

@_date: 2014-04-27 09:25:19
You've got no idea what you're talking about. Satoshi's coins are identifiable because he was presumably the only person mining when Bitcoin began.
Bitcoin addresses can be created by a simple algorithm - you don't need to register it with anyone. It is created, and isn't listed on the blockchain until it has had bitcoin sent to it.

PayPal would have worked better. It would have saved me a fair bit of time and money. I needed a new phone, and going through bitcoin made it more difficult than it otherwise would have been.
PayPal has a few drawbacks, but to act like using bitcoin doesn't have significant ones is just mental. The cognitive dissonance in this place is incredible.

Are all the private keys on the trezor derived from the same paper seed? How does that work?
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:57:19
People started using the internet when it became useful and better than alternatives. The alternative to bitcoin would have saved me about $40 on a new phone, and a heap of time/energy.
What was I wrong about? Bitcoin is not really useful for most consumers at the moment. Is that actually debatable?
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:29:05
Yeah - it's funny how I got 75% upvotes despite it being posted in r/bitcoin. I am sure the "buttcoin banker lovers" definitely outnumber bitcoiners here.
I hold about 4:1 BTC:$$$. I am not spreading FUD. I actually took the time to have a think about legitimate shortcomings of BTC for the average consumer, and share them here. If you would like to argue what I wrote about PayPal vs bitcoin in my experience of buying a phone, why don't you put some points together. If there's currently a better option for consumers you should WAKE THE FUCK UP and accept they will take it, that's how competition works.

Yeah man. Bitcoin is better than anything else. It certainly made my purchase of a new phone super easy. Couldn't fault it at all. Way better than PayPal.

That doesn't change the fact that it is still a whole lot easier for people to use PayPal at the moment than bitcoin. Whether you care about it or not, wider consumer will be what determines what it's eventually worth (or not worth)... Your points don't really address the legitimate current shortcomings of bitcoin, especially those based around of "progress" or "completely natural at this stage".

Who even knows man. It's kinda fucked though if people will blindly follow it without considering the damage that this party could inflict upon it. I love Bitcoin, I think it is great. But if it becomes a centralised power (even though geographically dispersed) I don't think it's worth the risk of holding it. That requires the trust of a 3rd party that Bitcoin was designed to overcome.

How would it make revenue to continue running?
Fractional reserve - no way I would ever deposit with them
Fee on transactions/savings - no thanks
Real banks give depositors peace of mind because their individual savings are usually backed by gov't to several hundred thousand (here in Australia anyway). If a bitcoin bank lost the bitcoin - more bitcoin can't just be printed off and credited to users.
Does anyone know if Coinbase offers users any fraud-protection? I don't know a lot about it, but it seems to be a bit like PayPal in that it is a conduit between personal savings and the merchant?
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:52:10
I am out about $40 from depreciation, and acquiring bitcoin also had expenses, and also time. What was there for me to gain from using bitcoin for the purchase over PayPal?

Yeah, definitely. I would never store bulk BTC on an externally produced wallet.. But if they were produced just with the purpose of serving everyday trades (like &lt;$10) it could be a good way to initiate new people. People are happy enough to trust Casascius, I don't think it'd be a great leap to trust another group to produce wallets.
Thanks for linking that, I've never seen it before. That's actually a lot like what I am thinking, but more like a ticket style thing. Like having a little booklet that they can be torn from and filled on demand.

Is anyone else concerned that these 1M could be dumped at any point? I am slower to jump to the conclusion that Satoshi is entirely benevolent than a lot of other people here are. I just don't see the logic in amassing that amount of coin and holding it unless there is an eventual plan to trade it in at a (much) higher price point. I feel like if he didn't care about personal gains, he would have transferred most of his original work to a burner.
I know he created the currency and is entitled to it. I am not questioning that at all. But I think a real downfall of Bitcoin is that about 10% of the currency is owned by a single anonymous party.
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:51:51
I think so.. I think that unless something REALLY bad happens, a market cap of ~$10B is way too small for a growing transaction / storage network like BTC!

@_date: 2014-06-07 12:54:35
The low 'market cap' is why I bought a stake. It is even lower when you consider the amount of early mined coins that have been 'lost' by the miners.
It is young days, and as a currency (not a publicly traded stock) it has more potential for ordinary people to take part in it, leading to much higher market caps. If every person in the US decided to own on average $5 worth, that would put $1.5B worth of buys. That would lead to a disproportionately higher 'market cap' value jump.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:27:56

I've been waiting for this glorious day!!..
How is the Bitcoin network immune to a DOS attack? I don't understand how a website can be taken down through spam, but Bitcoin cannot.
Is there a minimum speed internet connection I can use and still be beneficial to the network, and not slow it down?
If there is a fork in the blockchain, and I have had coins saved on it for a while (ie months before it happened), does this mean they are immune to it?
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:13:48

@_date: 2014-01-17 06:30:35
That $10B is only market price x number in circulation. If Apple tried to buy up $1B worth, the price would probably quadruple. Apple can't buy it all without sending the price up, people won't hand over all bitcoin for current market price.
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:31:05
Sorry man :(
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:34:17
Kinda hard to calculate. You can guess some are out of action because they are untouched after being mined years ago. Others may have been sent to incorrect addresses, burn addresses, or someone has lost them on HDD. Around the time I bought in I saw a mate on FB was trying to get an old HDD examined after he had formatted it a couple of times since mining. He says he had about 100 in a wallet file on it. Coins like that are lost and can effectively be excluded from market cap calculations, but it is still problematic to try and quantify it all.

People are legitimately going to deterred from getting in. They'll feel like they've 'missed the boat' if they know they were $13 early last year, and now $1300. If something went from 13c to $13, it is still in a range where people feel like they can own a decent amount of the thing. Read about 'cognitive bias' if you get a chance.

That was pretty similar to my experience with Coinjar too, except I got registered, verified and coins on the same day. 
I was in Victoria earlier this month and kinda disappointed by the lack of places to spend them at, but hopefully that changes soon! Thanks for being keen on spending the coins, not just hoarding them haha..

Thanks for the update. Please drop a line as the rest comes together... I haven’t been able to find this covered elsewhere, but is there a method to verify the randomness of the keys generated? I understand it is an open-source product, but is it possible to check my device is running a legitimate version of the software?

About 80% of my money is in bitcoin because I think it will appreciate further. But that aside, do you seriously think Bitcoin is a good alternative to PayPal on sites that are not offering discounts?
My bitcoin adventure took a few days longer than PayPal would have, cost me 2% extra on fees, about $40 in depreciation. You think that's good enough for consumers to want to change to it?

I see what you mean, but I think this implies that this app would be able to host and save a heap of different store details. Ie I can get a burger at one place, and using the same app I could get dessert across the road.
Websites can be hard to load on mobile screens. An integrated app like this would keep it simple for sellers and their customers. Familiar layout, for users. It'd already know their deets without having to load a creditcard or something else into a heap of different websites. Ie. it shits me off to no end entering my deets in Ebay, online bookstores, Amazon, when I am basically always trying to perform the same exchange; money for goods.
@_date: 2014-01-23 08:58:07

This gunna be like one of those things where they announce they've revolutionised something, when all they've done is made it available to Apple fanboys?
Video chat existed before Facetime, tablets were around before the iPad, mp3 players existed before the iPod... I can just imagine the smug announcement on their website, "We've made money digital" or something haha..
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:59:01
Trezor is fully open source. There is no required trust component, like Bitcoin. They say people can even change it if they want..
I get your point on a dodgy component being slipped into the supply chain. I don't know if anything is in use by Trezor about that, but it probably wouldn't be that hard to fix. Even if each one produced just had a serial number and could produce one of those 2FA codes that can be verified online.
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:51:27

Thanks mate. Merry Christmas to you too! 
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:27:34
That's really cool. It'd be great in fast food places / bars, or other places where there is bulk food/drink being produced. I personally can't see myself using it on a casual dinner out; I like the personal touch of some places. Great work, I would love to see an integrated system like this hit the mainstream.

Having a formal Western medical education doesn't just mean I get taught that pot = bad, big pharma = good. That's an amazing generalisation. There is actually a lot of work that goes into finding out the effects of marijuana (sometimes just the active compounds) on users. Even at my uni they are recruiting volunteers for this stuff. They want past users with twins for one study, and another where they administer the active compound, versus a placebo to test something else.
You've kindly assumed I'm "one of those people who hasn't looked into it". Not only is it something of interest to me, but it is something I have been required to learn about. I wrote a lengthy paper on THC and CBD as a part of my undergrad. I don't have any bias - I am not emotionally invested in pot use/prohibition. It sounds like you're the one trying to push an agenda based on a 15 min doco with a sick kid. Promoting pot is a pretty trendy thing to do these days - but suggesting that anyone with (any?) cancer use it over proven medicine is ignorant at best, dangerous at worst.
You've made a snap judgement about pot for cancer, like you've made a snap judgement about me. Watching a youtube video or two on pot is not a substitute for actual knowledge.

@_date: 2014-04-27 10:29:31
No way they would, or no way they could? Bitcoin is designed as a trustless system. There is no reason to trust an anonymous person/group who has a 10% stake in a currency. 10% is an insanely large amount. There has been no indication that any of their stake has been sold yet despite opportunity for a sizeable profit already.
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:24:38

@_date: 2014-01-16 16:04:32
Yeah that's a good point. Despite being one of the many 'bitcoin crashes' it only shed about 60% of price. The others saw about 75-90% lost in a day.

If Bitcoin is worth a fraction of its hype, an additional 5000 transactions per day shouldn't threaten it.

I was on a roadtrip through Melbourne last week and was pretty disappointed with the options there. I went on Coinmap, and nearly everything listed seemed a bit obscure and out of the way. I bought Bitcoin a few months ago and am still yet to make my first purchase with it :(
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:06:53
Those definitely are definitely good properties of bitcoin. But for the purpose of purchasing a phone, as an alternate to PayPal, it was just a hassle.

1000/455 = 220%. It's a legit way of framing it. The hashrate is 220% of where it previously was.

If you want, you could offer a % discount based on how much you save for receiving it in BTC over conventional payment methods?.. But yeah, I think that's the reality of it. It's still a very niche market. Good luck with it!

That's basically my narrative to this point too. What stopped me from selling today was the difficulty of getting my BTC onto an exchange. If I had sold then instead of resisting, I would have sold in the trough. My family got me to sell theirs (that they bought after hearing about my early wins) and made a little profit - but I've decided I will only part with mine in exchange for goods. That's what's going to give imcrease merchant adoption and BTC real intrinsic value, rather than just a game of 'guess the price a day from now'.
Day traders are hurting the intrinsic value of BTC and deterring potential users by making it so volatile.
No matter whether this investment pays off or not 10 years from now - we were bold enough to put some money in when cryptocurrency was basically unheard of in the mainstream. Although BTC is a few years old, I still feel like anyone involved now is a pioneer of sorts.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:56:43
Ah that's a pretty disappointing interview. He seemed to have a pretty superficial knowledge of it all, and didn't correct the interviewer when she said that Bitcoin was hacked. It has never been hacked, dodgy service providers have. And he didn't even point out that you don't even have to store it on an online service...
At least it got some publicity though :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:33:26
That's a pretty impressive and balanced article. Kudos for coming here too!..
Benefits of different emerging species will persist and those with disadvantages will not be passed on. I have a pretty Darwinian view of altcoins and bitcoin - they are building upon each others strengths to develop more robust and useful products.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:16:21
Thanks. I hope that didn't seem like a complete noob post. This has had me in a bit of panic. I keep seeing posts from people who have lost all their transfer to mining pools. Freaked me out.

0 BTC- I can't afford any yet. Until I have finished my uni degree, I won't be able to have time to have a decent job. Worst thing about life right now is knowing I will have a good wage when I am out of school, but in the meantime living without much financial freedom. Don't get me wrong, I know money doesn't buy happiness, but being without it is a bit of a bummer!.. My parents are super helpful in supporting me, but there's no way I'd ever accept their funds for anything other than a roof and food... *sigh* Big congrats to everyone who got in early! Make the best of it! To the moon! Haha :)

@_date: 2013-12-26 14:35:36
That's so true. I had to set everything up for my fam when they wanted to buy some, and even then they weren't confident enough to do it themselves so they wired me money to do it through my account.
I think the exchanges in a lot of countries are slow and daunting, especially for new users.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:04:13
It is just the price people are currently trading their coins at that reflects market cap. It doesn't mean that 1/3 of bitcoins have disappeared or anything.
