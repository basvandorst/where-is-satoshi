I make random 30 character passwords for every website, email account, bank account etc. (including random 30 character "secret answers", as if real answers are good security) and keep them all in a single encrypted backed up text file on my comp with an easy to remember 30 character password.  It's the only way man.

are you talking lose half short term or long term?
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:40:09
that's bleak man.  It can't be that bad
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:20:20
your life savings, really?
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:37:29
aaaand it just fell $5.  Ok, I'd better think this through a little more
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:03:57
How can you buy Bitcoins or convert your BTC to dollars to pay your bills if it's banned?  Are exchanges really going to accept payments and mail out checks and risk getting busted?
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:38:40
old news.  It's $495 now
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:21:06
it makes all your dreams come true
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:18:01
I don't trust them exchanges, or the banks for that matter

Need to borrow more bitcoins for investing.  I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a bitcoin today.
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:18:55
man you 401k snobs think you know everything
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:31:53
Appreciate the sound advice man.  I'll probably start with a few thousand $ and put in more each week.  I don't even know how to set up a wallet yet so I have a long way to go.
So why is it that a few days back people were saying Bitcoin is dead?  I looked back like 10 pages and didn't see anything about that.
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:35:27
dunno why people are downvoting you
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:18:30
true, it's rough watching your investment bleed dry for that long
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:14:31
my main concern is that the United Nations will outlaw BTC transactions and it will plummet to $0 overnight 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:26:15
hey man, you'll feel sorry you didn't put your life savings in when BTC goes up to $600 next week
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:15:24
Old news. It's $512 now.
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:43:34
no man, long term is 1 year+,  I'm just saying it's not fun to watch it spiral down every day for a month
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:23:33
c'mon bro, it's not analogous.  People need drugs, they can do without Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:06:11
tears of joy for yet another Bitcoin Millionaire success story?
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:40:19
haha yea, i guess BMWs aren't luxury anymore now that every house has two of them parked out front.  I can't believe common brands like Nissan and Lexus keep getting relabeled as luxury everytime they release a new model, that's pathetic
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:54:10
Ok, that's a scary thought.  You're bumming me out man.
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:17:24
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:28:13
sounds like a good strategy, thanks
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:24:48
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:50:35
hey man, words hurt you know
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:23:19
c'mon man, BMWs and Mercedes aren't that expensive
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:10:19
That's no good, my hair is my livelihood
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:49:09
idk man, I'm just saying a worldwide ban on BTC transactions is something that governments could easily pull off if they felt like it, and you know they want to.  Even if it's not enforced, the value of BTC will drop to near zero as only outlaws will use it
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:12:06
Holy shit, the sell price went up by $11 since I started this thread.  I could have made $15,000 dollars already.  Brb investing everything!!
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:18:57
you know it works lol
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:11:03
but why make $1 million when you could make $100 million?
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:08:49
Processing time, hmmm, that's no good.  So you can't lock in the current sell price, you just ask to sell and some hours later it sends you USD at the new price?  How long is processing time 
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:29:55
cool, thx
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:19:18
screw that shit, who actually pays taxes on Bitcoins anyway?
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:13:22
Carpe diem bro
