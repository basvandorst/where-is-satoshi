Eclair wallet is completely neglected.  Interface bugs, payments not going through even with direct channel and funds (to an Eclair node I might add), **and channels randomly closing costing me money just to maintain the ability to eventually pay**.  I don't trust their service if they can't even support their core public projects.  Did I mention their wallet is costing money to just have sitting active on my phone?...  I think they should focus on that before promoting their other shitty products asking users to trust them.
P.S.  What happens if they lose another key again but this time it's holding my money?

Active bugs:
"Channel forcibly closed and funds not returned
- opened on **Apr 5** by gustavonalle"
"[Mobile] Channel closed unexpectedly on app launch
- opened on **Apr 13** by dpad85 "
and many other open money-costing bugs still needing work...
*But hey, at least they released Strike!  Maybe they are making their node so poorly that you're happy to pay 1% to not have to use it directly.*

Can you guys work on an open source Lightning wallet?  The other one sucks pretty bad and you guys do such good work.

I hope you had multiple bottles prepared.  Drink often and drink happy, my friend.

If you want to see his censorship ethics in action, try saying "Bcash" to the spoiled d-bag's face and then see what happens.

I'm sorry for you.  You should find better.

I find it ironic that a company touting privacy is trying to grab information, such as my location, from my browser while reading about their alleged concern for privacy.

Under this scenario that they are offering, you wont have access to your lightning money and can't use it.

I used the following to get LND up and running 
I also got Eclair up and running:

Funny given their diagram on how it works.  It seems that a BTC transaction is just as fast (if not faster) then a lightning transaction.

Safe is relative.  I feel safe with $100 in the Lightning network, I do not feel safe with $5,000 just yet.  Maybe in a couple more months.
Fees, yes, you can earn sub-pennies being a small node.  Keep in mind the point of Lightning network is to make it be extremely cheap and fast to send money.

One reason for nodes closing can be that you need to move your Lightning balance in the channel back to the main BTC chain.  Same thing applies to the other end of the channel who you are connected with.  Both parties can close the channel at any time for any reason.  I would suggesting having at least three channels open spreading out your Lightning balance.  If you put all your balance on a single channel, who you're connected with can effectively send all of your funds out of the Lightning network if they decide to close the channel.  Then you lose your ability to spend in the Lightning network.  If you disperse it across a few channels, you should always have some to spend and have time to repair a closed channel.

So that's why they did cross-chain trading in lightning!
