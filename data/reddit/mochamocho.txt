[PSA] Don't install 3rd party apps without extensive research if you use your computer for managing wallets/bitcoin!

you need a cool website, official tour dates and a big donation address - get a music band manager to help you out. Edit: also get a nice paint job for the van, it must sparkle bitcoin :)

And the US Federal Reserve still prints more money per day (85 billion a month) than the bitcoin market cap.

You are not safe at all - If someone gains access to you account it doesnt matter how little you store on it, it will all be gone.
Maybe just hold as much in there as you usually carry USD in you pocket. If the value grows, withdraw to some cold wallet scheme..
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:08:17
just check the transaction if you don't believe me: 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:43:45
I even believe you. Hope you sold it in 2011 or 2012 not this year!

It was nothing against your app, just trying to make new users aware of the pitfalls of bitcoin euphoria..
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:28:54
Just sayin: Now is the time to buy..
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:52:56
That's after the logical conclusion dims on you that the only way forward is to be 100% invested in bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:52:24
 looks really good for futures

So that'd be 285MB/10mins or 41GB/day or around 1TB every 25 days. So with a recent 4TB harddrive you could store 100days of Visa's transaction volume. That's ~3.5 harddrives for a year worth of such transaction volume.

It looks like a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet. As such the private key printed on the paper is very strongly encrypted. (You can print them from bitaddress.org)
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:41:59
Your != you're.
Get it right! Say no to shitty grammar.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:06:55
Wrong! You don't read blockchain messages correctly - they appear above the transaction. So this guy only paid 0.0001BTC, the 136 BTC above are part of the seized coins.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:04:45
I really do support you guys!
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:43:33
Sorry, I meant OP's paper wallet
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:40:50
and give a 30% discount...
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:16:48
Oh, thank you very much!

This number is staggering: Only in China, only in the 3rd quarter, only for e-payments. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:29:13
thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:52:44
Be sure to include a transaction fee! Otherwise you'll have a bad time..

Graphics cards hash in the order of 50 to 1000 million hashes per second.
First ASICS did around 1000 - 10,000 million hashes, latest generations do 200,000 - 2000,000 million hashes per second. So roughly 1 good ASIC today can deliver the hashing power of ~500 modern graphic cards.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:55:48
Could be $5000 before long..
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:12:37
this is stupid reasoning.. just think in mBTC. 1 mBTC ist $0.36, wow that's your ticket to the riches pal.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:03:13
where is 1million and 10million?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:18:34
$37k is a very conservative estimate for the next 2 years only.

this is some shitty advice - what if the drop comes sooner than expected? what if your coins get lost or stolen? what if a bitcoin flaw is discovered and everyone abandons ship?
Even if this only has a slim chance to arrive you not only loose your liquid assets but you fuck yourself and your family too. Don't be stupid because it might work out.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:53:46
Just bought reddit gold for another redditor! Felt great :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:09:23
I got the magic solution for you: spend fiat. It's like you spend bitcoins only you replenish the exact amount instantly. You can do this via credit cards or paypal for example.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:10:39
Why are you scared, you surely made a profit and learned a lot about bitcoin in the last couple days - life is great!
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:09:33
As a 14 yo I would spend every dime I got on bitcoin and then some.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:16:57
its not illegal, not yet

I think you should try to read up as much on bitcoin as you can - reddit and bitcointalk are great resources, and on the web you find heaps more. Don't be concerned with profit, profit is stupid - it doesn't tell you wether to believe in something or wether you should keep holding a stake when things go awry..
Now here is the thing, once you start to understand and connect the dots you will be able to answer most of your questions yourself. In the meantime buy a bitcoin or two and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:34:22
You oversimplify and then refute your own oversimplifications. Facepalm.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:00:14
Just another warning - this could happen to btc-e or cryptsy as well - a hack or whatever and all your coins are gone. You have been warned over and over again, but greed for ever more seems to be strong within the community..
