Is it bad that I secretly wouldnt even mind if it completely collapsed in the low thousands just so I can stock up? I believe in the technology. It's not going anywhere.

How dare you, only Robin hood is the bestest ever! It's way better than that conbase. Literally only thing I've heard on any crypto sub for the last year.

Its bitcoin. Just bitcoin. No core. Period.

If he is.... I dont see how this is big news at all. Those are really shitty parameters. Other companies do way better than that.

Serious question... have you thought about just immigrating illegally? Just say your going on vacation and then just fly into Italy and take a train to Germany then apply for a Visa? Lots of others from Africa did it. Idk though. Not like I'm an expert here. I'm genuinely worried for you guys down there. If I was in charge America would be opening our doors for you.

Yeah that's what I'm thinking. Depending on the languages he "might" be eligible for certain things in the u.s as well.

Hmm, I never actually thought of this. This people tech savvy enough to use crypto arent gonna need help to fix a computer and if they do need help the computer is probably fucked and they will just buy a new one so you wouldnt ever run into anyone wanting to use it huh?

I'm wondering if he means cant withdraw more than 500 fiat after selling bitcoin and not withdrawing 500 worth of actual bitcoin.

That's pretty shitty. Would take forever to take any significant money out.

And do you know of any other crypto place that makes buying crypto easy in America? And when I say easy I mean I can literally download an app and use my debit card and not feel like I'm risking the company just running away with my money?

Conbase?? I assume you mean coinbase but other than the bch issue where did they go wrong?

Isnt this the same country that said "I dont know why we have poor people, we can just print more money?"
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:52:17
Longterm it doesnt though... it consistently goes up over time which makes people not want to spend it because they might lose out on future gains. If it was consistently stable, people wouldnt mind spending it. Me included.

So if America is so fucking awful why you using a american made site right now?

Do you speak Arabic? If you do the u.s military would take you right in. I know it would suck for 4 years but that's a ticket in if you wanted it. They need more people who can speak it since were constantly involved in the middle east. Also your degrees. Are the mathematical or science?

"Far proceeds anything of the past" yeah.. even if your exaggerated statement was true it's still not worse than the past. You know those times that if a king wanted a country he just invaded and slaughtered anyone who opposed him. Soooooo much worse than that.
