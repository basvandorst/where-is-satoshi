stop using google pliz. there are many alternatives (startpage, searx, duckduck go and my personal fav: qwant) 
privacy matters :)

because no one says he cares doesnt mean nobody does. true hodlers know sharing the amount of btc owned is potentially a security threat.
you wouldn’t want a hacker to steal your spot at the citadel would you?

Am holding on to the BTC I already have. 
Planned to buy a few days ago but was waiting for a price drop from 8,3k€ to 7,8k€ to buy. But instead it skyrocketed to 9,5k€.
should I buy now? wait for a correction?

anything to back up this claim?

predictions are inaccurate by definition and I have little knowledge. but i’ll still give it a try. 
think there will be a small rodeo just before halving but the big one will come 6-18months later and could reach 80-100k. then back to 20k for bearmarket.
15k EOY 2019
35k april 2020
25k july 2020
90k ATH may 2021
20k september 2021

the meme says « bitcoin gains »
not just « bitcoin ». 
socialists are not supposed to be into gaining and making profit as it is typically capitalist. bitcoin is decently socialist. using bitcoin only to profit is not socialist. 
first meme from this sub I like in a while.
