There could be disagreements on whether a transaction in the pool is the first one or the second one. I believe the mechanism to determine precedence is the blockchain. If this is really the case than there would be no way to accurately tell a first from a second transaction in the pool. The first transaction to get in the pool for one node might actually be the second one for another node, isn't?
One could imagine a scenario where a wallet is controlled by two different people. (Let's say, husband and wife). I believe that could be the case with two different wallet clients. Both make transactions in a 5min span. Then it would not be possible to say which one was first. Thus, the higher fee is first.

The text says paypal processed 1.4 billion dollars in the first quarter. Bitcoin processed over 11.1 billion in dollar value in the same period, isn't it?

No. There is only one private key.

Bitcoin has already disrupted banking as far as I am concerned.

This is an important point. Scaling is sure important, but it simply isn't true that instant confirmations are always that important.
Using blockchain.info wallet I frequently lower the fee they add because I am not in such a hurry. A new bitcoin user, one who has doubts about it's reliability will be very uncomfortable with the confirmation delay, but an experienced user probably won't.
Nevertheless some use cases for the need of instant confirmations could be:
- betting on events;
- cabs or buses (not a real issue right now);
- paying for occasional remote instant services that require payment upfront (for instance: nsfw services);
I'd also add that alt coins are also a scaling method for Bitcoin. Using dogecoin for microtransactions is actually a very comfortable way to deal with the issue. I'd like to see bitcoin scale to cover all cases, of course, but I really don't mind to use Doge for betting...
