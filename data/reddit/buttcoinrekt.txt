My new favorite wallet, Airbitz, does.

Hell yeah, these reporters are complete potato, but still great pub for Bitcoin and the impressive Airbitz crew. I just learned about Airbitz in past few weeks (I'm a butter and a lurker, so myeh). I am seriously enjoying bitcoin a lot more now that I use Airbitz. I might just become a Bitcoin Bieber Fan yet.

You can count on one thing: Rulers gonna rule and regulators gonna regulate.

Seriously, I saw the video and went straight to the [directory in the Airbitz app]( to check...  
Ummm, yeah. 431 listings in the City of SD alone. The idiocracy is on full display with network tv news.

I know, right? 
Bitcoin company but won't pay your employees in BTC? That's a buttcoin meme... (attn: the posers at CoinDesk)

A bitcoin company that "follows" a state's (province's) rule on privacy seems suspect, if not at least misguided. Privacy on the Internet is completely broken, so why is it a good idea to design a policy around the strictures of the parties (governments) who purposefully broke it?
Reasonable is a subjective term. Is it reasonable for regulators to regulate, even when they don't understand what they're regulating? A regulator (and their cheerleaders) would say so.
Come on, Coinkite. Aren't you better than that?

Their taxes are likely taken out before, just like with fiat, and then employees are remitted the net amount per period...
Can't avoid the tax man in the good ol' US of A...

What about your privacy policy? I'm sorry, but any paranoid privacy hound should be suspicious of this.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:27:16
I wonder if any letters like these ever get read. Even by a staffer...?

Exceptional. I love me some Chris Ellis.

Bitcoin Community, I ask you:
Would you rather know how much volume your provider is doing, or know that your provider _cannot_ know how much volume it's doing...?

This is stupid. The only thing that is keeping Bitcoin alive and thriving is bitcoiners. Here's how you kill Bitcoin: get everyone who is using it to stop using it.

The FBI is investigating themselves? What could possibly go right?

Moreover, a company/service that knows the volume it's transacting is not a friend of privacy, which means there are unnecessary security holes/vulnerabilities. Speaking of "privacy" here's their policy, see (e):
_We use personal information collected from you in order to: (a) associate you with your account and validate your identity; (b) provide or deliver products, software and/or services to you and, if applicable, collect payment for same; (c) communicate with you about our products, software and services or your use thereof; (d) resolve problems, disputes or legal claims; (e) enable third parties to provide you products, software or services that support our products, software or services or that you request; and (f) develop, improve, market and promote our products, software and services. We only retain your personal information for so long as it is required for such purposes._

Well, I look forward to a follow up blog post about any replies Airbitz gets. Will be interesting.
