The fact that company immediately converts BTC to Fiat doesn't imply their motive is just to use BTC acceptance as a free advertisement.
Sometimes, a business which wants to participate in the BTC economy, must convert to fiat. This is especially true if a company is shipping a tangible good since the costs for manufacturing and shipping those goods are nearly always denominated in Fiat.

Not always like this at all. For a substantial period of time, GPU mining was profitable. Depending on who you placed your bets with at the start of the ASIC era, you could have scored big. I paid 7 coins for 2nd gen Knc Jupiter, which was relatively late in the game compared to the previous knc machines, and so far it's paid back over 40 coins and still nets a profit of about $50 a day.

Actually, E-Junkie totally doesn't meet our needs, as it doesn't integrate Bitcoin payments. We're constantly pushing E-Junkie Support to include Bitcoin, to no avail. We have a very roundabout method of accepting btc right now and it's bad.
But consider that if we have 1500 sales a month with an average of $30 per sale, we would be paying $225 per month according to the pricing calculator on the FoxyCart website. Meanwhile, E-Junkie would cost us $5 per month, and is the same service minus BTC acceptance.

Speaking for ZenMagnets.com, I can say that 100% of our bitcoin sales have remained in bitcoin. But that's because we understand the potential, and bitcoin sales are a relatively small portion of our overall sales.

No, I don't at all know what you mean. According to the sidebar, Bitcoin is the currency of the internet. You have bitcoin. Therefore your bitcoin posts are related to your finances. If you're saying that you don't want to disclose your personal intentions and investment strategies, it seems you've already been doing that all along in most of your other posts. You say you don't care about BCH, but then you must care about BTC? In which case, the non-action of ignoring your BCH has an opportunity cost to BTC.

Most of your post is spot on. Faster confirmations? No big deal. Flaw in bitcoin? Likely to affect Litecoin similarly. But there is one main reason that Litecoin does deserve some attention, that people always forget to mention:
Equitably. The distribution of bitcoin is heavily skewed towards the few people who were first figuring this stuff out. The fact that bitcoin was first means fewer people were present for initial mining. By the time Litecoin started, people already had an idea as to how crypto economy might work. And that it's blood is made of Scrypt, instead of SHA256, has also allowed for much long term equitable mining. Everyone who is mining LTC has payed roughly the same per hash rate, via desktop GPUs.

99% Positive it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:26:52
I read this response 7 hours ago, but there was just something bugging me that I Must respond to regarding litecoin. To me, the most important difference between bitcoin and litecoin is NOT the increased security of faster block creation, or it's use of scrypt which is ASIC resistant, but this:
It's inception was much more equitable. There were not people buying trading large quantities of it at 60,000 times it's current value at the beginning. 
The initial miners were plentiful, and were all CPU miners, and generally had an understanding of a more established cryptocurrency ecosystem. These three factors, together, leveled the playing field in a sense, and created much fewer super rich individuals (such as yourself if you don't mind) than bitcoin. Compare this to Bitcoin, where many coins were transferred (and lost) during the phase in which the whole thing was considered an experiment. Some people would say the effect would be BTC being more volatile. But that's just a nicer way of saying that a greater portion of the market cap is in the hands of the BTC ultrarich.
So.. of course you would be against Litecoin. It's success negatively affects your (massive) wealth.

Difficulty has indeed been increasing, but so has price, which was the entire point of the logarithmic graph of bitcoin price compared to mining difficulty as Profit is denominated in US dollars, not BTC. Up until July 2013, the two had been growing at very similar rates.
Still, your example demonstrates well that .63 is too high of a number for fixed periods beginning currently. And break even will depend on the rise of bitcoin price.

risky to hold. Bitpay and coinbase can remove this risk for merchants.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:44:47
Your concern is valid, and most of the answers people are giving you are speculative. Full nodes are absolutely necessary for the health of the bitcoin network. And if we're really going to dream about bitcoin one day representing 1% of online transactions, then I hope there's a better answer than "Moores law".
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:36:52
I tried to buy some, and the seller verified the BTC with the website, but then cancelled because the exchange rate rose.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:39:47
Not that simple. BTC-E has always been a bit lower than GOX because of the fees to move USD in and out.

That the bitcoin economy is still rather small. Of the 40k readers of this subreddit, maybe 1% have used bitcoin to purchase something.

I'm not so sure ISP's would be the easiest target. The exchanges would be much easier target, since it's easier to stop fiat flow than data flow.

Button cell batteries kill much faster than magnets when swallowed by a child. And the CPSC has itself admitted that magnet spheres are more useful and less dangerous than balloons. Don't let the US Government control your perception. 
Magnets should be respected, not feared.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:56:01
Because once the government loses control if it's currency, auditing is the only real method it will have to get it back. Besides restricting transfers between banks and exchanges.

Nothing's changed, and we're one of last fighting the US Authorities.
Buckyballs gave up because:
1. They had the most ingestion incidents, because they put them aside board games and rc helicopters in stores. (They didn't respect the magnets.)
2. They never had the right to use the name "buckyballs" in the first place, and their trademark was contested by the buckminster fullerene estate.
Most of the other companies that sold magnet spheres quit because it's expensive to disagree with the US Government.

Bitmit is great. Still a little bit fresh on the capability side, but they're making good progress.

Looks like their shopping cart system could be used along-side ours. Off the top of your head, what others?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:11:57
People send less letters, but people also do more online shopping. In fact, if you were to ship a package, USPS is almost guaranteed to be the best value for the speed. You'll never find UPS or Fedex shipping flat rate packages for $5.

Oh, sorry, forgot to include vital info. We only recently listed on coingig, but listed the same thing on bitmit over two months ago without a bite. Perhaps the entire site doesn't have more traffic, but there are also fewer listings on coingig so more eyes per product?

Zen Magnets converts 0% of bitcoin payments back to Fiat. We're in it for the long run, and we're fortunate to have enough fiat-flow to be able to.
However, one current problem is the [Zen Magnets Bitcoin Set]( that was released on Bitcoin Black Friday. They are still for sale, but the included BTC incentive is now much lower in value, but the price ($40) has remained the same.

Not sure what you mean by "over". More exchanges (includeing huge ones like oanda) means the market is bigger better faster.

If our costs were denominated in Bitcoin, it would be easy to price at Bitcoin. The reality however, is that almost all tangible and human resources are tied to fiat values.
 
If we set the price in BTC now, our magnets would become too expensive once the price of BTC rises. And if the BTC falls, we could take a loss. 
BTC volitility, therefore, is a great risk to a merchant. Once raw resources, human labor, and other dependent services are priced in bitcoin, then we will gladly serve a static bitcoin price. Until then, you're just not being realistic.

The post office isn't near bankruptcy because of email. It's because of politics. Mainly that Congress wants USPS to fund retirements for employees they don't have yet.

It's probably a decision based solely on risk.
