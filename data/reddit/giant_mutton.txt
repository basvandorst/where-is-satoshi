**2**) Bitcoin futures triggering pychological trading barriers which results in negative self-fulfilling downwards selling pressure as traders "try to stay ahead of the curve" to make money, which snowballs into more negative sentiment as the price goes down 
**3**) Ratings agencies selling BS, which too has worked by improving/supporting marketcap of the "B" tokens and crashing the others 
**4**) We also have a coordinated effort to demonize "storage of value*" (the key function of Bitcoin) with a focus on dapps as the solution which is fraud as we also need tokens that best fulfill a role of money, which these dapp based chains do not do
* Storage of value in the purest sense is money that a) retains value over time and b) increases in value over time (deflationary). This is why Gold is a tier 1 asset despite never being used to buy groceries, coffee, entrance fees to clubs or pay bills. Storage of value rates higher than medium of exchange, otherwise fiat would be considered better than gold but it isn't, (it's trash for storing wealth e.g. housing, healthcare and food all increasing comparatively) but makes an excellent medium of exchange - the functions are seperated. As long as Bitcoin can be exchanged for fiat, it could work just as well as gold purely as a vehicle for storage of value with the exchange function deferred to fiat, or maybe it can do BOTH! But calling it obsolete is a complete fucking joke and is purely an attack

Trader emotional sentiment, psychology and self-fulfilling price action as a result of futures pricing - where people try to "stay ahead of the market" to make profits.
A number of Traders (as a collective) will buy/sell in accordance with futures pricing which gives institutions some level of control of where the market moves. If they want the market to go down, they set the futures prices lower and traders will trade in sync with this pricing mechanism.
All these institutions (such as the CME) can over a period of years influence the Bitcoin market which ever way they want using their futures pricing and because they have a bias to protect legacy banking systems they will obviously work against Bitcoin over the longterm.

The institutional investors will be funneled into fiat copies of Bitcoins, also known as derivatives (referred to as "shares" in the OP's link).
If enough liquidity enters the derivatives market, then the price swings in these derivatives of Bitcoin will influence the price of the real Bitcoin tokens as well. That is the aim - to try and get more control. Remember: bitcoin competes with legacy central banking systems.
This is how they manipulate precious metals. They dump shitloads of fake fiat paper gold "shares" onto the market and this sends the price of real bullion tumbling with it.
If these bankers truly loved Bitcoin they would make the llaws more accommodating to allow institutions to buy real Bitcoins instead of fiat copy "shares".
I think enough people desire the real tokens and doubt they will ever get control of Bitcoin.
