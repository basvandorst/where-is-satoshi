I was thinking of that. If governments can do what China did last week what can one dude with 1 bi do to the price? And one hedge fund with 5 bi? Will bitcoin be safer for ordinary people then stock markets or not? For ordinary people stock markets are a big risk already

I think people will adopt online wallets. Look at all the desktop to online e-mail transition. Who, in 1995, would think people wold leave all their personal e-mail online forever? I love the "be your own bank" thing but that is not a demand that came from the general public.
But online wallets will not be "the browser" to Bitcoin because there are other issues form mass adoption so thank you for addressing the mass adoption topic

First of all, thank you. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying we should celebrate it, of course not. Just that the news seems more reliable than all the "ban exchanges" news from the last week. But OK, now I understand it. Edit: typo

I'm with you 
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:40:43
I can't see any reason. IMO, there are only two things that could stop bitcoin: people and governments.
Ordinary people can't understand cryptography, public/private keys, seeds, blockchain, p2p, mempools, nodes etc. But all this can already be presented to people in a way they can use: online wallets. I know it's not the most recommended today and I know there are some improvements that online wallets still must make for massive adoption but ordinary people will adopt online wallets as they become more and more user friendly like they adopted gmail, whatsapp etc.
About governments, please se this: 
Edit: well, fees can influence ordinary people too but there are already solutions like LN, so...

3 and 4 I think we will resolve soon. I can see people sending a small amount of money from a hardware wallet on Sunday to a software wallet on a phone and using it for the week. And I can see people understanding Bitcoin like they did with e-mail about 10 years ago. What I can't see is people storing all their life savings on a hardware wallet. I agree with all other topics

IMHO, Bitcoin can facilitate microcredits for a huge amount of people that can't access banks directly or other financial institutions with high interest rates
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:04:37
I know people are making fun of this today but have you seen this?
There are a lot of ways people can access bitcoin without exchanges 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:12:27
Thank you. But can't they make ones life miserable for years? Will there be a time when Bitcoin is even stronger than stock markets or it will be forever even more concentrated than stocks are today. Sorry my english
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:23:36
Yes. From Google documentation: "It's this paymentResponse object that contains the user's payment information that you'll submit to your payment processor". 
So it's good news but then one will need something like bitpay or  I think, don't know for sure yet

Most people here don't care about economics and fundamentals. They believe and that's OK. Well, I don't care too but I like it. I like to understand and talk about it. There are many things that can trigger deflation. Recently we have different cases like Greece and Japan. Bitcoin is another case as it won't be trigger by dept like Greece and it will not have central bank printing money. It's a complex topic and English is not my first language. I suggest you start reading Wikipedia and go from there search the internet. I wish I could help more. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:57:53
Thank you for the post. My father has 74 and is an economist too. He has studied from Marx to Brexit and he is very open minded, does Tai Chi, Yoga etc. I did't presented him the technical details, none of them, I didn't even mentioned the name Bitcoin. I just said, if you like I can stop and explain every single technical detail to you with pleasure, but suppose a digital money, suppose a public and distributed database on Internet that everyone can see, suppose that the database is only written when a true transaction can be proved, suppose a finite deflationary amount of money etc.
Of course he did't got it right away but being good with abstractions he liked the idea and started seeing real world applications like micro credits.
Now, IMHO, different people will adopt Bitcoin for different reasons. I can see a lot of young people just jumping in because Bitcoin is their thing, because their friends are all using it etc. I can see a lot of housewife jumping in because their favorite artist said on TV that he/she is using it etc. I can see a lot of shop owner thanking Bitcoin for the overall low feed compared to credit cards, debit cards, banks etc. Of course, as with Internet, older people will have a longer learning curve but they will get it eventually.

The Blockchain protocol already regulates Bitcoin better then any law, lawyers, fiscal specialists etc. could do
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:53:15
Yes, and if the protocol can be ruled by a few CEOs, what's the point? We're back to fiat and banks 
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:22:15
Thank you, so for people who can't afford to lose... it's not recommended yet
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:52:04
P2P wont save Bitcoin by it self. It may save Bitcoin from death but it can't save Bitcoin from isolation (napster, piratebay etc.). Bitcoin needs mass adoption, Bitcoin need ordinary people adoption. Bitcoin must become way more user friendly before that. LN is the most promising solution right now, IMO
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:04:45
The only question in the banking system today is: how to bailout 2? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:38:44
Here is your debate.

"A short sell contract made in October and due december, essentially allows you to sell the coins you would have mined in November and December at October's price, 6K a piece"
I'm sorry, I understand short selling but never did it really. My question is, if the price is falling since January, who would buy in  December, with the price of October and why? Thank you
Edit: typo 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:27:04
Thank you, English is not my first language but I think I got it. Miners are buying they're own coins. Of course they don't need to buy but they need to return them to the owner. So then they can get mined coins from December with the price of October. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:58:21
But miners will only short to cut losses. It is not in they're best interest to short. So, there must be someone else shorting and really making money out of it. Right? I mean, I don't know...
