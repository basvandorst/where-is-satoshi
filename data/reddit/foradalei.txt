If you have a Greek friend tell them about coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:34:13
If you know any irl, tell them to tell their families :)
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:48:57
edit: Coinbase doesn't do that tho.. when you use their service, you have to accept their policy.
if you want to gamble or dnm, just source your btc elsewhere...

    === spamfilter ===
    This is a policy change that improves the spam filtering capabilities of Bitcoin
    Core, notably including pattern matching for notorious spammer scripts.
    Specifically, spam created by the following are identified and ignored:
    - BetCoin Dice
    - Correct Horse Battery Staple
    - Old spammy Counterparty encoding (NOT current versions of Counterparty)
    - Lucky Bit
    - Mastercoin
    - SatoshiBones
    - SatoshiDICE
And this is why people do not like you.

Good luck with the sale, its really a dreams house. Nice choosing being paid by bitcoin .

Just buying the coins would be a btter investment, otherwise invest on a mining company like activemining, check their thread a bitcointalk forum.

Think about running a full node: 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:36:02
512mb but they use ssd disks, which can easily handle the traffic without making the vps crash

Words from DPR from silkroad:
Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go.  Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well.  They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay  we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty.
There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well.  Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming.  What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life.  I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another. 
I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause.  I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter.  If you haven't read it yet, please do.  Here is the link:
The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart.  I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.
Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain.  And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.  Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms :)
Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.

Sir you just went full retarded...


So what?


So its a scam?


Can this even be called a bussiness experience? - I call it stalking and finding nothing.


Yea right. He made the deal with eAsic, so... yea.


He's an engeneer, not a PR guy.. and he's hiring a full time PR


Who said his looking to sell? Again.. FUD.


The dividends would be higher if Avalon didn't fucked up... actm had a 900Btc order on avalon chips

@_date: 2013-12-03 04:45:13
Scratch litecoin and write primecoin
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:35:30
look, if you rent a VPS, this is not a problem. A problem would be running the node from your on/off computer with a shitty connection.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:45:19
What about bips.me?

@_date: 2013-11-09 02:52:50
Why not keep them in both places? Sf and github
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:17:35
it only costs 5$... and ur helping the network grow more resistant. You can also run a full node from your computer but its a bit resource intensive.
Hope you like the guide.

I have been uploading around 1.5 terabytes per month, this month i did 2. Im using a vps on digitalocean. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:27:14
Would suggest you to invest in some primecoins, litecoins are just a btc copy and bring nothing new to the table
