If you smash your phone, please recycle it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:36:37
Mine was hacked as well. I never made any purchases with it and never gave it access to any of my money luckily.
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:16:48
Agreed. I would rather see them grow than get raided by Feds.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:01:10
whats weird is the transaction id that Hive is giving me is for a different amount than was sent. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:53:41
Just to play devils advocate. What would happen if someone started a bitcoin exchange for ios only that purchases coin through apples payment system? I suspect it would be taken down but it could be an interesting litmus test to see what their reasoning is.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:56:33
No just speculation and corp espionage. Maybe higher than 1080p screen. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:01:50
Interesting. I was looking at the S4 originally because I could get the big zero lemon battery for it so I'm not having to go from charger to charger.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:31:58
Ah ok. So coinkite isn't exactly for people like us who have used the original wallet app and such. People would use this coinkite wallet over something like armory or blockchain.info or coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:11:16
The galaxy is unlocked or the nexus?
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:31:25
Mine says received but under the amount it says pending confirmation.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:09:42
I once described the exchanges like this "imagine if the stock market was open 24/7, the buyers are jumpy and react to every rumor and article but there is only one stock and more than one exchange"
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:31:46
Can you PM that address?
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:47:40
I just wish I could have an android trial run of a galaxy4 or nexus 5 beforehand. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:01:02
But the card is a cool bonus. Hopefully some coinkites start showing up around me. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:02:27
Awesome, I havn't heard anything about bither. What upsets me right now is there are no businesses near me that accept bitcoin so I never get a chance to really use any mobile wallets. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:21:18
It's like road bandits getting mad at the caravan for using a different road so they don't get robbed.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:08:19
Fuck. I really don't want to switch to android.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:48:11
Ah ok. I might sign up once places have the reader then. $10 a month is a bit much for something I can't use yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:55:47
No just rumors, possible announcement on the 24th
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:38:46
Indeed. I just wish I had a chance to use these for transactions, but that is a different matter all together.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:57:03
Now development needs to start. If I get bored I might try to figure out how to develop this as a web app. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:00:08
I would like to see the various groups in Colorado attempt to make a circular economy with bitcoin.
Grower accepts bitcoin
Shop sells for bitcoin
Shop pays grower in bitcoin
Grower buys supplies with bitcoin either directly or gift cards / exchanges. 
They might be the first to do it as the banks are creating an incentive to do it. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:13:51
This is like bitcoin all  on my phone. Some day I'll have to settle one one. Looks awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:35:45
Great. Any chance the google play store will start removing bitcoin apps like apple?
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:25:34
can you explain it in simple terms what advantage coinkite provides? I still don't get why anyone would use it over a phone wallet so you can just scan a QR code and send bitcoin from it. I mean we all already have phones so all that is needed is software, coinkite requires cards and readers to be distributed. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:23:46
What are people's thoughts on the trezor?
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:26:10
Ugh I know.
Annoying as the IRS's stance on bitcoin is, at least it's well written and won't change day to day.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:36:53
Because those materials can be used to make a new android phone.
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:49:33
NFC? no thank you. Its flawed technology that cannot be trusted. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:34:31
I should probably put them on the front wheels so it's obvious to people that I'm ridding in the bike lane and not ahead of it
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:57:25
It's pissing me off. China needs to get their story straight. How can anyone comply with laws when they change day to day
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:21:31
I thought about doing something similar by stamping or carving a brass plate. Not because zombies though.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:25:33
How the hell do you attach lanes to a bike?
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:28:43
If the Galaxy S5 is awesome ill switch to tmobile and get that
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:05:37
Ah I was not aware of that, I thought miners were processing the whole blocks. Learn something every day. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:37:56
Interesting. I hope the core devs know what they are doing when upgrading to 8mb blocks. Seems that by increasing these sizes it will mean that only bigger asics will be able to process the blocks which will bring us closer to a 51% attack. Wish we could figure out a small solar powered aurdino type machine that could mine not for profit, but for blockchain integrity. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:11:59
When did this coin validation shit start?
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:52:50
So you're saying that no one on the exchanges are buying bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:21:38
ok. off topic but do you have any interest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:14:16
well go to your town's website and donate some mBTC so they can hit their renovation goal. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:52:33
I will, I just wish there was a way for solo miners to make some coins to incentivize mining to decentralize the block chain. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:49:21
Well I'm pissed at myself because I had the mining software installed in late 09 then after gpu mining started but I saw 0 coins and didn't see the big picture because the only place you could spend coins was so limited and had nothing worth spending them on.
I'm late to the game but I have a butterfly labs 5gh/s running. I'll probably never see an roi but it's fun. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:39:37
Dang, limit number of supported banks.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:30:05
agreed. We were discussing a much wider discussion of the future of bitcoin and how it would be difficult for the government to conduct an audit on you and seize your assets. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:07:46
ah that's cool and makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:38:35
I agree, I was laughing while reading it which is why I posted it. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:52:54
I know what you're saying, just people shouldn't except an instant exchange between the two yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:28:09
that requires a very specific chair size doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:31:35
ok so I stand corrected. The point i'm trying to make though is that while the exchange exists, the infrastructure isn't there to facilitate trading as easily as the stock market. You are right there are not millions of coins trading hands at the moment but it's unfair to say there are basically 0 buyers. 
Personally I might take 1 paycheck in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:04:00
How easy is it to do? Iv tried a couple of time and haven't gotten it to work. I tell it to take a photo for a QR code and try to fill the frame with the code and it still doesn't work right. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:21:47
I agree for the most part but if the US gov starts to tax bitcoin and confiscate funds/ prosecute bitcoin users then it could effectively kill bitcoin in the USA. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:23:15
Thats kind of a mixture of fair and unfair assessments. Bitcoin can hold value like a stock share yes but its also a very young market. Attempting to sell 100BTC right now could roughly be like saying you can't find anyone to buy 24571 shares of Amazon stock within an hour in 2001 which was about 3 years into the company being public. Investors also have to go through more loopholes right now with currency exchanges. Coinbase is more like the market as you can directly purchase and sell coins to and from your bank account while places like bitstamp require you to deposit using money orders and the like. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:37:27
Online part time work? I'm trying to find some frontend web work to do for bitcoin pay.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:55:47
I remember seeing it go from 30cents to zero after panic selling. It will go back up. Just spend a few bitcoin and keep the faith. The first btc purchase was a $20 pizza for 10,000 btc, that pizza costs 0.02 so keep your chin up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:45:01
Can I test my bank code and routing number here too? Need to make sure it's secure
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:18:45
Allow me to rephrase. If I were to get an android phone I wool get one that's unlocked so I can put the latest android version on it rather that some carrier specific fork of the OS. This would mean buying a phone without contract so something like an Xperia Z would cost me $800 plus. 
I'm happy with iOS 7 on my iphone 5 but look forward to my contract ending with AT&amp;T next September so that I can switch to someone like TMobile. 
That being said, I haven't been impressed with android enough to run out and switch phones or attempt to root my iphone to put android on it.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:17:06
that's he's doing right? isn't the coinbase helpdesk?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:43:57
Like you'd ever see an roi on these. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:41:47
Odd, I see it now too. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:56:50
Iv been thinking of saving up for a knc gen3 if they ever come out. Knc miners are going for like $10k on eBay which is well out of my budget.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:15:21
He gets about 30BTC a day with that thing I hear. and his power bill is roughly $2000 a day. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:43:47
I know it was a very vague and inaccurate comparison. By faith in a stock I mean't more that the investors have faith that the company won't have a scandal or that public perception/demand for electric vehicles change which would cause the company to lose money and eventually be unprofitable. 
Yes Bitcoin has nothing behind it except people believing in it, I guess add myself to that list as i've drank some of the punch. Back in 2010 though I was like "why would I buy/mine this stuff? so I can buy stuff on bitcoinstore.com? I can already buy stuff online and at the store in cash". 
Will the trade value of btc ever level out so people feel comfortable using it as a currency? who knows really. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:22:16
I've heard that mtgox is no longer the go to exhange for bitcoin, any specific suggestions?
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:18:35
Coinjar anyone? It's well designed and works well. Blockchain.info wallet works in safari with html5. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:28:41
I'm sorry 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:47:47
100 coins in a week or two? possibly it depends on which exchange. You could sell them for CNY then convert that to USD. 
possible but unlikely on MTGOX. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:40:39
I'm not saying that such a thing is possible within such a tight timeframe. But it can be done over a longer time period. Give bitcoin another year and the trade volume should increase drastically. Bitcoin isn't just another public company on the NASDAQ, its a completely different market that less than 10% of the world population knows about. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:54:50
The community will never go for this. They would have to create some bitcoin fork which would mean it would die almost instantly due to user base of "0". 
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:18:34
One complaint that is valid depending on political ideals is that bitcoin. Is hard for government audits and prevents the gov for enforcing taxes on citizens and transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:58:33
I understand. I was just meaning that having a fixed protocol in place can be more stable than allowing a group of individuals to change policy. The market fluctuates every time the Federal Reserve makes some changes such as increasing or decreasing interest rate. I personally have never seen any currency that is attached to an unchanging protocol. That is what makes bitcoin interesting to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:02:44
I hope so, as much as bitcoin excites me I'm still cautious. Governments are wielding big hammers when it comes to currency and they are willing to swing as hard as they want. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:29:00
Every problem they list sounds like an advantage to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:09:59
this is making me depressed. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:46:18
I'm more concerned with it being a web wallet with data stored on a server. Web wallets are targets because of the concentrated value compared to an offline wallet or a secure wallet like Armory wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:45:20
That's ok, I really didn't think about that question when I wrote it, same as any % off discount. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:27:51
I can see them also requiring to see how many bitcoins are in each address to also charge a whitelisting tax as per government requirement.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:32:43
i'm waiting for direct metal printers to begin printing paper wallets in bronze so that you can store your private keys without having to worry about them getting damaged from physical abuse or water damage. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:15:32
I would suggest asking this on @_date: 2013-11-18 14:23:20
Yeah. This arms race for mining coins is a little worrying though. Block chain decentralization and security depends on miners so what happens when there are no more coins to earn and people shut down the asics so all you have left are a few small pools and cloud hashing controlling the chain?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:43:09
I'm more concerned with businesses using this. Months from now they decide to accept bitcoin and they see ads saying that it's the most trusted service among business professional. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:41:25
wonderful. Im just wondering what will happen as the difficulty increases, will the number of miners decrease and in turn cause bitcoin to become more centralized?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:39:18
That's exactly what I was thinking while I read it. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:17:56
So basically they are trying to attach a centralized point of control onto a decentralized currency?
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:11:28
It's a risk similar to investing in the stock market. People investing in Tesla have faith that the value of the investment will increase over time while other people believe it's overvalued and will only return a lose. 
People buying / mining bitcoin right now have faith that their investment will increase in value over time or that in the future bitcoin will become accepted more places. Obviously a majority of retailers that accept BTC are converting them to USD in the exchanges with systems like bitpay but there seems to be the hope that in future bitcoin could be accepted by supplies and further down the economic chain to the point where it isn't converted to USD. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:09:05
i'm sorry
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:31:01
ok i was just wondering what your stance on it in general was.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:04:42
so just to clarify, you're saying if you went to someplace like localbitcoin, mtgox or bitstamp then you wouldn't be able to sell any of your coins because there are no buyers? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:12:04
np. Are you physically buying the physical cards and then just recording them to a database or do you have it all happening digitally?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:17:31
I hear ya. I just haven't had the need to use bitcoin on the go yet. If tmobile offers to pay my cancelation fee then possibly android?
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:27:37
What's your feeling on campbx with requiring money order deposits to keep it anonymous?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:03:40
I'll probably run a simple USB sized miner later on just to contribute to the block chain. Right now I want to buy some coins to tuck away to protect myself from USD risk. Should have mined and sold second life real estate, hope I don't miss the second profit opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:45:05
There was but it was removed by apple for allowing financial exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:02:25
Btc is like the stock market with a bit more insanity. There is only one company and the exchange is open 24/7 and is world wide and everyone is a day trader. Don't step into this madness with more money than you can play with. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:47:55
I agree with you on all points. I only ask because iv looked at buying bitcoin as well but I'm not sure if it's worth it yet for me. Do you plan to convert all of your USD income to bitcoin or do you have a ratio like 1/3rd of your income will be put into BTC? Iv been watching BTC for years but my interest recently peaked with the fiasco in Cypress. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:26:59
And most of America is asleep.
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:45:47
How will they know they are getting the right amount for taxes as you can't audit bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:11:36
any chance of a Firefox version?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:14:22
what crash?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:26:59
It was removed. Iv used the CoinJar app and it does what I need. I store pocket change worth in it though, they will be adding paper wallet import support soon I believe. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:13:53
as cool as this is, I'd advise against storing any large sum of bitcoin in a web wallet like coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:39:30
I'll check when I get home.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:45:45
Didn't the Weimar Republic cause inflation by just printing more banknotes? The bitcoin protocol prevents this from happening and we know specifically when bitcoins will stop being rewarded(2140).
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:48:06
Out of curiosity, if you're going to buy bitcoins, why not just use that money to buy things rather than going through the trouble of using bitcoin?  
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:52:03
How are they offering so much off? Hoping to make a profit by siting on coin?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:14:14
Except no iphone app sadly
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:20:40
No I don't trust NFC at all.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:32:25
I'll take a look at Campbx again. I setup bitcoin mining in 2009 and then got bored of it when it had issues. If only I had toughed it out and kept going. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:36:13
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:45:05
Interesting. I've suggested replacing taxes with a donation type system so that public funding can be used as a form of voting. Like I personally would not donate to subsidize oil companies and other such government programs while I would donate toward clean renewable energy. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:34:26
So you don't feel that bitcoin has any value even as a test bed for decentralized currency that isn't issued or controlled by a government?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:59:16
Well I'm including andoid in that vague statement.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:08:31
Agreed, I'm just bringing up other peoples concerns.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:34:30
I'm not talking your wallet, I'm talking USD bank accounts as well. Even if they can't get into a wallet they can still cause enough headache eventually where you wouldn't benefit from bitcoin. 
Long story short, the gov worries me. Hiding money from thieves is sure to piss them off.
On a side note, I'm waiting for prices to stabilize so people feel comfortable spending coins rather than exchanging for USD. What good is a currency of people only treat it as a way to get a different currency.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:32:08
So this congressional hearing could cause the price of bitcoin to go through the floor if it sounds like the gov is going to put controls on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:31:17
you're looking for a Bitcoin sugar daddy?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:51:09
I would prefer to switch over to firefox OS. Havnt seen any Google phones I care for.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:32:27
In support of your little BTC business I've purchased a card from you. I hope to figure out a BTC business for myself soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:41:20
15% of your income? So treating bitcoin like a savings account of sorts?
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:36:06
I would say owning some to start with. I've talked to people about bitcoin and they really were not interested until I gave them a paper wallet with some mBTC on it. They were one of the share holders once that had that wallet, the number game became important to them. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:47:51
If there were no buyers then it wouldn't be holding at $860 a coin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:40:21
I'm actually waiting to see what new phones will come out in the next year. Bigger iphone? More flex phones like the LG flex, curved screens?
Iv looked at the MotoX but it didn't have the hardware specs I was looking forward to. 
I want to get my hands on the LG Flex but it hasn't come to the states to my knowledge. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:45:20
I'm trying to buy coins but coin base takes weeks to get you the coins
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:06:15
So it sounds like they won't be using bitcoin as currency which is bad if true.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:54:47
I think for a while no one would donate as a way to save money but then they would see stuff start to fall apart like roads, bridges and so on and figure out that they need to throw in a bit. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:57:08
I'm willing to mine to support the block chain  but it seems past the point to buy $8k in hardware. It would be nice to make like $100 a month as a side income.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:56:06
which guy? Keiser or Jones?
