no-one knows. Dont listen to people like this they dont know any more about the price than anyone else.

I do use GDAX but it takes a week to get bank transfer.

haha congrats. Used the last of my money to buy ETH earlier today.

I buy 5 dollars everyday no matter the price. And i also buy a couple hundred worth when the price is right. Over time it will accumulate.

In stocks and crypto when it goes up it's called a bull and when it goes down it's called a bear.

GDAX fees are 0 if you do a limit order.

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:07:52
I know that GDAX has a limit buyer and seller
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:51:18
no GDAX takes care of the fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:53:37
Im currently waiting for my GEMINI account to be reviewed 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:01:25
Buying everyday

Thank you. Merry Christmas to you too.

Gemini has a 4-5 Bank Transfer time and the fees are very similar to GDAX around .25%. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:06
i have a reoccurring transaction set up on coinbase but the fees are terrible. are there any better options or other exchanges that accept credit cards? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:46:27
If you look at the previous dips it has always gone up alot
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:44:45
Merry Christmas! ��

People bought before the fork now that its canceled they are getting out 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:00
this is insane 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:24:06
When would be a good time to buy. Will it go down a little after this new ATH?
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:33:25
No one knows. Just hodl and you will make more money.
