Is this picture doctored? There's an active campaign of lies by anti-bitcoiners, so you have to be careful not to believe everything you see or read.
Edit: My comment isn't showing up (after 29 minutes). Maybe it just needs to be manually approved for some reason. But, honestly, it makes me feel like I'm wasting my time by trying to participate here. Which is a shame because the main other sub is actively anti-bitcoin. Maybe it's time to walk away from it all.

Enforcing pseudonyms for BIPs is a good idea. Ideas should matter, not personalities. This strange notion that in order to judge an idea you need to know who came up with it is...strange.

FYI: is a buttcoin troll who has been spamming r/bitcoin recently. Look at "his" history.

I've read enough of your comments to totally believe that story is true.
You take a fair amount of abuse here, but I usually agree with you and think you're alright. Working for bitcoins is a much better route to obtaining bitcoins than using exchanges. Trusting exchanges is idiotic, and I'm glad you point that out. As far as "enforcers of the rules" (like in this post) go, I've never found "just doing my job" to be a very good excuse. Most people choose their jobs. If someone chooses to be a tool of authoritarians, I'm inclined to think of them as a tool.
Your critics sometimes have a fair point too though. It might be worth considering ratcheting things down a notch once in a while. :)

Maybe some upstanding profs, like Stolfi or Goon?

Nice catch. But the "best" route should be the cheapest which may not be the shortest. Is it clear that A-&gt;B-&gt;D is necessarily cheaper than A-&gt;C-&gt;B-&gt;D? If the B-&gt;C channel has a low balance for B, then B will offer low fees (or no fees or even negative fees) for using C-&gt;B. This might mean the sum of the fees for A-&gt;C and C-&gt;B is lower than the single fee for A-&gt;B. Or have I missed something?

My guess is that it's Prof. Goon or one of his lackeys/grad students. Prof. Goon seems to be the main troll attacking Back at the moment.
