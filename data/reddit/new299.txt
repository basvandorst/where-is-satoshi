Why do you think it's taken me 6 years? You assume I've been in business for 6 years? The shop has been online for less than a year, most of the time I've not really been focusing on it and I've recently just started adding more products and released it was a good time to add bitcoin support too.

I have a bunch of self assemble kits here:

It's an 8 channel acquisition system so if you wanted to monitor 8 different analogue voltages with a reasonably good ADC you could use this. The inputs could be, temperature sensors, pressure sensors anything really. I designed it for use with a microscope I was building and needed a bunch of good quality analogue inputs.

So, for the most part the shop contains my own designs which aren't available elsewhere. There are other items, which I get from taobao, there's no way to beat the eBay sellers on price. The other items are either not generally available on eBay (so I get them direct from China) or they're just small things which I've tested and documented and people occasionally purchase at a small markup.

I'm currently shipping from Japan. I'm a UK citizen though, and come to the UK reasonably often. It takes about a week from Japan generally.

The link is from Travis Goodspeed who is a pretty well known security researcher. That's basically it, he's not provided any other information.

I meant that I exchanging wealth without an exchange of goods or services, doesn't seem great to me.

Does anyone have any experience with these guys, successful transaction?

I was thinking this myself the other day, however people have pointed out that this is an issue for basically anything that lets you send transactions. You'll always be able to encode information in a series of transactions. Say if someone sends you a series of bank transactions that could be decoded as child porn. Does that make you, or the bank, liable? Or does it require intent, and the ability to decode that information too?
If tinyurl stores a series a URLs that could be decoded as child porn, are they liable?
I don't think the issue is clear cut. I think it's also basically impossible to censor the blockchain.

sure, I those are just my scribblings really. I think Gox are probably handling the DDOS as well as can be expected. But I think it might be nice to have other routes to trade through than the web interface. I wonder if perhaps you could trade directly through the bitcoin network?
