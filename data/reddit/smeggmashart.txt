Yeah, just send it to your wallet address. Dont keep stuff on an exchange unless you plan on trading it. Dont forget to keep track of your trades for tax purposes (amount, price, time).

We were thriving for 150 years before taxes. It wasn't until 1913 when the US introduced income tax. Lots of countries have no income tax and can thrive. There are 1000's of ways to fund a government. Income Taxation is the cruelest.

Kraken or coinbase are ones I use. Poloniex, Livecoin, and Kucoin are others but not as easy for new comers.

Makes me wanna drive the 2 hours and go to Clackamas to witnees this ATM.

Coinbase has fees like crazy idk what you're talking about. Kraken is my go to

Yeah you're approaching it good. I've had some slight issues with Authenticator and all i can say is back it up in case your phone shits, and maybe deregister coinbase and re-register it. Otherwise I understand the frustrations.  
Just a trouble shoot I would do.

I wish there was a way I didn't have to use coinbase. Kraken is my friend for trading but can't do wire transfers at all. Too poor for it.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:53:13
Because you're transferring fiat from a fiat bank to an exchange? Not crypto to crypto.

I keep my coins in a wallet so I control what happens to them. 
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:36:26
I'm gonna be that person and ask, "did you try restarting your phone?"
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:33:18
So are you trying to log into coinbase now? What wallet will you decide to use to store your BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:12:52
I'm a fan of Kraken, and use the coinbase wallet as well.

Great explanation to a newcomer...
Monero uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. You get crypto from an address that is ever changing so you never know the origins.

Buy now you won't be able to move the funds for like a week so sooner is better
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:13:06
It won't be instant. You will recieve the funds instantly, but you will not be able to buy/sell, or transfer until funds are approved. They will pull from your account first then take like 3 days before they release full access to you. I wired my bank account to coinbase and it still isn't instant.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:56:20
Coinbase - but do coinbase pro to avoid fees. I use Kraken for feeless trading, but use coinbase to purchase crypto.

I'm a Doge holder but I'm curious why everyone recommends Doge. You just shilling a meme coin? What's you're reason for recommending Doge?
