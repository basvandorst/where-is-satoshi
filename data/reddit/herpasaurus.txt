I timed it nicely this time. Been through a few ups and downs now. Overall made a lot of money. Feels good.

No thanks, he's still republican scum.

Could you give some examples? I'm also not too keen on LocalBitcoin, though its the best option I have, I think.

I'm gonna go ahead and jinx this run and say that it's gonna take a dive in the next few days. My completely unprofessional and stupid gut feeling, but there you have it.

When you were midway through your life's journey, and found upon your path a dark passage, above
which these words were written- abandon all hope, ye who tradeth here.
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:25:56
Virgilius? 
"Abandon all hope, Ye who enterth this market" would have been better, just as a n.b.

Good point, I didn't dig too deep into it. Haven't been looking much at charts since the Bloodbath That Shall Not Be Named.
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:31:35
Bro, do you even stack?
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:50:24
Hey, if you don't mind, but with shorted you mean that they auto sold as soon as it hit 4K? I'm probably wrong about that, but if I weren't, wouldn't that have tanked the price? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:45:52
Aah, thanks yall!

I'm a noob, are bear traps traps FOR bears or traps SET by bears?

He experiences the same amount of tragedies as everyone else though, with all the additional risks that come with mountaineering in a tweed suit.

I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. It gained 20% in one day flat, there has got to be some kind of speculation going on by big players, or some good news broke for very many small ones.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:43:41
Can someone tell me what happened on [the 2nd of April]( I'm very much out of the loop but suddenly found myself with a bunch of extra money.
Some good news dropped or what?
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:53:35
I timed this one perfectly for once. I make sure to spend some as I go, both to cash in a little and to support the economy.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:47:42
Then another fucking business is not what we need.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:05:00
Is it, though?
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:00:28
Thanks for writing out an actual reply.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:46:52
Pay for massive global ad campaigns, billboards, full page newspaper ads, Super Bowl commercials, literally saying "Go fuck yourself". It would run for months or years on end. Just "go fuck yourself", black on white, or white on black, whatever is cheaper.

What could possibly be driving this run? I've been burned before, feels like another artificial pump before some major player exits the market.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:07:44
Can you be more wrong than just wrong, though?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:21:06
I DO want the organic patchouli oil, if you don't mind me saying. I want to sprinkle it all over her free range titties!
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:07:12
That is not even a complete sentence.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:06:38
Well \*I* have a problem with it! A BIG fucking problem!
