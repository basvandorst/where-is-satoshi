2late4bitcoin , dogecoin already got that crowd, game over bro. 
Actually j/k doe, dogecoin is for the nerds and outcasts, bitcoin is for the rebels (who are now being rebelled against by dogecoin, so meta) and for everyone else, theres mastercard.

Satoshi may have created something cool, but unfortunately you can't code away the stupidity of humans. Bitcoin is/has/will continue to take some huge blows due to idiocy.

I'm just gonna hijack this post to say its a problem with both of them.
The bitcoin protocol isn't broken it just does stuff in a way that is not smart and the devs know it they just got complacent and lazy watching the price rise while they just sat back jerkin their gerkins .. I mean for fucks sake
But mt gox was dumb too they have no programming skill at all and are trying to take care of peoples electronic moneys which is stupid.. some exchanges didnt have to shut down at all cause they actually RTFM

Dud you are a fucking idiot they are taking their time because the market is so shit on Gox that if they implemented the fix in one go that 
1) everyone would just pull out all their coins
2) hackers would steal all the coins on the new system that hasnt been tested
 .. god yall are so dumb and have no business trading or worrying about shit like this. Just put your coins in cold storage and gtfo for about 5 years.

Even if people like bitcoin, why would they buy it ?
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:05:38
They are smart for not giving him money to buy BTC - even if BTC is a great investment in 5 years time he would already have panic sold
