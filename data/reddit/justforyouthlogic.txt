No. It's 2018 and we aren't but a few clicks away from just about anything you're willing to learn. If you can create an account on Reddit and post comments, then you should be able to use very basic logic.

So, now we're discussing how people should spend their money? Just shut up man, I told you to shut your mouth. If you spend a single dime on recreation or fashion then you're a hypocrite.

Dude, we know what we are doing. Just fuck off and let the adults with spare money have our fun. Who the fuck stands next to a slot machine reminding everyone of their likely demise? Never mind the fact that Bitcoin is a much better bet than a vegas slot machine. We've been here before. The sun rises, the sun sets. Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down. People like you show up and then you disappear. It's the circle of life, faggot.

Why are you even here?

Not sure what point you're making here. My response to his comment stands.

eh I hate having to disclose a bunch of information to some business. Just want to meet up with someone and give them cash. The anonymity and privacy factor just feels good for some reason. Like a breath of fresh air. Thanks for the response though!

Random question, but what would be the cheapest way for me to buy some Bitcoin? I really don't want to spend 500 plus dollars on fees. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:25:18
Feds?? Is BTC illegal or something? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:49:04
Don't pay attention this this person or waste your time with that garbage video. Move along. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:50:12
How is it non anon? I can make a random Bitcoin address and go buy BTC in cash. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:24:57
Well, yeah. Of course.

It's odd that you choose to say "everyone" because that certainly wasn't the case for me. When I was doing my research, I came across many cautionary tales and was able to come to the very reasonable conclusion that this is NOT a guarantee and that ALL of the money I invested would be at risk. A lot of people will always have to learn the hard way, and some aren't even that fortunate.

God damn.

You shut your mouth. The price has gone up and down for years. It shouldn't even matter either way because what sort of irresponsible person would gamble with money they can't afford to lose.

The volatility of crypto is widely documented.
