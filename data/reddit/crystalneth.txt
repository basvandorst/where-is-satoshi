When Mt Gox declared this was an issue, the developers and community shouted about how it was a known bug with a simple workaround, and Mt Gox was being obstinate and making excuses.
Not to defend Mt Gox entirely, but clearly that was the wrong reaction and this bug should not have festered so long.

This is not true. You might say transaction malleability can not be used to steal coins with a "properly" implemented system, where properly means that it contains a workaround to protect against this serious bug. However it most certainly can be used to steal coins in some cases.
The community consensus around the SR2 theft is probably about as reliable as the community consensus was that malleability was not a major concern, until suddenly it quite clearly was.

Given that you can't withdraw fiat currency either, I'm not sure what the Mt Gox price has to do with anything. Why bother selling?

Indeed, there may be pent up demand.
There may also be pent up demand to cash out, but everyone knows it takes too long for exchanges to move money, and some of them behave super dodgy (MtGox), so they keep their bitcoins.
If you were lucky enough to make $10M in bitcoin, you're going to have a tough time cashing out until the exchanges get their acts together, and you risk an exchange going bankrupt or losing your coins. In the end, you may just keep your coins and wait for better liquidity.

It's also important to get into why we would want to "build deep liquid markets for Bitcoin" in the US.
There are many good answers to this question, but the best answer for a Senator: because it's going to happen with or without us, and from both an economic and national security perspective, it makes sense to have the underpinnings of Bitcoin in the US, and in USD.
The US government needs to stop pressuring banks to close accounts for Bitcoin companies quickly, and provide a safe legal basis for Bitcoin companies to operate.
