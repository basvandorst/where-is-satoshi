S2X wasn't saved by full nodes, it was cancelled and never went live. 
Nodes do not propagate anything. They do no work, they do not have authority to add anything to the blockchain. In fact, if you look at my reply below (or do your own research) you'd know that a full non-mining node is actually IN THE WAY when someone sends a tx because only a mining node can propagate a transaction.
S2X was not some backroom plan, S2x was the original agreement between software developers and nearly every single miner. Miners implemented the Segwit UASF based on the promise that 2X would be soon to follow. Everything was planned out and agreed then when Segwit was implemented, the miners had the rug pulled out and the narrative was changed.
At the end of the day, miners ARE the network. They do the work to process transactions and their reward is the block value and tx fees. The entire system is designed with the assumption that miners would be greedy and they would work to protect the network out of self-interest. Any attack on the network requires majority hash power, not majority nodes, and anyone that had control of majority hash power has more to gain by maintaining the status quo. 
So the fact that the miners want bigger blocks which would severely reduce the rewards they get from fees and also pose a potential risk with a hard fork should be very telling to you. If the miners were so evil, they'd want small blocks to push fees as high as possible but that doesn't seem to be the case, does it?

No individual payment system that exists today, including major credit card companies OR any crypto solutions could handle every single financial transaction in the world. LN wouldn't be able to handle it even if it worked as promised. 
But I almost forgot where I am. The frequent posts of "A dude said a thing I agree with, suck it bcash!" just get tiring especially because BCH supporters have no fundamental problems with second layer solutions as long as they work, are secure and decentralized. BCH supporters do, however, reject the idea of postponing simple, effective solutions based on promises of some other incomplete and untested solution to be released at some undetermined future date.
BCH dev teams are working on their own second layer solutions right now because in the future there will likely be a need for it. In the meantime, until that technology is developed and functional, on-chain scaling will not be prevented.

You mean that when more lanes were available, more people decided it was economical to use the roads? *No fucking shit.* Using your argument, BTC is still in 1950 where the average highway was 2 lanes except now the amount of traffic is 10x higher.
Nobody who uses BCH complains about fees or processing times while the number of transactions BCH processes has caught up to the number that BTC does so the "nobody uses BCH" argument is now dead.


Bitcoin Cash's job isn't to impress you, it's to remain functional and consistent. If consistency and predictability bore you then that's your problem. Until new solutions are developed, block size increases will be performed as needed. In fact, it's entirely possible that the block size limit will be removed completely and block sizes will be determined by the bandwidth and capacity of miners because they can mine whatever size blocks their infrastructure can handle as long as its lower than the limit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:02:29
Like many communities, BCH is supported by a diverse group of people all with their own opinions and motives. BTC is no different. 
You're probably right that many BCH supporters don't like the idea of off-chain scaling solutions but the goal of BCH developers is to make those solutions optional rather than mandatory. As long as the block size can be scaled in order to keep on-chain fees low and processing times standard then the only benefit that off-chain solutions would need to provide is speed.
If second-layer solutions are useful, they'll be used, and eventually the BCH ecosystem may equalize where the block size will no longer need to be increased if a large portion of transactions move off chain. However, they should never be implemented in a way that a need is unnecessarily and artificially created especially when the timeline for the solution's implementation is uncertain.

This is a post showing recent BCH blocks... A block consists of confirmed transactions.
If they're spamming zero fee transactions, I care even less because miners can ignore those tx anyway. If the mempool is full of zero fee transactions and blocks aren't full, they aren't negatively affecting the network because normal transactions can still be processed. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:03:46
If you knew anything about Bitcoin's core ideals, you'd know that the miners are *supposed* to be as greedy as possible. The entire system is built with the assumption that greed always wins. Blockstream/Core are undermining that philosophy by trying to change the narrative. 
Miner's greed is what keeps the network alive. If LN is "great success!" and moves all TX off chain, miners won't have any reason to mine once block rewards are too low because LN Hubs(read: banks) will be taking all the fees for themselves.

Bitcoin futures have no effect on the markets because they are not active market trades. The Bitcoin that these companies are using is in their account(assuming they have any at all) and the contracts are settled in USD.
You can look at the history of GBTC, a bitcoin "ETF" that for a while was trading at a 50% premium to Bitcoin. Futures are even further removed and have no effect on the market.
However, it is possible that the people running the futures have enough capital with which to manipulate the unregulated BTC markets and create whatever scenario they bet on in their futures contracts.
I expect that BTC will see large swings every time the contract expiration dates come up. BTC may have a large market cap but because of arbitrage traders and the fact that there are so many markets, someone with a relatively small amount of money can pump the price of any crypto they want.

What you're quoting here is about miners. Back when Bitcoin was developed, and in the whitepaper all discussion about "full nodes" was actually "mining node" because *there is no reason for a full node that doesn't mine because it has no monetary stake in the network*. The narrative has been changed now and it appears you've been caught in the crossfire. You're welcome to do your own research on it but any time Satoshi uses the phrase "full node" he's actually referencing miners.


And a single development team didn't agree to something that 90% of the community did and therefore what S2X supporters did was nefarious? Do you not realize that Core is actually only something like 4 or 5 people? You've mentioned being afraid of centralization, but you already have it. NYA included hundreds of people that spanned miners, users and developers. Core is ONE group, that is only developers, who are under the payroll of Blockstream. Follow the money, don't be dense.
So I'm going to stop there. You're throwing stones in a glass house, you don't know the actual history of Bitcoin and the rest of what you've written seems like high-effort trolling. I've enjoyed the debate but that enjoyment has come to an end so I'll leave it here. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:46:57
Personally, I don't believe the idea that block size increases will automatically result in centralization because it just doesn't make any sense. 
Full, non-mining nodes do very little to secure the network. They perform no work, they don't confirm transactions or process anything. They simply follow the Blockchain that's being written by real full nodes(miners) that are running the same software. If 100% of the miners decided to hard fork, then the nodes may "reject" the blocks but the chain the nodes are on would end because it had no miners on it. Meanwhile, the nodes would continue to reject blocks from the forked network which would continue on as-is while completely ignoring the node rejections. Non-mining nodes were never supposed to even exist because they don't actually secure the network or provide "consensus" because they technically don't get a vote.
The notion that the block size must be kept small in order to prevent centralization so that full nodes can afford to run is just a red herring and has no validity in the argument. I would be more concerned about centralization if all the decision making for a cryptocurrency were controlled by a handful of gatekeepers that have final say in any coin's direction.

If an equal number of people used BCH as BTC and fees on BTC were higher, what would be the problem then?
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:27:49
My point is that nodes don't somehow "secure the network" because, as I said before, if every miner decided they want to upgrade Bitcoin somehow and fork the chain, they will leave the nodes behind and it wouldn't matter. This is because the nodes aren't competing via hash power, they're just recording the results.
In your example, the miners aren't running a competing version of software so there's no reason for a full node that doesn't mine. Bitcoin is a distributed system based *entirely* on hashing power. Non-mining nodes don't protect against any attacks on the network because, in order to attack or protect it, you need majority hashing power.
This is of course not even getting in to the fact that full nodes actually get in the way when someone makes a transaction because a non mining node can't add anything to the blockchain either. So if you send a tx and it hits a non mining node first, your transaction is delayed until it gets to a miner who can add it.

BCH users have no policy against second level scaling solutions--if they work. LN so far is proving to not be useful in any meaningful way but if it turns out otherwise there's no reason it couldn't be adopted. However, what BCH users *won't* do is prevent a simpler solutions from being implemented while it's developed in order to alleviate congestion or maintain functionality.

The actual TRUE information about Bitcoin is still a totally vaid problem though. I've been involved since 2012 and the landscape and IDEALS of Bitcoin are far in the rearview never to be seen again. 
I admit that a lot of misinformation and "FUD" is being thrown around but, in the end, Bitcoin has lost a lot of its utility which is precisely what it's supposed to be. If some government seizes control its country's currency Bitcoin is supposed to be there to soften the blow but it's not doing that, it's actually unuseable for the people that it was built for.
What's the answer when people cant even use it for it's designed purpose? Do you change the narrative and give it a new purpose? Change the technology? Give it a new name?

OR, you know, ALTERNATIVELY;
Not many people actually had BCH available for sale on that one exchange when it opened so, like *every other exchange ever* when a new currency is released, the price is ridiculously inflated before it settles out.
This isn't new, or unique, or an attack, it was super standard behavior when a new commodity gets listed on an exchange at a particular starting price.
BCH didn't go near $5k on any other exchange and arbitrage traders drove up the prices on the smaller ones without even breaking $4k. This isn't an attack or manipulation at all, it's pure greed on a single exchange and now there are bagholders who bought BCH at $5k+. 
Revel in the notion that someone paid a 50% premium on BCH because of their own stupid greed. Also be aware that these markets are much bigger and more diverse than you think. The amount of money that would be required to actually manipulate them would be far more than you're capable of understanding.

Non-mining nodes don't benefit the network in any way and some would argue that they actually do damage. They slow down transactions from being added to the block because only miners can add transactions. They perform no work and cannot prevent a 51% attack because they aren't casting a vote. They can't prevent a hard fork because that's not how hard forks work. They can't prevent a soft fork because that's not how soft forks work.

That's the *other* issue though. The only people that will have the capital with which to run large LN nodes are individuals with huge balances and exchanges/banks. They will expect a sizeable return from their effort to support the network because they'll be competing with insanely high tX fees and credit cards. There's a ton of money being left on the table otherwise. 
The only sure thing here is human greed. In the long run, nobody is going to run a LN hub for cheap or free because they don't have to. They'd just be denying themselves potential income.
When this hub-and-spoke system is in place(the only way in which LN is viable), the centralization will be real because any one of those hubs could decide on a whim to close all channels that are attached to it and force users to pay network fees in order to recover any BTC remaining in their channel.

If a single person opens 14 channels, that's 14 on-chain transactions, not 7. In this simulation, each "user" initiates the opening of 14 channels meaning that the average user would have 28 channels open, 14 that it initiated and 14 that were initiated toward it making a total of 140 million channels between 10 million users.




Low-value nodes will not be useful on this network at all. The average user won't have any incentive whatsoever to run a node because the security risks would outweigh any potential benefits. 
I understand that, at this stage, it's an opinion-based argument so we'll have to see but if LN actually succeeds it will not be with a "mesh" type system, it will be with a hub-and-spoke. Those hubs will need an immense amount of BTC available and security surrounding it. They will not offer their service for free and "cheap" will only be in context with the current on-chain network fees. If $30 is the average tX fee, LN hubs making their fees $10 would be comparatively "cheap" though still insane versus every other crypto. They have only to compete with the blockchain fees because there will be little reason for them to compete with each other especially if they're the only game in town. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:36:00
In all honesty, the miners are ignoring the low-fee transactions until the mempool clears so spamming the network with zero-fee transactions doesn't do anything other than make the mempool look bad. 
Eventually, those tx would just fall off the mempool as rejected and it would be returned to the original wallet. Until recently, the only transactions that would be rejected were zero-fee and of a certain age. Now we're seeing higher fee transactions getting rejected because the volumes are so high. A tx with a "normal" fee getting rejected is actually a horrible thing because it means that no matter how much spamming is being done, legitimate transactions are being rejected regardless of any real or perceived "attacks" that may or may not be taking place. 
Originally, and by originally I mean 2008 when Bitcoin was being developed, blocks had no size limit and the 1mb cap was added to prevent "spam attacks" which would theoretically be a situation where someone would maliciously create thousands of zero-fee transactions just to eat up memory space for full nodes(miners) or slow down the network. 
Now that the miners are probably some of the most wealthy individuals in the crypto sphere, memory is so cheap and anyone mining will have as high speed of internet as they can afford--more than plenty high enough to mine, the cap is no longer *needed* other than for the religious fanatics who cling to the old idea that spam attacks are still a problem even though it's based on 10 year old technology.
In short, these "attacks" are likely really just people looking for a reason as to why Bitcoin is having difficulty with its value lately. I don't begrudge them that reaction but, in reality, and because the block size is still 1mb, "spam attacks" aren't really a thing and even if they were, they have little to no effect on the network other than the mempool charts.

You're speaking with fallacies.
It actually seems like you believe an 8mb block size *limit* means that every block takes 8mb of storage space which is not true. 
In reality, storage is only taken up by the transactions that were processed. If it's 1 or 2mb of Tx in an 8mb block, it only takes up 1 or 2mn of storage space.
There is nothing inefficient about having a much larger limit than the typical block size because BCH can handle huge spikes in activity and barely notice. Trying to compare larger blocks to an empty truck driving around wasting fuel is extremely misleading. Anyone arguing that this analogy is in any way relevant is just showing how little they know about blockchains.
Meawhile, Bitcoin's backlog seems to be never ending and people like you come on here trying to convince people that this is somehow good for Bitcoin or working as intended.

The *entire point of Bitcoin* is to have low/no fees for doing transactions in order to make it accessible to as many people as possible.

Every single player in the cryptosphere has incentive to "spam" attack the network:
Blockstream/Core in order to congest the network and incentivize as much adoption of LN as possible. 
Competitors in order to destabilize Bitcoin and drive people to alts. 
Investors to make transactions slow and expensive to punish/disincentivize panic selling.
With all of those things working in tandem, they would eventually begin to cancel each other out. A true, free market checks and balances system. 
The only people suffering are the users.

14 channels per person connected randomly meaning that it would have required 140 million on-chain transactions to even set this network up and another 140 million to close it. 
An average of 300,000 tX per day means it would take 466 days for this theoretical network to even exist and another 466 days to shut it down. 
All-in, there would be nearly $10 billion USD spent in on-chain transactions using today's average BTC transaction fee of ~$35. 
This also assumes that people playing banker by leaving their LN channels open would be happy with a 0.001% return while their BTC inaccessible which is absurdly low. I would be surprised if LN transactions aren't more like 0.1 to 1%. 
Also, will users have any control over what fees they pay or will they just be at the whim of whatever nodes are available? If someone opens a node with 20BTC and puts a 5% fee on it, how will users avoid it if it's the only game in town with a balance big enough to move their tX?

You're wrong. Futures markets don't have to be balanced. When they're balanced, the price doesn't move. But if there are more short contracts than long, the price will trend downward until it equalizes again. 
If I want to short BTC I sell BTC right *now* and promise to buy it back later. All I need in order to carry out a short is a buyer *today*. You might consider that the buyer *today* is taking a long position but there's nothing that says it has to mirror match the short in the length of his position. 
If a whole pile of people want to short a commodity and nobody is taking long positions, it will drive the price down due to short seller activity. Inversely, if there's not enough people shorting, the price will trend up until they're convinced to sell. 
The main problem with futures on Bitcoin is that there is *no underlying value* and nothing that investors can use to say "I think it will go up for reason X". The only reason people are buying BTC now is with the expectation that other people will buy after them.

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:59:25
That is exactly correct. 
The original 1mb hard fork was implemented because people in the development team believed that an unlimited block size would make the Blockchain vulnerable to "spam attacks" meaning that tons of zero-fee transactions could be sent in order to inflate the memory requirements and prevent people from being able to mine the currency.
Keep in mind that this is when people literally mined Bitcoin with their desktop PC and the standard hard drive was around 60GB. 
A lot has changed since then but a lot of people still cling to that idea even though nobody mines on their desktop PC any more and anyone who does mine has plenty of capital with which to buy a $200 hard drive that can handle storing the entire blockchain.

I've been around cryptos a long time, going on 5 years now. The only subject within the crypto world that the word "attack" exists is the "51%" attack vulnerability of Blockchains.

SW is opt-in and nobody uses it. LN is opt-in and even fewer people will use it because it has no utility in a real economy. This is not conspiracy or opinion, this is fact based on the current version of LN and its features. 
It will solve nothing. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months from now Bitcoin will still be gridlocked unless it stars losing enough support that people aren't even making transactions so block size won't matter any more. 
I predict that Core is eventually, as an emergency measure, going to increase the block size and go against the narrative they've been pushing for the last 6 months. That is, if they fail to do a good enough job to convince BTC users that Bitcoin needs a second layer banking system that they control, anyway.

I would honestly suggest you do your own research on this and make your own determination. Cryptos have become a lot like the stock market recently where you get a lot of biased information and even lies telling you what to do. BCH can currently handle at least 8X the transactions that BTC can. Lighting Network is still in development and nowhere in sight and can honestly probably not handle billions of TX/second even if conditions were perfect. 
I won't spend time going into the problems that LN has but, please, do your own research if you're looking to invest. reddit is not the place to get your investing information.

This is the part of the article I took my information from:


Which is slightly misleading because it suggests that each user opened and funded 14 channels with 0.1 BTC, not 7, because only one person in the transaction would be providing funds.
Later it states:


Even with only 70 million channels, at the current daily average number of processed transactions (~300,000) it will still take approx 233 days for all of these channels to be opened *assuming no other activity on the blockchain*. The point is that this level of activity on the LN with the current BTC block size is not realistic and that this experiment has very little value beyond a basic QA software test instead of a use-case scenario for an economic tool.
As for the major LN hubs likely needing thousands of BTC, I'm getting mixed information on this and there seems to be no clear answer. I have seen it described several times that anyone who acts as a hub in the LN will need to have at least as much BTC available in the balance as people are trying to transact. When a transaction is sent, the BTC in the hubs who participate in the transaction is effectively "locked" until the send/receive channels are closed and settled on the blockchain as a security measure. If you have conflicting information about this I'd be interested to see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:23:19
But that's the problem. If the network is so expensive that people are incentivized to open their own direct channels why wouldn't they just do a single on-chain tX instead of 2 plus a LN tX?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:28:53
The way I understand it, if you have 5 hops to make a LN transaction, every single person in between you and the recipient must have at least the amount of BTC *available* that you send. 
It looks more like -1, -1, -1, -1, +1* and the +1 is not available to spend until the channel closes. 
Once the channels are closed the balances settle and become available again because while the transaction is technically open, those funds cannot be used because there would be a vulnerability for double spends.
I also read that any person involved in these hops can close the channel forcing your channel to close too. If that's true, it sounds absolutely terrible to give someone else any kind of control over whether or not my channel closes and "settles" forcing me to pay another on-chain fee. This is of course not mentioning the fact that I would have already paid an on-chain fee to open the channel.

Bread wallet, or any wallet that allows you to control your personal key doesn't rely on servers for anything other than updates. If Bread wallet ceased to exist, their current version would still be compatible with the current blockchain version.


The balance is pulled from the blockchain, nothing to do with Bread servers.


Bread servers don't broadcast transactions, the wallet does,


Not an issue ever because bread transacts directly with the blockchain.
Is this really the quality of advice given out on r/bitcoin now? This is a fucking disgrace.

It's called competition. 
If you're an engine developer your job is to make the most powerful and efficient engine for the cheapest price that you can. Being first to market is only a valuable trait for a limited amount of time.
If you've been humming along for 5 years with no competition, life is great, life is easy because you're still relevant. 
But, "Oh shit!", something came out that's faster *and* cheaper!! 
The longer it takes for you to adapt to that competition the more market share you lose. This is not a new concept, this is reality in literally every market that's ever existed.
Bitcoin's slow reaction time will be its death. It's not even innovating at this point because other coins have come out with payment channels *built in*. LN is too little, too late. Bitcoin's failure to scale via *any method whatsoever* is why it won't succeed to the levels that the cult expects. Believing in something does not make it so. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:25:29
My questions were about your claim that bigger blocks create centralization and my assertions were that LN is a move TOWARD centralization. Both points you ignored.
Bigger blocks are not necessarily and end-game answer to scaling but they sure as shit are the simplest and fastest way to alleviate congestion in order to maintain functionality. There is no such thing as "rushing" a block size increase because, as you say, the subject has been discussed ad nauseum for the full 5 years that I've been involved in Bitcoin.
The same reason that I don't subscribe to unprovable conspiracy theories is why I don't trust LN to fulfill all its promises. I base my opinions on facts and evidence. There is no evidence to support the idea that LN will solve scalability problems. None. If Lightning Network is the only thing that can "save" Bitcoin right now, mark my words. It's doomed.

I'm not saying that Bitcoin was launched a finished product, I think that's something everyone can agree on. The problem is that utility has been absolutely *crippled* and Bitcoin has lost all momentum which has caused a huge portion of the cryptoscape to shift their attention to arguably better alternatives, all for solutions that seem to have no release date or legitimate viability. 
If in 1940 I asked you to cut your legs off with the promise that we'd come up with bionic technology to replace them without that technology already existing, would you do it?

Since it seems nobody has answered, hopefully not because they don't actually know, if you have a private wallet, YES you have to sync the whole blockchain(bring it up to date) in order to confirm your balance(for sure). However, unless you copied the wallet, synced it somewhere else and moved/sold the coins then it won't have that balance when you're done. 
I hope you have your coins because it would be an amazing windfall though I'm skeptical that someone with 5k Bitcoin would somehow "forget" that they have them.

This is especially true for Bitcoin which has no underlying value whatsoever and currently not even any utility. 
Blockchain tech is not some revolutionary software. It has a very specific purpose but that purpose seems to have been forgotten on this sub. If you're investing in cryptos because you believe in the technology I highly recommend that you actually learn about it first.

BTC becoming similar to a bank is precisely the opposite reason that it was developed in the first place. I've seen people on here try calling BCH the "banker's coin" but, here we are, discussing a bank account system with centralized hubs who act as money exchangers for BTC. 
I also believe that you vastly overestimate the population of r/bitcoin versus the entire Bitcoin blockchain. Single exchanges can perform hundreds of thousands of on-chain transactions in a single day while r/bitcoin just recently crossed 600k readers. The average number of transactions processed in a single day is around 300,000.

I own several cryptos including BTC and everything I own has performed better than BTC over the last week despite its current price.
I'm not interested because you're posting opinion pieces, not data.
If you were able to convince me that LN were somehow useful to.. well.. anyone, perhaps I would agree with you. But everything I read about LN is self-contradictory nonsense based on theories that aren't reality and written by people who stand to gain from its implementation. I assure you that LN, the same as Segwit will have no impact on the price of BTC. 
If you want to see what's driving the market check out an ETF called Bitcoin Investment Trust and do some reading about Bitfinex issuing $320 million in fraudulent USDT. I'm talking about over a billion fraudulent USD(that I know of) entering the BTC market. Or don't and keep believing that segwit is a magical market price booster, up to you.

Bitcoin has become nothing but a speculator's market, the only thing people think about these days is valuation. It's pretty disappointing all the memes and shitposting going on that talk about "HODL" and prices lately. Why the does price matter if you're never going to sell or spend it?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:10:07
You're thinking too narrow. Tether is operated by Bitfinex who is an exchange and one of the primary problems with exchanges is the huge amount of red tape required for exchanges to offer fiat-to-crypto trading especially across borders. 
They sell Tether under a certain umbrella with very tight controls such as their identity verification requirements and once a customer owns Tether their fiat money becomes a cryptocurrency that they can enter into the wild, unregulated west that everyone loves.
It means that exchanges get another huge volume market that they can extract trading fees from and increases the amount of cryptos that change hands every day. 
The people who developed Tether did it to support their real business which is their exchange. Offering it as a low cost/free service means wider adoption and more money changing hands. It's really quite a clever business plan.

I know that LN doesn't *require* hubs but it's even more useless without them. 
Can you tell me in what case I'd want to open a LN channel with someone directly? If I want to sell someone Bitcoin or use it to buy something I have to do a transaction on the Blockchain **first** in order to open a LN channel which I have to wait for confirmation. Then I'd do the LN transaction and then to "settle" the transaction I have to do another Blockchain transaction and wait for that to confirm. I have then paid fees 3 times to do one transaction.
So now we've established that LN is useless without the existence of Hubs run by individuals/corporations who must have extremely deep pockets in order to open one. Hubs are going to be a financial service that exchanges currency. Those types of services are heavily regulated and have the same problems that exchanges have now so eventually, they will require you to "register" with them and likely confirm your identity in order to make large transactions. 
You still haven't explained to me what problem LN solves.

Hard forks are the primary function of scalability and evolution of cryptocurrencies. One could argue that things like Segwit are half-measures and Lightning Networks are hostile takeovers designed to subvert Bitcoin by creating a centralized top layer that's controlled by centralized organizations.
Cryptocurrencies are a free market and a group of users forking a chain and continuing on in the way they deem best is not an attack, it's competition. If you open a grocery store across the street from another store, would that be seen as an attack?
It has been known since the whitepaper that a blockchain fork is how Bitcoin will evolve and everyone that's been involved in cryptocurrencies will know that scalability and forks have been a subject of discussion for years. The people who fight so vehemently against the forks and refuse to allow bitcoin to evolve are the ones who are doing damage to it. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:58:57
Absolutely it is but you haven't answered my question.
The miners signalled SegWit as a compromise to larger blocks. They were ok with the competition but they wanted it to be a level playing field. As soon as SegWit activated, the developers pulled the rug out and started fighting bigger blocks. I would have been fine with SegWit if 2X happened at the same time but now I see it for what it really is; A hostile takeover.
And you still haven't answered my question. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:25:05
Why exactly do to the blocks have to be full for bitcoin to be secure? They weren't full for the first 5 years of its life and it's no more secure today than it was then. It's no more secure than BCH or any other coin who doesn't have full blocks. If anything it makes it LESS secure because the mempool has a 300mb cap. If that cap is ever hit, legitimate transactions will get rejected by the network. Would that be good for Bitcoin?
Lightning Network supporters seems to be able to perform some really interesting mental acrobatics and it all rests on the assumption that LN will somehow automatically increase the number of people who adopt bitcoin. 
There are too many assumptions being made coupled with lies(such as saying full blocks make BTC more secure) being thrown around to justify LN. Lightning Network means making fundamental changes to the BTC blockchain(security risk) and denying miners, the people who actually **are** the BTC network, the fees that they earn(another security risk).
If you have any facts that you can provide to overcome these concerns then I'm all ears. But no more speculation please.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:29:25
So what problem would LN be solving exactly? If miner fees are going up that means that users would be paying more. The money has to come from somewhere.
LN is supposed to make fees lower at the same time as increasing miner rewards? Those are two opposing scenarios.

And we very well *may* need them in the future, but they aren't ready. And in the meanwhile, blocks are full and users are suffering with expensive transaction fees and unreasonable confirmation times.
I am all for innovation but it seems that Core's strategy is to **create a need for their product** by denying a block size increase now. If the blocks were bigger and BTC went back to low fees and normal confirmation times, suddenly LN looks a lot less appealing(than it already does). 
So in your opinion what's the biggest risk right now? Because to me, keeping the blocks full, slow and expensive while dragging out political drama is doing a lot more damage to Bitcoin than a simple block size increase ever could. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:05:17
See, now you're talking with some sense. 
"I prefere 2X" is an opinion.

There are very different things.
Have you sold your 2X futures? For 1X already? If you haven't, then you're in the same exact economic position as the person you're saying has no economic opinion. If you have sold them, then I would say, objectively speaking,  that you made a pretty poor financial decision.

You just keep linking slanted articles from biased sources that contain "data" which is based entirely on assumptions. 
The assumption you've linked is that there wouldn't be enough incentive for miners to continue mining unless there was a backlog of transactions? Do you know how stupid that sounds?
That SAME argument can be used against Lightning Network because the whole point of LN is to take transactions off the blockchain. So if LN succeeds and the blocks aren't full, once the BTC supply limit is reached you're in the exact same position as if LN never happened and the block size was simply just increased.
The difference is that with LN you have a second layer of fees and a one-time transaction will take TWO blockchain events instead of just one. 
If I'm a victim of misinformation, I don't even want to speculate what you're a victim of. Got any more of those mental acrobatics for me?

The amount of computing power needed to confirm transactions within a 10 minute interval could be done by a freaking Pentium II from 1998.

@_date: 2017-10-08 18:52:05
So Bitcoin isn't anonymous because exchanges know who some people are? What about LN hubs? How do you know they won't fall into the same requirements as exchanges? LN hubs will be performing a similar service to exchanges and will likely fall under the same regulation that exchanges are facing now.
The public ledger is one of the things that gives Bitcoin its strength. If a user wants to obscure a transaction there are ways to do it but the ledger always balances out in order to prove that every Bitcoin in existence is legitimate. 
You still haven't explained why Bitcoin itself has privacy issues and instead made it about exchanges. Please keep the topic about Bitcoin. Also, even with LN active you *still have to buy bitcoin via an exchange* and LN transactions still have to interact with the blockchain. So what problem does LN solve privacy-wise, exactly?

I read them. As I said, they're biased opinion pieces that make assumptions about future events and work to push a narrative based on those assumptions. 
The very fact that you think blocks "have to be full" tells me that you've bought this propaganda hook line and sinker and never thought to ask yourself who benefits the most with this system. 
Full blocks, higher and more frequent fees? This isn't for the benefit of usability, this is for the benefit of the developers and owners of the LN "hubs" who are working to circumvent the miners and take the fees for themselves. 
You're defending LN so fervently that I could almost accuse you of having a personal stake in the technology. 
The audacity that you could claim "security" in the same breath as supporting changes to fundamental aspects of the blockchain is astounding.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:29:48
Being that it's a free market, it's completely within your right to support Core and LN. I would ask, though, if you know that block size increases and thus hard forks are "the way it's going to happen" why fight against it and widen the rift between the two camps?
That's one of the things I struggle with in this argument. Segwit, LN, and whatever other half-measure gets conceived only delays the inevitable. In the meantime more and more forks will be deployed by users who understand that a block size increase is necessary in order for Bitcoin to support new user adoption.
These complicated changes don't make the user experience better. They complicate the cryptocurrency environment and prevent new people from feeling confident and like they understand what they're putting their money and time into. You can see evidence of it all over this subreddit.

In actuality, this guy is doing exactly the right thing. He has an opinion whether you like it or not and he's positioning himself to come out the other side in a safe position regardless of what happens.
For him, and a lot of 2X believers, they care more about preserving their investment rather than some idiotic flame war/propaganda campaign.

Yes because Satoshi, when he developed Bitcoin just forgot to add Segwit to the code. Thank god for Core who had the foresight to save Bitcoin from larger block sizes.

@_date: 2017-10-23 07:31:42
My real beef is with LN and the prevention of a block size increase is the only thing that makes it remotely viable. Follow the money, who serves to gain the most from transactions taking place outside the blockchain? Would the group of people who want people to use their product "do the right thing" if it went against their business plan? You can ask yourself that same question about any company. 
Core and Blockstream are trying to prevent a blocksize increase in order to generate a need for a software platform they haven't developed. You think that's ok?

It is *the* explanation. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:16:01
So let me ask some questions:
1. Does the 2x code do anything more than increase the block size? (you actually didn't answer my questions during your politically charged tirade)
2. How long is long enough for people to discuss block size increases? Because I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011 and it's just as much a discussion now as it was then. Block size increases have been known about since before Segwit was even a concept.
3. Segwit is a prerequisite to "side-chain" scaling options. Do you know who has a patent on side chain technology? Blockstream.
4. If a block size increase, the solution that was known about as **the** solution from day 1 that Bitcoin was made public is "rushed" and makes Bitcoin at risk of being "under corporate control" why are you not saying the same thing about Segwit which was developed much more recently specifically for the purpose of allowing L2 transactions via a patented side chain technology?
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:10:36
I hate to be a downer but I've been involved in BTC since 2012 and this is the reason that it will never reach mass adoption. Using, holding, having, buying Bitcoin is fucking stressful, risky and dangerous and it takes a certain technological ability to even have the confidence to take it on. These stories drive even more fear than the volatility. 
Cryptos are absolutely the next wave of financial technology but Bitcoin will not be the platform. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:58:54
He didn't say what the "bug" was. He just said that Segwit somehow "fixed" it all while having an obviously biased view against miners. I know it may be difficult to provide a source of a neutral source on this subject but this guy is obviously wholly in one camp.
My issue with Segwit isn't what it does or even what it may or may not have fixed, it's that Segwit was part of the deal the miners agreed to when it came to the UASF which was supposed to be a demonstration of compromise/cooperation/consensus in the community. Core knows that bigger blocks are necessary at some point and the miners agreed to Segwit only because of promise of bigger blocks and now the rug is being torn out from under them seemingly for no reason at all. 
In my opinion, this is a total fuckup on the part of the developers. They're trying to change the rules in their favour and it's obvious that the motives driving them are just plain hatred of the miners. It's childish and underhanded and I can't support it. 
The worst part about this is, after this saga is over and if Bitcoin survives, the developers and miners will *never* compromise with each other ever again and these wars will continue to happen. It's shameful. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:14:01


This is false. There are no plans whatsoever to increase BCH to "Gb proportions soon".


Segwit and LN aren't "tampering with BTC"? You don't think that the Segwit changes tamper more than simply changing the block size from 1000 to 2000?


So which is it? Store of value or P2P transactions? And don't get me started on how LN is the worst possible solution for a P2P currency. Let me guess, you also think that LN will help BTC be more decentralized? If you do, I have a bridge to sell you. 


Oh, neat. I can cherry pick transactions too! 
[Here's]( a fee that has 14,836,520.632 sat/bytes


So again, which is it? Store of value or P2P currency?


It depends on the need. What if I were to stand outside a shopping mall punching people in the face and then offering to sell them an ice pack? Is that how you think needs should be created? Core and Blockstream are creating a need by fighting against a block size increase and, to this day, nobody has been able to explain to me why larger blocks would be a bad thing. 
I get people like you who say "development takes time, give them a chance!" which is not a reason to halt progress. And I also get people who spout patently false information by claiming that increasing blocks will somehow make storage more difficult or it will somehow make "small miners" unable to mine or whatever other bullshit reason they've been convinced of instead of doing their own research. 
All you've done here is spout lies and opinions based on false information and a full lack of understanding of what LN actually is and how it works. You really have no idea, it's quite sad.

I now am sure that you are in fact NOT a scientist and are instead just a paid shill trying to astroturf because a real scientist wouldn't ignore such an obvious answer.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:06:21
The precise reason that people oppose Segwit is because they refuse to be told what to do and instead formulate their opinions based on the merits of the product itself. Nobody has been able to prove why Segwit is objectively a better scaling solution than an increase to the block size. 
If Segwit were objectively "the" solution to the scaling problem, why is it *only* 17% right now? 83% of the transactions seem to disagree. Which one of those has more consensus?
That's one of the things I struggle with in this sub. Here, every single thread devolves into anti circlejerking. I'm not saying that doesn't occasionally do the same thing with regards to but it's just out of control over here.

SegWit is a threat to Bitcoin, not just me, or even you. 
I don't actually want 2X because it's already infected with SegWit and potentially LN which is a hostile takeover of Bitcoin as it was designed. 
LN is dead in the water and does not work, nor will it ever. Especially as a P2P system because it has too many flaws that cannot be reconciled in a manner that's more efficient than the blockchain itself. 
Hey, I wanna buy a coffee.. Oops I have to open a channel with Starbucks, ah shit that requires a Blockchain transaction with fees! Ok, 6 hours later, I have my funds in my LN account and I guess I still want coffee? Starbucks took my money and it was instant but I had to pay fees again. Next day: Oh shit, I want another coffee but overnight Starbucks closed my channel with them because they have bills to pay and needed to reconcile their accounts. I guess I have another 6 hours to wait and another fee to pay on the block chain. 
Rinse. Repeat. 
Boy that sounds like innovation that's gonna change the world!
Show me where in that scenario P2P is better than Bitcoin pre-SegWit. And if you start talking about payment hubs, then you really have drank the kool-aid because that means you support centralizing Bitcoin.

They will be soon with 2X. And nobody is rushing, block size increase requirements have been known about from day 1 of BTC even being public knowledge. It's a pivotal function of Bitcoin scaling.
This bullshit rhetoric that further delaying and "giving associated techs room to prove themselves" is a false argument because their success or failure should remain outside of the basic functionality of the blockchain. 
Core, and its associated cronies, and people like yourself who have been manipulated into going against your own best interest only want small blocks because it creates a need. A need that Segwit and, more importantly, the hostile takeover Lightning Network can "solve". With bigger blocks, Segwit and LN would be dead in the water. People would be asking "Why Segwit? Why LN?" if the blocks weren't full and transaction costs weren't going through the roof. 
I don't know how long you've been involved in Bitcoin but this is not a new conversation. I remember having this same conversation back in 2012 about bigger blocks except at that stage it was pure fear of what a hard fork might do to Bitcoin, now it's pure greed of companies literally trying to take it over.

So again, what does that have with computing power because now you're talking about storage.
Also, even if the block size was 500 terabytes it wouldn't matter because it's a cap, it's the maximum allowed amount of information on a block. If a 500 terabyte clock has ONE transaction on it that's 0.1 kilobytes, guess how much storage is going to be needed for the block? You guessed it; 0.1 kilobytes.
Now that your argument has been proven to be completely incorrect, how exactly would increasing the block size make it a "banker's coin"?

They're not better for miners, they're better for users. Miners want more adoption and thus more transactions from which they can collect fees. The miners tried to compromise and play fairly to ensure that users didn't suffer. Developers don't seem to give a shit. They just want to create a need for their side chain technology so they can sell it and take fees away from miners. 
Maybe the better question would be; Why doesn't core want bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:28:05
I don't believe in "innovation for innovation's sake" is a good argument for LN. In fact, it might possibly be the worst. The simplest and most straightforward solution that everyone understands is bigger blocks. There is no reason whatsoever that bigger blocks could not have been implemented in order to allow for breathing room while all these "innovations" are being created. Meanwhile, because boger blocks are somehow "contentious" despite being known as the solution from day 1, forks are being created by people who disagree with the way Core has decided to attempt to gain control over BTC. 
Segwit and LN, if not outright malicious, are at least the result of incompetence. As a project manager I've seen it a thousand times where a developer or artist get so laser focused on their little corner of the project that they completely disregard the bigger picture. Because Bitcoin has no centralized management team, they have no oversight and no direction. Nobody is there so say "Hey, wait a minute guys, what was our goal again?"

I don't know what you mean by "backwards compatible" in this context. A block size change is a modification to the core fundamentals of the blockchain.

Every "hop" requires that every person in the transaction chain has at least that amount of BTC available in their LN channel so the higher the value transaction, the even lower the chances go that a series of channels will be available to make a transaction. 
Furthermore, this still doesn't solve the problem that an on-chain transaction is *required* in order to open a LN channel to begin with. If you want to send someone BTC whether it be a merchant or individual there is **no reason** that LN will be superior in any way. It will make things slower, reduce privacy by injecting additional people into the transaction and cost more.

I find my methods to be more accurate. I take a single leaf from a fig tree in my next door neighbors yard and drop it off my roof approximately 14.3 feet from the ground. The key here is the temperature and wind speed. If it lands smooth side up I know that bitcoin is going to rise in price, if it lands smooth side down, I immediately divest and resume preparation in my bunker. It hasn't failed me yet!

I think that this is an important distinction. As much as Bitcoin lovers want to regard Bitcoin as a currency, it isn't. Not yet.

To be honest, we're pretty far outside peak trading hours right now. If it's going down at 1am EST I would say it's more likele a DDOS than legitimate traffic.
All that being said, why has nobody suggested that MtGox is "going down" to prevent the selloffs and hope that people cool off their panic mode? Seems like the only time it's been unresponsive has been during steep drops.

That's true, but human psychology on a large scale is always the same and very predictable. The difference here is regulation, and if you know the psychology, you can account for the regulation.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:17:20
I wouldn't deny that it was an organized hit on bitcoin especially with all of the microtransactions and botting that was happening to drive the prices. I have to admit, although it's decentralized and "unregulated" there still needs to be systems in place that prevent overt manipulation or Bitcoin is going to be a target for large(or small) trading corporations and this rollercoaster is going to keep doing what's it's been doing the last couple days.
However, to impose such regulations might go against the very principles behind Bitcoin, so who knows.

Sigh... I don't know why I bother getting involved in these discussions any more but here we are...
You are *assuming* that Bitcoin would "skyrocket in value" if the USD were to crash over night. You have no evidence to support that claim and, typically, when the USD *does* take a dip in value, every commodity it's associated with also drops. IEven if the USD crashed and Bitcoin skyrocketed to $100,000USD/1BTC, what do you think the likelihood of being able to go down to the local car dealership and paying in BTC is right now?
However, that is all beside the point. The person above said:


The answer is an obvious "No" because that vehicle still serves a purpose and has value in it's utility. That vehicle is a **commodity** with an inherent value all on it's own and because it has inherent value, it could be traded for other goods or services.
Where things get confusing is when people start trying to decide if Bitcoin is a currency, a commodity or something in between. Unfortunately, where Bitcoin lies on that scale is a matter of much debate. 
Bitcoin is typically *easier* to compare to basic Stocks because basic stocks have no *real* value of their own, only perceived value given to them by speculators and investors. If we lived in a world where no formal currencies existed, only trade and barter systems, Bitcoin would have never been anything more than a thought in someone's head. Without something like USD to compare it to and investors and speculators to give it a perceived value, Bitcoin would be valueless. Thus, it has zero inherent value.
"Real" currencies have an inherent value(or used to) because it is based on the Gold Standard and gold has a value(as subjective as that value may be, it is still a physical item that has many uses). I won't get into any talk of the bastardization of the Gold Standard, inflation or anything like that because that's not important here.
What you should focus on is *where* Bitcoin's value comes from, what it's based on and who or what things can influence that value. That is how you know what to call it.
For now, the easiest comparison is a stock. Perhaps in the future it can become a currency all it's own. But not yet.
P.S. I will admit that my use of the word "commodity" was incorrect previously so I hope this reply clarifies what I meant.

Yeah and let's all hold hands while we skip down to the local BTC store! 
Arguing that 1 BTC =1 BTC Is about as useful as saying 1 Taco = 1 Taco. 
Bitcoin is a commodity that can be bartered with, not a currency. And that fact will remain true until it sees some semblance of stability. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 07:26:44
So, with your arguments, what would you say that Bitcoin *represents*?
Your argument of currency is purely on technicality. With your logic, if I were to buy a $10,000 dollar car with $10,000 worth of potatoes then you're saying that those potatoes are now a currency. Calling something a currency and using some kind of exchange system to barter goods with it doesn't automatically *make* it a currency.
This is no different than if we came up with some way to use Apple stock to buy groceries. Except in that case, Apple stock actually represents a stake in a company with intrinsic value.
You never did answer my question:

It fascinates me that everyone is talking about how all the alt coins are in a bubble and being "pumped and dumped" while bitcoin's value skyrockets and nobody seems to be worried because it's "legitimate growth". What makes bitcoin's growth any more legitimate? It's just as susceptible to these problems as alt coins.

Bitcoin is in its infancy still. It's rooted solidly in "commodity mode" and the only thing that people do with commodities is hoard them to make a profit or sell and get off the rollercoaster. There will be no spending of Bitcoin until there is some semblance of stability. If I buy something with Bitcoin today and the price doubles tomorrow, I will feel like I overpaid for my item and lost out on potential profits. people that are holding are concerned about profits and people too afraid to continue have already unloaded.

This reminds me of that show back when the internet became a "thing" and there was a crappy reality show where these people lived in an empty house and were only allowed to shop using the internet. Man, I'm so happy I was alive to experience the birth of technology.

Because at the end of this conversation you're stating that a currency is a currency because of what they represent and how widely accepted they are. 
Bitcoin represents nothing *tangible* and the term "widely accepted" is up for interpretation. I don't believe that Bitcoin *is* widely accepted(not yet), and that's why I don't believe it can be considered a currency yet. And you yourself say that you probably would not be able to buy a car with Bitcoin. How widely accepted does something have to be before it's a currency? Cars are quite ubiquitous and every city has a dealership. It seems like it would be a pretty indicator for something like this.
**That** is why I say that it's up for interpretation and widely debated. Your own arguments drive that point even further. At this point I'm just assuming that you're invested in Bitcoin and have have investment bias in addition to being part of the Reddit bubble where your opinion of Bitcoin's popularity is skewed. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:49:28
Thus making that comparison a fallacy. What value does Bitcoin have outside of the it's assigned dollar value? What use does it serve if it's dollar value drops to zero? 
As much as I love Bitcoin and all that it stands for, it's not at the point where it can carry it's own weight as a currency. That's why it's typically referred to as a commodity.

It's in MtGox's interest to keep the price high because they take a percentage. I was just pointing out that nobody has looked at MtGox as the perpetrator in these scenarios. 
Look at current media attention and the fact that although there was a sharp drop in price, people are still interested and that interest has grown. If MtGox were to stall a little bit, let the media take hold and get people on board, they can help reduce the severity of the drop when they finally open up trading again. When it comes to *extremely* volatile trading like Bitcoin is currently, a single day of delay can have a MASSIVE impact.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:27:25
It does make sense. I understand better how a commodity can become a currency. I suppose that Bitcoin is different in the way that it could be argued as a commodity *and* a potential currency. But I think what I was getting at is that as long as it's so readily given value based on existing currencies, it will remain as a commodity. That leap wouldn't be made until, I suppose, Bitcoin encompased more than 50% of an existing economy.
As it stands, and for the foreseeable future, it will be easier to compare it to a stock than a dollar, the only difference being that Bitcoin has a system in place which allows it to be traded simply and directly and the barrier to entry is very low. 
Don't get me wrong, I think it's great and I would love to see Bitcoin succeed. What I don't like to see, though, is fellow redditors and friends overestimating it's value or potential and ending up worse off than when they started. These mania phases can be make-or-break for fragile and volatile things like Bitcoin. With the current state of the world economy, gambling on an idea like Bitcoin and losing is an even bigger setback than it would have been in the past. Further more, Bitcoin's core and principles are very stable, but the trading market is not and is susceptible to manipulation as we've seen recently. This can and will wreak havoc the confidence that Bitcoin needs so very much.
If you have an sources for some good reading on decentralized currency, I would be much obliged.

I understand that Bitcoin and the trading of it are separate entities. My point was that if trading companies or systems aren't stable and are susceptible to manipulation then it has the potential to be fatal for Bitcoin itself.

I had this exact same thing happen to me about 7 years ago when I was running a casual eBay business out of my parent's house. 
One of the buyers reversed the transaction for the sale the day he received the item and said he never received it. Paypal requested the shipping information(which I of course provided) and proceeded to ignore my correspondence. After a few weeks of emails I told Paypal to go fuck themselves, left it at a negative balance, let it hit collections and disputed the collection through a credit agency and got it wiped from my record. My Paypal account is still locked 7 years later, but I don't give a shit. I'll never use Paypal for anything ever again.

If the dollar lost all value overnight, why would Bitcoin do any better? I'm not trolling here, just playing Devil's advocate.
I've said it a few times before, but Bitcoin *currently* is not at "currency" status, it's a "commodity" status because it's used primarily for holding power instead of spending power. The easiest way to compare Bitcoin to "traditional" economic methods is to compare it to stock. I know you Bitcoin fanboys hate this, but a little realism never hurt anybody.
