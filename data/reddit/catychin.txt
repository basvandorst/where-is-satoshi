Let me put this into perspective: The currency is surrounded with uncertainty, no one knows whether it will split or remain intact. Also, the price is showing huge fluctuations, one moment its down, next moment up. Now **you** decide whether it's a good time or bad time to buy ;)

I don't really think you should be trusting a third party with your crypto - Take it out and Transfer it to an offline wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:58:03

The selection is not based on the market cap. I found these icons sexy; thats it. Besides, are you really bothered by 7 images in 2 rows? I mean really really?
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:52:08
Were  the bitcoins you paid pre-hardfork or post-hardfork?
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:00:46
Been seeing a lot of complaints about lately, not sure whats up with Trezor
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:23:58
My plan is to not let anyone know that I hold bitcoins ... xD
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:19:34
Don't sell now; you won't make much. Wait for the price to double - which wouldn't take more than a year in my opinion - and then sell them. Thank me later ;)

Of course, I will buy. But not now, now, now! Will do it when I think the time is right, right, right. xD

Biggest advantage: its cool and gives you something to brag in front of your friends, lol. Other than that, it's a great investment opportunity with the potential of turning you millionaire overnight.
If you are serious about buying Bitcoin, don't give it much of a thought and do the purchasing right now. One of the reliable Bitcoin buying sites I came across during my venture was btcneversleeps.com
Good Luck!
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:20:29
It's all just a hype. Nothing else. First, we spent the whole year speculating about Hard Fork and now people are coming up with this, I would only believe this when something does happen outside the discussion forums. Until then, I'm not moving anything related to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:23:12
Not steady. It's still showing fluctuations. last time I observed Bitcoin's value was Friday when it cost over $2400/BTC, now its somewhere around $2,800/BTC. Not steady at all.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:42:50

I agree with just half of his prediction: Bitcoin will reach $500,000 per BTC. But not in three years. Three years is way too short a time to go this high. Maybe in a decade or two, but not in what JM said. No chance!
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:06:46
WTF is this thread all about? :'D
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:01:30
Lucky Poland! My country still sees Bitcoin as something cursed. Guess i'll have to wait a little longer to buy pizza with BTC in my hometown, lol.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:43:45
Because it was all just the hype, nothing was ever going to happen to begin with.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:02:52
Don't really care about Bitcoin. I am  and would remain so regardless of whatever happens to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:05:40
Depends on how you define ideal money. For me, the ideal money is: hard to steal, can give you humongous returns over a short span of time, and doesn't rot in wallets. Bitcoin has it all. so, Bitcoin is the ideal money for me. However, its just my opinion and you have all the rights to differ.
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:19:45
I would use a hardware wallet. This is due to their less vulnerability to hacking attacks and other online threats. My recommendation on hardware wallets would either be Ledger Nano S, KeepKey, or Trezor.
Yes, most 2FA wallets are secure and don't really pose any threat to your coins.
It's always better to have your assets distributed instead of putting them all into one bucket for obvious reasons.
Good luck with your purchase!
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:27:26
It's not like paper wallets are becoming extinct. You can still move coins to a paper wallet of your choice or just keep them where they currently are, totally up to you.

Maybe Bitcoin. no? okay!
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:39:11
In a sense of huge gains, yes it is. But as a technology, BTC is just warming up. Just in the beginning of its route. Once Bitcoin hits its true potential, it will be very difficult for anyone to shut it down.

@_date: 2017-07-25 08:13:39
Since we're gonna have two separate coins after the fork, both will have different values. It all depends on how much you sell those coins for, and whether or not both the coins have the same demand. If one coin becomes dominant, the other will struggle for value.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:50:14
