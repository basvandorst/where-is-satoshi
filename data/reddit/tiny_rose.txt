we've come so far. You could buy a complete franchise of a local pizza chain with a btc or two now.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:28:39
It was thing here before.
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:00:24
moon seems quite far.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:54:48
Good luck mate, never buy into FUD.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:56:07
Short BTC if you think a dump is coming and long it if you think a pump is coming.
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:36:46
Yup, you are wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:34:23
We don't need governments. They can ban it we may take a hit but we will sustain.
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:09:06
Remarkable! 
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:32:24
How can i answer why are you buying it?
@_date: 2018-05-27 08:43:43
Pretty much.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:04:57
as far as I have read they can but it's still beta
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:03:44
They banned it because google and youtube did it.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:22:30
I meant don't buy the FUD.
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:44:17
It's a mistake itself.

Happy to see more ways for new money to enter!
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:30:35
It's your fault for listening.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:24:20
Have been listening that since Jan.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:10:31
Spread the word.
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:02:38
I think the price is pretty low and good entry point.
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:22:20
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:50:42
Because greed.
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:03:20
What did you smoke?
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:22:30
I think it would have made more sense if we were at $6.9k
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:01:51
Sad, you're getting a down vote but this is true. Maybe some crypto will solve this.
@_date: 2018-06-12 08:09:45
in for the tech that makes us money
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:18:53
How is 2018 similar to 2014 crash?
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:28:58
I've lost so much trying to time the market and I finally get it a bit.
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:24:26
The most stable currency much wow.
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:05:55
The irony!
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:38:24
Price discovery?
@_date: 2018-06-03 09:47:14
I think little too early to call it a rally.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:46:29
Well, 400$ dip is different from 20k to 6k
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:16:09
That just makes the bleed more painful you know?
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:58:56
I've seen many in toronto too but sadly no one uses them.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:27:02
or maybe they need better servers
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:04:21
Was thinking the same thing, maybe there wont be much dumping this year after this?
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:25:06
Amazing partnership, will make things a whole lot easier for folks in UK when it comes to withdrawing.
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:28:48
That's actually brilliant.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:54:46
If you are that worried about it then make some offline copies on a paper or something and keep them safe somewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:08:10
Looks like a green and better day to me.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:40:53
That's my current too, keep the patience and don't stop going.
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:16:45
Too old news for me.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:33:08
So many new exchanges features coming to UK thesedays.
