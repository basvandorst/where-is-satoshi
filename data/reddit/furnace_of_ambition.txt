Thanks, on the deposit page it said only 3. How did you find that out? Is it on their site somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:05:49
Hope it wasn't mt gox lol

I agree with you. At first I thought that the announcement was positive. But the more I thought about it, the big money will go into futures instead, and they have the $ and the means to manipulate the price while making a fortune on it's way down.

Yes, but Yeezy website freezing doesn't cause people to lose potentially tens of thousands of dollars in opportunity cost. This is a major flaw that needs to be addressed and not written off don't you agree?

thanks, no info on new coins yet but I'll see if they update it in the next week or so.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:44:14
Sure I could get those but there were 3 or 4 new Bitcoin forks in the last few days. I haven't seen or heard of any ledger support for these yet.

I generally do hodl off the exchange but when a large correction seems overdue I start moving coin to Bittrex in preparation for the swing.
Thank you, and good luck to you as well.

88.48 sat/B is what it says on the transaction information. I just meant that on ledger wallet I selected the option that says 'highest fee.' It has a custom fee option but I didn't want to screw anything up.

Thank you so much for your help. My transaction has gone through now and it's such a huge relief! I definitely learned a lot from you and now I'll be able to avoid this confusion in the future. I really appreciate it!

When they 'forecast' a value for January how is that not a prediction. I said 'what happens when they decide to propose an extreme correction', as in when they 'forecast' a much lower price.

Yes I have noticed this as well. It seems very likely that your speculation is true. Of course this is the risk we take when entering an unregulated market, but it is unnerving to say the least.

I'm feeling like such a noob right now.. I'm trying to understand how that chart works. If I'm looking at the pending transaction fee chart, does mine fall under the 70+ category? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:49:47
I probably should make a better habit of setting stop losses. The volatility has caused me to avoid them as I've gotten burned a few times.

don't know if id use it for a wallet but it looks awesome

Lol.. like this post for the 100,000th time.. this sub has been this way for at least a year as far as I know. Pretty sure it's not something that will change. Who cares about tech etc. when your down a lot of money! This 'bear' market has been a great learning experience and hopefully all of those out there complaining about price have used this opportunity to better prepare for next time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:06
I sense a lot of FUD in stock boys. Could it be you are concerned that crypto will be the catalyst for your next major bear market. It likely will be. 
If your mad now you will really be mad this time next year.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:00:47
So how is its surge unwarranted by the fundamentals?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:22:48
it's incredibly stressful... just don't know where the 'safe haven' is atm. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:47
Are you... pizza guy?!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:23:45
Yes, I bought my first Bitcoin a 2 weeks before china ban. Taught me a lot about stress management lol. 11.3k to 8.7k in a matter of a few hours is a massive daily swing if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:11:30
Well today was one hell of a swing. If it brings a bit of stabilization to Bitcoin that would be a nice benefit I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:59:02
Thanks. It seems like a lot of people have pointed out that futures is good news for BTC and seem excited about it. I just don't understand why it would be good. If anything it seems bad because people who don't trust BTC will just buy futures instead.
