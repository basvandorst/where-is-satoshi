Pump and dump by preying on people's insecurities. Imagine that.

Maybe this isn't the place for it, but can't mods just use dummy accounts to shirk responsibility for their actions?

He probably see them as an investment. He may not use it for day to day expenses.

people know that thousands of coins were just stolen, and that those coins likely came from someone just like them...that trusted a website and was AGAIN totally ruined due to the supposed "features" of an unregulated, anonymous currency.
And people like you that make idiotic excuses for the coin and for the way its used are kidding yourselves if you think that some serious behavior changes are in order before crypto currencies are ever taken seriously.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:25:32
These continuing types of events are going to ruin bitcoin, and possibly cryptocurrencies in general.

Ah, sorry I misunderstood. Definitely something we should get worked out before the donations start pouring in.
In the meantime, I made a paypal donation directly to Warner K.

Right, right, and 10,000 tomorrow right? Listen I own, bitcoin (and I'm in it for the long haul) but all the people being so naively optimistic are just as retarded as the ones being overly negative. When a bunch of wall street asshats start giving endorsements, it's not good for the currency...it's just good the price (for a little while) and they all sell and it loses 20% of its value overnight.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:24:05
But gold's value is not currently determined by those manufacturing uses, so again I ask how it is different than the gold market....
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:14:38
Well you also cited an airline, so I thought you were speaking more to whole Pepsi/Coke argument that users cling to. The social network example is not terribly flawed because at least it acknowledges the value of a wide user base, but again I think file formats is a more accurate analogy. Products/Services tend to be more about quality of experience, whereas file formats tend to be more about widespread adoption and underlying financial backing. 
Also, I never said Bitcoins userbase was some tremendous number. That really isn't relevant. What's relevant is that it has the biggest userbase, and has mainstream recognition. Nobody outside of the cc comunity even knows what litecoin is or how it's different than bitcoin. If during a downturn the bitcoin userbase shrunk, the litecoin userbase would shrink at least the same rate (but starting from a smaller original number)

No one expected them to endorse it, but few people expected them to come out and say "you cannot use this as a legal currency" meaning that it could impact how merchants interact with bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:48:02
At some point gold was not valuable, but it's rarity and easy transportability started it's popularity as a holder of value. There's a number of books on the subject. I see bitcoin as similiar...it's answering an economic question. It's intrinsic value is not rarity + manufacturing uses, but rather it's rarity + transactional features 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:38:11


I never said it did?


I agree, which I said up front. It's like the mp3...it wasn't necessarily better than other digital music formats, it was just the most widely adopted. Obviously its main value was being better than CDs, but it stuck around because of the snowball effect of user-adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:31:42
Right, just checking. Doesn't it scare you that there's always a 4 day delay on your purchases? Seems like your market agility is hampered pretty bad that way...
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:17:54
Yeah I mean, assuming it's all blue chip stocks and safer bonds then at best you can expect 4%. Thats about 40k a  year, which is like living as a first year out of college graduate with a job. I mean, it's not a terrible way to live if you can find somewhere cheap but it's certainly not hamming it up and you aren't adding to your principle so in the long run it just seems stupid
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:06:54
Was just wondering the same thing
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:01:48
there is an app to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-25 15:57:23
pm me the details and we can talk about it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:46:22
Sorry, to clarify: there won't be 1 or 2 competitiors, there will be 1 or 2 clear runaway competitors that will make the other 48 irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:00:24
how do you buy your coins so quickly?
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:11:39
It's comments like this that keep me over in Y'all are so desperately into bitcoin, and have so much time and money invested in it that you can't see the forest for the trees. When you start shitting on big national bank chains, all I see is "I am a small time financial entity who does not understand the importance of a easy-to-access, national banking system"
A lot of banks offer better, more convenient service than even the best credit unions. Back when I lived in a college town, the local credit union was very convenient. When I moved into a big city with no local coverage? It became extremely inconvenient.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:30:22
Not sure, but yeah..my point exactly. Getting some job you just really like or starting your own small business seems a way better use of the million than attempting to flat-out retire.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:11:00
Yesterday was insane. Certain people on should feel embarrassed about yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 15:59:30
Maybe they realized their government simply won't allow bitcoin to flourish and are divesting. It doesn't make bitcoin any less viable for every other person on the planet...
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:24:48
First, the divisibility of bitcoins is exceptional. It will take a long time before the lowest divisibility of a bitcoin is unacceptable as a currency. Eventually I do see 1 or 2 competitors, not 50. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:49:51
Exactly. Arguably its very slow, almost negligibly slow, to mine gold. yet gold does have value due to it's rarity.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:32:03
You say that like it's a good thing? just wait till it starts getting manipulated by Wall Street (more than it already is)
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:41:23
I don't believe it's accurate to treat currencies like brands or products. It's more accurate to think of currency as a file format...like betamax vs vhs. The reasoning is simple: sharing a currency is more like sharing a file format. For the currency to be useful, it doesn't need to be the absolute best, it just needs to be widely adopted. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:23:48
go on coinbase and do it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:03:55
The same reason bitcoin's price is higher than litecoin, I suppose. The one with the larger number of users will typically win out and start to snowball.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:14:18
I think we're just misunderstanding each other's hypothesis. I'm not saying that bitcoin is widely adopted, just that bitcoin is the most widely adopted crypto-currency. You're right that the long-term longevity of bitcoin is rooted in it's ability to become widely adopted not just by crypto-currency standards, but by the standards of all currency in circulation today. I agree that long-term we need to see adoption of bitcoin by far, far more people in order to ensure that bitcoin's price continue to rise (or at least stabilize) rather than head towards zero.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:39:43
Just to play devils advocate, how is that so different than the gold market?
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:38:37
If anyone wants a prepaid visa, you can send me bitcoin and i'll fuckin MAIL you the card. Any amount up to a thousand dollars.
Seriously, those fees are just about dumb enough to make this plan seem plausible.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:16:46
Yeah, seriously. I bought 1 at around 400. I thought I was insane for doing it. I still feel insane for doing it. I figure either the price will continue to climb, or the government will destroy it and I'll have lost everything I put in. For me, it feels very all or nothing.
