Let’s say amazon sets up shop on the lightning network. In what direction do you think funds would flow? Do you think it will flow evenly in both directions, or is it mainly a one way directional flow?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:54:46
A client implements the protocol. The protocol doesn't exist on its own. The Bitcoin core devs maintain the protocol as is defined in the Bitcoin core code base

Okay chucklefuck why don’t you explain how exchanges make money 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:53:56
 You can’t send funds without first funding the channel. So you fund $1000 to the bank and then “take it back” so the ledger shows you have $1000 to spend(ledger wise). The actual bitcoin is in the hands of the bank. So it’s exactly like a bank. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:10:00
No, it can be answered. There’s a general lightning network code base on github that mainnet and testnet are running on. Implementing that code is not the same as writing the code. Obviously you don’t know much about programming. 
So my question is when will version 1.0 be released? Don’t reply with some dumbass shit about implementing the code because that’s got not a thing to do with the software development. Maybe somebody who actually knows what they’re talking about can reply 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:16:28
Bitch, the core devs maintain the mother fucking Bitcoin core codebase which includes the god damn protocol. The protocol is defined by the code itself so your Microsoft and Casio analogies are stupid as fuck and make no sense


Nope it doesn't need to be wide spread it just needs a few nodes and a miner. Bitcoin Cash was created with an arguably worse implementation, the community is far smaller than Bitcoin yet it exists. 
Guess what? There's been no change to the Bitcoin protocol with the release of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork you dumb ignorant mother fucker.

From a technological standpoint, it could have happened. The miners suppportrd it so there would have been no technical issues with segwit2x. But a bunch of whiny ass babies cried about it because joe blow might not be able to run a node on his CenturyLink internet anymore so omg totes a valid reason to cripple a $300 billion currency, fucking idiots. 
The devs pulled out not the miners and it was a mistake. The blocksize still needs an increase and now we have high fees. Great job guys!

No a hard fork requires miners to support it. It doesn’t require every bitcoin user. A developer absolutely can make a fucking change and if the miners support it, it can happen.

Every node does have to download the entire blockchain to operate. A wallet is not a node. 
What she’s wrong about is that the same will be true for the lightning network too. Every node will need to download the lightning network blockchain and store every too. The thing that’s inefficient about bitcoin is block mining. The difficulty increases requiring greater mining power

Then your crypto was not used as collateral. Most likely listed as assets 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:32:48
It has to be. There’s no other effective way for the system to work. Look at it from a end user perspective, unless you’re constantly opening and closing channels, thus defeating the whole purpose of the LN an end user will need to open a channel with a large amount of funds and then need a trusted way for those funds come back to the user so the user can actually spend in his channel. The only trusted way is to do it with an exchange that holds deposits. Exchanges will be those large centralized hubs. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:55:32
Many wallets support segwit. A lot of exchanges have stated they will not adopt segwit until it’s fully implemented in bitcoin core so the core dev team needs to make it a priority

Just so people understand, and there’s nothing wrong with it, the author is saying their will be large centralized lightning network hubs where all the bitcoin will actually be stored. It’s the only way for the whole thing to work but the blockchain will remain decentralized 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:48:46
Nooo. A channel can only transact as much held by the channel. Now assuming a channel is connected to a big merchant like an exchange will make that hub very useful but you still have s problem of initial channel opening and channel funding which then kills any benefit you would get.

It is and exchanges will have to be banks essentially. You’ll fund your bank account with a large amount of bitcoin and then make payments through other nodes connected to your bitcoin bank(exchange). 
That means those nodes will holds hundreds if not millions of dollars. Those nodes better be stronger than Fort Knox or the whole entire network will collapse

@_date: 2018-01-04 03:29:52
Yup he sure did 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:26:57
Yes because the only way for it to work is for funds to flow through larger centralized hubs. If joe blow has .01 btc in his channel and you want to send .02 bitcoin you’re not getting it through Joe’s channel. The only channels with shit loads of bitcoin are going to have to be large hubs 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:13:07

You can’t put more money through a channel than was initially funded so unless you start off your first channel with a big upfront funding you’re not getting much benefit from ln. 
Also ln will then require large centralized banking hubs to operate efficiently therefore defeating the fucking purpose but lol LN is all bitcoin has.

Isn’t that tweet backwards. If you oppose a block size increase but you support segwit then you support increasing the block size! Stupid hypocritical fuck. 
People who oppose segwit don’t do so out of principle. They oppose it because Segwit doesn’t go far enough and isn’t being adopted by enough people to change anything. There’s nothing hypocritical about that! Fees are still high and there’s still a huge backlog on the mempool.

@_date: 2018-01-16 05:12:42
Yes. The security part is if you broadcast an old tx the signature will be rejected by the node and supposed forfeiture of funds. It’s not clear how that will work when a user has spent all its funds in the channel.
 Supposedly there is some sort of reserve you can’t spend when the channel is funded, at least that’s what the white paper says. But that presents a huge problem. Either you’ve got a decent amount in reserve that you can’t touch which will piss off a lot of people and make them not want to use it or the reserve is insignificant thus not an effective security measure. 
Probably the node will just recognize the signature as invalid and reject the transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:38:14

Xe.com can do the same and with ZERO fees. Bitcoin has fees as high as 100% - 120%
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:17:51
Technically the devs said a month ago they released a release candidate but it’s full of bugs and doesn’t fully implement the features from the white paper so it is alpha software but they’re lying about it and saying it’s ready for production. 
They act like condescending assholes if you ask when the network will be ready for production

Lol you spending money you don’t have is your own dumbass fault
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:00:30
Not only that but there will be a blockchain fee and a lightning fee. 
The saturation will be reduced by users and exchanges where the bulk of txs come from now buying and selling wouldn’t mean a on chain tx every time unless the balance is too low or exceeds the initial funding. So how beneficial lightning network truly will be remains to be seen. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:40:03
Well the supply of bitcoins is still increasing so ops is wrong but bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralized currency but it’s network can’t support that purpose but it’s also supposed to be a store of value. Logic isn’t strong with these people

Yes with a public blockchain your txs aren’t anonymous and is a problem with bitcoin itself.  This doesn’t have a damn thing to do with an exchange. Regulators are going after wallets, not exchanges. 
I can create a private wallet and there’s not a damn thing any regulator can do to prove I own it

Jesus fuck dude you are so stupid and poorly informed about bitcoin. Your childish ranting about Coinbase is sad and pathetic
Coinbase is a bank and an exchange but nobody makes you use that exchange. Plenty of other ones exist that are far better. Vote with your wallet and get off Coinbase. 
Coinbase doesn’t spy on you and doesn’t know more about you than your bank does. This is the dumbest shit I’ve read on this sub and I’ve read a lot of dumb ass shit on here. You can send money to a different wallet and Coinbase has no way of knowing who owns that wallet. You can’t send money to an anonymous person with your bank account you stupid fucking retard. 
You don’t need to keep your money or coins with Coinbase. Literally nothing stopping people from pulling them from Coinbase. 
The whole reason you children are CRYING right now is because the price of bitcoin ranked and it’s momentum has been killed. If you truly bought into bitcoin as a currency you wouldn’t care that it’s price dipped because the price dip has no bearing on bitcoin as an instrument. 
BUT YOU DO CARE. You care because you want to make money and bitcoin cash has interfered with bitcoin’s massive growth. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:43:38
This is growing by about 20-30k transactions a day right now. But don’t worry guys In a couple years lightning network will be available 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:13:35
They put $11 million into it. They also created Gemini(which has low low fees btw)and they’re the ones, through Gemini, supporting the futures contracts. Either bitcoin goes up like they say or it comes crashing down when Wall Street shorts it and they lose everything 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:25:29
lol you can't just run a node like downloading a program. It takes far more space and processing power, essentially all that you have and even then a regular desktop is a very inefficient miner which is why they have specialized asic miners. We don't need more nodes, we need segwit to be hard forked on Bitcoin. Don't blame this on the user base, this is on the devs
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:24:40
just give your $50 straight to coinbase. It'll be less frustrating than losing all of it to fees
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:57:48
Did you buy in at $16k? $15k? Lol how much do you enjoy losing money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:14:21


Lightning network has been six months away for about 2 years now. I'm not holding my breath for this thing to materialize. 
Outside of that its either exchanges adopt Segwit which they don't seem keen on doing anytime soon or we go back to forcing Segwit2x on everybody which for some reason the community is whines and cries about Segwit2x. Because, oh god, an increased block size and adoption of Segwit. Why, that would reduce tx times and fees!!! And we all don't want that, right! No we want magic lightning network. Let's just sit on our asses and wait another three years for it. Meanwhile Bitcoin is down 35%. No biggie because all these stupid fucks that have $100 invested in it feel the need to call the shots
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:43:24
No the devs maintain bitcoin core which is the fucking protocol 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:52:19
No you’re not. LN will have fees, the blockchain will still have god damn fees. Nothing is free
It’s not decentralized. It’s as inflation proof as any other commodity yet unlike every other commodity bitcoin has no intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:38
No where in my post have I diverted. If I want to talk about whatever else I want to talk about though I will without needing permission from you 
The public blockchain is not an extensive surveillance tool. If you think talking about the public blockchain is diverting the conversation then clearly you are ignorant as to how bitcoin works. 
The federal government is going to tie wallets to people for purposes of anti money laundering and and to try to determine capital gains/losses. Tough shit. 
90% of people using bitcoin use it as an investment. The IRS already has records on users from the exchanges and they know the amounts coming from the exchanges into bank accounts. Your dumbass rambling about bitcoin banks has no bearing on most people 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:46:25
Yeah that’s down from 300k 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:24

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:39:56
Uh nobody said you have to buy from Coinbase. 
This childish attitude from so many bitcoin users reflects poorly on the crypto itself. It’s as immature as the user base 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:13
Yes the high fees and large unconfirmed txs are not good for bitcoin. Really bitcoin has few advantages at this point but I’m hopeful segwit will be implemented reducing those issues. Probably many months away, until then “hodl”
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:15:18
Yet one exchange trading a new crypto caused the price to drop 20% but hey guys the government can’t issue bitcoin so it’s all good

You realize that Bitcoin is a commodity and that price goes up or down based on market value, right? So if got your paycheck in Bitcoins and the price of was around $20k when you got paid, your bitcoin is now worth 30% less than when you were paid. LOL you think that's better than fiat? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:55:40
Bitcoin is not a social movement. You’ve got delusions of grandeur if you think it is. Bitcoin will never be legal tender. Bitcoin will never taken seriously. Bitcoin will never see mass adoption. 
Bitcoin is an investment vehicle so the ones who have the loudest voice are the ones with the most money. They decide what happens to bitcoin. Bitcoin is still growing rapidly so those at the top won’t make any changes because they want people to continue to pump money into bitcoin. Only after people get pissed and volume starts declining will you see changes to bitcoin

Nooo. The bank accounts that hold money for you in the Coinbase exchange are fdic insured. 
Even then the fdic has fuck all to do with investments. Just because FDIC ensures your cash deposits in the exchange doesn’t mean the government can regulate them.

@_date: 2017-12-31 16:47:52
If they disappear you lose a shit ton of capacity. Some left for bcash and the unconfirmed txs spiked to 300k. 
Many have come back because with the retardedly high tx fees bitcoin is more profitable than bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:49
what the fuck are you talking about? Who bought in at 19k and then hoped it dropped? Are you a fucking retard? 
People are complaining because their investment they put money into at $19k is now worth 25% less. Of course they're upset
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:32
Cause no bad actor would ever run a compromised node 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:32:40
$18k right here. I’ve got $10k invested at that. But looking long term I’m optimistic 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:00
Gotta love how this community doesn’t want to acknowledge the massive influx of demand, doesn’t want to increase block size nor explore other cryptos like bcash but they want low fees and instant txs. Dumb. Fucks. The whole lot of them 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:43
good for you to say when you haven't lost money. Fuck everybody else, I got mines.

Because bitcoin can’t increase exponentially forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:51
Yup. Nah miners should be altruistic because bitcoin is the one true crypto and all others are sucky
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:18:14
So all I’m hearing from “crypto is a currency not a get rich scheme” people is crying about bcash affecting their ability to make money from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:44
This kills the bitcoin.

Banks have fuck all to do with inflation. With the price of bitcoin being tied to USD you have the same inflation issue. Great argument, numb nuts
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:25:45
Yeah but you can bulk process txs on the channel which should lower the fees in theory. 
Ln code based is not even fully developed. It’s months of not years away 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:29:17
Then small transactions are never transferred you dolt. The only way a merchant actually gets bitcoin in their wallet is through the block chain. It’s why LN creates two block chain transactions one to open the channel and the other to close it. When the channel is closed that is when funds are transferred out of the LN and to the recipient

@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:22
Cool so I’ll go on bisq and pay higher tx fees than Coinbase without the benefit of instant buying/selling. Cool it’s exactly what will replace an exchange

Your tx didn’t process
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:17:28
Banks do not create money with a loan. Interest does not create money out of thin air. Interest and inflation are not the same thing, not even close. 
Bitcoin is a commodity and it’s value is tied to usd. Metals, gems, etc aren’t currency you dolt. With high fees and high processing times bitcoin can’t even function as a currency, it’s intended purpose lmao
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:24:58
Before you could mine bitcoin with a consumer gpu. You can’t do that now

I’m gonna guess it went to the depositable adddress
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:22:42
Mmm no. Bitmain wanted bitcoin cash and bitmain being one of the largest mining ops in bitcoin the developers got on board and pushed a hard fork without a strong consensus from the community. Nobody ever said one guy could control the protocol. Don’t go twisting words  
Core devs just need the support of large mining ops like bitmain to make changes. That’s not decentralized, that’s the exact opposite. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:07:14
ya. And if the price of bitcoin was at $20k or $25k right now I'd be patting myself on the back and gloating. Hindsight is 20/20

Lol redditor for two weeks I’ve bet you’ve got $100 invested and think that makes you qualified to speak in bitcoin. Thing is I make enough money I can absorb a $1k loss over the next few months but I’m betting bitcoin goes up enough I won’t lose a dime. 
But none of that changes you from being a dumbass lmao

Oh she is? Because apparently lightning is up and running for testing but she can’t articulate what’s holding it back from release or give any sort of timeline. There’s no guarantee lightning will deliver what it promises. She’s making crypto happen just as much as my cat is. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:22:31
That’s what seg was for. When the limit is hit an update will be released increasing the number of bitcoins. 
This will seriously devalue the currency for a period of time and create mass chaos. So business as usual in bitcoin world

Blockchain increases to 2mb under segwit. Why the fuck isn’t segwit a hard fork now? High fees and unconfirmed tx are killing bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:58:31
Btc is lower not rising 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:54
Coinbase makes money off tx fees.
 That being said, Coinbase was on board to support segwit2x BUT THIS COMMUNITY WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO IT. Fuck off. So many complained about how bad segwit2x was gonna be that the devs scrapped the plans for it. Now you sane people are complaining it wasn’t done. How about y’all just stfu 
 Bcash will ultimately be good for bitcoin because it will hopefully lower the incredibly strained load put in bitcoin right now. Bcash has low tx fees and processes trans very quickly. 
Sorry but bitcoin isn’t equipped to handle this high demand. Either it adapts or it dies and right now it’s not adapting. Hodling for LN to come online isn’t good enough. That’s years away for it to be fully functional when a solution is needed yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:01
Those miners are some bastards, I tell ya. 
I've been watching this for the past few hours and it will swing from 2-4tx per sec up to 11-14 and then drop back down again to 2-4. That massive swing in processing power shows how unreliable bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:40
They were onboard with SegWit2x and look what happened there. From what I understand none of the exchanges are using SegWit and that's the problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:08:36
Um, no.
For one, its 145gb file you have to download. If you live in an area with data caps you're fucked. This isn't a small program
you have to leave it running all the time.  With how difficult it is to mine a block these days its not very efficient for your computer to do so
But it does help the network and will help to speed up tx times so you know what, if you want to do it go for it. But this isn't the solution to bitcoin's problem. The devs needs to implement something within weeks or Bitcoin will continue to crash and burn
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:14:32
Bitcoin will go to zero before the dollar will. There is less value in a crypto than a fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:49:29
No the fuck were not 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:37
why is there liquidity issues? Because people don't use decentralized exchanges. You can't even find a single decentralized one on the web which eliminates the chance of it being used by people by 90% and that's because there's zero market for a decentralized exchange and for good reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:39
Nope! Bitcoin isn’t a security!

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:42
Uh do people not realize how bitcoin works? Right now the block chain is powered by miners. If there is no more bitcoin to mine then miners will leave and transactions will not be processed. This kills bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:34:34
Your limit order was filled.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:59:19
So then it was a good idea 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:05:18
I don’t blame you. The miners and exchanges got greedy with high fees and its killing bitcoin. The only solution is lightning which could be here in six months or it could be two years. At this point there’s no reason to invest in bitcoin right now. It rose to quick and the bubble popped. I just feel stupid for listening to the “bitcoin will be at $20k by 2018” people. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:02
ehhh I'm negative $1500 USD right now. At this point I've accepted reality and there's nothing I can do but wait for the price to go back up. I've got an open limit order to sell once it reaches a certain price and now I just have to playing the waiting game. This alleviates a lot of stress for me
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:36

A credit card pre auth is instant which functions similarly to what the lightning network is promising. 
Bitcoin tx can take days to be fully processed. There’s 300k in queue right now. It’s not instant, not even close 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:43:14
A decentralized exchange exists but people don’t want it. That’s why a centralized exchange is popular and the decentralized one isn’t. People can choose what to use, see how that works?

A 1tb hard drive is $45. A fucking bitcoin fee can cost more than a 1tb hard drive. Saying the disk space is an issue is such a stupid and ridiculous argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:58:04
what fundamental monetary system? Its a digital currency that right now is being powered by China.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:38:56
They’re still getting free money or bitcoin or whatever

Take off your jacket 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:51:22
hindsight is 20/20. If Bitcoin were at $20k right now I would be up over $1,000. Fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:27:15
Yes to your first question
No to your second 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:47
He seems pretty happy 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:24:10
Just remember you haven’t lost anything until you sell. Hodl strong, brother. I myself am down about $700 right now. Bitcoin price will hopefully recover. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:13:28
How does a bad actor lose by default? What stops a bad actor from running a node designed to steal all funds in a hot wallet? 
This is a major security flaw with lightning network that has to be fixed before LN will be ready for production 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:55
Because you touch yourself at night. This is all your fault 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:38
Gemini. Very low fees, quick identity confirmation. 
Cons: no mobile app, only supports bitcoin and ether 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:31
Well fraud is the biggest reason. There's very little protection against charge backs and since bitcoin currency trades are irreversible there's nothing you can do if somebody buys bitcoin and then the bank issues a charge back. 
On the flip side, you can send money to a trader and then that trader can decide to keep your money and bitcoin. This requires a mediator to step in and enforce action, which require some sort of advanced deposit which would then require an initial upfront deposit of a significant amount of money. It's not practical 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:48
I’m already on Gemini. I haven’t traded on Coinbase in two weeks. 
My point is bisq is not a practical solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:32
What happens to the hot wallet on an offline node? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:44
Can someone actually articulate why it was bad? There was a lot of fud spread about it for no good reason. Segwit2x would have fixed a lot of the problems bitcoin has right now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:49
Lol bitcoin is decentralized and can’t be controlled by governments 
*something shady happens
Where’s the government to step in?????
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:10:56
If price drops from 19k to 15k to 13k then this is a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:15:19
He has to settle let’s say 100 coins at $50k a piece. If bitcoin is above 50 he profits, below and he loses
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:58:00
And pay 10x the cost. There’s ideal and then there’s practical 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:25
Bitcoin is the one true crypto how come others can put their money where I don’t want them to reeeeeee
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:43:25
If we increase the block size fewer nodes are necessary. If they’re aren’t enough nodes then more will be brought online. 
People don’t like that because it would mean the miners have more power but that’s exactly the god damn point. There’s 300k unconfirmed transactions and fees are ridiculously high. Bitcoiners would cut their nose off to spite the face because this community is full of whiny man children. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:24:37
Lol the only store of value bitcoin has is the fiat that’s put into it. People use bitcoin to trade fiat digitally and as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin is a commodity, it’s not going to end banking or fiat currency. Thinking so is retarded 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:09:30
If you at look from a rational non emotional perspective, bitcoin cash is the better crypto right now. It’s fees are significantly lower, tx process days faster too boot and it scales better than bitcoin does. 
Bitcoin needs to get its shit together fast and adapt or it will be left behind. Telling people to wait a couple years for LN to be realized is not a good enough answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:25:04
The blockchain is only 145gb 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:13:31
And those are different people you fucking moron. Some wanted it to drop, others wanted it to go up. People who are upset now weren’t wanting it to drop before you fucking retard
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:36:01
no. The nodes/miners have to support SegWit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:10
Lol they didn’t manipulate anything. If bitcoin wasn’t so god damn fragile it wouldn’t have been a problem. People need to quit crying over a free market 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:20:43
Mmm no a good actor could be running a compromised node unknowingly. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:20:43
Transfers are processed based off fee. It won’t be processed until a miner agrees to process at that price. I don’t know what the going rate is but I’d guess it’s a lot higher and with all the volume probably will be a while until a miner gets to it 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:04:31
Which you can’t do right now because the tx fees are too high. On top of that the network can’t support millions of low fee tx. But you feel entitled so by all means that should trump practically and rational thinking 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:01
post wallet address or GTFO
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:30:38
Stop pay. Banks charge a fee for it 
 Coinbase will close your account or force you to reverify your bank account 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:45:29
Mining can be profitable elsewhere now, especially with the high fees but you don’t recoup your investment for years do nobody wants to get involved. Without the Chinese you really wouldn’t have bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:23:40
As someone who has $10k invested at $18k bitcoin price point, no I don’t think bitcoin is doing just fine but I might be biased 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:03:20
He has 50% of one fund not 50% of all his investments 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:34:14
This analogy doesn’t make sense because bitcoin isn’t tangible 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:22:56
Le bitcoin is going to le crash - media every day for the past year 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:37:52
So is the protocol maintained by bitcoin core devs or not? Are you really going to argue that and then tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:49:09
To steal money 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:17:48
Because fuck you, that’s why 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:40:53
It will only take five years to do it! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:56:18
Now $18.8k
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:49:38
Eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:33:58
Yes they fucking are! What is with the god damn opposition to increasing the fucking blocksize. Double it and force segwit and you will see tx times drop dramtically and fees to drop dramatically as well
or being a stubborn little bitch, oppose any practical and short term solution to solve the bitcoin problem and watch as Bitcoin crashes and burns. 
Segwit2x was fine and should have been adopted. This childish rejection of change is fucking stupid and it's what is killing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:23:48
Yup. I hope you read it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:17:03
Because I'm down about $1500 right now but that's not real until I sell lol. 
I completely agree with you though. The high fees and tx processing times are killing bitcoin but the miners and exchanges don't care because they're rolling in the money at our expense. Short sighted greed will cost them in the long run. 
Lightning network has been six months away for over a year now. Lightning first started back in April 2016. That's right. LN has been talked about for almost two years now and it's still in ALPHA. 
Bitcoin devs and exchanges don't care about you or me or even Bitcoin. They just want to make money. Make no mistake, the devs are beholden to the investors and the exchanges and right now they're making tons of money off fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:41:25
Did you have s stroke during the middle of your sentence?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:01:37
Bitcoin value is derived from what people are willing to pay for it. That value is derived from what people expect they can profit from It. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:50
Bro lightning network. Bro, decentralized. BRO CRYPTO. Buzz words means bitcoin has no issues, okay? Bitcoin is perfect and if you criticize it then you’re roger ver. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:56:12
Nobody gives a fuck about decentralization. One exchange offering a new currency to trade causing the price of bitcoin to drop 25% shows it’s neither as decentralized nor as resilient as people claim. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:01
No it doesn’t. We’d double the capacity on the network which is exactly what bitcoin needs. You force segwit adoption and double the block size with a hard fork. This isn’t meant to be a permanent solution, bitcoin still needs something like lightning network but in the mean time increase the block size and force segwit 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:27
If it reversed and the price went from $18 to $20 I'd be incredibly happy right now. I took a big gamble and I lost big. It fucking sucks but it's not even close to the end of the world. Tax refund season isn't that far away anyways that I can try to cover my losses. 
Thank you, I hope I recover too and believe me as soon as I do, I'm out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:15
Also the day it shot up 400% lol. Cryptos are Ponzi schemes and most people just want to make a quick buck. Look at bcash for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:48:52
How much you lose?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:25:32
There’s nothing corrupt about an exchange offering a new currency. You’re just butthurt over the price of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:48:52
Crypto not security on an ico is 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:08:54
Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:23
And falling. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:01:39
Hell yes 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:33
There’s about 2.5 transactions per second being processed on the blockchain that means a shit ton of miners have gotten off the network. Bitcoin is dead 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:59:53
No the thing that ruined aol was broadband lol 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:07:20
Gee and it fucking works. My oh my...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:08:30
Nothing but hope
Why would I sell and lose money? Ever since it crashed its been hovering at $15k. Even after this crash today its back up to $15k. I've got faith bitcoin will rise above $15k
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:43:33
Is one start with a 3? Bitcoin hard fork just went into effect so now everybody has a legacy wallet and a segwit wallet 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:28:17
Can’t do that with stock either yet financial institutions have embraced stocks.
