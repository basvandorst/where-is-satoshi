Well. He does raise a valid point: what constitutes a new user? If it's complete accounts he has no base. If it's just surrendering an email and then dropping off, you have to factor in a bounce rate and for every 100k it's probably closer to 10k. That's just using industry averages though.

My problem with bitsquare is that there are 500 payment options and no one uses mine, period. 
One nice thing about the exchanges is that it can keep it out of the mining blocks if you are trading between two exchange accounts. Could you imagine how screwed the blocks would be if they had to mine every transaction on the exchanges?

I've never had his problem. Just looked and it was 12.50 for one of my $5000 purchases. 9 out of 10 I pay no fee as I use the maker strategy. Weird. I also am hesitant to believe you because the order once filled leaves this tab and goes to the filled tab. I want to call BS on this one. 
Also. If you really did receive twice the bitcoin for half the price some how you wouldn't be complaining about the fee. So much wrong with this. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:35:21
Pretty much this. If you are a "maker" you can pay zero fees. What's a maker? Just make sure you are the provider of the transaction. Set a limit to buy below the mid market price and limit orders to sell above the mid market price and you can pay zero.

Any hashing algorithm can collide, it's a matter of time and compute power. Turning an input into a finite length output will eventually yield 2 inputs that yield the same output. "dude". I mean, your statement is sort of paradoxical. It isn't that it is possible, only that you can?

What do you mean by auto buy and sell? Limits will live until you cancel them, at a price you specify, but they are not event driven. Some sort of script? They do have an API you can leverage. GDAX is the exchange Coinbase is built on (same company) and it doesn't span Polonex or Kraken, just like Kraken and Polonex don't span each other or GDAX. Exchanges are discrete entities. 
If you want a platform that isn't an exchange per se but trades across whatever platform I'm unaware of such a tool. With the clearing times to send bitcoin to these exchanges it may present a bit of difficulty even if you did pass their verification for each exchange. The limits per exchange also vary. I'm a coder who likes a challenge, but aside from scalping the arbitrage this doesn't seem practical.

So some one learned a term and thought he would share. Cute. The risk is priced to where the market will bear. No one is willing to push the ATH. Simple as that.

What I think he means is that it will be slow to saturation. You could replace long hauls and get to 30-40% saturation in about 20 years. Keep in mind, the average age of vehicles (including transport) is 15 years and it takes time to replace hundreds of millions of vehicles through manufacturing... And people constantly upgrade who aren't in that 15 year bucket. But it'll take a huge societal change to get this to work in dense urban areas like New York. So you'll have the manual "last mile" legs. I'm a fan of self driving cars in most scenarios, but I'd still like to opt to drive when I want to. I'm sure I'll miss it time. So, like bitcoin itself, saturation will decrease as it approaches 100%.

In this case that is an apple to oranges comparison. 
It had a first mover advantage, sure, but it's exactly why you have fairly close price parity between all the exchanges right now. Adding exchanges doesn't add coins.
*In this case* it's not the supply of exchanges, it is the supply of the underlying traded asset: The bitcoin people are willing to buy and sell. 
If you had 10k coins moved a day, simply put one exchange could handle it. 2 would do 5k each, and 4 2.5k each. If they all went evenly. This doesn't really change the price of bitcoin, but you may get a bit of disparity between them, but never more than the cost of the fees because you could make money on the difference between two exchanges. 
edit: there are politics in play that create risk for transferring between exchanges. In a perfect world, you'd trade to Huboi right now and make $50 a coin - fees profit. However, due to what's going on right now that risk is too wild.

I've worked for public companies before. We are barred from purchasing stock on the open market, but we are allowed to buy an unlimited amount through time controls. You can say I want to buy 5k at whatever price in 6 months and it will execute on that day for whatever that translates to. Or you could buy stock on the 3 month daily average price if your company was matching a contribution. It was always as easy as opening etrade. Except you were expected not to. And no one would ever check. Unless you have them reason to. It's an honors system. 
If you think the company is up in 12 months on that new product you are working on, this is your way to trade on that knowledge. 
This is how executives are forced to sell their stock. That's why you see this planned out 6 to 12 or even more in advance. 
Although bitcoin is relatively new, just look at the high profile executions that lawmakers have been looking to make in the community. It may not be worth the crosshairs. 
Insider trading on stocks for companies you don't work at is nearly impossible to prove. Just look at how any have been jailed for it since 2000. You can count them on one hand.

Sure. Or just don't make a program that won't open twice. Because it was a zero balance wallet I had zero incentive to open it and it errors and refuses to recover from said error every time I open it now. 
Follow my logic: I don't want a program where I have to recover my wallet every time I can't shut down the program cleanly. Period. Balance or not. Only an asshole says that is my fault. Because I did have a password, the phrases, and the dat file backed up. Zero incentive to use shit software.

This isn't exactly a "break" imo. It's a flaw in hashing as a concept entirely. Two different strings can produce the same hash, so given enough compute power this will happen for every hashing algorithm in time. You just continue to migrate higher doesn't mean it wouldn't succumb to the same issue in time. 
Edit: basically agreeing with you. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:43:18
Just look at the volume and candles. It all points to accumulation and new capital inflows. Due to the lack of actual liquidity it has good upward pressure. Combined with the 24/7 hours, 1 week gets the same love 1 month does on the usual markets. With limited "float" and "hodlers" recognizing the potential market bitcoin has they've assigned a forward valuation in excess of the current price. So it'll continue to steadily rise. 
plus, for all the noise around the blockchain and hate for exchanges like Coinbase, people fail to recognize that 99% of the general public who gets involved in Bitcoin will be using these exchanges. Essentially functioning as side chains , banks, and investment vehicles.

Ok, not even sure how that ties into what I wrote. How many of those vehicles do we produce a year? A quick google, cause you know.. I substantiate my numbers.
How many trucks are sold in the U.S.?
Approximate average of 192,000 per year
How many trucks operate in the U.S.? 
Estimates of 15.5 million trucks operate in the U.S.. Of this figure 2 million are tractor trailers.
Numbers, numbers, numbers... suddenly self driving cars poof! Woah, simple maff tells em 15,500,000 / 192,000 gives me 80! There are too many trucks on the road and not enough production to make them all self driving that quickly. Sure we'll ramp up production. But any &lt; 20 year timeline for 100% replacement is insane.

Since it is backed by bitcoin they'll choose something like 1 share = .25 or .1 or .01 bitcoin. So from there the price should be that multiple of the current strike on (likely) Gemini. Then they'll charge maintenance fees and it'll change these values.. They'll probably make it approachable though. Maybe $10 -&gt; $100 per share, the lower end being more likely so more people can buy in.

Interesting thought is that if the price *does* recover. Say over the course of that 1 month. Once the exchanges re-open, if they wanted to get to where they were before they dumped, that's a whole lot of accumulated coins on the other exchanges now. If this stays where it is, between China and the ETF, March is looking pretty good.

You've got the right idea but rarely does it correlate to a price movement. It does however give you an idea of the real time support and resistance. Instead of it indicating up or down, it's more like how *easily* it will go up or down. Take a look at how we got to 1290. 400 after 400 volume candles. Literally 40 coins dropped it 10 dollars. Then the panic set in and just 20 coins dropped it from 1960 to 1950. 
Basically, if it gets to that point sellers are trapped and if you're a buyer it indicates wait for the drop. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:44:53

Approval? Miss out on maybe 10% as I hit that market buy order. Buy now? Stuck holding with money tied up for X time. Disapproval? Buy the dip. 
Trading 10% upside for risk mitigation was worth imo. Just not as strong willed as some hodlers :)
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:17:50
Look at how commodity backed ETFs actually work before shitposting. Let's use the example of gold or silver ETFs. Let's say they've got 10 shares to 1 oz of gold, making each share ~$120 (ticker:$GLD) (simple example). If gold goes up, the ETF goes up. If more people buy than they have reserves, they must purchase reserves. This is where futures and unallocated reserves come into play. Because, unlike Bitcoin, these assets are hard to move they mostly trade between ETFs, Banks, and Vaults as IOUs in order to avoid moving them.
Same thing still applies to Bitcoin though. They have to buy and sell based on the number of LONG shares, not the number of short sellers. The ETF will never trade at a huge premium +/- to the underlying commodity, however, no matter how many long/shorts exist due in part because of the underlying asset.
edit: to be clear, there is no "unlimited" printing. There is no "share" per se. If you buy in, they buy bitcoin. It's that simple. So you influence the price (of bitcoin) if you buy, but not if you short (of bitcoin) because that doesn't count towards the float that determines their holdings. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:43:13
Or, the thousands and thousands of people who bought before the highs want to secure gains ahead of the inevitable drop. I got out last week and it's exactly why it couldn't break $1300. Too many people on the sidelines. 300 coins dropped it $75 and just 40 raised it $75. There is zero liquidity to support the amount of people wanting to exit all at once. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:42:40
No, AWS only provides general compute. Basically just much more expensive hardware than your laptop or desktop.
The stuff running bitcoin is exponentially more tuned to the job. So the cost to beat it may be exponentially higher, say at least $500M in general compute power (maybe even way more) to get to the ~$300M in purpose built equipment who's one job is to mine Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:00:58
Yeah. I'm actually jabbing you for your other trash posts where *you* don't get open market ETFs lol. 
Shorting will allow people to make money (or lose it) on the ETF but it won't touch the price of bitcoin. That's not how ETFs work. 
Going long will affect the price of bitcoin positively over time as they rebalance their underlying assets which is done every so often. 
And selling (not shorting) will lower the price provided the ETF has to shed assets. Because they have to sell the bitcoin. 
There's no way to really manipulate the price of BTC any more than had you just bought bitcoin itself. It's hilarious you continue to keep posting FUD. 
Like I can short GLD but it doesn't influence the price of gold. Just lol.

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:55:31
I am basing this analysis on the GDAX order book. 
10 coins makes $5 USD, so if you're like me and you drop 30,40,50 at a time (or buy) you're moving the price. One person can drop this $100 at any moment. 
Liquidity means the number of coins available at any price point. Simply put, there are none. 
edit: 100 coins drops it to 1166, now of course this changes multiple times per second, but like 6:30am if some one drops 1000 coins instead, we are going down. 
edit2: yes, sorry USD in this case.

what makes a bad second layer? Because Coinbase doesn't comply with either the utopian tenant of distributed anonymity? One could argue the only reason the price is so high is *because* of the exchanges. General adoption requires familiarity and for the general populace this is it. I guarantee you without the exchanges the scaling debate would have sunk the price. Having a hardware wallet is not practical for *many* people. If anyone I want to send money to has a Coinbase account it is instant and fee free because it's off chain. 
No. Exchanges / banks are going to be a thing. It'll just be in bitcoin. This is great for bitcoin. Sure there will be problems. There are always problems. But people will work around them. Because that is what people do. 
As it stands. Second layers are scaling bitcoin better than any technology due in part simply because the technology isn't being adopted.

That 11k+ deposits into bank accounts are subject to capital gains.

oh, Coinbase. Yeah sure. GDAX not so much. This thread sort of deviated from the OP of stop loss, which you can not do on Coinbase so I assumed that is what we were talking about :P

Same. It's why I sold and had my full position + more at 950 which was indeed hit. Now I'm sitting on about 25% more than I had. Woulda been more since I intended to drop more $ from Coinbase ACH but it was down XD we all know it's a shitty system but it's how I buy before I xfer

No. Just unlucky they built on top of the largest web provider around and the specific region went down. 
This affected hundreds of thousands of companies. Obviously some bigger than others.

This happens several times a day if you watch close enough. Sometimes a jerk does a mirror to show off. He will do 700 at a buy and 700 at a sell and they move up and down with each other and vanish at the same time. Scripting and money.

Yes, but lower fees. Much lower. Forgot if it's .5% or not. Coinbase is 1% each way using ACH as your buy mechanism. 
There is almost zero liquidity right now at your given price. It's why the price is sort of fuzzy. Looking at GDAX, what underpins Coinbase, if I were to buy just five bitcoins at almost any point in the day I'd move the price $5. It's got massive resistance above 1290 and just 40 coins is dropping it $15 at times. It quickly recovers since, again, sometimes less than 50 coins trade hands in an entire 5m candle. 
This is why. 
GDAX can be zero fees each way. I recommend it.

Scripts man. If you dropped 500 coins into that you'd hit air since it'd cancel faster than your sell.

Add your bank account to get it to 3,000 ( you don't need to use it, just add it )

For every share you buy, they have to buy that much bitcoin. It'll work exactly like a silver backed ETF which opens things up to things like futures or unallocated supply. 
But basically, if you buy 10 btc worth of the ETF, they need to go out and purchase that same 10btc. If you sell 10btc they need to shed 10btc. This is a simple example. In a perfect world theres multiple people buying and selling and they only need to reallocate during big moves.
I'd say yeah, if you believe in bitcoin. The ETF is just a layman's tool.

It's an honors system that has a low chance to bite you if you're audited since they'll go through your bank statements and ask you to explain your funds. 
Easiest way to dodge capital gains is to simple transfer to another exchange before selling then neither exchange knows your cost basis. 
Until you're audited. Just don't go throwing millions around gangster style.

Some people believe they can flip it quickly, always holding out for that higher high and disbelieving when it drops and then sell in panic. I did this for a couple trades on the stock market, so I am guilty of it. However, I've been in bitcoin for 4 years just slowly adding. My friend got me into it at $30. Only regret now is I didn't buy more. I just bought two more at 930 tho :D

Levels of verification. I'm up to 20k a week on Coinbase and 1k/day on Gemini by providing yet more information to them like occupation and earning potential. Duration of account life, account activity (using your entire potential gets you more after 21 days of waiting. Do it again? More after 21 days. ). 
It's a myriad of things. What I wouldn't do it pay with a CC like OP. they charge something like 3.5% (the base cc fee plus their fee). 
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:17:47
Well, with a little programming you could always charge yourself with something like stripe.js and just eat the transaction fee. 
Or, send it between two paypal accounts? For a slightly higher fee than the above option. Unless it's a specific vendor gift card, if it can be charged as a visa the above two options should work.

I have a Chase checking, savings, and business account. They won't let me wire from any of them, so I just use the slow ACH transfer and accumulate slowly :(. I've been around Coinbase long enough to get my ACH limit to a comfortable level for what I spend on Bitcoin, clearly not OP trying to move 6 figures.

Wouldn't they be getting their red envelopes days in advance? The wife and I have it a couple weeks ahead since, if left to the last minute, it never gets done. Either way, I also don't touch my btc for it.

Sites mostly unusable. Use search bar, click into listing, click back - no list. Click back again, back on reddit. Click 2nd page, click back or page 1.. same issue. Search field cleared.
Very poorly coded unfortunately.

They probably don't get bitcoin, but USD, through the processor. So they couldn't refund BTC. They'd give you credit likely.

I just did this yesterday after learning TD Bank shut down their version. $134 in change over the course of the last year. I would have gladly taken Bitcoin, instead opting for that 10.9% cut :(. 
However, they'd probably still charge that 10.9% because they are likely getting some fee from the gift card provider. Either way an option I'd pick for sure. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:24:30
They accepted a bank statement from me. Try that?
