ASICs have an inherent advantage over desktops, but it can be minimized by using an instantly verifiable memory-bound PoW (using hundreds of MB) that makes DRAM latency the bottleneck.
Instead of your block-height mod 3 selection, I find a myriad-coin approach preferable. Every 2016 blocks, adjust the difficulty for (existing) cpu-bound PoW and memory-bound PoW, reducing cpu-bound fraction of rewards from current 100% to 50% over the course of a few years.
The ultimate goal should be for the memory-bound PoW attracting so many miners (using their phone while charging overnight or their webassembly enabled browser), solo-mining lottery style, that this PoW remains forever unprofitable.

DRAM chips are already optimized for reading and writing billions of bits at random, which is precisely what a PoW like  spends most of its time doing.
Also note the stated goal of being unprofitable for everyone, including the hypothetical ASIC developer, beause too many people are happy to mine at a loss if it only takes one click to get started, and the efficiency gap between custom and commodity hardware is known to be within an order of magnitude.

It's obvious that a PoW cannot be made ASIC "proof". The goal is to limit the gap in performance per watt (possibly adjusted for development and production costs).
If that gap can be limited to an order of magnitude, and the barrier to mining can be significantly lowered (wallet based desktop mining, webassembly based browser mining, overnight charging based smartphone mining). then there is some hope of making enough people wiling to mine at a loss (some as a lottery substitute, other sas part of a botnet) to make industrial mining entirely unprofitable.
That would bring true decentralization.
A memory bound PoW for which DRAM latency is the bottleneck would be ideal for that, since commodity hardware is pretty well optimized for making the best use of memory.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:09:54
Compute-bound PoWs are ASIC-friendly by nature.
Memory-bound PoWs that need more memory than fits on a single chip, lead to simple ASICs that must be connected to (much more expensive) memory modules; whose throughput is limited by the memory interface and latency.
Such a setup has limited performance &amp; power advantage over commodity hardware.

@_date: 2014-02-09 19:17:05


Not necessarily. It’s a consequence of making the proof of work computationally intensive. If computation is minimized in favor of random access to gigabytes of memory (incurring long latencies), then mining will require investments in RAM but relatively little power.
A proof-of-work system like Cuckoo Cycle
1) performs only one very cheap hash computation for several random accesses to memory
2) has memory requirements that can be set arbitrarily and doesn't allow for any time-memory trade-off.
3) has trivially verifiable proofs
As a result, runtime is completely dominated (95%) by memory latency. It promotes the use of commodity general-purpose hardware over custom designed single-purpose hardware, making mining more sustainable.

The 18x can be reduced to 12x. It looks like a bad tradeoff for only 4x speedup, but GPUs cannot take advantage of the memory reduction to run 12x more instances since one instance will already
keep all memory banks busy and additional instances will just slow things down more. I expect GPUs will be an order of magnitude faster running the bandwidth bound solver. They will also be using more power, but probably not a whole order of magnitude. These things will all need to be quantified in the coming months...

The PoW is called Cuckoo Cycle and not cuckoo hash (it's not a hash function). Note that the project page you link to states that since early April this year, a new bandwidth-bound solver by xenoncat manages to outperform the latency-bound solver by about 4x (while using about 18x more memory).

We can directly compare the Cuckoo Cycle edge trimming throughput of a single DRAM chip for the latency vs bandwidth bound solvers.
I believe such a chip typically has 8 independently operating memory banks, each of which has a 50ns latency for switching rows on a new random access. That limits its latency throughput to 8 edges/50ns = 160Me/s (million edges per second). For bandwidth the number of banks is irrelevant, as the chip interface is limited to typically 64-bit transfers at 800Mhz, for a bandwidth throughput of (64/80)*800Me/s = 640Me/s (in each phase, each edge causes a 5 byte read and a 5 byte write, for 80 bits total). Now it's possible that my understanding of DRAMs, or these numbers are way off, but this factor of 4x happens to match the observed performance difference for CPUs.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:37:51

If you have multiple cores, then you can choose between running one multi-threaded instance, or multiple single-threaded instances. The latter uses more memory but avoids the need for thread synchronization and thus tends to be a little faster.
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:01:13
Indeed, the latency miner only accesses a 2-bit counter per edge.
During count_node_deg(), node_deg() calls nonleaf-&gt;set(u &gt;&gt;= PART_BITS) to increase u's 2-bit counter.
During kill_leaf_edges(), kill() calls nonleaf-&gt;test(u &gt;&gt; PART_BITS)) to test u's counter. While all your observations on bit widths and buses are correct, I don't see how they affect my analysis of the "edge throughput" of a single DRAM chip in the two solving approaches. Latency could be somewhat less than 50ns, but not enough to turn the tables?!

It is clearly not the same. It just happens to specialize to the plain birthday collision of Momentum for the choice of k = 1.
Just like my Cuckoo Cycle specializes to plain birthday collisions for the choice of cycle length = 2.
So what's interesting here is that we have two rather different ways of generalizing Momentum, both of which (appear to) remedy its lack of memory hardness.
Btw, it's curious that the name "Momentum" describes a property that is very detrimental for a PoW, which really ought to be so-called progress-free. The latter was then achieved by limiting the number of nonces to 2^26, rendering the name quite non-descriptive.

And thus memory hardness can only be achieved by going beyond
the hashcash proof of work, as I wrote about in
The desirability of a memory hard PoW for a high market cap crypto currency is an open question with no easy answers and one that deserves more study.
I think it could be desirable if it can radically change the economics of mining,
to the point where mining is profitable for no one. That means that even the
(hypothetically) most energy-efficient ASIC with custom memory technology,
would still not have a positive ROI, due to the following reasons:
(1) fabrication costs are going to be much larger than for whatever memory technology is used for commodity computing devices, which still enjoy much larger economies of scale.
(2) electricity costs, while lower than for commodity memory, are unlikely to
to be more than an order of magnitude lower.
and the main reason:
(3) huge numbers of people could be willing to mine at a loss, just as they are happy to play the lottery. this requires a very low barrier to entry, like one click
to install a mining app on your phone that will make it mine overnight while charging.
it helps to know that your mining efficiency is not more than (roughly) an order of magnitude worse than with custom hardware.
Of course I'm not claiming this is a likely scenario, but I think it's at least imaginable...
Another possibility to consider is having 2 PoWs: one compute bound, and one memory bound, splitting the blocks between them. Mining the compute bound one would be (barely) profitable with ASICs, while the mining the memory bound one would be unprofitable, but help decentralization.
Still, unprofitable mining is by no means a requirement for making memory hard PoWs desirable.
It is conceivable that any memory technology developed to make the PoW's memory accesses as energy efficient as possible, 
will benefit many other classes of computation especially in mobile, solar powered, and other low-powered settings, as thus inevitably lead to commoditization.
This argument works best for PoWs that do as little
computation as possible apart from memory accesses,
and I believe this is where Cuckoo Cycle's edge trimming shines.
