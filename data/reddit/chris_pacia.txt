I wouldn't expect a mobile app for a while, but I would say we do have our eye on being able to run a full p2p openbazaar node in the browser. 
It might not support seller functions but it should be able to browse the network and buy things. That would port fairly well to mobile as well.

Including paths where the correct value is at each hop? That is my whole point. It seems unlikely to be easy even if you know the state of the entire network. If the value isn't there then it isn't there. There's nothing you can do problematically or at a protocol level to make people have the right amount bitcoins in the right channel at the right time. 
If you know of any research or simulation please share. Because I'm under the impression they are just going with a gut feeling that people will have the right amount of btc in the right channels and the right time.

I don't think finding routing *paths* with be that difficult. The paper by bitfury was fairly good (although it adds much complexity to an already complex protocol). 
But the problem isn't that you need to find routing *paths* but paths where each hop along the way has the correct value. 
As far as I know nobody has done any simulations to see if that is even likely. If I was to buy something for $200 what's the likelihood of finding a 5 or 6 hop paths with each hop having $200 on the outgoing side of the channel? I don't think anyone has a clue and they are just crossing their fingers and hoping it works. Which seems like a very bad way of designing a protocol and allocating scarce development resources.

Transaction must never fail to find a route else the transaction will not be able to be made (you won't get close to visa scale if people have to default waiting for a confirmation and pay a high fee to transact). I would argue a payment system that fails to send funds some % of the time will be a failure as a consumer product.
Sadly we don't know what percentage of LN txs will fail to find routes because they don't even know how routing is going to work yet, let alone have practical experience with it in the real world. The last year of work has been purely speculative and has a non zero probability of being a catastrophic failure.

This is one of the many problems with the federal reserve. It used to be the case that Americans could just simply save cash and it would appreciate by 3-6% per year. 
After the Fed came along, only an idiot would save cash as you would lose 3-6% per year. So it forces people to go out and invest in risky(er) assets and purchase services from stock brokers just to get a positive return on their retirement savings. 
It creates a natural demand for those services, which when couple with massive government restrictions on who can sell such services, creates massive profits for Wall St. 
Then the very people who support these policies campaign around the country criticizing income inequality.

Because the aggregate price level adjusts to the level of supply and demand. If the savings rate was 90% it wouldn't matter as long as prices clear. People do have [time preference]( which means spending on consumer goods will never be zero.

The underlying concept is still the same ... users host their own stores and others use the client to visit them.

Well LTCs whole roadmap is to just merge in commits from Core. Which means it will run into the same problems with fees etc. If you want to scale you need optimize the shit out of everything, which the BCH developers seem committed to doing. 
As for LN. I don't particularly have high hopes. Maybe I'll be surprised, but even if it works as expected (which seems like a long shot) I just can't see $40-$100 fees to open channels producing a viable consumer app. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:10:25


Fwiw in OpenBazaar we used the native P2WSH for multisig because our own nodes understand that. But it does make it difficult for people to send funds to to these address from outside the wallet. So what they end up doing is sending funds into the native wallet and paying from there... which costs an extra fee.
We also haven't yet implemented segwit for P2PKH addresses because I'd prefer to use P2WPKH but again, nobody else support paying to such address types. And there's no way I would implement the nested P2SH segwit addresses because it's such an invasive refactor for my code and it's not as efficient as P2WPKH and I'd have to do another invasive refactor just to switch back. It also blows up restoring coins from a seed.
But all this is moot now as fees have basically destroyed the OB use case for Bitcoin and we've had to switch to BCH. I suspect BTC will probably be deprecated if the fees remain where they are and all my BTC and segwit work would have gone to waste. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:48:04


Well most computers have more than 10x available resources. With some software optimizations, the laptop I'm typing this on can likely handle 100mb blocks. And we know of more optimizations beyond that which can still be implemented. I suspect by the time that capacity is exhausted (which I expect to be years from now) more advanced scaling techniques, like sharding will be maturing. 


That's true, but as you said it requires LN to work as expected. I'm not convinced it will. But you'll also have the same problem you currently have with segwit where people are very slow to adopt it. If you think they're slow to adopt segwit just wait until they have to implement something that is 1000x more complex. And of course it's not clear that 1mb would ever be enough to have reasonable channel opening and closing fees even if everyone used LN.


BCH is lightning compatible. You just can't use dual-funded channels but it's not even clear that dual funded channels would be common anyway. In the event they are needed you could just open a second channel. The capacity will be there to do so.

I don't see why that is important. To the extent that nodes matter at all it's because by having *some* economic actors full validate their transactions it discourages miners from trying to cartelize and change the consensus rules. But you don't need everyone, or even people in a giving geographical area, to run nodes to get that effect. 
People in the third world can just use SPV. Which to the extent they use Bitcoin at all they are surely already doing (or maybe just a trusted API). I seriously doubt anyone in the third world is running a full node today and bitcoin isn't harmed because of it.
As to malleability I believe third party malleability was fixed with the last hardforks. But even if I'm wrong, the need for monitoring is one of the uglier aspects of LN and another one of the reasons why I think LN will be hard pressed to see any substantial consumer adoption.

I don't know what to say except that you are wrong. If I send your non-upgraded node a tx that has a parent in it's history that spends an invalid CLTV transaction, your node wont know to reject it. All you can do is wait to see if it gets confirmed. That is exactly bitcoinj-style SPV.
Note that I don't have a problem with bitcoinj, but if people wanted an SPV node they would have just run bitcoinj. The reason they run a full node is because they want a fully validating node! And the softfork gives them SPV.


The old ruleset is *invalid*. That's what you are failing to comprehend. If in the extremely low probability your non-upgraded node got attacked**, the coins you received would be unspendable because they are on a minority fork. You could complain "but my node fully validated the old rules!" and that complaint would fall on def ears because people will only accept coins on the majority chain. 
**Note the only difference between an attack on a non-upgraded node and a SPV node would be the attacker would need to have had possession of the coins he first sends to you. But tricking your node into accepting them would require the same amount of hashing power in both cases. 
Now that I think of it, I would argue non-upgraded nodes are worse than SPV because at least with SPV everybody knows not to accept very large payments. With a non-upgraded node, they think they are safe to accept large payments where they wouldn't have if they knew they were SPV.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:38:02


I've heard this line a million times and each time I point out that double spends do not need to be prevented for zeroconf to be useful, they only need to be detected in a timely manner to prevent fraud. That largely has been possible when miners were using first seen. It isn't possible with full rbf. 
And up to this point it has worked reasonably well and the fraud rate has been very low. Note that it doesn't need to be zero to make business sense.
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:46:51
Opt-in was always a very transparent farse. None of the devs pushing it wanted it to be opt-in, they just received tremendous backlash when trying to ram through the non-opt-in version. 
But they knew all along that once blocks become full the only way to transact will be to "opt-in" to it. Otherwise your txs will get stuck. So it was a rather clever back door around public opinion. 
And also, I used cup of coffee as an example. You can substitute any other retail item if you like (a $250 microwave for example). The fact is you can't create channels on the fly and the only guarantee you will be able to pay the merchant is to use a well connected (likely very large) payment hub. 
I think those who are saying there won't be payment hubs and it will all be wallet-to-wallet are engaging in wishful thinking.

The way you censor an OpenBazaar node is the same way you would censor a Bitcoin node... DoS attacks, Sybil attacks, taking over your internet connection, etc.
If you can't reach the Bitcoin network to either put data in or get data out of the blockchain then how can you claim it's censorship resistant?
If you say, well people can use Tor to try to circumvent most of that... Well so can people running an OpenBazaar node.

So every time you visit a store front and download images, listings, profiles, etc you will become a seeder of that data. "Followers" would likely cache everything. 
Sellers should be able to go offline and have their data persist. It wont be the same as having every node store everything, but this will be much more scalable.

Yeah with the existing code. It could be upgraded to give the user the option: "in the event of fork, follow the longest (unvalidated) chain of blocks". Which is more or less what non-upgraded full nodes do with a softfork. The difference is this is opt-in. Plus you get the benefits of having a cleaner, more efficient protocol. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:55:45
I agree that the equation:


is misleading outright but even more so when you consider what is driving bigger blocks... adoption. With adoption you also have a phenomenon that looks like this...


The question is which effect outweighs the other? Right now most merchants use a payment processor so increased adoption isn't likely to drive much of an increase in full nodes. But will it always be like that?
If merchants start using Bitcoin outright, without a payment processor, surely we would see the number of nodes go up with adoption. 
Again we can debate which effect is the primary driver of node count, but it should be clear the first equation is far too simplistic.

@_date: 2015-12-15 16:47:01
I don't want to get into a discussion about zeroconf, but needless to say I disagree. 
I'm in complete agreement that the network cannot scale to handle visa like traffic.... today. In theory, if bandwidth, cpu, storage, etc grow faster than transaction volume it could in the future. So that is another way bitcoin could scale. This is my preferred solution btw, but it depends on a variable that is largely out of our control. 
You guys seems to assume we're going to hit visa level traffic in the near future. Of course, the network can't handle it, but that also isn't realistic. I'm skeptical that the network wont be able to handle levels of volume that we can realistically expect. 
 
But if volume increases faster than the technology (and optimizations) can keep up with it, then obviously other solutions are needed. 


If you read above you'll realized you've mischaracterized my position. 


This might be a fundamental difference in economic views. The demand for gold, imo, comes from two things. 1) It's use in industry. 2) People speculating that in the event of a global economic meltdown, it might play a larger role in barter, central bank reserves, etc. 
In other words, if not for (2), the price of gold would not exceed it's use value (1). 
Unlike gold, bitcoin has no industrial use value. It's value is derived almost exclusively from people speculating that, in the future, it will be demanded in exchange. Which essentially means bitcoin has to be exchanged for goods and services (at some point) for it to keep any value at all. We can't just sit on it and expect it's value to grow. 
I also own bitcoin, so just like you, I want to protect my investment. Which is why I want to see it traded as much as possible. Bitcoin cannot stand as an investment asset alone. It will have no value if that's the case.

Neither does it remove a torrent that is seeded by hundreds of users, so what's the point? You aren't using the blockchain for anything other than data storage, which is an abuse of the bitcoin protocol and a waste of everyone's resources. And at the end of the say, what do you get for abusing the protocol and requiring users to download 50 gigabytes of data? ... data is (maybe) replicated on more node's than openbazaar store data will be. 
I say maybe, but the number of seeders of an openbazaar store could (in theory) exceed the number of bitcoin nodes. The difference is nobody downloads 50 gigabytes of data they don't need and it isn't forcing bitcoin nodes to store data unrelated to consensus.

One of the first use cases for bitcoin was to send money to wikileaks because no one would give them a bank account. If it costs an arm and a leg to run a lightning hub and the regulatory environment is similar then it's likely wikileaks wont get an account.

The fork is largely going to be up to miners. Some very high threshold of miners will need to upgrade to XT before it triggers an increase in block size. If that threshold isn't met then there is no fork.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:09:42
Well it wouldn't require a hardfork, just a flag to set at startup. 


And I agree it's kind of dumb, but that's what happens to non-upgraded nodes during a softfork. But with a softfork, they don't consent to the security reduction. They think they have a fully validating node, but it turns out they don't because the devs pushed a softfork they didn't know of. 
At least with what I'm describing above, the user can 'opt-in' to the reduced security if they don't upgrade and aren't forced into it and the network doesn't split if these users fail to upgrade. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 03:34:03
Seems like doing it as a hard fork would be the correct way to go rather than bastardizing it with a soft fork.

The notion seems to imply that if we just keep the block size at 1 mb indefinitely that we can at least preserve the value of our coins. But our coins only have value because people are speculating on high future demand from people using it. If the block size stays stuck and 1 mb (and LN doesn't work as well as expected) that demand simply cannot materialize and will certainly cause the price to crash.

Another concern of mine is by making on chain transactions expensive, even basic uses of smart contracts ... like 2 of 3 escrow, could become too expensive to use. 
Smart contracts are really a core feature of blockchain tech and it could be deprecated for almost all use cases, with the exception of those which still make business sense after paying high fees.

I would like the protocol to be separate from the implementations. Ideally the various implementations could make decisions without protracted logrolling, but the process for amending the protocol should be much more difficult and require input from many people in the various sectors across the bitcoin economy. 
Right now the process to amend the protocol is just ― get a PR merged into Core ― which is unacceptable imo. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:51:07
He's saying that a hardfork should never happen because it's bad ux to have to push an update to wallet users before they can use the wallet.
Personally, that is a very weak complaint imo. Every mobile user is used to apps updating themselves. The bitcoin wallet on my phone has updated over 100 times and 99% of them I didn't even notice. 
If we adopt the policy that major upgrades to the protocol can never be done as a hard fork because people will have to upgrade their wallets, then you end up having to do one ugly hack after another to make changes. Which will ultimately hurt you down the road.

Serious question. Do you see any possible way the LN will have more payment hubs than we currently have nodes (or even more hubs than nodes at a large block size)?
If you're worried that $50/month to run a node will cause a dangerous degree of centralization than what does that say about payment hubs that will likely cost $100k to $1M a month to run?
There's this assumption going around that LN will be more decentralized at scale than the bitcoin network. But that's an unproven assumption (and one that there's good reason to be skeptical about). 


It isn't even about the money. For me it's about undermining the power of central banks (and governments by extension). Bitcoin is no threat to existing political regimes if only 50k people use it or if it's nothing more than a black market currency that never sees more than $1M in trade. 
To realize it's potential for disruptive political change we need as many people using it as possible.

I go into a store and buy something. Because I'm an asshole as soon as I walk out the store, I pull out my phone and press a "double spend" button to steal back my coins from the merchant.
The merchant's client sees my attempt to steal from him and broadcasts another tx with a slightly higher fee taking the coins back from me. 
My phone sees this and broadcasts yet another transaction with an even higher fee.
This process repeats over and over until the entire value of the transaction is burned in tx fees. I essentially paid the miner for the goods, while the merchant is left with nothing. 
The only way to make that work would be to require the buyer pays more for the product than it costs, then refund the difference after confirmation. In that scenario the buyer would end up overpaying for the item if he got into a scorched earth fee war. 
I can't image bitcoin ever going mainstream if we have to explain that to both users and merchants and when they look at us perplexed we just say, "look that's just how bitcoin works".

You absolutely need permission from a third party to use lightening. The hub needs to deposit it's own money into the channel you create with it. If no payment hubs wish to put their money your channel, you can't use lightening.
Maybe the fact that anyone can create their own payment hub will make that less likely, but then again anyone can create a bank and yet there are plenty of people who can't get a bank account. Lightning ends up looking much more like banking than Bitcoin in it's current state.

That's putting words in my mouth to say the least. Look I like the concept of the lightning network. I think Joseph and Thad are very smart and I like them personally. It's something that should definitely be built and I'm all for making changes to bitcoin to get the most efficient form, SW &amp; CSV. I'm sure, at minimum, it will find use cases around the bitcoin economy. 
What I'm not for is prematurely deprecating core features of bitcoin, that have stood from it's inception to today, when we have not seen how the lightning network will work in practice. 
Will organic decentralized routing be feasible, or will there be pressure to use large centralized payment hubs? This isn't some crazy far fetched concern, it was basically the topic of Joseph's talk at scaling bitcoin which he admits would be pretty bad if it looks like that in practice.

The 'problems' he talks about are things like channels expiring before the recipient releases the value. The 'solutions' are technical fixes to those technical problems.
The only 'fix' for the 'bob has to be really rich' problem is to distribute to capital cost onto multiple hubs. But given that the capital costs are so astronomical, even hubs that have only a few users will still need orders of magnitude of capital than people running a bitcoin node. 
I still don't think you grasp the issue of why hubs need capital.

I think you might be overestimating the degree to which businesses will not be able to afford to run a node.
Remember an electrum server is different and more costly than running a node. And it has a built in business model to cover their costs.. They are servers afterall. They can bill clients that rely on them. The fact that none do is just because the operators want to provide the service for free. That's their choice, but they could definitely cover their costs if they wanted to.


Describes my laptop. I wouldn't be running a node on my laptop at 20 or 30 gbs, of course. But I could on a reasonably priced vps. 
Enterprise servers would only be needed if tx volume blew up to visa level overnight. In reality if that happens it will likely be far in the future when everything will be much cheaper.

I'm happy for you that you have a bachelors degree. You're almost there.
As for the paper. That is the primary source of the claim that "97%" believe that man is the primary cause of global warming. 
Yet, by Cook's own research, he only gets to the 97% number by lumping in everyone who believes man is **a** **cause** of global warming. So if someone said, "yeah the earth is warming and man is responsible for 1% of it." That person would be included in the 97% number. Is that being honest? Probably not. In fact in a follow up paper cook claimed that 97% believe that man is the **main** cause of global warming which flat out contradicts his own findings.
In fact his own numbers, which he failed to report, showed only 1.6% believe man is the **main** cause. 
So clearly there is a consensus that man is **a** **cause** of climate change but to twist that into saying 97% believe man is the **main** cause is clearly being manipulative. 
Hopefully it doesn't take a masters degree to see that.

This isn't about some theoretically laboratory experiment. What percentage of brick-and-mortar merchants have actually been defrauded by accepting zero-confirm? I've never heard of a single one.
When deciding whether to accept bitcoin in their stores merchants are going look at the historical rate of double spends (which is very low) and try to forecast going forward. The reason brick and mortar stores accept bitcon is because this rate is so low. It's not hopes and dreams, it's reality. If it wasn't, they wouldn't accept it.

If that's the case I'm not sure why you would need a separate payment network. For me I'd like to see the most decentralized solution. If lightening is it then fine, but the cost of running a payment hub leads me to think that's probably not the case.


We know they desperately want to regulate bitcoin but the dynamic nature of the p2p network makes it almost impossible. 
But if it takes a million dollars to run a hub and, unlike the p2p network, the composition of the network doesn't frequently change, it will be substantially easier to regulate.

There is an assumption going around that the lightening network would be more decentralized than a Bitcoin network with larger blocks. I'm highly skeptical of that.
It will take hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars to run a payment hub. Far more than it will cost to run a node at any block size. 
If I were a regulator desperately looking to regular Bitcoin, I would be excited about the prospects of payment hubs that take an enormous amount of capital to run.

That assumes the lightening network will be decentralized though. What if we end up with 5000 bitcoin nodes but only 10 payment hubs?
I think it would be be a bit ridiculous to call that decentralized especially if it costs $5 to send a payment via the bitcoin network and the only alternative is to use a regulated payment hub that tracks all your txs and reports to the government. 
I don't know if that will be the outcome but it's certainly seems probable as the cost of running a payment hub will be much higher than a Bitcoin node.

Lightning is still *extremely* speculative and there's a sizable probability it may not be viable for payments at all. It would be reckless and irresponsible to bank the entire future of a product on it with no plan B. 


Given the amount of excess capacity on most laptops and home internet connections, it will probably be between 5-10 years before any actual (not self-imposed) bottlenecks are hit. By that time I'd expect further scaling optimizations to be mature. Maybe one of them will even be the lightning network!

The scorched earth policy requires that you overpay for the item, then get a refund for the difference after it confirms. Otherwise someone could effectively burn the amount of the transaction in fees and stiff the merchant.

That's an unproven (and very questionable) assumption as well. Just because fees are a larger percentage of revenue in the future doesn't mean that rational profit maximizing miners will find it in their long term interest to help defraud people for fees.
We've gone six years so far without anyone but a few tiny renegade miners doing it for ideological reasons. I think the reason for it is it's a repeating game scenario. Sure they can help defraud
someone in exchange for a higher fee in this block, but the next one they are likely to earn less as a result.
The calculus is pretty simple: Less utility for bitcoin = less people
making transactions = less fee revenue.
That doesn't change when fees are a larger percentage of revenue.

I'll let Andreas comment on his own code but typically a tx doesn't show as ConfidenceType.PENDING (which is what you have linked to) until it meets the threshold. 
The default behavior of bitcoinj btw is to automatically trust any nodes that you explicitly specify. So if you connected it to your own node to test this, then any txs it received from your node it would automatically set to ConfidenceType.PENDING without waiting for a threshold. 
I don't know how you would have tested it otherwise as it doesn't go out of it's way to connect to XT nodes (I don't believe that is implemented yet) and just connects to random nodes on the network.

If by barrier to entry you mean a legal barrier, then that is correct. However, it would be very expensive to run even a small hub. 100 users X $500 per channel (a guess) = $50,000. That's a major barrier to entry and will prevent the "you can run a payment hub for your bedroom" model.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:34:16
 I don't really know what he's talking about. There is a sense in which miners can't force people to use the new system, leaving miners off on a new fork and the rest of the users on the old one. 
In practice I doubt most end users will stay on a chain that has lost 95% of its hash power. If  miners plausibly believed that users wouldn't use their fork (making their newly minted coins worthless) then they probably wouldn't switch. 
In this case, it seems clear to me that the vast majority of end users support the block size increase so that's not likely to be the case.

That is a false claim. Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet (as do other bitcoinj wallets) only accept an unconfirmed tx if it relayed by a high threshold of its peers. Even with uneven propagation the probability of that threshold being met for this race example is pretty close to zero.

Bitcoin Wallet for Android doesn't even detect double-spends of
unconfirmed transactions when connected to a RBF or Bitcoin XT nodes
that propagate them. The least sophisticated double-spend attack
possibly - simply broadcasting two conflicting transactions at the same
time - has about 50% probability of success against these wallets.
That's bullshit as well. These wallets only accept an unconfirmed tx if some high threshold of peers relay it. In the above situation, barring uneven propagation, that threshold would not be met.
If the tx that sent coins to the wallet ends up winning the race, the wallet would only show it as received coins after one confirmation.
So basically spreading FUD to get this shit implemented.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:12:43


I think you are correct about risk of prosecution, but that seems to be a point in favor of zeroconf txs and likely explains (in part) why the rate of double spending is so low in practice. 


Online merchants can wait for confirmations. Even more so on a DNM. Nobody is suggesting that business that can afford to wait, should just accept zeroconf anyway. The only people who need to rely on zerconf are the coffee shops and other retail stores ― which would be mostly blown up by full RBF.
And I don't see why we can't simply tell them, "Look there is a risk of double spending if you take unconfirmed txs. You can look at the block chain and forecast your likely rate of fraud. At present it's well below 1%."
It doesn't make sense to slash people's tires because there is a risk they might get in an accident if they drive.

jtoomim's comments are on the mark. I would also point out that softforks achieve this magical protocol upgrade without disruption by relegating non-upgraded users to SPV level security without their consent. 
They download and run a full node thinking that they are fully validating the protocol rules and nothing can change that, then the core devs push a softfork that unknowingly drops them to a form of SPV. 
IMO harkforks are more ethical because at least there users can be given the option to either accept SPV security or upgrade (or continue following the minority chain). 
To that extent I favor adding a flag to core to "follow the longest chain of headers in the event of hardfork" in preparation for a future where we stop hacking up the protocol with softforks. Combine that with some more event hooks that maybe send an SMS or email to node operators notifying them of a detected fork in case they don't check the logs.

Payment hubs set up payment channels with all the users that connect to it. The hub needs to keep enough money in each channel so that those uses can accept payments (off chain) from anyone. How much is that? I don't know, it's an economic question. But I can't send you $1000 worth of bitcoin unless your payment hub has previously deposited $1000 worth of bitcoin in the channel it has with you. 
So let's just use $1000 as an approximation of what each hub would need to keep tied up in each channel (I don't know what the actual number is, but it seems reasonable). So with just 1000 users (which is a tiny amount) the hub needs to have $1M on hand in hot wallets. 
In reality hubs are likely to have much more than 1000 users. What will that cost? Your estimate of hundreds of dollars a month isn't anywhere close.


You seem to be confusing the services provided by miners (most of whom don't run nodes) with the services provided by full nodes. Mining centralization is largely a separate issue. 
The major concern with a network where nodes are run by only a few parties is it makes the network much easier to regulate. 
That concern doesn't go away with LN. If anything it's exacerbated as it will probably be much easier to regulate payment hubs when it takes millions to run one and only a few companies can afford to run it. 
To me the question is 'what is the least bad solution'? Until we see LN in operation and know how the economics of it shake out, we shouldn't just take it for granted that it will be an improvement in terms of decentralization.

See I largely disagree with this. Softforks allow you to claim compatibility while more or less relegating non-upgraded nodes to a form of spv level security (they follow a chain of headers they haven't fully validated). And they do this without the consent of the node operators. 
With a hardfork, full nodes could be given a choice to either 1) follow the old chain and ignore the fork. 2) accept the fork without validating it.
Notice  is more or less softfork functionality, but at least here node operators are explicitly choosing to trust the longest chain of headers without validating it. 
The case for softforks over hard is not as strong as it's made out to be imo.

I'm not sure if you're talking about the end users or the payment hub here. The payment hubs must keep their money tied up in the end users channels for them to be able to receive instant payments. That means they need to have the bitcoins on hand. Multiply the numbers of users of a hub by the amount large enough to cover expected recipients by those users and that's how much the payment hub must keep on hand. 
And payment hubs aren't going to be paying interest to people, rather collecting tx fees to compensate them for tying up their money. 


So if payment hub has $5000 worth of bitcoin on hand, then the most number of users they can have is 5 (give or take). Surely, that's not enough to cover the other costs of operating the payment hub. You should be able to see that running a payment hub at any scale is going cost orders of magnitude more than running a node. 


$100 isn't enough to facilitate off chain transaction for even one person. I think you fail to grasp how LN works. 
Watch the overview video of LN again and pay particular attention to the slide  which says "Bob has to be really rich for this to work": 
Notice he's talking about a single hub and spoke model when he says that not a model of multiple hubs. But all multiple hubs do is spread the capital requirement between them, it's still going to cost *a lot* to run a payment hub.


That is false. At those lower levels you can't even facilitate trade for 1 user.

You are mostly right but you need to consider that the present value of any asset is equal to it's discounted future value. Investors almost certainly have factored the halving into the current market price. 
Now given that the time discount is a discount for ... time... then we would expect the price to gradually rise as we get closer to the halving (assuming demand stays constant).

Yes! It makes bitcoin unusable for purchases at brick-and-mortar stores. 
Contrary to Peter's assertions, the probability of a merchant who accepts zero-confirm transactions getting defrauded is currently very low. Lower than credit card charge back rates and merchants are more than capable of calculating that risk (even more so given the public nature of the blockchain) and pricing it in to their products. 
This patch would dramatically increase the rate of double spends (the goals is basically a 100% success rate) and force merchants to require at least one confirmation. Which, of course, most brick-and-mortar stores cannot do. 
The only way to try to salvage it would be to use the scorched earth tactic which requires all buyers to pay extra for the product and get a refund after for the difference after it confirms. 
I contend the UX for that is so poor it would seriously harm bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:47:19


Yes, that's fine and 99.9999% of the time SPV will work perfectly. Which is why I don't have much of a problem with people using SPV (especially for amounts most typically transact in). But let's not pretend that non-upgraded nodes are not dropped to SPV. They simply are no longer fully validating nodes. 
The fact that they continue to validate the old rules is largely meaningless. As an analogy... If there were a hardfork where 99% upgraded and you were part of the 1% that didn't, it wont matter that the coins you accepted were valid according to the rules your node is following. Nobody else will accept them. 
That's unlikely to happen here because you are following the longest chain of headers, but the point is that validating the old rules doesn't not make it SPV.


That wasn't my point. 0-conf is a separate issue.


You are describing a 51% attack. The fact that miners can (in theory) 51% attack people doesn't mean that you aren't dropping non-upgraded nodes to SPV with a softfork.

It's less a technical discussion and more of a practical one. Will it work? Sure. Will people use it or drop bitcoin for something else?

Yes that's exactly it. The capital isn't consumed, it's an investment, but the whole point is it requires a massive amount of capital to invest that is going to be hard to raise. It isn't the case that someone can run a payment hub from their bedroom with 0.01 bitcoin. They will likely need to invest $1M + to facilitate trade of even a small number of users.

Further. It should be clear that a blockchain is a totally unnecessary as you aren't using it for timestamping or canonical ordering. You're using it for data storage which is about as retarded as it comes. You don't need a giant consensus network and massive hash rate for data storage.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:32:39
Yes another assumption is that LN will be decentralized. 
Consider how it works:
* Alice wants to send $1000 worth of bitcoin to Bob via a shared payment hub.
* Alice tells the hub it can pull $1000 in btc if it can produce a values that hashes to a given number.
* The hub tells the same thing to Bob.
* Bob produces the random number and pulls the $1000 to himself
* The hub gives the number to Alice and pulls the $1000 to reimburse itself. 
This requires that the payment hub has $1000 already tied up in the channel with Bob or else the payment cannot be made off chain.
This means a hub needs to basically have a ton of capital on hand (in hot wallets) to facilitate the trade of all its users.
The amount needed to run a hub with even a small number of users is likely to be in the millions. How many payment hubs can we reasonably expect?
People don't want to increase the block size because they think $50/month to run a node will produce a dangerously low number of nodes. Why would it then be acceptable to force everyone onto a network that requires millions of dollars to run a payment hub?
If the concern is creating an environment where it becomes easy to regulate bitcoin because of the high cost of running infrastructure, then I'd have some serious reservations about lightening. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:17:32


There are situations where it doesn't make sense to accept zeroconf. That may be one of them. Why can't it just be left up to the merchant to decide what level of risk is right for them?
As it stands, this will make all brick and mortar transaction unfeasible and prevent merchants for deciding for themselves based on the known risks.

6.5 coins isn't that much but unless you plan on spending them in the near future you should probably move them to cold storage (the keypair is generated on a permanently offline computer and the coins are sent to that address).

Can you elaborate on this? If a malicious user somehow manages to commandeer enough hashing power to extend a chain of headers longer than the main chain, and creates a transaction spending utxos that were created out of thin air, it seems to me the only fraud proof available is the entire utxo set. 
I can think of other scenarios you can create compact fraud proofs for, but if I'm an attacker, I'm not going to attack you using an attack which can be foiled with a fraud proof, I'm going to use the one for which no fraud proof exists (outside of just validating the whole chain).

My biggest concerns has always been that the economics will shake out that there are only a few major payment hubs that route everyone's payments. It could be like Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Blockstream, and that's it. 
It would be pretty disastrous if that's what happens as the devs have been making all these changes to Bitcoin precisely to push everyone onto the lightning network (deprecating zeroconf txs, jacking up tx fees for example).
And I'm not the only one with this concern, this was basically the topic of Poon's talk at scaling Bitcoin and he acknowledged this would be pretty bad.
The alternative is to have more organic routing where people's wallets try to find a route (I still have no idea how this can be done efficiently without a centralized routing table) to someone you want to pay, and if it can't find a route, it just opens a channel and leaves it open. Presumably, if everyone does this eventually there will become some organic routing paths for people to use to pay each other. 
So while that is much better, it remains to be seen if that type of routing is even feasible. Most people don't use wallets that remain online 24/7 to route people's payments which dramatically reduces the opportunity for organic routing and seems to create centralization pressure.

I don't think it's appropriate to say they're "backed" by the government. What does "backed" mean? It implies you can redeem the note for something of value (typically gold). The government won't redeem your notes for anything. They are literally pieces of paper. The only reason people accept them is because they believe others will do the same, largely based on historical precedent. The only thing the government can do to "back" or "guarantee" the value of the notes is to threaten people with imprisonment for not using them.

Supply (number of txs that fit in a block) is still fairly well ahead of demand, yet average transaction fees are not zero (even though the network allows some zero fee txs). The average fee is closer to 5 cents. People pay it make sure they cover the minimum relay fee and to tip miners for their service. 
Assuming average fees stay the same, the block subsidy would be completely replaced if volume were somewhere around 1/10 of VISA. That's without a "fee market". 
How such a network would look in terms of decentralization would be determined by how quickly (or how long) it takes to reach that volume and what the cost of hardware/bandwidth etc looks like at that time. I can't say if that would be good or bad, but it certainly doesn't imply that funding mining without increasing fees is impossible as people seem to suggest.

You totally fail to see the value in eBay and Etsy. I'm not surprised. Of course no seller will sell on those platforms at scale. Once you pass a certain size it make very little sense to spend 10% on fees when you could just built your own site and drive traffic to it. 
eBay and Etsy appeal to small (not large) sellers, because the costs to small sellers of driving traffic to your own webpage almost always eats up your margins. That's precisely why sellers use those platforms. If they outgrow the platform they move on and build their own site. 
OpenBazaar will be no different. I fully expect to only have small sellers on OB. That's what a bazaar is after all.

This is how it's supposed to work. If you can't find a route with the person you want to pay, just open a channel, leave it open, and then if you do this enough eventually you will start to find routes. Great.
But...... full RBF. If I want to pay for a cup of coffee and my lightning wallet can't find a route, no cup of coffee. I can't just open a new channel and pay, because with full RBF I can double spend the coins funding the channel before the channel confirms. This makes the entire model described above unfeasible. 
So the result of full RBF on lightning is to create centralization pressure and require that everyone use a few well-connected payment hubs to ensure that their wallet has a route to the person they want to pay. You wont be able to open channels on the fly (at least not in a retail setting), because you will need to wait for them to confirm.

The protocol adjusts the difficulty of mining every two weeks to try to target an average block interval of 10 minutes (a present 25 new Bitcoins every 10 minutes). So if more people bring mining equipment online, the protocol adujusts the difficult upwards to maintain that target. If people take processing power offline, the difficulty would decrease.


There are tiny transaction fees required on most transactions, primarily to discourage spam. These fees are also collected by the miners. Right now the fees don't amount to that much but the thinking is they will as transaction volume increases. 
So after we hit the 21 million coin mark, the compensation will be entirely transaction fees. But your right, if transaction volume is not high enough by then to provide an adequate incentive to mine, security could theoretically be compromised. But that won't happen until 2140, so we'll all be gone by then. The block reward should be adequate for a very long time.

This is just a recognition that 99% of end users are never going to want to keep a computer with a server up and running 24/7. For those people SPV works fine. As it stand today most aren't even using SPV and are just using trusted APIs, which I wish they didn't do.

What attacks would this actually allow?
* Traffic analysis - requires they either control the entry node or mitm the connection to the entry node.
* Sybil attack - can fake unconfirmed txs but not confirmed txs. Can DoS by refusing to relay txs.
* Linking Addresses - this shouldn't be possible if Tor is used correctlly. Lightweight wallets shouldn't send more than one outgoing tx over a connection. If you need to make a second tx you need to disconnect from Tor and reconnect using a different circuit. 
Am I missing anything? Possible traffic analysis seems to be the worst of the three... but that is always a threat with Tor.

The current protocol rules don't allow that. Usually fee replacement requires all outputs to be the same. 
There's grumblings by some people that the rules should allow for it since they believe miners will selfishly allow it anyway. But at present almost non do. And they shouldnt IMO.

You used to think you needed to use Tor to hide your identity but now you just do everything in the clear? That's what you seem to be implying. 
The entire protocol is public not just the DNS part. If DNS proxying provides a tiny amount of privacy when doing lookups big deal, everything else is in the clear.

The more pressing power the better since it reduces the probability a single person or institution could command 51% of the network.
Why not have it model something like climate change? Well it's mainly about security. The mining algorithm uses a cryptographic hash function designed to harden the network against attack. It's hard to say that a climate change algorithm would be as secure. 
Also you'd have to worry about altering the incentives if the algorithm was useful in multiple contexts. Ultimately since billions of dollars in value are at stake, I think the best thing to do is just use the algoirth that will be the most secure, which it does.

BIP32 allows for the creation of a Master key pair.  Using the master public key you can derive an unlimited number of child public keys, the private keys for which can be derived from the master private key.
You could theoretically put your master public key on a server and dynamically generate a new address for each new payee. This way you don't have to keep your private keys on the server.
The problem is that doesn't work in some use cases. For example, I have a basic WordPress blog with a static tip address. I cant dynamically generate a new address for each tipper because I don't control wordpress's server.
I could put my master public key on my blog, but then anyone can use that to derive all my addresses and see the balance of my wallet. 
The reason stealth was created was to allow me to put up a single address and receive payments to a new address each time without other people seeing my balance.

SPV nodes have no way to verify transactions (to weed out double spends) except to wait for the confirmations since they don't store a local copy of the block chain.
If all the nodes they connect to are malicious, they could double spend unconfirmed transactions and there would be no way to detect it until you noticed a lag in the block time.

It is using their API. 
But as far as MITM...unless the certificate authority is compromised, SSL should prevent that. The bigger issue is trusting OneName to serve up correct addresses. I don't have any reason not to trust them, but the whole point of Bitcoin is to make it all trustless.
I've talked to Muneeb before about improving the security of the API. I'd like it to serve headers and merkle proofs as well. Or for some implementation of it to do that.
For now the best we can do is cross check other servers. 
Also, stealth is a must with using OneName. We don't want to encourage address reuse. We really need to come up with solid stealth address implementation and make a push to get it merged into the core. Since it appears service bits are becoming fashionable, it maybe less controversial to do it as a service bit.

The reduction in the block reward is already built into expectations and hence into the price. One factor that may cause the price to rise is if the reduction goes smoothly (ie no forking).

You are quoting a paragraph on unconfirmed transactions. Transactions with many confirmations can only be faked by an attacker with 51% of the mining power.

I should have clarified by saying fixed supply *and* demand for money. Demand shocks are exogenous and have nothing to do with the supply of money.
The hypothetical assumes a "bitcoin-dominated economy".  In such a situation, absent demand shocks, it's false to claim nominal wages would fall. The falling prices, coupled with the same or greater (due to raises) nominal wages translates into a higher standard of living for the average person. 
That is how an economy is *supposed* to work.

Spv stands for splified payment verification. The wallet doesn't download the full blockchain, only the block headers. It means it's much lighter than a full wallet but there is a little bit of a privacy tradeoff. 
When downloading your transactions from a peer, you don't download every transaction and sort through them to see if they belong in your wallet. Instead you only download a smaller subset, say 10%, of the transactions and sort through that. 
So your anonymity set is smaller. We have a setting in the wallet where you can define the size of your anonymity set but anything less than downloading all transactions is inherently less private. 
Also full nodes relay all transactions so when they want to make a transaction, they just slip their own in with all the transactions they relay and the remote peers really cant tell if it came from them or is just a transaction that is being relayed.
Spv wallets don't relay, so the remote peer knows it's your transaction. Tor is basically your only protection here. 
So if you want the maximum privacy that the bitcoin protocol has to offer, run a full node and set it as the trusted peer for the wallet.

Correct although I would add the notary needs to verify that the inputs to the transaction have confirmed. Otherwise the payer could double spend the tx that sent coins to the multisig address which would prevent the tx to the merchant from confirming.
It's a rather ugly hack. I feel like we need to come up with something better.
@_date: 2014-08-29 07:10:44
I mentioned this below. The default way uses google cloud messaging. The wallet sends an encrypted message to the mobile app saying "I've got a new transaction for you, you can pick it up at this IP address".
The mobile app uses the IP address to make an encrypted and authenticated TCP connection to the wallet and downloads the transaction directly. 
I would stress that even though GCM is "centralized" it more or less is just a convenience feature. You can turn GCM off in the settings if you want. In that case the wallet will attempt to connect to the last known IP. If that connection fails, it will open the QR scanner and ask you to scan a qr displayed by the wallet containing an updated IP.
I myself wouldn't turn GCM off since there aren't any privacy concerns with it and it avoids a mild inconvenience of scanning a QR if your IP changes.

The whole point about this conversion is that I'm trying to fix this. 
The trust issue as well as stealth need to be upgraded if OneName is to be a viable way to send money. Until it is, don't use it with large amounts.
Also, if you tell someone your bitcoin address in a facebook message, reddit comment, unauthenticated email etc... you are also trusting those services not to lie about your address. In that regard OneName is no less secure right now then what I just mentioned. 
Only scanning a QR in person or using bip 70 are more secure.

1. There's still potential upside. If bitcoin takes over even a small portion if the gold market or tax shelters. If it gains wide acceptance in payments or remittances.... you could be looking at a price of $100k to $1m. But make sure you understand the risks.

It's right in the article, but there's a few caveats...
1) The NSA could try to execute Sybil attacks against people. That is, when you connect to the bitcoin network, the only nodes you connect to are run by the NSA. If that happened, they could steal your coins when you make a transaction. If you have even one normal connection, however, I'm not sure they could derive your private key faster than your transaction propagates. So that attack doesn't seem that likely. 
2) If everyone has a quantum computer bitcoin would cease to function since every node could derive the private key from every transaction they receive. But one would expect ECDSA to be switched out long before that. If it's just a few labs with quantum computers, then ya, just treat addresses as one-time use addresses until the algorithm is changed.

1. It's used to secure the network from attack. There really isn't any better way to do that. So the computational power isn't really going to waste. Doing 'useful' computations would likely be less secure and create perverse incentives.
2. Nope. It was public from the begining. Not many people knew about it or were interested enough to mine back then, but anyone could have.
3. Miners donate their processing power to the network to verify transactions (make sure they are valid) and do the work necessary to maintain a consensus in the public ledger and secure it from attack. The newly created Bitcoins are their compensation for providing this service.
4. The total processesing power in the network is hundreds of times greater than the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined (and growing).  Tech companies only have a tiny fraction of that computational power.
5. I don't know what dark enlightenment is, but there are plenty of libertarians here who believe the central banks distort the distribution of wealth, benefiting the few at the expense of the many. And they create economic bubbles (like the housing bubble) through their manipulation of interest rates causing economic instability. Bitcoin is a way to circumvent central banks without waiting for reform through legislation.
6. For one, past performance does not guarantee future performance. Nobody knows if it will keep going up.

The server doesn't learn anything about the participants in the coinjoin transaction. It's only there to facilitate it. It's essentially blind and anyone can run one.

So issue with CoinJoin is how to prevent other parties from learning your input/output mapping. Blockchain just asks you to trust their server which isn't a great option. Dark wallet limits mixing to two people to try to limit the damage. Obviously that reduces your anonymity and requires lots of txs to get a good mix.
My original plans which I started some preliminary work on was to create a CoinJoin server and use the wallet's internal Tor client to change Tor identities between stages (uploading inputs, outputs etc). It would work and would prevent the mapping of inputs and outputs. The actual implementation would be a little tricky but could be done.
Then I stumbled across the coinsuffle paper by Tim Ruffing and co-authers and it provides an extremely simple but robust method for hiding the input/output mapping using layered encryption.
I've talked to Tim. He seems interested in working with me. My main issue isn't the CoinJoin/shuffle but rather finding an appropriate communication channel. They use dissent, which is very complicated and python only. Reimplementing dissent in java is beyond my competency.

I made that tutorial video I linked to above. Just follow that.
It's much safer to keep your keys offline than on a server like blockchain.info. 
People still do get their keys stolen with 2FA. Presumably the attacker gets their hands on the backup file and your password with a key logger.
You won't get it stolen if your keys are offline. If you are worried about losing it, just keep multiple backups and put them in different locations. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:32:52
Correct. The transaction from Alice will use an address that is separate from your stealth address and no one will know what it is.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:29:48
That isn't correct. All wallets are implementing some form of HD. The seed creation process, while it's true it needs to be the same, will not guarantee compatibility. 
How you derive keys from that seed needs to be identical across wallets for there to be compatibility. As I said there isn't a consensus.
To give you a concrete example. In the wallet I've been developing we wanted to use the BIP0044 hierarchy to derive the keys (in addition to the BIP0039 word list) so that it will be compatible with trezor. 
However, BIP0044 requires that to create a new 'account' in the account level, the previous account must have been used for at least one transaction. 
This is a bit restrictive so I emailed Stick and Slush and asked them if they would consider amending BIP0044 to allow for more than one look ahead account to be created. They declined out of a desire to keep it simple. 
So as of right now, if you stick a seed from our wallet into trezor, trezor could fail to derive all the keys because of the different hierarchy treatment... despite the fact that both wallets use BIP0039. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:12:01
Think of it like this... How do you get someone else's address to pay them? They have to generate a new address and send it to you. But what if they are unreachable? Are you going to send it to a used address and leak privacy? 
You could say "send it to their stealth address". Sure that works great but what if you don't have it and they aren't available to get it? 
You could say, "let's make a PGP style key sever and put the stealth address in there" then people can query the key server for the stealth address.
But why use a centralized key server when namecoin is basically a decentralized key server? 
Put your stealth address in a decentralized key server, have it authenticated by a trusted party, and let people download it and pay you at their discretion. That's the whole idea. It's certainly an improvement over current practice.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:28:31
Your (encrypted) wallet is kept on blockchain's server. When your log in your wallet, the browser gives the wallet ID to the sever and the server returns the encrypted wallet...which is then decrypted with your PW.
2FA prevents someone else from downloading your encrypted wallet from their server (assuming no MITM like the Tor attack), but it does not make the wallet any more difficult to brute force for someone who is able to get their hands on the encrypted wallet. 
If you want better security you should use a multisig wallet. Greenaddress, bitgo, or you can play around with an [alpha version]( of the wallet I'm working on.

There is a common fallacy in there. If there is lots of hoarding, the exchange rate simply adjusts. It doesn't mean the volume of transactions will be lower only different nominal values.
Saving and spending or not mutually exclusive. I myself have a rather nice size bitcoin hoard which I do not spend, but that doesn't mean I don't spend any Bitcoins.

To be honest I'm not sure if this is the full story. Consider,
(1) It's easy for MtGox to verify the transaction did in fact go through. Just look at the recipient's address. It will contain a transaction for the same amount coming from MtGox's address.
(2) Presumably they have the ID of everyone who would try this exploit since you need to be registered to use the exchange. Who would try that I that circumstance?
(3) I was under the impression transactions for many people weren't going through. I doubt they would all be attackers claiming the transaction never went through. 
Most people would see it went through (under a different hash) and be content. They would only call and complain if it didn't go through, or they are the attacker.
Still sounds fishy to me.

You don't give out a seed, only a public key. The sender uses your public key, a random nonce, and some crypto algorithms to generate a new address from which only you have the key. 
Nobody else can tell the address belongs to you nor can the sender figure out your other addresses without knowing your private key.
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:18:00
It uses Google Cloud Messaging to initiate the connection. It doesn't send any sensitive (or unencrypted) data over GCM. The wallet basically says, "Hey I have a new transaction for you. You can pick it up at this IP address". 
Then the mobile app makes a direct (encrypted and authenticated) TCP connection to the wallet to receive the transaction. 
The only concern here about "centralization" here isn't privacy related, but rather Google Cloud Messaging going offline and there being a service outage. 
You can turn GCM off, however, and the mobile app will attempt to connect to the last known IP address. If it can't connect it will prompt you to scan a QR to get the current IP. 
Those hyper concerned about centralization can just turn GCM off from the start. Or set up a static IP and you wont ever need to scan a QR.

Not easier to mine, but smaller blocks propagate quicker. If two miners mine a block at the exact same time, the one that propagates quicker has a greater chance of earning the reward. Obviously smaller blocks means less transaction fees as well.


There's no good answer to this. All I can say is eventually only miners will download and store the block chain. Average users will just use lightweight spv clients. Hopefully there will be enough miners to maintain a level of decentralization.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:20:04
They aren't stored. You sign an input to the transaction. The transaction needs a certain number of coins to be valid. If you want to take your pledge back before the correct amount is raised you just double spend your coins.

One of the issues with stealth addresses is they can't work with P2P lite clients without a fork to make full nodes serve up data relating to stealth transactions.
Client/Server wallets like darkwallet or Electrum could implement their own solutions because they are server based. But not p2p clients.
There is also an issue with privacy in lite clients with stealth addresses. I believe dark wallet uses a form of prefix filtering which broadcast your anonymity set to the entire network. This is worse than bloom filtering in that at least with bloom filtering only the remote nodes see your anonymity set not everyone.
Greg Maxwell had a nice little proposal to xor the prefix with a random byte from the addresses. That puts a little more work on the server but it would greatly improve privacy, but to my knowledge (I could be wrong) dark wallet doesn't work like that.
This proposal from Mike would accomplish the same thing but more securely and with less stress on nodes by relying on a separate communication channel. Although it would be quasi centralized, it would still be private to use it and it would only be used when you need to make a "stealth" payment.
@_date: 2014-09-04 06:04:37


That sentence contradicts itself. The false positive rate is customizable. If someone finds the default rate too low for their preferences, they can set it higher.
I would take a .10 false positive rate over querying an electrum server for my exact addresses any day.

Transactions are potentially reversible in the first hour or so after receive bitcoins. Whether or not an attacker is successful at reversing a transaction will depend on how much processing power the attacker has relative to the size of the network and how lucky he is. 
In practice, it's darn near impossible for someone to get enough processing power to have a large enough chance to execute a double spend. 
With every new block that is added to the block chain on top of your transaction, it becomes exponentially more difficult to reverse the transaction. 
After six confirmations (about an hour) the odds of that happening are pretty close to zero. Even without waiting for the confirmations, the odds are still pretty low.

I think everything you wrote is correct. But, like you alluded to, I think it's a low probability that you and I will happen to transact with the same person before and after our exchange (and of course, use the same inputs).

The answer from binarysoup isnt completely accurate. The public key is not a hash of the private it key. Bitcoin uses ECDSA to generate the public key from the private key. It's a property of the elliptic curve cryptography that you aren't supposed to be able to derive the private key from the public key (given the current state of math and technology).
A bitcoin address is a one-way hash of the public key. Which means you can't derive the public key given the bitcoin address. But the public key is revealed when you make a tx.

Bitcoin is growing at the moment. If it were as widely used as the dollar it would increase in value each year because of its properties. When the economy grows faster than the supply of money, the value of money goes up. All other things equal. They print dollars like they're trying to run out of ink. So they supply of dollars grows faster than the economy and the value goes down.

Bob will end up seeing, "Hey let's use purple as our public color" and both Alice and Bob will think they've established a shared secret with each other, but in reality will have established one with Eve.
Alice and Bob need to either select the public color in person (at which point why not just pick a shared secret in person) or use some kind of public key infrastructure (PKI). 
Or, if they know something about each other that Eve does not know they can use the Socialist Millionaire's Problem to authenticate each other.

New addresses are created with sha256(seed + n) where n starts at zero and gets incremented to however many addresses you want. 
When recovering a wallet from a seed, there's usually a "gap limit". What that means is when generating new addresses, if it hits, say five unused addresses in a row, then it assumes that's all of your addresses. You can usually set the gap limit to whatever you want.

The thing you need to keep in mind is that stealth addresses have a limited use case. People hear of stealth addresses and think they are more private than normal addresses. They aren't. In fact they are potential less private when used with lite clients and prefix filtering.
In most normal situations a payee is able to generate a new address and communiate it to the payer. In this situation there is no need for stealth. It's extra work with no extra privacy.
Stealth is only for those situations where the payer and payee do not have an open communication channel.... Like a static tip address on a blog. In those situations stealth allows just as much privacy as a "normal" payment but that's really about it.
There might be some cool extensions you can do with it like some kind of identy system like OneName. Instead if putting a static address in the namecoin blockchain I could store a stealth address. Then to send me a payment you could just send it to +ChrisPacia and the wallet can query the blockchain to get my stealth address and send it there. You can do that without stealth but it isn't private.
But also note that you can do that with the URL scheme mike is talking about as well. The servers would only be relied on for these limited use cases.

If you are importing the key into an online wallet for spending you don't want to reuse it because it could be compromised. It defeats the purpose of cold storage.
If you are spending from the paper wallet correctly (offline tx created on an airgapped computer) you could reuse the the same paper wallet but you have to be careful with the change address. Most wallets will generate a new address for change then send your balance there, not back into the paper wallet address. If you don't realize this, and delete the key to the change address, you will lose your coins.
If you explicitly specify the change to be sent back to the paper wallet then you can reuse it. Again assuming you are doing offline transactions correctly.

That isn't even close to what happened. Adam Back (one of the few people mentioned in Satoshi's white paper) had been toying with the idea for quite sometime and recruited another extremely talented developer to work with him on it. 
You could email them and ask what the progress is, but I wouldn't underestimate them. Adam is one of the smartest people in the cryptocurrecny space.

If a bank did that it would be insolvent. All fractional reserve banks strive to match assets with liabilities. There isn't any other way to do it.


Does it really make a difference if it loans the funds directly or buys loans from someone else who issued the loans directly? The "low risk" securities they are referring to are loans. Probably loans to the government to boot.


That's exactly what fractional reserve is.

You don't get it. The whole point of mining is you "vote" for which chain you believe is valid. With POW you can only cast one vote because there is a very real cost of hardware. With POS you can cast an unlimited number of votes. There's no opportunity cost for voting. Hence its trivial to attack a POS coin.
The point is there is nothing at stake.

Well the idea for a facilitating server is just to improve the user experience. If you didn't want to use it you don't have to. If your IP changes you can just repair the devices, takes only a couple seconds. The server just helps avoid that inconvenience.

Must've missed that part. 


You are correct here. I haven't really thought of a great solution except to make it a general rule that if you lose a key either present or past.. Then you shold junk your name and create a new one.
Either way it's an experiment. I wouldn't trusted unauthenticated data right now with anything more than pocket change. The point is to improve it. 
I do tell people it is no less secure than sending someone your address in a Facebook message, unauthenticated email, reddit post etc... Just don't do it with large amounts. 
But it seems to me using a decentralized key server is a better alternative to putting keys in pgp keys which will inevitably get uploaded to centralized server

The primary benefit for many people is having a currency that increases in value rather than depreciating. You won't have a portion of your wealth siphoned off to the banking class. Neither would you be forced to gamble in the stock market in search of returns (unless you want to). I would think people would tend to prefer this to the alternative.
Add to that much faster and cheaper payments, vastly improved privacy and censorship resistance and there's a rather large value proposition.

Many wallets will let you create and sign raw txs. Armory, bitcoin core, Electrum. You don't necessarily need to do it manually. Just push the raw tx once you get back into your normal OS.
Either way scriptSig is the portion of the transaction where you provide the script (which includes the signature) needed to satisfy the scriptpubkey from the previous tx. The only way to do that manually would be with code. pybitcointools is probably the easiest.

Let's say Alice and 10 of her friends all list each other and only each other in the UNL. 
Bob and his 10 friends all list each other and only each other in the UNL. 
In this case there will be no consensus. The two groups will have divergent transaction histories and there is no way to resolve the fork. 
The only solution is for Alice's group and Bob's group to each trust some universally trusted parties. 
At that point, it doesn't matter what Alice's friends or Bob's friends think, the transaction history will necessarily be controlled by those few parties. It has to be like this otherwise you have no way to resolve forks. 
That isn't adding decentralization, it's centralization. It's emblematic of the problems with web of trust... it necessarily devolves into a handful of universally trusted parties.

It could maybe be configured to work like that. I considered scanning the tx from a qr code but I wanted it to be smoother from a ux standpoint.
Other options are opening a port or your server or using [Web RTC]( 
I think web rtc is a good option then the communication doesn't need to go through your server. I believe the bitcore team is using it for the p2p connection on their wallet.

If the payoff is over such a long time horizon that it is unprofitable to invest, that implies the investment is not commensurate with people's actual preferences. 
We would not want the state to fund such projects in that case because it ultimately implies creating less value for people than what could have been produced with those resources. The fact that some projects don't come into existence (at least at present) does not imply redirecting resources from present projects into the government chosen projects will increase value.

No it doesn't. If those nodes aren't universally trusted they are meaningless. They are the equivalent of non-mining nodes in bitcoin. Only the handful of universally trusted nodes will control the network. That's a far cry from bitcoin where there are thousands of miners. 
As for bitcoin, we don't know exactly what direction mining will take. It's still relatively decentralized at the moment and while there are some incentives pushing for centralization, growing popularity is attracting a greater absolute number of users. What will be the outcome of those two forces remains to be seen. Satoshi predicted an equilibrium of 10,000 miners and it may or may not achieve it. 
We know what we get with Ripple. Web of trust doesn't scale in PGP and it certainly wont scale in Ripple (it was more or less abandoned from the beginning).

Technically no. If a large number of pools reject valid transactions (like pay to correct horse battery staple) the tx will still propagate but not be confirmed. The sender could likely wait hours before broadcasting the double spend which would render double spend detection ineffective.
The only way to combat that would be to evaluate incoming valid txs for the likelihood they will be rejected by a large number of miners and flag them. Seller would have to ask for another form of payment and refund the tx if it confirms.

Change the default operation of wallets. That will already largely be happening with the new payment protocol. Stealth addresses are just the second half of that.

Ya they both do SPV. Electrum connects to a single node (server), bitcoinj clients connect to random nodes in the p2p network. 
Bitcoinj uses bloom filters when downloading your transactions to make it difficult for the peers to figure out which transactions are actually yours. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression electrum doesn't use anything similar and thus the server knows which addresses are in your wallet.

If someone robs a bank and proceeds to launder the funds, the crime was the bank robbery not the subsequent money transfer. Law enforcement should focus on stopping the robbery, not demanding everyone be inconvienced and innovation crushed because it makes their investigation easier.
The NSA also claims that spying on everyone makes it easier to stop terrorism. Whether that is true or not still doesn't justify violating everyone's rights.

How would a merchant check that the address is green? Would the notary distribute a single public key that everyone would use? If so that would allow everyone to see which txs are green and which aren't potentially harming privacy.
I suppose you could also do something like x.509 certificates, but wallets need to be setup for that.
What were your thoughts?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:05:54
There are two different ways to execute a double spend:
1) Try to send a valid tx directly to the merchant while simultaneously sending a double spend to many miners. Merchant sees valid tx first, miners see double spend first. Double spend makes it into the block
2) Mine the next block with your double spend in it.
 is easily defeated by simple double spend detection. The merchant's wallet can just throw up a flag warning of a potential double spend. The cashier can ask for another form of payment. If the tx does go through, the merchant can just issue a refund.
 takes an incredible amount of resources and luck to pull off. If you have 10% of the processing power in the network, that only gives you a ~10% chance of success. That 10% will cost you tens of millions (maybe hundreds) to acquire. 
If someone were to make that kind of investment, it's unlikely it would be used to rip off retail stores. 
So bottom line, retail merchants can be fairly confident in zero confirmation transactions. They only need to make the customer wait on extremely high value transactions.

This is absolutely false. In the face of a fixed supply of money, only those goods and services that increase in supply will fall in price. 
Since the supply of labor tends to be fairly stable, so will be nominal wages.
*If* you want to argue that nominal wages will fall due to population growth, this will tend to only apply to starting wages. Most people tend to get raises as they become more productive and advance in their careers. At best population growth would slow the rate of raises for these people but it's doubtful it would put downward pressure on nominal wages.
So all around false claim.

Bitcoin and Ripple are completely different. I don't think you understand that ripple is trying to build a crytocurrency platform around web of trust. Show me an implementation of web of trust that works at scale?
Um.. that is x.509... which is quasi centralized. And the reason for that is web of trust simply doesn't work outside of a small circle of people. It devolves into centralization. 
You have this image of ripple where it doesn't suffer from these problems. That world doesn't exist.  Again, Ripple is not bitcoin. Adding thousands of nodes doesn't change a fundamentally flawed model.

But, of course, that isn't true. Bloom filtering isn't as private as running your own node and setting it as the trusted peer, but it is clearly more private than handing your addresses over to a server run by someone you don't know.

This post will likely be very misleading most people. The wordlist is only part of what is needed for compatibility. The other part is for both wallets to use the same bip32 hierarchy. If they don't, a seed from one will not work in the other. 
As of right now very few wallets use the same hierarchy because developers can't agree on a single one covers all use cases. 
In the wallet I'm developing we wanted to use the bip44 hierarchy so it is compatible with trezor, but bip44 calls for only one account to be created at a time..   
Even though we use the same hierarchy, our wallet allows the user to create more than one new account at a time. Stick and slush didn't want to amend bip44 because they wanted to keep it simple. So if you stick a seed from our wallet into trezor... some coins might not be recovered. 
The fact that a seed from bread wallet doesn't work in coinpunk isn't surprising.. You'll be hard pressed to find two wallets where the hierarchies are compatible.

That's true but it happens through multiple rounds of lending.
1) Despoitor depsits $100.
2) Bank loans out $90 
3) Depositor deposits $90
4) Bank loans out $81.
5) Repeat until $1000 in loans have been made.
If it were the case that the depositor deposited $100 and the bank tried to loan out $1000 (which it's probably legal to do except for capital requirements), there would be an instant bank run.
1) Depositor deposits $100 at bank A
2) Bank A loans $1000.
3) Borrower writes a check for $1000 to a customer of bank B.
4) Bank B cashes the check.
5) Bank run.

If this becomes the default type of address, it's hard to see how it wouldn't provide significant anonymity. 
If *every* bitcoin user is generating new addresses for each transaction, how do you link transactions to identities?

The primary difference is this still requires an internet connection on your phone which means, unlike trezor, we can't say there is zero probability your device could be compromised. In practice however, it's very difficult to get malware on your Android phone. As I mentioned in the post, Android has a 7 layer defense that requires the user to consciously disable each layer to get infected. And most users don't even know how to do that. Of course, it is possible someone will find vulnerabilities in Android in the future, though the same could be said for trezor as well.
In a future release we will add Bluetooth support so the phone doesn't need an internet connection. You could take an old phone, wipe it and restore the factory settings, disable the internet connectivity, and have the only Bluetooth permission be for the authenticator app and it will provide near hardware wallet-like security. 
That's my plans for my Nexus 5 when I get a new phone at least.

I'm *pretty* sure the way it works is blockchain.info generates and 80 bit key and presents it to you in the QR.
You scan the QR with Google auth. now Google auth has the key.
To create the one-time password Google auth takes hmac-sha1(key, unixtime/30) then takes the first few bits and converts them to base10 and displays it to you as your one-time password.
To verify the password blockchain.info takes hmac-sha1(key, unixtime/30) and compares the first few bits to the bits you entered. If they match, it let's you in. No server is needed.

Ya it is. I lost track of what tread I was posting in, but I made that comment. 
I'm not sure which other wallets are using BIP44. The problem I found with it was that it only allows one new account to be created at a time. 
Specifically, an account must have at least one transaction in it before you can let the user create a new one after it. 
I emailed stick and slush to see if they would considered amending it to allow more look ahead accounts to be created but they just wanted to keep it simple. 
So right now, if you stick a seed from my wallet into Trezor, the trezor could fail to derive all the accounts (and hence keys). 
The issue is that for every hierarchy proposal, some developer is going to find that it doesn't cover all of their needs, as in this case. Which is why coming to an agreement on a 'standard' hierarchy is difficult.

There are a couple problems with P2SH. 
1) They use more space in the blockchain than a normal transaction. Hence you have to pay more in tx fees. 
2) They are distinguishable from regular addresses (as we see from this post) and can potentially constitute a privacy leak in some instances. 
3) P2SH is limited in the number of keys that can be used.
A threshold signature uses a standard pay-to-pubkey-hash addresses but the private key is instead broken into 'shares' similar to Shamir's Secret Sharing.
The difference between SSS and a threshold signature is...
1) With a threshold signature the key doesn't need to be generated on a single device and then split... instead the shares can be created independently of each other.
2) The shares do not need to be brought together and combined to create a valid signature. Each share creates a sort of partial signature then they are combined to produce the valid signature.
So using threshold signatures allows you to do multisig using standard bitcoin addresses and avoid the problems with P2SH.
We will likely be switching to threshold signatures in our project in our project sometime in the future.

You're really a fallacy factory. You've managed to completely ignore opportunity costs.
The reason private sector companies weren't investing in space flight up until recently is because space flight in the 1960s etc created far less value for society than what otherwise would have been produced with those resources. 
Had the government not plowed billions into the space program, it would have been allocated to much more pressing needs and who knows what innovations would have come out of it, or how much more developed other sectors would be today.

Yeah I get it but I'm not sure higher costs to run a node will necessarily result I'm fewer nodes. If adoption increases (which is what a growing tx volume would imply) I suspect the node count will go up with adoption. 
I have a hard time seeing a 40x increase in bitcoin users that doesn't result in some of those new users running nodes. 
I think at least some of the push back is people want to preserve the ability for people to run a node in their house. But, at least to me, that stopped being practical years ago and I don't really have a problem with a network where the nodes are run by commercial enterprises as long as the number of nodes is equal to or greater than what we have today.

The main problem is wallets are encrypted with user chosen passwords. Many people do not realize that at this point just about any memorable password can be cracked in about an hour with modern password cracking software. Long passwords only protect against brute force but password crackers don't use brute force so length really doesn't matter in this context... a password cracker will have no problem creaking a 15 character PW. 
So my guess is 90% of the encrypted wallets sitting on blockchains servers could be decrypted in several hours by either blockchain themselves or an attacker who gains access to their servers.
The only fix would be to encrypt the wallet with at least 128 random bits. But for some reason they don't do that despite all the users getting hacked.

This is FUD. The "default" false positive rate still gives a reasonable privacy. From the documentation.

     * keys/addresses which will be thought to be yours by nodes which have your bloom filter, but which are not
     * actually yours.&lt;/p&gt;
Also note the false positive rate can be changed. The wallet I'm developing has it as a setting.

Payment hubs need to have an extremely large amount of capital (likely in the millions of dollars) on hand or else payments cannot be processed.

Ya twitter isn't decentralized. And also I think the long term vision is to have wallets qurrey the blockchain for your address. So users literally only type +chrispacia into the wallet and it fetches the address. Much more convenient. And just like email, you still need some other channel to verify you have the correct name. Most of the time, people just tell it to you.

Also a reminder that 2FA is not a be all end all for blockchain.info. The way that service works is it encrypts your wallet with your password only.

Even the ripple exchange is shady IMO. There's a reason web of trust isn't widely used. It's because it's near impossible to have a large enough web to link you to everyone you want to communicate with. With money and finance we would expect the scope of trust to be *much* less. Meaning there will always need to be centralized parties facilitating exchanges. 
I wish they would drop the decentralized pretext.

That is more or less the point of multisig. As an example if you use the wallet I linked to... There are two sets of keys, one on your computer and one on your phone. Both sets need to be stolen to steal your coins. Even if someone compromises your desktop and steals the (encrypted) wallet file, they can't spend the coins without the keys on your phone.
And when a transaction is made from the desktop, you get a notification on the phone asking you to approve it.

Keep in mind the fees that larger blocks would generate. People are concerned that a falling block subsidy will harm the network, yet with only 30 mb blocks the fee would complete replace the subsidy.

I'm pretty sure that will never happen. Doing so would just be the equivalent of saying, "People must use the official US government fork of bitcoin core". Which no one will do. Hence, such regulation would just be the equivalent to making bitcoin illegal in the US. 


What is the rationale for believing it will be easier to regulate bitcoin miners in a world of larger blocks, then payment hubs in a hub and spoke model? My understanding is that payment hubs also require a large capital investment to start up.

Mission accomplished
@_date: 2015-05-07 05:55:10
Fwiw, I'm with Mike and Gavin on increasing the limit. 
* Decentralization is often quoted as a reason against raising the limit and something like the lightening network an alternative. Yet there will likely be far fewer payment hubs in the lightening network as they take a large amount of capital to startup. Much more than running a node at the 20 mb block size. Hardly an improvement in dectralization. 
* The number of nodes is likely to be much more a function of bitcoin adoption than the cost to run a node. If at some point in the future merchants are not using payment processors and instead are keeping/spending the coins it's not hard to imagine all medium to large size businesses running their own nodes. That would put the node count in the millions making these arguments irrelevant. Maybe that future never comes to be, but it's hard to see a large increase in bitcoin use that doesn't come with a large increase in nodes. The recent declines are more likely due to the fact that in the early days you had very few choices in wallets and most people just ran bitcoin core. 
* There is concern that the falling block reward will harm seruity if not sumplimented by higher fees. But how much can fees go up without causing people to stop using Bitcoin in favor of alternatives? To completely replace the block reward with fees in a 1 mb block limit the fee would need to be $1.36 per transaction. Is that competitive? I doubt it. On the other hand, at today's fees a 30mb block would completely replace the block reward.

There were no such upgrades. Softforks do not require 95% of all users...  only 95% of mining pools. Which is like 10 tops.

While it's possible for wallets to allow it (some do), free transactions may not be confirmed. If the fee is too low miners will not include it in their blocks. 
The 'default' rules do allow for a percentage of the block to contain free transactions (if other things are met), but miners are free to change the default rules and make their own. 
So if you send a tx without a fee you risk it sitting there for quite some time, not knowing if/when it will confirm.

There isn't any need for that. Miners get paid according to the proportion of work they contribute to a pool and pools get paid according to their percentage hashing power.
It's all proportional. Something is screwy with the quote above because all pools should pay out approximately the same just with different variance.
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:57:34
I'm aware how many nodes there are. If we go up to 20mb that's something like 50x increase in tx volume. If usage goes up that much you don't think the number of people/businesses running nodes will increase?
That's even more the case if merchant's accept bitcoin directly instead of with a payment processor (which is the goal right?). 
Serious question, how much do you see it costing to run a node if the limit is raised and volume goes way up? 
I don't see any scenario where it isn't a drop in the bucket for most firms. I wouldn't be surprised to see chain stores running a node in each store. 
Would it be out of the price range for people looking to run a node in their house? Probably. But I don't see why that needs to be the end goal.


It's because the fork will take a year to roll out and we will likely hit capacity by then. And there is zero chance the lightening network or something similar will be up and running by then.

It largely is an anti-spam thing. If the fee was set by supply and demand it would be near zero as the miners are not the ones actually storing the transaction on disk.

The best privacy you can have is if you use a wallet connected to a full node. Basically your options are bitcoin core and armory or possibility some mobile wallets will let you direct your client at your own node. I know Andreas' "Bitcoin Wallet" on android allows this.
The reasons for using a full node is because there are two primary areas for privacy leaks:
* Sending: Since a full node relays all transactions it can just slip its own in amongst those it's relaying. Nobody else will know the transaction came from you (Note: there is a very difficult to execute theoretical attack here that is easily defeated by using Tor).
* Receiving: Since the full node receives all transactions it can just pick its own out of the list and no one will figure out which transactions were intended for the wallet.
What about lightweight wallets?
* Sending: lightweight wallets don't relay transactions so any transaction you send to a peer/server they know definitely came from you. In a perfect world you could "trust" your server but we don't live in a perfect world. 
So your only recourse is to connect to the peers/server using Tor/vpn. Even here you need to take care to use a different Tor identity for each transaction otherwise the peers/server will know both (or more) transactions came from the same wallet. 
As far as I know the wallet I'm developing (over at bitcoinauthenticator.org) is the only wallet to connect to Tor automatically so you don't need to download additional software and configure the settings (we have not yet implemented changing Tor identities between transactions however).
* Receiving: this is extremely difficult to do privately in a lightweight wallet. Most wallets just hand a list of your addresses over to the server and ask for the transactions. The problem here is while you can do this over Tor and have the list of addresses be 'pseudonymous', anyone you transact with knows your real world identity and the address you paid from. If that information could be combined with the 'pseudonymous' list of your addresses then your entire transaction history is deamonymized. The more transactions you make, the easier such an attack becomes, especially for law enforcement. 
To make this attack more difficult *some* wallets use bloom filtering or prefix filtering to give the server/peers an obfuscated view of the addresses in your wallet. The peer/server would match transactions against your filter and return a number of transactions, say 10,000 for example, which includes your transactions. Your wallet would sort through it and pick out yours and discard the rest. Ideally the server wouldn't know *which* of those 10,000 transactions belong to you giving you a decent amount of privacy. 
In reality, it's extremely difficult (I would argue impossible)  to implement bloom/prefix filters in a way that doesn't have privacy leaks in at least some scenarios. In practice, no wallet even comes close to implementing them correctly and all contain quite a few privacy leaks. 
Fixing the bloom filter implementation is a priority of mine, but as I said, it will still have leaks I'm some instances (absent use of coin mixing that is). 
Long term I intend to have the wallet send the transaction directly to the recipient over another (encrypted) communication channel. That way the recipient doesn't need to download transactions, only upload them. 
And finally, like the other commenter said, you must use a new address for each transaction. But even here there are attacks. Imagine Alice sends coins to Bob who sends them to Charlie who sends them to Dan. Alice and Dan could collude to figure out Bob and Charlie transacted with each other. 
If you have transactions that need to be completely private you should definitely mix them before sending the coins to the recipient. 
A purely P2P coinjoin implementation is another thing I'm working on.

I think you're misunderstanding Coinshuffle. There is no time delay because a single transaction is published. This is different from a mixer. 
Also, any coinshuffle implementation will use like size outputs. You won't be able to join a session unless your output size matches that of everyone else's.
A disclaimer, I'm working with the author of that paper to develop a p2p Coinshuffle implementation. Coinjoin isn't the difficult part, it's finding the right communication channel. Ive had a bit of a set back because I started some work on p2p coinjoin network but had to scrap it because I thought up a much better communication protocol which I'm now working on in part with the open bazaar devs.

Not that accurate. Nodes that accept payments are the ones enforcing the rules because that is where miners would try to spend any coins they minded using alternative rules. If you run a node just for the sake of running a node, you aren't enforcing the rules at all. Miners won't care if you run one or not because they weren't going to buy anything from you anyway.

This is the modern banking system. It works exactly as you describe (on paper) but yet there are plenty of people who can't get a bank account (wikileaks being a great example). The issue is if the payment layer isn't sufficient decentralized, the government isn't going to sit by and watch millions in payments flow through institutions without regulating them.
Abset any payment layer that is just as censorship-resistant as an on-chain transaction, on-chain transactions should remain affordable and available for people who need them.

That's exactly it. Observers only have a 1/25 chance of correctly guessing which output you sent your coins to. If you mix with 100 people it will only be a 1% chance. People who require more anonymity can do multiple rounds of mixing if they want.


Coinshuffle is just an implementation of coinjoin with some added stuff to prevent other parties in the tx from learning the input/output mapping. It's fairly standard practice that coinjoin has to use like size outputs for it to be effective. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:26:37
Nodes process and relay transactions and blocks while storing the blockchain. 
Miners use the transactions fed to them by a node to perform the proof of work necessary to add a new block to the chain. Miners may run their own nodes, but many just connect to a pool (which runs its own node).
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:21:59


This is a little misleading. The whole idea is to get everyone to stop reusing addresses. If *everyone* only uses addresses only once how can Eve determine who Bob paid or who paid him? The addresses that link to her's in the block chain were all generated at the moment of the transaction and were never reused. How does she know who they belong to?
There are small exceptions like where Alice receives a payment from Eve, sends the same inputs to Bob and Bob sends the same inputs back to Eve. Then yes, Eve can make the connection.
But those situations are low probability events. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:12:16
What base layer is used is irrelevant. If you used gold, which isn't controlled by central banks, you would also be regulated just because governments find it very easy to regulate stationary institutions (and people who tried it have been shut down by the government). Why would we expect institutions which relay bitcoin for customers to be any different?
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:33:00
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:01:23
In order to generate the address you need a private and public key. Satoshi must have the private key. He can release the public key and we can hash it to see if it matches the address. If so, we know it's the right public key. 
In fact releasing the public key should be enough to identify him, but future messages could easily be signed with the private key.
@_date: 2015-05-21 08:45:31
I haven't read the paper yet but off the top of my head it seems a major benefit would a reduction in the size of a stealth address. 
Currently we have to use two keys (scan and spend) to avoid keeping the keys to the coins unencrypted. 
We could derive both keys from a master public key and have the wallet store the child scan private key unencrypted but the key leakage prevents that. 
Should this work, we could use a single public key for stealth addresses making them much shorter.

We don't have any experience with it nor any solid ideas about how to go about creating one.

We have a similar problem in OpenBazaar. The other party signs the transaction and sends the signature. If it's too low you can't exactly go back and say, "hey I need another signature with a higher fee" as the other party may be offline. 
I think the only options are to just use CPFP (which isn't fully supported) or send signatures for a half dozen fee levels whenever sending sigs. Neither option is very good.

It isn't Electrum specific per se, the following applies to most spv wallets.
* Server can withold transactions (DoS). (Maybe less likely in a p2p wallet where it connects to a dozen random peers.)
* Server can fake unconfirmed txs since you don't have the utxo set to check validity. (Again p2p wallets try to gauge validity by the number of peers to relay).
* Electrum doesn't use filtering which means the server knows which addresses are in your wallet. Combine that with each time you make a tx the recipient knows your real world identity. If that data could be combined with the list of addresses known by the server, your tx history would be de-anonymized. 
Some wallets use bloom or prefix filtering to try to prevent this leak, but it's not perfect.
* Sending multiple txs from the same Tor identity tells the server they came from the same wallet. (Not that it matters if you've already given a list of addresses to the server).
 
Also, I could be wrong but I don't think the Tor attack would work with electrum since it uses SSL.

Bloom filtering, while broken in the current implementations, could be made to work well without any changes to full nodes.  The main issue is you won't be able to restore your wallet from seed without blowing the privacy gained by the filter. 
If that's an acceptable tradeoff it would be worth building a wallet that does it. It would probaly take several days worth of work to refactor bitcoinj. It would be a nice project for someone with some time on their hands.

wut. I hope you're not thinking proof of work has something to do with this.


So you are basically admitting that the only difference is the number of nodes the data is replicated on. Which is to say there is no difference. If bitmessage had 100,000 nodes, then by your definition bitmessage would be 20x more secure. 
When pruning is finally turned on all the way the number of archival bitcoin nodes (which drop zone will need) will be tiny. It's possible the number of nodes OB data is replicated on could exceed that. 
So basically the blockchain isn't needed at all for your definition of "censorship resistance", data replication is. And using a blockchain has to be the dumbest possible way to get data replication. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:22:08
It's correct that it doesn't count nodes but what it does is arguably worse. It just activates arbitrarily and hopes it doesn't result in a chain splitting hardfork. It's the worst possible way to update the protocol. Much worse than hardfork signalling via hash power.

Well that's not exactly true, ebay runs servers owned by one company. The content you see in OB is pulled from many nodes across the network who are free to join and leave at their discretion. Preliminary work has already been started on making store data more distributed such that listings, images, profiles, etc will be stored on and downloaded from multiple nodes. 


That's not true either. The network design decisions were made with NAT traversal in mind not preventing Tor usage. And Tor can still be integrated in the current design using onioncat. There's also been progress on integrating i2p as well. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:51:29

There isn't any formal write up, but right now when you visit a store the data is cached on your node so it doesn't have to be re-downloaded every time. Like bittorrent, once you download it you will begin seeding it to other users. Over time data gets replicated on more and more nodes.
I've just held off on wiring this up because what I've described is basically IPFS and it makes more sense to just use that when we're ready.

I don't know if I do buy that. Blasting out the headers over UDP eliminates almost all that latency for miners. Plus an IBLT built custom for peer would result in even the contents transmitting very fast. 
Either way I do agree that people need to pay for decentralization. I just view censorship resistance as really the only interesting part of bitcoin and don't want to see it devolve into just another form of banking.

Litecoin was a near 1 to 1 clone of bitcoin (with very minor tweaks). The way markets work is they tend to consolidate around a single currency as a medium of exchange. Without any improvements over bitcoin, there is no reason for anyone to use litecoin or any of the me2 altcoins out there.

It's used for transactions (same as in OB and bitmarkets) but it has nothing to do with "censorship resistance" of listing data.

Er no. Censorship resistance was solved before the blockchain came around. Bitcoin was given a p2p design because other similar networks had proven robust against censorship. 
The innovation behind bitcoin was it solved the problem of distributed consensus. The process by which it does so is horrifically inefficient and really only useful for that one task. If distributed consensus is not needed — like in hosting for example ― it's a total waste to use the blockchain.
I doubt you would find any serious developer who would do anything but laugh at the idea of using the blockchain for hosting.

They arent preferable IMO. The main issue is one of consent. Softforks can be rammed through without the consent of node operators whereas a hardfork asks for their consent. 
We could ram a blocksize increase through as a softfork, but we don't do it that way because it would (rightly) come across as underhanded.

The reason we don't have consensus is there are different visions of what the blocksize limit should do. This proposal uses it purely as an anti-spam mechanism (which was the original intent) whereas others want to use it as a policy tool to set fees.

Yes the reason was because people we're putting data in the blockchain in ways that couldn't be deleted from the utxo set before and forcing it to persist in everyone's memory forever. 
They didn't put in op_return to give people the ability to put data in the chain, they did it to prevent people from doing it in even more harmful ways. OP_RETURN is there so it can be deleted. Also note that Open Assets, etc put that data in the chain because they need it for *consensus*. It isn't garden variety hosting of product listings.

Also, onename isn't requirement to send coins. You can still send the old fashioned way, or use BIP70.

If all the nodes go down how does one find data for sale on "drop zone"? That's a dumb response.


No. That is true of you are trying to double spend. But you aren't using the blockchain for double spend protection, you are using it for hosting. The fact that you can't see the difference is really showing off your ignorance to how bitcoin works. Proof of work says nothing about how easy or hard it is to download listing data from a p2p network. It's a consensus algorithm. 


I'm more than confident that anyone reading this thread knows that using the blockchain for hosting is the dumbest thing ever and you're just making an ass of yourself. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:01:44


Bitcoin: shut down every node
Bitmessage: shut down every node
OpenBazaar: shut down every node which has the data you want to remove.
Why you think the "blockchain!!!!" is some kind of magical source of cesorship resistance I don't know. Further what are you going to say if the number of archival bitcoin nodes drops to like 50, or 10, or even 0? Since we are moving to a point where archival data isn't needed to validate new transactions your dropzone data is going to rely on legacy archival nodes that are not needed for consensus. Or did you not realize that's how bitcoin works? 


Again, it's a variable that can be set to whatever. You want it set to indefinite storage? You change one variable. Of course indefinite storage is patently absurd. There's no reason why old versions of listing (like when you change the price) should persist forever. That's a retarded design.

Those other applications use OP_RETURN because there is literally no other way to get consensus. There are 1000 other ways to host listing data that you could choose from yet you choose to stuff it in the blockchain and force everyone else to store it. That's the difference. 
They do it because there is no other way. 
You do it because you're lazy and bizarrely think a consensus protocol is a generic storage protocol. 
All the while you tout this as the sole source of your "censorship resistance" and why any product that doesn't shove listing data into OP_RETURN is "just a shitty web solution".
You make yourself look like a giant know nothing asshat. Keep it up.

Contrary to the other two commentators, the plan is for data to be replicated on some nodes across the network. A seller wont need to remain online for their products to remain online.

You'll find that very few people who want to increase the blocksize are in favor of huge blocks. Even Roger is open to a softfork to reduce the blocksize if it becomes clear the network is suffering from too large of a transaction load.
The problem is that there are no technical reasons not to allow modest blocksize increases consistent with what the network can handle. The push to keep it capped at 1 MB is entirely philosophical and that's where the dispute lies.

The electrum github reads:




Which, of course, is more heavyweight than just bitcoind. The whole purpose of electrum is for people to *not* run their own servers. That's why it was created ― to allow people to use bitcoin without running their own nodes. 
If I'm going to run a full node there's no incentive for me to run an indexed db on top of it just so I can use the electrum UI.

Because the only scenario where a wallet can be attacked is if an attacker has 51% of the hash power. And in that case there is more money to be made by attacking full nodes than by attacking SPV wallets.

Transaction are not infinitesimally cheap. They have a cost of a few pennies which, given the law of demand, means that only use cases which are worth more will hit the blockchain. 


The full blockchain does not need to be stored in perpetuity for bitcoin to work. There are optimizations that have been known for years which eliminate the need to store the full chain. I'm almost starting to question the motivations for not implementing such optimizations at this point. Is it only so people like you can fallaciously come on here and make this claim?

I think it depends on how SPV mining is implemented.  It could (and probably should) check all non-tx data first (like header, block size) then start mining on it, then go back and validate the transactions. If it's invalid then stop mining on top of it. 
If done like that there would be no effect of mining an invalid block.

In the non-outsourceable mining puzzles paper they describe a "jackpot" block which pays out like $10m once every 3 months. 
It got me thinking that something like could maybe decentralize mining a bit. Right now people have zero incentive to try to mine from home. 
The value proposition is "buy this $100 miner and plug it in. If you're really, really lucky you'll only lose $40 or $50."
But with a jackpot it could be "buy this $100 miner and plug it in. You're still probably going to lose $40 or $50 but you will have a shot at winning $10 million."
It's like buying a lottery ticket generator.
Of course not everyone will think that's a good deal, but if you just get a small % of the population mining at a loss like that, then it could negate the negative impact of large miners and pools.

At one point the goal of bitcoin was to create a self-contained ecosystem where people just spent bitcoin directly for what they wanted. That way there would be no need to pay the 3% for exchanging in and out of fiat. 
But you guys have more or less ruined that vision. Now bitcoin is worse than Paypal.

You had like 90% of the Chinese community opposed (not just the miners). But I guess they don't count though. 
And there was no bamboozling. 
We were told the reason we needed to support a horrible hack on a multibillion dollar protocol is because it's "safer" and less likely to cause a chain split. But that ended up being a main driver behind an actual chain split.
So we got the worse of both worlds... a chain split AND a brutally ugly protocol hack.

Having a channel open isn't the only prerequisite. The sender needs to query the recipient for a hash. If the recipient isn't online to provide that hash the funds cant move. 
Also after each hop has set up an htlc, the recipient needs to disclose the preimage to have the funds transferred across the channels. 
In OB this would require 3 parties to be online to provide the hashes to the htlc. And then after the goods are received 2 of the three parties would need to be online to disclose the preimages.
Edit: I think the last step could be done asynchronously. But I don't see how the first could be.

Read some of the comments above. Much (as of yet unreleased) work has gone into moving away from the dark market protocol design precisely because dark market required stores to be online 24/7. 
A major design objective is to remove that requirement and distribute the data around many more nodes. 
And that leads in to the discussions above because with LN you really need to be online 24/7 to accept payments. 
And on Tor. I personally spent days working on it and was the first (and I still think only) to get IPFS working over an onion transport.

I don't think they have to "spring" anything. Users do not want to pay $50 - $100 a transaction (let alone $10). At those levels even lightning is unusable (and it's still not clear it will be usable at today's fee levels) and the only remaining solution to allow people to pay each other is hosted wallets ... which is what liquid is target towards.

There's probably more attacks than this, but suppose Alice wants to buy something from Bob using Mike as a moderator and Charlie as a hop. Call this Tx1. She pulls down a list of Mike's hashes (since he's offline) and selects one at random but it turns out this was also used by some other buyer in Tx2.
Let's say Tx2 ends in a dispute and Mike reveals his hash preimage when he finishes arbitrating the dispute. Now Bob knows the preimage and can proceed to release the funds in Tx1 to himself without actually shipping the item to Alice. 
I suspect you could come up with a variety of attacks if you cannot guarantee the uniqueness of the hashes. This is just one that comes to mind.

That's not really it. The argument, which OP and the top post make no mention of, is that we don't know how well it will work in practice. 
Will routing have a more centralized or decentralized topology? Will it reliably find routes? Will any node be able to pay any other random node 100% of the time? 90% of the time? 50% of the time? Will you be able to find routes when sending anything over pocket change, say $100? Given that the vast majority of users don't run (and will not be running) their own full nodes, is it an acceptable UX to require third parties (the "watchers") just to make their wallets work? 2 of 3 escrow cannot be done without all parties online 24/7, is this an acceptable UX for consumer applications?
None of these questions have been answered and probably wont be until LN is deployed. The opposition you speak of isn't about LN per se, but being forced to used LN as basically the only way to make payments. It seems irresponsible to force people on to a system with so many unknowns.

Don't believe that? Just ask yourself how much would someone have to pay you to never use the internet again for the rest of your life. The answer is almost certainly in the millions of dollars.

The likelihood of 6 or 10 confirmations in SPV being fraudulent seems to be about the same as a 6 or 10 block reorg defrauding someone using a full node. Hardly suggests you are blindly trusting miners not to defraud you. 


Most rule changes (at least those which bump the version number) can be detected. Also worth mentioning the same economic phenomenon which causes consensus is also what discourages miners from colluding to change the rules in their favor. 


Of the three this is probably the most relevant, but nevertheless the degree of privacy offered by electrum or even bloom filtering is probably good enough for most people's coffee or beer purchases. And that doesn't preclude advances that improve on spv privacy.

That's absolutely false. A small number of payment hubs makes an easy target for regulation. It could finally allow them to impose aml/kyc on Bitcoin, track transactions, and since you must get an advance to your channel from your payment hub before you can receive a payment, it makes it easy to censor trade.
If it turns out that the number of hubs is very small, and people can't make on chain transactions because of cost,  it will prove to be pretty disastrous for Bitcoin.

You do realize that, unlike the Bitcoin network, in order to receive a tx in LN you must convince a payment hub to deposit money in a channel with you. 
What company investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in their payment hub is going to want to deposit money into a channel with, say, wikileaks? Or any number of other people or groups that are viewed negatively? This much more conducive to censorship that Bitcoin is currently.

I see this meme being used more and more ... That spv is inherently insecure and that you are trusting other people not to defraud you. Either I'm totally missing something or people pushing this meme are being extremely dishonest.
As I replied on the mailing list... The situation he refers to consists of an attacker Sybil attacking an spv client and feeding it fake headers in an attempt to defraud it. Since the spv client isn't validating the blocks, it won't know the headers are invalid. 
But any attacker that has enough hashing power to create a chain of 6 or 10 headers to defraud an spv client, also has enough hashing power to create 6 or 10 valid blocks and defraud a full node (this is also neglecting to mention that the probability of either attack is negligible)
I fail to see how the spv client is more vulnerable than a full node to an attacker with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. Am I missing something or is this meme just attempt to be manipulative and influence the blocksize debate?

When people visit a store we cache the store date -- listings, images, contracts, profile -- on their node so we don't have to re-download it the next time they visit that store. 
But since they already have that data on their node, we can put a pointer in the dht so that other people can download it from them if the store goes offline.
That's not going to be in 1.0 because we have a lot on our plate, but it will be easy to implement after that since the data is already cached.

Thank you for the response. You make two good points: attacking a full node requires you to at least own the coins and you could attack multiple spv wallets at once. 
How much more insecure does that make an spv wallet in practice?  To the first point, I would expect the amount of coins an attacker would be spoofing in an spv attack could be trivially acquired if attacking a full node for the same amount (especially by someone who presumably has millions worth of hashing power). 
For number two, you would need to be simultaneously conducting transactions with thousands of people all at once which doesn't seem plausible. 
In either case those seem like edge cases that hardly justify blowing up spv wallets.

More clarification for people reading this post. The above isn't really true. The store name will be a string that you enter. It can be whatever you want. Below the store name will be either a 20 byte store ID or, if you want, a short handle that maps to the store ID. 
Take a look at any twitter profile and you'll see what I mean. There is a user-configurable string for the 'name' and below the  It will be the same thing.


The store ID/handle is only used in those situations where a user wants to navigate directly to a store. But that isn't the only way to find a store. There is a store directory, keyword searches, categories, and a favorites list.


The protocol is decentralized, like all other identity protocols in existence it requires you to run a full node if you want to fully verify the query. You can do this with onename. They have an opensource resolver. And we will given people the option to link the OpenBazaar client to their own resolver if they feel the necessity. For everyone else, we will just use the API. Yes, the api is trusted, but so would be querying a namecoin block explorer. The future of the decentralized identity space is going to be around making trustless lightweight queries and I'd expect onename to be a leader in that since they have funding and no one else does. When that happens we will stop using the api and move to the trustless version. 
(Note, getting funding for a project shouldn't be a derogatory thing. It means you can work on the code full time rather than rely on part time people who treat it as a hobby.)

IMO the problem was in how they implemented it not necessarily the idea. There would be no problem if they were to:
* Validate the header
* Start mining on the header
* Validate the block
* Revert to mining on the previous block if the block is invalid.
The fiasco a couple months ago happened because pools were too lazy/incompetent to do even step one, let alone steps three and four.
If they did they above, they would receive the benefit of spv mining without creating major reorgs and losing money.

I don't really think it's insecure (that I know of) but it is definitely a heavy weight protocol.

It's different predictions about what will happen when the blocksize increases or doesn't increase.
Some believe if the blocksize increases the cost to run a node will become so high that the number of nodes/miners will fall to a level that is dangerous for decentralization. They also believe that transactions can be done off chain and not all need to use the blockchain. This group typically wants higher fees to compensate for the reduction in the block subsidy and sees a cap on blocksize as a way to enforce an economic policy.
Additionally they tend to think that average users should be running full nodes (or at least have the option) which will become more difficult if the blocksize increases.
On the other hand you have people who have a less pessimistic view of what will happen to the number of nodes when the blocksize increases. They tend to think hardware improvements and increased adoption can make up for any loss due to increased storage/bandwidth/cpu requirements. And they tend to have less of a problem with a network where nodes are run on servers and average people use lightweight wallets.
They also tend to be skeptical that the off-chain solutions can work as well as the blockchain and view it as too risky to force people to adopt new technologies before having any chance to see how they perform in the real world. 
Finally they tend to place an emphasis on adoption and believe that higher fees will discourage adoption and stunt bitcoin's growth.

I don't know why this meme keeps coming up. You will be able to register/run a store without a onename. It's only used to shorten the id so you can go directly to a store by entering  instead of 9475590302a21db44fadd6bd07426666ee77b276.
And entering id isn't the only way to reach a store. There's also keyword searches and sorting through a list of stores.

The number is somewhat arbitrary. Whatever it is (for both bitcoin and LN) it should be easy enough for anyone to run a node/hub at any time making it next to impossible to regulate. 
If it takes millions of dollars in capital to run a payment hub, and we can't use the blockchain for payments because it's too expensive, you can just see the regulators licking their lips. 
Aside from the threat of regulation (or collusion between operators of course), I really don't care what the number is as long as it remains free from interference.

You could open up the client and the first images that load on the home page are like scat porn or something worse.
And you know someone will host that content just to troll the network.
I'm personally in favor of curating the items that show on the homepage. That wouldn't be censoring the scat porn store, just would mean looking at it becomes optional. 
(as a side effect a curated home page could bring ad revenue that keeps ob1 in business but that decision is beyond me).

What would competition matter? Results can be sorted by price, by rating, randomly, alphabetically. 
My only concern is people tagging their products with keywords that aren't relevant to increase their visibility. We will limit the number of tags you can use per product to limit that and hopefully ratings will take care of the rest.

Firstly, the ID isn't going to take the place of a customizable store name in the UI. You're not going to go to a store and see 


Instead you will see whatever name the store wants to put there. The ID will be visible somewhere on the store page, but it's only to verify the identity of the store you connect to so you don't end up buying from an impostor (and note that ratings and escrow/arbitration will also mitigate that threat). The onename part only maps the ID to a more memorable handle (with some level of trust placed on onename atm). I don't think it will be a deal breaker for a store if they don't have one. 
Secondly, ob1 hasn't been paid to use onename nor has USV told us to use it. 
If there is something comparable that doesn't require users to download a full blockchain (like namecoin) or purchase a domain name or certificate we would consider it. It's just there isn't a whole lot of options.

The assumption is most miners will use the fast relay network or iblt will get merged.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:40:45
OK I'm still not understanding then. In both cases, whether a reorg or lying about the utxo set, the attacker needs to build a chain that is at least long enough to cover how ever many confirmations the victim is waiting for. (And he needs to somehow do this fast enough that the victim doesn't get suspicious, i.e. it's taking 10 hours for 6 confirmations). 


I don't get what you mean by that. Could you not do the same with a full node at any % hash power (again as long as you can some how do it fast enough to not raise suspicion)?
I see the difference between lying about the utxo set vs doing a reorg, but my original point was both cases take the same amount of hashing power (though in the spv case the attacker need not own the coins first). 
@_date: 2015-08-21 12:05:34
Most pools are using the fast relay network which has mostly mitigated that problem for now.

The point is they aren't moving away from it for the reasons we are told why it's inevitable (to collect higher fees in exchange for helping to defraud people). It's almost like since that prediction hasn't come true people are just going to do it anyway out of ideology and to prove they were right all along. 
Which is why the while full rbf is so frustrating. The need has not arisen organically like predicted. It's only come about because of a basically a PR campaign from its supporters.
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:53:21
Here we go again. This comes up almost every other day now and we've repeatedly said that using onename will be optional. It's only there to map the 20 byte hash to something more memorable. 
If you don't use onename, you're not not going to be foregoing a human readable store name for 20 random bytes. The store name will still be a string entered by you and can say whatever you want regardless of whether you use onename or not. 
Why onename? It isn't perfect, but at present there isn't anything else that lets you do lightweight queries. Downloading/verifying the full namecoin blockchain to do name resolution is not an option for openbazaar. Neither is purchasing a domain name as some other schemes require.
If you want to see us use namecoin submit some pull requests to namecoin to add committed utxo to the protocol so we don't need to download the full chain. Or go create a sidechain to do it. 
I see a lot of complaints about onename (who are actively working on improving the space) without offering any usable solutions.

*Wait for confirmations* - That's fine for many online stores, but will never be used by physical retail stores (which is where we do most of our shopping). 
*GreenAddress-like trust relations* - totally destroys your privacy and would likely end up in same situation as we have with CAs where 4 CAs have 90% market share. 
*RBF-Scorched-Earth* - Will never be used. Period. Merchants will abandon bitcoin before using something as convoluted as that. Neither will consumers want to have to over-pay for everything they buy and wait to get a refund later.
*Lightning-like networks or payments channels* - The only one that has a chance of working, but it all depends on how the economics shake out (which we wont know until we see it). If it turns out there are only a few payment hubs and the network resembles Visa, MC, and Amex is it worth it? Also it might end up having green-address-like privacy problems. 
Why people have to encourage pools to help defraud merchants by not using the first-seen policy is beyond me. If not for them doing so, something like Eric said about risk management policy would work well in most cases.

I still tend to think this is going to be much more difficult to implement than expected. 
Imagine the following scenario: 
Alice wants to send $1000 dollars in Bitcoin to Bob. 
After some communication and setup Bob pulls $1000 in Bitcoin from his payment hub to himself. 
The payment hub then pulls $1000 from Alice (or another hub if this is a mutli-hop scenario) to reimburse itself. 
For this to work off-chain, Bob's hub needed to have $1000 worth of Bitcoin on hand *previously* *deposited* *into* *the* *channel* *it* *has* *with* *Bob* . If it doesn't have that amount already in Bob's channel, then the tx cannot be completed off chain. 
This not only means the hub needs to have a ton of capital on hand to facilitate trade of all its customers -- which makes us wonder how many hubs can we reasonably expect the network to have -- but it also has the incredibly difficult task of calculating the "optimal" amount of bitcoins to keep in each channel. Too many and it's unnecessarily tying up its own money (which represents a loss in terms of opportunity cost). Too little and it will frequently fail to enable off-chain txs and will likely have to eat tx fees as a result. 
So what will need to happen is the hub will need to design an algorithm that will track all your transactions and learn your spending habits. For example, it might want to know how much your paycheck is and when your payday is, how frequently you spend from your wallet, what percentage of your income do you save, etc. All in an attempt to better allocate it's capital between channels. 
Not saying that can't work, but it seems a bit like a privacy nightmare and a lot less straight forward than the technical jargon makes it seem. 
(Note I only skimmed Rusty's paper but didn't see anything that changed the dynamic of hubs having to payout the recipient first then reimburse themselves after).
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:14:56


The thing is, the people who have adopted policies other than first seen haven't done so because of a desire to get paid more (the fees from it are currently close to zero), or out of some attempt to maliciously defraud people.... they've only done so because some devs have told them they might as well because it's inevitable *someone* *else* will do so.  But that inevitability has not come about and people have adopted other policies almost exclusively because of cheerleading for it.

You don't really need to fork it.
Just build a Tor plugin for it using onion cat. Unfortunately, that means the Tor network will be separated from the rest of the network, but it's probably better that way.
The more difficult challenge is making it so vendors don't need to remain online all the time to host their store (which is much more risky than using a centralized marketplace). I have a plan for that using caching/seeding like bittorrent, but it isn't going to be in the first version.

We can read about all the technical properties of it, but we can't read about it's economic properties. We have to wait to see it exist. 
It's certainly a possibility that the economics are such that the only way to get a viable route of your payment is to use one of only a handful of large scale hubs. Making it a quasi centralized payment layer. 
The probability of that happening is greater than the possibility of the sun not rising tomorrow, to say the least.

I think the causation runs in reverse.  Government intervention has been causing consolidation in banking going as far back as the Lincoln administration.

We got a perfect example from a Harvard study just this week:

Why? How does the decision of a company to accept zeroconf txs affect you at all? The opposite is true as you would have less places to spend your coins and likely coins that are worth less as the utility has decreased.


It's appropriate to forecast based on past experience and how we know rational economic actors behave. The only reason to change would be if some fundamentals in the real world have changed.

If this is an argument against the proposals by larger block advocates I'm not sure how relevant that number is. I could be wrong but I assume the reason it was an 88% savings and not 50%, say, is because blocks are full and more txs are being made than will fit in blocks. 
In an environment where blocks have enough capacity for all relayed txs I would think that number would be closer to 50% (though of course absolute bandwidth would be higher, the relative savings would probably be much more than 12%)..

YES! We know the lightening network works from a technical perspective. We do not know if it works from an economic one simply because it does not exist. 
How many payment hubs will there be? What will be the cost of running a payment hub? Will the network be decentralized or more resemble visa, mc, amex?

I wrote a (somewhat critical) blog post on Lightning [here]( 
It does provide a good explanation of how it's supposed to work, however.
Segregated Witness is being pushed, not so much to increase transaction capacity, but because it fixes a couple things that are needed to produce the most efficient form of the lightning network. The fact that it allows for slightly larger transaction capacity is a side effect but the purpose. 
Very few people are against either Segwit or Lightning (although doing changes as comprehensive as segwit as a softfork are questionable). But the reason for the controversy is they are being pitched as an alternative to increasing the block size. Even more so when no working implementations exists to allow people to see if it works well.

We would definitely get a better idea of what the LN would look like. Will there be thousands of payment hubs making it a truly decentralized payment network? Great then we probably don't need to let the blocksize keep growing. 
Will it cost so much to run a payment hub that the only companies that can afford to do it are coinbase, bitpay, and maybe blockstream? Well then the LN sucks and I'd rather keep my txs on chain.
The fact that we don't know which it is (and can't know until we see it) is why some people aren't throwing all in for the LN and arguing that the blocksize should be increased in the interim.

I think those "longer, less efficient routes" likey wont exist at all or will be rare when they are found. It's one thing to find a path six-degrees-of-separation style, but it's another to find those paths when each hop needs to have the correct value on their side of the channel.

Why? 99% of bitcoin users will not do this even if they can. Everyone can run a mail server (which uses substantially less resources) but 99.999999% of people don't. Why does the average person need to run one? For most people their largest incoming payment is from their employer. Are they at risk of their employer acquiring enough hashing power to double spend against their SPV wallet?


This is a recipe for bitcoin having a price of precisely zero. It very much shows ignorance to the economics of both gold and bitcoin. Gold's utility is derived from two things:
1) Use in electronics, chemistry, jewelry/ornamentation etc.
2) People speculating that in the event of an economic meltdown gold will play a larger roll in the money supply. Either from people trading for it directly, central banks acquiring it in their reserves, etc.
Bitcoin's does not have  Therefore 100% of it's current value is derived from investors speculating that it will be demanded in exchange in the future. If bitcoin does not become actively traded for goods and services (or the various 2.0 uses ― colored coins, etc) then it's value will drop to near zero as the anticipated demand will not have materialized. Ironically your call for it to be an asset that just sits there and holds value is precisely what will cause the value to tank. 


That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that, except it will still likely be inferior in terms of decentralization/censorship resistance than just making an on-chain transaction. Assuming fees stay around $0.05 - $5.00 then people can make an on-chain if they need to (like making a donation to wikileaks). But if fees start pricing people out of making on-chain txs you're actively harming people who need to use the p2p network to avoid routing payments through centralized institutions.

Sorry man but that statement is horrifically economically illiterate.
Assets don't generate demand for "savings" all by themselves. They derive their demand from the utility they offer. 
As I said above, most of gold's value comes from industrial use cases (which Bitcoin does not have). The remainder comes from speculators who are betting that gold will acquire monetary utility in the event of an economic meltdown.
Bitcoin's value comes exclusively from expected demand in exchange. If that demand doesn't materialize, the price will collapse.

As has been pointed out number times the network can necessarily handle the block sizes we are likely to see over the next five years (or more) with no decenerable impact on dectralization. 
Nobody is arguing that the network can handle VISA volume today, but people are arguing that it can handle today's volume. And it might be able to handle the entire demand for on chain txs depending on the rate of growth of that demand relative to the rate of growth of bandwidth, CPU, storage etc. 
That's especially likely if technologies like LN take a significant portion of that demand off chain.

I don't think right now it's practical either, at least for everyone to do that. Bitcoin can't handle all transactions today, but it can handle today's level on transactions ― which it's being prevented from doing. And it's being prevented from growing to accommodate more transactions as technological progress makes room for more. 
And I'm not trying to come across as hostile to LN. I like Joseph and roasbeef a lot. My problem isn't with them. It's that it's been pushed as a complete substitute for current functionality, when 1) It's not even built yet, and 2) We have no practice experience with it (and thin amounts of research). The result has been a over a year of stagnation for bitcoin. No new major merchants have adopted it. In fact I think we've had more merchants give up on it than started taking it. The momentum bitcoin had is totally gone. And it's bleeding users to various altcoins that aren't turning away users and don't have a toxic development environment.

I think you're reading more into that than needs be the case. Decentralized reputation is still an open research area in academia and we certainly don't have any magic answers. The rating system that is currently in place is partially gameable and users should be aware of that before relying too much on it. It should probably need to be used with some combination of web of trust. 
But what was said up there was that it may be possible to detect a malicious vendor pumping up his own ratings by cycling the same coins through his transactions. 
In fact, I'm not even sure that would be possible in the 2.0 because I'm changing the rating scheme to remove the bitcoin address from it. Which, btw, wasn't in there to deanonymize people but because it was more about proof a transaction took place. But I've found another way to do the same thing.

This is going to put me on fucking tilt. What the fuck is the point of bitcoin then? Why dont you just buy gold bullion and stop fucking up bitcoin? 
Gold has failed to provide any meaningful competition to central banks precisely because government's find it easy to censor gold PAYMENTS. 
The promise of bitcoin was to undermine that ability then shit lords like yourself came along and decided to turn it just anthother type of gold.  
And as far as layer 2 goes. I wouldnt hold my breath. Nobody even knows if the fucking thing will work because you've wasted everyone's time for the last two years without even doing any modeling to see if it will work. 
And since nobody else has bothered I've spent the last several days writing python scripts to model the likelihood that payments will find routes when values are taken into consideration.  
Preliminary results seem to confirm my suspicion that a non-negligible number of transactions will fail to find routes. At least at medium and high values. 
And it also seems to suggest that route failure increases as the network scales as it becomes uneconomical to increase the number of channels per node at the same rate of network growth.

between two given nodes), so it is very possible (probable?) that a route
is not actually usable because the channels are not balanced.

I'm under the impression that bitcoinj has the ability (I think it's the default though not sure) to wait for a threshold of peers to relay an unconfirmed transaction before pushing it to the UI. 
Not only that but the wallet only makes outgoing connections to random peers. The combination of which means the screen cap he's showing is extremely unlikely to happen even if you don't wait for the confirms (and it can't happen if you do).
You get that screen cap by connecting bitcoinj to a "trusted peer" which, since your are trusting it, bitcoinj disables the risk analysis. Hardly evidence of it being trivial to attack.

As later stated (fallaciously) by apologists for monetary central planning and not by Gresham himself nor many theorists from 15th century through the classical era. 
Gresham's law deals with the government's attempt to fix the price of money (coins back then) which ended up driving the good money (without the price controls) out of the market. It was never intended to imply that there is something peculiar about good money that it ends up disappearing from an economy. Rather the opposite is true ― good money out-competes inferiority money when the market is unregulated and no price controls are present.

When fees regularly go over $1 and have spiked as high as $5 I think you'll find many people wouldn't agree with this statement. 
But furthermore. Segwit2x was an attempt to end the gridlock and keep the community united. Segwit obviously wasn't going anywhere. After six months it had a whopping 25% miner support and it needed 95% (And no it wasn't just evil Chinese miners blocking it. Many people like myself thought it was too much of a hack for a multi-billion dollar protocol). 
The idea was to *compromise*. That means both sides agree to give up something they don't want in exchange for something they do want. Nearly everyone found this to be an acceptable tradeoff keeping the community together and moving forward. 
But now that segwit is active the sentiment in this sub (which is a clear minority of the community) is basically "fuck you! we got what we want fuck you and your compromise". 
It's really a disgusting mentality. I personally only supported segwit as a *compromise* and would not have supported it in any other context.

Ah the old Marxist labor theory of value... that someone expended energy to create something means that it will automatically have value by virtue of the effort. 
Looks like you have absolutely no clue how markets work.
There have literally been quadrillions of lines of code written by failed projects that consumers never adopted. Some of which have actually been superior technically but the user experience is not what people wanted. 
What people are saying is it makes no sense to deprecate something people have already demonstrated a preference for, in favor of some theoretical solution that nobody knows if it will work or anyone will even want. Especially when there is nearly universal agreement that conservative capacity increase have no negative side effects and cause no additional centralization pressure.

I mean amount of economic activity that passes through full nodes. For example, if exchanges didn't do full validation the miners might be tempted to try to form a 51% cartel and increase the inflation rate because the exchanges wouldn't notice. 
Likewise the exchanges might be tempted to not run a full node if none of their customers were running one because even if miners slipped them invalid coins, no one would notice when they turned around sent those coins to someone else. 
So at the end of the day running a full node *and* accepting payments with it creates an incentive for others to do so and when enough people do this it serves as a disincentive for miners to form a 51% cartel (since nobody would accept their payments). 
This is why I say just running a node for the sake of running one doesn't do anything to contribute to this incentive structure. Likewise even if you do accept incoming payments, but the total value of those payments is so tiny that it's an insignificant part of the total bitcoin economy... then you're contribution to this incentive structure is also negligible. 
It's possible a single insignificant node, when combined with a bunch of other insignificant nodes, might add up to a significant % of the economic activity. But then again maybe it wont. 
But really what matters is having some kind of non-zero % of economic activity flowing through fully validating nodes so as to disincentive miners from doing anything malicious.
But that's the only context in which full nodes matter. The absolute number of nodes is relatively meaningless.

This is something I've been telling people. Using a hosted bitcoin wallet does not make your coins any more secure than storing them directly on your device. 
Coinbase can have impeccable security practices to prevent them from losing your coins, but the same attacks that can steal the coins off your computer can access your coinbase account and drain your wallet.

You don't need a quantum computer to do signature validation and mining. It could be done on a regular computer. There are a number of post-quantum signature schemes that run on conventional computers. The signatures aren't as nicely compact as ecdsa and would bloat the block chain a bit, but it would work.
It would take time to transition bitcoin to a new signature algorithm, but people could use different addresses for each tx (which they should be doing anyway) and just send txs directly to pools rather than a normal broadcast during the transition.

It has nothing to do with historical inertia. Economists can very easily explain the demand for gold.
1) Gold has demand because it's useful in chemistry, electronics, jewelry, ornamentation etc.
2) Speculators are speculating that the demand for  will increase in the future and/or gold will find new use cases (such as sitting in central bank reserves or a barter asset in total economic meltdown mode).
Bitcoin by itself really does not have any use cases which generate demand (except maybe very tiny demand for timestamping or colored coin stuff). Therefore without  it's not going to have  
The only thing that can cause bitcoin to have any value at all (let alone be a "store" of value), is people either demanding it in exchange (using it for money) or demanding it for those various timestamping/colored coin usages.

I think this does a good job of explaining why nearly all politicians are corrupt and why corruption is a prerequisite for rule. 
He leaves out some critical parts however. There is simply not enough resources to go around to buy support from a large majority or super majority of the population. To acquire that support, the ruling class usually resorts to extreme amounts of propaganda to get the masses to believe that they would be much worse off without them in power.
We see this in the video. He says politicians in a democracy spend money schools and hospitals and roads because they want the citizens to be productive so as to increase the tax base. 
However, if that were really the end goal then they would completely abstain from intervening in schools, hospitals and roads and let competing private enterprises do their thing to build better schools, hospitals, and roads at a lower cost which would result in a better educated, healthier population.
The reason they run the schools, hospitals, and roads is purely a form of propaganda. They want people to believe that only the *government* can provide these things and without the overloads in power, people would be stupid, sick, and driving on dirt roads. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:25:32
Ok there's a couple problems with the above. 
1) There is zero (repeat ZERO) reason for the government to attempt to provide any service. It lacks profit motives, knowledge of dispersed information, a profit-loss feedback mechanism, and a fear of loss. The result is in each and every circumstance the quality of the service provided by the government will be inferior to that provided by firms who compete for voluntary payment. What you do when you have the government run a service is you turn it into that industry's equivalent of the DMV. It's absolutely immoral. 
2) In the extremely unlikely scenario that some people *still* cannot afford a necessary product despite market competition, innovation, and entrepreneurship driving costs to a bare minimum, all that is needed is to write those people a check for them to spend themselves. Typically this is done by charities and my suspicion is that charity would have more than enough funds for the purpose. But if you decide that, for some reason, charity isn't enough, and government needs to "do something".... for God sakes just cut them a check and don't turn the hospitals, schools, and everything else into the DMV.

I don't really think this is the case. Even in poor countries people are able to find work and sustain themselves. There is a problem with the unemployment rate being several points higher than it should be, and there are causes for that, but it doesn't imply that the typical human experience is to struggle for subsistence as you seem to be implying. It's actual extremely rare in western countries.


We'll we know who to blame for that right? Only about 3% of the land mass of the united states is developed, but the government will throw you in jail if you try to homestead any part of the remaining 97%. What do you think that does to the opportunities people have or their cost of living?


Of course that is 100% false empirically. Wages rose dramatically and working conditions improved during the industrial revolution when there were no labor regulations at all. 
People like to point to that period as evidence of businesses exploiting people, but the data tells a different story. People started out extremely poor... and became less poor as the economy grew. 
And that isn't just some anomalous outcome, every economist would predict the same thing as the result of competitive labor markets. Eventually we get to the point where we are today where the poor have access to amenities that were not available to the likes of Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt.

"Digital Gold" is a recipe for Bitcoin becoming worthless. It's sad that this is the driving motivation many people opposing the block size.

Bitcoin doesn't have 1, and the "digital gold" people don't want it to be used as a medium of exchange either.

The percentage of demand of an asset from industrial usage vs speculation is largely irrelevant to the underlying economic phenomenon. 
The claim often made in this sub is something along the lines of "Bitcoin can have a demand because people will acquire it for savings purposes. People will acquire it for savings purposes because they expect other people, in the future, to also acquire it for savings. And those people will acquire it expecting further other people to save it in the future. And so on."
^ That is the fallacy. Value doesn't work like that. And often people point to Gold as an example of an asset that does work like that and I'm saying, no... gold speculation, no matter how much is taking place, is predicated on the belief that gold will find more *use* in the future (likely some kind of monetary usage if/when the dollar collapses).
Thus bitcoin *could* theoretically behave like gold in that speculation about future *use* could drive up its price. But this also implies that bitcoin, as a technology, must be capable of handling that usage. 
People in this sub who espouse the above fallacy, deny that bitcoin needs to be capable of handling that future *use* and want to think it can simply exist with "people saving it because they expect other people to save it". 
Of course such a view isn't consistent with economics.

And what makes entry to the market difficult? Barriers to entry (at least in a free market) are not actual barriers at all. They are mere hurdles. And they are hurdles that the every firm (including the first mover) had to leap over to get in. The only type of *barriers* that actually exists are the ones created by government. This is precisely why certain sectors (like healthcare) are so dysfunctional. When the government literally goes around shutting down half of the nations media schools at the behest of a doctor guild, what do you think that does to competition and hence prices? (that's one example of a government created barrier among thousands)


Of course, it doesn't work like this at all in reality. The choice of an arbitration firm is part of the contract people agree to when they do business with the company. It's part of the bundle of goods/services offered. If people don't like the choice of arbitrator, they don't sign the contract. Firms that pick biased arbitrators will find nobody wants to enter into contracts with them.
Btw, as a lead developer for OpenBazaar I can testify this is *exactly* how it works. Nobody would buy anything on OpenBazaar if vendors only selected arbitrators who would side with them. The choice of the arbitrator is part of the bundle of goods offered by vendors and they have to pick ones they think buyers will find fair else they wont have any sales.

Again, just no. No knowledgeable investor would drop any money on an asset on the premise that people will want to save it in the future. 
 &gt; This is how any bubble works, and money is just a bubble that doesn't pop. 
No it isn't. Money, is demanded as a medium of exchange. That is, one needs to acquire it first before one can trade with it. 
Historically, assets like gold only had demand from their industrial usage. Once people started using them as a medium of exchange... the demand of those desiring to use it as a medium of exchange was *added* to the industrial use demand.
Money is not "a bubble that doesn't pop". It's value is perfectly consistent with it's demand as a medium of exchange. 
Likewise people who invest in bitcoin do so expecting that bitcoin is going to have use cases in the future for which it is demanded. Mostly likely investors are expecting it to facilitate exchange in some fashion or another if not have other use cases. 
But no otherwise worthless asset in the history of the world ever became demanded because someone expected other people to want to save the worthless asset in the future.

You guys just keep throwing up one fallacy after another.


Nobody uses gold as money. It is not used as a medium exchange, let alone a universally accepted medium of exchange. It was a monetary good in the past, but is no longer. 


Hence, like gold, most of bitcoin's demand is derived from speculation about future demand derived from usages. 


But that will only happen if, in the future, the gold, or bitcoin, has enough demand stemming from people using it. If it doesn't, and if speculators *at* *that* *time* don't expect future demand derived from future usage to increase, then the asset will not hold it's value. 
Again, I will repeat. People save assets because they are demanded (and expect increased demand or reduced supply in the future). People don't demand assets because they are saved.

You don't have to do it like that. Peter said replacing only specific outputs was considered (which would be FSS) but you couldn't do it because there is no extra data fields available in the output to mark the output as replaceable. 
You could have used the same scheme as sighash_single. If the nSequence value on input 0 is &lt; maxint -1 then output 0 is replaceable. 
That does replace-by-fee with no more extra overhead but preserves FSS for outputs paying merchants. 
Transactions could set the the nSequence on input 0 &lt; maxint -1 and put the change in output 0. Then when you want to bump the fee you just reduces the value of output 0 but you can't change who output 1 pays. 
Seems patch was rushed through without enough discussion.

Greg take a look at what I posted above. You could have written it so that "If input x has nSequence &lt; maxint -1 then output x is replaceable". That is FSS and does not require any additional inputs and also preserves the ability to add additional outputs and do all the other things you mentioned. 
My complaint is not about concept of opt-in RBF, I would have been happy with the above scheme. But about the general concept you elucidated of miners replacing transactions even if the new tx sends the coins to a different address. It's not necessary to do so (given the scheme above) and I don't see any use case for that other than to aid in fraud.

But it is opt-in only. And seems like a small price for preserving FSS outputs.

Replace by fee cannot work without it. Merchants will not adopt a system in which people can maliciously burn the value of the tx after they walk out the door.

That's basically how it works. The vendor selects the arbitrator and almost universally the vendors try to pick honest, fair, and neutral arbitrators because they know that's what buyer's want. The vendor has no reason to pick anything other than a non-biased arbitrator as only that will maximize sales. 
In otherwords, the profit maximizing behavior *is* the exact behavior that maximizes benefits to the consumer. I think any attempt to suggest otherwise is ideological spin and not reality.

You have to remember Tor isn't a magic bullet for Bitcoin privacy. While the electrum server won't learn the IP address that goes with the list of transactions, just having possession of a pseudonymous list of someone's transactions can be detrimental to your privacy.
Everytime you make a transaction the other party knows which address the coins were sent from/to and almost always knows your real world identity.
So you end up with a pseudonymous list of your transactions in the possession of some random person on the internet and your actuality identify in the hands of everyone your transacted with. If those two pieces of information are brought together then your entering transaction history can be deanonymized. 
Note that Tor would not help you here. In my opinion the solution is to send txs directly to the recipient so they can broadcast it/do a one off query for block inclusion. This way we aren't giving a list of our addresses to someone else.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:10:21
Well testing transactions against the bloom filter is done by the remote peer using the filter matching algorithm in bip37. 
The python-bitcoinlib library has code to test a single data element against the filter 
When a new block comes over the wire, the remote peer tests each tx in the block against our filter and then sends us a MerkleBlock message which contains some hashes that we can use to link transactions to the merkle root. 
I have code to test those hashes against the Merkle root here:

Zero conf txs are trivial to double spend but also have always been largely detectable. With the exception of a finny attack (which is described above), the first-seen miner policy means that any point-of-sale terminal that detects double spends and is knowledgeable about differing mem pool policies (eg. Eligius) can mostly mitigate the threat and reduce the fraud rate to a manageable level. 
Replacing first-seen with RBF means that people can walk out of a store with merchandise, push a button on their phone, and defraud the merchant (with the aid of the miner) making double spend detection impossible, preventing bitcoin form being used in retail stores in the process. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 19:26:17
That is true but RBF still reduces the utility of Bitcoin and aids in fruad. It's unclear to me if it would be in a miner's long term interest even in an environment where fees make up a large portion of revenue.
At minimum it implies we have to wait for the data to come in before we can conduct a proper economic analysis. And it's pretty reckless to adopt a major economic change without performing such an analysis.

That doesn't imply that gold has demand because people are expecting other people to save it in the future (which seems to be what you are suggesting). 
That is the precisely fallacy I mentioned above. All it implies is that current speculators expect a massive increase in usage in the future. Which could plausibly happen if the bottom drops out of the economy and gold takes on some monetary usages. 
But if those usages don't materialize, at some point speculators will lose money. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 04:38:15


If everyone thought like this the value of Bitcoin would go to zero. It is not gold. Gold has an industrial use value that sets a floor on it's price. The price is bid up above that floor by people speculating that, at some point in the future, gold might play a larger monetary role. If never materializes, the price will drop down to its industrial use value. (This is mostly what's happened to gold post 2011 when it became obvious the monetary use cases weren't happening).
Bitcoin behaves the same way, except with no industrial usage setting a floor. The floor for Bitcoin is zero. The only reason the price isn't zero today is because, like gold, people are speculating it will play a larger monetary role in the future.... which means it will be demanded in exchange. If that demand doesn't materialize, expect a major crash. 
Which is why the "Bitcoin just needs to be an asset that you sit on like gold" mentality is idiotic.
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:02:32
That was the point of double spend relaying, to make it trivial to detect that so you didn't need to connect to tons of peers. But they rejected that because it would 'encourage people to rely on zero conf txs'.

This exactly. Pure propaganda. The fact is the mem pool difference that have allowed double spending in the past could have been (and mostly are) accounted for with carefully written code since miners were still using first-seen as the base policy. 
Only by changing the base policy to RBF does zero conf txs become 100% insecure.

@_date: 2015-11-28 18:12:41
The point is that up to this point almost all miners have used the first-seen policy. It doesn't matter that nodes may see txs in a different order. All that is (was) required for a merchant to take zero conf txs was to have the pos terminal flag a tx when two conflicting txs were detected. Order doesn't matter. 
It's only miners adopting RBF in place of first-seen that poses a threat to merchants because detecting a double spend after the customer walks out the store doesn't help you.
Peter Todd's argument (and yours as well) has been that rational miners will choose RBF over first-seen because it maximizes profits. Yet a number of people have questioned the validity of this logic because:
1) It focuses only on profits in the short run (one-time game) rather than on what policy maximizes profits over the long run (repeating game).
2) Miners have not voluntarily adopted RBF even though they have had six years to do so. When the empirical evidence does not match the theory, the theory is probably wrong. And given  it almost certainly is.
So we are left with this push to implement a policy that will clearly reduce the utility of Bitcoin based on a (very likely) bogus economic analysis.

I believe the wallet uses UPnP which should allow you to take incoming connections. Although it doesn't always work.

I watched this whole thing and came away unimpressed. The whole thing sounded like an "I'm smarter than everyone else because I know X", when in reality he's mostly wrong. 


Mostly false. If banks lend out to the maximum and keep the minimum required reserves... that's the maximum the money supply can grow to. It's true the fed can increase reserves and subsequently increase bank lending, but that implies the decider of the size of the money supply is the central bank, not the commercial banks. The opposite of what the video suggests. 
You could say, "Well some types of accounts don't have reserve requirements". Yes, but that doesn't mean a bank can engage in infinite lending. They would go bust if they tried it. Absent a government defined reserve requirement, banks will self impose one consistent with their tolerance for risk.


Again, no. From the entire history of modern banking until 2008, banks lent out all of their excess reserves (excess the government imposed reserve requirement). Look at the Fred chart.. 
Excess reserves were flat lined at zero until 2008. That implies that the money supply was totally controlled by central banks, not commercial banks. And that makes sense, why would you hold cash and take a negative ROI if you don't have to? In 2008 there was a massive policy change which accounts for the deviation from the norm. 
You only can say "Total money depends on the confidence of banks", if you look at 2008 and after... again after a massive policy change to shift incentives. 
Anyways I tend to think the entire operation of the banking and monetary system is screwed up and functions nothing like it would in a genuine free market.

PSA for those who think Tor is a magic bullet for bitcoin: 
At this point in time there are no lightweight wallets that can guarantee privacy protection against the type of data collection chainanalysis is engaged in. 
Your wallet can still be deanonymized even if you use Tor. Every tx you make maps your real world identity to an address and it's very likely a list of your addresses could end up in the hands chainanalysis or someone similar. 
Using a server based wallet like Electrum/Mycelium can help you to the extent that you trust the server not to be compromised or comply with subpoenas, etc, but you will not get the same amount of privacy you would by running your own full node. 
Making lightweight wallets as private as a full node requires technical solutions that go beyond just using Tor.

The point I'm making is you don't have the same privacy guarantees as you do with a full node. 
You have random people out there on the internet (who you really don't know or have any particular reason to trust) in possession of data that can deanonymize your entire transaction history. You simply don't have that with a full node.
Making lightweight wallets as private and trustless as full nodes is hard and requires technical solutions (I've spent the last year or longer working on this). But until those solutions become widely adopted, I don't think it's appropriate to tell people 'just use Electrum and Tor and you'll be fine'.

Seems like this might suffer from similar privacy problems? (Unless I'm just misunderstanding). 
If I'm trying to sync my wallet from seed:

2) The remote peer scans the BFD until it finds a match, returns the block and stops. 
3) I check the block and find addr 0, now I need to find out when it was spent. So I update the filter with either the pubkey or outpoint. 
The remote peer now knows that the block contained my tx and which one it is specifically. Same for every other tx in my wallet. Am I wrong?

You would censor an OpenBazaar node the same way you would a Bitcoin node, DoS, Sybil attacks, taking over your internet connection, etc. 
It's true with Bitcoin someone cannot take your coins, but if they went through the trouble it would take to prevent you from connecting to the OpenBazaar network to prevent you from connecting to the Bitcoin network, then you wouldn't be able to spend your coins. 
To say this doesnt make OpenBazaar censorship resistant but it does with Bitcoin (or drop zone) is pretty ridiculous. And one could say, well you can try to circumvent those attacks with tor, sure but you can do that with OB as well.
And the fact that they criticize the commercial appeal of OB while thinking that their product, drop zone, has any commercial appeal at all shows they are off in looney land.

The sender always knows what address the coins were sent to. In this case you have a stealth address, call it S. Which is used by the sender's wallet to derive a new bitcoin address, A, to which the coins are sent. 
Of course the sender knows both S and A, but nobody looking at the blockchain can tell that A was derived from S.

Currently the merchant displays either a QR code or URI which, when clicked or scanned, initiates a download of a signed payment request from the merchant. 
The wallet verifies the integrity of the signature and certificate and displays the payment request to the user. If they click OK then the payment is signed and sent back to the merchant who broadcasts it. 
This isn't the only way it can be done, but it's the only way used at the moment.

There wasn't a plan for this just a few weeks ago either, but here we are. 


Replacing txs with others that send coins to a different address really has no purpose but to aid others in fraud. I'm highly skeptical of the notion that as fees become more important miners will turn to aiding in fraud to get by. It would be a mistake to make economic policy based on a hunch.

I don't know if "owning themselves" is a philosophically (or legally) correct way to think about it. 
There is a sense in which all resources which others are prohibited from using must be owned by someone. If I had to re-phrase it I would likely say the vehicle started out as the private property of the creator who more or less donated it to the public at large. 
So essentially everyone would be part owner in some sense rather than it being owned by itself.

The same malware that steals your wallet file will steal your coinbase password as well. And no insurance will get your coins back. 
You can say, "ya but I use 2FA with coinbase".... But you can do that (using multisig) with a standard wallet as well. You don't gain any security by using coinbase. If anything you are adding an attack vector (their servers) while totally compromising your financial privacy.

A large part of the reason Bitcoin functions at all is it relys on a collective action problem, or a 'who goes first problem', to hold consensus. Even if a majority of miners wish to change the rules you have the problem of 'who is going to be the first one to broadcast a previously invalid block' 
If you are the first to do so and nobody else accepts it, you will lose money. So nobody wants to go first. 
One potential way around that problem that is that miners can advertise in their blocks 'hey when we reach a threshold I'm going to accept previously invalid blocks' (although this still is no guarantee).  But doing so is transparent to everyone and spv clients should be able to catch that happening.
It's extremely difficult to imagine miners could unilaterally change the block reward, even if they were the only ones running nodes. Thats the nature of collective action problems.

It doesn't use anything at the moment. That is still an open question. For bip70 Mike's idea is to have your certificate hosted on there with the sender downloading it, verifying the signature, and pushing the tx back.

With entanglement it is indeed possible. If one half of an entangled pair was on earth and the other half in the Andromeda galaxy, a change to the state of one half of the pair would instantly change the other half.
My understanding, however, is that they don't know of any way to measure a photon without breaking the entanglement. So the current quantum teleportation techniques require data about the original photon to be sent along another communication channel to set the other photon in the correct state. That would be useful for quantum cryptography, but not FTL communication. 
But it appears the data transmission via entanglent would be instantaneous if they could figure out how to make it work.

@_date: 2015-02-23 17:08:53
Correct but I'll offer a slight nuance. The reduction in supply is already factored into the current price. If there were no time discount, we would not expect to see any change in price when we reach the halving (if there were constant demand). 
Since everything is time discounted we should see a steady rise in price as we approach the halving and no sudden change when we reach it. (again if demand were constant).

This isn't intended to prevent blockchain analysis, rather to provide some privacy from network observers (the nodes/server your wallet is communicating with).

The analysis is correct but I would add that Tor doesn't help much here. You end up with a pseudonymous list of all your addresses in someone else's possession. Additionally, every time you make a tx the other party is able to link your real world identity to one of your addresses (the exception being darknet transactions).
If those two separate pieces of information are combined, then other people can learn your entire tx history. The more transactions you make, the greater the probability that this could happen to you. 
Part of the reason I'm working on an alternative communication channel which can be used to send payments directly to the recipient.

The answer is *time preference*. People prefer satisfaction of their wants today more than satisfaction in the future. 
Yes, you save money by waiting but you have yo go without the good for a period of time. Some people will choose to wait, some will not. But this doesn't imply that no one will spend money. 


Because, your costs will be lower as well. If some consumers save, the lower demand will force down all prices including your costs. Your profit margin on the new iPhone will be the same as it otherwise would have been. 
If you want to make the case that there is some giant market failure out there that prevents prices from adjusting go right ahead. I'm not going to buy it however.

As washington said, the data in the node's home directory is seeded in ipfs. The (signed) hash of the directory is mapped to your peerID in the dht. 
When visiting a node you first resolve the peerID into the directory hash. So if you change any data that is reflected immediately in the change of the hash. 
It also presents some challenges with the persistence of that directory hash if you change it frequently.

Normally if you point out the censorship they ban you. Which wouldn't surprise me if I'm banned for this comment. 
And it's not just deleting comments and banning people, they often change the sort order for narrative manipulation purposes to make it appear like the most downvoted comments are the best when it fits the narrative.

@_date: 2013-10-24 11:06:30
This isn't correct analysis. Money *is* an investment asset.
There are two reasons for this:
1) Not everything we wish to consume is available right now. I may have $5,000 on hand and the  thing I want to do with it is to go snowboarding in Aspen...but it isn't winter yet. Hence I have to *save* that money if I want to go on vacation. Same could be said of retirement savings.
Whether one invests in cash or some other financial asset will depend on their risk tolerance (cash is the least risky asset) and the expected return. 
2) People most certainty *will* abstain (at least in part) from consumption provided that they prefer the greater level of future consumption to present consumption. Whether or not they invest in the monetary unit or something else will again depend on risk tolerance and expected return. 


Like... duh.
That is clearly false for the reasons mentioned above.
The comparison of money to a stock when analyzing how and why people invest is relevant insofar as money only differs from other commodities in that it has an extra demand component due to its role in indirect exchange.
If you want to prove the analology in this article false, you need to show why it's alleged that:
1) Increases in expected future value of a stock gets incorporated into the present stock price whereas increases in the expected future value of money cause expectations and price to spiral upwards to infinity. 
2) People don't reduce consumption down to zero in the face of rising stock prices but they will do this in the face of rising price of money.
It's pretty obvious neither of this can be demonstrated, hence the analogy of money and stock is relevant.

The point was to illustrate opportunity cost. The cost of buying one sub from subway is what you could have bought with those funds (whether dollars or bitcoins). In both cases you are giving up a potentially larger amount of future money. 
The point is people still make the decision to buy the sub despite the opportunity cost because people have *time preference*. That is, they prefer satisfaction of their wants now to satisfaction in the future, even if future satisfaction is greater.

That's true, but there are a couple considerations. At least initially, the price level would reflect whatever level of consumption people chose. So choosing to consume 80% vs 90% of your income shouldn't effect the macro economy. 
Now, if the rate of saving were to *increase* over time, some economists would suggest that would create problems because of wage/price stickiness. But that assumes both that wage/price stickiness is a severe problem and that savings would increase for some reason rather than remaining stable. 
Both are possible, but my opinion is that it isn't that likely.  
But that, of course, is a fundamentally different argument than those claiming nobody has any incentive to spend bitcoin.

What about creating some sort of m of n bounty fund on a server that people can contribute to? Maybe each transaction, in addition to a miner fee, you could optionally send an output to the bounty fund. 
The obelisk server could communicate to the bounty server telling it that it's connected. The bounty server could then distribute the funds to those running the clients at regular intervals. Could that work?

25 new Bitcoins are created every block of transactions. For a miner to create a new block he must submit a valid "proof of work". You can think of it like a requirement to submit an answer to a math problem if you want to create a block. The answer to the math problem can only be found by running random numbers through an equation over and over until it is found.
The difficulty of the math problem is calculated such that, on average, only one miner in the network will solve it approximately every ten minutes. Every two weeks the difficulty is recalculated to factor in changes in the amount of processing power in the network.
This is how the protocol regulates Bitcoin creation to target 25 BTC ~ every 10 minutes.

By my rough calculations, the network would need a transaction volume somewhere around ~300 to 500 transactions per second to create the same incentive as the current block reward from transactions fees only (assuming fees stay about the same).

I usually find her blog posts lacking. At least she didn't conclude by suggesting that demand curves slope upwards. 
To note, all demand curves *must* slop downwards because of diminishing marginal utility. Ie. The marginal good satisfies a lower valued end. If it satisfied a higher value end then people would chose to satisfy that end first. 
The only extent you can say demand increases with prices is if the demand curve shifts to the right. That is to say if people demand less of some other good and shift demand into the good where price is rising.

Then the person or group who feels threatened by the criminal should pay the cost of incarceration. It still doesn't justify coercing people into paying for something they don't want. Maybe a protection agency would find it cheaper to simply incarcerate the person than to try to protect everyone from a psycho at large. Maybe people will take up a collection.

As I mentioned in my comment, you don't need to assume falling wages. If Bitcoin were universally used as money, the demand for Bitcoins would be roughly stable. Nominal wages would only fall in such case due to population growth (expanding labor supply). Although, most likely it would only be starting salaries that would fall due to pop. growth  since wages tend to increase with raises yoy as worker productivity increases. This would likely offset population growth. This means the average family would have relatively stable nominal wages (real wages would be increasing).  So we can dismiss his claim of falling wages from the start.

On the consumer side I'll use Paypal as an analogy for what I think will need to be built.
To use Paypal for internet purchases you would need to first deposit money and keep a positive balance. 
But this is inconvient. Why would I want to keep a balance in Paypal for off chance I might want to make an internet purchase sometime soon? The inconvience of keeping my money locked in Paypal is typically greater than the inconvience of entering my credit card number in a website.
So what Paypal does is they let you make a purchase *even if you don't have any money in your Paypal account*. They just bill your checking account then credit the merchant's Paypal account.
I think Bitcoin will need something similar. A firm like coinbase could allow you to pay with Bitcoin *even if you don't own any*. They will just bill your checking account and forward the Bitcoins to the merchant. 
When a system like this is created, I think you will see consumer adoption increase.

This is how coinbase does it. You deposit bitcoin into their shared wallet. They make an accounting entry in their books showing you have a balance with them.

I stand by my assessment. Marginal utility is always diminishing. Griffin goods, Veblen or whatever are simply bad theories. The reason for this is because they are not subjective enough.
Consumers subjectivity consider all the qualities of a good when deciding to make a purchase, including price. If people want to purchase more as the price goes up it is because, in their mind, they view it as a different good. 
Again, if any of the subjective qualities change, we are speaking of a different good with a different demand curve.
If you want to argue otherwise, start by explaining how marginal utility is not falling.

Bitcoin has two (actually more) functions - a digital currency and a payment system.
Should bitcoin be widely adopted as a payment system (ie. Dollars--&gt;bitcoin, send bitcoin, bitcoin--&gt;dollars) it will naturally become less volatile. At some point one would expect people to say, "why am I encurring the cost to trade in and out of dollars when I can just spend the bitcoin directly?" When that happens bitcoin becomes a currency.

@_date: 2013-05-20 23:23:54
This is wrong on multiple levels. 
First, demand curves are always and everywhere downward sloping. If you want to say, "but as price went up, people purchased more!", that means the demand curve shifted to the right as more people became interested. The statement, "we’d see that demand often corresponds positively with price", is just wrong. Demand curves can shift in either direction, but they are always falling. 
Second, he seems to be confused about the concept of supply. 
"in the very short term, the supply of bitcoin imminently available– in people’s wallets and on exchanges– is a function of price. But in the short to medium term, the supply is fixed– that is, it takes time to mine coin; at any given moment, there is a fixed quantity absolutely available."
Supply curves in the traditional model slope upwards because of reservation demand. This comes either from speculation on the part of those currently holding bitcoin that the price will be higher in the future, or the utility of holding bitcoin (possibly as a hedge against uncertainty). 
It is true that the 'stock' of bitcoins is fixed at any given moment in time, but 'stock' and supply are two different economic concepts. We could reconstruct a tradition supply and demand chart by lumping reservation demand in with the demand from buyers and plotting this 'total demand curve' against a vertical 'stock' curve. This would accomplish the same thing, but he seems to be confusing traditional supply/demand with total demand/stock. 
"Or rather: miner-owners sold their bitcoin on the market. They made these decisions to sell based on their initial investment in the miner, seeking commensurate returns. But when they discovered they could clear their inventories, and sell all of them off, they began to raise prices."
This makes no sense. He's suggesting the supply increase raised price. Even if we take a supply increase for granted, normally that would drive prices down not up. The only way prices could go up in the face of increasing supply is if the increase in demand outstrips the increase in supply. However, it doesn't follow that one causes the other. 
"So: the supply of bitcoin, speaking in the short to medium term, grew a lot in a very short time."
Has anyone checked to see if this is correct? It should be relatively easy to prove. I'm a bit skeptical that a huge number of coins dumped on the market before the difficulty had a chance to adjust. 
While I appreciate the enthusiasm for this theory, he is wrong. And it is a bit disconcerting that the author identifies himself as a CFO.

Not sure that would work. For one the outputs need to be signed by the person making the transaction. So unless that person knows the address of the node he is sending to in advance, this probably wouldn't work. 


The problem is it isn't really random. You typically connect to about 8 other nodes and relay transactions to them. I suppose you could query each for an address and randomly send them bitcoins, but that's not really random. People may try to strategically connect to certain nodes.

The fact that people still spend in a deflationary environment is key - not a straw man. For as long as there are expenditures, there will be prices. As long as those prices are free to adjust it is unlikely deflation will cause recession/ unemployment etc.
The burden is on you guys to prove that in a genuine free market (not one like today where many prices are controlled directly or indirectly) prices would not adjust.
The 'proof' that is usually offered is the existence of recessions, which amounts to nothing more than circular reasoning. "Sticky wages and prices cause recessions. How do we know sticky wages and prices exist? Well, there are recessions". Sorry, not good enough.
The fact that the demand for money rises during a recession seems to provide some evidence in your favor. However I would say you are getting the causation backwards. It's not that the demand for money increased causing recession, but rather the increased uncertainty surrounding the recession caused the demand to increase.
 If recessions are caused by something else, namely manipulation of credit - see ABCT - then we have very little reason to buy into the theory that wages and prices won't adjust in a free market. Hence, deflation is not a boogie man and an inflationary supply of money/credit is something that should be avoided at all costs.

The fee is paid to whichever miner mines the block with your transaction in it. It's there primarily to prevent attackers from spamming the network with transactions sent between themselves. 
Right now the fees are arbitrarily set by the protocol, but the next version of Bitcoin (.9) will allow miners to set their own fees and the software will give you an estimate of how large of a fee you need to include to get your transaction in the next block or next two blocks etc.

Seem to me the news is worse than people seem to think
* All financial institutions are prohibited from having anything to do with bitcoin. Including creating bitcoin services and owning it in their portfolios. That cuts out an enormous part of potential future demand.
* It's pretty clear the government views bitcoin as a threat to the RMB. It seems they only want it traded as a commodity and that's it. They said explicitly that goods and services shouldn't be priced in BTC and it shouldn't be used to buy goods and services (it's unclear to me if this only applies to financial institutions but it's clear they intend to protect the RMB at all costs).
That was a very aggressive play. By relegating it to nothing by a commodity to be traded on an exchange then what good is it?

I made it pretty clear in the article that I wasn't critiquing sticky wages (I linked to an article where I did that) but rather the bad argument presented by Yglesias and many others.
Second, outside of a demand shock, nominal wages aren't likely to fall (on net). If you think they would then I'd suggest you are misunderstanding deflation. If the supply and (reservation) demand for money were to remain constant, only those goods and services which expand in supply will fall in price, not everything.
In a stable economic environment, the supply of labor only expands by the population growth rate. At best you could say that would cause a *slight* drop in nominal wages. But even then, at the individual level, this likely wouldn't translate into nominal wage cuts because people typically get raises as they advance in their careers. The rate of raises and starting pay will likely be lower due to pop growth, but most won't experience a nominal wage cut. 
Only a demand shock could necessitate a need to cut nominal wages. But then it becomes a question of how likely is a demand shock when the Fed isn't out there creating unsustainable bubbles. And how sticky would wages really be absent other labor market interventions. 
Either way, this wasn't the argument I was critiquing and I was pretty clear about it.

If bitcoin was a universal medium of exchange then we would expect its demand to be relatively stable. 
In such a scenario, the only reason the widget price would fall from 2 BTC to .9 BTC is if the supply of widgets has increased over that period. 
Any entrepreneur thinking of going into the widget market needs to estimate competition and forecast total supply and price when he brings his own product to market. 
Same thing with the lender. The lender needs to look over the business plan and see if the entrepreneurs estimates are correct. If not (as in this case) the lender should not make the loan.
The fact that the loan isn't made doesn't suggest the economy can't grow, it just means widget production has already reached its max (at the given cost of production) and the loanable funds would be better channeled into some other line of production.

This isn't really true. Borrowers and lenders factor the deflation (or inflation) rate into the contract. If deflation is expected interest rates will be lower as a result (because the loan is repaid in more valuable money).
Only **unanticipated** deflation is a problem for borrowers. But then unanticipated inflation is a problem for lenders as well. 
The laws of economics work the same in both the real economy and Bitcoin economy. And in both deflation isn't nearly the problem central bank apologists make it out to be.

I couldnt disagree more. There are no real approximations of a free market in healthcare or education today.I suppose you would have look at the shoe industry maybe to find one that is approximately free. And not surprisingly we find an abundance of shoes at prices ranging from $10 to $1,000. The poor have no trouble affording them. There is nearly infinite variety. Tremendous competition. Nothing even approximating monopoly. That is how a market functions. The healthcare sector here in the US looks nothing like that. The fact that I buy private insurance isn't evidence of a free market. What we have here is a government sanctioned and privileged medical cartel that exploits customers for profit. They lobbied for this privilege precisely because they couldn't get their way in the free market.
And as the data. Most economic arguments are based on deductive logic which you don't need data to 'prove'. At best you can use the data to support the argument. In this case, we see tons of evidence in the real world that freer markets lead to better outcomes than socialism. The ultimate test case for socialism was the Soviet union. Not only was it a human rights nightmare, but an economic nightmare as well.

For those who are interested there is a way to shrink the size of the Lamport public and private keys:
The random number pairs in the private key can be generated deterministically from a single key saving space in the wallet. 
The public key pairs can be hashed together shortening them to a single key.
The digital signature would then need to include the 160 correct private key values plus the hash of the 160 unused values. 
To verify the sig you would hash the message, then hash the corresponding values in the sig. Then hash them all together and compare to the public key. 
With this method, the public key shrinks from 51,200 bits to 160 bits, but the signature increases from 25,600 bits to 51,200. This would save about 50% space in the blockchain compared to the method in the article.

Absolutely false. There are several reasons an economy might experience deflation. Here we are talking about a growing supply of goods and services (economic growth) combined with a fixed stock of money (another would be a drop in aggregate demand, but that isn't what he is referring to here).
In this scenario, it's not *all* prices that fall as he suggests, but only those where the good /service has expanded in supply. In reality, average wages would only fall by the population growth rate. In particular instances it is unlikely individual wages would fall at all since you tend to get raises as you become more productive (which happens as your career progresses). So to the extent that wages fall due to population growth (combined with a fixed money stock), it is likely to only affect starting salaries. 
So the hypothetical situation where wages are falling and your mortgage payments are fixed just won't happen in the real world (demand shocks not withstanding). 
Now one might object that as Bitcoins increase in value, your (real) deflation adjusted mortgage payments may increase, but this is simply the case that when loans are taken out the expected deflation over the term is factored into the interest rate. Rates will be lower than then otherwise would be without deflation expectations, so your deflation adjusted payments will remain the same.

See my other comment. It contained zero economic analysis. It was some guy spreading fud about bitcoin to pump his own business.
Why would something like that get up voted if not for ideology?
If you follow that sub enough you see that most up/down vote based on ideology not quality of the analysis.
I suspect 2/3 of that community are the same people in r/politics

It would be more cost effective still to just make them pay restitution. Dead people dont pay restitution. 
Either way there is still going to be a defined legal code. It will just look more like the common law than the 1 million pages of arbitrary bs that comes from legislatures.

The non sequitur is to assume that taxes are necessary for a functioning society. We reject that opinion as have a number of very smart economists. Just about any services that is necessary to make society function can be provided for more efficiently and cheaper through markets.

Your asymmetric argue might hold for monopoly but not competition.
 And the poor concern is illegitimate. *If* it could be shown that the poor won't be able to afford a basic education (a big if), it only follows that those few poor should be helped. It doesn't follow that everyone else should be forced into an inferior education.

Of course you do realize that a recession brings about such an amount of uncertainty that people increase their rate of savings (ex. The great depression and every other recession). No free market economist denies this. Thus we would expect recessions to be coupled with deflation. The question isn't whether recessions are coupled with deflation or not but whether one caused the other. You are claiming that deflation CAUSES depression. I've cited a paper that givens numerous examples of periods of deflation that were not coupled with depression - including the frigging INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION!  How do you explain the fact that the greatest period of economic growth the world has known took place in a deflationary environment?

This isn't nearly as bad as coinvalidation which is basically trying to make it illegal to use bitcoin unless you are "registered".

I'd like to know how he came up with those numbers. If bitcoin becomes a "major player" (his words) in payments, that would imply a value of $1,500 or more just from payments. But he also suggests it could compete with silver to be a store of value which would give it a much higher valuation. More like $10,000 or more in that case.
If that estimate is what he *thinks* it will do, it seems OK, but as far as a high end estimate its not even in the same ballpark.

The rich don't pay the burden of taxes. Here in NJ middle class families pay 8,000 a year or more for schools. That's outrageous. Especially when you consider the information they are taught is available for free.
And higher education is mostly a waste. 80% or more is nothing but signalling, which has negative externalities. 
Europe is probably more wasteful since they subsidize the negative externalities more heavily.

Yes if you have malware you will lose your bitcoins. If this is a hot wallet then you should probably just have set up the wallet offline then restarted.
However, it sounds like you want to make a cold storage wallet. There are best practices for that.

Shooting someone for trespass isn't a proportional use of force so no.
Why would the biggest agency be able to get away with it? It would need to violently overthrow all other agencies. It is infinity cheaper and more ethical to just have the disputing parties work it out in court and enforce the outcome.

I see. Let me ask this.. It's kind of my impression that miners won't use GetBlockTemplate when the cost of running a full validating node gets too high. Like when the block chain is in the multi-terabyte range. 
Do you think the issues with having to get work every second will out-weight the benefit of pushing the valadating off on the pool operator and cause people to switch to GetBlockTemplate or will miners still prefer the traditional method to keep from running a full valadating node?

If you pre-ordered a BFL 50 GH/s miner today, by the time it shipped and you fired it up, you would end up with a negative return on investment.

The point isn't to compare socialist institutions to what existed 200 years ago. It is to compare them to competitive systems which sink or swim based on how well they serve people. Obviously government healthcare and educational institutions are vastly inferior. 
Economics explains this perfectly. Government institutions lack the proper incentives and the knowledge that come from offering your product to people for voluntary purchase.

Then help the person pay for it yourself. Why are you so stingy that everyone else needs to be forced to pay for something you want to see be done?


They are governments after all. Accountable to no one.


What would a fire company charge $500? The fact that .0001% of the population will have a hard time paying $500  in a once in a lifetime event doesnt justify the use of violence. And again, there is charity. And why would others end up footing the bill? Who's going to force them to pay? 


 No such thing.


If the victim doesn't want to punish the perp then she can just take restiution. Jailing a criminal is about justice for the victim. Why should anyone but the victim pay for it?
In extreme cases the incarceration is about preventing other violent crime by keeping a violent person off the street. In those cases those who want to see it done (or their insurance) should pay. But nobody should be forced into paying for it.

Police: only people who pay get the service. What is wrong with that? Why should non-payers get served. I doubt many people wouldn't be able to afford it, but in such cases people can seek charity.
Arbitration: Nobody knows exactly how it would work, but the incentive is to resolve the dispute peacefully. Consider, if I accuse you of stealing my television and contact my defense agency to get it back. It turns out that my agency also happens to be the same agency that you have hired to protect your property. Who does the agency side with? Most likely if you and I cant settle on an arbiter, it will just pick one for us and enforce the ruling. The arbitration firm may even be enumerated in the contract we sign with the protection agency. What if we patron separate firms? Still the incentive is for the firms to peacefully decide on a neutral arbiter. Most likely this will be done in advance before any inter-firm dispute occurs and again the arbiter will most likely be enumerated in the contract. If the United States and Canada can avoid settling disputes between their citizens with violence then certainly firms relying on voluntarily paying customers can do the same
Fire: I assume your thinking in terms of fire insurance where you pay a monthly fee and the fire company comes out when you call them. What if you dont pay the monthly fee? Then they just bill you for the full cost of putting out the fire. You simply pay for the service like anything else. Indont see why that is hard to figure out.
Street lighting: the lighting isn't for the homeowners it's for the cars that drive on the road. Obviously the road company would be responsible for installing lighting on their roads, just like Walmart installs lights in their parking lots. Its not that difficult of a concept. If you want light on your house install some exterior lights, don't force your neighbors to pay for it.
Jails: to the extent they even needed they would most likely be funded by the same insurance plan that pays for your investigation, court fees, legals fees and all other expenses you incur when you are the victim of a crime.
You're gonna have to do a lot better.

Nobody follows the constitution anymore. If they could make it so that all that was needed was a single federal license (or even if a state license was portable to other states) that would massively ease the burden on start ups right now. 
Of course no licenses would be better.
