Catastrophic care might as well be no care at all, especially if companies are allowed to drop you or raise your rate as soon as you try to use it.

Your idea of only funding ER care through taxes is a good start, but flawed for two reasons.   
First, we all already pay for ER care for the uninsured as hospitals raise their rates (and in some cases, may be allowed to bill the state if I recall) to make up for the money they couldn’t collect from those patients.   
Second, care can be incredibly expensive and ruinous to people’s budgets. For example, this winter I had the flu, or so I thought (fever on the couch sleeping all weekend). I eventually went to the urgent care place (not ER, think walk-in clinic). Nurse practitioner took a nose swab, ran the test on the spot, told me I had the flu, wrote a prescription. Also cleaned out my ears with special high pressure water tool because they had been clogged with wax for over a year. The cost of this 20 total minutes of the nurse practitioners time? $400. Plus $75 for the prescription medication. So $475 for something that was through no fault of my own.  
That’s 65.5 hours (more than a week at 40hr!) of working at minimum wage *before* taxes. That’s more than a family of four spends on groceries. All because the expensive insurance my family pays good money for (over $20k per year, which is a big chunk of our gross income) is a high-deductible health plan which doesn’t cover anything until the family spends $12k or one individuals costs exceed $6k. So we are responsible for every dime up to $12k a year.   
Most Americans have no savings, let alone enough to cover $12k worth of medical expenses. I’m very privileged that my family did have the savings to cover it, but in some families living paycheck to paycheck, they would have gone hungry, been late on rent, or missed a payment on their car that month, all because someone got sick.   
No American should have to work more than a week, risk going hungry, losing a place to live, or lose their car (which they probably need to get to their job!) just because someone in their family had the flu for a weekend and went to the doctor to get treated. It simply should never happen, period. And full universal healthcare is the answer to that.

Oh shit, yeah I meant to reply to Saw the caps in your post (after reading it and a bunch of other nearby comments and coming back to write my reply) and thought it was one of theirs. And the prescription was for Tamiflu, which isn’t an antibiotic and does help with the flu if you catch it soon enough. But yeah, American healthcare costs are extremely excessive.

Exactly this. What kind of economic policies does think would have been better to end the depression? The “unregulated free market” that got us there in the first place?

Sure sounds like it, not without declaring it at least. And if not your checkbook, at least a blank check (payee filled out and check signed, only amount blank) seems like it would be prohibited without declaration.
