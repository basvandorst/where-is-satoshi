In my experience selling anything online is more difficult than people think, you have to be in for the long term and really communicate well with your customers. You pretty much get back what you put in.
The hardest part is getting finding a way to get in touch with your customers, for some products it is harder than others. For instance there may be people looking to buy Fake Pink Panda Bears out there but communicating with them as a group can be really hard - that is until you find a big forum of "Fake Pink Panda Bear Lovers".
Bitcoin is exciting because people (like me) love Bitcoin and would really like to use it to help with its acceptance. So for a while it may be a bit easier to find customers who are more motivated than usual. That sounds a little predatory but I think it's right, I for instance would instantly prefer somebody selling in btc over somebody who isn't and would even buy stuff I wouldn't normally.
A rant, but hopefully something useful in there.

Pushing their competition to do it as well is probably the best way of applying pressure - once one does it they all will.
I'll email Xero...

It was actually through Bitdazzle. Bit of a crazy process though as their ordering system seems a bit broken (I received the payment through Coinbase but no shipping address or order details - the guy had to email me).
And the website! Of course! We have a basic one here  the problem with being a web developer is I never get to work on our stuff :)
