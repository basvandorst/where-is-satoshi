It's probably because the Bitfinex scammers are using Binance and Bittrex to launder their USDTs and not anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:21:56
So it's coinbase, are we f'd?
Make sure your pws are different and have 2fa.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:18:31
no it won't
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:57:37
but, just fyi, Bitfinex printed a bunch of tethers right after the futures came out which probably is contributing to some of the rise.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:48:50
lols man wtf....
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:59
When people don't want usdt anymore, they will destroy some of it to keep it at $1.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:18:03
same here, can anyone investigate where the ips are from?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:05
lol, I put in a buy order for 14k, will sell it again at 16k.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:58:26
you should ask who does NOT have.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:13:49
No it's only CME and stock exchanges. Google it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:21:16
How does this work? I'm missing a step. Printing tethers increases supply which decreases prices. The only way to keep the price = 1 USD is by increasing demand for it. How is demand increased? That's one question. If demand increases then there will be selling pressure on bitcoin which should theoretically decrease bitcoin prices. Why would you said it raises the prices? That's the 2nd question.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:45:37
can confirm
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:26:17
no idea
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:03
The exchange stops trading it if it moves that much.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:35:59
What would happen if they kept on printing tethers? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:45:21
no tldr
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:50:05
What is the mechanism of this tether?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:13:58
Wash sale 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:42:05
If you have 50M printed and nobody wants it, how is the price still trading at $1? Are you going to pay $1 for crap? I can sell you my crap for $1. lol.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:35:53
It makes sense if they were just meeting denand. If you don't want the price to go above 1$ the answer is to print more. And likewise the other way. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:27:19
Is it safe even on a bank run? Would fdic really insure it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:55:27
Theres a 20% down limit before halting on futures so on monday the lowest would be 12k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:47
I'm here just to get karma. I'm hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:03:35
man.... but a bit late owell
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:19:50
good riddance
everyone's greed blinding them to the clues
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:12:06
 the wall street traders havent had a chance to touch it yet though 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:42
I need a gif of this
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:54:56
For example the Hong Kong dollar is tethered to USD by controlling the supply. 
oh nvm.. .I think I answered my own question. since there is huge demand for usdt, they can easily print. There will be no effect on BTC in that case.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:52:28
all $100?
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:06:25
You guys last minute living on the edge. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:23:05
It took longer for other transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:41:38
We're going mainstream yo. My guess 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:51:29
Where is said audit?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:29:21
But then there's always regrets lol 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:20:58
Yea you know me 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:17:06
Do they know your cost basis? Where did you see this rule? How will it be enforced? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:51:06
I dunno, but I profited and sold
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:27:10
Bittrex. It went up even more lol. Fuck me. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:50:59
probably just logged into someone else's account
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:46:06
Did coinbase finally comply with the the account information request? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:28:15
I found it on my bittrex account and just sold it for btc 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:42:17
That is an expensive hard drive.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:26:19
This thread shows that they can be trusted no? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:13:26
Yea but last night shows that they didn't inflate their positions.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:52:29
Ty, but it still shows 0 for some reason. Maybe my hypthesis is bad?
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:01:37
I paid off my car with it in 2017. Then someone rear ended it and insurance company paid me back cash for the whole car. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-10-13 11:02:09
He can do it better than you.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:55:19
But do you think my hypothesis is reasonable?
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:21:44
some people sold their houses
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:27:50
I down voted the 7 and upvoted the 6.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:58:04
It looks like the limit down/up feature will not allow it to go crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:16:13
He's not an idiot. In the US no one can take your house.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:16:18
can you do a TLDR? sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:59:54
I see FUD
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:10:10
And what if I don't live in USA? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:25:56
What if I am not a US citizen but I sell for USD from coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:37:05

I'd trade it in front of him so I can get comp.
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:06:49
But the keys will be stored on an online computer, isn't that dangerous too?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:31:57
They don't even want to wait for the confirmations?

Thank you, do you know how Electrum will show you your balance on both networks after the fork?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:57:36
What if you are not based in USA? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:46:04
So where where are the keys stored for the new address? I thought it's not safe to have my keys stored on my online computer?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:59:06
lol, everyone needs their private key to sign a transaction
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:03:35
I only have 0.507mbtc in there which is smaller than the transaction fees, could that be why?
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:10:44
Oi bitch is someone who uses btc buy a Hyundai
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:04:42
If I reuse my original address with the offline original keys, is security still compromised?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:55:05
How does electrum generate keys using only the mpk without the private key? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:13:46
