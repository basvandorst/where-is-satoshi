Bullshit most of you guys won't hold the next time Bitcoin makes a 30% dip. This survey is worthless.

In 3-4 months the hype for the Bitcoin halving will start. The halving is the biggest event for bitcoin. What do you think will happen? I will give you a clue. People will start to front run the upcoming halving and pump bitcoin.

I have structured my life to have as few liabilities as possible. As a result of this life structuring of few liabilities I can afford to make high risk high rewards investments or Gamble's as you would call it.

Then why you even here? It wont matter what I say nothing will convince you. Jesus told people he was the son of god and and people didn't believe him, instead they called him a witch and then hung him on a cross to die.
I am far from being Jesus Christ but my point is it wont matter who I am jesus or not sometimes some people cant be convinced. 
You call it a huge gamble, Your life most likely already probably sucks balls. What else you got to lose? Bitcoin has huge upside, for fuck sakes dont be a pussy and drop $8500 on 1 bitcoin and set a stoplimit for like $5000. If bitcoin drops to $5000 then you only lost $3000 .... I have wasted more than $3000 on whores to suck my cock and blow on weed. If you cant see what is happening then you are one stupid fucker. Its like the early days of the dot com bubble right now ..... over the next 2 years a good handful of cryptos will pump hard.

You will buy in again at $20,000 and then bitch and moan when the price crashes 40% again. Some people are not built for investing in crypto. People like you want a safe sure fire way to make profit. Stick too your 401k retirement plan, maybe in 30-40 years you will have enough to retire with a hotdogs for dinner retirement budget. Keep you money safe in the bank you retard. I will be laughing at people like you when negative interest rates and bank bail-ins come around and your deposits are slowly getting wiped out!

I got in crypto in late 2016 and used some credit cards, I have no regrets about it. It really depends at what point in the 3 year bull cycle you buy in at. Anyone buying 1 bitcoin today on credit cards and holds for the next 2 years or until things get really super bullish crazy will likely make at least $150,000 profit if not a little more even after paying all the interest and debt repayment. Problem is that people only want to buy when every fucking moron with 2 brain cells is buying. The time to be buying bitcoin is now when its boring .....everyone is scared and the price has just crashed 44%.  Bitcoin is on discount retards!

Hey dipshit I am not saying take a LOC against your home. I am saying put $8500 of debt on your credit card to buy 1 Bitcoin and set a stop limit at $5000. Worst cast you lose $3500 plus interest. If a $5-6k lost is gonna make you homeless than you got much bigger problems in your life. Worst case if you get to much in debt on credit cards then declare bankruptcy. You won't be homeless.
