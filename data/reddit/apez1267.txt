its not about spending them , its about preventing anyone ELSE from spending them because any other client who tried to varify the coin would see that someone else has it , you cant have a currency if noone can use it

as of right now i haven't actually bought any bitcoins because every time im about to enter my credit card number i get flashes of Nigerian prince scams but im seriously thinking about it , i do know one person who has bitcoins but they are a pot head and im not sure if i want to deal with them when all i want a good vpn without creds to trace

speaking from the point of view as a bitcoin noob i have to say that although i like the concept it feels like the effort im putting into bitcoins far exceeds the reward im getting out of it , as someone who dosnt have any local bitcoin users im looking at going back to prepaid gift cards 
my challenge to you all--- explain why a 5.00 charge for a prepaid giftcard is a bad idea over mtgox

thank , i had assumed bitcoin authentication might have been susceptible to an attack like what the wifi pineapple does except instead of accepting every response it simply responds to every response with a claim it already exists elsewhere

NSA + MITM would prevent all outside replys which could claim that the FED reserve dosnt already own all the bitcoins

as much as i dislike how the us gov't have handled the banking system i have to remind everyone here that if bitcoins become a large enough problem then the bitcoin system could be destroyed easily , bitcoins rely on other people/computers to vauge for their legitimacy , if i was in the gov i would just put up a listener that would record all existing coin sigs and then just tell all gov and banking computers to claim the gov already owns them . if all bitcoins become unverifiable then the system will crumble
