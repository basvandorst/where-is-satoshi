100% hold it. Only sell it if you are forced to because you need that money right now for a purpose (Which  I assume is not the case else you wouldn't play with the money).

Just another old man who doesn't understand technology and has a portfolio with fiat stocks.

No such thing. Else everyone would daytrade around that exact same time. This is btc, and it's wild.

How inaccurate. We all know Craig Wright needs to be the first person to show up.

Every once in a while I come back to that vid where he claims he's Satoshi and have a good laugh. Srsly can't believe how he thinks anyone would believe him lol, is there actually ANYONE who believes CW is the creator of bitcoin?

You didn't lose anything as long as you didn't sell it for FIAT. Just wait 6 months. Be patient. Mark this post.

Lol posts like this are always made because of frustration. Sorry you lost money.. if you want to get it back buy now.

Lol if you already panicked at this, I can only imagine how you would react when an actual real dip happens.

I always hate these comparisons with "lottery tickets". It's not even remotely close. More like an insult as there's a whole technology behind crypto. If you don't know the difference between gambling and putting money into crypto, then yes maybe this is not where you should put your money.
