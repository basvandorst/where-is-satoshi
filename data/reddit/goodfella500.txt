I made all my cold wallets using bitaddress.org brain wallet feature following youtube tutorial. I used passphrases over 100  random characters long and with some non-latin characters. Are my wallets safe? The tutorial suggested only minimum of 30 characters.

Even i cannot access it. I have some more. These are my first offline wallets. Stupidly instead of making brain wallets using bitaddress.org I made several BIP38 encrypted wallets with passphrases over 100 characters long and with some non-latin symbols. GOOD LUCK CRACKING IT!

I just printed them out for cold storage, did not memorize them. Regular paper wallets did not seem so safe because the website generates them "randomly" which i was told can be cracked.

Actually i am aware of that. Now i am little paranoid about accessing my brain wallets. I made them with using CD bootable UBUNTU. I have withdrawn BTC from brain wallet i made with my unsecure PC to be sure that bitaddress.org brain wallet IS accessible, but my paranoia is still there.
