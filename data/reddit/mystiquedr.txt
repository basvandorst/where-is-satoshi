It's because of Mike Hearn's position here, combined with my own personal experience transferring BTC on and off exchanges that I'm still a hold out on the block size debate. Specifically:


I emphatically agree. For example, the market price of BTC is roughly $300 USD today. During the spam attack, to be certain your transaction confirmed within the next block, you had to pay a fee of 0.0005 BTC.
    0.0005 BTC * $300 = $0.15
Now, imagine the market price for 1 BTC was $3000 or $30,000?
    0.0005 BTC * $3000 = $1.50
    0.0005 BTC * $30000 = $15.00
Now suddenly it's $1.50 or $15.00 to send ANY transaction on the Bitcoin network. This is a major stumbling block for the majority of people on this planet. With a $15.00 fee, if you aren't sending $1000 straight to its final destination, in ONE go, you're getting reamed on fees. It's genuinely a painful experience to do something like that.
Now imagine you want to do CoinJoin or multisig escrow payments with OpenBazaar. Those transactions have MULTIPLE HOPS. Multiply the base fee times two at a minimum, and now you're in for major pain.
So essentially, if Lightning Network or sidechains can't absolutely 100% replicate the functionality of multisig escrow, mixing and so forth, **and I'm convinced they cannot**, then the ONLY solution is to keep fees to a minimum. If this eats into the decentralization of full nodes, so be it. The fact is, the entire Bitcoin network always has been designed around cold storage, pure blockchain based payments. The MOMENT you suggest moving beyond that paradigm, the burden of proof is on YOU. I want to see OpenBazaar ricardian multisig escrow payments on Lightning. Where are they? Is it possible? Where is the implementation?!
