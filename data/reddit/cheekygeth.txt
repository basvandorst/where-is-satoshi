That's not the point. The point is that OP could have as much comment karma as he likes, but a read of this proves straight away this this absolutely didn't happen. At the end of the day, if this seems outlandish and insane coming from someone with 3 karma, it is equally *as* outlandish and insane when that person has 12000+. 
I'm sure OP is a trustworthy guy generally, but taking this story by its own merit and nothing else, you can easily deduce that it simply couldn't have happened.

The fact that someone is a nice guy does not instantly lend credibility to what is so blatantly an untrue, or at least seriously exaggerated story. If you can't see this is a fabrication designed to make a point, maybe your understanding of is a hindrance to your rationality, rather than an aid.

Oh yeah, it was the subject of this 10 year old child's lecture about allowing others to research the wonderful world of bit-coin which I found the problem with. Please accept my apologies sir. 
Thanks for getting this straightened out Mr Madness, consider me educated!

Yeah guys, he never said this update had to be *true*!
Jesus, you demand so much.

You mean for the teacher, right? Because this definitely happened, its on the internet.

Then you have no right to get upset over people accusing you of being wrong.
I totally respect your right not to want to post proof, that's cool, but saying you won't post proof, and getting upset when people call you a liar is kind of like having your cake and eating it too (and then telling people you aren't eating it with crumbs around your lips.) 
Besides, pictures, documents, literally anything, it would all pretty easily prove it more than a transcript, which I could knock up in 3 minutes.

Cleverly avoiding the original request there to provide some proof and instead get all upset and butthurt about people saying you have no proof. Do you really not see how delusional this looks?

Kind of unfortunate that they shat all over it at that sub. Can we agree that its fake yet? 
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:19:52
Then you'll respect my right not to be convinced by that?

Yes, a 10 year old child definitely said to his teacher. "It's ok, a lot of people are still not sure about BTC and that's why I added in my paper for everyone to do their own research."
This happened so hard it hurts.

Stranger things have and do happen, but when they so clearly align with a political agenda one obviously already has, one is forced to question if this kind of coincidence could actually occur. Redditor out to prove that Bitcoin is useful just happens to be oppressed by an idiot teacher and then joins forces with fellow Bitcoin lover, the principal of the school, to take her down a notch?
Come on. If this was just posted in a random sub by a random guy I'd be more lenient, but the way it lines up with OPs motives makes me question it far more than his karma makes me believe it. 
Though I suppose there's no need to abuse OP, though that's a personal opinion, everyone has a different view on the severity of lying.
