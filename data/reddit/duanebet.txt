Institutional money could push price up massively ... these are physical futures backed by ownership and not just future prices ... they have to own the bitcoin they are trading with so I think it could have a positive impact on price
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:21:41
The fact that you made this statement tells me you have no idea what bitcoin is about
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:10:02
Why ? Because he doesn’t believe in the tooth fairy shit that you call analysis ?

Good documentary

It doesn’t have to beat bitcoin - it’s not in competition ... it’s completely different with different use cases ... it’s electronic fiat and not a decentralised crypto currency ! It’s backed by actual fiat  currencies ..

@_date: 2018-09-18 08:11:19
Ignore the FUD mate ! This reddit is for posting whatever you feel like relating to bitcoin ! 
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:12:49
Don’t get me wrong ! I hate a scammer as much as anybody else ... but why would you go to a random site and generate a QR code ? Rookie mistake !
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:41:25
I agree with you ! Fun police this lot  ! What a bunch of bores ! You keep it up ! I talk bitcoin at most places I purchase to get word around ! 
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:45:25
Literally not a single statement of his was backed up with any evidence - I too could just make statements - “hey guys just to let you know bitcoin will be the only currency in the world by 2020 ! “ what a knob !

2025 - global internet currency at least - probably not taken over fiat as a world currency ... maybe small country adoptions but doubtful ... store of value taken over from gold as the standard ... value (only because of global internet currency use) I would think $100,000 plus

@_date: 2018-05-18 13:22:17
To be fair I know what you mean ... but I see it more as keeping the community positive ... when I promote bitcoin to friends I always use the examples in the subreddit .. telling people how widely it’s used, where the latest acceptance store is etc etc ... I think if we heard nothing then we would have nothing to promote ... 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:06:58

I literally ask at every bar or restaurant I go to whether they take bitcoin and I’ve never had a positive response ... most responses are around being clueless on the currency and don’t understand it ... at 1 kebab shop in Horsham the owner said he tried it for a while and got no responses so gave up

Seriously ! That’s your comment !? 
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:54:52
I like the thinking sir
@_date: 2019-11-20 10:23:30
Check if Altcoins still exist
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:58:33
I disagree sir ... I think bitcoins strongest use case right now is just that ... as a day to day exchange of value for goods we are miles away ... it’s currently a store of value and nothing more ... if it stays like that bitcoin has no real future other than replacing gold ... my personal ( may be wrong) opinion is that reserve currency will be the next big thing long before a medium of exchange
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:10:40
True ... as I did mention it’s just the way I see it personally ... would love the case for medium of exchange but I think the off chain hysteria a few years ago doesn’t seem to be getting much traction and we all know that writing direct to the blockchain is never going to be suitable for bitcoin as money
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:11:41

@_date: 2019-11-19 20:27:05

Don’t see the big deal as long as that information is in no way directly related to personal identifiable information ... so sharing Information for example about how often an app is opened on average across thousands of users for trend analysis info - no big deal ... which devices are used across the network - no big deal ... as long as no personal information is shared I have no problem

Not so much I to the TA predictions but do know that any bitcoin parabolic rise has been followed by a correction of sorts ... i would not be surprised if we dropped to the $8k mark for a period before shooting back up again ...

Stupid post
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:27:01
Yeah let’s keep posting shit like this so that we can send out the message that this is the use case of crypto to the world 
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:23:30
First thought was WTF !?! But let’s be honest here ... the whole idea about crypto is to use as a daily currency ... so if this gets people to buy crypto and start using their crypto it can only be a positive thing. It’s a carrier to better things and eventually people will kick back and refuse to use it and use personal wallets but hopefully by then the adoption is mainstream
@_date: 2019-12-19 10:40:00

Nothing changes ... the future where you get paid in BTC means you get taxed in BTC ... companies till need to declare profit and loss ... workers still need to declare income whether in fiat or BTC ... day to day activities like buying bread makes no difference as there are no tax implications anyway today with fiat ... vat will be charged in BTC ... replace dollar with BTC ... that’s it !

Defeats the object ... but ... First we use Visa cards using conversion and then pure bitcoin loaded cards followed by mass adoption using wallet transactions ... anything that has a possible knock on effect towards the mass adoption is progress 
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:14:15
Answer to first questions starts with “America wants a bitcoin  ETF” - where the hell did that information come from ? I didn’t say I wanted an ETF ... everybody is hyped up thinking ETF = increase in price ... and it may be but that’s not what bitcoin is about and is detrimental to the progress of the original bitcoin vision in the long run !

If you don’t understand how to backup and restore a personal wallet using seeds and owning your keys then stick to coinbase - too many people take advice from these tech nerds and end up losing their bitcoin

@_date: 2018-02-18 09:54:40
At its max there will be 21,000,000 BTC as we all know, If we took these bitcoins and multiplied them by 100,000,000 satoshi’s and divided by the total estimated fiat currency of the planet (around $215 trillion) the result is that bitcoin can accommodate the worlds currency 9,7 times over. This does however work on the basis that a satoshi equals a dollar and no smaller. This effectively means that we could replace every 10cents on the planet with a satoshi - INCREDIBLE !!!
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:28:25

That’s a load of crap - I found out about bitcoin and the technology at $7k and still invested because of the technology and what it is going to do to the worlds financial system ... why wouldn’t I invest at $10 ??? Especially in light of it coming out after a massive financial crisis !
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:50:34
Where did you hear that ? Stick with your BTC for 3 more years and you’ll use it in shops like everyday cash and it’ll be worth a shit load more than it is now

“He was also forced to transfer 100,000 South African Rand to his kidnapper’s bank account from his FNB account. “?????

There are no other institutions running physical future settlements currently ! Bakkt will be the first ! None of the other institutions physically hold bitcoin ! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:21:50
Any investor who thinks like this obviously only looks at technicals and not fundamentals ! Holy shit - Bakkt alone is going to push BTC price back over $5k almost immediately - so much happening for BTC and this Charlie has no idea !
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:12:04
