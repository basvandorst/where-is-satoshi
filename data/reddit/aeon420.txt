I was reading cointelegraph's article about Samourai wallet, but it says:
*" ... The PIN code and a secret GUID is stored locally in a secure space on a device."*
So to double check with you guys, the PIN is not stored on the device? If so, you should probably get them to review that part of the article, it'd be misleading lol
Keep up the good work!

Yes please do keep us updated! Bitcoin enthusiast based in Belfast here, I'm a Software Engineer / Web Developer, and would love to get involved in this.

I'm just gonna throw my 2 cent in here.
Found myself shouting at this video, this guy is complete ignorant towards the concept of bitcoin (Or chooses to be a coward about it). The fact I can scan a QR code and instantly send payment without sharing sensitive personal information (cc no., DOB, Address, etc.) with a 3rd party. Now thats way more secure IMO.
He has a nervous laugh during the video, and comes up with bullshit reasons why we shouldn't trust bitcoin. The attitude of "Anonymous Miners! SCARY SCARY SCARY" (I haven't even heard this apparent 'concern' until today) and "Oh bitcoin solves no problems for the consumer, so don't bother" is complete sensationalist tripe.
As a technology enthusiast and young father I bought some of my daughters Christmas gifts with the small amount of Bitcoin I had (which realistically,  i would have struggled this Xmas without), totally worth it. Being able to demonstrate the future of e-commerce to your family and friends really changes their perception of what is possible with Cryptocurrencies.
The suits sitting in the centralized payment providers (VISA, MasterCard, Paypal) should be afraid, because the future of worldwide payments isn't coming, its already here!

Yes you can! Head over to  (formerly pock.io) , go to "All Cards" and choose from their selection of vouchers which can be exchanged for bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). They have one for Amazon.co.uk .
I've used them a few times for Amazon UK vouchers,  had no problems. Great service.
