I heard the sound of a fedora rustling, undoubtably looking for an easy downvote, so I came running. Here have this upvote.

"You mean use the dollar to buy stock in bitcoin, right? So I should wait for the price of BTC to USD to fall again, right? Then I can use my cash to buy cheap bitcoins to use to buy Subway sandwiches. Because the price per bitcoins will be cheaper, I could get an expensive sub with *just one bitcoin* because the price is lower. And when I spend that bitcoin and eat the sandwich, I'll use the cash I saved by waiting for the price to drop to buy more bitcoins while the price is low! This future currency is genius! I can't lose!"

Yo, this guy is the real deal. He's going above and belong, combing Reddit for these complaints.

"I'm from St. Charles, MO." 
"Where the fuck is St. Charles, MO?"
"...It's...It's like a suburb of St. Louis."
I do this too when I'm traveling. And hell, I'm from WashMo. I guess not all of us can be from Clayton or Brentwood.

It's not a bad argument, it's an imperfect analogy. Voorhees definitely had a better one in his open letter. Analogies are notoriously obtuse in argumentation. One has to understand the parallels and differences and be able to clearly discern between the two situations in order for the analogy to work properly. In Voorhees' post, he used a concept as abstract as Bitcoin to convey his point, which was that the infrastructure of Bitcoin has value. Handsomechandler's used CD's as an analogy for Bitcoin's inherent value. This analogy falters from it's incompleteness.
In Voorhees post, we have: 
- English is to Bitcoin as literature (etc.) is to infrastructure.
- Bitcoin's (and English's) infrastructure is to Copycoin's (and English 2.0's) infrastructure as vast is to small.
- Vast is to more legitimate as small is to less legitimate. 
- Legitimacy is to inherent value as Bitcoin's infrastructure is to English literature. 
It's much harder for people to dismiss the inherent value English's vast adoption and infrastructure than it is for people to dismiss a non-physical representation of a currency. Especially when you say that the inherent value of said currency is based on it's utility, like digital music.

Doing it off the clock though. So there's that. It definitely does make the business look more caring and personable.

Yes. The same happened to me after selling a bit on that crazy Monday night. Funds were supposed to arrive yesterday, never did. Now the coins are back in my wallet with a new transaction, that is just a reverse of my original exchange.

I just did this the other night at a bar with four or five other guys. After giving out about $1.00, I got three drinks in return. I'm going to try to make this a weekly thing.

I like how people are downvoting you because you understand memes, re-Tweets, and Facebook Likes don't stop lobbyists. Wait. No I don't like that. I think that's stupid and wish more people understood that complaining online =/= viable protest. 
I just don't know what we can do. Does the mining community have any sway in this? Would this just effect purchases in the US? I'm woefully ignorant about this.

~~Bitcoin~~ zealots are as toxic ~~to this community~~ as ~~Bitcoin~~ haters.
I think this statement should be widely adopted. Bravo.

I don't have any experience with their support system. This is the first problem I've had with them. On their support FAQ page, they did have a message about Buy and Sell Delays. I'm not going to pretend that I understand what it says. I hope that they honor the original transaction though. I have a record of it taking place and the price at which I sold. I don't see a reason why they wouldn't honor it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:02:44








Yeah I see what you did there.
EDIT: I have no idea what I've done.

This thread just got 9000% sexier.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:03:07
I was being facetious. But your reply is nonetheless valid. Sorry if I sounded like a jerk :[
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:17:49
I've sent them an email about it. Haven't heard anything back. Just twiddling my thumbs now. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:49:25
Yeah damn that autocorrect. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:39:02
I think what OP and I experienced is a bit different. The coins didn't reappear in our wallets after a couple of days, but another transaction took place which re-bought the coins for the same amount they were sold for.

Actually [statistics show there was no significant increase of suicides in 1929.]( At least not enough to indicate a large amount of ruined Wall Street investors flung themselves from buildings. But that's neither here nor there.

Ok, Eric.

I too am in dire straits about this nonsense. I will have enough for rent and groceries this month if I could just get ahold of Coinbase. They're being *so lame*. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:56:58
What is an exchange and how do I get my coin there?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:13:54
Needs at least 20% more air horn at the end. Game Grumps would disapprove.
