Fuck you. What I said is true. I don't give a fuck if you looked through my posts. Fucking bitcoin loser.

Did you read his story? He's an idiot because he gave a stranger $20k, leased a spot to put the machine without any clause to have the machine installed and functioning, and then sent it back without any guarantee of a refund.  I won't even get into the whole "investing in Bitcoin" part of the stupidity. 
Get your head out of your ass. Take off your BTC colored glasses.  This guy really made a huge financial/business mistake. He is not in any situation to be running a business. Just spending family money as a hobby.

I mean, who would think its a good idea to buy a bitcoin atm?  You kinda walked right into that one. 
Regardless, for $15,000 I can get you out of this. Just pm me for details.

Wow. You're a complete idiot
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:23:26
You're fucking delusional

Can't believe I'm responding such an idiot. 
You know what they say about opinions...they're like assholes. everyone has them and they all stink. Just because you heard of a word and think it's ok doesn't meant it is. But if you want to use it and look like a fool, go right ahead. It shows a lack of command for the language and names you sound stupid. For gods sake, a fucking 8th grader used it in a poorly written essay about bitcoin mining. 
Fucking retard

Haha. You dumb fuck. Spoken like a true 8th grader

Firstly?  You need English lessons. 
Don't be an idiot. Mining is over the head of most adults. And you 500 word essay is very basic. The point of the assignment was to convey a relatively easy skill in an essay. You could write 10 pages on bitcoin mining and still not be finished. 
You missed the mark here and I would have given you a 0 also

Then maybe he should teach the class. You're a fucking retard

No they wouldn't. &amp;15-$20 is accurate

So if my employer starts paying with bitcoins, how do you determine what the salary is?  If I was hired a year ago, I might be paid 100 bitcoins a week. But then someone hired last week makes 2 bitcoins a week. Am I still making 100 btc/week? How does my employer afford this?  When bitcoins go back down to $1 each, does the new employee still make 2 btc/week?
The point is that bitcoin will never be anything other than an investment. It will not become a mainstream currency. It can't.

You're either really young or really dumb.

Just because you looked in a dictionary and found it doesn't mean it's correct. It's not correct to use firstly. First and second are perfectly good adverbs. For enumerating points in a essay, "firstly" and "secondly" are unnecessary and stylistically unattractive. 
You'll understand once you learn more about language and how to write essays.

Ha. Sucker

It's funny how you guys think bitcoin will actually stick around for a while
