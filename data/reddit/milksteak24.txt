1 bitcoin at a time?  Would that be best or would you just want to do it all at once?

Hate it when that happens. 
Just the other day, I went to buy a few litecoin and accidentally took the natural logarithm of the amount I meant to type

Judging by the initial post, she is not only taken, but also a lesbian.  And according to her profile, she is in Japan.  
Best of luck though

Looks like some big ballers are buying in.  Either billionaires or banks.  Transactions as big as 14 400 btc are taking place

Oh fair enough.  I remember I was on r/bitcoin once and I referred to the “hodl guy” and 2 different people corrected me and told me it was a girl, so I just assumed they knew better

I heard about bitcoin in 2015.  Did a 2 minute google search and brushed it off cause I didn’t really understand it.
The price now is almost 100x what it was then...

If you consider all miners to be a homogeneous governing body then I suppose you could consider it a fiat currency, but that’s a stretch. 
And it could exceed its aim.

Pffft I’m not selling ever.  Why would I sell my bitcoin for fiat currency which is going to be outdated and worthless by 2035?

There’s a bot that takes any 19 syllable comment and turns it into a haiku basically.  
Everyone is saying the comment was removed by mods but I can see it now so maybe they “un-removed” it
