This is how internet of value works. You can build any type of app that needs digital scarcity, and you can back the value of a digital good with bitcoin security.
You only need one 'killer app' for bitcoin to enter the trillion $ market cap.

It will be the most secure.

No other blockchain will be able to compete with the network effect of a global currency.
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:06:59
No directly. They will use counterparty to issue game tokens. Each time counterparty token is moved, bitcoin fee must be paid because bitcoin is providing the underlying security.
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:42:12


As long as it cheaper and more convenient to operate with one currency, the path of least resistance will win.
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:34:24
Bitcoin will become a settlement layer. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 05:39:36
There will be only one global currency. It could be bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-22 05:43:06
There will always be fees and added inconvenience.
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:42:40


Counterparty will be used for in-game currencies.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:54:39
Sure it is, security and money go hand and hand. It is also less convenient and more expensive to switch networks. If everything can be done on top of one network, in one place, in one wallet, then people in general will stick to one network, that is trusted, convenient and most secure. The market chooses the path of least resistance.

Yes, smart contracts running on counterparty are the next step, it would be interesting to see how it will influence future gaming.
In game smart contracts opens the door to a decentralized VR, where people from all over the world are able to find work (creating digital items for example) in a game like environment.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:37:17
There will be no actual need or desire to switch to a less secure/popular network for the majority of people.
@_date: 2016-08-21 08:00:18
It isn't flexible enough.
@_date: 2016-08-21 07:58:05


It will be much faster than that. Considering how much unemployment there will be just from self driving cars, online micro tasks will be a life saver for millions.

This is simply not true, you will be able to achieve greater security building on top of bitcoin.

Mentioning other low value/low security blockchains as an example for some kind of a marketing strategy for bitcoin is as ridiculous as saying that using skateboards will increase tesla market share.

When you can take away humans completely out of the equation, all becomes operating cost. 
A way to simplify it:
Machines (software + hardware) = Operating cost
Humans + Machines (software + hardware) = Profit + Operating cost
In the end people will not need the middle man.

Here is something 'crazy' for you to consider.
Cross game item trading on counterparty DEX and smart contracts will lead the way to complex gaming.
Complex gaming is when your actions in one game influence other games. You'll be able to play several games simultaneously.
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:26:20
All other competing blockchain projects reduce the network effect of bitcoin and have lesser security.
Counterparty increases the network effect of bitcoin by providing bitcoin with additional utility (tokenization of digital commodities being a major one).
@_date: 2016-08-21 08:44:08


Correct. True internet of value can't have restrictions.
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:32:52


This will happen gradually as I explained in the post. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:28:36
Considering how much energy millions of people invest in games, it is reasonable to expect that people will prefer to play games that allow them to own and trade the items they earn.
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:35:28
There is no reason not to use a currency as regular money and use a different type of crypto for smart contracts. This will just create unnecessary complexity which the market will go against sooner than later.
The path of the least resistance always wins. The crypto that provides what the market needs will win and will be used for ordinary transactions as well as store of value.

Bitcoin is a settlement layer, there will be no problem to use LN in counterparty, they are actually planning to implement micropayments it as we speak.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:04:01
All other blockchain projects compete with bitcoin and reduce the network effect of bitcoin - not so with assets that are created on counterparty which **must** use bitcoin in order to exist.
Storj uses counterparty, which increases the value of bitcoin by providing it with additional utility, all other networks undermine bitcoin by introducing other blockchains.
@_date: 2016-08-13 06:56:22

There is nothing despite about it, Bitcoin was burned to create counterparty gas. This is not a pre-mined scam as some might think.
Rootstcok is a centralized sidechain. Sidechains are insecure compared to bitcoin and other competing blockchains.
Counterparty is as secure as bitcoin, and you need to use bitcoin to move counterparty assets. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 02:33:27
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:15:47
To move and create assets you need to pay in bitcoin. The success of counterparty will increase the survival chance of bitcoin against ethereum and others. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:35:50
The reality is currently it is hard to use bitcoin and almost no incentive to use as money for most people, there are edge cases but on the grand scheme of things bitcoin still lacks mainstream use cases.
Doesn't mean something won't come up that regular money won't be able to compete against, for example, machine to machine value transfer. 
With bitcoin machines are able to have access to money and use it, machines will still have to have a mechanism for resource allocation, and with payment channels that will hopefully unlock instant robust micro transactions, machines will be able to transfer resources in the most cheapest and efficient way possible.
@_date: 2016-06-09 10:38:27


Counterparty is a scarce resource that you can buy, at the start everyone burned bitcoin to get tokens at very high risk. This is as fair as you can get. 


You can't easily duplicate the network effect.


No, this is not why bitcoin is valuable, the issuance schedule hardly matters, it is arbitrary. The value of a scarce resource is derived from the utility it provides.
Sidechains will always be less secure than the main chain simply by design. Why would anyone put their money in less secure environment. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 12:33:41
That is fine. 
I still think that it is really important to understand the nature of the disagreement and why compromise is impossible. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 07:06:27
Counterparty has ethereum smart contracts enabled on the test net as promised.
It was decided not to integrate it on the mainnet because there is too much uncertainty about vulnerabilities to attacks. 
The conclusion is that the safest way to move forward is to continue to use Counterparty Improvement Proposals and add new features when needed:
You can read about this in the last update.
@_date: 2016-09-05 19:54:13
All operations are done on bitcoin blockchain.
"BTCPAYmarket.com utilizes the Counterparty DEX (decentralized exchange). This site does not maintain any databases and all information is queried from publicly available block chain APIs."
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:59:39
Everything worth having will eventually be integrated into the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:02:40
But who will secure the network if there is no reward to do so. Scarcity by itself will not increase value. The security of bitcoin is based upon the assumption that the market cap will increase in the future. If it doesn't happen, inflation must be introduced. 
If inflation is introduced it will destroy the fundamentals. 
Future security of bitcoin made upon the assumption of increased market cap. This has nothing to do with tech, this is an economic argument. 
You can't predict the market.
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:11:48
Are you saying that the future security of bitcoin is totally depended on market speculation?
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:28:27
You haven't seen nothing yet. 
Counterparty is the most impressive crypto project today.
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:06:18
Well if you want a robust network that remains somewhat decentralized than you will have to accept that most of the transactions will happen of chain. Fees are reduced because bitcoin becomes a settlement layer rather than a payment network.
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:01:21
Rootstock is a centralized sidechain, it does not, and will not have the bitcoin security that is backing counterparty.

@_date: 2016-07-21 07:50:29
This is one of the ways smart contracts will be used in the near future. This is the start of the new economy. 
Let me repeat my other post.
The new economy, where machines can operate autonomously and transfer value between themselves, is only achievable using smart contracts.
According to Cisco the internet of everything has a $19 trillion potential.
Why would anyone use anything other than bitcoin blockchain including sidechains. Why would anyone put their money in a less secure blockchain, or a centralized more expensive solution that no one can trust.
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:02:00
The logical conclusion is AGI, but then we will not need money anyhow.
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:55:02
You will be able to rent, trade and split ownership on the most secure blockchain, bitcoin blockchain.
All **things** will be represented by assets, which will be created on the most trusted and secure platform - Counterparty.
On the counterpary platform contracts will be made between people that don't know each other, between machines and people and between machines.  All of it will provide additional value to bitcoin, because bitcoin must be used to transfer value on the counterparty platform in order to secure it.
Using tech such as LN, payments will be secure, fast, cheap, global and without paying any third party for handling the transactions.
Bitcoin is the base layer, more additional layers built on top of it,  each layer will increase the network effect of bitcoin, which will increase the value of bitcoin, and get it closer to becoming a global most stable, trusted and secure currency.

It is irrational  for you to retain ownership where the cheaper version is operating and undercutting you. It will be more expensive, a burden to own an older car because no one will rent it, and you will still be responsible for it, will have to pay for the maintenance. 
Owning will be more expensive than not owning.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:03:46
Rootstock is centralized, and less secure by design. Anything that is not built on top of bitcoin blockchain will be weeded out, because bitcoin offers the greatest security. It will be highly irrational to place your money in less secure environment including ethereum.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:47:41


Because it will be less profitable to sell for parts, than to make the car self owning in the end.
You need to think on a larger scale, and the market of billions of people on the planet.
The idea of autonomous corporation, and how it will operate on zero profit. The manufacturer will have bigger profit by selling it to a autonomous corporation rather than selling it for parts.
The car is self owning as in not operated by humans that can withdraw value in less efficient manner than a computer software.
There will be no profit only operating cost.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:48:45
This is the first step towards autonomous self-owning machines.
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:55:59
Thanks, that was just an example to illustrate the potential. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:42:24
I did mention a concept for a new economy here:
It does lead to a logical conclusion.
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:28:54


Manufacturer produces a car, at first the car pays the manufacturer the necessary fees, so the manufacturer can profit in order to continue to produce more cars.
Because there will always be some people that prefer to pay a little extra to ride a new car, it will enable the new cars to pay the manufacturer fee in order to become financially autonomous in the future.
When fees are payed in full by the consumers, the car is then begins to own itself, can rent itself for the highest bidder.
The same model can scale to factories and if you want to go a step further to smart cities.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:12:33


Except that every single thing, including cars, will be registered on the blockchain, assigned an asset, and will have the market value drop, have the drivers reputation hurt and licence revoked, if one participates in this type of behavior.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:31:03
Machines will own themselves and you will only pay for operating cost, no company will be able to compete with autonomous self-owning machines.
@_date: 2016-07-21 10:59:03
I don't think smart contracts need to be sold, as they will 'sell' themselves, because of the value they will bring to most people in the future.
With the invention of of smart contracts, it means that machines can transact between themselves, they can own a wallet, they can pay money to other machines for services, they can rent themselves for the highest bidder. 
For example if a car owns itself, you, the consumer, will only have to pay for the operating costs of the car.
No middle man will take a cut for the service, you will get all the benefits of owning a car without the burdens that come with it.
No centralized service will be able to compete with a decentralized network. Bitcoin, and counterparty platform that runs the asset and smart contracts on top of it, will always be cheaper and more secure than any other competing blockchain or a centralized service. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:44:29
You will be able to order anything you like, as fast as possible. Just place an order from the self owning autonomous 3D printing factory and the product of the highest quality and at the cheapest price possible will be delivered to your door step.
If you consider AR potential, where you will be able to stand in front of a mirror, look for clothes, make sure it fits and and matches your taste, order the design from you favorite designer from all over the world via smart contract, and order it to be printed as soon as possible from the factory near you.
I know, too many buzz words, but this is how the near future sounds like.

In that comment I wrote: Why would anyone use anything other than bitcoin blockchain including sidechains.
By "including sidechains" I mean "other than bitcoin blockchain".
I'm consistent in my view.
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:35:44
"The included P2SH capabilities enable support in Counterparty for multisig addresses (which start with a ‘3’), as **well as opening the door to the release of payment channels (micropayments) and Lightning Network capabilities.**"
So I guess the whole 'bitcoin is a steam engine', ethereum is a rocket engine argument is thrown out of the window then.
Counterparty is backed by the most secured blockchain, when value is transferred on Counterparty, Bitcoin must be used for fees. The more use cases Bitcoin has, the higher the value it has.
The new economy, where machines can operate autonomously and transfer value between themselves, is only achievable using smart contracts.
According to Cisco the internet of everything has a $19 trillion potential. 
Why would anyone use anything other than bitcoin blockchain including sidechains. Why would anyone put their money in a less secure blockchain, or a centralized more expensive solution that no one can trust.

Autonomous self-owning cars will not be designed like regular cars at all.
They will look like pods probably.
It will be very hard to 'misbehave' within the car, as it will be designed especially for this kind of service.

Most will probably earn money by providing their attention. Being willing to listen to ideas and participate in VR of some sort.
I think a lot of people are creative, they just don't have the skills to express themselves.
This is why I mentioned future jobs that will be about creating tools that can minimize the lag time between imagination and reality.
Essentially people will not need to learn skills to express what is inside their minds, the lag time between the imagination and reality will be minimized greatly.
For example:

Because other manufacturers will undermine him by taking the route that will provide greater profit. 
Consumer will always seek the cheaper option, when you have a car that becomes less expensive the older it becomes, and a car that maintains the same price throughout, the consumer will go for the cheaper option.

People worry about automation, they think there will be no jobs in the future.
Jobs will move into creative domain.
Creativity, imagination and attention will be extremely valuable.
The maintenance of our biological existence will be cheap, because of how resources will be managed by machines.
Most of our time will be spent in VR. Work will become play. Money will be a way to manage attention of others, because attention is a scarce resource.
Propagation of information, or culture, will have a price tag.
If one wishes to advertise their ideas and values, one will have to pay directly for attention.
The way I see it, the new dynamic will be that of creating of ideas, designing VR/AR, being payed for creativity, being payed to create tools that can minimize the lag time between imagination and reality, and being payed for attention, to listen to the ideas, to participate in different worlds - to play.

Might happen with bitcoin too:
