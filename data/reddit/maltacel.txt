If you have direct access to bitcoin it is usually more cost effective than futures. An exception to this being how certain countries treat bitcoin trading vs 'paper' bitcoin trading with regard to tax.

Ok idiots. Please do not go dropping your lives savings or rent money into bitcoin thinking it will go to “100,000!” like some have said. It will never reach 20,000 again, ever, and it has just bounced to 5,900 (6k) like I and many others have predicted it would bounce after the (also predicted) collapse. I mainly trade Forex and commodities but I have analyzed bitcoin after seeing so much wishful thinking while it was going up and then despair as it collapsed in these subs, and the sob stories that followed. Fundamentally it can never become a “new currency”, the technology can become adopted, but never bitcoin actual. In fact banks have started to buy into the tech, so I would say bitcoin will collapse back down to its marginal usage price level (the price that can be sustained due to usage) and leave its speculative inflated price behind forever. I’m not sure exactly what price the demand price would be, I’d say about 6-8k again. But never 20,000. Specially since more regulations and limitations will begin to be pushed by governments on bitcoin and other crypto usage, not less. Burn this into your memory even if it makes you angry and you’ll thank me later.
Edit: oh nooo all the tears. Cry more. I mean, more than you already did when your bitcoin delusion popped. Same reaponses too, almost to the letter. Yea I’m pretty hostile now, but when I started nicely warning you people all I got was the same hostility. Now I just rejoice in your tears as I told you so. You people are the joke of all that is trading. Maybe listen for once and you won’t fill reddit with sob stories haha.
