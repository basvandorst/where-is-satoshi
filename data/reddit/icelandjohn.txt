Hearn went to work for banks - R3. He sold his soul. Did he have to write this nasty letter of lies ? Of course NOT. He did it on purpose and specifically to bring a rift. What he does not understand that Open Source Projects DO NOT FAIL. WE PREVAIL. BANKS and CLOSE SYSTEMS WILL FAIL. THE Future is BITCOIN !

PS for all the idiots that think BitFury is a Russian company I have some news to all the ignoramuses our there - one founder is Latvian; the other is Ukrainian. There is no key member of the team who is Russian! Scores of Europeans and Americans, including ex Department Justice head of CyberCrime and Organized Crime; ex Chair of CFTC and head of NYMEX; President of Samsung; ex CFO of Verifone and Symantec .. Its the largest Western company that has emerged as clear winner

its a smart scammer. do I have to hand over 75 prc to 21 to be scammed or I keep 100 prc.. in either case its a scam. I can get rasberry pi on ebay for $30 or get a spondoolies or S7 and make 2-3X. 21 just scammed VCs out of money. Well done guys.. Keep on burning that cash !

Balajio the clownster as you are referred - phps the first 200 peopel you dupped into buying the $399 for raspberry pi (base price $5) but dupping Google to get on your network ? :) LOL .. best you ask QCOM - they seem to have enough capital to wash down toilet on your ideas.. you lost $50 mln last year of investor money.. this year = $100 mln ? You ready for another pivot from the pivot ?

very smart lady 
@_date: 2015-11-28 19:03:16

$399 for a $5 rsp pi - is as close as to selling air as they come. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 18:57:50
the hoax of the hoax.. $5 Rsp Pi for $399 and 75 prc profits to the "creators" of biggest scam in silicon valley .. thanlk you com, yuan, rre and AH

21 used to have 6 prc market share now they are down to 3! Chinese are killing it and guess what if the $400 raspberry pi idea starts moving, the Chinese will copy it as well and do it 5x cheaper. Great to have so many fool VCs and angels giving money to these clowns! LOL.

Spoondolies has enough money and/or credibility left to deploy 10 PH max. Too late with chip and lacks scale. They are toast. Bitfury on the other hand is killin it …  with 40MW = 200 PH ; with 100 MW = 500 PH And from what I see the DC is all but built and deployment start soon. They have 15 prc market share NOW .. where will they go next ??? End of decentralization ?
