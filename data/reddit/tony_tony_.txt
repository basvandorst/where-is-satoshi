yes, banks have no interest whatsoever in laundering proceeds from illicit activity. wink.
@_date: 2016-03-09 02:31:33
Again, the fact that a few individuals may have utilized a free centralized service proves no point of yours. Redundant and useless.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:44:03
That's a nice feature you're proposing, i'm sure many will agree a nice UI is a key feature of a good wallet. but since you say it already exists wit ha few implementations I'm not sure where else this conversation can go. seems to me you've got nothing better to do with your time.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:23:30
of what?
mass adoption in general? 
it's relative to the medium and tech being discussed. this does not refute my point whatsoever.
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:54:57
don't count if a majority of the are hosted on AWS.
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:29:42
that all is just unsubstantiated accusations and opinion disguised as facts. it reads to me like he is the immature one with a lack of communications skills.
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:06:49
either way i don't think there is any need to rush. i think in part this is a manufactured crisis, and in part stemming from the technology's immense popularity. i don't really care about the fictional individual who has been disillusioned by long confirmation times. i've had to wait unreasonable long for a confirmation before, but funny enough, none of my recent transactions have had this problem. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:38:04
That's the joke. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 02:25:29
I think it's silly and childish and very disingenuous to feign ignorance of the fact these redundant instances come at no cost. Hosting even a VM doesn't readily come cheap. I pay for my VPS  and the VMs running on the servers in my house are budgeted into my electricity usage. There are many ways to inflate node count I'm sure, but your strawman argument proves no point.
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:57:59
Redundant localized service. What point does this prove? Might be a good service for general hosting but does nothing to to further the goal of decentralization.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:12:27
you mean 0.39% them? i don't think much of it at all. better than nothing i guess.
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:29:44
well what's the point of attacking if you're not even going to attempt to fill the blocks? i don't think you understand your own point.
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:49:45
insignificant either way.
please refer me to @_date: 2016-03-01 20:06:49
while i love to procrastinate on here and waste time at least I'm not blindly refuting my own arguments one sentence to another. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:50:04
we're talking about a technology to replace the world's financial order, not an iphone app.
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:41:33
Good for you. I don't much care for anonymous internet commenters either.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:01:32
i made the same mistake when i first got some coins years back, sending a couple of bucks with a low fee to Satoshi dice. i didn't come here crying about it. this is not a new phenomenon.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:02:25
ha what sort of lame accusation is that? who says blog posts are just opinion? don't be ridiculous. maybe most of them in general, but i think they can be much more, don't be so narrow minded. and while he prefaces this as his opinion, he writes that developers have been scared away. that cannot be opinion. either they have or they haven't, reference please. how does this put bitcoin at risk, and how exactly have you come to the conclusion that they are immature? unsubstantiated inflammatory accusation, more references please. childish drivel, now i'll wait for you to accuse me of the same.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:07:02
you should find someone who knows about the subject to expain it to your dad.
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:15:03
bitcoin is not food. you can't argue with that. you seem desperate for an argument. while bitcoin is not food it is a immutable record and assuming the network was robust it would hold value against hard goods if not the USD. there is value in a medium of exchange and as history has shown a token of value always predates agriculture.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:46:52
i didn't make a small fortune by listening to internet comments.
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:53:00
Well I'm glad you were able to sift though the shit you pulled from your ass.
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:16:25
the only point of hosting more than node on there would be to inflate node count. the is no other benefit on hosting many redundant instances on one centralized service. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:43:33
there's nothing to say. business as usual.
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:39:27
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:09:28
so what is so important about this four cent transaction that it needs to be processed immediately and discussed in a a public forum. are you really feeling punished over the few pennies you sent? bullshit.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:23:27
It tells me i love FUD.
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:58:10
"bread will have no value once the USD tanks. How will you buy the yeast and the wheat?!"
i deleted the comment cause i didn't and some troll argument but this then i find this deliciously stupid reply.
you're an idiot. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:39:54
Couldn't you say the intent was to let the code govern the rules? Wasn't that the point of the experiment. Sure no one wanted to see it exploited in this way, but that's irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:58:02
my dollar savings lost 30% of their purchasing power this year, should I have been warned about holding dollars?
my bitcoin doubled in value in the same amount of time.

'Money can be used to exchange goods and services. If there are no goods, how can I spend my money?'
What an insight!
If you'd like to know more about financial fraud talk to the drug money launderers over at HSBC. Fraud here doesn't amount to shit, and if you're stupid enough to put your money in DAO or paycoin, etc you don't deserve to keep your money. And if you're suggesting bitfinex's downtime amounts to fraud, like others have suggested, call the SEC.
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:26:13
it *is* trivial compared to the capacity increases proposed by current development goals. you seem to know nothing about ongoing development yet managed to for some sort of nonsensical opinion about it.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:18:45
there's probably a lot of overlap.
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:09:38
that's some pretty transparent concern trolling.
'hey guys, how about this well researched and thoroughly discussed topic that i could easily find the answer for by searching? let beat this dead horse a little longer. full disclosure i've already made my mind up about the topic, here is a 48:00 minute video of a self promoting know-nothing douche.'
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:03:39
why another discussion? i'm sure you can't wait to tell me about the evil cabal behind the lightning network. you seemed to feign ignorance on segwit development in your rant, but now are fully aware, so surprise. you'll be enlightened by the fact that segwit allows for double the capacity increases in contrast to your tired argument. you'll find the rest of the development goals on the core website, and yes, lightning network is one among many. did i say a bad word?
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:30:47
usually questions end with question marks. this is uninformed opinion veiled as constructive concern. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:45:50
a quick look at 21.co shows txs stuck in the mempool to have paid in the range of 10-50 sat/byte so yes i think this is spam. i pay at least 70 sat/byte even when there's no mempool backlog and i expect to wait an hour for a couple of confirmations, the estimates on 21.co show a reasonable confitation time for txs in that range.

go to the atm, realize you can't use it. try to buy food with the few bills you have in your pocket before you quickly realize no one will part with food for paper that won't burn. 
when i was growing up people illegally imported gasoline, traded homegrown foods, livestock, tabacco. nobody used cash, and if they did it was quickly exchanged into german marks imported by your moneychanging uncle.
@_date: 2016-06-18 05:04:54
The block are perpetually full and no one actually uses it. Doomed to fail.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:36:37
yes, we all know hitler invenvted the concept of technology and jump started the industrial revolution. for someone who is eager to critisize dumb logic you don't seem to think things through. hitler didn't invent technology but roger *is* responsible for the voice given to thoughtless big blockers.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:13:27
wut? it is aparent you pulled this ancecdute straight from your ass as you seem to have a fundemantal misunderstanding of how wallets work. tell me, what business do you have hanging around the ATM with them for twenty minues? you're telling us you watched them for twenty minutes straight to prove your point online? 
and twenty minutes is just two blocks on average, this is not long to have to wait for a confirmation. another gross misunderstanding on your part.
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:59:24
Can't wait for the fork once that fails. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 06:08:09
You can't be serious. This is not an iPhone app, this is a worldwide permissionless ledger. There is no room for mistakes, everything has to be very carefully considered and tested, there can be no unforseen consequences. If you want to experiment with some shitcoin that's your business and your shitty investment.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:27:00
while our interests are aligned, i have issues with China being posed always as an inherent threat, and I am highly suspicious of anyone coming here with the idea of a solution to fix it. especially a three month old account promoting a self proclaimed expert's video. but i shouldn't be so quick to judge i guess.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:37:57
A quick look at your profile and I find you comparing a block to a size of a gif. Its clear you have little understanding of what makes up a transaction. A centralized service might be great at tweeing out 3mb gifs but its not the job of a decentralized block chain.
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:57:51
That's funny. I have a very similar unsubstantiated anecdote. My transaction went through just fine though.
@_date: 2016-12-09 02:02:16
Its cute you think your dinky startup experience has any relevance here. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:40:50
I don't doubt he would do so to save his overinflated ego just to say I told you so. Who else would gladly accept the nickname Bitcoin Jesus other than an egomaniac.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:30:35
are you under the impression that miners are keeping block small because they want more fees? while a block increase is a band aid solution it allows for an increase txs and fees. i am afraid you're delusional if youre saying that they shouldn't act in thier financial self interest. if you actually read the papers you would know bitcoin is based on a trust that all individual participants will act in ther financial self interest.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:20:26
i'm not sure how you managed to misinterpret your own metaphor. while he *is* responsible for the propoganda pertaining to big blocks your metaphor here pertains to altcoins not big blocks. your exeptional logic seems to have gotten muddied. point here is that roger *is* resposible for the creation and promotion of many pump and dump altcoins, he actively promotes this while shittng on bitcoin, this is his business model. and if BU is your bag you share resposibility for FUD and ignorance when it comes to big blocks. paypay 2.0 my ass. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:33:13
ok, imagine now that the cluster of 40 servers were each contolled by a different entity each with differing visions for the software. this isn't amateur hour at your startup. your run of the mill product in no way compares to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:05:09
one shitposter was actually convinced it was natural growth. fifty thousand low fee transaction is natural growth? i can't help but cringe with embrassment for them and thier stupidity.

just ask the ETH devs how successful thier rollback was. the future of cyptocurrency, i'm sure.

The Spanish are going to be real butthurt if EU leaders let Ireland and Scotland join independently of the UK. Anything that gives legitimacy to Catalan independence in the eyes of the Spanish leadership will be opposed. I don't think it's going to be very straightforward, and I think Ireland and Scotland are stuck with the consequences of the majority decision.
