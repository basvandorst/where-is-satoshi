It sounds like a system hack rather than account hack. 2fa is useless if you have access to a hot wallet

$3,000 - $7,000, the window is closing for the average person to own a whole bitcoin

arguably, if we knew the number of lost coins then the value of each bitcoin should be adjusted upwards
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:06:40

An internet relay node could be a good interim solution to bridge all connections. It would also be beneficial in isolated groups of people.
