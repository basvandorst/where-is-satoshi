Sorry, I typed the original comment up at work. 6 years ago*** The fact that you ignored the substance of my comment just further illuminates the amount of ignorance and arrogance in this market. People like you are the reason that I've traded this market profitably for over 4 years.

It's all about increasing BTC ratio. Why trade alts if they're almost all in a downtrend when charted against BTC? Wait for confirmation of a breakout on the Alt/BTC chart and then you can have yourself a nice altcoin boogaloo. Until then, hold BTC. Trump isn't talking about altcoins, the FED basically ignores their existence entirely, and Congress literally called them shitcoins. Fundamentals and use cases aside, all of the market attention is on Bitcoin.

You guys are paying way too much attention to the numerical value itself and ignoring bitcoin's growth as viewed on a logarithmic chart. Rewind 4 or 5 years and it seemed just as unfeasible for bitcoin to hit $1,000-$5,000, let alone the ATH of roughly $20,000 (depending on exchange). Imagine if someone in 2010 said that bitcoin would go from a few cents to five figures in less than a decade. Perspective is everything in a nascent market like this one.

Unless the basic tenets of economics (supply and demand) somehow disappear, the price will continue to climb. It's impossible predict the exact increase, which is why trend lines exist. They're not perfect though, which makes the title a bit misleading. For the sake of a thought experiment, please consider a group of resources and their respective scarcity. You'll find that any resource in existence has a potentially unlimited quantity, given both the growing size of the universe and our increased efficiency when it comes to processing raw materials. BTC on the other hand, has a predetermined maximum supply. The significance of this one trait, alone makes bitcoin the best store of value that human kind has ever conceived. Feel free to screenshot or save my comment and come look at it in a few years. You'll either thank me or hate me. Choice is yours.

The point is that your gambling low volume garbage, which is basically equivalent to slots. Good luck losing your BTC ratio, brother.
