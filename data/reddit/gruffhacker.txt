Cute. But we all know that socialists are masters of the no true scotsman fallacy. If only Marxist doctrine is allowed to be called socialism then no government will ever live up to it. We will be forever locked in the cycle of Attempt Socialism &gt; Fail &gt; Deny it was socialism because it did not meet Marxist rule 123.4b.
Chavez certainly believed he was pursuing socialism:

You may not have written it but it's a terrible definition on Wikipedia. The citations for the terms you use are from socialist activist source material rather than any attempt at a neutral definition. Even dictionaries are a better source here.
Socialism is about state control of economic power / means of production / resources and you can't leave that element out of any reasonable definition. If nothing else it is a required element to enforce control of those resources by the people at large.
You are likely correct about Venezuela having devolved into a fascist state today, but it got there because the socialists seized control of the economy and the state started making awful decisions leading to a downward spiral.

I’m quite interested in 100 years of results of Marxist theory all around the globe. The mass murder and starvation and suffering has been very impressive. I’m just not interested in going over their rhetoric again.

If you just go making up your own definitions to established words then language loses any meaning. Venezuela has undoubtedly been socialist since Chavez took power and the country has collapsed due to their own economic policies.

I’m not interested in the slightest in the failed Marxist definitions.
Venezuela’s situation was certainly exacerbated by Dutch disease but it’s nowhere close to the cause. Chavez’s socialist revolution seized the oil companies for the people and production has collapsed due to the states’s incompetence and graft. Maduro has thrown gasoline onto the fire with wage and price controls and now Venezuela is another failed state with millions of refugees and starving citizens.

You can quote it, but it's still wrong. I recommend you read all the citations for that sentence and you'll find that it heavily uses biased language rather than the more neutral and more frequently used term of "state ownership."
