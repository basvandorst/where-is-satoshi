I gotta disagree too because the ETH and ADA crowds brag about how advanced their coins are. Metric are metrics unfortunately and price, speed, etc all are fair game.  We just have to appreciate the journey thus far and hope for some good luck with the LN to help resolve some of these barriers.

Any update?
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:50:01
Or in under 1k and out at over 10k. Made a killing and am waiting for it to sink a bit more before jumping in again :)
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:20:49
This is a big concern of mine. I made a lot on BCH but now look at it. Scary stuff
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:20:08
I've lost just over a full coin myself. I had no clue it would become what it is today :( I sold off but am trying to get into a buying position again.

What are the advantages of those wallets over coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:37:51
I hear that. I've been lucky so far, sold my eth and litecoin while they were high and put it into btc. It's soaring, but I'm really starting to see the point bch guys are making. Considering going 50/50 soon. Gotta think a bit more about it though
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:00:54

Yep. Even with my benign comment, I'm being down voted lol
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:53:10
Ya, I sold over 10k as shit was falling apart and people told me i was an idiot "cuz they had contacts in China".  I still don't think we've seen the real low yet.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:43:43
Same here
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:58:59
As someone who lost a Bitcoin and a half, i agree
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:12:31
This is exactly what I was telling a friend. Everyone else would go alt mostly because they are far too late to have a decent exchange rate. It's scary me a bit but i keep hodl-ing on
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:54:03
I totally agree with you, I think that's about where the bottom is and then we will have a much more gradual and appropriate rise over the next few years.

You forgot to address that it's also wisdom. He is so wise and is graciously letting us all know that so we can become his flock. Such a kind prophet.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:15:04
I really like this because, while I do think it will both sink as well as skyrocket (unsure of the order), you are prepared for the ride despite the naysayers.  Bottom line is that this is a risk we are all partaking in. If you can or want to go big and can comfortably afford it, it's a WAY better choice than a car as you mentioned.  Good luck man, hope to be dropping a few thousands more in myself (dumping the wife's commission checks into it, she doesn't know my plan yet lol)
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:59:43
I lost one and a half myself :(

Viewing this on my home network "additional pylons" ("you must construct" is upstairs). Thank you lol

If he is buying and selling, then he would've been better off holding until now. Imagine all the fees he's said and growth he's missed when not invested. Basically he's saying that he believes it will go bust yet he invested anyway. There's no way he's made more than people who have just held this hold time we make if they chose to sell now. Me personally, I'm still investing!
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:50:33
If it goes to 100,000 I'll give it my whole back as a canvas.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:55:40
Gotcha, looking busy instead of making money. Sorry, I know nothing of investments

How did the trezor fail?
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:09:07
How? It's exploded in the past couple months, any details on your purchase price? Did fees or something play a part?
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:07:20
RemindMe! 6 months Borrowed 30k from bank
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:44:44
Agreed, it took a massive country to "ban" it to knock it down a couple grand for a moment. At 4.2k I wanted it to dip back down a bit to buy more, but at this point I don't see that happening. I bought more around 5.

OP sounds young. Doesn't understand the FDIC's purpose at all. He's a hardcore Bitcoin fanboy which is cool, just awfully narrow-minded. Crypto currency will have it's place in the future, but his attitude actually hurts progress more than it helps.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:00:29
I don't see the point of this. This generic story doesn't really shed any new light on anything.  And you're citing the white paper which Bitcoin has moved away from.
You'll always pretty much have some type of local currency and it's local institutions for non adopters. Bitcoin just gives us the freedom of a global alternative.

So I think it's pretty well known that when the personal attacks come, especially sifting through accounts or comments about spelling or grammer, that clearly someone has no better arguments to make.
