there's a lot an exchange can do by batching transactions as well. Segwit can cause a whole slew of support issues even if implemented correctly
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:53:14
err... they do have limit orders for closing positions
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:37:01
Nah Canadian, 
I'm Alex, the guy in the middle hosting.

It's not a central censorship, it allows self-governance by creating lists of bad actors. If you start being a cunt, everyone will ignore you.

Bittrex could be described as the best online wallet with a market built in. They have many automated systems to protect the overall exchange from individual chain failures by automatically disabling markets which is the problem cryptsy claims to be facing in regards to withdrawals.
I've had many interactions with both Bill and Richie about expanding in a regulated and controlled manner, and their forethought in planning and operating their exchange is astounding.
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:51:42
when bitcoin starting getting its big boy pants and getting regulations. This lead to several questionable companies finally getting the boi

You spend the money on the ring you dipstick

big deal, I've been giving sterkcoins to 5th graders for years

One computer, one vote. If you can't afford to take a loss, then you probably won't be voting long. Satoshi knew more than we can comprehend.
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:52:35
3 million bits seems affordable for a villa, especially in this market. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:15:53
New letter that when out
"All of our BTM’s are connected to our exchange so you can be sure you will be getting the best price from Canada’s largest and most liquid Bitcoin exchange"
not sure if theres a service fee but there exchange price is usually 10$ lower then bitcoinaverage
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:22:36
Looks like someone made the same mistake last month with 3.75 Bitcoin.

Hey guys, Alex here. Host of Decentral's  show. We have an awesome show friday night [here](
Check out our [youtube channel]( where we have awesome live shows with Andreas, Peter Todd, BitSim and many others.
Or [meetup]( to be part of the audience.
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:06:27
So to say they've made nothing is incorrect, yes the day trade flash in the pan alts are only a couple hundred in profit. That's money you didn't have before! I do the show to help validate lasting projects as well, ArchCoin being the best investment so far. If your in bitcoin to make 10x or 100x, thats a long ways off, but getting 10x on 3000$ in Arch is not uncommon with several other alts
@_date: 2014-08-29 13:04:29
I wonder if you get the same amount or the same value back
@_date: 2014-08-10 03:44:49
Just wait till Black Friday, cyber Monday, and all the other online sales in regards to the coming holiday season
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:31:34
Get outta here with all that logic nonsense
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:40:50
What have you based this on?
@_date: 2014-09-25 16:27:46
Dynamic POS coming soon!
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:05:50
You can do it on Okcoin, which has a handy mobile app
or 1broker which has higher leverage and other markets like gold, oil and forex

Have you considered doing all low voltage power, so your not losing efficiency going DC -&gt; AC -&gt; DC
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:26:08
Until the difficulty re adjusts and then both chains can be viable
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:19:38
the difference here being the crowdsale contracts that distribute coins/tokens without an intermediary, or at least the automation being baked into the system.
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:27:19
in the past you could clearly see transaction spikes around the 1st and 15th of each month, I have no doubt there is a similar pattern here with weekends and paydays driving peak periods

Life is a pyramid scheme, if more people don't participate, it dies
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:00:07
I don't think so because I believe a lot has been extracted from his own currency nautilus coin. Which has large fluctuatations and manipulations
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:08:56
Every exchange shut down deposits and withdrawals for the fork
@_date: 2016-12-10 02:28:32
Starts at 10pm EST
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:35:41
Can't wait for the headlines, "Bitcoin sold out!"
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:32:22
Also the first vulnerable addresses are ones with a broadcasted outgoing TX, so things like satoshi's coins are not even the first ones hit.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:29:57
Should really do ETF with satoshi or bits as the unit price
@_date: 2019-06-02 08:19:05
There's a boat in salt spring BC called The Silk Road as well
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:30:21
Batching has always been a better cost saving measure, during the period of 40$ transactions you would save up to 70% with batching transactions. Where as segwit is more like a 30% savings on fees but still dependent on the blocks
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:40:13
Going to be driving cross country soon, trying not to have any triggers for the civil asset forfeiture bullshit thats been happening. Oh you know about bitcoin, better confiscation all your electronics as they may be involved in a drug deal.
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:57:03
bitcoin is not a resistance movement
its an acceptance movement
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:19:28
I speak with Bill from bittrex regularly in the ubiq slack. Their legal team is leading a lot of the conversations with regulators. When the bit license dropped they applied immediately as to guarantee service to their new York customers.
Bittrex attends meetings on capital Hill and is helping set precedent in the space for the benefit of all. 
Bar none the best team in the space for bringing legitimacy and security for consumers.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:21:01
All you need to accept Bitcoin is a public key! /S
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:04:48
that explains the surge in transactions around payday.
Note to self, avoid using bitcoin the 1st and 15th of each month
@_date: 2018-11-11 06:59:14
Assuming that bitcoin is the only protocol that matters and we shouldn't decentralize innovation is kinda counter intuitive to the ideal of sound money.
Avoiding silver because it isn't gold is close minded

I'm working on a system to essentially be the airmiles for bitcoin. Gift card, share your purchase, interbusiness commerce and all that fun stuff
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:01:11
Exactly my point, gotta see the bigger picture and sides rather then fragment within our own coalition
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:34:51


Merchants also incurred more costs in addition to their fraud losses, with each dollar of fraud costing them $3.08,
compared to $2.79 last year. 
It's all regional, and overall the trend is increase, and becoming more expensive to deal with fraud.
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:11:09
I've seen plenty places that do it already, but even more that do cash only. So if they are limiting themselves to cash only, bitcoin is a low cost way to do digital payments, that cheaper than cash because storage and transfer costs are cheaper
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:20:32
the guy in the inside man doc said he loses 20-25% in credit card fraud. So if you do 10% permanent discount, and convert 50% of your consumers, you should come out ahead.
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:22:49
that was my issue with it too, anyone one can pick a random key for the seemingly infinite number of lockers so it's unlikely/impossible to find one that's already in use
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:08:20
I hate the personal attacks on individuals rather than the ideas they represent, at least for Ver. Dude has given away a lot of bitcoin to people over the years which brings new users in many times over. He deserves a minimal amount of respect for that. You can not like his business choices or his ideology towards the network but at least consider the mountain of his actions rather then the current boulders on top.   
We have too much work to do, so stop wasting energy on petty arguments when we all want to perpetuate the industry and technology.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:50:12
ARCHcoin, because the value of the coin not only increases but all the members. The value you get when you own enough arch to be member is fair more then any coin I ever held.
The collection of traders, enthusiasts and good people in ARCH tells me we'll be around for a long time.

Super cool, but I'm not sure whether to invest
1. They are the only Canadian Bitcoin exchange
2. The other 2 Canadian exchanges closed for financial and security reasons
Only two ways it could go lol
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:06:30
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:21:12
cool now I just need a time machine and $10,000
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:45:22
Wow that was cool and fast
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:46:06
Still faster than doing it by hand.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:31:15
For sure, I do it everywhere since I'm on a roadtrip. I always stop at BTM, wonder around for lunch and ask a few restaurants to help the little pockets
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:51:18
"Do you accept Bitcoin?"
*leaves, goes next door*
"Do you accept Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:27:27
I don't get it, what's so game changing?
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:09:28
I'm sure the binance DEX will be just as immutable as bitcoin, or at least as he views it
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:50:11
how do you maintain the daily payout anonymously
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:14:04
works fine for me
