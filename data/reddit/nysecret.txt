Kudos for not panic selling. You have a couple options now. 
1. Hodl
2. Try to gauge the bottom and go all in (with what you have left to invest).
3. Invest a little bit day to day as it goes down or goes up. 
Personally if I had your capital, I’d go half in now that its under 10k, and then do like $100 day-to-day from here. 
First thing you need to learn is you will NEVER buy at the lowest and sell at the highest (and true believers aren’t even trying to sell). 
This dip is just profit taking, bitcoin has proven its resilience, smart traders buy low, so I say keep buying. That’s what I’ll be doing fwiw.

The second transfer took almost twice as long as the first one (maybe about 5 and 10 hours respectively), but they've all gone through now, thanks again!

Great, thanks! I'm gonna go for it now. Really appreciate your write up, if you send me your address I'd gladly tip you :)

Sent! Let's see how long it takes to get there haha, I ended up only trying to move a small amount of my coin to my wallet, if it works I'll send the rest later tonight. Thanks again!

Thanks for this extremely clear and useful tool. I'm concerned about the delays though, am I at risk of losing my bitcoin if transfer to breadwallet from coinbase now? Should I still do it? Or should I try with a small amount of bitcoin now and see if it shows up?
