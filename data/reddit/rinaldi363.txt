Sounds like how gold works in real life. People hype it up and make it seems valuable so the price goes up... Yet gold hasn't done anything to increase it's value. It's just a rock. The funny thing is the entire planet has put this value into gold over many years. So far 0.1% of the worlds population puts value into bitcoin. What happens when 10% of the worlds population start wanting bitcoin? 100x more valuable at that point.
You are thinking of bitcoin like a company on the stock market. It;s share price goes up or down based on how well the company does and how the news portrays it. When really you should be thinking of bitcoin like a commodity.

Take gold for an example. It is only worth anything because we give it value. The entire world knows about gold, this yellow metal which is essentially useless. But there is only so much of a known supply of it, so people have decided on its value from how much they are willing to spend to have some of it.
Bitcoin is the same thing. It's essentially worthless, but if a bunch of people come together and want to have it, it's value will go up. And the people who have it want to keep it.
Everybody in the world knows about gold. Maybe 0.1% of the worlds population is invested in bitcoin. As more of the population starts WANTING bitcoin, the value dramatically increases.

Yeah you're basically just copying everything Andreas M. Antonopoulos said in a youtube video. You even used the exact same example.
But we will pretend this is "your opinion" ;)

What if every user of coinbase sold all their bitcoins at the same time and at that time no one is buying bitcoin through coinbase. Coinbase has that much money to pay every single person? I know it's a drastic situation, but I'm curious.

I don't understand where coinbase got this "large enough fund". The only money they ever made is from transaction fees. You say coinbase has coins in cold storage, but where did they get these coins originally? They would have had to buy them with their own money, which would put them at a negative cash flow.
The only profit that company can possibly make is from transaction fees...? I feel like I'm just not comprehending where coinbase got it's initial money from.

Can this guy really sell his bitcoins for ~2mil no problem? Like whatever online platform he's using will send that much money to his account in 1 transaction?
