It may not be better, but it's just as credible as yours

"Complicated language" it's from Wikipedia 
If you think a major economic theory that we saw definite proof for and has been studied is false, there's no point continuing this argument.
Best of luck to you and your bitcoin

Ok let's assume the best and say that there is a steady price appreciation, that itself would not be a desirable aspect in a currency. In order for a stable and sustainable economy, money velocity needs to be relatively high and stay high. With a steady appreciating asset, it would not be a viable currency. If you know the money you get is going to be worth more in the future, there is no incentive to spend. Aiming for a steady price appreciation is once again looking at bitcoin like a commodity or an investment rather than a currency. There's a reason the FED aims for an average of 2% inflation, so people have an incentive to spend the money they have. Without that, a deflationary spiral can crash the entire value of the currency.
Let's ignore that for now to address another issue. In a completely bitcoin economy, there still must be lenders to lend out bitcoin for businesses to invest or government to spend. For lack of a better term let's call these lending bodies banks which charge an interest rate for lending. If there was a sudden shock to the economy that greatly increases the demand for bitcoin as an asset to hold, the interest rates go up. This would cause an decrease in the inflation rateof the currency, and once again the same issue is faced (along with additional issues such as higher unemployment and a lower gross domestic product) The only difference is the FED can change the money supply of fiat money, but their hands are tied with bitcoin. They cannot take any measures to ease the shock and the economy is out of control, literally because nobody can do anything to control it.

Ah, that makes sense, thanks for discussing with me

That's my point though, the majority of the user base of bitcoin views it more as a commodity than a currency, like gold. For the vast majority of people, it is an investment instrument rather than a currency. If gold was as volatile as bitcoin is right now, many more people would be supporting gold instead. As soon as the volatility dies down (which it must as a currency, no stable currency can have this amount of volatility to sustain an able economy), wouldn't all the "greater fools" jump ship. Then what you would be left with is a low value online currency with no way to change the supply of money in the economy, making the currency itself unable to self correct inflationary or recessionary gaps, with only a core few using it. If this is truly what lies ahead for bitcoin, how can everyone tout it as the currency of the future?

I'm no genius with iq 200, just a high school senior taking macroeconomics who is interested in bitcoin.

The issue with relying on the greater fool theory is that if you don't get out in time, you are the greater fool though. Are you basically saying that bitcoin can't have long term viability

Time to set up some long bitcoin swaps then.

Maybe look up what the greater fool theory is
The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants. A price can be justified by a rational buyer under the belief that another party is willing to pay an even higher price. In other words, one may pay a price that seems "foolishly" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a "greater fool" later.

Your faith in bitcoin is closer to theology than science
