It seems as though the author of this article has identified bitcoin as a perfect match more than Argentines. They are listed as almost very last (46th) in the "very high" category for countries on the Human Development scale 2013. [Source](
The same source says only ~36% of Argetines are internet users and only ~9% own a personal computer (p186) This isn't totally up to date (5 years), but the discrepancy is obvious. At the same time in the US, ~80% of people owned a computer and ~74% of people were internet users.

Transaction fees on a sidechain couldn't be higher than bitcoin, and it's pointless to waste processing power when bitcoin will make you more money.
Demurrage - this doesn't answer why would anyone mine in the first place, if the mining is what gives it value.

Please do not link articles from coindesk. They do not seem to have any formal process of correcting mistakes and publish incorrect information all the time.
in addition, the writers are exceptionally horrid and it's often very confusing to read their articles.
Upvoting them reflects badly on the community, as they rarely add any new information beyond the APress release, have championed blatant scams in the past for their own profit and do not care about important suggestions for their improvement.

If transaction fees are higher, consumers wouldn't use the sidechain instead of the mainchain. if the transaction fees are lower, miners won't have incentive. If fees are the exact same, then you're doing a parallel-chain, not a side chain. 
For the same reason consumers wouldn't use something that cost more to send, consumers wouldn't use something that penalized them for using it (in theory, even though U.S. cash holders are penalized through inflation).
Blockstream site is B.S. the only interesting thing I read on there was the Bios of the team. The "whitepaper" is a proposal. Not a proof-of-concept explanation like the Bitcoin whitepaper. "future-viable" does mean really able to be created. I don't think that any form of currently proposed sidechain can exist.

Any entity doing any of the doomsday scenarios you've listed would bring the entire worth of their operation to $0. They would not be executed by anyone looking after their self-interest and the longevity of BTC.
 A 51% attack executed by an outside source such as a banking system or government is much more serious, that's why it's important that as much hashpower as possible be contributed to the network.
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:14:20
it's not a guarantee at all, and their hashrate DID change.. You have a complete misunderstanding. It means that over time their probability of solving a block is greater than 51%.
 that's all. 
In order for them to perform a 51% attack on the network, they would have to start hiding their blocks and it would be apparent very quick if that was happening, and people with mining contracts would all get rid of them.

Just because you personally haven't heard of it means it hasn't happened? As soon as *public* tools are released anyone will be able to easily see where their coins have been in a graphically pleasing manner. Coinbase is just the beginning.
I'm not saying you can't be anonymous using crypto, btw. You just have to use good security practices. 
But, think about this: NSA requires coinbase to comply with 100% of eavesdropping requests. They know every KYC profile and every BTC purchase of all those users. Their IP addresses. Any new transactions originating from that IP can be assumed to be the same person.

I love your comparison of the block chain to the printing press because I think it's accurate! A true method of trustless accounting - even my professional accountant mother who thinks bitcoin is a scam recognizes the ability to verify every single transaction as an insanely productive development for our world.
my question for you is: what is the blockchain without blockchain incentives??? if Bitcoin didn't have an exponentially growing network due to the incentives of miners, the blockchain wouldn't be secured by that massive force.  I submit Bitcoin is the best crypto, with the best technical specs, because in the long run the technical spec that matters is the size of the network and Bitcoin has the biggest

Sorry, I'm correct. Cash is quite untraceable and is accepted everywhere. All bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public chain... I certainly should be getting upvotes.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:39:14
I think you've got it switched here. Cash is untraceable. Bitcoins are very very traceable.
Edit: I'm also not saying you can't be anonymous using crypto. I very much believe you can with good security practices.

it's sad when people don't realize that their faucet is giving them $.0001 and the days of the .25btc free-flood are done.
if you want some BTC to play around with before committing,  I highly recommend trying out the Bitcoin Testnet. there are plenty of faucets giving away a substantial amount to play with on Testnet

Please do not link articles from coindesk. They do not seem to have any formal process of correcting mistakes and publish incorrect information all the time.
in addition, the writers are exceptionally horrid and it's often very confusing to read their articles.
Upvoting them reflects badly on the community, as they rarely add any new information beyond the APress release, have championed blatant scams in the past for their own profit and do not care about important suggestions for their improvement.

EDIT: I'm being told that storage costs will decrease according to Moore's law. Apparently past performance is indicative of future performance? ...Even as Intel is having trouble switching to smaller and smaller nm nodes.
Fine. Let's say it's 2035 and the blocksize has been increasing "slowly":
* Year - 2015 (41KMB (40GB))
* Year - 2017 (841kMB (841GB))
* Year - 2019 (3285GB (3.2TB))
* Year - 2021 64MB Blocks (9855GB (9.624 TB))
* Year - 2023 128MB Blocks (22.456TB)
* Year - 2025 256MB Blocks (48.12TB)
* Year - 2027 412MB Blocks (89.423TB)
* Year - 2029 1024MB 1GB (192.09TB)
* Year - 2031 2048MB 2GB (397.4TB)
* Year - 2033 4096MB 4GB Blocks (808.025TB)
* Year - 2035 7.6GB Blocks (1588.21TB (1.55PB))
Assuming storage follows Moore's law closely (which it wont), and storage costs $.004/GB in 2035, that's $4/TB
In 2035. that's $6500. Which, once again I have proven, renders BTC useless in a "most of the world" scenario.
~~With 128MB blocks you would potentially add 6.4 TB of data to the blockchain/year. This would add approximately $315/year of data to the blockchain. Meaning it would take the average consumer around $4500 just to get BTC running securely in 2024. This makes decentralization impossible.~~
If the free market wants the blocksize to decrease, why would you prevent that? If Bitcoin can't pay for its own security, wouldn't you rather find out soon than later?
32MB as a *protocol maximum* limit seems very effective. What evidence is there that bitcoin would need to change beyond that?

 it would be financially feasible/worth it to sell someone some BTC and try to double spend the transaction if they accepted 0 conf. In the case of 1 or 2 confirmations they would have to have a lot of mining power but it could be done. It would just be risky/ cost a lot

No one is ignoring Bitcoin. All you have to do is open the newspaper and you'll see it mentioned. I thought it was a given that you were wrong on this point.
"There is no way to say but it is super unlikely"
Is this even English? what are you trying to say?
"and if you**'**r**e** basing your hope in it getting popular again I feel sorry for you"
It's not hope, it's an educated guess made in line with the smartest people of our generation.

there doesn't need to be any more users. Bitcoin is probably too technical as is for any more people to proficiently use.

is hiveminding you right now but what you're saying is true AND adds to the discussion.
If Bitcoin in its current state went up against the USGov, it would be worth a lot a lot less, and have a lot less interest from developers who value their lives. Fortunately that hasn't happened yet, but we should be prepared in case they ever try to break the fungibility of bitcoin.
