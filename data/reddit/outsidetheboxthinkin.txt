10-20% is 10-20%. Not the most expensive one in terms of that.

So you literally had to make up things to justify your opinion. Stocks have never been added up all together but you want to, to make yourself right. The amount of idiots like you make me face palm.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:32:47
Lol you’re a dumb dumb 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:06:35
Obviously not gonna get far with you, for some reason you think it's OK to ruin other peoples charity causes. Literally the scum of the earth. Have a good day being you, bet its a lot of fun being triggered all the time.

The idea that everyone is investing in bitcoin just to invest in it, not because it's being used more and more (its literally growing consumer side SLOW) is crazy to me. It's people investing just because it's going up and then pretending it's because of the tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:11:23
Not as bad as trying to ruin someones cause tho! I think I Would've been OK with it if you handled yourself differently too because I Couldn't care less about Wikileaks. You just straight up "Don't donate , please!!!!!"
The appropriate way would've been: Hey, just so you know they might have a weird agenda (link)  
Let people form their own opinions, asking the way you did is the same as telling. Not everyone has your opinion and this guys cause needs to be as respected as I would respect any bullshit feminist thing you could've posted and I wouldn't of said a thing.

Gold is also a physical thing that is rare/hard to get. Crypto is a digital thing that is rare/hard to get. Could be overlooked as a small difference but I think it’s significant when making that comparison.

You understand this is not about you right? The guy asked everyone to make their own requests, doesn't matter if you agree with it or not. People like you are the scum of the world, if you can't have it you don't want someone who thinks different to have it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:32:03
i dun wanna
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:59:28
You made it about you by inserting your beliefs, telling someone not to invest in this guys cause because you don't agree with it... Aww, poor baby doesn't agree with something on the interweb and must get her opinion in.
It's a discussion board with certain types of discussions, this thread is not about opinions. It's literally "Post your cause" type deal and because you don't like this guy's cause you want to ruin it. No we are not discussing charities. Bet your a feminist.

Seconds? You know you're lying here..... I just was using BTC today, transfered it and it took 8 hours and cost $15.... Nice try, I'm a BTC fan/user but don't pretend its something it's not. The whole tech is pretty fucked right now.
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:17:57
Where do you see the biggest opportunity with bitcoin and what does bitcoin need to move forward?
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:13:11
Like I said, I'm here to learn. 1 billion doesn't make sense into a dead currency but what scares me is one of the top voted articles of this reddit is about banks making their own digital currency.
I get why you bitcoiners think its stupid (even to me it makes sense why thats dumb) but the banks have the general public on there side as far as media relations // getting people to actually move to something (think about how many companies accept visa and could easily accept the banks new digital currency with the same card)which makes me nervous about doing anything in this industry.
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:37:07
That's a lot to take in, it sounds like bitcoin will always be around but may never be mainstream. The hope is obviously mainstream because of the benefits but, people like you are going to make sure it lives no matter what and that's worth building for.
Is that right/wrong/close?
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:28:01
Makes sense. So in a sense its safe to say BitCoin is basically "The peoples currency."
What does it need the most to move forward in your opinion?
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:09:08
I'm just speaking fact, I have a lot of experience in entrepreneurship and I'm interested in bitcoin because I think there may be something there. Just trying to figure out what. 
yes I realize how many times I just said I/I'm
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:06:55
Exactly why I made a thread like this, so I can learn from people who know like yourself.
@_date: 2015-12-14 18:55:40
Well said, thank you!
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:16:49
You guys wont trust BankCoin, I get that. But my mom and everyone else her age will see this as the first, so why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:31:40
My bad! Just wanted to make sure the thread got attention, probably better ways. (referring to demanding people to convince me)... Didn't mean to come off like that, I just knew there was knowledgable people here.
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:58:17
Good stuff, glad to see it's matured into a welcoming community that wants people who may be help innovate the future of it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:30:30
I think your smart (seriously, no sarcasm) but the top posts this year didn't really seem that relevant (just being honest, not a hater!)
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:59:45
Have not heard about it (and i live in a very tech centered world) in a long time.
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:18:21
I will definitely take a look right now and then reply again with any Q's
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:11:34
This is beyond biased. Always check your sources, she clearly is a pro-bitcoin writer with nothing but positives to say. If it was a balanced writer this story would mean something. (google her name)
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:29:37
It's great if you know how to play the market, I shorted BTC and making $$$ still!
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:34:03
I agree, Bitcoin is dying. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:36:42
I was going to short btc as well its too hard to get.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:05:37
I agree, I had 5k ready to go to short bitcoin and signed up at all the popular sites to try to make it happen. 3 hours later, still nothing. Would have to jump through so many hoops and my cash would'n't of been available to buy bitcoin for a couple days still. I missed some easy money due to how bitcoin is hard to buy. IMO it's dead already with biased supporters leftover. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:27:39
I shorted it at $412 (still haven't cashed out) making $$$$ My guess is it will stop going down at 370
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:54:16
Thanks for the links ! They are good for gathering information but I'm really looking to make a friend to talk to real-time about the trades we're doing --e.g. I picked up BTCUSD at 692 (about 2 hours ago) , when it gets back to 700 I'll make .1 but I don't know if I should hold a little longer. 
//to the random people that may see this - Yes I know long term it will probably be worth way more but this is day trading :P
@_date: 2016-11-05 17:20:56
Why? The market is pretty big... One would think sharing knowledge would only help profits
@_date: 2016-11-05 17:51:23
The volume is pretty big in the BTCUSD market..... You would have to have A LOT of leverage to pull something like that off...... I think you're thinking more of big influencers making their way into the news sites or something.... I  could dump right now and so could a lot of people and it wouldn't do shit.
@_date: 2016-11-05 22:18:58
This looks amazing !~ TY so much ! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:46:31
I love  McDs ! But comparing it to something like Gordon Ramsay’s burger place in Vegas is crazy !! I forgot ever what it’s called but night and day difference.... I think it’s called burgr
