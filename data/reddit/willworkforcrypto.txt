Doesn't seem likely. If an extremely wealthy and well-funded organization was behind it, these would make no sense:
* Why publish it as open source? Closed source with backdoors would fit their agenda better.
* It's not new of an idea. Neal Stephenson's *Cryptonomicon*, which describes the idea in detail, was published about 14 years ago.
* It's not that complex of a program that it couldn't have been done by some grad students or someone with a mid-level programmer job.
* Parts of Bitcoin code come from the Conficker worm, which basically kicked the entire U.S. Government's ass. Government bureaucrats would be afraid of the *career risk* of releasing something like that into the wild. Read *Worm* by Mark Bowden to understand this better.
* If the government wrote it and is secretly behind it, why did it take this long for it to take off? With professional funding/backing, it should have spread a lot faster.

You're right, there's a ways to go. Bitcoin itself is an acknowledged *beta test*. It has its niches, though, such as gambling. 
It definitely needs escrow services and more mainstream acceptance. That said, it's come a long way, and there's a lot of dedicated people putting in hours to make it work.
Bitcoin is a *platform*. What it needs is a *killer app* that brings people into it. The original home PCs didn't sell until the spreadsheet (first major must-have app for small businesses) came along.
The community needs to find a similar use-case to tackle.

Was this on post? Because the American facilities would always exchange it. You could also exchange Yen -&gt; Won, anywhere.
It was in the Japanese airports and banks where they refused to take Won -&gt; Yen. I was always told it had to do with Japan not having a need for it. It might not have been profitable for them hold. 
They would usually have a sign up that said something to the effect of "We do not exchange Korean Won. Thank you."

By *complicit*, I believe he means "knowing, but not saying anything."
I don't have any problem believing that. Lavabit and other companies were issued *National Security Letters* ordering them to comply with the NSA's monitoring requests. 
The PATRIOT Act forbids those issued such a letter from even speaking openly of it. That's why Lavabit shut down, and the announcement gave no specific reason.

I'd like to throw out a personal idea. 
As an avid online gamer all throughout college, I think this would be an ideal target community, that already accepts the idea. 
Hell, I remember people back in *old school* Diablo 2 having all the same arguments (OMG *real* money for 1's and 0's!?), so there's really no convincing to do. Everyone's already hashed out the for/against arguments.
People have been selling MMO currencies, accounts, and online items for fiat for years. Ebay was the go-to place for a long time. Until they banned selling of virtual property. Now there are alternative auction sites.
What better target audience could you ask for?
* [Player Auctions](
* [Account Warehouse](
* [Armory Bids](
* [Guy4Game](
* [Buy MMO Accounts](

If BTC captures 1% of global GDP, that would give it a nominal value of over $1 million per coin.

I agree on the points about taxation. It will become increasingly difficult for TPTB to enforce it.

I concur with your point. I've seen some of both of the above.
Here's a counter point:
In the Summer of 2007, the first iPhone came out. A few people rushed in, all crazy about it. I thought they were pretty dumb.
A friend of mine got one. I thought it was silly and not really useful, the app selection was limited. I told myself "thats dumb, I'll never waste that much money on a phone."
Six years later, I have a smart phone. Not sure I could get by without it. Now that the apps, features, and data support for it are there, you really *have* to have one to get by in modern society.
I suspect in six years, the people who have negative impressions of Bitcoin now, may just be using it, or some other, better crypto coin.
Does anyone really want the Federal Reserve in charge of their money in six years? At the rate they're printing?
@_date: 2013-09-14 19:15:19
I meant global. Modern prices expressed in dollars are artificially lowered by the fact that the *petrodollar* constitutes an oil monopoly, giving USD futures values they could never fetch in a free market.
USD hyperinflation is a given at *some* point. It can't go on forever.
Look what happened in the 70's when OPEC squeezed oil exports. A post-petrodollar world will look at lot like that, unless you see rapid provisioning of alternative energy.
It's certainly possible, Germany now has a national Solar Power grid with over 28 Nuclear Reactors worth of solar production.

Soccer is thought to originate in  [Second Century B.C.]( when it was invented as exercise for troops. 
They invented the game. Your son is playing it. He is an unwitting participant in an ancient *conspiracy*. Though we normally don't think of it this way.
Every time you buy something off of a store shelf, know that men in business suits sat down and came up with a *conspiracy* to put that item there. For profit even!
The point I'm really trying to make is that the line between *planning* and *conspiracy* is nonexistent if you think about it often enough.
I believe that Bitcoin has a *conspiracy*. But is it an institutional one, or a bunch of geeks who sat around and thought it up? I've worked for the 3-letter agencies, and if they made something like this, it would probably be a lot less simple, user friendly, and useful. In fact, it would probably be a complete disaster, and not work at all. You're giving the government way too much credibility and competence here.

The United States is [dead last]( in the world in net debt export. The only reason we aren't already falling apart is because of the violence-enforced petrodollar monopoly.
Because of this, our debt problems are distributed over all other countries that hold our debt. Because oil is a universal product, this happens to be everyone. Which means that the world is paying for the mistakes of our government, not us.
When the petrodollar goes, we're in for a rude wake up call.

Special Drawing Rights are a private currency only issued to a few hundred of the world's elite who fall in special favor with the international bankers.
They're issued by the [Bank of International Settlements]( and they are *officially* redeemable in a weighted currency basket of four major currencies: the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.
Other currencies have likely been added *in secret* as the IMF/BIS elite do not like to announce their inner workings to the public.
The full number of issued SDRs is believed to be over 400 billion, though the BIS/IMF, like the Federal Reserve, abhor the idea of a public audit.
Bitcoin currently acts as a sort of "poor man's SDR" as it is redeemed in a number of other national currencies and free-floats in value. The BIS/IMF basically can decree the value of SDR's, whereas Bitcoin has no central authority and must compete on the open market for exchange value.
