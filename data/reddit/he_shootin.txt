 I've been watching the price fluctuate for about 4 years now and 3 weeks ago I decided to go in thru Coinbase.  When I saw the price this morning my asshole clinched so hard I've been shitting silly string all day.  I'm in it for the long haul though and hopefully the communities faith in bitcoin will overcome.

My story is sadly exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:12:39
Didn't know it worked like that on LN, can someone please elaborate, in an explain like I'm noob way.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:13:21
Even the bots are small blockers!
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:44:42
Yes they did, but it took forever
@_date: 2016-11-03 13:27:46
As someone who doesn't know much about cryptography this scares me, I love bitcoin and tell all my friends about it constantly but how realistic of a problem is this?
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:08:26
Can you expand on that last sentence. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:11:18
So do they get the entire fee of a tx or does the wallet you are using take a significant cut. Appreciate the input.

I would also like to know. I don't think Polo is more risky than bitfinex though.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:44:41
I seriously would donate if he accepted

Me after getting caught with porn on my browser. Oh this is just a random pop up.
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:25:31
yes please. i got family out there.

Cuba Libre! I got my coinbase account shutdown when I visited Cuba. I wish they had more access to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:42:08
What is the difference between this and an actual Bitcoin ETF?
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:27:27
Internet in Cuba is absurdly expensive and only works when you buy govt cards that allow you to access the internet in hour long increments. Also incredibly slow.
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:30:11
they pay around 2 bucks an hour for internet access too, but im sure if they could hold it and trade it the would,  they switch back from 3 different currencies on a daily basis.
@_date: 2019-09-08 07:17:14
there absolutely is a way. keep looking
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:36:49
Thanks man. I spread the gospel to everyone I know.  I am looking into to buying a gaming pc pretty soon and hopefully I can run a node through that. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:01:59
Electrum is good but I like the simple design of Exodus, it makes things easy for beginners.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:17:40
thank you, people who can't run nodes really appreciate the extra effort! I just hope I can afford my gaming PC to run a node before august. UASF!
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:04:05
I've pretty much conceded defeat on this one. If I get them it'll be like finding money in my pant pockets.  So disappointed in Polo...
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:56:47
What are you even trying to say here? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:59:13
Once I'm in that club I'll gladly shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:21:21
44 days waiting for a etc transaction that vanished....44 days. Come on Polo. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:23:41
They resolved my issue today. Not sure if it was a coincidence, but it was my fault the whole time, I'm using a trezor and did not set it to the ethereum classic node. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:48:26
You can get an exodus wallet, its worked perfectly for me and has shapeshift onboard. Download it on your computer.
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:36:24
Look man, no need to get on me for missing one post, I probably actually read it and STILL didn't find a clear solution.  Speaking as an absolute technological noob I just wanted to know how I can contribute. The best I got was spreading the word on social media. I don't think any of my 46 twitter followers would really care. If someone was to make a youtube video, or a step by step list explaining it, more simpletons like myself could help. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:41:21
I have a macbook air and it says the start up disk is full whenever i try to run the core node. I also have very limited technical ability when it comes to computers so I might just be fucking up. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 07:01:10
nope it was you, someone took a picture and you were in it they uploaded it and I jerked off to it, no disrespect. Your jaw line is amazing

I went to Tokyo and bought an electric razor from Bic with Bitcoin, it was the first thing I ever bought in person with Bitcoin and it was such a fucking cool experience. I don't know if they still go with zero confirmation, but the transaction was instant. Bic Cameras btw, are not camera stores at all, they are like the Charizard to Walmarts Charmander, 7 stories of anything and everything you could need to buy.

ive rubbed one out to you, in my culture thats a compliment
@_date: 2019-05-03 06:51:33
what does this mean????
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:06:24
I would like to know the answer to this as well. Good question.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:51:46
I love trezor
