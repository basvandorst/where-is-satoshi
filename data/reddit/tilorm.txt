If they had a Bitcoin they could afford an HD camera.

No, the fee will always be subtracted from the input coins. If the output is the same amount as the input, there is no fee and your transaction will be ignored again.

Some dickhead may still mine it in a block, so I suggest you send those coins to yourself after you have your wallet fixed.

Define 'real money'.

All your Bitcoins ARE backed. Any amount of btc in your wallet will sit there until you touch it. The value is not backed though, but I don't need to explain why btc has value.

No, you can't be really sure that way. Any coin that was included in the failed transaction can be used to permanently block that transaction. Sending any amount does not ensure that any of those coins are included, it may be other coins as well.
I don't know how many times you have received any bitcoin, but if you only received once, you can send any amount to yourself because all your bitcoin is in just a single coin.
In a bitcoin transaction old coins are added up and stop existing and the new value minus the fee can be split into new coins or be a single coin. If a coin is sent, it no longer exists but the value exists in a new coin. If a coin that no longer exists is an input of a transaction, that transaction will fail completely. If you can find out what coin(s) were in the failed transaction, you just need to use one of those coins (send to self) and since it can be spend only once, the failed transaction can never occur.

If a bank is backed, it means that if shit happens to a bank and it becomes bankrupt, up to $xx is insured.
Bitcoin hodlers are their own banks, so there is no bank to claim any value from, except yourself.
ofc you can store your bitcoins at a 'bank' and if that bank falls, your bitcoins are gone, but if you just let it sit there and trust that bank then you are just an idiot.

Best practice is to send it to a new address in your wallet. Just generate a new receiving address as if someone will send you btc but send your btc to that address yourself. Be sure you set the right fee.
As you can see here  tx are expensive.
Here  you can see what fee (in satoshi/byte) is best.
If you wish to use your bitcoins now, you don't need to send them to yourself first, just use them in a transaction and if that transaction is confirmed, your previously failed transaction can never be mined.
Last thing I want to say about this:
The coins in the transaction that failed may exist out of multiple pieces of bitcoin from different transactions. Be sure at least one of those particular 'coins' is used in a new transaction (whether you send them to yourself or someone else). So if that failed transaction exists out of multiple coins and you only want to invalidate that transaction, just make the transaction as small as possible (in bytes).
