THIS and I am hooping for more of a drop off...my long term goal is to buy more so I welcome a drop off now.
I have been doing the same thing with precious metals for a few years now and have accumulated quite a collection

Awesome man I bought a bunch in Nov 2013 right before it exploded over $1000, I sold almost all of them and bought gold and silver with the money.  I still held only a couple and just started buying back..  Now im not selling though im buying a little at a time and not even thinking of selling 
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:07:16
Ok if your interested in selling some id love to buy them.
They are .999 silver?
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:31:50
I am now rooting for drops in the market so I can buy more 
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:27:16
Wow ok I'll check this out 
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:09:19
Would you want to sell a loaded silver one? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:54:41
Looks like that's a book.  How much for a loaded silver one?  
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:32:03
Are they loaded?  I mean do they have a BTC stored in them?
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:42:32
That was great thanks op
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:35:35
I'm getting offline for the night so I will respond tomorrow.  I'm a trusted buyer on pmsforsale also 
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:23:28
I agree with this post..dont get anxious be happy with what you have and either buy more or just sit on them..
Ive traded in the market (stocks) quite a bit and trust me you can lose a LOT very fast 
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:59:45
I think it has a lot to do with the price of BTC.
If it skyrockets again I bet the subs go way up 
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:20:42
Yea I'm interested in the silver one.  Um they might say .999 right on them?  Well maybe just throw a number out and then show me a photo if you can.  How many did you say you had?
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:55:06
You have gold or silver one?  
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:56:21
WOW very cool 
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:53:54

@_date: 2014-07-22 20:42:01

@_date: 2014-03-06 14:26:25

@_date: 2014-03-04 02:54:44
That's what I did but lately I've been trading for metals but I need to stop this 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:26:44
Wouldn't the real Satochi finally step up to show that Mr Wright is NOT him?
