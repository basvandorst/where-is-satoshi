If you have not ovrwritten the space, check out Photorec. You'll need to copy the contents of the phone somehow or mount it as a disk, it's not hard to use if you are ok with following instructions
I recently used it to recover files that were in a windows partition that was formatted and had linux installed on top of it.
It was very successful.
It might take some time, and you'll have to dig through a lot of data, but it is worth it

How much is the mean daily payout and how steady are the payouts in the 12-month contract. When he describes the stability of their payouts, ask him how can they have non-diminishing payouts in the face of ever increasing difficulty
BitClub is a blatant ponzi, a multi-million MLM scheme
Source: I am running a small bitcoin related business in my hometown and one of their local affiliates made an in-house call. He even presented his business card, where he called himself a "BitCoin Miner"
He knew jack shit about how mining works, did not have an idea of what difficulty is, kept referring to their hashpower in absolute fiat money terms, he was vaguely alluding to some mining farm in Estonia, did not know what miners they were using, or software they were running or any of the mining models in the market, and pointed me to his website, a web of lies and misnomers, selling "Cloud Mining Shares" to modest investors.
The website has no real info, and you need a referral code to enroll in the program, making sure that all newcomers are vetted in-person first
These people are cancer

Just Think Of The Children^TM
This is BS. 
Money laundering is taking place inside the legal financial system. Slavery and human trafficking is older than money. CP has been practiced in all classes and echelons of human society in every nation on Earth since the dawn of time, and we have a whole country and its economy almost dedicated to it. [Homo Sapiens]( ruled the planet because the genocide over the rest of his contemporary Homos was successful and he's been waging wars forever. 
None of that will never stop. All of it so far has been paid with precious metals, salt, fiat and it will be paid with every other transaction system we collectively as a species develop.
We've had authoritarian systems imposing their will for as long as we have societies. And we've had countless good-willing souls that got corrupted on the way to save us, not to mention of the billions of lives claimed throughout history because some local warlord woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
We still bury people in the sand and stone them, we bomb others for their commodities, we gang-rape people inside fucking buses. in 2018. In the 21st Century. 
Human malice does not end, because it is part of what makes us human.
The collective personal and financial privacy from **everyone** and **for everyone** is more important for our society in the long run.

I am merely pointing out that "think of the children" is not a valid point. 
All those things happened before bitcoin came to be and will happen for ever, get over it.
I am not saying I enjoy violence against others, I am merely acknowledging that an invention of the 21st century has nothing to do with the collective evil of our species.
Bitcoin is transparent and pseudonumous. It will take time to make it anonymous but we are getting there.
And yes, I firmly believe that in order for humanity to able to help the people you care about, then we need anon bitcoin.
If history is an indicator, bitcoin users will be raped just as much as fiat/visa users. An immutable and uncensorable currency is essential for helping all those poor souls, privately, without "The Man", or anyone else knowing what I spend my money on.
Tell me, people that need that help, can they be effectively helped, if the .gov says no?
Eg, can you send money from your bank account to buy Petros from Venezuela without having DHS knocking down your door?
Would you want your future overlord knowing that you paid moneyz to charities he despises??
Financial privacy is a needwd feature in the digital age

The US gov laws do not apply to Bitcoin, keep that in mind.
US gov laws apply to US citizens, and people doing business with US entities or persons in the US.
I think the term "ownership" confuses you. In your example, the "relative" can have possesion, eg for safekeeping, of your PK, or a part of it, or he may otherwise gain access to it. If noone knows he also has access to the key, does he really have access?
Bitcoin cannot really be "owned" in a physical fashion or form, or even in context that the world, US included, has seen so far. As such it creates challenges for everyone involved. Authorities will need to find new ways to classify new things.
Think of "owning" the Bitcoin PKs of your example in the terms of a 0-day exploit:
One or more entities are made aware of a possible exploit in a program. Which of those entities actually "owns" the information of the exploit?

but, what if you game for bitcoin?
[This is a recently announced beta]( using the lightning network. 
Can you imagine it happening in a LOL or EVEOnline scale?

Oh well, now your statements make sense.
Bitcoin privacy is like the polar opposite of your job, but it is a long way from my financial privacy to children being gangraped thanks to bitcoin.
Do you personally along with the banking community also take responsibility for all the banks facilitating world crime?
Because according to your logic, you should.
I thought so

install electrum, back up your seed and relevant keys, remove electrum
give your nephew a nice postcard with the seed written, and keep a back up yourself, if you think it might be of use in the future
do it all on a live usb like Tails, if you're a bit paranoid, otherwise even your phone can do

your bitcon(.)con site is centered around an altcoin though, not Bitcoin
And has nothing to do with LocalBitcoins.com
Please take your Ver funded propaganda somewhere else

What if you start thinking about it in Satoshis?
If you hodl 1 bitcoin, it feels so little.
But if you say to yourself "I hodl 100.000.000 Satoshis" the woah-dude factor goes off the charts.
You'll feel like a millionaire instantly

What does bitcoin ever had to do with Venezuela, is there any meaningful volume there, exchanges, a community?
FFS, not every failed economy props up bitcoin

Why would the hashpower run away from profits and mine a chain for less profits?
Miners are profit-seeking entities

That's exactly what happens in practice in the real world though.
It is not elected representatives, nor citizens that make those decisions

Dude, I am aware of the massive issues Venezuelans are facing.
But the fact that your frienda have access to bitcoin does not mean Venezuelans are doing it en masse, as you implied.
When populations jump in, you get increased trading volumes, you get increased google trends, you get premiums on local markets.
Venezuela lacks all of that. It's safe to say that they have a long way to go as a population before they diacover bitcoin
