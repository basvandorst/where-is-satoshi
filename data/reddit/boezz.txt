 Jason King is doing wonderful job. I read his interview and he seems genuine about his efforts. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 07:51:55
You can start now. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:08:24
Why are you shitting here, you asshole. You are scam not these sites. You motherfucker. You are a troll.

Damn! Fullerton Hotel is hell expensive. Bad decision to hold conference there. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 06:51:47
Yea, good move. Appreciated. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:24:39
Man, the charges against Silk Road tell that the owner of Bitcoin drug market solicited a murder for hire. That is simply disgusting. Such companies cannot be allowed. FBI did not do anything against Bitcoin but against an organized crime, so even if was not a Bitcoin company it would have been seized.

He is a 14 year old juvenile shitting everywhere in all threads. He is troll, don't feed him. You can check his comment history, he is obnoxiously present everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 15:44:33
Why are you commenting when you do not make sense. You know shit about math. Get out of @_date: 2013-10-04 08:57:32
They are aplenty in Mexico. Mexico is cool country.
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:20:11
This guy is a real troll man. He shits everywhere; don't feed him. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 09:01:19
Coinbase is fraud. Read this thread.
@_date: 2013-09-24 07:40:52
I think this guy is interested in negative karmawhoring. We need to discourage such people. They do not contribute anything.
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:08:32
Yea, I hope Coinvoice becomes an apt option for merchants. I voiced for it here in the thread to and answered the skeptics that since you are new company we need to wait and watch. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 16:53:40
STFU you idiot. They are the biggest Bitcoin exchange; does that make sense to you troll. Get out of @_date: 2013-09-25 07:51:49
what is your last wish?
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:57:05
Their affiliate program sounds interesting.

Haters gonna hate.

Watch for free. May be they will upload videos in Youtube later. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 10:29:34
What you fucking do man. Are you crazy. You shit everywhere. Your brain is full of shit you shitty face. Your obnoxious comments. You should be robbed from internet connection for juvenile behavior. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:43:34
Bitcoin is at teh stage that any bad name will bring strict action from the government. It cannot afford this.
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:04:29
Gentleman, we know what is what. We don't need your shit. Please keep that with you or in your mom's ass. 
your link and leave why to shit here and request to ban a site. Ad hominem arguments. You cannot challenge the news so challenge the source. You can always recheck news, you have Google at your service. Why to manipulate someone's mind not to trust some source and trust the source you say is trustworthy. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:54:44
When you are saying repost, you need to post the link bro. BTW I don't see it is a repost but yes this topic has been covered here before. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 08:04:45
There are so many unhappy customers :(
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:43:08
The FBI’s shutdown of web site Silk Road is a hollow victory in the hugely expensive war on drugs, which has consistently failed to stop the drug trade, or stop criminals from amassing huge amounts of wealth and ordering more than 60,000 murders in Mexico alone.
@_date: 2013-10-10 10:40:17
And again you are shitting everywhere. You asshole. Get out of or I will kick your ass. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:23:16
They are saying if you order now they will ship your ASIC in the late November. I think what they are asking is around two months' time to develop those machines. They don't actually have them now. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:37:48
This is going to be a big move from HashFast, their  Baby Jet and Sierra mining units built using Sea Sonic power supplies for consistently and maximum hashing performance will definitely help Bitcoin miners. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 08:27:11
Who is Dinosaurs? NASAA or Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:53:23
God damn. Bitcoin is close to $400.The price of Bitcoins has more than doubled even after the closing five weeks ago of the Silk Road Hidden Website.
I think people have started hoping that Bitcoin will soon be recognized by the US govt as Silk Road type companies that sold drugs, guns and other illicit goods for Bitcoins are gone. 
While the digital money lost a third of its value in the days after the website was shut down, it’s becoming an increasingly popular way of paying for goods and services on the Web and in stores that accept the tender.

Visit their website, the organizers are calling it the first Bitcoin convention in Asia. 
Singapore Conference is not convention. There is difference between conference and convention.
A conference involves delegates speaking to one another (for example a scientific conference where people present their research), while a convention involves delegates meeting for a common purpose (for example a convention on climate change, where some experts inform the delegates).

I have you seen at Chateau Heartiste. Are you the same guy?
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:44:34
Not sure about the safety or security feature but i think that Coinfloor are the best in terms of commissions. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 07:14:25
Is not he the same person who was accused of hiring an underage prostitute.

Yes, you are a wanker. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:27:43
If they do not understand it then how they conclude that it is volatile. Retarded logic they have. No wonder why the government is full with such scums. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:17:19
obnoxious. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:52:16
If you don't give a chance to any company how can it survive or be successful. It is a new company, just wait and watch. PayPal has an established infra and people. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 06:37:10
I read such rumors. I don't know whether these were rumors or news. It was discussed in Reddit too. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:41:27
Why are you sorry for this nut. He is scrapping everywhere. You see his comment history; he has objections for all posts. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:35:40
Man this is a master troll. Don't feed him. If you see his comments you will get to know. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:48:46
Are you missing Silk Road?
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:27:50
It will be interesting to listen to Richard Stallman. I have higher regard for this fellow.
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:07:15
Benjamin Franklin had said you may delay, but time will not. The same idea applies to Bitcoin. Protectionist posturing won't stop Bitcoin.

You can smoke, electronic cigarettes do not cause any health risk.

Where did they fail? Will you please elaborate.

I see you are not actually visiting You can read a lot of views and opinions there from our intellectuals mushrooming in the sub-reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:39:18
Try Ripple, it is also a good option. Problem with Bitcoin is that it is not available everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 15:01:57
You asshole. Stop shitting everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 09:45:29
You can start initiative. Contact to Bitcoin Foundation and write them. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 15:15:33
Yes, that is the whole point but Bitcoin fanboys do not understand this. The two can coexist and provide better services for customers. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:23:07
It is simply a cheating. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:14:49
So Bitcoins' time has come finally.
