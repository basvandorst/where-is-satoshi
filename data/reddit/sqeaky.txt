Your characterization of my mentality as:

My stance is much simpler, and much more reasonable. We just need the government to pay for certain things to have a stable and functioning society even if that means that sometimes the government abuses some of those funds. If the government is accountable to people then when those funds are wasted we kick the people that wasted it out and put new people in.

Do a Google search for "dollar cost averaging" it has been an investment strategy longer than the United States has had stock markets.
Basically, you invest a fixed amount every fixed unit of time. Perhaps $10 from every paycheck, or $1,000 a week or whatever you can afford each month. By purchasing more often and without regard to the price you naturally buy more when the price is low and less when the price is high. This averages out your costs. It also reduces your risk by spreading it out over a large number of practices.

Miners include a bunch of transactions in a block. When a minor mine's a new Bitcoin block they get the transaction fee and a block reward into a wallet of their choosing.
Miners are incentivized to pick the transactions with the highest fees to include in the next block. Right now if you want to guarantee that you get into the next block put $0.34 worth of bitcoin as you are fee and it will be mind very quickly. If you put 0 in for the fee it will take longer than an hour but might still get mined eventually. Put in some amount between there and you can adjust how long it will take to complete.
These blocks are the canonical listing of every Bitcoin transaction, and are called the blockchain.

If I google "ebay market cap" I get 76 billion dollars and googling for "paypal market cap" returns conservative estimates of 40 billion dollars. They are one company so you have to compare the 40 to 36 (where 36 is the value of ebay minus the value of paypal).
If you do not want to be conservative then those same google searches will reveal that Elon Musk, and other people who maybe know a thing or two, think Paypal would have a market cap in the 70 to 100 billion dollar range.
Additionally, I talk with employees from the La Vista Nebraska paypal facility frequently (it is just a few miles away from my home) and they treat statements such as "ebay was created as a way to popularize paypal payments", "paypal dwarfs ebay" and "paypal is payment platform and ebay is just a shopping site" as common knowledge that should be intuitively grasped.

I don't have links, but I would suggest you consider the state of the free market in the USA. Anything I will say can easily be checked and I don't think is controversial.
We have a ton of regulations to prevent problems. We have/had banking regulations to prevent 2007/8 style recession. We removed them before the recession and put them back after. These laws make the market a little less free and a little further from pure capitalism.
Going further back in time we had coal towns where people were functionally slaves and could only use their money in the company store. Laws that made the market slightly less free prevented this.
The Rockefellers had a steel monopoly until antitrust laws. Microsoft would have owned web browsers and operating systems if not for the DOJ interceding. AT&amp;T would have prevented cell phones to maintain their profit if not broken up by antitrust regulators. Now with fewer laws enforced we are seeing companies reconsolidate old power.
Capitalism and socialism both take a fair amount of propping up. There are tomes inches thick describing these laws in tiny fonts, there are so many. I think you just take the propping up the United States has done for granted.

If you put all your money in to a speculative investment, then you deserve to lose all your money. That said if you're saving small amount each month, even just a few dollars and then you put a portion of that savings into Bitcoin that can make a lot of sense even for people with lower income.

I am upvoting you and taking that question at face value. Because it is a hard to answer question.
Both Fiat and BTC have failing and possibilities. The government control around Fiat are double edged. It is unlikely the dollar or euro will collapse in the immediate future even if the worst happens around the current political climate in the US (and I mean worst, a full on civil war would devalue the money not collapse it). But smaller countries come and go as we have seen with Libya and Venezuela in recent years. Large governments have show incredible deftness in using their money to better their citizens' position.
Cryptocoins are so new we do not yet know all the risks and BTC has specific risks of its own. I pulled out a while ago when I thought a 51% attack was likely and now it seems very hard barring some new tech. What if Google or some research firm announces some new quantum chip that can do 50 petahashes/s. Is that likely I am not a quantum hardware engineer, so I must go with my gut and expert opinions and say this is not likely, but experts have been wrong.
It does look like BTC will appreciate with my level of experience, but then Fiat backed assets like common stock and bonds have a long history. I must admit the future is uncertain for both but the risks to are different. One has mainly political risk the other mainly technological risk.
I can't say which is more likely to collapse but I have no problem having my money split into a variety of assets I understand, some Fiat, some BTC and some durable resellable goods. It would be unlikely for me to lose all my assets or even significantly reduce my quality of life unless I am bodily injured..

I think you might be inadvertently creating a false dichotomy. I just meant that if you put all your eggs in one basket and that basket fails for whatever reason then all your eggs are gone. Consider diversifying and consider holding other things of value. 
A lot of very poor people would be better served by putting the money into their car, into a 401k, into Home Improvements, or just into the bank until they have something like an emergency fund. All that said it can be really hard for for people living paycheck-to-paycheck to say anything. For people in this situation it seems desirable to gamble at all and make it big, but most people won't most people will lose it because they've never done it before they don't have the experience to know how to react to small failures and they're likely to do something goofy like pull all their money out when the market goes down.

History. People trust history and demonstrated reliability, and it is implicit in so much that we do. We don't ask hard question about government firefighters, roads or other basic foundations of society because the history shows these work.
If that volatility is known to have bounds then it is not a major problem. If speculators do hodl they will push value up and convert speculation to value. Regulations are great when they prevent crime, but are not the only way BTC is a great experiment in whether a public ledger is good enough, and gold worked without regulations for a long time.
None of these obstacles are definite blockers for BTC, but they are things it must deal with to succeed. Whatever else can be said something definitely cannot improve by staying the same, so new things must be tried and BTC has a strong foundation for that new way forward, but nothing can be guaranteed.

I think you are going to needless extremes. No one brought up death.
We can play with words and definitions. We can make the USA a capitalist or not by that definition. Treating this as non-binary, as some kind of capitalizt gradient, seems best to me.
On that gradient it is clear that the US has moved around several times. It we try to plot personal freedom on a similar gradient it seems the US has moved several times as well. With times of coal-towns and Company stores being less free for individuals and more free for markets. 
It seems clear to me that unrestricted markets lead inevitably to some amount of restrictions on personal freedom. This is at least as bad choosing the extreme of no private control on industry. The big problem with this extreme is the ease of corruption gaining large amounts for small amounts of people that don't represent the population. 
It seems clear to me that the best choice is a mixture of socialism and capitalism where the government controls some things that aren't amenable to Private Industry and Private Industry controls things that are definitely amenable to it. Commodity Goods like toilet paper and computers clearly benefit from competition, but fire departments and police departments clearly don't. 
This is a system that most socialist States and most Capital states of settled on we just started it different extremes and workedtowards the middle.

They are humans too and they have specific goals, educating people and minimizing disruption to that process.

The first definition implies depriving the person you took it from of the item taken. Digital movies are copied without denying the creator their copy.
The second said "move". You can't "move" data, you can make copies and delete originals (when you use an mv or move command this is exactly what it does). Since the theaters still play movies and their get aired on tv we can be quite certain the originals were not deleted.
Beyond semantics you came to a group of people who had no ethical qualms with an actions and called them a thieves (people who steal).

Then the libertarians are greedy leeches. Here is a quote one such person's day:
this morning I was awoken by my alarm clock powered by the electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US department of energy. I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility. After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC regulated channels to see what the national weather service of oceanographic and atmospheric administration determined the weather was going to be like using satellites designed, built, and launched by the national aeronautics and space administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of US department of agriculture inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the food and drug administration.
At the appropriate time as regulated by the US congress and kept accurate by the national institute of standards and technology and the US naval observatory, I get into my national highway traffic safety administration approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built by the local, state, and federal departments of transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality determined by the environmental protection agency, using legal tender issued by the federal reserve bank. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the US postal service and drop the kids off at the public school.
After work, I drive my NHTSA car back home on the DOT roads, to a house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and fire marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all it's valuables thanks to the local police department.
I then log on the internet which was developed by the department of defense advanced research projects administration and post on freerepublic.com and fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right.

I dislike your use of the word "trust". If a device has been remotely rooted an attacker can do any manner of foul things to it including:  
  * Monitoring the whole email process and emulating it if it is done on the computer.
  * Perform in memory modifications of the target wallet in a transaction.
  * Since the machine is rooted, the attacker has access to all the keys used for encrypting network traffic and could spoof a validation from the server or redirect validation requests to a local proxy so the wallet owner never knows.


I am sure that adds a layer of security and makes it easier and less risky to trust a machine, but **it is impossible to securely use a machine as an endpoint which is not trustworthy**. This should not be advertised as doing such.
For typical computer use (social networking, photos, music, work, etc...) I would assume multifactor authentication to be plenty, but with a target potentially having hundreds of BTC (or thousands in select cases), an advanced persistent threat (someone skilled paying special malicious attention to you and your computer specifically) is possible threat that this angle of advertising ignore.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:31:46


No its not. Bitcoin and other digital coins are based entirely on digital security. Its when you add **lazy** humans to the mix that things get messy.
It is perfectly possible to have a secure system. You just can't be lazy in any step. Are you running any software you can't audit? Why do you trust you (or someone you hire/trrst) cannot verify? You have to use open source software (or something somone you hire/trustmade), there are several orders of magnitude of difference of malware issues on open source platforms when comparing apples to apple with closes sourced system. Please compare per capita malware numbers on servers, this will rule out lazy/uneducated users, and provide an even comparison.
This is where the lazy part comes in. Just because you run Linux or Android doesn't make you immune, it jut gives you a decent foundation. If you start installing closed sourced games, flash players, java vms, graphics card drivers, etc... you are adding unauditable things to you stack of software and trusting them implicitly with whatever security the OS gives them. For example, flash players have tons of flaws and run with the same permission as the logged in user. You are implicitly trusting a group who refuses to disclose their plans for streaming videos and displaying vector graphics despite there being no special technology here. What are they hiding? At a minimum they are hiding security holes.
Then you need to not be lazy about passwords and encryption, and you actually have to understand what is going on with each. If people with physical valuables are expected to understand physical security, why are people with digital expected to not understand digital security?
If I have gold I must either give it to someone I trust or protect it. Perhaps a safe a fence, a camera system, a plan. Why would someone with 1000s of BTC not invest the effort in understanding the digital equivalents? You do need all the math, but it might help. You truly need the concepts. You need to know what auditable means in this sense, to know the difference between a public and private key, to know the basics of the permissions an OS might have you manage. Not knowing these things are the equivalent of not knowing why it is bad to leave money in an ungaurded, unmonitored, unlocked trailer home in a bad part of town.

Imagine you are paid once a week. Each week you put $100 into something. When it is high you buy less, when it is low you buy more. This strategy is frequently recommended as part of stock buying plans for employees, so they can buy partial shares as part of a mutual fund. So the math works well with fractional shares.
Doing means that if *investment* costs $100 one week, and $10 the next that you would have 11 of *investment* after two weeks. It is an easy way to perform the *buy low* part of *buy low and sell high*. Because it is not known what the future price is. The investor simply lets the market decide. As long as *investment* goes up in the long run the investor makes money and takes advantage in price fluctuations along the way. When it is time to retire, or the investor decides the price is high enough, they sell. Even if *investment* goes down in price, because more of it was bought low and less high the losses will tend to be smaller, not eliminating but mitigating some risk.

A spread is the difference in price between current buy limit order and sell limit orders.
A limit order is an offer the sell something for price X. The opposite of a limit order is a market order. A market order is buying or selling at the best price currently available on the market.
 People can put orders in and say "I will buy 1 btc for 2 dollars" and someone might say "I will sell 0.1 btc for 2.10 dollars" and there would be a spread of 0.10 dollars.

I think I covered this already this. If that integer is in another bank's computer the money isn't literally made. At some wealth will need to be transferred otherwise that other bank will be pissed and take the money via legal action. Defaulting on credit works out pretty badly for banks too.
More likely these banks will have lots of transactions and they will each do the math on the sum of credits and sum of debits then swap  wealth equal to the difference. Different banks do this at different but monthly was once a common schedule for such reconciliation.
Please explain to me again how that is wealth creation, I might have missed something. Here is a situation simplified but analogous to my understanding: This seems a lot like me paying for a buddies soda at the vending machine, then my buddy eventually paying me back. But if the vending machine accepts a credit card and I pay a dollar from my credit card I am just changing an integer in the vending machine's account, but I still lose a dollar and expect one from my buddy.

True, I am just mining part time or opportunistically, when these are used for work (this work requires beefy GPUs). I don't see how this invalidates my opinions.
As far as risk assessment equipment purchase is rarely considered a "huge risk", you can rarely lose more than the cost. Compare this to stock options, or other heavily leveraged investments.
Edit - Another example of a huge risk for not a great investment is employees. Each employee could potentially turn out to be a thief, you might pay a great deal for them. there are strategies to mitigate this is clearly there are lots of employees out there, but any equipment is just not as big a deal as the people manning it.
From every business-minded standpoint mining equipment isn't the big risk.

Only if banks own both sides of the transaction. When I bought this house, the previous owner got money in their account at a different bank, they can withdraw it and use it all.
Presumably their bank does some fractional reserve stuff where they invest it and only keep some on hand, but it is not the outright fabrication of money that is the simplified meme around here.

That is literally the opposite of creating money. They write down that I owe X + interest in their ledge and give X to the other bank. The only thing created is interest and that is agreed upon up front.
The money creation thing only applies when they write down that I owe them X and they get to put some or all of X elsewhere, like investments.
EDIT - To highlight how this isn't creating money lets imagine this as a scenario without a bank but still having a lender.
If I am having lunch with a coworker and he forgets his wallet and his meal costs $10, I might offer to pay for him if he promises to pay me back when we get to the office. I give the restaurant $10 and get my $10 back at the office.
If we change this such that me and my coworker agrees he will pay me back $11 then that is $1 of interest and a $10 loan no money was created in either scenario.

Usury isn't fundamentally evil like you call out. If you lend someone money that you don't know so well, wouldn't you want them to pay for it? When people start giving out loans as a business in Bitcoin there will be interest.
I couldn't have bought my house or education without debt. I was fortunate enough to get great interest rates and I have the option of early payoff to minimize interest payments. Not everyone does, but in my previous housing situation saving was literally not an option and getting a house loan let me build savings two ways: my mortgage payment was cheaper and some portion of my payment is preserved in the house something I can sell later.
As for your questions, destroying fiat will be hard. I think the most permanent way will be to outcompete it permanently, because reissuing diat isn't expensive for a large corporation or small nation. Fiat has a decent history most places but if people would rather hold a deflationary currency in their pocket than an inflationary currency in a savings account that is good first step. No matter how it goes fiat is going to lose in pieces, already large international money transfer is easy in BTC than in fiat, what can BTC do better next?
The side effects are huge and depend on the order the utility of fiat fails. At some point people will offer loans and various kinds off accounts in  BTC. A BTC investment makes enough sense to me once BTC settles into some sane rate of value increase. Let's imagine BTC lands on the moon at 1 million usd/ btc, then the price stabilizes and increases at some steady rate. Perhaps 3% per year to keep this sane. People will skip fiat savings accounts with a lower yield, stocks not expected to grow at 4% are considered risky, companies lose the ability to issue low interest bonds, fiat mortgage rates go up because people will buy houses and pay mortgages in BTC and the lenders will want a fiat return larger than the BTC growth rate. There are a ton of effects, pretty much anything the Federal Reserve touches Bitcoin will touch but in a federated way.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:02:39
Debt allowed me options, and I use this option in several ways.
One way was that I took out a loan in fiat to buy bitcoin when low and will pay back when bitcoin is high ( could pay back now, but this seems like the start of a bull run, not the peak.
I am having a hard time seeing a situation where accepting a small risk (a loan) for a large possible gain (a well understood investment) won't be fundamental economics.
I agree deflationary money will have at least some emergent properties different from inflationary money, but I don't know enough to see the end ramifications. It very well could be the elimination of debt and leverage as a concept, but i see no practical way from here to there.

This is still just showing the risk as being the price of the equipment, and "sharing" that risk with victims. I was asking how this could be done as a legitimate business and not be evil and predatory, but what you are showing is that the risk is small proportional to the purchase and that there is no way this risk sharing is legit
This is the exact same risk a transport company takes with new vehicle purchases. The new vehicle might be a lemon and not work in that case they are out the cost of the vehicle and little else, neither of these is a huge risk.
Please compare this to short trading which is a huge risk because the possible amount of loss is unbounded and based on market fluctuation.

A merckle tree is a linked list where the next item to be linked in the list it's pointed to by a hash or a number that's predetermined when the node I. The list is made. In this case people who are mining bitcoins attempt to make blocks better pointed to buy the previous hash in the previous block. in the general case there's nothing preventing a block from having multiple pointers which is why they're called trees, but in bitcoin's case there's only one per block which is why chain instead of a tree.
Adding these blocks is functionally impossible from cryptographic point of view, which is why the difficulty exists which is the amount of bits that need to match in the next block to the previous hash. This difficulty scales with the amount of work Miner are doing.
When a Bitcoin miner successfully mines a new block they publish it and everyone can see that they have discovered the next node in the merkle tree. All miners are just attempting many thousands, millions, or billions of hashes per second on possible future blocks.
Merkle trees are more generic then the blockchain and the blockchain is one way to make a merckle tree. On their own, without a crypto coin a blockchain can be used to prove work or effort amongst multiple parties that equally distrust each other but trust math. Plenty of people are attempting to use blockchain technologies using different hashes and different technical details to share things like stock prices and contract fulfillment information. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is the largest use, but not nearly the only use of blockchains.
Consider reading the original Bitcoin white paper. This is all in there oh, and even Wikipedia has a decent page on blockchain and merkle trees.

I recently stepped into mining are the small investment of $4,000 in equipment. I can see how it is low risk/low reward, I'm not seeing how I can be more than the amount I paid for the equipment, and even then I can sell it. Even if I bought all that equipment on credit, the worst I might be out as $4,500.
I did buy it on credit, but I took a number of other steps to mitigate my risk. These machines will be dual or triple purpose. They will be workstations 4 for a company I partially own. Because the GPUs are powerful I can game on them (I even have the company permission to do this). When unused they are mining scrypt based coins.
My thought process it's pretty much that I'm going to be using these machines anyway, I can spend a few extra dollars on the GPU in each and after some math with my cost of electricity these might make the company a little bit of money on the side. 
We are getting solar panels soon which will do some other interesting things for the company finances. But even without that, or even without these workstations these two decisions make sense independently, they just synergize to make a ton of sense together.
It seems to me that it would be unwise to get into mining if someone didn't have some similar way of making it a good idea. Why would someone just buy $1,000 piece of mining equipment with no other purpose if they didn't have some cheap or free source of electricity? Even if they did their still just out the price the equipment, it's not "huge" risk.

I see wine saying things like this is popular here, but just doesn't match up with society's views on ownership.
The vast majority of society when it dries that people own fiat money if it's in a bank account under their name even though it's exposed all the same risks. 
Leaving your money in an account under someone else's control provides different risk exposure not additional risk exposure. If I keep my money all off the exchange and paper wallets I still have the risk of losing a paper or having a paper stolen from me. If I keep my money in an exchange that is trustworthy and there is a different profile for what kind of theft can happen.
This all means different things in different countries and jurisdictions. If I physically live in Venezuela and I'm using an exchange regulated there then clearly keeping money out of government control is good. If I'm in a relatively low crime area that is stable, and using an exchange in an area with sane financial regulation meeting the exchange isn't such a large, particularly when considering a huge amount of people with retirement accounts that measure in the hundreds of thousands or more.

Being easy to work is a and corrosion resistant is a common property, pewter, lead and tin all have those but more wars have been fought over gold. It is beautiful and inspires people to covet, This coveting in so many is what make it worth hundreds per troy ounce, otherwise dozens of other materials just as and having similar properties would have that value.

Have an upvote for playing semantics masterfully. Gold is backed by "nothing" because it is the "intrinsic value". Gold is the backing thing, because everyone wants it. It is of little use on its own, but because it is easy to sell, if retains usefulness as a store of value, just as bitcoin does.

This relative scarcity contributes to why gold retains value. We would not covet a common thing so easily as we covet gold.

I am not saying that is correct or incorrect.
To a person who requires evidence to believe the lack of citation and evidence is noteworthy. It cites no external sources and the only internal source it cites claimed bitcoin would keep going up from its peak at 1BTC for $1000 USD.

Log scales might provide that in some contexts, but I think using them here is not justified. Clearly the spike above $1,000 was unsustainable and at least partially bubble like.
I think most of the of log scale has not been to accurately portray order of magnitude as you have indicate, but rather cover the gigantic bubble from last year. People where posting plenty of linear charts before the drop and most indexes, like [Bitstamp]( use linear charts by default.
I think the love of log charts is primarily from some kind of echo chamber effect found on this subreddit.

When I buy a movie I should be able to skip to the movie.
It should not force me to watch advertisements, it should not accuse me of being a criminal, it should not stop working because I use equipment from the 'wrong' region. 
Games should not break my equipment because they swap out drivers for the sake of copy protection, games should not be scanning the process on my computer, games should not be phoning home with anything.
When movies, games and other digital products work, and work affordably, and work reliably, and work a fashion that is trustworthy, then piracy will stop. This is how every other industry must operate or be crushed by the free market.

Pretty much what said. The message has some obvious falsehoods and they should be removed, but any abstraction must reduce detail or tautologically its not more abstract.
 Look at the abstraction of a Car's steering wheel and gear shifter, they are not lying about the automatic transmission or engine underneath they simply omit presently irrelevant details. That abstraction allows me to drive a telsa or a ford despite huge differences in the tech.
To get people to at least know about bitcoin we will need to expose those that don't care with sounds bites of truth. "Bitcoin is an online currency", " Bitcoin is harder to track and regulate, than state backed currency" are good examples. They are mostly true, but ignore the details of storing bitcoins in paper wallets or how the block chain is public but doesn't tie to identity. If a person is interested in more detail we are here when they want to ask questions.

I think people have a short attention for things they don't care about. Most people simply don't care about any money not issued by their government.
Getting the idea that Bitcoin is a an online currency out there is harder than the idea it somehow relates to money.

You are fundamentally asking for a cost-benefit analysis. only getting a few sales through Bitcoin is fine if it cost you nothing to set it up. If it'll cost you a million dollars, then you need to ask how many sales you're going to get, if you're going to get half a million probably not worth it going to give 2 million definitely worth it.
Some points to consider:
When you do offer it you can plug it in bitcoin-related social places, like here. We welcome news like that, and that will get you at least a few sales, just like you're trying to get now.
It can be hard to measure sales you didn't receive, and you will certainly get more than 0 sales. Have you done surveys or research?
Bitcoin's value has been trending upward in the long term, do you plan on holding Bitcoin or are turning around and selling it for fiat hours instantly? Neither is wrong, but either affect your decision.
Will this extra set up require maintenance costs, or is it a one-time thing that you can set up and forget? If it only cost you $1 a month to maintain, then almost certainly it will pay off eventually, but if you're paying a fee for it because you outsourced it then it might not pay off.
Of course we here are going to tell you to do it, and I think you should do it because I think that BTC is going to appreciate a great deal and well one be the default way to move value on the internet.

Yes, but the error bars are so small that we can take it as a precise measurement.
It's sort of like claiming that there are so many grains of sand on a beach because you know how many pounds of sand there are the approximate number of grains because you counted the amount of grains in 10 lb. Yes, technically you have an estimate but it's so accurate it might be better than counting because the counting process will introduce errors.

Do you not know who Bolton is or how he is provoking iran and that Trump chose him?
Peaceful, war hawk, both modes have their uses. You bring up Bush's wars like they didn't have gigantic support at the time and after 9/11 there was going to be bloodshed. You bring up Obama's Libya as though it weren't important and effective.
Trump's provocation of Iran are useless and stupid, we had them contained peacefully with a global treating trump unilaterally ignored and started screwing with. President 45 had a good opportunity to skip wars that previous leaders would have had that because of what previous leaders had done.
Trump also didn't pull us out of any war and the conflicts we are in are bloodier and less restrained...
So now that we have debunked that in it's entirety, tariffs? You are seriously defending tariffs that are doing more harm than good, because that is what tariffs do in an strongly inter and intraconnected economy.
The price of BTC rising is at least partially because the dollar is in such a weaker position because of the tariffs that cost jobs and raise prices American poorest are paying.
