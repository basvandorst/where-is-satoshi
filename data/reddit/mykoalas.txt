If truth belittles you then maybe it's for the best. Considering how you refused to answer my question, the answer is mostly "no", or maybe you just don't understand it. If so, what's the point of arguing with someone about a topic they don't have a fundamental understanding of? I'm not going to make general statements about some straw-man you're going to construct. I want to talk to you about the facts plain and simple. I'm not saying you don't have a right to disagree, I just want to make sure you disagree for logical reasons, that's all.
