The article is still up, it was transferred to another website.
I did not compare the act of torture to a government being able to print its own currency. I said that money printing and cheap credit enables warfare, welfare, and subsidies by governments. Money printing by the Federal Reserve enables the US to have these massive welfare and warfare programs.

Let the market decide what size the blocks would need to be.

Of course past performance is no guarantee. However you don't need to look at PM past performance to know that they are a great preservation of wealth over the long-run.
Less than 40% of gold is used for "investment" or "preservation of wealth purposes" nowadays. I don't see gold as "money" anymore. However I see a need for transactions off the blockchain to occur, which PM are perfect for. The physical attributes of PM also make them a great store of wealth, even in the future. Heck, bitcoin wouldn't exist without the physical attributes of gold, silver, and copper.

Why not? Precious metals are a great preservation of wealth over the long-run.

PM's are a commodity. All the dealers get them from the same place. Margins are extremely thin on bullion.

As a precious metals dealer myself, I suggest you check your numbers. As of right now 10% of gold is used in industry, and over 50% in jewelry. Just because gold is not money, does not mean it's not a storage of wealth, which it has been, even when it hasn't been considered money.
I'm not referring to brick and mortar retail transactions, or anything along those lines...Why would someone want transactions off the blockchain to be digital? I think that defeats the purpose of being off the blockchain.

Actually, the life expectancy was 35-40 in the US 150 years ago, and has since doubled because of these types of marginal changes. It's even stated in the following sentence that the changes are only marginal. Those changes can compound, though.

Most sovereign coins are sold over spot from the various Mints. Usually dealers get product under spot if they're buying from the second hand market. If they buy from a private mint they are getting it at or just above spot.

I didn't hear your heckle last year =/
I can pay for most of my expenses in bitcoin now. Every employee at Amagi receives some portion of their salary in bitcoin. In 6 months, many of our vendors will be accepting bitcoin too. They like what we're doing. It's not crazy to think that in 2 years from now we will be working only in crypto (excluding any taxes that we pay). Especially as bitcoin adoption continues to grow.

Considering precious metals companies only make $10 per ounce of gold...

I've been a huge advocate of this in CO.
However marijuana is illegal at the federal level. Payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase are staying as far away from this industry as possible since it is still illegal.
The MJ industry is very skeptical of bitcoin, and throw up a wall every time it is talked about. I think a lot of people in the MJ industry have been in the industry for a long time, even before it was legalized. They are older, and seem to be more skeptical of technology as well.
If I had to guess, they are also trying to develop reputable, legitimate businesses, and do not want to be associated with the SR in any way.

Why on earth would you want to buy bitcoin on Coinbase?

Trading privacy and economic prosperity/freedom for national security. He even understands that the market wants to move toward encryption, and yet wants to stop it.
They don't think that criminals are already using encryption?

Incorrect. Overstock.com offers to pay employees in bitcoin. If I had to guess, Microsoft and Dell have some, just to check it out. No idea about Expedia.

Provident Metals started accepting bitcoin two weeks after I told them about our successes with accepting bitcoin at Amagi Metals.

Less investment isn't necessarily bad. In fact, I would say he means less malinvestment. Which is a good thing.
