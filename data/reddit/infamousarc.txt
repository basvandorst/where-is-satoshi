How these sites operate is that they pay the first investors by the new deposits of newer investors, until they can't pay anyone anymore and they shut down. So there will be two different people who would engage in this; experienced investors who will join first and refer other people, and the latter who are dumb enough to think that this would last and throw all their savings into it.  
Basically you won't need to lookup their wallet, i'm sure it's pretty full!
