Approved virtual currencies might not include bitcoin. Seems strange for them to ban bitcoin only to allow it later on. Perhaps they will introduce their own virtual currency?

Everything about this from the car to the photography to the website is insanely well presented and polished. I just came here to say bravo, and best of luck with the sale!

Is it really unlimited amounts? Wouldn't it be 21 million x value?

Won't this only become relevant once rewards for finding blocks drops significantly? In the scenario they described, they almost completely ignored that reward, treating it as though it doesn't exist.

Yeah, what I was getting at though was that if this were to be used at a metacurrency, the value would be a huge factor. Even if the value stabilizes, huge value transactions can't really happen, unless we were lucky enough to have the value go way up. $10,000 could be easily transferred from country to country via bitcoins, but $10,000,000,000? The bitcoin wasn't designed to be a metacurrency, as far as I can tell. It was designed to be independent, so that all transactions use bitcoins, and they have an inherent value, not the value of their conversion rate to the most popular currency. Just my 2 cents. I think it's fine for smaller transactions as a metacurrency, but the 21 million bitcoin hard limit was put there because it is supposed to have a value of its own, I think. Then again, I have no schooling on these things, I'm just spewing what comes to mind here.

Other exchanges that I've used with success since leaving mtgox: campbx and intersango. Both were fine for my needs.
