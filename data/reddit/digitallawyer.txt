Nice, was not aware of this resource. This will be helpful to include!

I'd love to know how they came up with that name.

Yes. Coinbase is not an option even if you use Tor, I believe. You still need to identify yourself to Coinbase in order to do transactions. That's called KYC ("know your customer"). Even if you get through, if you falsify your information your account might get affected later.   
You used to be able to buy in person without KYC through localbitcoins, but that too is history.

Here's a free book on Bitcoin if you want to dive into it

Read up first before buying! Easy to lose your funds.

Hmmm. I see what you mean... [

Nah. You're not stupid. You're just one of the early adopters of an exciting new technology.

You buy bitcoin and send it to your wallet?

Hi Marco! I left my name and number with the person at the front desk. Look forward to talking.

Thanks! Offering the same if you ever need a space in San Francisco. We're committed to supporting the cryptocurrency community in every way we can.
Two ways to help: 
* would love any comments around improvements we could make to the guide.
* share with anyone you think may be interested! 
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:40:43
Because of the centralized nature of the services?

Just an impromptu experiment. The Eviction Defense Collaborative in SF does great work and can use our support.

As far as we are aware, no official statement has been released. As you may know, other Bar associations, such as the Israeli one, have been moving faster on the subject.
That being said, the ABA website hosts several publications related to Bitcoin / Cryptocurrencies, so it is definitely on their radar:
* [Some basic rules for using Bitcoin as virtual money](
* [Challenges of bitcoin use, regulation discussed by experts](
* [Bitcoin as payment in small law firms](

Hi bitbybitbybitcoin, what does the term "crimson implosion" refer to? I'm not familiar. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:54:11
Thanks!

People thought that the internet would be government proof. Lots of books on how we would need a completely different set of laws.
Not. Just regulating the access points (ISPs in case of the internet, exchanges in case of crypto) goes a very long way. I trust that we'all see the same thing happening again in this case.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:06:53
Good point, that is true. Maybe it cannot be controlled as a result. I'm trying to think about a situation where on the one hand, you control the ISP, and on the other hand, you make it extremely impractical or even illegal to transact through other channels. Seems like this could be hard to pull off.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:46:31
Also commented on the tweet. I had not thought about this, but this is an interesting thought and seems like a tangible risk for Bitcoin and the wider crypto community. Or is this scenario unlikely, because it is easy to mask transactions or other activity?
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:56:00
"Bitcoin remains completely unaffected thanks to its decentralized nature"
Hmmm. Is this fact? Say an ISP had a de-facto or actual monopoly in an area, could they not interfere and charge for transactions or other crypto-related activity? Genuinely wondering. (Saw this post right after posting [this](

You just wait until the meatcoin ICO blows up. Also, I agree. 
Your workflow sounds right for a point of sale context. I would also imagine:

Cool, thx for the feedback. It's a matter of intent I'd say. I updated my comment to reflect this and your feedback. "This is in no way intended as a scam, but the prudent thing would be to treat it as one."

Looks like nothing has ever been there. Registered in 2008 (when the ccTLD for Montenegro was fist made available at various registrars).

Upvoted, I agree that caution is warranted. The addresses are real but this is nothing but a rought draft and the connection is not even secured via https. The reason is that Github Pages, where I am hosting this simple setup, does not allow you to do so when you use a custom domain. I'm not asking or recommending that this set of pages is used to send any actual currencies. This is in no way intended as a scam, but the prudent thing would be to treat it as one.
I thought that this was a concept that would be of interest, wasn't sure where to post. I was just asking myself how something quite as complex as cryptocurrencies could be simplified to the level that anyone could setup a wallet, share a payment address, and engage with the community. This is my Sunday exploration of that...
I got a little carried away I guess :-)

I was afraid you might notice that. I might have to postpone further development until @ becomes a valid character in domain names.
