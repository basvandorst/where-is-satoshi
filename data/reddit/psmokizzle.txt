He used the Swiss Bank analogy because Swiss Banks were historically neutral-uncooperative when it came to cooperating with US authorities. He didn't mention Bitcoin or digital currencies, and he contextualized it when he lumped the Swiss Bank people with other criminal offenders. You can call me whatever names you want, but I still think OP extrapolated the title for karma.

MFW person uses government-developed technology to buy digital currency, probably drove roads, ate food or shat using products that were government-funded, employed numerous other services subsidized/ provided by the government (social pressures reinforced by laws that discourages being killed in the street included), and tries to dodge paying for the government services they've taken for granted

Moving to a Bitcoin wallet...
So if you don't have a card that works on Circle, why did you keep using it as opposed to another wallet?

Now let's get some nation-state friendly use cases mixed into this Hype Fuel to sustain the demand
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:11:32
Lol you must hate applicable use cases in legislated  lands driving the price of your cryptocurrencies up, and where else do you complain about it but using tech that was developed by the government
I'm not saying that companies like GDAX and Circle can never do wrong, I'm saying that in order for Bitcoin to not fall into illegitimacy (and therefore in value) it needs use cases. Since most of the world that can utilize cryptocurrencies are in governed nations, there needs to make use cases that apply and are at least accepted by the governing bodies of  those peeps. Otherwise Bitcoin becomes the Nigerian Prince email of yesteryear (maybe not that bad, but you see what I mean)
@_date: 2016-06-30 00:23:55
Moving the funds to a Bitcoin wallet means that you send them (the same way people send you funds, and how you likely sent the funds into Circle) to a service that holds Bitcoin.
What I don't understand is why you'd use a digital currency to trade and hold funds if you didn't understand it, how it works, how other companies that make things accessible also have compliance and regulatory issues with other countries, etc. 
My other questions are:
1. What's the most popular option? 
2. If it's PayPal, why don't you have access to something that would potentially protect you or people you sell to from scams and misrepresented products?
SFYL, but this seems like a huge oversight; if I'm using a currency for merchant services, I'd try to learn as much as I could so that I wouldn't have issues accessing my funds. If it's fiat, that means a bank and PayPal for Buyer Protection. If it's Bitcoin, that means a wallet and an understanding of how other Bitcoin companies operate (a lot of legal grey areas depending on the country).
@_date: 2016-06-10 01:57:51
Is it any wonder that banks are still closing people's accounts for transacting with unlicensed Bitcoin services?
If you like the idea of your Bitcoin doubling in value, then you like moderate adoption. You'll like moderate adoption because it puts some tangible buffering between people buying Bitcoin purely for speculation, and more transactions lead to more improvements. More regulation means more people in more countries can legitimately use Bitcoin without being looked at like a criminal or getting their bank accounts shut down.
TL;DR If companies didn't bridge the gap between regulation and innovation during the early days of the Internet, there wouldn't be a Reddit for you to post on
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:39:46
Of course it will. The real question is:


@_date: 2016-06-23 16:00:44
In their defense, if they prompted you to put your real information at any point when you weren't using their service (i.e a system sweep for name/ bank account mismatches), wouldn't you be bitching about them prying into your business without your consent?
Regardless, PayPal only deals with "compliance government" bitches; companies that like being in business comply with regulations pursuant to the nation(s) in which they operate, and those companies that like being in business like working with like-minded companies who like being in business. Funny how things work
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:20:26
So vote in government elections. You already vote with your actions; if you hold fiat, you're inadvertently voting for it. Same with cryptocurrencies.
If you believe that your government wastes money, then vote for people that will not waste money on wars and unnecessary expenses. Vote for the people who will give back. And if there aren't any, be one.

Lol there are more than one companies that want to be or already are licensed Bitcoin exchanges
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:49:49
BitLicense, actually complying with local and federal regulations/making them define what Bitcoin is so they can be licensed in the US/UK?
Doesn't seem much for tax evaders and drug enthusiasts, but  making any kind of path makes it easier for other companies that want to be in the space in the future.
Now they're supposedly building an open source settlement platform using Bitcoin; they saidbuying/selling didn't "achieve their goals", and people thought it was the IRS, an orchestrated plan, basically whatever fits their worldview best. Most people on this subreddit dont like companies that work with compliance, so I can see how they'd want Circle to burn for it, long after they cease to be relevant for this sub
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:17:20
Following that same line of logic, PayPal is a fiat exchange, as are Dwolla, Venmo, Tilt, Square (when they're up and running in the UK) and others that have support for exchanging a currency recognized in one context to a currency recognized in another context. I'm going by what they called themselves, as Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, and others call themselves exchanges.
The ability to do something doesn't define a business; it defines what functionality you used. I could use a business PayPal account for payroll, but it's far from an HR app.
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:29:36
Lol not at all.
I'm talking about transactions with hundreds of confirmations being disputed by a bank because of fraud/ some person sending to MMM. Banks don't understand blockchain.info and (have fair reason to) believe that Bitcoin is reserved for people scamming other people and illegal stuff. 
Services like PayPal are able to provide Buyer Protection because they can penalize bad merchants with bans, negative balances, etc (and have enough capital to reimburse customers). The only companies with enough capital to shoulder the risk of complete merchant support see it as a waste of money on a currency full of illegal activity. BTC companies likely do that on purpose because once they make it easy to pay merchants, they'll lose their fiat payment processors from chargebacks faster than you can say "Craig Wright sent me some dogecoin."
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:38:20
I see what you're trying to do, and it's admirable. That said, I don't think you're one to equate a currency as complex as Bitcoin with serving some pizzas in an arcade ;)
On that note, if they weren't driving a profit selling pizza, people were messy with pizzas and joysticks, and people got drunk and vomited pizza gunk frequently, I wouldn't blame them for dropping pizzas if they could set up some VR rigs.

I see where you're coming from; sometimes, when I see people excited for something I don't like, I think they're insane.
What I've found is that the beauty of the human condition means that there are people who have vastly different experiences, lifestyles, and viewpoints from mine. That doesn't make their opinion any more or less human than what I think. Same goes with the difference between 1-star reviews that speak counter to my experiences with Circle, and 5-star reviews that speak counter to yours, and other disgruntled Bitcoiners. 
It seems that the hang-up is that you feel disgruntled that Circle was operating in a space that let you circumvent the AML/KYC requirements and wait times of exchanges, to the point where you believe that no one in the world could like Circle post-Bitcoin. If that's the case, I doubt you would say anything different if they left 4 or 3-star reviews instead of 5.
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:21:00
People say "sure you can use Bitcoin! I use it a lot via [insert Bitcoin debit card or service that shoehorns into online shopping platforms]" which is cool and all, but that's it. 
The facts are that [articles like this]( are not helping, and when you take a look at how the public consensus of Bitcoin is seeped with either negativity or illegal behavior, you'll see things like this 7 years out. Hell, the issues with the DAO right after those articles about it being the highest-paid crowdfunding in recent history doesn't inspire confidence in cryptocurrencies either. 
People who use Bitcoin have a plethora of different opinions of how they plan for it to grow. Mining is useful, because someone's got to do it. Trading is something that comes with all currencies. Speculation means that there needs to be some intrinsic value behind it. When you look at gold, there are centuries (if not millennia) of genuine use cases and a definite scarcity, with value to this day. 
Does Bitcoin have use cases? Of course!
Do these use cases adhere to the laws in which its users reside? Not always!
Do the alternatives to Bitcoin adhere to local laws? A little more so~
I think that's the issue; there's not a vendor or company out there using the blockchain in a way that doesn't either co-opt Bitcoin tech hype for B2B sales or doesn't allow drug money or selling currencies for a profit (which are both technically illegal in the US).
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:38:22
I know, right? Have you seen these shillers' comments? And no one can succinctly answer his concerns about how Bitcoin at this point is structured like a Ponzi without saying:

@_date: 2017-01-05 22:37:54
That's a symptom, but there's also risk. People can, will, and persistently do lie; an internet-based currency arguably encourages that. 
At its best, Bitcoin's irreversible nature encourages kids to buy stolen cards on the internet, use TOR, clean their tracks, and get free money. 
At its worst, shitty betters will wait until 89 days after they buy 15 bitcoin, wake up in a "fugue state", and state that they've had their identity stolen and didn't authorize anything. Frankly, why would any company want to deal with either of that and not charge excessive fees to cushion that (as exchanges do)?
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:33:57
They never were the only pizza shop, there are bonafide pizza shops all around them that you can use, and you can also make the pizza yourself (buy P2P). As I said, your analogy failed to acknowledge that Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, and (just after Circle) Uphold let you buy/sell Bitcoin while Circle did it. 
As sad as you are about Circle leaving, this 1-star brigade that's trying to invalidate people liking Circle for non-Bitcoin reasons isn't going to make them bring back Bitcoin. Hell, it'll make sure no future company that isn't profiting from buy/selling Bitcoin ever offers liquidity without fees, delays, and exchange-level PII requests.
Going back to the incomplete analogy, if a group of people who were using pizza to trade with locals for drugs and illegal shit brigaded for an arcade to get shut down, the other pizza shops are in an even better position to raise fees, extend wait times, and do other things that fall outside of the analogy that make enjoying pizza a shitty experience.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:31:41
Aren't they still using Bitcoin to "complete some of God's work" with Spark though?
Also, I saw the video that the first link quoted; it's arguably bold to say that the space will change past Bitcoin, but it's a comparison some will make if people want to call Bitcoin the "Internet of Money" (someone should make a book about that). Considering the way the Internet works has changed in the past two decades, one could argue what he said has some validity. 
Maybe the Bitcoin/IoM platform we're using in 5-10 year's time was forked from Bitcoin, with a lot of changes in its protocol between then and now. I'd like to think that's what he meant, but I can also see why shillers would want to spin that as anti-Bitcoin.

ITT people who ignored the writing on the wall, shilled Circle as a messiah for easy liquidity, and had their hopes dashed when Circle said "nah."
Your opinions are given value on the App Store, and people are entitled to letting other people know when a feature they use is removed. They also help paint a picture that makes BTC users look petty, especially when you guys were using Circle for something that wasn't their goal. 
Maybe they'll be able to use the bandwidth freed from supporting gamblers and viagra buyers with "offshore accounts" and develop something that provides use for BTC outside of speculation and buying illegal stuff, despite r/bitcoin sabotage. 
Maybe not, and a company with the licenses and general OK from governments won't soon replace Circle. This is my fear, because I liked instant buying with low-to-no fees, and I can see why Circle removed it. Why would any new non-exchange without a death wish even considering filling Circle's vacuum, if this is what happens when they remove it?  
Maybe a temporary middle-of-the-road response to integrating Bitcoin and fiat in order to put crypto in a better position worldwide is a necessary evil; maybe it's a bad idea. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:27:57
With the same logic you applied to Circle, they would be. Despite the fact that they don't market themselves as exchanges, your use patterns would override that.

@_date: 2017-01-09 03:43:32
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, and creating a dichotomy people who did vs. don't use Circle for Bitcoin. It seems you can use it like a US&lt;-&gt;UK/Ireland Venmo. If that's what they're focusing on after pivoting from Bitcoin, and if that's what the people reviewing it are using, what authority are you invoking in order to invalidate their experiences?
Assuming you're not, then you're functioning on the premise that the only person who would rate Circle higher than 1-star has to be getting bribed. What about the people that changed their review from 5 stars to 1 star; were they initially bribed to say how convenient instant bitcoin was? If so, why are they commenting about how sad they are about Bitcoin getting cut, instead of how much Circle bribed them to shill about Bitcoin?
While I can see how it can be frustrating to see someone use and enjoy a product for reasons outside of your experiences, calling 5-star reviewers paid shills only when they speak outside of your experience seems hypocritical. I bet the people who don't know about/regularly use Bitcoin will look at the 1-star reviews and think a bunch of trolls got bored one Sunday and started a brigade.

And I'm not sure if they're throwing rage quits; they sent an email, had a blog post, and now we wait to see if Spark's worth anything. The people spinning this as anti-Bitcoin seem to be people who were either looking for easy liquidity, or lazy journalists that thought an article implying they were giving up on BTC is worth more in ad revenue than an article that implies Bitcoin has multiple use cases and Circle is going to try and refine one.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:43:12
They're a "social payments app," according to them. Everyone on r/Bitcoin used them as an exchange.
They had buy/sell support, and were insured/had the "A OK" from all 50 states and the UK. People tried to call them the savior of Bitcoin that was supposed to make Bitcoin adoption rates skyrocket.
But they didn't, probably spent a lot of money trying, and stopped buy/sell support a month ago. Guys like keep the Circle app installed so that they can keep giving 1-star reviews and brigading for more people to waste time and energy beating a dead horse.
What makes people mad is that they're not 100% dumping Bitcoin, because they claim they're building an open-source blockchain protocol called Spark that'll use crypto to beat shitty FX rates. So the r/bitcoin community doesn't know how to internalize it; Circle is in a good position to build a legal use case (value goes up), but they were an easy means of buying/selling Bitcoin (easy liquidity). Most people care less about the long-term value of Bitcoin, and want free liquidity (since exchanges charge fees to offset fraud losses).
There were also comments from Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, that r/bitcoin read as anti-Core. He talked about conflicts between Core devs regarding blocksize limits (r/bitcoin doesn't tolerate Core developer criticisms as much as r/btc), and at a conference said that Bitcoin would potentially not be used in 5-10 years. I assumed he posited we'd be using something built on top of Bitcoin, but I can see how some people could interpret that as a condemnation. But hey, building Spark seems like they're trying to take action instead of waiting for Bitcoin to be the platform they want it to be.
TL;DR they were nice, when you could buy/sell. They cut buy/sell in order to build a Bitcoin/crypto-based settlement platform. A lot of people only heard about them in a buy/sell context, so they think that people using them for Spark are lying.
@_date: 2017-01-08 18:54:31
Interesting points here; what makes the dozens of 1-star reviews any realer than the slew of 5-star reviews?  Maybe they reached out to a couple of people who weren't using them for Bitcoin, and asked them to leave a review. 
Wait, what am I saying? Bitcoin can't be used for fiat exchange rate upheaval! Only for buying sex toys in the Middle East, viagra placebos, poker chips, and alpaca socks to keep you warm when the PBOC pops a bull run and you can't afford to keep your ASIC rig running.

Fair prophesy. If they set out to become an arcade, had pizza because they thought everyone who likes arcades liked pizza, but realized that it's not worth their time, they have a right to cut it.
The analogy falls short because a lot of people in Western societies favor pizza, and don't associate it with illicit activities. To extend the lack of mainstream consumer adoption in your analogy, you'd either have to change the location to a town where people were vegans, didn't know how to eat pizza, or hadn't heard of it. Additionally, there'd need to be other places to get pizza in this town, but it takes longer to bake, is more expensive over there, and the pizza is used sometimes to pay locals to get drugs for you.
Do you want it to die, though? They are one of two companies with a BitLicense, and a license to operate in all of the countries where they officially launched simultaneously. 
More importantly, if the arcade got shut down because of 1-star reviews and people started protesting in front of the arcade post-pizza to drive people away, what arcade would want to take their place?

The assumption there is that Bitcoin can and will reach market saturation when fiat isn't needed. How will it do that, when one of the more common legal arguments I've seen for buying Bitcoin is speculation? If everyone buys it hoping to be the next rich person, and no one is richer for it, what will happen to the price?
Bitcoin is too volatile and unprepared on a technical level to shoulder the world's transactions. There are two agendas at play here:
1) people shilling for BTC price to rise, and telling people to buy into it because it's outperformed all other currencies (spec/trading)
2) people shilling for BTC use as a currency, which will be shit in the world of CNP transactions, buyer protections, and human nature. Who/what validates a transaction of goods or services went through, Scout's honor? 
Why would card networks let people buy Bitcoin when a string of butters find out ways to defraud their banks and try to get free Bitcoin? What happens when they're not disputing because people keep getting scammed, and the shillers don't have a means of identifying scammers so the same 50 scammers burn hundreds of potential good peeps from Bitcoin? Why would people then go to LBC, where there are huge premiums, the same chance of getting scammed, and the chance that you're providing liquidity to a money launderer?
It's a nice hope, but the Bitcoin blockchain is not ready for the world to buy into. What non-gambling/drug purchasing person in the Western world (where liquidity is highest, and more people can buy and hold BTC) would give up the safety net of buyer protections, cash back (inb4 "BTC price rises", I'm talking about BTC as a stable currency), and loss prevention?

You can still use it for good FX rates and stuff like that (I'm guessing that's where they're using Bitcoin), but the most vocal people on this subreddit/ their app store reviews can't seem to fathom that Circle could be anything else but what they as a community deemed it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:57:12
Hell, the beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't even have to use Coinbase; you can trade dirty fiat with your local gambling addict/drug-and-novelty ID entrepreneur via LBC!
For what it's worth, it looks like they're among the many peeps trying to build legal use cases, so that panic sells and exchange hacks don't drop the price. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:49:47
They were never an exchange though; if you want instant Bitcoin reach out to traders for OTC arrangements.
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:55:48


Isn't that the same thing?
Also, I've only seen "Bitcoin" and Circle in the same sentence on this website, on sites that aggregate exchanges based on country (where I heard about it), and news articles shilling for Bitcoin. I've personally never seen the word Bitcoin on their front page in the last year. 
Where'd you see that Circle was advertising Bitcoin buy/selling?
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:32:34
So which is it: butthurt because they legally can't delete your PII, or because you can't buy/sell anymore?
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:23:45
The same reason you did.
They asked, when I signed up, so I submitted an ID. I wanted higher limits, so I sent in a little more for that. 
I was using it to send Bitcoin to mPesa to convert to my relatives' local currency, because fuck WU/Moneygram fees. It worked, and that seems to be what they ideally want to do so they told me that they'll look into partnerships with companies like mPesa. In the meantime, the fees from Coinbase and Gemini aren't too shitty for me to want to go back to WU. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:25:52
And now, for non-investment advice:
Don't buy from random-ass websites or strangers on the internet/Craigslist because *Bitcoin has no buyer protection*. No matter what they tell you, Bitcoin isn't a "safe" currency for buying concert (Coachella) tickets/iPhones/TVs/hot new shit for cheap.
It's only "safe" for the recipient, so when you get ghosted after 5 confirmations, you can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:54:59
Circle was like Venmo with Bitcoin support, but r/Bitcoin had a love/hate relationship.
People bitched about review timelines for AML/KYC, as though they should be able to provide AMA-esque screenshots to buy a digital currency used for human trafficking. 
Now that buy/sell is gone, people are inconvenienced, but there have always been about half a dozen centralized and P2P exchanges in Western countries. If you weren't in the US/UK, I don't even think you could use Circle, so it's like crying over a goat falling off of a Haitian mountain.
It's also peeps like OP bringing this up 4 times in a week in order to brigade. It's possible that the people leaving 1-star reviews think that they'll bring Bitcoin back, when it's the equivalent of keying your ex-boy/girlfriend's car a month after a break up.

Good points; I can see that reviews that are extreme and seemingly fake should be stopped. I got an email when they cut Bitcoin support, was bummed, so I called and asked what the deal was. I got decent answers, so I'm on Gemini and Coinbase. 
With that in mind, now that they've taken out buy/sell support, wouldn't it make sense for them to buckle down on their other competencies? If they have easy USD/Euro/GBP liquidity, they should definitely tell people to test that out, see if they like it, and talk about it. If that's not your cup of tea, uninstall.  
How are the reviews about past features being removed realer than 5-star reviews about things they have?
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:35:00
Because they were a Venmo with Bitcoin functionality thrown in on the side?
Fixing the problem would be bringing back Bitcoin, but now there's no logical way for them to do so. OP is the final nail in the coffin; no company would set the precedent of bringing back Bitcoin after a slew of 1 star reviews, and accusations that anyone who isn't using them for Bitcoin has to be lying.
It's kind of insane if they did.

You're generalizing, but I'll bite. Another definition of brigading is "to make known," but [the objectives are a little different.](
Yeah, they legally can't delete that stuff for a few years on the off-chance they get audited and FinCEN knows someone who committed financial crimes had a Circle account. I don't make money breaking local or federal laws, nor do I plan to, so I'm not one to freak out. If the concern is about them getting hacked, the answer to that is to not use an exchange for your Bitcoin. Use Bitsquare or LBC. Additionally, would anyone have a need to hack them, now that they don't have Bitcoin support?
Otherwise, some Walter White wannabe in the Rockies can say "delete my information or I'll sue" and move to Europe, so when federal agencies come calling and the trail's cold, Circle would be held legally responsible for that.

1. You didn't address the fact that it's ruining housing markets, at all.

They care more than you do, because they have thousands of people like you, and more valuable than you.

I do like that you started with Amazon, but am disappointed that you didn't clarify. 
Using Bitcoin with Amazon is only possible through services where you can buy/sell Bitcoin for Amazon gift cards. Since a lot of services that sell gift cards (Amazon included) don't have a means of shutting down gift cards after people dispute the purchase that loaded the card, selling Bitcoin for gift cards is a means of liquidating fraudulently attained goods.
Why else would one see someone offering $200 worth of restaurant gift cards for $15-$60 in bitcoin?

A reasonable response is that they probably saw some illegal shit and had to close it. Coinbase and Circle are licensed and regulated, so if they see sketchy shit they have to cover their asses. Sign up for an exchange if you're salty; this tinfoil hatter posts dozens of them on a weekly basis

How would a credit service work with Bitcoin? What's stopping someone from taking advantage of the fact that they don't need to pay it back, and how do you make sure they pay back their monthly balance? If someone defaults, or uses a stolen identity to apply for credit, how do you get back those funds? Scout's honor only goes so far.
My thing is that there has to be something new, neat, and better than what's available. If it doesn't connect to legacy fiat systems, what would make your service more appealing than a wallet where they own the private keys?

This is the real question: without charging fees aside from CC fees and a mark-up from market rate (through that logic, Paxful and LBC are full of fees), and being one of the only BTC services with dedicated phone support, did they make more money from arbitrage than they lost in wages for manning a support/risk team?
Goldman Sachs reps are probably on their board, along with smart people from China. I don't think they'd just cut BTC support without weighing options and sunk man-hours
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:56:08
Airbnb might care? It couldn't be good for PR if the people using Bitcoin as a method for payment were tied to gambling, drug dealing, human trafficking, or were career scammers/fraudsters. 
One could argue that Airbnb shouldn't care, but that's not how laws work. LEOs and lawyers will just email Airbnb and make a big stink about the millennial Walter White of fake ecstasy hopping across Asia and the Mediterranean using only Bitcoin, and Airbnb was none the wiser.

I'd blame r/Bitcoin for trying to make it their messiah for liquidity when they only supported Bitcoin for remittance use cases, especially when Circle likes regulation and mass adoption and r/bitcoin hates it.

You're not Walter White, don't kid yourself haha
For thousands of years, the judicial systems were also different. Different societies (read: non-white ones) had different ways of handling credit, and communities were small enough where you generally knew most of the people you interacted with. They also had ways to deal with criminals, so if someone did something bad enough, they'd exile them, kill them, or maybe even make them walk into a body-shapped hole in the wall.
With the way the world is globalized, a fraudster could potentially commit tens of thousands in fraud, get a new identity, and try again in a country that doesn't extradite. 
Naturally, the governments ruled that that's a dick move. Also, AML/KYC serves to help investigations on the off chance that the mom and pop pizza shop isn't the clean integration/output of a child trafficking ring

@_date: 2016-12-14 22:03:04
I have no idea how lean they're running; it seems that a lot of people, yourself included, assumed that they were trying to run a brokerage when Allaire's comments clearly indicate they're not. It seems like they're trying to make a framework for the Internet of Money (what ever that is), which doesn't necessarily involve high profits, especially with dwindling FX markets.
Phone support makes sense if you're making an easy-to-use service helping a friend or family member send money to someone they know using Bitcoin, but not when every fake drug/steroid/fake ID/gambling site tells people to use Circle because it's easier than Coinbase (they didn't say all that, but those are most of the subreddits that talk about bitcoin as a non-speculative use case). Shame on Circle for assuming people wouldn't abuse their simplicity.
When you're talking about Bitcoin there are no "should be" situations; it's a digital currency that can be used to liquidate scam, drug/human trifficked, or fraud-related funds. When you're an average person that gets told to pay for a cheap iPhone through Kraken or Coinbase via Bitcoin, and the person runs off with the money, you're going to associated Bitcoin with scams. 
I feel like this space never discusses that, unless a CEO scams people or SEO leads to fake wallet ads floating above real wallets. Along with that, the blocksize debate "should have been" solved months ago, and at least one legal, non-speculative use case "should be" on its way to mass adoption by now. This space has no room for "should be"; even Circle recognizes that, and seems to be buckling down to contribute to the space.
From what I understood when I called, along with the email they sent out, Bitcoin buying and selling was a means for people to send and receive from other Circle-esque companies around the world in the form of Bitcoin. It sounds like r/Bitcoin assumed that because Circle allowed for the buy/sell of Bitcoin that they're an exchange/brokerage, and are throwing a hissy fit now that they want to spend resources developing open source things with Bitcoin on the backend.

If that were true, companies like Chainalysis would make no money. Companies care about that shit. Illegal business trades typically lead to money laundering (cuz drug/human traffickers have materialistic itches, too!). 
A Bitcoin merchant would be in a shit position if someone was a frequent buyer, only to find out they sent DNM profits to buy from them on OpenBazaar, sold it on eBay/Amazon/OpenBazaar for a different currency, and was able to liquidate it today.
You can say that issue exists with fiat, and it's true. That doesn't mean government agencies will let potential money laundering vectors grow out of laziness.

Nah, but they'll probably talk to Allaire or anyone familiar with the space, and see that the most vocal participators within the Bitcoin community hate mass adoption via regulation (less about Allaire's comments, more about historical sentiment), the currency is primarily used for illicit activities (they're not afraid of illegal shit, but illegal shit means they have to hire lawyers and people to stop potentially illegal shit), and actively tank App Store rankings as a result of a company removing a feature that r/Bitcoin spun into a primary use case.
@_date: 2016-12-07 04:53:17
Not Circle!
@_date: 2016-12-08 04:52:09
Nah, dawg. No one wants to hear that practical shit. 
Businesses don't use Bitcoin because of the risk and illicit activities, combined with the lack of history and non-illicit use cases. If you're an exchange, you need to have more fraud protections than most countries because: 
1. Kids who can't get judgments issued steal credit cards
2. People use it for drugs (compliance, since BTC is property/currency that was used to obtain illicit substances) 
3. 35-year-olds live boring lives and are horrible gamblers, 
4. Someone is using it for money laundering. 
Then there's also the question of what is the honest potential of Bitcoin: is it supposed to be for purchasing things, or just for speculation (like digital gold)?
Ex: If I accepted Bitcoin to run my "coffee" shop (is that r/bitcoin talk for drugs?), I'd still need to find someone else that accepted Bitcoin to buy more materials or anything else. Otherwise, I'm relying on exchanges to cash out, and getting hit with reporting taxes, volatility, and fees because it's Bitcoin and someone needs profit to offset volatility loss.  
With that said, there's some neat blockchain ideas that'll hopefully do something with the space.
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:44:36
Exactly. A Bitcoin savings account is just not needed.
Savings accounts give interest because banks invest with customers' money. With the volatility of Bitcoin, that would be unnecessary at best, and a costly expense for OP at its worst.
Also, why would one use credit with Bitcoin, a relatively anonymous currency on the internet? People could buy someone's identity online, apply for 6 figure credit lines, blow it on coke, and default. OP would have to pay that.
When the average person that you'd want using a Bitcoin credit card (someone who can pay off debts, and is who they say they are) has no issue applying for a normal credit card, and when Bitcoin is for near-instant settlement (compared to monthly settlement with credit), what's the benefit of using a Bitcoin credit card?

At worst, they look like an accessory to a crime. That's why PR is a career field full of people who can spin shitty things into less shitty things.

Dirty fiat has buyer protections, rewards, and things law abiding citizens like. Bitcoin does not. If this Nakamoto-forsaken community could make one thing that the average Joe can only do with Bitcoin that isn't illegal in the next 5 years, I'd be impressed.
Please, supplement this post with a list of businesses that incentivize BTC purchases and don't simultaneously make an environment conducive for money laundering (cheap gift cards pls), gambling (who authorizes 3 month's worth of BTC purchases?), and/or drug dealing (who doesn't luv smokin fake w33d).

You'll definitely want to start working on paperwork to be a licensed MSB as soon as possible, if you want to issue credit cards and savings accounts. Licenses are costly and time-consuming.
Additionally, if you get those licenses you'll need an efficient, lean risk and compliance team. The same entity that makes banks have to close DNMer's accounts, FinCEN, will either be your best friend, or drag your ass to jail for not reporting shit.

Holding keys really isn't. You find a wallet that lets you either generate a 12-word seed/backup, and you save it somewhere.

The average consumer has no need for Bitcoin at this point in time. You're looking for a solution to a problem that law-abiding people don't yet have.

It's related because Bitcoin would be an ideal alternative for merchants who don't like the way their business works with PayPal.

The community operates on a lot of principle, which is neat. What's not neat is that the community often ignores the negative (read: illicit/illegal) use cases for Bitcoin, as if the community were in a position where they could do that and grow they way it would like. 
I just don't see the community self-policing when conversations about tracing services (another side-effect of the community's inability to self-police with regards to illegal activities) dwell on hypothetical false positives, and the thread about Backpage's CEO getting arrested are less about profiting from human trafficking and more about whether he's legally responsible for human rights violations that occurred on his site.

Seriously, this. OP's first post on their (throwaway?) account is about how Coinbase has locked up a decent chunk of change, but hasn't provided any context. 
I'm not even going to ask the questions I'd ask if I were a Coinbase risk team member, but making a new reddit account and trying to rouse a mob by invoking the "centralized wallet froze my account" argument seems sketch. 
The only thing you can do at this point is truthfully answer whatever questions they ask to push the investigation along. A lot of people give posters the benefit of the doubt, as if people don't lie, and as if context weren't a motivating factor in all of these situations. 
If you weren't doing sketchy shit, you'll get your money back. If you were, you're part of the reason why Bitcoin is where it is (not that you'd care, clearly).

No need for thanks, as I haven't failed in accomplishing anything. 
It does seem as though you and yours might be failing in self-regulating, so you might want to continue posting Wiki links. Maybe you'll post it in a reply to the right person who'll champion the idea for you!

This. Everyone knows that closed accounts mean that you're etch-a-sketch. 
I don't get how people have this cognitive dissonance with governance; they'll go on and on about how the state is peering too much into their own business and holding them down while forgetting most of the means they're using to birch about the state were created by it. I'm not saying people don't have a right to criticize government (completely support that), just don't swing your story as some Big Brother shutdown

I mean, couldn't they just turn off referral bonuses for the DS lead or loop referral bonuses from him back into their treasury? 
I figure that their systems are coded in a way that referrals have to stem from someone, so the DS guy (the person whose job it is to analyze referral data) made it his account; maybe it was for easy tracking, maybe it wasn't. Only Coinbase can tell us what's going on.

1. How do you decentralize time? I don't see where you came to the conclusion that the Ethereum and Circle communities want to do that.
2. Where does advocating decentralized time become advocating for basic income? 
3. It sounds like you don't like a redistribution of wealth, or the idea that people who bought Bitcoin years ago are technically super-rich. That's how currencies with inflation work; you're more than welcome to sell me your Bitcoin at pre-2010 prices if you're against your investments increasing in value.
I'm also not seeing where 1 and 2 lead to inflation, nor am I seeing where you gathered these sentiments. We're there surveys I missed?
@_date: 2016-07-21 04:49:12
It's actually really, really logical. Fintech companies that deal with the illicit activity associated with cryptocurrencies need to cover their asses in case OP/ person that bought BTC from OP's dumbass gets arrested and says "Coinbase let me"
I can see that you hold personal principle in a higher regard than the law; that's cool and all, but that won't keep businesses or people out of litigation for blatant violations of AML/KYC regulations
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:55:00
Interesting; I can only assume Uber did that for easy on-boarding. Do you have an article that describes what went on?
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:55:51
They don't *need* warnings, and you're right; no one on r/btc gives a shit what you do with your money.
If the ones that are compliant with regulations should have warnings, shouldn't less centralized ones like the ones you listed and Abra (that seem to put the burden of AML/KYC onto the individual tellers) have one too?
 But there are laws for a reason; AML regulations stop people who gain cash from illegal activities (drugs, arms sales, theft, fraud, human trafficking) from tuening that into capital that's untrackable. KYC regulations make sure that companies don't fund or aid terrorism or organized crime. 
Idrc about your stances on any of those illicit activities, but it's idiotic when people like you use the internet (that was developed by the US government) to complain about governments' practical laws for preventing terrorism and human/drug trafficking based on idealistic principles. 
If you think anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding measures are a slippery slope, then run for government so that you can be a voice for the Bitcoin community. If you have some magic principle that prevents you from turning your idealism into political action, then I'm sure a country with looser regularions would be glad to have you.

Jeez, there's gotta be a way to stamp out ponzi schemes like OneCoin and Coince...

Politics is BS because people let it devolve into a series of bribes and fundraising interests. 
So why don't you, O Enlightened r/BTCer, remove the smoke and mirrors?
Bitcoin is not going to bring direct democracy, especially when mainstream adoption is discouraged by governments (too many gamblers and illicit purchases) and the community (idealistic people that believe a currency will make politicians obsolete when *regular, law-abiding citizens don't have a use for Bitcoin.*
You do realize that driving the price of Bitcoin up with speculative purchases (when terrorists, gamblers, fraudsters, drug dealers, organized mobsters, etc. support a large chunk of its day-to-day transactions) is also fueling those interests, right?

If you used your bank account to buy the BTC, it's the banks's fault. ACH takes half a work week to clear, and at the last working day the business can find out that your account was closed (so naturally, they wouldn't front you the funds before they got it).
As for the exchange rate, idk dawg

Original post, not sure why removed:






Until there is a cryptocurrency that deals with the relationship of free time, separation of rich and poor, and provides a moving difficulty model that influences how that wealth (aka time) is redistributed... then the righteous platitudes of the Etherium and Circle communities should be seen simply as cronyism by other means.
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:34:44
I see that you're quite the fan of BitSquare. 
Does that service, or any of the other ones you shill for, have warnings stating that **selling BTC with unlicensed MSBs/buying drugs and steroids are illegal,** and the P2P nature of those services means that the customer assumes all AML/KYC risk?
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:26:21


It looks like Abra facilitated the exchange between the US -&gt; MX Abra tellers, and since Abra accounts have passwords, they'd fall under this umbrella. Abra's business model seems to shuck the danger onto the individual (like Uber) but doesn't provide a means of facilitating even partial compliance procedure for individual "tellers". 
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:29:04
I'd suggest against committing fraud. Fraud is illegal, and as much as the BTC community pretends otherwise, laws are still a thing.

If you're not sure, ask Coinbase and Circle for their MCC code, and ask Simple if they're cool with receiving funds from their respective MCC codes. 
It's a hassle, but it's better than having issues and funds frozen, you know?

Now you've lost me. Between calling Google the CIA and this post about scaremongering, I'm not sure where you're going.
You state that Bitcoin will be a true democracy, where people will vote with their dollars.
Concurrently, if the majority of use cases with Bitcoin are related to illicit activities (online gambling, tumblers, drugs, etc) then people are *voting with their actions* (y'know, democratically) that Bitcoin's use lies in illicit activites.
Companies like Coinbase and Circle want regular people to reap the benefits of Bitcoin. But when their bank closes their account for purchasing a currency historically associated with illegal things, then regular people don't find out about Bitcoin until someone scams them for concert tickets or cheap shoes.

To answer and their accusation that I'm attacking them on two different threads in which they threatened chargebacks in order to cancel a service/get money back, I'm examining the situation and making observations.

@_date: 2016-07-06 13:37:32
Nah, I seem to have misread your comment. I interpreted it as if people were signing up for BB using Uber emails, and Uber encouraged that so that there was a synergistic relationship. It seems that that was far from the case haha

Does Google warn you when searching that the NSA or FBI could come knocking on your door for searching "how to launder money/buy cocaine with bitcoin/ make a pipe IED?" 
That's the same logic; no need to scare the average person woth common-sense "don't use us to break the law" warnings if they're not going to use the service for illegal things. Then again, Google has the mainstream adoption that Bitcoin needs. YMMV

Aaaaaaaand there it is; the tinfoil hat slipped out, caught a ray of sunlight, and has been revealed. 
While Google may cooperate with the CIA in order to stop crime, they aren't one and the same.
