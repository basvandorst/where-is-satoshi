Is that what the other guy implied? that he'd steal resources? Have you got autism?

It's what happens when a new project has a lot of traffic.

Can you explain why you called the distribution opaque? 
The software has been experiencing bugs because of the unusually high volume of traffic they've been experiencing. Most of the launch issues were the fault of the Amazon Web Services who host their servers. At the moment they're fixing everyone's issues fast before they move on with marketing.
The simulated mining app is not the only USP. It's also the fact that app is fully integrated with the ability to buy/sell/trade/mine Electroneum. The ease of use and simplicity of it is a major catalyst for mass adoption. If you don't believe that, try introducing some people who aren't versed in technology to buying/selling/trading/mining any cryptocurrency - most of the time they will give up or not understand. Everyone understands how to install an app and press a button to begin the mining process. 
Most people have smartphones, but not PC's able to mine, even in 3rd world countries, where the fiat currency is overinflated and useless, or where billions are unbanked, you'll find at least one person in every village with a smartphone and internet connection. 
You say it's vaporware and that it doesn't and won't exist, however Richard Ells the CEO has already shown the app working, and they've mentioned it is planned to be online on January 2nd. Why are you spreading misinformation when you have not got a good understanding of the coin?

Spreading misinformation anywhere is spreading misinformation, doesn't matter where that is. I didn't say you had to 'debate' me, I was simply explaining my reasons for why you were wrong in assuming most of the things you did. 
I'm not being over-defensive at all, I stated facts because I wanted to inform you on why your comment was dismissive misinformation. I'm letting you know about the coin's "sound fundamentals", because of that misinformation, not because I don't have faith - if I didn't have faith why would I be explaining it to you?
I don't suspect McAffee was paid by Electroneum at all, they recently had to ask Harry Redknapp to remove his endorsement of the coin because people like you assumed that was paid for too.
Yes, it sounds incredibly ignorant actually. People who dismiss altcoins with the word "shitcoin" without doing their thorough research are the one's who will miss out in the long run. You can;t possibly tell if it's a "shitcoin" because you can't see into the future. I'm not saying Electroneum will be the one to make you miss out, but you will miss out if you treat most altcoins like that.

I saw a Bentley with "BTC" as its number plate not too long ago. In a small town in the middle of nowhere.
