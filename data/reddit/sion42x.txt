The 'browsing' VM and wallet VM would be separate. The browsing VM would only let traffic out (none in) and the wallet VM would only allow blockchain updates (thanks for mentioning that) and maybe SSH (but ONLY on the internal VM network, not public network) for VNC over SSH to use it.
I can definitely see the wisdom of what you're advocating though. I think it would be possible to secure the wallet VM from any intrusion, but having it on a piece of hardware locked away somewhere would of course be a safer bet. But not nearly as convenient.

Thanks very much, I can't wait until he sees his first sale! Glad you like the bracelet too, he has this loom that he uses to make them but they're still pretty tough. He spends many evenings watching YouTube videos on how to make better ones.
You should be able to select Republic of Ireland now on the checkout, and it has a flat rate of $9.45. Hopefully that works until I can find a better international method! Thanks so much again, you're really making him feel like a straight up businessman.

He does, though he hasn't done anything with it yet. He's aware of Litecoin and has 'plans' to diversity into it at some point. ;)
His address is: LfzVVwURs6fZ4Bp3C69qLoGJvCgLJ7SCmQ
It would be fun to play with some exchanging with him. Do you have any recommendation for an exchange that shows all the different coin types (other than BTC-E)?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:36:48
No, no file. Remember that bitcoin isn't like cash; you don't hold it in your hand. In the end it comes down to two things: a public key and a private key. The public key is an address and the private key is the access code to that address. People can transfer bitcoin to your address (the public key) and you have the right to do things with that bitcoin so long as you have the corresponding private key. 
So at a localbitcoin thing, you'd show your public key and someone would transfer coin to it. Once the transfer is verified (meaning machines running the bitcoin software have seen the transaction from his address to yours take place) you can hand him cash. And the deal is done. 
In the end, the whole of bitcoin comes down to line items on the great ledger we call the block chain. Public addresses form the "debit from" and "credit to" components of the ledger, and private keys enable you to claim a public address and utilize its funds.

I recently made a post about my 9 year old and his growing interest in Bitcoin. The ever-awesome community here responded in a huge way, offering words of support and in some cases some financial incentive to him (absolutely amazing by the way). 
Original Thread: 
He’s been going crazy about Bitcoin since then, talking non-stop about it. The first thing he tells me in the morning isn’t ‘hi’ but the current value of bitcoin. Thus far he’s gone into great detail on Bitcoin to: 2 neighborhood friends, his grandma, multiple classmates at school, his math teacher (no presentation yet), me, my wife, his sister, and one of our neighbors who is a hedge fund manager. Yeah, he’s got the bug.
He also asked (begged) me to set up an online site where he can sell his rubber band bracelets for Bitcoin. I took a suggestion from the above thread and used Wordpress with Woocommerce and the Bitcoin plugin and got one running fairly quickly. He’s only got a few inventory items but is working hard to make more so he can start making more Bitcoin. Shortly after getting it running, he got his first sale from a fellow The cool part is that the buyer lives in Ireland (we’re in NJ, US). The transaction went incredibly smoothly and in just a couple clicks he made his first sale overseas! We shipped the bracelet off today.
I can’t help but think how cool it is that a 9 year old was able to create something and sell it to someone in a different continent. What’s even better is that the financial part of the transaction was BY FAR the easiest part. Bitcoin really is the currency the Internet needs and deserves right now.
By the way…yes, me putting his site here is something of a plug. I can promise you that his bracelets are pretty dang cool and that there’s more coming. If you’re interested in buying one but your country isn’t listed let me know and I’ll see how shipping works. And please only click the Pay with Bitcoin button if you plan on buying or else it holds up the inventory for nothing!
Thanks again Reddit, you turned my little financial hobbyist into a full fledged entrepreneur.

Aww shucks. ;) I did caution him against day trading though. He wanted to know if he could sell some and buy more when it goes lower. I explained how it works but told him that until you really know what you're doing, it's more like gambling than trading and that he should keep practicing "buy and hold" first.

No, not that way. It's a one way hash. Being able to crack that would be an end to network security as we know it, not just a way to steal bitcoin. At this time it is computationally impossible.

I think they need their own subreddit at this point.
To the OP though, I'm a pretty new user and have been using Coinbase without issues. That said, if you're having problems with them remember that they're a funded Silicon Valley startup and not an open-source effort or public service. Challenge them by getting support from them, and if they can't resolve your issue then don't give them your business.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:07:12
So I have to tell you a followup to this because it was funny. While my son is all about saving and investing, my daughter (11) is all about spending. She's $30 in debt to me and her mom and thinks it sucks that her brother is getting "free money" every time Bitcoin goes up (though she acknowledges that she doesn't want to put money into it because she'd rather spend it). Typical preteen. ;)
So I called my wife to tell her that someone had sent .05BTC to our son (she still doesn't 'get it' but she understands it's money at least). She said we should tell him and keep it a secret from our daughter so she doesn't go on a rant about how she wants money too. My son heard her say "keep it a secret" over the phone and ran over to her and said "Keep what a secret?? Did my bitcoin crash??!"

Some of the things he's come up with so far (his words, my spelling):
* Bitcoins are created by really powerful computers solving insane math problems. That's called mining. The problems get harder and harder when more bitcoins get mined.
* If a person tried to mine Bitcoins without a computer it would take 2 zillion years (he got that from the other post I mentioned)
* Bitcoins are digital money. It's kind of like money in online games except you can buy real things with it.
* My paper wallet (I'm going to give him a blank one) isn't just a wallet, it's like my own bank. People can use this side to give me money. Inside the secret area is my key that lets me use the money. No one's allowed to ever see it but me or else it's like they broke into my bank.
* There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever made! And I own .32164308 of them. (he might have to write it down, but who knows...he remembers all the IPs in the house for me)
Safe so far?

We figured we'd be down in the basement making bracelets while he fanned himself with stacks of paper wallets.
In the end he definitely couldn't keep up with demand but he gave it the old elementary school try. A friend in the neighborhood and his penpal both chipped in with bracelets, for which he paid $1/ea.
He's actually gotten a taste of being successful and how other people react too (kind of interesting). His cousin said he could draw pictures if Andrew gave him half. Another friend said that he needs to be part of the business and get some because they're friends. And another friend said she wanted to send him bracelets to sell and get some money out of it (that one he took up because he needed inventory). He's gotten to learn about how to make decent business decisions under (peer) pressure which is good.
Thanks for buying, I remember sending it to you specifically!

Just an FYI, we did just put up a 4 pack of singles and a new starburst if you wanted one. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:05:56
So I told him about you wanting to buy a bracelet last night. He rushed up to his room faster than a cat photo to the front page and made a black, white, and blue starburst for you. Then he started going on about how he wants to open an online store that accepts Bitcoin and maybe he can spend weekends making bracelets since he's busy with homework during the week and on and on and on. ;) I think you excited him.
That being said, I spent the morning making a little storefront for him, with one item in stock specifically for you. If the price seems fair, give it a shot! 
Also forgive me, but I'm having trouble figuring out why messages from it are going to spam. Check for bitcoinbracelets in your spam box if you order and don't see anything come in!
Thank you again for this (whether you decide to buy the bracelet or not). You and others here really made his week and woken up an entrepreneurial hunger in him!

I think the bitcointip flip/roll concept is pretty cool as it is intriguing as hell to people who aren't bitcoiners. Usually the next reply is "what in the hell just happened?" to be followed by enlightenment and interest.
Giving $1 via the phone could have the same effect though to a limited audience. In fact, if I were a business giving something away for free I could definitely see doing a promotion where I give you $1 in bitcoin and have you give it back to "buy" the item. Promotion + awareness.
In fact I think I saw a site recently that did something like this...you sign up and get a wallet with money in it then run through a demo where you give bitcoin to charity. Can't remember where though.

Thank you, I transferred it over to his wallet. =) He's really excited about it...partly from the increases in value over USD, but also because he feels like he's totally in control of it.

Thanks again for the idea! As for how he plans to explain it, he said he plans to tell them about how "Bitcoin is created by powerful computers that solve complex math problems that would take 2 zillion years to do by hand (he got that from the post I mentioned).

Hahahaha! Absolutely. But she'd try to sell it for him for ALL of his money, complain when he says no, and then settle for whatever he tells her and go shopping. In the end that .05 BTC would become some new earrings, a pack of gum, and some summer flip flops.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:39:59
Oh, and by the way...I definitely did detract him from day trading. He told me that he had an idea...that he could sell bitcoin when it goes up and buy it again when it goes down (Yes, my son invented day trading) ;). I told him it was a great idea BUT costly and a gamble even with the right knowledge, and told him sticking to buy and hold is a much better choice right now. He agreed.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:19:25
His sister does that for him. She brags that she's the spender that keeps the economy flowing to make him rich. ;)
It was actually pretty funny a few days ago when the price was around $900 we told him that he still had $100 he'd put in a bank savings account years ago that was going to start taking $7 a month unless the balance went over $500 (PNC). We asked if he wanted to move it to Bitcoin. He got real solemn and said "pull the trigger."

There's a few ways to get bitcoin. Three that come to mind are:
Mining: back in the day this was feasible for the average Joe but today it requires tremendous computing power and specialized equipment that still may never pay off.
Trade/Purchase: You can buy from a broker like coinbase.com or trade for it on an exchange like Mt.Gox, bitstamp, campBX, etc. 
Steal: while the chances of you randomly generating someone else's private/public key combination are so insignificant it could be called impossible, it is possible to steal accounts by hacking online wallets or into people's computers, finding wallet backups stored insecurely, guessing or brute forcing "brain wallet" codes, etc. Or digging up old hard drives in Welsh landfills.

It is theoretically possible for you to generate a wallet with the same private key as someone else. However, the chances are 1 in 2^256 (115 quattuorvigintillion or 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936). For comparison, the age of the universe in seconds is 430000000000000000. (thanks Wolfram Alpha)

Maybe I'm being overcautious, but the school and parents where I live are overprotective to the point of viciousness. They have several rules against kids selling things in school. If they decide that my son is conning them out of money it would be very bad. This is the kind of place where cops bust kids for operating lemonade stands without a license. ;)
I'm trying to figure out a way for it to work for him! In fact, it looks like we may be able to sell a few of his bracelets online for BTC which he's crazy excited about.

Yes though you can back up your wallet or use an online wallet like coinbase. Back in 2010 I bought some bitcoin, couldn't think of a good way to use it, and deleted the software and wallet like you might uninstall a game you accidentally wasted money on. Kicking myself for it now.

Not really sure what you're looking for here. Though I think an illustrated globe tilted at 23° with a Bitcoin symbol over the earth (maybe an arrow pointing up at the top of the vertical bar) and a flag coming out of the South Pole with a Sean's Outpost QR on it would be cool. But I'm not much of a designer to try it and see if it's any good.

@_date: 2013-11-08 12:15:12
I'm not even going to begin to try this, but check my logic here (I know nothing about cryptography and forgot math for the most part):
With only uppercase English characters we have 26 possible choices, choose 3 (*_26_*C*_3_*) for a total of 2600 combinations. So if you could do it in 1 attempt per second it would be 43 minutes to completion. Add lowercase and there's 22,100 combinations. Add numbers and there's 37,820. So that's about 10.5 hours at 1 attempt per second. 
But BIP38 is unicode capable right? Is that all 109,449 characters from Unicode 6.0? If so that's *_109449_*C*_3_* or 218,510,464,002,324 combinations. At 1 attempt per second that's about 6,928 millennia to figure out at max. 
Whether it's just US ASCII characters or something else, I'd probably try to create two Python scripts: one to find all possible combinations and another to check them against the hash. Then use an Amazon Elastic MapReduce job w/ Hadoop streaming to run the scripts as map only phases for speed.
Note again that my numbers could be all wrong and I'm a total idiot. Just trying to rationalize why I'm not attempting this. BIP38 seems neat. 
EDIT: I guess subscript doesn't work on this sub.

@_date: 2013-12-05 02:21:53
A few things: if you transfer from coinbase to a paper wallet you can't just get a little out at a time. You'll have to import the entire paper wallet to a tool like Armory or blockchain.info, thus making the paper wallet irrelevant. Paper wallets aren't the only non-hosted solution. You could use something like multibit (local client), encrypt it, and take backups for safety. Multibit will allow you to send bitcoin anywhere and buy things. 
As far as Gox is concerned, it's very difficult to get your cash out of Gox. Yes, the sell is higher but be prepared to wait weeks or more for the cash. Coinbase is fairly high and quick.

If it's just a couple products and you're in the US you can use the buy buttons under Tools on coinbase. Otherwise bitpay is good or just a picture of your public receiving QR code though that requires a LOT of record keeping and manual labor. Anything else would probably take a little scripting (like if you want a different wallet per transaction). 
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:30:30
I don't know if I'd recommend that. If you buy it preloaded you never know what might be on there that could screw you over later.

I thought about doing that, but I think it would have to be giveaways and not selling. While I'd love to let him sell like he wants to, the other parents of 9 year olds might not be so keen on the idea since *in their eyes* he's selling pieces of paper for real money (and the buyers would have no real clue on how to secure or use them). I'm still trying to come up with a way for him to 'do business' with Bitcoin, since I think it would be a great next step for him to try. At the very least I'll give him the option to get allowance in Bitcoin.

Fairly certain it synchronizes with transactions related to your wallets only from the dates those transactions occurred. This also means you sometimes have to resynchronize the blockchain as of a certain date to catch "missed" transactions.

It depends on how you want to keep your coins. You can use something like coinbase to set up an online wallet with a brokerage where you can buy, sell, and hold. BUT if it gets hacked or they decide to do so you then you can lose everything. If you go this route use two factor authentication. 
You can use blockchain.info to set up an online wallet that YOU control with two factor authentication as well. 
You can use multibit or armory or electrum to set up a wallet on your computer. This will use PC, Mac, or Linux software to create as many addresses as you want. If you go this route, make sure you encrypt and set a good password. 
Lastly, you can use a paper wallet which is known as cold storage. With that you would download an HTML page that can generate them like  . It generates a public and private key and prints it in a way you can hide the key and store it forever. The public key can be deposited to and the private is hidden until you're ready to use it. When you want to redeem it you would import the wallet into armory or blockchain.info and do what you want with the coin. 
Hope this helps!

I wonder what the psychological name is for what I'm dealing with. This move to mBTC makes sense but for some reason is really freaking me out.

Which is stupid because nothing has actually changed. Scumbag brain.
