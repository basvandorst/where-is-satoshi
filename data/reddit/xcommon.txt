Hardware wallets in a home safe and the recovery phrases in a safe deposit box?

I don't think it was as nefarious as most people are making it out to be. They're not evil, they're greedy. They thought that there would be some instability they could profit from, after which they could apologize for poor execution and move along.
With how absurdly fucked up this has actually been, I don't think they get to play the "oopsie!" card now. I don't think they even know how to get in front of this, while minimizing the damage they've already done. This is evident through their lack of public statement. 
I'm honestly considering using kraken as my main now, which is should be incredibly embarrassing for coinbase.

yup, while also disabling the 'sell' feature. I honestly don't see how they could defend this publicly.

Some people are over dramatizing this situation. Most of us are just extremely disappointed in what was previously a very reliable exchange, that at least gave the appearance of having their user's best interest at heart. 
We'll be taking our business elsewhere now.

I get what you're saying, but I do my transactions in bursts and keep my crypto elsewhere. So far, coinbase has been my go-to because I'm already verified through them and they play well with my bank. 
For transactions going forward, I'm planning to get verified to higher tiers on kraken, and use them now. 
I said "considering" previously because I don't actually have to make a decision until I decision until I make some trades again, which probably won't be until next month.
And if I decide not to use kraken, as they have their own host of issues, that doesn't mean I'll go back to coinbase.

not yet, but it's pretty much there

not really, he's saying the rate cut is indicating we may be about to go through a recession, not that it's causing it.
and I'm not saying he's right

the blutooth function doesn't concern you?
