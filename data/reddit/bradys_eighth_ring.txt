Today bitcoin wants a piece of the world economy's fiat marketcap. Tomorrow the world's fiat economy will want a piece of the bitcoin new world order's marketcap

Good luck getting the timing right. Sure, it can and does work. But you're banking on being able to pickup a crash/dip AND its turn around early enough to profit and without jumping the gun on your everyday fluctuations.  Then add in the fact you're up against AIs built specifically for this purpose...  
It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it works out for him.

I can't tell if you are being obtuse on purpose.
What makes Bitcoin the "perfect money" as you say?
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:48:33
So in your eyes BTC is perfect as it is?
What do you use BTC for?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:11:48
How much do those cost?

Context: I am positing the same question to all of my favorite coins subs. I hope to not only come across new information about the coins, but also gain new insights into the communities which support them.
Being able to openly discuss the biggest obstacles, as well as the blueprints for overcoming those obstacles, is an essential part of success for any endeavor.
Thank you for your feedback!

Agreed. Do you think LN is the answer to this problem?  
Do you know of any other solutions being worked on? (Not including raising block size, as I am well aware of the coins taking that route)
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:49:32
Nobody mentioned alt coins except you.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:20:50
Thank you for your objective response. 
Do you feel this applies to crypto as a whole? 
Do you feel that perhaps (some of) these issues might paint a brighter future for stable coins?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:08:52
And the plan for this is lightning network?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:11:27
Thank you for your response.  If I am not mistaken, these are issues that plague the entire crypto-community as well, yes?

While I do agree with your points in relation to the value of bitcoin, it most assuredly does have a high energy cost.  Crypto uses the same amount of energy as the country of Israel ([ Whether that is excessive or not is a matter of opinion I suppose.
Might I ask, How long do you think before LN has solved the scalability issue?
Also, what does Segwit actually do?
Thanks for your input

What do you mean "it doesn't matter since it's a bitcoin sub"?  
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, discussing pain points for crypto-currencies is precisely what matters.  
Being able to identify which pain points are unique to bitcoin, and which ones affect the crypto-community as a whole is essential to securing a successful future for bitcoin.

Could you elaborate on this please? I'm not sure I follow
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:58:17
Lol. Thanks, I now understand Bitcoin and the universe itself
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:23:14
Lmao. DENIED
