It has 15k.
But this is the internet, so why admit you are wrong? just move the goalposts. I am sure if not for how right you are it would have WAAAY more. You're a smart guy.

So, not sure I should admit this... I watched his video on how to "read" a book. It mostly involves reading the table of contents and then guessing what it probably says.

What do Texans with Chains have to do with this?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:35:51
So we all upvoted everyone who said that it didn't matter when they removed it. We all still agree that this does not matter and there is nothing good for bitcoin about having this, right?

I was a new investor back when Bitcoin was at 7k (what was that, like 3 weeks ago?)
One of the first things I learned. Nobody knows. It feels like you can know what the chart is going to tend to do, but the damn thing could skyrocket at any moment and it could, just as easily, decide to stop skyrocketing and crash, and nobody here on Reddit will have known it was going to.
Conventional advice however, is that eventually, in like 20-50 years, BTC is going to be incredibly valuable, and that if you wait months not days, the price is going to trend upwards, and do so a lot more radically than your favorite mutual fund.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:46:17
I recommend Coinbase, but I've never tried Bittrex.
As to getting in late, one thing that gives me solace when i think about first hearing about BTC and not buying, is knowing that almost all of the people who DID by then, have bought and sold a couple times already now. The first adopters are not the most financially savvy people in the works, they are geeky kids, and they might have stood to make tons, but many of them swung it all into ETH before it crashed, or sold out at the bottom of a valley when they were scared one day and had to buy in again at a higher value. If they learned their lesson, and you learned their lesson, then you are both ready now to make some money.

Well, no, actually. The temple grounds, the court of the gentiles and the court of women were places of "worship" in the sense of nearness to god, but they were not the location of worship services like we have with modern synagogues. They were places for meeting and greeting, milling about ant connecting to one another. The actual sacrifices and stuff were done farther within the temple in the court of men, and the songs were song on virtually the entire mountain.

"violent" against a table. yeah

no churches back then. they were inside the temple court

Sorry you have to be at the end of the chain. Way to take one for the team.

Just buy. In ten years you will look back on the change to buy at 12k and it will look cheap. Don't wait for the drop, which may not happen for years, to get your skin in the game. If you are going to hodl it's not going to matter that much
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:35
yeah they were also filling up the court of the gentiles in order to do more special transactions for Jews only. There were lots of things about that behavior that were not cool.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:13:22
As a pastors son you may recall having heard him explain that the church is not a building. God's "house" as a metaphor used to be used for the temple. now it is used for the Christians. The people.
And for the record, you can do trade near Christians.
It's not okay to be a userer, or to do raceism, like for instance by filling the court of the gentiles with paraphanalia to "benifit" the jewish worshippers that it inviladites it fro people of other nations.

Didn't know who you were to me for a sec, Your last ten posts are all self important tirades against different things you don't understand.
I'm not on the side of the issue you think I am on. I was being cheeky. You didn't get it. I tried to save you the embarrassment. Someone else noticed and apparently downvoted you.
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:20:50
[Really]( 
I feel like there is a whole lot of argument out there that they are used primarily for collecting, hunting, personal protection and intimidation, target shooting, etc. If you think it is universally accepted that guns are for killing humans, then the fact that there is even a controversy over whether guns are good or bad is much more disturbing.
But regardless, the argument out there is that the only way to stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun. So I think it would be very fair to say that every time a massage is stopped by a gunman that counts against the number of massacres caused by gunmen. Right?
If that's the case, that guns solve more problems than they cause, then it's hardly unfair to have gun companies put their money where their mouth is. Is it?
The only way it would be unfair is if innocent lives were regularly being taken as a result of gun manufacturer's actions.

copper oxidises, yeah. But generally you don't want live circuits exposed to oxygen anyway for other reasons. You cover them in rubber.

I mean guns save lives don't they? This seems like it would work out in the gun company's favor unless that's bullshit and guns are actually bad.

@_date: 2019-11-11 05:49:25
If the 50 year old thinks they can personally smelt gold and make jewelry out of it themself, and that that would be good somehow.. they are boomer enough for me. That is a great fucking boomer impression right there. Nails the arrogance, the ignorance, and the total lack of touch with the modern world perfectly. All it's missing is racism.
@_date: 2019-11-11 05:39:56
Let's imagine all electricity stops working forever. Electrons decide to all settle down and just retire they don't move anymore. Somehow the electrical signals in our brain keep firing tho. We have no idea why, our models of science have all broken down. The world is a terrifying desolate place. Why the fuck will I want your shiny metal? 
What will I do with it? Why would I ever give you something useful like food or water or horses or guns or women or even particularly nice straight sticks in exchange for your collection of gold?
The only use for gold is to trade it for something else. The only way anyone would want it is if it could be relied upon as a means of exchange because other people wanted it.
You have invented this impossible scenario in your head to try to make Bitcoin useless and Gold not, and even if I give you the magic wand to make any kind of world you want you have failed. When society breaks down, the gold standard breaks down with it. And all the fiat currency standards. And Bitcoin. If you think that's likley (it's not) invest in something with real utility. Books maybe. If you think we can continue to rely on the market without catastrophic changes to atomic physics (we can) then you have no argument against crypto.

It's not the time they were born. It's the attitude they have and the perspective they lack. You can be born any old time and act like a boomer. You can be born right in the middle of the baby boom and not have the attitude that is being dismissed.
What is new, the only thing that is new, is Gen Y and Z have learned that there is no reasoning with a boomer. The best thing to do is to roll your eyes and move on.
That's why if you say something intelligent or insightful to this comment, I'll keep talking to you. But if you act like a boomer and just dig your heels in, refusing to accept new information, and just rephrase what you said before, I'm going to respond with "ok boomer"
@_date: 2019-03-22 06:38:21
Yep, I'll PM you. I use coinbase, although it is not super popular around here among the big fancy pants crypto fans.
@_date: 2019-11-11 05:43:21
Yes but only for silly reasons. Copper is a better conductor but gold looks cool and some people think it is better since it is expensive so you can charge more.
@_date: 2019-11-12 05:00:33


So the only thing I could possibly mean is something you object to as not being sensible? You are not open to the possibility that maybe I don't mean the same thing by the word that you do? You are not willing to acquire new information even at your own detriment?
Ok Boomer

I think we should start using "Deadsoon" as in "Oh you are offended by the official title you gave your own generation, well we will pick a more descriptive one to the reason we are dismissing you then. Ok Deadsoon"

If somebody manages to simultaneously do everything that is objectionable about Draco Malfoy in a single sentance, Don't you think it would be normal to say "He's acting like Draco Manloy" instead of "he is simultaneously acting entitled, saying he is going to cry to mamma, being spoiled because he is rich, acting nasty for no reason, demonstrating racial prejudice, and wearing a green robe with a snake on it"
Like... I didn't invent using words for groups of things that are described by other words. That's called "language"
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:47:49
I'd describe Y and Z as digital natives. People who have spent their whole lives using digital technology and who feel comfortable with it. I would also say that a key identifying aspect of their identity for many "ok boomer" conversations is that they expect to live for more than a few more decades. Say 30 years or more.
The typical boomer attitude does not expect to remain alive for long, nor does it much care what happens after that. They want their social security payouts, their medicare, their cheap gas and inhabitable planet. But they do not want anyone else to have a stable social security system, subsidized medicine or public option insurance, renewable fuel sources or a stable climate.
So age does factor in, but less about birth and more about death. Also, if an older person cares about the next generation (like your average Greatest Generation, or Silent Generation folks do) their expected expiry date ceases to become such a problem.

yeah buy anything I want to buy would still have taken a lot more dollars in 1919. Like, how much a month for unlimited talkie movies delivered to my home? I got that for free with my "Every album ever" club subscription for $10 a month. I have a feeling that 1919 would ask for more than $140.
And it's not just new stuff. I can get almost any book for $0.99c they'd be worth more than $14 back then I bet. A loaf of bread might have been $0.07c but I am on a low carb diet. And I don't heat my home with coal anymore.
All I'm saying is we got it pretty good overall.

Do you think cops in the US are like... the way they are on sesame street?
Like there is a Bear with a blue hat somewhere and he is just in charge of all the "laws" in town?

Oh so you can buy BTC for USD on GDAX at lower fees? I might want to do both, let a limit in case that 5k number ever shows up you know?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:06:15
If I have $10,000 in the band, I would like to be able to buy two coins at 5k each, as opposed to 1 and a fifth at 8k. Because then when BTC goes to a million, I will have 2 million instead of 1.2 million.
Ya know?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:09:36
I am confused. I buy on coinbase and when you decide to buy they lock in the price so that ti doesn't matter when it confirms. is GDAX different?

Tell me more about how to get more bitcoin from the profits I gain by my bitcoin increasing in value...
the only way I can think of to do that would be to trade it for other crypto and back, and i thought that was daytrading and not a good plan?
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:57:07
You are on reddit, where content that gets upvoted gets seen more/faster. People who invest in bitcoin want bitcoin to go up. The more people think it is likley to go up, the more it actually will go up. The more plausible sounding things saying it will go up are heard/consumed, the more people will think it is likley to go up.
Therefore, bitcoin owners often upvote bullish commentary
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:34:36
For cash, yes. Amazon giftcards are reasonable

That hurts man.
Like, I have the normal regrets of not getting in earlier/when I first heard about it, but I am actually GLAD I am in my position feeling sorry for being stupid instead of being smart and knowing I owned an asset that was worth a million dollars this time a year ago and I can't get it.
That shit is YOURS!
