Exactly. Typically prices rise during a prohibition. I think cryto is just too young still.

Originally? Pretty sure transactions were never this fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:10:28
Name recognition plays a huge factor. Bitcoin is established. What’s stopping someone from making a Walmart competitor? Nothing but it doesn’t mean people will shop there. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:26:40
Same applies to my gold. Rather just hold on to that. I’ll have to read up more on the topic. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:19:00
You forgot this coin.

I hope so. Would love to stock up on some cheap coins.

I don't understand. Why would the "radically different" bitcoin be called Legacy? Shouldn't it be the other way around? I purpose that Rodger can keep the Bitcoin name and we rename the real Bitcoin to Bitcoin 2.0 with all the improvements that Lightning Network has to offer. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:08:05
Well I never lost a single bitcoin so take that. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:13:35
Right like a Swiss bank account. Or Cayman Islands. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:46:01
Sounds exactly like my story. Although I found I’m really good at timing when to enter the market I’m terrible at exiting. I made a small mistake that turned into a big mistake and ended up losing 10% after a winning streak. And I found out I get really annoyed when the market over reacts to news. I’m a better person when I’m not trading. 
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:31:16
That will benefit egotistical middle management more than good hard working humble employees. There is a reason we have unions.

I'm confused. Bitcoin Core isn't a cryptocurrency. That tweet makes no sense.

I think it’s hilarious that people like this guy post crap like this without checking what sub it is.

It will be a step to creating more equal wages for the same job. If compensation is hidden we will never get there.

@_date: 2019-07-29 03:24:17
Do you believe that two people performing the same job at the same company should be paid drastically different wages?
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:10:29
Yes and I personally think they should stick to only loans. Needing to pay for them to store my money is outrageous especially since they turn around and make 10x off of it.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:36:41
I think all wages should be public.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:50:44
I think it’s hilarious that people like this guy post crap like this without checking what sub it is.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:49:45
Right. I was going to make a comment. TIL Bulgaria has gold. Or maybe it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:57:26
Does it apply since bitcoin is theoretically infinitely divisible?
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:17:59
Okay that makes sense now. I was so confused.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:17:45
Dot com companies are worth way more today than in the height of the bubble. I guess I’m okay with the comparison.

The only way this would be better is if it was a seamless loop.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:17:20
Everything you said is almost entirely correct. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 00:13:53
Not sarcastic. I don't disagree with the start of the problems . But I think the issue is deeper than just nationalizing oil and gas. This really seems like a repeat of what happened in Iran. Even though nationalizing oil and gas was the start we now know that the UK and US were behind the destabilization of the country.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same with Venezuela. Time will tell. Regardless the concept of socialization isn't the issue. The truth is we don't have an example of true socialization because it always seems to just be an excuse for dictatorship. And the opposite doesn't work either: pure capitalism leads to monopoly. There is a balance between socialism and capitalism that allows democracy to flourish. Certain things are better socialized: roads and military for example. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 04:55:24
Right. Which is why the US idea of imposing democracy and capitalism on other countries doesn’t work. They need to figure it out themselves the slow way. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:14:13
Actually it probably isn’t. There is no real evidence to support that claim. It is more likely to reference the Pillars of Hercules. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:11:40
And roads, and military. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:08:59
I'm saying probably. We won't know how for many years. Just like we didn't know about what the CIA did is Iran, or in Grenada etc. It takes time before information becomes public if it ever does. It's possible that I'm wrong but history has shown that the USA has had a hand on destabilizing every single communist country. Whether it would have happened anyway is beside the point.
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:58:38
I hope you realize that Venezuela is socialist only in name. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:27:55
True. But bitcoin could be globally accepted everywhere and people will continue to talk about price.

It'll reach 5 million before my dad finally sets up his coinbase account. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:12:01
I’m not convinced that that is actually true. We perceive it that way. We only experience products once they reach the market. The last 5 are products not tech. New industries take much longer than products to make an impact. I recently read something that stated that it’s getting harder and harder to make huge technological breakthroughs. Most new technology is incremental. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:58:18
What I mean is we perceive current technology advances as much more significant then they actually are. 1903 the Wright Bros flew the first airplane only 11 years later they played a huge role in WW1. The rate of change with autos, airplanes, recordings, electricity was huge during that period. But they just show up as an asterisk in our history books.  It's not going to be any different with today's tech. Facebook, Twitter, Pokemon Go aren't even going to make it on the timeline in history books 100 years from now. It will be computers, internet, cellphones. Maybe AR/VR yet to be determined. Unless Bitcoin completely revolutionizes the financial system (I hope it does) it might not even make the list. 
Edit: Pretty sure sliced bread only took about 3ish years to become a common household thing. Couldn't find exact numbers but it spread pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:45:53
So they're naming hurricanes after BTC now?

I learned about it recently from Gladwell’s podcast episode. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:27:43
USD has the most adoption of any currency and people still talk about price. You’re not going to escape it. And price isn’t entirely tied to how many people are using it.

I wouldn’t say that. The bitcoin paper is larger and is worth insignificantly more than the other pieces of paper.

What they did was trace back through the blockchain until they could connect it with known users. This isn't something new. And they didn't crack or unmasked anything. Just connected the dots. The real achievement was the excellent work the detective team did on catching these guys.

@_date: 2019-06-19 17:56:18
Which is why I don’t understand why shitcoins use a blockchain. A blockchain only makes sense when the whole network is decentralized. Adding a blockchain to a centralized network is just adding the complexity without the benefits. How is Facebook coins going to be any different than Microsoft credits?

In this case Quadriga was considered trustworthy until the guy who holds the keys died.
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:13:01
First off it doesn’t mean one person has control. And control doesn’t mean that they have all the machines. My understanding is the biggest pools are run from there. Miners could literally stop using those pools. 
2nd, a 51% attack requires at least 51% to be probable. Still unlikely. In theory a 51% attack could be done with one miner if they were lucky enough. Either way it’s unlikely to happen. 
3rd, unless the goal is to destroy Bitcoin at any costs it doesn’t make sense. It’s just not worth it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:01:07
What’s the point of this?

Except credit cards only have the perception of real-time. The accounts are not settled until much later which causes huge amounts of fraud and high fees.

Not entirely silly. Anyone can start a Walmart competitor but it doesn’t mean people will shop there. Bitcoin has more security and more distribution and is more decentralized. And there’s the network effect too. Try starting a new Facebook and it’s not so easy.
