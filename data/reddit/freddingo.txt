Well, sometimes the truth sucks.  I still think that in 2 years time BTC will be touching 30k. So 5k this year still has anyone who bought in 2017 before August is still up ~500%, and my ghetto prediction follows the past patterns of how BTC has fluctuated.  It may not go that low, but I have been following Bitcoin since the CPU mining days, so I have lost my ability to be shocked by anything after seeing multiple 85% drops and 1000% increases.  It is still so young that it is easily manipulated and these kinds of spikes are to be expected.

I sorta think it will drop to ~5k, but I would never sell anything at this point (with Lightning on the horizon).  Instead, I would buy all the way down, and on the rebound.

Or they have a belief that the 'new coins' are technically superior cause they are 'faster.'  Which might be partially true, but they are forgetting that BTC is in active development and handles 2000x the traffic that the 'faster' shitcoin has.

I went to the bank the other day to do a money transfer (someone was buying my car from another state).
Long story short: It took 45 minutes to find out how to get the money from their account into my account with a moderate level of trust. The total cost was around \~$12 (same bank..) in order to do a transfer that couldn't be reversed.
Whole time I was just thinking about how much easier BTC transfer would have been.
Side note: Bank tellers / managers are not the most highly paid individuals. My wife (works at a bank) was  having to guide the employees at the branch we went to in order make sure it was done correctly and with the proper level of insight that made us comfortable that we wouldn't get ripped off.  So, people who think 'crypto is hard' should see the hoops it takes when not dealing directly with cash.

Think more evil... what if he is Satoshi and taxes were the reason he was hiding this whole time?
* Before bitcoin took off he owes millions in taxes in Australia
* A project that created only hundreds of thousands of dollars (bitcoin in early years) was created... note that he still owes Australia Millions.
* Creates alter ego to keep small amount of bitcoin income protected from taxes
* Increase in bitcoin value.  Does he suddenly want to take his bitcoin and sell all of it to pay his taxes?  Nah.  Cause no one knows it is him!  Hands large amount to friend with clause that it would come back (likely to find a way around taxes...)
* Moves to England in order to evade Aussie taxes, decides he can reveal himself now that he has a tax sheltered strategy in place?

Sadly that won’t fix other countries and their innovation deficits.  My parents generation as well as my generation (over 30) still has a wide swath of technical ineptitude.

I follow both and would quickly down vote useless doge posts showing up in the bitcoin sub.
  Although I would like to point out that the doge coin attitude is something that can benefit bitcoin. The herd mentality has quickly shot doge above many other alts. This is an opportunity for bitcoin to take the best of an alt that does not require a code change, bit coin can welcome the community and adapt. Blocking all alt posts keeps bitcoin down the old path. Maybe it is time to adapt and take the best of doge, the community aspect.

Quick review after a full read: Lots of ‘bad’ items exposed but no actual solution or ‘here is how to fix it.’  Which means this is just an opinion piece and a bit too ‘black and white’ which is even further highlighted by the section named “The Death Spiral” which seems a bit dramatic.   Every item that he has highlighted as bad could be countered with a separate opinion piece that would seem just as positive.  For example:  Rising fees going to miners is seen as a bad thing in his rant.  But basic economics means more $ going to miners will create more interest in being a miner.

I didn't sell, but I did stop mining at a time when I shouldn't have.  I mined about ~5 coins over a weekend when GPU mining software was just released.  After that weekend I did the math on my power cost vs. the value of BTC and decided against mining because it 'wasn't profitable' with my 7990 at the time (and I couldn't game while mining).  So I deleted the wallet and continued on in life.  I came back to the mining scene when BTC was around $100, but I still think back to when the first GPU mining client came out and how awesome it would have been to have stuck with mining in those early days.  Now - I basically just watch and buy a little here and there.

Did a little checking, if you were doing dollar cost averaging this would mean that you would have to have bought / sold somewhere around ~100 BTC or so in any of the years (2014/2015/2016).  Of course, there were times when 20 BTC would have triggered this (late 2015) or 2 BTC would trigger this (today)

But what if you don't have BTC on the exchange?  What price do you wait for in order to be OK with a $5-10 fee in order to sell your BTC?   This means there is reduced liquidity if people are using off-exchange wallets (please everyone, do this).
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:24:50
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:50:05
So the spam attack increases mining fees, likely decreasing liquidity. 
 If you also coordinated with a move to increase the price of bitcoin via the markets, it would be easier because of the reduced liquidity.  You gain fees, as well as increased pricing to offsite the spam attack.  Seems legit. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:52:06
But it is a simple math problem. If we guess that of 500,000 people - 10% decide not to move their money because of increased fees.  That is still 50,000 people.  If each of them have .25 btc they wanted to sell that results in 12,500 less btc for sale.  Fees (taxes) have been proven to be effective in reducing all sorts of behaviors, and I my guesses are well below the number of people with BTC.
