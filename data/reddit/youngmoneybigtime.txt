That’s the problem. Going nowhere fast.

This is much like one of those Eddie Murphy movies, only in this movie Charlie Lee plays all the characters. Horrific.

The bottom? Not even close. As I mentioned on another post, the general public doesn’t embrace the “hodler” mentality, and absolutely does not have the stomach for losing money for months in end. 
When it was up 1,000 a week, everybody and their grandmother was running off to throw their cookie jar money into Coinbase, but that’s changing fast. 
What, at this point, would drive the price up? It’s not new anymore. The hype has died down. Grandma has read twenty Forbes articles about the bubble bursting and has already cashed out. 
Still think Bitcoin is nipping at the heels of USD for the title of “King of World Currency” ? 
Still hanging on to the possibility of being some rags-to-riches invest 2k and net 2mil story? 
Where’s all the optimism coming from at this point?

Yes, but do you really believe that will happen, or is this simply an exercise in useless math?

The 2,000 dollar moon

Impossible? What, with all this recent success Bitcoin is having? 
What, at this point, gives anyone the impression this is a dip to be followed by a bull run as opposed to a crash?

Whoa! Tom Lee says?! 
Well my friend Tim Lee says that Bitcoin will hit 25 cents by end of year. 
Who should I believe?!?!

When it was going up a thousand a week even my grandma was interested. The general public doesn’t have the stomach for these dips. It’s fun for everyone at first, until you’ve been losing money for three months. The hype that pushed BTC to 20k is long gone, I suspect, and the number of folks cashing paychecks on Friday and running off to Coinbase hoping to be the next crypto-millionaire is slowly dwindling as a result. 
So much excitement swirling around stories of 2,000 dollar investments creating multi-millionaires, but those days are long gone at least for BTC investors.

The technology? Old, and shit compared to dozens of other cryptocurrencies now. Uses more fucking electricity than 10,000 football stadiums. The future looks grim if you take off your blinders. 
The shit that brought optimism in the beginning was the price going up. Nobody with half a brain ever thought a decentralized cryptocurrency was ever going to take down the big banks and rise like some fucking Phoenix over gold and government currency. 
And as for decentralization, LOL. 
Keep up wearing that HODL t-shirt, it’ll look great with that bag you’ll be carrying around.

After a few months of the value continuing 
to plummet, coupled with zero adoption,  I’m sure millions will be lining up to throw more money at Bitcoin, driving the price to the moon! 
If you have any hopes for a Lambo, either build a time machine or throw your 2,000 bucks at something else.
