I invested 50€ into Genesis Mining one month ago and so far i got approximately 3€ back. At the beginning i got ~0.000148 btc, but in the middle of the month it went down to ~0.000123 btc ber payout. My guess is, that payout will slowly decrease until it is not profitable for them and then stop completely.

This is total bs, but here is my address XD

That's obviously korean.

The better question is: Why not Oldschool Runescape?
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:45:33
You meant Buy Hodl right?

Thank you all for your recommendations. The possibility to connect a hw wallet in watch-only mode seems nice! I didn't know about that. :)

You forgot 4.5 ????

I invested ~50€ in Genesis Mining for 0.25TH/s in july and first i got ~0.00014 BTC per day but after a month it dropped to 0.0001 BTC per day (Edit: Payout is now 0.0002 BTC every two or three days). In the 4 months since i started i made a total of 9,5€.

I did as you suggested and it seems, it started to download some blocks, but now it's stuck again at block 313154. Here is the log of the new started bitcoind:  
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:28:58
I disable IPv6 and the errors stopped, but i dont think the problem is solved. I only stopped the symptoms.
@_date: 2016-09-20 09:27:21
The bitcoind process uses 0-0.7% cpu and 13% mem.
@_date: 2016-09-20 15:30:16
Yes there is only 1 connection. What shoul i do about it?
@_date: 2016-09-20 09:15:45
I use the ppa and installed bitcoind with apt-get. I do not use a init script, instead bitcoind is started on reboot with the command bitcoind -daemon. After i restarted it today it downloaded some blocks, but now its stuck again at block 313154.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:36:27
Bitcoind is running. Log: 
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:25:28
I disable IPv6 and the errors stopped immediately, but nevertheless i got only 2-3 connections. Shouldn't the syncing of the Blockchain start even with 1 connection.
@_date: 2016-09-20 15:36:37
Thank you for the info and your help. I hope i can resolve this problem somehow.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:28:25
Yes. Could this be the problem?
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:13:38
I used  to check if my node is reachable and it says, that the port is open and my node is running.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:22:09
I upgraded my server to ubuntu lts 16.04 and installed everything new, but the problems still persist. The last 30 lines of my log are all the same:
2016-09-20 13:06:16 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)
2016-09-20 13:10:45 receive version message: /bitnodes.21.co:0.1/: version 70002, blocks=430670, us=84.112.244.84:8333, peer=75

If you just want to see if your wallet works use a faucet.
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:32:57
My bitcoin.conf is empty, could this be? Can i use onlynet=ipv4 to ignore ipv6 addresses?
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:04:33
Hm. The server has an i5 and 8gigs of RAM. Nothing else is running on it and my internet connection should be fast enought ( down 45 Mbps up 7.5 Mbps ). I have many errors in my debug.log, but i dont know what the problem is.

O_O WTF!?
I just asked for advice, because I have a problem with my kraken account, and nothing else.
I don’t know what you are talking about.

Maybe they have such ocean scanning facilities, but why should they care? This city doesn’t have to be hidden from them.
I don’t think that a city in the ice would be good idea. What if the global warming melts the fundament of the city?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:15:40
Hm… that’s unfortunate, but maybe it would be possible to create a sovereign state for the city.

Well... To deposit € via SEPA, the name on my bank account must match the name on my Kraken account. Unfortunately the name on my Kraken account is not my full name, but two times my family name.
@_date: 2016-07-31 07:39:57
I don’t know if this is technically possible, but imagine an independent city on the bottom of the ocean. Something like Rapture. There would definitely be enough free space XD.

The name on my bank account must match the name on my Kraken account, but the name on my Kraken account is not my full name. Somehow I entered two times my family name. Maybe it was due to the Chrome autofill option.
