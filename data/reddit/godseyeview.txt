Yeah and all these other dipshits needed to do was make tx id work like its suppose to instead of what is it which is a welcomeMessage field which may or may not appear in the blockchain because of a man in the middle attack.  Which btw is exactly what you are proposing which does not solve the problem at all but is an ugly hack identical to the ugly hack that caused this ddos attack in the first place.   Bitcoin devs take some responsibility for crashing bitcoin this time.   Quit throwing mtgox under the bus for a known flaw in bitcoin for over 3 years.  Maybe instead of writing wiki articles about it actually do some real work and fix exploits instead of expecting stupid insecure work around from exchangers and users.

I always wondered if people like you know what a pathetic apologist you are or are you under some mistaken impression that you have any critical thinking ability whatsoever.

and instead of including the transactionID in the checksum, writing a wiki article about it so exchangers, colored coin contractors and users have to check date/amount/address as if this was a some kind of feature is what you consider normal.  Or as your incredibly stupid idea proposes add your own transactionId as a message which also isnt included in the checksum so it actually does nothing but pollute the blockchain with garbage is best practice. 
Lets see mtgox are idiots right and not the "developers", except because of this protocol exploit ddos attack Bitstamp, BTC-E, and Bter all suspended withdraws now.  But lets not make txID work as intended, no lets just write a wiki about it.  i'm sure all technology built on top of bitcoin like colored coin contracts will automatically know to check date/amount/address if mtgox hadnt publicly exposed this flaw because the devs were unwilling to do anything for 3 years.
