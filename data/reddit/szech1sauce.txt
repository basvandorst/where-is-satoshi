So you pay a $25 transaction fee for your $5 meal, and wait 10 minutes for the payment to process? Nope.

That's cool, but I'm not gonna trust an app made by a 16-year-old to be cryptographically secure.

Wtf do you mean unknown. A country either banned it, or they didn't.

NiceHash sounded like bullshit from the moment I found out what it is.  "Selling your hashrate to other people"?  Why don't these "rich investors" just buy their own fucking ASICS/miners instead of "renting" "hashrate" from us plebes?

Does anyone else believe that, based on his flawless English, Satoshi is American (or English/Canadian/Australian)?  Also he's obviously trying to conceal his identity. So it would make sense that he didn't pick a common/generic English/Anglo name, that would further suggest his real identity.

I think so

There's nothing private about knowing someone's first name and that they're interested in something that literally millions of other people are as well

GOOD THING YOU BLURRED OUT YOUR FIRST NAME.  GOD FORBID WE LEARN THAT THERE EXISTS A DUDE NAMED "STEVE" WHO IS INVOLVED WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY.  THAT WOULD BE A DEVASTATING BREACH OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

This is basic-ass shit that you can say easily Google in 5 minutes (in case you didn't know what a fork is)
