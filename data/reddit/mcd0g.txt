Or it could be a RAID 1 device. This is just one of the required two!!!

Exactly. That's how you do it. Crypto does NOT need more government intervention. We self regulate with our business.

I used Changelly the other day to get some XRP. I like their platform a bit more, can see your history of transactions.

The unintended benefit here is BTC keeps increasing, so I'm not complaining so much ...
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:13:38
Yes I expect BCH to pop once our friends from (primarily China) start work. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:49:48
lambo time! I'm HODLING!
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:42:37
How do you figure that? Your trend lines don't go down to 3220...
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:21:36
It eventually went through. Just an hour and a half after I sent. Once Shapeshifter got it, the conversion and sending of BCH was fairly quick.

Also need to make  they don't use top level domains that fall under the US jurisdiction. .com is a big no no! Even though ICANN administers these domains and they're technically NGO, they are still within the US jurisdiction.

No.  It's too late any way, but you don't want it on coinbase if you want BCH .

I sent from an exchange (in Asia), fees were .00006970 for roughly .222 of bit of BTC
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:54:21
Haha, sorry! I meant Trezor!
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:23:24
Bummer. Maybe send them a note? They've been pretty good for me, but I only did 2 or 3 transactions with them. One bounced because I messed up the destination address, but they refunded pretty quickly.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:59:53
Also, BCH supports much larger blocks, so...
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:20:18
Buy on an exchange like coinbase but transfer off immediately for your safety. You can either go old school Low tech paper wallet like  (there are many!) or go for a hardware wallet like Trezor.
I have a hard time trusting a computer (or worse, phone)-based software wallet. Your computer could be compromised, keys stolen.

I don’t think there’s any way to get a remotely close estimate. Btc sitting in someone’s wallet, you can see it but you have no idea if the wallet is accessible by anyone or not...
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:23:59
chances are, if BCC tanks, the average person out there (me included) will be too slow to do anything. So I'll just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:29:22
It's all part of the fun though! ;-)
