You can store BTC in a toaster? ELI5 this post. Also if this is actual 3000 BTC and not a joke or something then idk. Congratz on becoming a millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:39:26
EL5: What just said said in this comment.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:24:31
Wait how did you do that? I'm also under 18 got banned on coinbase with the parental thingy. Made an account for my mom with her consent. And got banned again. Accidently gave ID to blockchain.info and now I can't buy from them either. Basically can't buy from coinbase + blockchain not sure where to buy
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:30:53
I meant using your currency to buy bitcoin. I just saw a video where a guy had a bitcoin debit card which he used to withdraw money. When I say money I mean local currency. I'm asking if you do the opposite. Use money / local currency to get bitcoin by going to an ATM and using your card.

Lost around $4000 to scams and gambling. These two were connected. I know the feeling.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:10:16
Backup of the paper wallet? as in 2 copies?
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:00:29
No idea why. Set up my account and went through all the ID things, the parental shit and all that. But my account got restricted. 4 months after my support ticket I got a reply saying that they no longer support users under 18 years old. In the meantime I had created an account in my moms name but that account also got restricted. No reply on support ticket there. You can go to their subreddit. Lots of users are complaining about it just like me.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:05:54


you need to be 18 plus to use that site tho. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:00:10
well reddit, the news and even the news in denmark it showed up
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:28:19
Damn I'm 14 as well and I can't buy via coinbase. Got myself and my mom banned lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:07:56
I contacted with him 14. november but never seems like he sent it. 
He sent me this link once: 
The transaction could only be found on this blockchain site but not it doesn't exist again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:18
I think it's very liekly
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:26:40
Well at least I'll be a multimillionare in my own currency in 15 years
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:13:13
And what would this mean? That I'll receive the bitcoins? Cuz it's not showing up on my ledger
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:14:34
If this is true that's amazing. I'm a 14 year old too that wish to get much more into Bitcoin but sadly can't. I wanted to get into bitcoins 3 years ago at the age of 11 just like you but the only reason I wanted bitcoins then was just to get some CSGO skins
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:22:49
Yeah cryptos is already small. Lets stand together. I don't mean that there shouldn't be competition. Competition is good but no reason to make new users know about Bitcoin because of all the negative things
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:53:35
Link doesn't work anymore. What would this mean
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:08
75k at 2020? lul you're not bullish
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:57
You can have mine when we hit 100k ;)
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:51:48
Is a hardware wallet a wallet you control?
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:37:20
Only for australians? :/
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:02:19
I didn't mean that you needed to go back through the survey. I just didn't understand the sentence at first. Thanks a lot, I'll look through it 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:56:06
whats signiture campaign?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:26:31
copy paste from ?
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:43:43
can you explain why you think so?
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:13:23
It's more of a survey to see which type of people are into bitcoin. So using this subreddit is fine
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:53:29
Thanks for the feedback. I've fixed the banking question and I'm looking for the physical typos. What do you mean by "Last few questions were a bit to similar for me." though?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:46:47
Oh. That's because I was editing for a while but didn't finish. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:06:52
Yeah. Will be on Friday or in the weekend as I want as many results as possible 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:03:16
why picture instead of twitter link
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:03:48
Thanks a lot. I'll show the results of the survey on friday but the presentation is on monday 
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:24:48
If he doesn't get the best grade I'll personally come to your house and steal that ledger
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:39:38
I'll give you an internet cookie. *Hands internet cookie*
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:39:24
Thank you ^^
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:46:30
Haha. No fees on the cookies though so you'll have to wait a while
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:55:01
Thanks. The presentation needs to be 20 minutes afraid that this survey is a bit too long with too many questions. Do you have any opinion on this?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:34:45
look at the market cap too
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:16:58
Reddit was my primary source. I'm not religious myself and never really learned much about it but I would expect that religious people don't really interest as much in technology as non-religious do. That's just my guess
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:38:58
oh yeah thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:49:39
100k by 2024? Are you kidding me mate. That's low
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:07:36
So you think they would recolor it for their own qr?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:00:03
Yeah this is extremely low. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:13:24
Wait you just put up a BTC logo with a wallet and people donate? What
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:05:22
Ahh okay thought that the segwit address was connected to the 2x hardfork and by using that address I would get the 2x coin.
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:43:21
ELI5 please. What is this?
