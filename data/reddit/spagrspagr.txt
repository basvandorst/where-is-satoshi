You are not following it with interest. You are [ChageNow.io]( itself. Don't pretend otherwise, to call Privcoin a phishing website just exposes your ignorance and stupidity. Or i guess they are scammers too, because you stole money from them? Anybody you steal money from is apparently a scammer? 
What is [Changenow.io]( Crypto police? or an exchange. I see that after stealing user funds, you have now updated your TOS that you are no longer anonymous? That is after stealing funds? Keep trying, we will bury you. And oh by the way idiot, your messages are copy and paste too. 
**Thieves!** 
**You stole from Privcoin :** [**
**You stole  from ni23457:** [**
And from many others when they decide to speak up.

Changelly are posing as some kind of legal entity, that has the right to withhold funds from depositors while demanding KYC. This is all crap, they are nobodies, operating under fake names and aliases, hiding behind shell companies in 3rd world countries to steal users funds. So called CEO uses a fake name, Bere. I wouldn't trust them. [
