I don't see this as a big deal but maybe I'm crazy. Removing preferential treatment and incentives will likely have a positive effect in the long run. Geographic diversity would improve, for one. Also, if mining operation overhead goes up, I would expect that to carry through to coin prices too.

Honestly, AMD and Nvidia have a huge retail customer opportunity in the ASIC miner realm. The tech refresh would far outpace video cards and I think it's safe to say at this point that the demand is there. They also have the benefit of economies of scale.

It seems like you're roughly describing colored coins. Not sure if this could be implemented with LN but I would guess most here would shy away from it for reasons of unnecessary centralization.

I don't think you understand how this whole thing works. Are you aiming to learn or is it more to mock our "stupidity"? Genuinely curious. There are many of us who will help educate but I can't actually tell if that's what you're after.

Just to clarify, I said neutral to positive for BTC.
Completely my speculation:
I say this because ICOs issued on ETH would have to put on the brakes whereas RSK isn't as far along and therefore there aren't any SEC/CFTC laws being broken (if that determination is made). ETH ICOs might get reeled in a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:20:44

I'd help but I haven't used blockchain.info in a long time so I don't know what rebroadcast options are available. Does it support RBF? If there are no confirmations you should just be able to send again with a higher fee. It will be a double spend attempt but without confirmations, the higher fee attempt will likely clear before the older, lower one.

@_date: 2018-01-17 07:02:28
An on-chain speed increase would be a hard fork, lowering the block time. If your transaction is included in a block, that's the first confirmation. Every block after that are subsequent confirmations.
Lightning Network is layer two and off-chain. What speed-up are you talking about?
Edit: I think I finally understand your question. It seems you are thinking that the first confirmation is what gets the transaction on-chain and everything after that are on-chain confirmations? That's not how it works. Each block "confirms" all the transactions that were included in that block and all transactions from previous blocks. Block time is 10 minutes (on average) so each confirmation (once a tx is included in a block) takes about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:47:54
I'd say the first step is to join the mailing list and Slack channel. Look at the GitHub. Most likely start helping with documentation. Many developers hate that aspect.

Honestly, neither. ASICs make all other options less than profitable.

I hate to read this. Stay strong, brother.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:38:02
There are payment processors you can use. 
Lightning isn't ready for this yet.
I think mycelium gear is still around too (which as I understand it is a roll-your-own payment processing method). This and the above mentioned processors allow you to denominate in fiat using the exchange rate at the time of purchase.

Not that I've seen but it fits. I thought I made sure my post clearly described my confidence in this scenario.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:50:22
Yes. It's called coin control. Armory does it but you need a full node running. Electrum also has it but doesn't require a full node.
I don't know what other popular wallets have coin control but that's what the feature is called.
Edit: clarified
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:15:03
Yes. Just send directly from one account to the BTC deposit address for the other.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:55:05
I actually didn't realize it was 0.0918 BTC per share. I always thought it was 0.1 (I could have sworn that's what I read multiple times when GBTC was announced).

@_date: 2018-01-18 20:52:31
Not true in the slightest. Do you run a full node? Do the math on how big the blockchain would be and then consider having to replicate that every time you want to set up a node. I've done it - multiple times. It's getting to be kind of annoying and I have gigabit internet. Downloading is one thing - scanning the chain at initialization is something people don't think about. Additional layers have to happen. I don't think anyone who argues to the contrary has any credible and substantial argument to support it.

Addresses that start with a 3 are P2SH ("Pay to Script Hash") addresses. This means there is some type of script involved with the address &amp; transaction. Multisignature addresses are one example but a P2SH-P2WPKH (a segwit address, "Pay to Witness PubKey Hash", nested in a Pay to Script Hash address) is another. 
See [\*here\*]( for more info.

Yes. Anyone can create one. It's the network behind it that gives it value / utility though.
There used to be a website with a form for parameters that you could fill out and it would create the coin for you. I think it evaporated though. The closest thing I could find in the 2 minutes of Googling was this:

This is sort of how I look at it too in some respects, with the added condition that I should consider "withdrawing" within a year to come with a penalty, similar to early 401(k) withdrawals and short term capital gains. It might not be a loss if I liquidate within that timeframe but I think about it like it will.

I'd stay away from price, personally. Blockchain metrics only, I'd say. Here are some ideas:
*Number of Satoshis left to mine
*Blocks to next halving (with estimated time to next halving assuming 10 minute blocks)
*Hash rate
*Number of nodes

It is nonsense then because new user verifications are taking a long time. You're looking at 2-4 weeks most likely before you'll be able to buy. I recommend you start the registration process now just so that's all taken care of when you actually want to pull the trigger.

This was covered before. It's because many people use the "favorite" feature of Twitter as a bookmark / flag to save something. I don't remember who pointed it out but it's because the feature set of Twitter is limited. Similar to how some people "delete" emails in Outlook to save them. Yes it's crazy but that's what some people do.

Maybe. Maybe not. I'll say this though: I'll never forget when I first started mining, the "crazy long" amount of time it took me to mine a block to get only 50 bitcoins, and the math I did to conclude that the whole thing was stupid because I was spending more in electricity than the coins were worth. I deleted the software and wallets and dismissed it.
I came back, obviously, but those coins are gone forever. Value is all relative. Are you happy with the returns and knowing you're contributing to the network? I think it's as simple as that.

I still very much believe it was more an overall crypto bubble than a specific BTC (or ETH) bubble. There are those of us who have been through this before. The only alt that really survived was LTC (this was before ETH). Peercoin was a really significant contender and  Primecoin was interesting too - but they (and many others) faded into obscurity. I expect the same to happen with most of today's alts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:58:36

Armory maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:44:45
Not likely. bc.i shows unconfirmed transactions too. I also checked blockchair just in case it was a BTC/BCH error but that txid shows nothing there either.

You might want to check out the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator.
There was also someone a few days ago who was talking about order flow analysis (which I had seen once before at least a year ago). I don't think he had a bullish / bearish position but he asserted that the model fit well in his trading history. I wish I had saved that thread.

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:15:15
The main thrust is this is putting the brakes on ICOs and the assertion that they're securities and as such are under CFTC / SEC jurisdiction, so to speak. I don't know how you enforce it though with a decentralized and global system. I see this as potentially short term negative for ETH (probably not longer term), and neutral to positive news for BTC (for things like RSK).

When did you return and what brought you back? My story is similar. When I wanted to sign up for a Usenet indexing service VIP account, BTC was the only method of payment they accepted. It was then that I rethought my previous assessment and actually took the time to learn about it. What a crazy ride it's been, eh?
Funny thing is that I'm just as excited about it now as I was then. Maybe moreso.

Honestly it's not economically feasible to mine right now for the most part. Just like you leave gold mining to specialists, the same is becoming increasingly true for Bitcoin mining. It's usually best to just buy it on an exchange and run a full node if you want to contribute to the network.

I disagree completely. The earlier concerns / downsides are brought to light, the less overall effort it will take to adequately address them.

I'm sure their reasons are different from my own, but I actually don't mind paying that for some of my transactions (and I have recently for some very large transactions) since it's supporting the miners.
Honestly 100 sat/B isn't so bad depending on what you send. I'm personally not out to pay the absolute minimum all the time (sometimes I do, but not always). You're providing a service to help me move, for example, $20k worth of BTC? I honestly don't mind tossing you $5 or $10 worth of BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-27 21:05:37
No. People deep down knew they were talking a risk with an alt. No BTC was lost and there are only two scenarios : either they dump them to fiat or convert to another crypto. If crypto, it either increases the value of BTC or keeps it the same.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:57:48
Maybe because it's not a true representation of what's actually been put into the market. Order books are so thin on alts that small money makes big moves.

This gives a pretty good summary of how it works and could work in the future and I think answers all of your questions (don't be surprised if you walk away with more questions than you started with - such is the way in Bitcoin land).

We've been through this before with Huobi and BTCC (maybe others, not sure). No-fee trading is a slippery slope and one should not consider the volume to be in any way valid when traders can paint the tape with impunity.
It also calls into question their business model. All I'm saying is be cautious (as if that needs to be said in the world of Bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:52:29
You may very well be correct. I imagine, however, that your scenario wouldn't work because I doubt anyone would just say "I'll just let it time out" and do nothing. More likely, they spend from the same address and make any previous unconfirmed attempt a double-spend afterwards. I know since I have done this myself. If you don't want something to go through and it hasn't confirmed, just spend to a different address with a higher fee.

I think this idea is a good one. I think it should be a pre-determined bounty (or list of bounties) rather than a blanket donation. But maybe that's against the spirit of the pineapple fund.

US government shutdown because they didn't approve a budget in time. There are some people speculating that a government shutdown could end up reducing faith in the USD and therefore result in BTC increasing in value.
Personally I think there's no correlation and regardless of what happens with the government, BTC will do what BTC does, independently.

So glad it worked out. Not that I'm at all surprised.
FWIW, I'm not so sure divesting into alts is the best course of action. I've been there. You don't want to know how many BTC I've lost as a result of those gambles.
The beauty, however, is that my opinion doesn't matter and you can do what you think is best. Just do yourself a favor and learn the differences in the alts you end up considering before you back them.

Big banks push back on launch of bitcoin futures
US regulators told financial system ill-prepared for dealing with cryptocurrencies
8 hours ago

The world’s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared.
On Wednesday, the price of bitcoin climbed to a fresh record high of more than $14,000. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market.
However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry.
The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday.
In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures “did not allow for proper public transparency and input”.
The CME and CBOE agreed to operate under a self-certified regime for their upcoming contracts, meaning regulators had minimal time to review them formally.
Using it for “these novel products does not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed”, the draft reads.
The CFTC warned last week during its approval process that the emerging cryptocurrency markets were largely unregulated and the agency had “limited statutory authority”.
“It is also our understanding that not all risk committees of the relevant exchanges were consulted before the certification to launch these products,” the letter added.
Futures brokers are worried they will bear the brunt of the risk associated with bitcoin futures, because the margin that backstops the contract is placed in a clearing house.
Clearing houses stand between two parties in a trade, managing the risk to the rest of the market if one side should default. They are mutually funded in part by banks to guard against the failure of their largest members.
Several brokers among the top 10 largest providers have privately confirmed to the Financial Times that they will not clear the products immediately.
CBOE said its futures exchange did not have a risk committee, but it consulted with its board and regulatory oversight committee. The OCC, its clearing house, also has a risk committee that reviewed the product.
In its filing, CME said it had discussed the specifications of the contracts with customers for around six months. It did not have an immediate comment on Wednesday.
The backstory
San Francisco reporter Chloe Cornish selects the stories that explain the concerns behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin
One clearing broker said that it would be open-minded about cryptocurrencies, as they were US dollar products, but only if they were “properly controlled and regulated”. However he added: “We’d still be on the hook in a worst-case scenario as we are exposed as members of the clearing house.”
Bob Fitzsimmons, head of Wedbush Futures, a non-bank broker, said his company would back both the CBOE and CME products from day one. “We could sit for hours and have a philosophical debate about bitcoin and its legitimacy and uses, but our job is to service our customers,” he said.
Other exchanges are showing interest in bitcoin futures but are more cautious. Thomas Book, chief executive of Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Exchange, said timing was crucial in launching a new derivatives contract.
“We still do see challenges that have to be tackled in close discussion with our clients. It is important for an exchange to follow a sustainable approach on this asset class well co-ordinated with the market.”
Thomas Peterffy, a pioneer of electronic trading and head of Interactive Brokers, has warned that the introduction of bitcoin futures into a clearing house could increase systemic risk. On Wednesday Interactive said its clients would be unable to short the bitcoin futures market because of the extreme volatility of bitcoin.

Quite often (most times?) panel moderators are not the ones to set up panel participants.

Or maybe he has become so incredibly frustrated with the lack of progress and risk aversity that he finally said fuck it and went it on his own to basically present almost irrefutable results that nobody could argue with. His past would then get called into question. "Who the hell is this guy who found a solution to the quandary that's been eating at the dev community for so long?" And of course the immediate assumption is that maybe he's Satoshi. He doesn't want it as its not true but if it makes the solution pill easier to swallow then fine, he'll adopt (or at least not argue against) the persona.
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:39:58
Yes. That's what I mean. Conferences cost money and it's generally profitable for the entity hosting the conference (though not always). It does cost money though - space rental at the venue, marketing, swag, equipment rental, AV, etc. That needs to be paid for somehow and sponsorships are typically the main source of funds (not attendee tickets like many think). So sponsors pledge money and they get some type of benefit - stage time, logos on signs (marketing), etc. So yes, he likely paid the sponsorship fee and got a panel spot.
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:46:06
They don't need to know them. Most of the time there's a marketing outreach (email campaign, Twitter, etc) soliciting for sponsors and attendees for the event. "If you're interested in sponsoring the event, contact so-and-so with your credentials" and then sponsorship levels / prices are discussed. Pay the sponsorship fee and negotiate a panel spot and you're in.
You don't always have to pay to be on a panel though if you're well-known and regarded as knowledgeable or that you'll make the discussion interesting for the audience. Sometimes the conference even pays to have people come in and participate.

I don't think, in the grand scheme of things, this has been going on for too terribly long. It should be vetted and well thought out. I suspect many of those growing impatient haven't experienced the real business world where things just take time.
Yes, it's important and urgent. But I sometimes have to wait 4-6 weeks (or more) to get a work order approved by a client at work. And that's for peanuts stuff. This is potentially much bigger. Patience, friends, as long as we aren't talking in circles - and I don't think we've gotten to that point quite yet.

Ninki is one of my favorite wallets. One of the things I like about it is that it has a uri paste option in addition to a qr code reader. This is nice because you can copy the uri link from a webpage, for example, and then just open the wallet and paste.
You wouldn't think this would be a big deal except on iOS you can't choose the default app associated to uri's. It seems to choose alphabetically. So for me it's greenaddress. Until I installed Copay, then it was that. So I actually had to uninstall Copay to go back to using greenaddress. I use Ninki sometimes if I don't have the funds in my GA wallet or if it's acting wonky.
I've considered moving to Ninki exclusively except, while I like the PIN security, I don't like that it doesn't make use of Touch ID. Since I use it in public most of the time, I don't like punching in my PIN with other people around to see it. The Coinbase app does this the best, imo. Coinbase handles uri's pretty poorly though. Not to mention I don't like that Coinbase has to monitor tx's.
Ninki is probably second on my list of preferred wallets next to greenaddress. Fix a couple things like Touch ID and setting limits based on $ and not btc and it may become my number one.

During our recent yearly tax preparation meeting with our accountant, my wife and I asked her if she had any guidance on tax implications / requirements with bitcoin. Her response was a somewhat befuddled look, 3-5 seconds of silence, and then, "didn't that just go bankrupt?". It was a good gauge of public knowledge / sentiment. It planted the seed, however, and I expect she will go to her circle and discuss it and see if any of her colleagues got similar questions. I also told hear about bitpay / bip / coinbase (since she doesn't accept CC payments for her services because of the "expensive 3% fee") and explained she doesn't have to take any risk if she uses one of those services. She seemed intrigued. I guess we'll see what happens.

Not necessarily. Don't forget that this is just visa's network and doesn't capture cash transactions or the likely increase in transactional volume (to include micro transactions or even machine to machine, automated transactions). It would be reasonable to look at visa, MasterCard, amex, western union, et al to get a clearer picture. To envision even one order of magnitude increase in transactional volume isn't all that far fetched when you really think about it.
That said, I don't think enough people actually think about this. It's going to take some time to mature.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:57:10
Just because anyone can mine doesn't mean everyone will get a cut. Statistically speaking, over a long period of time they will but the share will be proportional to their hash rate. Hash rate has been increasing like mad and has roughly dictated the price based on cost for hardware + cost to operate that hardware. It's not Monopoly money in that it is limited based on the specifications of the protocol. 10 minutes per block, on average, with block rewards halving every 4 years (next halving ~2016).
They have value because the market says there is a value (or potential value in the future) of the technology and its utility.

People seem to forget that the assertion or foundation on which the idea is based is that as the block reward wanes, mining income will be increasingly funded by the volume of transactions and therefore the fees that go along with them. Until Gavin's recent proposed solution to the tx/sec limit of approximately 7 per second, how this would shake out was relatively uncertain. 7 per second at 1c/transaction yields $42.00 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 and you get $1.68 per btc if you were to compare current tx limit to current block reward. This isn't a really fair comparison though.
Visa did approximately 19 billion transactions in one quarter. This equates to a little more than 2400 transactions per second. At 1c/tx, that's $24/second or about $14,400 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 (current block reward) and you get ~$578 per btc.
Now there are several assumptions made here (like the fact that visa is just one of many payment networks and 1c/tx may be too low) and the comparisons aren't perfectly fair but it at least presents it in a way that may be easier for people to understand.

While I love bitcoin and all, your best bet is probably to just get a money order or cashier's check and mail it to him. It will probably be less time for you and also cost you less. If your dad was open to the concept of bitcoin, the answer would be different. But since he's not and he's the recipient, you shouldn't force him to use some system that he isn't okay with.

I think it's important for my son to understand that you need to work for things in life and not just expect them to be given to you; and this includes soliciting for charitable contributions for whatever cause you may see as worthy.
He's seen my interest in bitcoin over time, heard my wife and me talk about it in addition to some conversations with friends and family and he has been very inquisitive about it. It's hard to explain crypto to a 6 / 7 year old but I do what I can.
Recently his school started participating in a fundraiser for the AHA, "Jumprope for Heart" where they are learning about the importance of healthy lifestyles, how the heart plays into it, and the unfortunate truth that some people were dealt a bad hand and have heart issues that require attention.
When he came home with it, one of the first questions he asked was if they could "do bitcoin" (we have to work on terminology a little I suppose). A bit disappointed, I informed them that they don't accept it and that as it's a new thing that most people probably wouldn't donate in that manner.
I hate to diminish his enthusiasm with anything in life, including what I believe to be a potentially disruptive technology like bitcoin; but I am was not aware of any philanthropic avenue for such things for bitcoin and didn't want to simply resort to begging for donations (it's tacky and he wouldn't really learn nothing aside from the fact that begging can yield results).
I asked for recommendations in my previous thread but it didn't really uncover any avenues I was unaware of or other genius ideas on how to raise funds. Not wanting to give up on the idea, we brainstormed a little bit, talked about the importance of being healthy and what that let him do and we worked on the idea together. He was really excited to be putting it together. He learned a bit about story boarding, video capturing, video editing, and we even discussed how bitcoin donations could be converted to dollars to add to the contributions.
He had a blast through the whole thing. He came up with most of the ideas on activities to include that would get his heart pumping. We had too many to include as a matter of fact to keep the total time to 90 seconds or less (I wanted to make it a minute or less but it just felt rushed).
I realize the community has been burnt in the past with people begging or otherwise scamming and I understand any skepticism that anyone may have. If nothing else, he has come out of this knowing more than he did going into it and we had a great time putting it together.

This is not what I mean. I understand how to receive and convert to dollars. What I'm asking is for recommendations on ways to drum up donations in a manner that is more than just posting on bitcointalk / reddit with an address asking for donations. It's not like looking locally for people to donate in BTC is going to get much action. It's an online currency for the most part but there isn't, as far as I'm aware, a philanthropic / donation-friendly avenue for this type of thing.

Not exactly the right place to ask this I'm sure but I'm having trouble figuring something out that you might have the answer for.
I have multiple bitcoin wallet apps on my iPhone - blockchain, greenaddress, coinbase. How does one control which app is the default handler for "bitcoin:" links like you find on coinforcoffee.com? Right now mine defaults to blockchain but my wife's defaults to greenaddress. I see no way to control which it launches. It's also not the most recent installed since I tried installing coinbase on my wife's iPhone and it stayed with greenaddress.
Just an oddity that I couldn't figure out and thought you may have some insight.

Just because design capacity is 10MW doesn't mean they plan on populating it 100% from day one. Actually, fully populating a datacenter from day one is a rarity. Rather, they usually plan in stages designed to spread out over the course of many years. This is usually because the business housed therein (e.g. hosting / cloud services) don't know what future customer base is going to be, but you could assume something similar with this data center. I'd harbor a guess that it's probably either 2 to 2.5MW per phase. Also, the 10MW includes cooling so depending on their [PUE]( it could be much lower than that as dedicated to actual mining gear so it could represent 35-60% of the mining capacity if it was rolled out day one.

While true, the only problem with this is that those people tend to be the weak hands and the first to back out if value decreases by whatever percentage is their breaking point. Not understanding the value / utility makes them make decisions based on emotion rather than rationality.
Each of these is an opportunity, if you're the "consultant", to introduce them to why it's valuable as a technology and any notable developments (good or bad) since they're probably not paying attention. I'm the go-to guy for several of my friends and family; and I like that.

I'll echo a comment I left elsewhere:
People seem to forget that as the block reward wanes, mining income will be increasingly funded by the volume of transactions and therefore the fees that go along with them. Until Gavin's recent proposed solution to the tx/sec limit of approximately 7 per second, how this would shake out was relatively uncertain. 7 per second at 1c/transaction yields $42.00 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 and you get $1.68 per btc if you were to compare current tx limit to current block reward. This isn't a really fair comparison though.
Visa did approximately 19 billion transactions in one quarter. This equates to a little more than 2400 transactions per second. At 1c/tx, that's $24/second or about $14,400 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 (current block reward) and you get ~$578 per btc.
Now there are several assumptions made here (like the fact that visa is just one of many payment networks and 1c/tx may be too low) and the comparisons aren't perfectly fair but it at least presents it in a way that may be easier for people to understand and is, I think, a decent point of reference.

I don't think the government will ban it. Why? Because the US government is bought and paid for by lobbyists and special interest groups, of which the financial sector is a huge player. And whether they see short or long term potential, I think most Wall Street folks acknowledge that there is potentially big money to be made by this Bitcoin craze. But before they have anything to do with it, they need to know how returns are going to be handled since at the end of the day they have to pay (or avoid) taxes in USD. They may see it as a P&amp;D opportunity or a long term play but I think interest is piqued, it just hasn't reached trigger-pulling status yet.
@_date: 2014-12-08 06:06:48
I'm sorry but this is illustrative of how immature the mining market is on the datacenter front. I appreciate that a lot of money and effort is going into this (comparatively speaking) but if you compare this to the datacenters that are built to support financial services, it's so staggeringly substandard that it's comical. If the bitcoin industry is to be successful in the long run, we need to step it up from amateur hour datacenter build philosophies and put our big boy pants on.
Now I know a lot of people are married to the idea of having a raised floor in a datacenter, otherwise it's not a datacenter. I think we are past that notion being the standard, however, and building a datacenter on slab is perfectly acceptable and a lot of big players build on slab - so as far as that goes I think you're fine. What isn't illustrated here, however, is the method of heat rejection (which most people call "cooling"). You say you have hot aisle/cold aisle configuration but that is a lot different from hot aisle/cold aisle *containment*. HA/CA containment separates the air streams from each other such that the hot air doesn't get fed directly back into the supply for the cold(er) air feeding the racks. You lose that in this hardware-on-a-shelf scenario - and whereas the facility itself may pass fire inspection, I would be very skeptical about its ability to maintain the environmental conditions within acceptable limits. You show the inside of the datacenter - but what do you have externally to actually reject the heat? If you're simply using outside air to feed the datacenter and push hot air out, you introduce a lot more complexity to the equation (pollutants, dust, humidity, condensation, etc). This is why [ASHRAE TC 9.9]( exists. Many industry leaders push the limits (and go beyond) the TC 9.9 guidelines but they can afford to because they do things like HA/CA containment or treat them as test environments (and just generally have exceptional engineering teams at their disposal).
You show "vents" but as best as I can tell they are at the perimeter of the room and this is NOT an ideal scenario for the way the ~~racks~~ shelves are laid out. Typically, if you use perimeter cooling, at the very least you blow the air parallel to the aisles such that it goes from both sides into the cold aisles and the return air somewhat naturally comes back overhead from the hot aisles. Also, how is the air supply balanced? Best as I can tell it's simply a supply header with some ducts along the way to distribute the air.
Garage door straight into the datacenter? I'm pretty sure most people would expect some higher security for money-generating machines but maybe my standards are too high.
Let's move beyond the construction, if you want to call it that. How about operations? All of the power / cooling equipment? How do you plan to manage the preventive and corrective maintenance of that to ensure that the equipment stays on and minimize downtime? How about corrective maintenance when something breaks? My guess is you have a "fix it when it breaks" approach and probably don't have concurrent maintainability or even any type of real power / cooling redundancy.
Anyway, for anyone in the datacenter world, this would be far from boast-worthy. From what I have seen and have been able to discern from the photos that *have* been shared, I would not associate myself with this type of build even in the slightest.
Good luck with your venture, however - and double good luck to any customers that decide to pull the trigger here.

I actually agree with his assessment of the conversion to dollars not making it a currency (at least not in the near term). I envision bitcoin's growth starting as an online payment platform through which people exchange goods and services. I think the first wave of it will be as a decentralized remittance platform, dealing mostly in their own, local fiat. Over time, however, I think as people hold a "small" amount for convenience or speculation, market cap will rise and volatility will decline as a result. Will it ever replace fiat? Maybe, but probably not for a long time.   
People also need to remember that there are far more possibilities with the protocol than just currency.

If I had employees ask for a sit down, I'd probably do the same. Hear the concerns and assure them to the extent possible. But I would have no obligation to prove anything to them, nor would I do so, most likely. You have to understand that at the time (and even still) security of bitcoin operations is paramount. And he might not have trusted that the employees wouldn't somehow find something out during those conversations that could inadvertently lead to theft from an employee.

If you set it up with bitpay, you get your own payment URL. You can then add it to your homescreen as if it were an app. You then open it, fill in amounts, and it can then process the payment. It's super easy and once you get your account set up it's in the settings in your account profile.
The good thing about this approach is that it only accepts payments but can't spend. So it's secure in that respect. It's also easy to deploy to multiple field personnel with just a URL and you don't have to have each one sign in with account credentials.

There are actually a few different arguments against taxation:  the ethical argument, the economic argument, and the practical argument. Below, each of them is expanded a little bit so you have a better idea of why libertarians and anarchists are so against taxation.
But first, let's start by pointing out that libertarians are actually striving for the same goals others are. They want everyone to be able to have a job that pays them "a living wage". They want everyone to be able to afford a solid middle-class lifestyle. They want everyone to have cheap healthcare, a great education, a secure retirement, and pothole-free roads. They don't delight in seeing poor people, and they don't get giddy when they see an old person who couldn't save enough to retire comfortably. In this way, they're just like you (assuming you're not Libertarian)
The key difference is, they think there are *better ways to achieve these goals*. It's very similar to when downloading music online was a new thing - initially, there was a ton of push-back. People simultaneously loved Napster, and hated what it was about to do to the music industry. People feared that in the future, musicians would just stop producing good stuff. They thought that if we didn't force people to buy music, only a few very wealthy musicians would make all the music, while smaller and indie bands would die out.
The reality turned out to be the exact opposite. Free music downloads forced the industry to **compete** and give us better options, like Spotify, Pandora, and iTunes. Indie bands have never seen a greater following. The technology has allowed us to discover new musicians that we never would have found otherwise. Musicians are still able to make money by performing live concerts and accepting donations.
This is the approach libertarians want to take with the goods and services traditionally provided by governments. They want open competition. They want people to have the option to use other services, and to pay a different provider.
So the three arguments against taxation are as follows:
1.  The ethical argument. Who commits the worst atrocities in history?  Private businesses or governments?  Unless you're really biased, you'll agree that governments generally kill, kidnap, and steal more than any other organization in human history. When you are studying ethics from a philosophical perspective, you have to avoid internal inconsistencies in your logic. In other words, rules must be applied fairly and evenly in all cases - they must be universal. Taxation can't be universal. It gives one group of people the right to steal from another group of people. This is tantamount to slavery, on a fractional basis. Most Americans work until sometime in late April/early May for the government. All the money they earn between Jan 1 and April 30 is effectively the government's. Slavery, even if fractional, is unethical. Majorities ruling over minorities is also unethical and unjustifiable by any logically coherent ethics philosophy.
2.  The economic argument. Economist Friedrich Hayek's essay on The Use of Knowledge in Society is a highly recommended read. You can read about it here:   Basically the argument is that prices are valuable information that guide production to satisfy consumer desires. Taxation, regulation, price-fixing, inflation, etc all serve to inhibit this information's distribution and asserts that we need free markets to know where to apply our effort. Governments add noise to the market's signals, thus reducing their productive outputs and making everyone poorer.
3.  The practical argument. Politicians are humans. That means they have friends, and they want to get rich (or at least richer than they are when they first entered office). Politicians also seek power and control. This is easily visible in countries like the US, Russia, the UK, China, Italy, etc. but it is also present (to a slightly lesser degree) in smaller states like Denmark, Norway, Peru, New Zealand, etc. Many would argue that governments are monopolists and that there's really no way around it. It may sound like something a topless hippie would be shrieking at an "Occupy Wall Street" protest, but that doesn't necessarily make it any less accurate. The argument is that the vast majority of your tax dollars to go lining the pockets of politicians, their business partners, their friends... and locking up peaceful potheads. Why do they do this?  Because they can. **Because you have no choice.**  But the arguments in favor of taxation cite schools, roads, police (I guess the peaceful kind), and helping poor people. Those things are great. But just because a shit sandwich has bacon on it, doesn't mean the shit sandwich is good. The assertion is that choice &amp; competition always leads to better outcomes for consumers. No, the music industry won't die when people have Bittorrent... and roads, schools, security, firefighters, and healthcare won't suddenly go away when people aren't forced to pay taxes.

I feel the same way now with Bitcoin that I did when I started using Twitter back when it was regarded as a dumb waste of time; who wants to know when you're eating or taking a shit? Also yes, Facebook - though I was a bit late on that as I didn't really see the allure to Myspace either. I've been an early adopter of many things and felt as sheepish about them as I do when discussing Bitcoin with people. I don't really prosthelytize though. People know enough to know I'm interested and I basically wait for them to come to me at this point. It's happened enough to know that it's a valid approach.

There's error correction and checksums built into a bitcoin address. It's not just a matter of a wrong / transposed character screwing you.
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:40:39
It's deterministic, using seed words similar to what you would find in electrum or breadwallet. It doesn't allow you to specify any seed but it does have a series of words that you could conceivably commit to memory if you tie them together similar to the way correct horse battery staple* does. I have a hard time tying that many words together, personally, but that doesn't mean you couldn't do it. Just get the app and have a look - you'll see what I mean.

I got mine and I have to say - it's quite convenient. I'm curious about a few things though...
What is the security of the physical fob? If I use it in an unknown machine, do I need to worry about its security?
I'm still a bit unclear on the recovery of funds if greenaddress.it (which is what I'm using it with) goes belly up. I understand it has nLockTime functionality but I don't fully understand what to do with it, any limitations with the files sent, and other nuances to be aware of.
Can the hardware wallet be overwritten? Say I want to abandon a wallet for whatever reason (or someone gets it and wants to overwrite it) - is this possible?
I have two (got the deal). Do they both have to have the same PIN / access key if the same wallet is written to them or can each key contain the same wallet but have different access PINs?
Is there a FAQ somewhere for the HW.1 / GreenAddress combo?

Lost credibility at "endlessly copied".
Edit: Let me clarify my point a little. I would venture to guess that the vast majority of people reading this do not understand bitcoin and what they know of it thus far is how the media has portrayed it - and recently we have to admit that it's not been all that pleasant of a picture that's been painted. I did read the whole thing and I missed the point of clarification about predecessors able to be "endlessly copied" (or was it the source code?). I actually thought it was strange that they would say that and go on later saying reasonable things about it, seeming to give the benefit of the doubt. It still stood out to me as a conflicting statement. They could have clarified it better. The people who read this are likely going to be ready to jump on anything that discredits bitcoin. It would have been better to say, right after that statement, "but bitcoin found a clever way to address this" - not later.

After seeing the reddit post about the project someone's 10-year-old did on bitcoin, that did cross my mind, actually - but he doesn't really understand it to the level that I think would be required for that type of project / presentation. And even if he did, there's little chance the other kids would get anything out of it as they're 6/7 years old and probably don't have the parental support at home to dig into it further. I've explained things to him over time as he's seen me looking at charts, browsing reddit, and talking to friends / family. In short, he's had a lot of exposure to it and he only vaguely understands it as a concept of money so I'm skeptical that it will have any real impact for him to try to explain any of it to kids in his class who don't even have knowledgeable parents to ask about it.
I appreciate the idea and there may be some way of making it work but I feel like that type of thing would be better to do as a follow-up after the event rather than as a preface to it. I'll certainly give it more thought though. Thanks for the suggestion. :)

What a lot of people don't realize is that those pipes that you see aren't actually filled with water most of the time. There are several different types of fire suppression ([good summary on wikipedia]( You usually require the glass bulb to be broken (from heat) and a combination of smoke detectors or HSSD (high sensitivity smoke detection, though most people call this VESDA but it's really a company name). Several things have to happen to actually discharge the water to the pipe. It's not like you see in the movies.
Then you have FM200 / gaseous fire suppression (though that's pricey and almost certainly not even a possibility for this build given the apparent budget).

Oftentimes hard drives fail slowly and exhibit a knocking noise as they operate. It may be too late since you too k it to Geek Squad (why the heck you would take it there is beyond me vs a proper data recovery firm, but I digress...)
There are a couple things you may want to try. One is putting the HDD in the freezer. This an cause thermal contraction and free any stuck mechanical parts. Only do this if the HDD hasn't been physically opened by GS. If it has, humidity will condense and you may make it worse.
If that doesn't work, you could try a firm smack on a table or solid surface. One smack, or two, flat so the platters are parallel to the surface. This sounds bad but it attempts to accomplish the same thing as above but with obvious additional fervor.
One additional option is to look into a data retrieval firm. should be able to help here.
Finally, use a backup system (e.g. Crashplan) for your wallet.dat or something like Armory where you can restore from a deterministic seed.
Good luck.

I'll echo a comment I left elsewhere:
Until Gavin's recent proposed solution to the tx/sec limit of approximately 7 per second, how this would shake out was relatively uncertain. 7 per second at 1c/transaction yields $42.00 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 and you get $1.68 per btc if you were to compare current tx limit to current block reward. This isn't a really fair comparison though.
Visa did approximately 19 billion transactions in one quarter. This equates to a little more than 2400 transactions per second. At 1c/tx, that's $24/second or about $14,400 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 (current block reward) and you get ~$578 per btc.
Now there are several assumptions made here (like the fact that visa is just one of many payment networks and 1c/tx may be too low) and the comparisons aren't perfectly fair but it at least presents it in a way that may be easier for people to understand and is, I think, a decent point of reference.

If that doesn't work, there are options in Armory to re-build database or something along those lines. One option is quicker the other is a complete re-build (and takes longer). I've only had to do this part once and it was after Windows decided to restart on its own after an upgrade.

It's happened before but it's definitely uncommon. I'm personally of the opinion that Tether is solvent but I acknowledge I could be wrong.
My suspicion / theory is that BFX is leading because it represents the most liquidity and platform operation stability of fiat exchanges (unlike the bitmex casino where login / trade errors are common). It's also one of the oldest exchanges and offers margin. For big players, it's the most attractive and the Tether uncertainty is making those who are understandably skittish continue to sit on their hands.
I've said for months now that I see USDT market cap as a good indicator of sideline money.

It's only profitable because people are buying it. Or more correctly, there is more buy pressure than sell pressure. If people stop buying at these prices or more people sell, it becomes less profitable. And/or more buying pressure on BTC.
I believe that a large part of why there's buy pressure is because there's actually a lot less available supply on BCH because people haven't claimed them yet (myself included) whether it's because they're on an exchange or in their own wallets.
I'd be interested to see a chart of BCH-Days-Destroyed since the fork happened. I'm guessing it wouldn't be very high.

The root of his argument is that "a low inflation bitcoin is better than fiat so that makes it the winning choice". To me this is like saying "a spoon full of shit has less shit than a sandwich of shit so that makes it the winning choice".
I get what he's saying about wealth centralization but to some extent I don't care because even if that is true (which he didn't provide any evidence for beyond "private sources") then the wealth is more centrally held by geeks and early adopters that believed in the technology / concept. I don't think this is a bad thing necessarily when you compare it to the current financial (fiat) elite.
Also, he said 


To that I say, "no shit" and "good". The reason I believe this to not only be the case but to also be a good thing is that I think it separates those who were in it for a quick buck / get rich quick method vs those who see the potential for a groundbreaking and disruptive (and more convenient) technology in the future. Yes, people sold and got out. Yes, some of those people even "got rich" from doing so (and some people lost money). In my opinion this has no bearing whatsoever on the underlying potential and technology.
Finally, he seems to be hanging onto the "limited number" as a hard limit of units / tokens. If we talk in terms of the base unit Satoshi along with the ability to infinitely divide said units, the tokens themselves aren't limited by what we consider to be conventional bounds. He said:


Sure. Why not? What harm does it do when you can infinitely divide Satoshis should the need arise? He's worried about a unit liquidity problem (I think, anyway) and this could easily be achieved down the road with such a division. It would be more akin to a stock split than money printing.
Maybe he'd call me a hard cap purist, I don't know. But at least the way I read that is that he's not thinking about the full picture. To me it reads as if he thinks people (himself included, maybe?) missed the boat and the distribution has happened too quickly compared to market use and adoption. I would pose it the other way, however, that the market (and users) have moved too slowly to adopt a potentially superior technology to anything we have had in the past.

Your dissolutionment is not with Bitcoin but rather the legacy / existing banking systems. The barriers in place are a result of those regulations and controls. Bitcoin, among other things, simplifies this as everything up until now has imposed centralized controls to act as a trusted party because it was necessary.
So your frustrations are well founded but once you see that you aren't frustrated with Bitcoin but rather everything in place now, you'll better appreciate bitcoin's potential.

I understand what you're saying but I'm pretty sure the difference is pre-payment. Once you pre-pay it becomes a lottery. And let's be honest here, once you have that, people are going to feel (or be) pressured to prove their payment. It may not be a compulsory payment but it sure will be strongly encouraged for fear of backlash if someone won.
I've donated to every winner since the beginning. I purposely use straight BTC payment (rather than changetip) because my donating (and how much I donate) is none of anyone's business but mine.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:27:34
Because of the legality, however, it then turns into a lottery rather than a donation. Donations are good to go but lottery is different story (for taxation purposes too). I know a lot of people like to show their disillusionment for the establishment / man but there are a lot of others who prefer to abide by the laws set in place. I am not advocating one way or the other but I do think that people should respect other's choices.

This is simply not true. Example would be elm, Eudora, Thunderbird, and The Gmail web interface (because you can add POP / IMAP accounts in settings). They can all use POP / IMAP but the UX is vastly different between them.

@_date: 2015-07-23 14:47:50
When I typed that up (on mobile) I thought someone may take issue with my using gmail in that list because it is somewhat of an outlier. I used it, however, because you can configure it to be a frontend for other POP / IMAP accounts and therefore it does serve as another UX example for those protocols.
I acknowledge your points about inability to meaningfully upgrade hindering innovation in Gmail but I think it illustrated my point that UX / protocol can (and are in a ton of cases) decoupled.

@_date: 2015-07-09 02:44:14
I'll echo a comment I left elsewhere:
Until Gavin's proposed solution a few months ago to the tx/sec limit of approximately 7 per second, how this would shake out was relatively uncertain. 7 per second at 1c/transaction yields $42.00 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 and you get $1.68 per btc if you were to compare current tx limit to current block reward. This isn't a really fair comparison though.
Visa did approximately 19 billion transactions in one quarter. This equates to a little more than 2400 transactions per second. At 1c/tx, that's $24/second or about $14,400 every 10 minutes. Divide by 25 (current block reward) and you get ~$578 per btc.
Now there are several assumptions made here (like the fact that visa is just one of many payment networks and 1c/tx may be too low) and the comparisons aren't perfectly fair but it at least presents it in a way that may be easier for people to understand and is, I think, a decent point of reference.

Then people seeing that I was making money charging people to come see my version of PF, they also took the first 45 minutes and made their version and charged for tickets.
Then the fan community became annoyed that one chose to show what was in the briefcase and another didn't so more people took *those* versions starting from just before that, because it wasn't Tarantino's vision.

This always happens. New people get into crypto, think they missed the boat with the leaders, and find what they think are interesting alts. Then ultimately most alts don't deliver so people eventually move back to large cap coins. Happens every bull run. Alt investments eventually pivot back to the leaders. Plus a lot of people trade alts just to try to increase their BTC stack.

Honestly, not really. I don't think exchange waits are too long right now though. Just start the process now. You'll want the accounts anyway.
If you're willing to buy a minimum of 25 BTC, you can go the OTC route with a broker like itbit. I've used them in the past. You'll also get the added benefit of buying at somewhat of a discount from spot price.

Keep in mind FIFO is more likely to put you on the hook for long term capital gains whereas LIFO is more likely to be the higher rate, short term capital gains. So it might not be as straightforward. Also, if you bought at / near a top and sold lower, those are claimable capital losses.

It can get even better. My normal drink is $5.04. So I pay $4 for $5 from fold which leaves $0.04. I then use my gold card to pay the remaining $0.04 which gives me a star. So I get 20% off and a free drink after 12 drinks, or $0.48 on the gold card. So for 13 drinks I pay $48.48 instead of $65.52, meaning I save roughly 26% using both deals.

I will often seek out companies that take Bitcoin but if I have to create an account (which shouldn't be necessary if you're not shipping anything and a user is paying in btc) then I think twice. It may not be users leaving because you offer the option to pay in btc but rather would-be btc customers that shy away for some other reason.

This is an incredibly percipient and informative article that steps way outside the normal blog / news echo chamber you find out there. It's incredibly refreshing, actually. It's largely centered around chain.com but it's relevant beyond them.
It acknowledges the stigmas that Bitcoin has but also quite elegantly outlines the potential beyond them, almost to the point of refuting them without doing it overtly.
While a bit of a read, I feel like this is a good one to share with people as a primer to answer the "what's this bitcoin thing about?" question.
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:36:11
I say basically the same but I've found that last part about not requiring a trusted third party to be lost on most people. They don't see anything wrong with that piece in the current system. They don't care.
The closest I'm able to get is that most of the time they have to create accounts everywhere they want to order something online and then provide their payment details for the company to pull funds. And once they have those payment details, they can pull again, sometimes without permission. They also have to trust that this entity is keeping their payment info safe from identity theft and credit card fraud. This begins to resonate with some people but most haven't experienced any negative effects of this failing aside from having to get a new card issued at some point or another.
Using bitcoin is sort of like the entity you're paying giving you their account info, but an account just for you or even for just that transaction. I think people are slowly realizing the value and sensitivity of their own data / info and are becoming more cautious when considering sharing it. But I think it's going to take time and people being burnt, unfortunately.

It's not just about identity - it's about convenience (and likely email verification). The reason many sites request someone verify email at account creation is to prevent spam request for accounts. When I can purchase without having to even create an account, it's more convenient for me and reduces the spam email I have to potentially deal with in the other direction.
I realize there are temporary email addresses for this type of thing but it's just unnecessary bullshit to deal with. All they should care about is whether payment was made - especially when we are talking about digital downloads. For physical goods, it's obviously different since you have to provide your physical address.

I like copay, Greenaddress, and Ninki (alphabetical order). They have different functionality though. I'll probably write some reviews and how-to's. But give them a look.

This is really interesting and I don't think it's any coincidence who they chose as partners. As I have said myself many times (and have seen echoed here from others), people will end up using bitcoin without realizing they're using it.
What is Facebook's stated goal? 


A lot of people know that already. What many people aren't aware of is a parallel initiative that Facebook has: Internet.org. While facebook means to connect the world, there is still roughly 2/3 of the world that is without Internet. From the [Internet.org website](


So as much as people love to hate on Facebook, let's assume they stick to their objectives.
* Give the people power to share
* Make the world more open
* Make the world more connected
* Bring Internet to the parts of the world that are without it
In order to do these things, exchange of value is going to be a very important element to the whole thing. I think these goals are all in line with the spirit and capability of bitcoin and again, I don't think it's any coincidence who they ended up partnering with.
I encourage you to have a look at the internet.org projects and general information and I think you will start to see the philosophy they have.

Electronic Mail is a term that’s been bandied about data processing circles for years.
Simply put, it means high-speed information transportation.
One of the most advanced methods is terminals talking to one another.
Your mailbox is the terminal on your desk. Punch a key and today’s correspondence and messages are displayed instantly.
Need to notify people immediately of a fast-breaking development? Have your messages delivered to their terminal mailboxes electronically across the hall or around the world.
Electronic Mail is document distribution that’s more timely, accurate, and flexible than traditional methods.
There’s no mountain of paperwork.
Administrative personnel are more effective.
Managers have access to more up-to-date information.
Decision-making is easier.
Tomorrow’s automated office will clearly include Electronic Mail. But like the rest of the Office of the future, it’s available at Honeywell today.
For more information call Mr. Laurie Reeves at (800)-225-3222/3 (within the 617 area, call 552-2048). Or write him at Honeywell Office Automation Systems, Three Newton Executive Park Drive, Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts 02162.

Given Apple's recent stance on privacy and encryption, I think longer term Bitcoin could actually mesh with their services. I think one thing is pretty certain though - if they do use Bitcoin it will happen (and work) without anyone really knowing they are using it. It will be used as rails for p2p exchange rather than blatantly endorsing BTC.
Before that happens though something serious needs to happen with the block size limit - unless they process off-chain transactions and settle on-chain.

Ah, I see. Interesting. I misunderstood. I don't believe that exists but I don't suppose it would be terribly difficult to implement. I think it would need to be facilitated with a third party managed multisig wallet like a combination of copay and greenaddress - where the 3rd party acts as one of the signatures. Greenaddress is 2 of 3 or 2 of 2 currently.   
This is a good suggestion though. I can see this use case being fairly widespread.

I have been very happy with the functionality of GreenAddress. There are mobile apps for iOS / Android as well as a chrome app (not sure if you classify that as a desktop app or not).
It allows for 2/2 multisig (with greenaddress being one of the 2 and also a utility to use to transfer your funds if they ever go down) or 2/3 using basically 2 of your own seeds (hd wallets) and greenaddress as the 3rd.
What this doesn't support, however, is setting up more complex multisig wallets (true m of n where you define both m and n). I honestly don't know if electrum 2 or Copay allow for this.

I agree and came to that same conclusion. The only thing that gave me pause, however, was Gavin. He was involved from the beginning, did so much work, and never really seemed like he would succumb to hubris. All his blog posts, especially during the height of the scaling debate pre-segwit, seemed insightful and grounded. So when he ended up in the BCH camp I was very conflicted and tried to see what I was missing.
Ultimately, I concluded that the approach BTC was taking seemed to make more sense and building additional layers was more likely to scale successfully than on-chain in the long run. Also, I was completely soured by the immaturity and unprofessionalism of Ver, Wright, and the community as a whole. Taking the moral high ground usually prevails in the end. I never was able to reconcile how Gavin ended up in that camp but I chalked it up to just misreading things at some point.

Agh! Stuck on the name. :(
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:44:45
1. You are given the photo and the cryptobin. You can see a faint image superimposed on the Bitcoin image. I played with the curves in Photoshop a little. Incidentally, I could tell that it was something space-related based on the starburst in the bottom left. I originally thought it was Fabian's age so I was thinking of the earth. Then I finally searched for something along the lines of "space 35 years" and found the image of the [Voyager Golden Record]( (the key to the first Cryptobin). (**Hint: Murmurs of Earth** would give you this answer if you were still stuck).
1. In that Cryptobin was "In 40.000 years, the goldenrecord.org will be found and a message will be send back through time by a friend from another world. Only those who know his name will be granted access to the next dimension" and another Cryptobin. Voyager 1 is due to pass within 1.6 light years of the star Gliese 445 in roughly 40,000 years. I did some digging on goldenrecord.org. Originally I was clicking through and happened to end up at the comments section where the Disqus plugin was but it didn't come up and I thought it timed out for me. It gave me an error so I just went back elsewhere. Then I thought it was talking about the U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, Carl Sagan, Jimmy Carter, or something else in audio format on the record. None of those worked so I started banging my head on derivations of those names. I mulled over the hints a bit more, wondering which would fit. The comments I saw earlier resided at "Earth" (with the earth background and to get to them you have to click on Earth) and thought the **hint: Find Earth** might fit. Turns out that the Ghostery plugin doesn't like Disqus and it was the reason it wasn't working. I turned it off temporarily and read through the comments. I scrolled to the end looking for something obvious related to pioneers or some suggestion on the names I was trying earlier (the real people) and saw nothing that stood out. Beremat actually helped put me back on track and look again at what I had already dismissed. If you look at the comments, there's one from Glieserian, and that's the password for that Cryptobin.
1. That gives you this image:  and another cryptobin. I immediately recognized them as Wingdings (**hint: Wings**) font and proceeded to decode the message at the top. "Welcome to the city of gold". I did an image search for city of gold and actually found a writeup about the end of gold with that exact image as the article header so I was going down that path for a bit but nothing jumped out so I stepped back. Then I wiki'd city of gold. Johannesburg is the city with the biggest gold exchange - that wasn't it. Then I tried El Dorado, which opened that cryptobin. (Also, **hint: It is golden**).
1. This one actually made me laugh audibly. It said "Glieserian: I have shown you my world but we will have to part ways my friend. Glieserian: I will answer one question about the future, make it worthy. You: If Earth still exists in 40.000 years, what would be the main currency?" I figured "It can't be that easy, can it?" Entered "Bitcoin" and ... yeah, that opened that Cryptobin.
1. The contents of that were "You: Really? Glieserian: It is true. Take this key part as proof: &lt;first half of private key&gt;. You will require knowledge of what is behind this door to go back home." I stared at that for a little while, did some googling, and went back. We have a door. I can't get through it. I need the key. For shits and giggles I took the private key as the password to the cryptobin, and it worked. (~~I assume this is where the hint "we are both" comes in~~ Nope, that related to the following step so I guess it was a lucky guess based on "key part").
1. That lead to a statement "We don't have time" and a cryptobin link. That's where several others were stuck. The tendency here is to assume it's a continuation of the conversation with Gliserian but it was separate. It was a riddle unrelated to the previous. What doesn't have (or experience) time? Photons. This unlocked the cryptobin and revealed the 2nd part of the key.
Then I fucked around for almost 10 minutes trying to get Blockchain.info to actually allow me to transfer the damn money (all the while the clock was ticking for someone else to figure it out or another hint to come up). I imported the private key successfully but whenever I went to do the custom transaction with that address as the sending address, and clicked "review transaction" it just sat there and did nothing. I finally got it to work though and transferred it out to another wallet I have elsewhere.
This one was fun as I have been fascinated with space travel, astronomy, and other related things since I was a kid. I wanted to be an Astronaut ever since I was like 4 or 5, so my mother tells me. Unfortunately my vision wasn't good enough when I was at the point in my life where I would have to go to flight school to go down that path so I went a different route (I did go to Space Camp when I was like 9 though). I'm a little disappointed with myself for not knowing what the Voyager golden record looked like.
One final thought: building the last one definitely helped my perspective when looking at clues and thinking about their possible meanings. I recommend, if you have time, to just try to put something together as a learning exercise. It was a hell of a lot more work than I initially thought it was going to be and gave me a new respect for Fabian's work.

Most likely the ridiculously large number of out-of-state cash deposits and account withdrawals to fund people cashing out. The in-person deposits tie up tellers and therefore cause overhead to BoA. There was probably some clause at account opening that gave them the ability to drop the hammer in scenarios such as this. They couldn't close the account but they could hamstring bf enough to make it a headache and not worth continuing. Bf was likely considered a "bad customer" due to overhead costs.

Actually, I think there's utility in both spending BTC and also cashing out. Cashing out means selling and distributing that to the rest of the market. Now assuming the market doesn't completely implode, it spreads the wealth.
Now some will walk and not look back but I think enough people cashing out these days are the geeks that backed it as a concept in the first place. This puts wealth in the hands of nerds / geeks, and I think that's a powerful thing. If I amassed a fortune, I'd use some of the fiat money I cashed out to buy goods/services not yet available via BTC to improve and bolster the technology (or at this point the idea) that got me to that point in the first place.
I don't know who said it on here but I think a good analogy is the hypothetical of "what if you could have invested in the concept of email?" At first, very few people had systems / interfaces to make it easy. The geeks perpetuated it, simplified it, and ultimately furthered it as a technology just because it was cool and convenient. The implications of this are potentially much more impactful. I don't think you can ignore that.

What you're saying then is that the vultures are circling? I suppose it's good to have our ducks in a row but I don't know that I want this to turn into a legal battle with Bitfloor. I'd almost wonder if it would be more suitable for us to get in legal discussions with the bank rather than Bitfloor (don't lynch me yet). If they have pressure from multiple people, it would be in their best interest to expedite (lest they incur additional legal fees from more suits).
I don't know ... just trying to think a little outside the box in the interest of getting this settled. As frustrated as I am (and maybe I'm ignorant here) but I'm willing to give Roman the benefit of the doubt - at least for now. I don't think there was anything about this that was malicious or premeditated. He was likely making a lot more money from the exchange than he would even keeping the current amount anyway.

I believe in the concept. I despise the fees that CC companies charge merchants for sales to use their networks. I've been using debit as much as I can lately (which is ACH and therefore doesn't levy the CC fees). This is fine for local sales but the remote purchase market has a gap.
I thought Dwolla would be the solution and was originally quite in favor of it but the few times I tried to use it, it was still way too onerous.
BTC may be the solution or it may be a stepping stone to the solution. Impossible to say of course.
I think the people who say "it's either going to be worth a LOT or zero" are probably right but my bet is on "a lot" - both in fiat value but also in just plain utility and convenience. We're not betting on a commodity so much as a technology. I've been in this boat before, kicking myself later for not getting behind a great service or idea - Google, Apple, Netflix, Equinix, etc... I believe the technology will prevail. Sure, I'm speculating some but I want the technology. I think it has legs.
What finally got me to pay attention and buy into bitcoin was a scenario where my friend needed to send me money from a few hundred miles away. His bank wasn't near me and mine wasn't near him. We both discounted PayPal due to their questionable policies, freezing accounts, and just reversing transactions at seemingly a whim, leaving eBay sellers / buyers out in the rain. Dwolla was a maybe but when you actually go to use it, transactions take days.  We decided to just have him send me a check. Afterwards I finally said "this is bullshit" and looked into the state of bitcoin.
For math (or science), let's pretend the market cap is 10% the value of the USD. This may be a ridiculously high number but given its ability to work globally, I don't think it's unreasonable. Now last I checked, there were roughly $1.13 trillion USD in circulation. Lets make the math easy and call it an even trillion. 10% of that is $100bn. If all 20 million BTC are in circulation, that makes the price $5,000 / BTC (or $5 / mBTC). That may not be the right way to look at it though. The 10% may be a grossly over-optimistic assumption. [**This article**]( provides another interesting perspective though. It says that online shopping in 2012 amounted to $256bn (in just the US). More than a third of that was air travel, but retail shopping websites amounted to 186.2bn. (That really is a fascinating and relevant article / blog post). Think of the credit card fees these merchants have paid. It's silly. Amazon alone - imagine their potential reduction in operating costs if they cut out CC fees.

I took the liberty of transcribing the dark, hard-to-read article:
**Bitcoin Puzzle: Prices Vary Widely on Exchanges**
One bitcoin is now worth more than $1,100. Or is it?
The answer depends on where you look.
While the virtual-currency craze has sent bitcoin prices to record highs, the development of new trading exchanges has made it confusing for enthusiasts to identify the current price.
One bitcoin exchange, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, on Thursday showed a price of $1,172, up from less than $14 at the beginning of the year. But a mother, Slovenia-based Bitstamp, showed a price of $1,039. The CoinDesk index of three exchanges - Bitstamp, Mt. Gox and Bulgaria-based BTC-e - was at roughly $1,048.
The differences among the exchanges reflect the scattered nature of bitcoin trading, say people who track the activity. Erratic volumes and technical issues are creating big price swings, and sometimes wildly uneven prices across trading marts.
That could begin to ease a bit. Prior to Thursday, CoinDesk only used Bitstamp and BTC-e prices in its calculations, but has begun using numbers from Mt. Gox as well.
People who track bitcoin prices say the more comprehensive index will provide a truer representation of the currency’s value.
Bitcoin, the most popular of a quickly expanding roster of virtual currencies, ahs attracted enormous attention in recent months from venture capitalists, computer developers, and merchants who see it as an alternative to traditional payments. The currency, launched in 2009, isn’t backed by a central bank and is created through a complicated computing process called mining.
Bitcoin prices have been on a roller-coaster ride through much of the year but have soared in recent weeks, reflecting growing interest from China and following a pair of congressional hearings that examined the trend, according to people who watch the fledgling industry.
Many bitcoin participants initially considered Mt. Gox as the pricing standard because it was the most popular exchange. But that has changed in recent months after it experienced numerous technical problems. Additionally, in June the company halted withdrawals in US dollars.
But London-based CoinDesk says Mt. Gox’s significant role in international trading should be reflected in the index.
“We think bitcoin is taking an increasing focus and we think Mt. Gox has international relevance,” says Jeremy Bonney, a CoinDesk product manager. The company runs a news and pricing website for virtual currencies.
Mr. Bonney estimates that Mt. Gox now represents about one quarter of all bitcoin trading, down from estimates earlier this year of about 80%. Representatives of Mt. Gox couldn’t be reached for comment.
Some enthusiasts feel most comfortable using CoinDesk index. For example, the Bitcoin Foundation, a bitcoin-industry trade group that pays employees and vendors in bitcoin, uses CoinDesk in its calculations, said a spokeswoman for the trade group.
Chuck Cohn, who runs a St. Louis-based tutoring company that accepts payment in bitcoin, says he considers the CoinDesk price to be a “gut check,” but also looks at prices on other exchanges.
“If I was buying bitcoin, I’d be willing to pay a bit more on a larger exchange for the peace of mind,” he says.
Still, he and other industry watchers believe that the price gap between the exchange will eventually narrow as trading becomes less volatile.

Same situation, same timeline, same feeling. Roman or someone else from bitfloor did say they were waiting on the bank to send the check for the remainder of the funds. That was on 4/20 and they said they anticipated 10 days which means 5 more days. =\ Meanwhile I keep seeing the price go up and my investment funds are locked down.
I was somewhat relieved to see, when I logged back into the bitfloor account, that the ACH transfer that was pending on the 18th (and then had "pending" removed after that) had 2 more entries after that. A credit of the same amount and then another transfer / disbursal after that.

Good try I guess. Next time try proper diction.
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:48:43
Right now there are 25 coins produced roughly every 10 minutes. Given a USD exchange rate of $100 / BTC that's $2500 every 10 minutes. Now of course some of this is done for speculation, hoping / expecting the value will increase but if you consider a fee of .0001 BTC, that's a penny per transaction (for easy math).
Next consider how many transactions would have to be completed every 10 minutes to equal the blocks generated and that is $2500 / .01 = 250,000 transactions to equal $2500 every 10 minutes. 
Next, according to **[these]( statistics:


From that you can calculate 10,000 * 60 * 10 = 6 million transactions every 10 minutes or 24 times the calculated number of transactions required to equal today's block reward. This doesn't even take into account the developing nations that don't even have credit / ACH infrastructure in place.

Maybe I'm seeing things but it seriously looks like someone is propping it up. Almost every time it approaches a psychological barrier, a large comparatively sudden buy eats the order book above the barrier. Momentum seems to carry to the next barrier or fib level and it seems to repeat.
I'm relatively new to trading but it seems to me that's not how psychology works. If you want to buy coins, you don't buy it up above a barrier like that - you wait for the bounces down and buy them up. It just seems really fishy to me.

I've been of the opinion that we should go with something better than milli or micro anything. BTC is cool and so are satoshis. I've thought, as a bit of a nod to both the algorithm behind BTC and the parallel to gold that "nonces" (similar to ounce) would be cool. Whether a nonce is a milli or micro I don't know but it would be better than fractional terms in my opinion.

I would include a scenario I went through recently where a friend needed to send me money. PayPal was out due to chargebacks and tie to ebay which is going downhill. Dwolla takes longer than mail. We didn't have the same banks so couldn't transfer that way. Neither of us had banks that were close to the other so that was out. It was at this point that I realized how asinine this whole scenario was. We ultimately said screw it and he mailed me a check. I felt dirty for living in the last century. Bitcoin (or other virtual currency) would have made this much simpler. It's trusting in the technology and its utility. There's a need and I believe it will take off.

I had the list of numbers initially with spaces but a simple google of any one of the numbers would give the answer and I thought that was too easy so I removed the spaces and thought someone would figure out that the 2 at the end may mean to parse a space after every 2nd decimal.

Not completely true.
* Litecoin uses the scrypt algorithm which is currently regarded as ASIC resistant.
* Primecoin tries to solve the "useful proof of work" point with chains of prime numbers (Cunningham chains). As yet no known GPU implementation that is anywhere near as efficient as CPU for this PoW.
* CopperLark uses SHA-3 (  )
* Peercoin (terrible name, "PP Coin", but a potentially good idea) implements a more-efficient proof-of-stake algorithm.
They all have "something different". Better? Maybe and maybe not but they're definitely not clones.

Think of it like storing the map and combination for the lock on a chest filled with coins. On the outside of that chest, it shows its contents but only the person with the key can teleport some of its contents to another persons chest.
You can create as many copies of the map and combination as you want and store them in different locations. As long as they're all the same, you can spend using any of those copies.

Amazon is in the business of selling to consumers. I think they'll join the boat and when they do, that will be a HUGE thing for BTC credibility. People who shop Amazon will see that they now accept this thing called a bitcoin and start asking what it is. It will increase awareness. Hell, maybe we could even create an online petition (or appeal to Wikipedia / Reddit) to try to convince Amazon to start accepting BTC.
I sort of compare the BTC now to how twitter was a few years ago. When I first started using Twitter, people were like "Why would anyone care about what you have to say in 140 characters?" Now every company uses it and it has amazing utility.
We're early adopters even if you're buying now, in my opinion.
Also, I'm not convinced Paypal won't start accepting BTC either, though I think they'll do it after Amazon. eBay is a technologically progressive company, even though I personally hate it. They could still figure out how to get their cut of the transactions even if they do take BTC. Someone else on here proposed a scenario that would work for eBay / Paypal, I just can't echo it eloquently enough.

Bitpay or Coinbase seem to be the current defacto standards for this right now. They will both help you set up merchant accounts and you don't have to handle btc at all if you don't want to. It's in their best interest to get more merchants on board, hence coinbase's fee incentives.

I think the most important thing to keep in mind is employing proper backup techniques. Having seen exchanges get closed literally overnight, online wallets get hacked, and people forget passwords, it's important to make backups and backups of those backups.
Easiest way in my opinion is to get Armory, make an encrypted wallet with at least a digital backup and a printed paper wallet. Store them in a safe, safe deposit box, or other hardened location. If things go awry, you'll be glad you have the backup. And the paper backup will save you if you forget your password (of course if someone steals it, they'll also have your funds). Just be safe and try not to have a single point of failure.

Stop using guiminer. It sucks for nvidia cards. I'd recommend downloading cuda 5.0 and then searching for "cudaminer" or "cuda miner" (can't remember which). You won't recoup the money though. Best to find a radeon card on CL and recoup the money that way.
Good luck.

The truth is that nobody really knows. It could be a loss it may not. The equation is too complex to project. If you believe in the utility, invest in the technology however is most comfortable / interesting to you. Don't think a month down the road, think at least a year or two.
In my opinion, however you bolster BTC is a good decision. It may not really feel like it but we are still in the very early days. Have fun being a pioneer.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:33:12
Yes, that's obviously one of my strategies but to limit it to one storage strategy is pretty foolish. Plus, if I share the paper notes with friends, I'm in the same boat as not encrypting the file in the above scenarios. I don't want to have everything in the same place.

Litecoin: I said "regarded as" meaning that's the perception. I actually agree with you and think if LTC really takes off we'll see SoC or the first batch of scrypt ASICs.
Primecoin: "Potentially useful". The jury is still out but I think we can agree that the potential is better than nothing. BTC's momentum is greater though, for sure.
CopperLark: no counter argument there but as you said, it's different.
PP Coin: I think the name and marketing that CGB has may prove beneficial in the long run. 
The thing to keep in mind is that all alts are even more speculative than BTC - and that's saying something.

That seems hard to believe. Why, given the slim chance of discovering a coin, would you NOT pool?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:37:12
Yeah, I think this is true. The fact is that what we have to think about is the gradual spreading of the concept. We, on Reddit, are for the most part geeks / nerds. It took a while for a vast number of us to come around and grasp the concept (many are still coming around). It will take this community then sharing this cool technology with others (the concept) and I think the argument is compelling enough that more people will want to get their piece of innovation. The distribution will spread to more people globally such that investing $20 or $50 won't seem outrageous regardless of the market value. All you have to do is take a look at the growing volume of online transactions to see the potential here. At least I think so. That's why I'm in.

@_date: 2013-05-10 23:20:44
All correct (obviously, since he figured it out). Now let me explain some of the hints:
**Old ones needed saving; new ones don't care:** Refers to the first clue, i.e. screen savers. CRT's needed screen savers. LCD's [generally] don't.
**The Monster popular in 1994 knows the answer:** People sort of got this one. It was referring to the album Monster by R.E.M, specifically What's the Frequency Kenneth (suggesting Kenneth knows the frequency), hinting that the numbers were frequencies. The REadMe.txt is also somewhat of a double clue here. It hinted that the case of the contained password was a mix of lowercase and capitals as well as also hinting at R.E.M.
**The Gryllidae sound before year one:** Gryllidae are crickets, as people got. What's before year one? The answer is Year Zero. If you Google "Crickets Sound Year Zero" the answer isn't far down the list and should be fairly obvious once you see it. This hints at the spectrogram since the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero was a scavenger hunt of sorts, one clue of which was a spectrogram on the album (cricket sounds) that gave a phone number.
_Incidentally, I spent the most time on the damn mp3 trying to get it just right. I did throw quite a few red herrings in there hoping to spur on conversation about it. I did not expect the numbers and the notes to trip people up like they did. Sorry about that._ **☹**
**The body is the key where the Key is over water:** The body of water where the Key [Bridge] is = the password, i.e. Potomac River.
**39.624383, -77.252183:** The GPS coordinates to the birth place of Francis Scott Key. If, on the Google Maps page, you select the Wikipedia layer, it will show Terra Rubra and tell you it's the birth place of Francis Scott Key. Also, if you convert it to DMS format, the google search becomes slightly easier.
** A picture of the Francis Scott Key bridge and the Potomac River.    
__***Those were the original clues. Once people started getting stuck, Fabian suggested some more to help things move along...***__
**A popular track holds the answer:** Another hint about the specific track, What's the Frequency Kenneth, rather than just the album name.
**000.00 000.00 000.00:** The mask for the numbers showing that it's 2 decimal places.
**Windowlicker:** A [super obvious, perhaps too obvious] hint to go the spectrogram route.
**It comes after the turn:** As in the flop, turn, river in Texas Hold 'em.
**Make the shift with 266f:** When people were _still_ having trouble with the numbers, I posted this last hint. 266f is the unicode designation for the sharp music symbol. The shift meant to use the shift key for capital letters for the notes that were sharp.

Some questions.
* So the actual conversation (first clue) was a red herring and inconsequential? I noticed the time, thought it may have some significance (nice touch using KDDI - I didn't connect that to Satoshi) but with only a time, I didn't really know where to go with just that. I'm just curious how you made the connection of the first clue to make the search you did. Like what did you query?
* I considered a brute force for the zip and did some searching. What do you use for brute forcing in windows? Everything I could find was payware or littered with ads and suspect to malware.
* What did clue 2 even mean?

I may be in the minority here but is it really that big of a deal to have algo trading? It happens all the time with all big exchanges. If you want big money in the currency, you're going to have to attract the big money guys. And big money guys like algo / HFT.
As an aside, it would be advisable to situate a hosted server or rack snuggled up to mtgox's colo equipment. Anyone know who hosts them? Equinix?  NTT? KDDI?
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:56:30
Problems at exchanges worry me somewhat but I don't see it as a deal breaker. It'll just make things more resilient. At least I think so. I am in no way an expert here. Just a geek who likes the model he sees.
As for how long I've been investing, the answer is "not long enough". I started just short of $100. I did some mining and even bought some probably about 18 months ago but I ditched it when it was making my office a million degrees and I didn't see it taking off as a concept. I abandoned the wallet with probably something like $10 in it at the time (I still cringe when I think about it). I didn't mean to abandon, I just stopped the mining, forgot about the wallet, and reformatted my machine without thinking about it. I know a lot more about it now and I'm back on board (with my wallets backed up now).
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:43:49
No I completely agree with you. I'm not saying they did it right or even that what they're doing now is acceptable. Rather, I'm just saying that they did acknowledge international wire transfers on twitter - so there's at least hope. Who knows within what time period though.

At current rates, sure. I started mining back in 2010 and stopped because it was a waste and not worth the power. I had like 10-15 bitcoins and just uninstalled because it wasn't "worth it". I'm kicking myself. If you believe in the technology and the concept, I say do it.
Sure, it's a speculative way to look at it but consider what you think they'll be worth down the line and the value / return from that angle.

Yes, that's obviously one of my strategies but I think it's a potential mistake to limit it to one storage strategy.

You take the money from the wallet then you explain how you reached the solution.
I'd be surprised, and somewhat disappointed, if you figured it out already.
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:10:39
Yeah, you could be right too. Knowing them, it was probably a misinformed assumption from something he heard or an intern told him. You know, without actual research on his part.

Don't forget that mtgox requires verified accounts for Dwolla-funded trades.


So the deluge of verifications *might* be a mass exodus, or at least some preparing in case they want to cash out bigger than they've been able to up until this point.

Having been in the scene for a while, there was only really one profitable venture so far - ASICMiner. Everything else would have been better to buy BTC and hold. Some are better than others but you basically need to have one of the first orders of a new run of turnkey boards for it to work out to your benefit. ActiveMining seems to be the only one these days that may have a chance (and it's a big "maybe").

Assuming the value doesn't go up. We may mine less per block because difficulty increases but over time value has scaled relatively in line with difficulty. GPUs may have a longer life than people give them credit for.

Seriously. It was the only thing that seemed to be operating seamlessly in the US for quick deposits. The other nice thing about it was that it would deposit $ rather than converting straight to BTC. Good for establishing your position knowingly rather than betting on what it would be in the future (e.g. coinbase).

It's a double edged sword though. If you "devalue" the base unit then when you compare it to other cryptos it suddenly gets lost and the uninformed don't see any differentiation of BTC compared to any of the others.
I've thought the psychological barrier needed a solution for a while but I just don't know what it is. Sadly, I'm not sure simply using mBTC is the answer. Incidentally, I'm not sure "bitdollars" is the answer either if we're assuming the USD is tainted.

Bullets 1 and 2 acknowledged. For the third bullet, that was *hint* number 2, not clue number two. Clue 2 was "key for what?" - presumably the following clue but it seemed sort of out of place. If you got ...
Never mind. *sigh*. I get it now. They're talking. He says "Give Gavin the key" and the next clue is "Key for what?" The answer to that is Alerts which was the password / key for the cryptobin. I feel daft...

What might make things even more interesting would be that for perhaps the first or 2nd clue, the verified payments for the clues would go to the current puzzle wallet and the later clues would go towards the next puzzle. It would have the potential of snowballing as more people got sucked in and also maybe even cause someone who solved it to hold off, hoping more people went for the hints but risk someone else pulling the trigger before them. It would also cause everyone who is watching the address to hear all the deposits ding, wondering every time if that was the one that cracked it and emptied the wallet.

I think the future utility should be pretty obvious to people. Just last week my buddy in Massachusetts needed to send me $400. Paypal was an option, though with the fees and both of our disillusionment with their shady practices in the past, it was a no-go just on principle. Then there was potentially Dwolla that promised "instant transfer from person to person just like cash". Yeah, until you realize that it takes 2-3 days to get money into Dwolla and then you wait again for the transfer to actually happen. At this point we realized it was just faster for him to send me a paper check. We're both considered geeks in our circles. If he had some BTC, I would have preferred he just send it to me that way. Hell, he would have paid less in fees within the BTC network than the price of the stamp he put on the envelope. This is why I see a future in BTC. It's just so damn much more convenient than any system we have now. Even handing cash from person to person. "Do you have change for a X?"

The text from the blog post:
Fidelity Investments is no longer allowing clients to invest in the virtual currency bitcoin through SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, a representative for Fidelity told MarketWatch on Thursday.
MarketWatch reported Wednesday that certain Fidelity clients could invest in the Bitcoin Investment Trust through their IRAs. That information was based on an interview with Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket. Read Wednesday’s post here.
On Thursday,  a Fidelity spokesman told MarketWatch that such investments are no longer allowed. The spokesman couldn’t confirm when or why the policy was changed.
“On an individual basis, we allowed an investor to invest in that Bitcoin Investment Trust,” said Rob Beauregard, director of public relations at Fidelity, in a telephone interview Thursday morning. “We are no longer allowing that.”
He continued: “We’re not commenting right now on why that was first allowed. There are reviews going on, and we’ll make a decision at a later date. At this time, it is not available on our retail platform.”
SecondMarket maintained Thursday that certain Fidelity clients can invest in bitcoin through the Bitcoin Investment Trust. “It is only accredited investors [who] have IRA accounts that are eligible to invest through Fidelity,” SecondMarket’s Silbert said in an email.
Fidelity’s website describes the company as the No. 1 provider of IRAs in the U.S. and one of the largest mutual-fund companies. Fidelity had $4.2 trillion in assets under administration as of Aug. 31, according to the firm’s website.

I bought an amount I won't disclose; here's why:
I believe in the concept. I despise the fees that CC companies charge merchants for sales to use their networks. I've been using debit as much as I can lately (which is ACH and therefore doesn't levy the CC fees). This is fine for local sales but the remote purchase market has a gap.
I thought Dwolla would be the solution and was originally quite in favor of it but the few times I tried to use it, it was still way too onerous.
BTC may be the solution or it may be a stepping stone to the solution. Impossible to say of course.
I think the people who say "it's either going to be worth a LOT or zero" are probably right but my bet is on "a lot" - both in fiat value but also in just plain utility and convenience. We're not betting on a commodity so much as a technology. I've been in this boat before, kicking myself later for not getting behind a great service or idea - Google, Apple, Netflix, Equinix, etc... I believe the technology will prevail. Sure, I'm speculating some but I want the technology. I think it has legs.
What finally got me to pay attention and buy into bitcoin was a scenario where my friend needed to send me money from a few hundred miles away. His bank wasn't near me and mine wasn't near him. We both discounted PayPal due to their questionable policies, freezing accounts, and just reversing transactions at seemingly a whim, leaving eBay sellers / buyers out in the rain. Dwolla was a maybe but when you actually go to use it, transactions take days.  We decided to just have him send me a check. Afterwards I finally said "this is bullshit" and looked into the state of bitcoin.
Finally, let's pretend the market cap is 10% the value of the USD. This may be a ridiculously high number but given its ability to work globally, I don't think it's unreasonable. Now last I checked, there were roughly $1.13 trillion USD in circulation. Lets make the math easy and call it an even trillion. 10% of that is $100bn. If all 20 million BTC are in circulation, that makes the price $5,000 / BTC (or $5 / mBTC). That may not be the right way to look at it though. The 10% may be a grossly over-optimistic assumption. [**This article**]( provides another interesting perspective though. It says that online shopping in 2012 amounted to $256bn (in just the US). More than a third of that was air travel, but retail shopping websites amounted to 186.2bn. (That really is a fascinating and relevant article / blog post). Think of the credit card fees these merchants have paid. It's silly. Amazon alone - imagine their potential reduction in operating costs if they cut out CC fees.
I've typed enough on my phone. :) My point here is that I see a lot more potential here than risk and I'm backing it.
