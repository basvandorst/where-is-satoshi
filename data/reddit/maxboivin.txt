A lot of my transaction are like that... If I transfer btc to my sister or my wife or a good friend and they don't intend on spending it any time soon we just agree to make it no fees.  It doesn't really matter if the transaction takes a day or two, they trust me, they know I sent it and it's still faster than mailing a check.

I like your explanation.  I haven't been really following this drama but what you're saying seems to concord with what I thought I understood.  Except for the third group.  I tended to be supporter of the third group but the idea of letting the market decide of the size of the blocks seems appealing to me... although, I don't know enough about this position to really evaluate the negative side of it.  I'll have to think a little more about this.

Wait... when you say "a full node" do you just mean bitcoin-core?  Is there only 5 000 people running bitcoin-core?  What the fuck does people run?
I used to run electrum but I decided to go back to core.  I didn't like the fact that the validation was done through a server, especially will all the talk of the possible fork and all, I wanted the security of having the full blockchain locally. 
Am I being crazy?  Is there something I misunderstood?

Humm... I don't tend to like middle of the road solutions.  
I like the idea that the block size are limited so people have to pay transaction fees and thus incentivise miners to keep mining even thought there would be no more bitcoin to mine but, from what I understand, different miners could decide the size of the block they want to process and what they want to include in it/how they prioritize their blocks and I like that freedom and decentralization and the idea of thrusting the people to be responsible.

Saying "three forty seven milliBitcoins (would probably be shortened to something like "milliBits or just milli)"  like in 3.47 mBTC.  Or may "three milliBits (here bit is used for bitcoin, a full one) and forty-seven, please"

The US healthcare system is not free market.  It's a mix system (with the worse of both world).  The hospital are private but the AMA has a state granted monopoly. 
Also, the state is heavily involved in the insurance business (even before "obamacare"), limiting competition (you can just open an insurance company and if you have a insurance company in a certain state you can't just offer insurance to someone in an other state... and more.)
The fact that most people in the state have health insurance through their job (which is bad since it make it more expensive to unemployed people and thigh people to job they don't like) is also due to the state.  During a world ward (on the top of my head I don't remember I or II) the government made it illegal for business to give raise to their employee.  Business had a hard time finding people to hire (so many of them were gone to the war) that they had to find something else to offer people so they would work for them so they started offering healthcare coverage.  
Also, don't forget that the US has the best healthcare system in the world (that's why the wealthy from everywhere go there when they have health issue).  The problem is that it's not accessible to the poorer people (and you can't just open a more affordable hospital).  
In a way, it's like if you had a country where the only care the government would allow it's people to buy would be a mercedes; much less people would have car.  Universal healthcare would be like forcing everybody to pay to buy a bunch of ladas (or hyundai accent), and leave those cars laying around with the keys on contact so, in theory, anybodies can use it if they need it. The problem is that often time, they're is gonna be no (functioning) car near where you are when you need it.

Well, to be honnest, it used to be easy to spot fake breasts but now, the plastic surgeon really got their shit together. 
And my specialty is in everything bio-mechanical.  I need to make sure that if a human being (or any animal for that matter) moves his body is deformed in a realistic way (or as realist as possible according to the budget).  
Boobs are a small part of what I do.  I concentrate more on skin,bones, muscles and fat (well, technically, boobs are fat...).  Also clothing but, that a different matter (ask me why cloth deformation look like shit in video game).
Because I spent a good amount of time looking at [doctor Paul Ekman]( work, I got good at spotting a fake facial expression.

I'm not sure how my age and education level is of any relevance.  I feel you're just trying to build an ad hominem here. 
So, yes, I do believe this.
Let's look at it this way: If I threaten you of violence, like I say give me some money or I'll abduct you and hold you I'm a cage in my basement where you're gonna be regularly raped, and you have good reason to believe I'll do it, wouldn't you be justified to use violence against me to protect yourself and your property?
Now if you don't believe so than I am the one who's sorry for you. 
DPR was in this exact same situation except that the blackmailer didn't threaten to abduct him himself (the coward) but to use an armed gang of criminals in blue costumes. And DPR did try to outsource his defense as well but, it was a defensive action. 
I believe the only way you can see it differently is if your judgment is clouded because the threat was to turn him over to "the authorities" and all those year of indoctrination you had in school make it so you can't see a threat of violence when you see one **if** it involves the cops.  Like if those people because, they have shinny badges or whatnot, they can throw you in a rape cage even though you didn't harm anybody and it's all good.

Isn't it why we have optional transaction fees?  (This is a serious question... I have been out of the loop for a while and I'm trying to catch up).  
The way I understood it was that if you have a transaction that need to be treated faster, you pay more fees.  If you don't care, you go feeless. At some point there is gonna be no more new bitcoins created to reward the miners but the miners are still gonna be needed and they'll need those fees to survive.  If we keep increasing the block size so that everybody can make it in the next block there is no direct incentive to pay any fees.  
Could you please explain me what I don't get and why I'm wrong?  Other than the argument of "not needing fees is better for adoption" (which appear to me as short sighted), is there something else?
Also, what I would like to see, client side, is when I make a transaction, if I can see the how much fees was paid on the transaction with the last fees paid that happen in the last block.  And a online tracker for that.  So, in the future, where block size is limited, you have an idea of how much you need to pay if you want your transaction to be processed in the next block.  Would that be feasible and/or practical? It's just an idea that poped into my head just right now.

I would quite interesting of hearing more of you point of view... which, I have to admit, seems quite weird to me.  
Do you think bitcoin will always be something marginal, complementary to central banks?  
Aren't you worried that bitcoin evade all governmental control?  (Sorry if I'm painting you with a too wide statist brush here :p )
Do you think "profit" made on bitcoin should be taxed?

I thought it would crash way earlier than that so, take everything I say with a grain of salt but, I do think the USD is gonna crash but this is not it right now.  If you compare to the price of other currency, gold and consumption good the USD hasn't lost that much value.  
I have put my buying on hold for right now... I'm not selling either (but I sold some sooner... way to soon in fact).  I don't think the price rising a buck a day is sustainable.  It might be a prisoner dilemma kind of thing.

Oh... While he was living in central america he was gathering herbs and plant in the jungle and trying to find new chemical that could be useful in medicine thus he had a lab in his house and there was some rumors that he was actually making drugs.  There was even a weird story as to how he invented bath salts and all sort of crazy things (but may be he was the one at the roots of those rumors with his weird sense of humor).

I'm still expecting a crash... down to 127$ than stabilize around 160$...  the price rose dramatically quick in the last two weeks (something like 10$/day... that's crazy!) but hey, don't take my words for it, I tend to be quite wrong when it come to price speculation of bitcoin (yet, I have manage to do quite well... just not as good as I could have).

I won't argue  with you on the whole taxation and public service in this forum... I'm a voluntarist so, I'm against all coercion, no matter if I like the outcome or not.  But you're welcome in if you want to discuss ;)
I just wanted to clarify on what I was meaning by "should "profit" made on bitcoin should be taxed?"... let's say you buy a thousand bitcoin at the beginning of the year... and they're worth 10$ each... if at the end of the year they're sell them at 50$ each, should you pay capital gain tax? (I'm  not sure if those exist in the US, I'm not an american).  What if you just hold them? Should you have to declare them as asset?

This was meant as a joke.   It's true that I hate this guy but his endorsement of bitcoin doesn't really impact my sentiment toward bitcoin... or him.

My bet would be that it will crash arond 131$, as for the high, I was envisioning it lower than you, may around 437$.

It's just surprising to see Keynesian or socialist/communist (and I don't to stick label to anyone here) jumping on the bitcoin train.  Central bank (and planning) are usually quite central to their ideology.  Bitcoin would seem to be a better fit for people of the Austrian economic tradition.

I guess it depends how you define "good moral  standards".  For some people, borrowing money and then saying "fuck you, we're not gonna repay you" is not good moral standard but theft.
Now, of course, those loans shouldn't have been made in the first place but, that's a different discussion.

I'm not suggesting anyone to sell or buy or wait for a certain price or anything... You won't get me giving any advice in such a volatile and experimental market.  I'm just saying that I'm not comfortable with this rapid price rise and I think I'll just wait and see what happens (I'm not gonna try to ride this wave).
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:49:35
I wish you would have gone with BTCTip instead of BCTip since BTC is the usual abbreviation for bitcoin... and especially since they're is another T right after the BC... this is confusing IHMO.  If this is the first contact some people have with bitcoin they might think BC is the correct abbreviation or worse, start using BCT instead of BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:57:51
Well... I would actually prefer if it would not got that high.  Bubble are not cool.  Yes, you can make some profit if you can ride the wave but it doesn't send a good trusty vibe to newbies and out-lookers.

I think this rise is way too fast!  I feel it's gonna crash just before 20. 
I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of people are anxiously looking at the price rise, trying to make as much profit as possible but not wanting to get screwed.  
Some of them will think that some others folks will feel 20 will be the time to sell (because of the psychological effect and all), and they know that when some folks are gonna sell it's gonna stop the progression and other people will see that has "the coming of the crash". 
So, those folks will sell just under 20, the price is gonna plateau, people will think the bubble is about to pop, they gonna rush in to sell, that will make the price fall down a little more and make a lot more people rush in to sell... effectively popping the bubble.  It's kind of a "prisoner dilemma" thing... 
This is just my opinion, I'm probably wrong but, just in case I'm right, I'll have something to prove that I called it :p
