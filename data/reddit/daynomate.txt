Yeh..nah.. so you're basically saying "We're sorry - here's some money to make up for it, but now we're just going to keep using your image since we've paid for it right?"

How does running a wallet like bitcoinqt differ from actually "mining" bitcoin? Is it a case of the wallet just having a copy of the blockchain but only the miner will do the verifications?

Would there be any benefit to creditors to hire a bounty hunter and have Mark brought to the US?

A threat with what chance of being enforced? He's a French national in Japan no?

That's interesting to hear and also mirrors comments from Cameron Winklevoss, however I wonder about the significance of first-to-market in the case of crypto-coins. Isn't it true that much of the effort to gear your business to bitcoins also covers the majority of what it would take to use other coins instead? My point being that isn't it going to be fairly trivial to change to or additionally work with altcoins? I guess the big thing is the volatility of those other coins.

There are issues with Randall's theory. There's a great (and very long) Ars article about it and what weaknesses even very long passwords have if they're regular common words. Their conclusion - the only password you should have is long string of random characters that is not commonly used.

They already have: the people selling their btc on gox instead of holding on are "realising" their loss that could have just been temporary till the situation rights itself. However some people don't have the luxury of time I guess.

wtf.. demonoid is back!?

Do we have reliable sources to confirm it? I can't find any yet. The actual organisation that was apparently making the ruling hasn't announced it themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:05:57
Whether it originated that way or not is in my opinion irrelevant. 
Language is defined by it's use. The phrase "breaking news" is now accepted by, I'm guessing here, a majority of native English speakers in "the West" to be fairly common: that the speaker is announcing something newsworthy for what they think is the first time to that audience.

Multi-signature or at least locking the withdrawal address should be mandatory

How is buying LTC diversifying from BTC? Show me where the BTC:LTC price ratio has been anything other than relatively static

not true. both "dice" and "ware" will be common strings in hash tables. it doesn't have to be a real word it just has to be something that will be common use and therefore in a toolkit of a hacker
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:33:44
O right, lel :p

Sell and buy side typically have a gap... seller wants more, buyer wants it for less.. one of them has to budge. In this case the seller is faced with a looming deadline of April 14, and the assumption that plenty of other people do too so the price is going to fall. The buyers don't have this pressure so that's why I think you'll see sharp drops as the sellers panic
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:32:25
They still exist??
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:21:28
Look for price-sensitive news. The biggest right now is the rumour that China will not allow exchanges to take BTC from April 14 and what looks like a panic-sell response.

HELP REDDIT!! Seriously... is there anything we as a community can do to investigate BTC-Arbs? It's clear now that it's a scam yet they're still managing to take people in. We need to do something for the good of bitcoin! Scams like this do damage to bitcoin overall

Excuse the naive question.. but to do this, wouldn't they need to essentially "mint" some new amount of that fiat currency without the physical notes/coins so that it balanced? And how would they create it without buying it? So would that mean it could never be an existing blockchain currency but would have to be a newly created one.

My work around is to have a blank column next to a column that contains some function calls, and move the column when I want to update. It then updates all function values from cryptofinance.

Not sure if it's a matter of perspective but rather just statistics. Volatility is measurable and can be compared between various financial instruments against each other. Zerohedge had a nice article recently that included volatility.

Actually they are quite clear. I'll find the link but they challenged several professionals to breaking various passwords and had good feedback from each of them  as to why they were so easy. They all agreed - passwords need to be made of long uncommon strings. Dictionary passwords are easy even when combined  
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:47:54
Absolutely. 
What's more the teacher MUST be shamed for this and used an example. She's completely missed the point of education.

Interesting product. However it worries me that they consider the xkcd comic about password strength as solid. There are numerous rebuttals to Randal's comic that explain how easy multiple common word passwords are to break with hash tables.

Why the down-votes? They're clearly not legit. You people are doing everyone a disservice by not keeping info of scammers available.
