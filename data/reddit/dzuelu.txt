So from just before the spike, a high of 18% and a low of maybe 12% averaging closer to the low spectrum. (Looking at data after the 18% spike 506555). After spike a low of 26% and a high of 35%. Using data from [segwit.party/charts]( Ok, their's a minor increase and it could have an impact on transaction fees, but I think that impact would be minor.


I can't find any solid info for this. Link it if ya got it.


You are right that the UTXO set has been consolidated. See [blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count]( Good thing they can afford to consolidate their transactions because their was high demand, up to 55% OF ALL UTXOs became unspendable because the fees outpriced the value of the utxo. [Source]( If you keep the "fee market", this will be the norm.


So nothing right now.


So also nothing right now.
All around if BTC had the transaction volume of December, the BTC chain would not be able to keep up and it would be the same situation.
