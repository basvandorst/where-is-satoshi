This shit makes me nervous. Government’s filthy mitts only lead to oppression.

The government bubble needs to burst - millions of people, and billions of hours of labor, all going to produce nothing of value.
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:23:59
Yup. The only regulations bitcoin needs were given to it when it was created. Government should have nothing to do with money.
@_date: 2019-06-07 00:18:07
Nothing is needed. Let people engage in peaceful activity and stfu.

That twitter clip was chilling. Congressman talking openly about using the dollar to enforce US hegemony, or as he puts it “project American values,” around the world.

I’m not saying I know, because I don’t, but Seth Rich makes more sense than the phantom of Russian hackers, which sounded like what a 60-year-old would say if they had 30 seconds to come up with an excuse for the leaks. But it actually turned out to be quite clever.
“How do we divert from the fact that these leaks are 100% accurate? I know, by calling it ‘meddling’ and ‘interfering’ in an election!” It’s pretty amazing when you can turn telling the truth about powerful politicians into an evil thing.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:50:37
How is that relevant?
This is how powerful the tribalism of R vs D is, even though there’s like a millimeter of difference between the two of them. People are okay with a political prisoner being skewered for telling the truth, just because their team lost.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:31:02
Original deleted, because I wanted to double check something.
Anyway, I don’t know what happened. Tbh I’m not sure about the phishing claim at all. I never saw anything myself, and to my knowledge Wikileaks never corroborated it (though maybe they did and I missed it). 
So I ask myself, who is more credible? The secret police who starts regime change wars, the embarrassed political party, the agenda-driven media, or the journalists that have never published anything false, against whom the state already has a vendetta?
This doesn’t amount to knowledge, but I’d say Assange/Wikileaks wins on credibility so far.

American democracy is two parties. Two groups of elites, who maintain only marginally different opinions, tossing the ball back n forth every couple years. I don’t get why people are so precious about it.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:24:17
Yeah. Just as there are a lot of Ds who now hate Assange because of R vs D, a lot of Rs who wanted him skewered now love him.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:38:05
Translation: I’m upset about the US election, despite the fact that everything Wikileaks released was true.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:45:55
You mean all that true stuff Wikileaks published?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:48:48
Sour grapes over the US election are powerful indeed.
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:59:14
I believe? No, look again. I have no beliefs about the matter. I do however think given the circumstances is easier to buy than Russian hackers, which has always sounded made up. But I have no beliefs. Any of it could be true/false, or the circumstances could be something else entirely.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:59:12
Everyone I know in the anarchist/libertarian community supports them all: Assange, Manning, Snowden, Cody Wilson, Ross Ulbricht - all people that challenged the state, and all punished for it.
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:14:17
I took that as the point.
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:21:06
Because any charges against someone that reveals government secrets are highly suspect. Obviously the state will be doing what it can to trump something up. It’s what they do. It doesn’t make it false, but it is very suspicious.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:00:58
Yeah that’s what I was looking for. I couldn’t recall if that came from the leaks or not.
So would someone like Seth Rich have been involved? I don’t know. Maybe he was just mugged, killed, and that was that. But as I said, his being involved makes more sense than Russian hackers. And if all the Russian conspiracy stuff is true? It seems they did a heroic thing by releasing accurate information to the Americans and the world, right?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:43:14
Like what?
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:17:03
How people are emotionally attached to one of the two parties of entrenched, ruling elites in a two party system is mystifying to me.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:44:37
What does it matter what someone is “about,” when everything Wikileaks ever published was true? Actions &gt; presumed motivation.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:07:06
This is the rub of having ethical problems with the state. So far my strategy of crippling poverty has rendered the tax question moot, but I'm not sure about it as a long term strategy.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:53:58
Tangential question, but does anyone actually pay the capital gains? Big companies I assume, but there can't be a high rate of individuals claiming right?
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:01:43
Noooo! Why would you waste all that money on college?! You had riches to invest baby!
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:05:31
Someone did. Or 2010 at least. Friend of mine asked me if I read any of his facebook posts about Bitcoin, and said “I think you’d be interested.” I did a little, but my head wasn’t in that space at the time and I didn’t really care. Also, he was addicted to meth, and I’m fairly certain that’s all he used it for. Sucks cuz he was mining back then, but pretty sure he has nothing to show for it :(
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:17:11
What a reprehensible douche. When the country began the government began its purpose was to defend liberty for the people. Now they speak openly of restricting liberty for the purpose of maintaining power over other nations. Pretty gross.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:47:46
We don't have an online storefront yet, because we're small enough such that we don't have that much inventory. Certainly that's something we hope to add as we grow though.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:43:28
Thanks everyone!
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:41:32
Yeah hah. I heard about that recently. Pretty interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:18:46
Any recommendations on the best one?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:40:00
I'm hoping so. I was motivated to look into it just because of my personal anarcho-capitalist view, which lend themselves to things like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:39:16
We sell bits and pieces online, but right now we don't make enough money to have an extensive online inventory. However, whenever we get more expensive magic singles or higher priced Heroclix or something we generally throw it up on ebay. You are definitely correct. Online is where it's at.

We use an ipad with square register for checkouts. Is coinbase android only?
