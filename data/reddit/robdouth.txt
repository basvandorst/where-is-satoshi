Canadians already have done that:
They have brought multiple cases and won to varying degrees. The Canadian parliament has also now enacted laws limiting the Canadian version of free speech somewhat in deference to Muslims. 
So... where are you going with this. It's already happening.

I agree with you. I think he's one of the few guys that due to his lack of being able to control himself will take metrics that would re-elect almost anyone and still not be able to do it.
I also think he may just "claim victory" and not run for re-election. that really wouldn't surprise me at all.

This statement contradicts itself. You said moral in context AND in all cases. 
If it's moral in all cases, then context doesn't matter at all by your own words.

I'm not arguing he hasn't done anything, and I remember the underestimation that led to his election. I think it was also an underestimation of how disliked Clinton was. If they field a moderately likable candidate, then I think it's a much different dynamic. 
I won't pretend to know what the outcomes will be. Reddit doesn't necessarily represent the mainstream view of most Americans so if you look at the front page, you'd assume he's heading for a landslide defeat, but with the economy humming and if taxes help boost that further, then he may be able to overcome his mouth and tweets potentially.  There's a good chance that he looses Congress in the process though.

You may be correct, but if the economy hums along, that seems to be the biggest determinant. He can mouth himself into losing it, but if the economy continues to grow and jobs continue to increase, he may well have to do something even more over the top than he has already to lose. Plus this also is without knowing who the Democrats will put against him in 2020.
