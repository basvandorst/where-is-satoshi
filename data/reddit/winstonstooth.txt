Thanks! OK I'll test it out today with a small transaction just to be safe. :)

your username is strangely appropriate for an oregon trail ref.

Thanks for taking the time to explain I appreciate it!
Yes, all about weighing the risk -
1/ I'm assuming my wallet seed is clean since it was Mac OS X and I don't download any unknown programs or apps.
2/ Want to stick with that seed to avoid the risk of forgetting a new one, which would be a guaranteed loss, whereas malware is a smaller but also real it seems risk.
3/ Want to be able to check in on my balance from time to time to see what's there and create new addresses.
For these needs, am I almost completely safe in deleting Electrum and those directory files containing the private keys and re-installing Electrum from my Master Public Key only? No paper copies of my seed and password exist but both are committed 100% to memory.

Had another question. The MPK is 'born' the same day as the wallet seed, correct? In other words, anything I am seeing in read-only with my MPK is by definition able to be restored by that original seed I memorized months ago? As a backup gave a paper copy to my son.
This cryptocurrency world is wild! Still getting used to it.

Great gesture. This Friday could be interesting!!

Another question (you're the most helpful person I've found on this sub!)
Earlier today I entered my wallet seed on a brand new computer (Mac) that had only briefly been connected to the Internet beforehand (to download the latest version of the Electrum client). So the seed was typed out, in the clear, possible to be screengrabbed or keylogged.
Then I realized this new computer had been exposed to a USB drive earlier in the day when I moved some family photos from my old computer to the new one. So it is technically possible for malware to have self-infected the USB drive and taken a screenshot of the seed or keylogged it.
Typing it out in the clear is a security risk, but given it was literally a new out of the box Mac, is the risk marginal enough to be dismissed? Memorizing a new seed would be a pain and a risk in of itself.

What is the exact function of the password feature within Electrum? Because I can send coins from it without it asking for my password. Is the password purely to keep the private keys encrypted?
Set up Electrum after downloading it offline so that no key logging or screenshot malware would be able to see the password I chose and the 12 word seed. But since then this computer has been online numerous times used to surf. Is this sufficiently safe or should I transfer the coins to a new computer that hasn't been online in a while?
*Thanks in advance !!*

You're the best!! Thanks again - says [watching only] now for my seedless one so looks like it is set up properly.
Didn't know there was a secure empty trash function. Used it as you suggested, I learn something new every hour on this sub

You mean it could alter Electrum so that the wallet seed generated is non-random and known in advance to someone? Then I'm out of luck lol. Thanks for the info- how likely is it that the seed is compromised? Newer install of Mac OS X.

time it takes to memorize a new seed, possibility of human error.

Thanks much. A paper copy is with a family member as well.
After seeing that the wallet was reconstructed from the seed properly, I deleted the wallet files using Secure Empty Trash as you suggested the other day.
Now there's no need to test it again. I assume the seed can regenerate your transactions as many times and on as many computers as necessary. Pretty cool.
Was at the bank today and the process of dealing with a slow teller who asked for my state-issued ID really drove home the fact that Bitcoin is more elegant than the banking system, and at least an order of magnitude more advanced. Made me excited to be learning about this stuff and using it.

certainly, thanks for responding.
Existing risks: the password protected wallet file may have been compromised, and the hacker could be trying to get into it with brute force password guessing. the wallet string generated by Electrum is 'only' 128 bit entropy and could be stumbled across by a GPU brute force guessing algo if not now, then in a few years when I've all but forgotten about my coins in long term storage. the wallet seed could have been compromised when I recreated my wallet on a new computer. Likelihood of any of these is low, but that's why I'm asking here, to see if my assessment is appropriate.
Proposed strategy: moving half or all onto Armory, creating paper backup, forgetting about it as long as the paper back up is secure in more than one location. keeping the cold storage laptop in case any unforeseen transactions need to be made in the future.
