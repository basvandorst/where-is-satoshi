Wow! That's terrible. Why does Google allow you to link to somewhere other than what the ad address and the status bar show? That's heinous!
You may also want to report this to [Google Ad Words]( as well.

Why does everyone always associate bitcoin with drugs and illicit activity. I can use USD to buy the same things, but nobody says the U.S. Dollar is only good for cocaine and meth.

I've had my eye on these honeys since I heard of Bitcoin.  There are other random auctions bitmit for small amounts too.
Edit: unless you meant you want to buy Bitcoin, then you could use coinbase. You can link a bank account and get coins using ACH.

Absolutely. PayPal and eBay lock, freeze, and close accounts that try to do *any* currency trading. I don't know if it's because I watch Bitcoin more closely or not, but they might take an even stronger stance against it compared with other currencies. It's a huge no-no none-the-less.


Seconded, if OP is in the USA anyway. One thing I'll say about Coinbase, though is that Bitcoin transfers out of my account seem to take longer (like 10 minutes), where they are nearly instant using my bitcoin-qt wallet. No idea why that is. Otherwise I'm extremely happy with them.

Wahoo! Good luck!

I stopped reading at that point. If using some alternative currency could let you escape taxes, nobody would use their country's own money.

When you update the Bitcoin Wallet, it will automatically send all of your coins back to you at a new address and then invalidate your old addresses. You might want to make a backup of your wallet now so just in case something happens when that transaction occurs you don't lose your money. Then backup again afterwards.
I got the beta update today and it did the transaction automatically and worked just fine.

Agreed. I've seen my friends computers and I wouldn't bring a wallet within 100ft of them.


Yeah. How many people have enough computing power to generate a block before the rest of the network so that their transaction gets wiped out? I'm sitting on an above average amount of compute power here and I know I can't. Now, granted, if you're selling more than a latte, you might want a few more confirmations. But 6 confirmations for groceries? You're saying you think some average Joe can generate 7 blocks before the entire rest of the network can generate the next block. Madness.

Yeah, I don't usually leave my Bitcoin at Coinbase. I only use them to buy my coins and then I immediately transfer them to my local wallet.

I'm curious to know what the difference in processing fees are for you. Everything I've seen says credit cards and PayPal are somewhere between 2.5% and 3.5% with a $0.30US transaction fee and Bitcoin is about 1%. Is that what you're seeing too? Are there any special cases (like reward cards) where credit card processors charge a lot more?

Yes, please! I use Windows Phone now and again and this is one of the things keeping me from using it more often. Also, when I don't use it, this would allow me to give my money to more people. Seriously, people! Take my money.
You too! Take some of my money...

They might not be able to shut down the network itself, but that doesn't mean they can't affect bitcoin. Governments can create laws that make it extremely difficult to convert your fiat from/to bitcoin. Places like Coinbase could be shut down. Businesses accepting bitcoin as payment could be fined or the owners jailed. Without those uses, bitcoin itself becomes less useful and thus less valuable, at least in those jurisdictions.
So maybe they can't affect bitcoin directly, but there are a number of services that directly affect bitcoin they can influence.
