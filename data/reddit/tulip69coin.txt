You mean that guy back from January, 21st?

i think that is very normal, we dropped 30-40 percent in 2017 too

I think i am right to say that we never saw a situation like that with bitcoin. 
That big pump to 14k resulting in a dump like now is really weird looking at the past. 
I think no one really knows what can happen right now it just is really weird. 
For real i was really positive about the performance but now i am more bearish (i not take any money in at this point nor take money out).
At this point anything could happen. (Personal bearish target at this poing is arround 5k, bullish is 10k i trend to think that it will get bearish cause it looked to good at 7500)
Correct me if i am wrong with my view of past performance

i am quite positive in the long run honestly and my targets are pretty high. Just trying to figure out what is happening and when i have to turn attention at the price again
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:00:41
maybe, i am to emotional for trading so i  just buy and never sell until my personal targets will be reached and even than i will not sell all my holdings

For real today i figured out that everyone in my working department knows that bitcoin is something that grows in value, despite that i never said something about it before there. Even today my colleague talked about btc first after we talked about gold for saving purpose *wtf* 
If more and more people see btc as the future gold  and may start to buy when they are confident enough we are facing really interesting times :)

dont be superior and dont be mad with them, instead teach them about moneterian system, this video right here explains it really well:   [

Would also buy a few of them at considerable price, if your not trolling which you probably doing, would give them to people when talking about bitcoin ;)

If your target from the start was to make 200 bucks than sell, if you want it to grow potentially more than hodl - simple as that
