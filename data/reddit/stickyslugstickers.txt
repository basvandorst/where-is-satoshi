I appreciate the knowledge in the tax region, I'm not overly concerned. Both fiat and crypto payments will be kept on file for tax season. This is a side business not my real job so at the moment this isn't much of a concern to me until more money from this business comes into play. And to do with privacy well if someone wants a physical item they sort of need to give up some personal info, (address). Until there is some platform that protects buyers from giving up their shipping information Im not really sure what to tell people. But I'm giving people the option to buy with crypto for convince and for adoption purposes. It's quite easy to send to another exchange wallet and send from there if people are worried about privacy of their wallet value.

Ill be doing my best to add what currencies I can via the checkout plugin, but i accept all crypto as payment. This can be done by messaging us through any of our social media sources and getting an order setup.

Thank you so much! I appreciate your feedback. Honestly I wish more people would give feedback like this, positive or negative. If it helps me determine what needs improvement or what people really want. Yeah building my own site was annoying and alot of work but I'm much happier that I went this route. I have nothing limiting me in the future and I also learned some Web design which is never a bad skill to know. :)

Thank you for your imput! I realize these payment gateways are semi risky in the terms of me receiving funds. But if there is proof of payment I dont mind covering the cost and sending the merchandise anyways. This is why i encourage my customers to keep the web purchases small and if they are looking for a bigger order to do that peer-peer to bypass any middleman issues. I agree its sort of a iffy time for this stuff but im trying my best to work with what we have offered to us.

Sorry I'm not quite sure what you mean what *method* could you explain? And it kinda depends, things are still early in my business so for now I'm just keeping crypto when I receive it and same with USD. I'm sure down the road I may need some of my crypto converted. Hopefully by then there will be a easier method of getting it out of the space.

I couldn't agree more, currently working on this option. It's difficult due to not many payment options available   yet. If anyone has Java script for this I would be very interested.
