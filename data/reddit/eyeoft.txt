Fundamentally, the system benefits. Miners provide the computational work that is cryptologically necessary to prevent forgery and double-spending. Think of this very much as mining, like mining gold - it takes special equipment, most people don't do it, and it acts to create the fundamental unit of exchange. The Average Joe can and should ignore it - the takeaway is that mining is a competitive, low-profit enterprise that keeps the system running.
Practically speaking, you do have to EARN Bitcoins in the same way you earn any other currency - do something of value to other and ask for Bitcoins in exchange. For example, *cough* sell something at  *cough*.
The currency you are used to is a fiat currency, it has no intrinsic value and is worth something solely because it is accepted as a medium of exchange. Bitcoins are precisely the same thing, except that they are free from centralized or arbitrary control by governments or other entities - instead you put your trust in an algorithm that is open to inspection by anyone with the interest and the expertise.

Thanks! That option will be coming in our next bugfix release, which should happen in the next couple of days. It will definitely make things a bit smoother.
As for categories, those will be included in the major overhaul. It's coming. Soon.

Put some up on Bitcoin Harbor! ( I will personally... um... be happy about it!
@_date: 2011-07-17 18:56:35
For registration and login, you're absolutely right. Will do.

Well, they certainly CAN be anonymous and untraceable if you use them in such a way as to make it so.

Hm. That's not a bad idea, we could have the user store their favorite currency as a preference. Though we do want to quote prices primarily in BTC - we're trying to help it develop as a currency, after all :-)

Bitcoin Harbor dev here. We've only been live about two weeks, and things do seem to be picking up. We're averaging about a sale a day now. I think (and hope) that it just takes more than a few weeks to really get on the community's radar as a good place to do business. We're planning to do a big PR push when we roll out categories, inventory, and a "look and feel" redesign, but that's a week or two away yet. If any one has any ideas on how we can get more publicity, I'm all ears!

Yeeeah, I think our VPS provider went down. Scared the living daylights out of me! Hopefully it won't happen again.

Aaaand somebody bought it!

In terms of tangible goods, hey, we're working on it -

Nice to see that Bitcoin is mature enough to have 'prophets' making predictions by consulting entrails, like all the other major markets.

Overhaul. Whoops.

Https is now enabled for the whole site. Your browser may complain about "some elements" not being encrypted - that refers to google ads and analytics. We may be ditching ads entirely when we revise the look and feel, still deciding on that. It should be entirely secure.
If we do remove the ads, I think we'll be taking your suggestion and making the entire site default to https in the next version :-) .

Go ahead and buy or sell something, please! We'll be re-launching with inventory, categories, and a new design in a few days.

Suggestion: Bitcoin has value only if it wins acceptance as a currency - the value of the Bitcoin will follow the HEALTH of the Bitcoin economy. If you're investing in them, consider helping your investment and the economy along: Next time you're going to buy something, buy some extra, non-investment Bitcoins and try to buy your stuff with those.

It's a possibility. Aside from login details, though, what data do you believe needs to be secured? It seems unlikely and rather useless for someone to packet-sniff to determine what items you've posted or bought.
I'm not dismissing the suggestion, mind. I'd just like to know what you think the advantages are.
@_date: 2011-07-17 04:34:20
Hmm, hadn't considered that. Certainly could do it. Are you thinking of this from the perspective of a seller, so that you would know how much exposure you're getting?
@_date: 2011-07-17 04:32:59
That's a good idea, thanks. We may make an area for that in the new layout. We have had a fair number of items sell, and so far all the sellers have delivered and everything has gone very smoothly. It WOULD be good to be able to make that clear somewhere on the main page.
