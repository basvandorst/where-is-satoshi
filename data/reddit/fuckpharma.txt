A lot of other “companies” add cool attributes to the space but are the coins actually useful or necessary? The realization investors had between 2017 and now. They might not even be vaporware, but why does their tech need a coin is  what I ask about almost every altcoin. Looks like the rest of the market figured it out too. Just because there’s good tech doesn’t mean the coin has value or will be used.  Btc eth and bnb. Solid for the future. Because the coins have the most use, network strong, etc. BTC domination will just keep increasing. Anyone still in alts are squeezing a blade in their hand harder as time goes by

He’s clearly talking about bitcoin in this comment, right? *wishfully ignorant about Trump’s ignorance*

There’s no way that there is a currency out there that’s proving to be more trustworthy and valuable than the dollar exponentially.  No WAY.  Can’t wait til TRUMP coin comes out, as much as u hate the guy there will always be 30% that refuse to dump their bags and can easily be pumped or FOMOd into second mortgage buying. Then second mortgage people that pull massive shorts because of their hate for him...... talk about volatility. Whoever writes a bot or algo that can buy trump coin based off his tweeting is gonna be a rich man (all hypothetical). I’m ready to start trump and dumping this altcoin in the future. Orange man bad, red candle SAD!
