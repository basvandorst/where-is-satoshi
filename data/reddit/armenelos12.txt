Yeah I have it memorized as another backup but I am not relying on it since I have other methods to get my bitcoin.

Yeah I agree with you. I would much rather people have to brute force than have it immediately. I would hope that if someone got half I would find out soon enough to use my memory to move to a new wallet.

I store half my recovery seed 12 of 24 words in a safety deposit box and a hardware wallet with a 9 digit pin. I have another hardware wallet at home with the same seed so I can check my memory of the seed and add and spend. The other 12 words are in a secret location and I have all the seed memorized and check it every couple weeks by inputting it into my hardware wallets “check your seed” feature.

They can easily acquire the contents of my safety deposit box and my other important documents at home and combine them. I am going to leave instructions. I’m not sure why the amount would change wether or not I would ask this?

Of those the one that seems most likely is that we both die at the same time. I do want to find a way to address that. House fire is taken care of with last pass if my wife lives. Also this makes me think about how much bitcoin could be worth overtime because you know people are going to keep dying without properly passing on their bitcoins. Sometimes I wonder if it could become unusable if the supply just continues to go lower and lower from lost coins.

I have had the same thoughts. I think any big jumps from halvening is just hype. The real growth from here has to be from acceptance as a currency or a store of value.

I guess that is a good point. They couldn't prove access to the wallet. I even have mine memorized. I recite it to myself all the time. Silently of course.

I think it is unreasonable to say that there is no scenario in which cryptocurrency could be seen as bad for the people. Overall I think it is much better, but gold was once outlawed in order to help get out of the great depression. It was done with the intent of helping people.

Is that crook hiding in my Trezor too?

I mean they could easily get records from exchanges prove that I have cryptocurrency and find or jail me if it was against the law. Could they stop cryptocurrency itself? No of course not.

I trade GBTC and haven’t run into any lock-in. I use interactive Brokers.

Is this any better than GBTC?

Yes I hate the premium and am really looking forward to an ETF without it.
