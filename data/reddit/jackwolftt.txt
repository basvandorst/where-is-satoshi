I have no problem with someone having a blackmailer or extorsionist killed, either by someone else or by their own hand. If someone threatened to extort / blackmail you what would you do?

I think if someone wants to play big boy games they should get big boy prizes. It is most definitely a violent position.

@_date: 2019-11-14 02:04:23
Truth of the matter the people you are referring to where the kind of human trash that deserve to be killed. They were blackmailers and extorsionists.
