Coinbase. I’m new to investing in crypto currency, is there one platform better than another? Which one do you recommend using? 
Currently Coinbase limits me to $5000 per week bank purchases and debit card $750 per week
And when using bank it takes 7 days to be active.
I thought this would change after the fork but I’m not sure if it’s Bitcoin that limits me or if it’s Coinbase and there may be a better platform I would be using.
Any help appreciated.

It appears that it was a glitch and is now working, it was very frustrating watching trades while I couldn’t, it seems to me if some can’t all shouldn’t.
I have done a little reading and I guess everyone here probably already know this but I will add it for those who don’t.
bitstamp | btce | bitfinex | kraken | coinbase | gemini | bitfinexbch     
appear to be all good platforms and trade similarly with many of the same limits and glitches.
I opened a Gemini account today, and if I’m doing my math correctly I should be able to trade at approximately the same level in each which would give me combined 7 times the amount I’m currently trading using just Coinbase.
Is there anything wrong with my understanding here?

How is it ok that Bitcoin suspends buy/sell stating maintenance, but while it is suspended there is still trading taking place, who decides who gets to trade and who doesn’t? Who do you even complain to that during this suspended time I lost 4K, how does this make any sense?
