Thanks for seeing the point I was making. I like crypto, and Bitcoin was always the one I advocated for, but I can't be in Bitcoin anymore if it's not even supposed to be used as a currency anymore.

I know what the merits of Bitcoin are, I was here quite early in the game and I was one of the people advocating for it at the beginning. But it's not doing what it's supposed to anymore, it's a stock with too many transactions happening at once. That's my problem. I still like crypto, and I find Ether to be pretty great, but I'm really sad that Bitcoin has lost its original purpose.

Is it really short-sighted if I say there's a problem with Bitcoin and get out while it's "ahead"? I mean, I'm pretty sure that's thinking long-term, especially since I still have other crypto currencies. I've been around Bitcoin for a long time, and without people's support, it would have died a long time ago. It's probably not a good idea to push people away.

Interesting, because you claim I wanted the transaction to clear quickly, but I stated in the post that I didn't care if it took a day + to clear. I just didn't expect it to take three days +. 
Also, I didn't use "too low of a fee". Every single calculator (seriously, I checked) said my transaction would definitely clear in less than a day with the fee I used. If 10 USD is too low of a fee for a 60 dollar transaction, it's a problem with the platform.

How about debit cards? It takes cash directly out of your account and is very difficult to charge back. Depending on how the merchant takes it it's also low fee. 3% is also quite a bit lower than Bitcoin fees are now anyway...

Yeah, and I don't use fiat either lol. I have been using Ether though, it seems pretty good so far. I used to love Bitcoin, and I'll probably come back when it's not taking three days to confirm a transaction. 
Edit: I'm an idiot. I was thinking fiat was another coin for some reason. Please ignore the above post. I'll keep it up to show my shame.

I think you didn't even bother to read the post.
