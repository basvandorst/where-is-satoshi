not as much as btc which is unfortunate. what about you...? you have any usd balance ? was it touched? I want more input on this because it does not make sense from they said 36% of everything.

whole haircut is not on btc.
 btc before 56.xx btc after 36.xx
usd not touched at all

lol who tf are you

I would think so because the USD value on my actual BFX account was untouched. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:10:32
yes i am verified us

Is it just me or is the 36% "haircut" being applied to only BTC balances? I just checked and my USD balance is untouched. My BTC balance is the ONLY thing that has taken a 36% "haircut".
Is it because synapsepay blocked bitfinex from accessing USD funds??? I got an email from them that told me such.

Apparently, you are correct. My USD balance shows up on BFX but it appears it was held by synapsepay. And yes, only my btc got turned into bfx tokens

 I was really looking forward to buying a good chunk BFX when it was annouced but I live in the damn US. well GG rip

No way to keeping anything on exchanges. After our issues with coinbase, Im not keeping anything significant on an exchange.

Alright Ill try out bitstamp first it looks like. I use armory atm because I find its cold storage and single key per wallet features appealing.
