I missed the whole thing. Back in the day forums I went on laughed at the "idiots burning GPUs and their moms electricity". I briefly read into it and just decided it wasn't worth it, after all bitcoin had no value.
Oh dear me, I missed the fucking boat on that one. The thing is though, as with all investments you can be upset over the last transaction, but you might as well get mad every time a lottery is drawn and you didn't pick those numbers. You'd need a crystal ball to know these things. Even those in the know, didn't know for sure, a little luck and some research got some people very rich.

I made £850ish profit in 9 days, buying around £8k and selling at £10-11k. This was with a £3200 investment as various points of buying and selling. I knew it was luck, I'm new and am learning as I go. This time after 3 days waiting after initial £11k drop I bought in a few times at the wrong moments, not just need to wait. Anything over £10k for me is profit on all purchases. 
Bought some books on crypto, trading and decision making that are recommended by crypto guides. I'm going to attempt to educate myself and actually get a real grip on trading, rather than relying on dumb luck.
Good luck out there buddy. We should get matching Lambos when all this is over lol.

I want to HODL but I keep buying the dips and selling the highs. I've only been in this a month. My goal is to HODL 1BTC very long term and short another 1BTC to keep reinvesting profits.
Obviously that requires money, and luck.

Rebought in even more at £8300, let's hope this bad lad at least clears 11k before dipping like last time.

Nothing is 'guaranteed', but I know what you mean...it will go above that point, at some point. I just don't know whether to seek around 11k like last time and had more cash to invest this time around. It looks like it's pulling back again from the set back. Maybe make some more money.

I know this is sound advice, but I will probably just hold at what I have and maybe sell when I'm happy with the increase. I rushed to get into the market after hearing that bitcoin "died off", I just checked it a few weeks ago and had seen it was making a recovery. I bought in around £7-8k with a few thousand and risked that, making a small profit through sheer luck. Since then I wanted to get more in the dip, but only to hold. In the meantime I want to keep my low priced coin, and educate myself on everything in the meantime.
I've found out I don't have the time, skill or realistically the ability to day trade or short this. I was just lucky after rushing into this. I have already learned a fair bit, but have a long way to go. I know the first rule of trading is never put in what you cannot afford to lose. Also that in the age of information, ignorance is a choice. I plan to wait this out and get clued up.

Look on the bright side, it's on sale again. My daily trading has stopped for nearly a week now since it stopped bouncing in a kind of predictable manner.

Will you get bitcoin cash from this retroactively?.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:22:33
I will not go

It's certainly scared the shit out of me.

I hope the prophecy is a whale who will make his own predictions happen to gain trust. The danger is following until the last prediction when he slams down and bulk sells to cash out.

Yes I'm seeing a definite downward triangle trend which could make it down to OH MY GOD ITS JUST BROKE SUPPORT AT 9K NEXT STOP 15K oh wait we're definitely noticing a pattern here so expecting to bottom out anytime soon maybe without any OH SHIT 10K TO THE MOON.

*Makes note to self*
There, I think I'm getting this.
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:22:02
I just bought at £8100 as well so I know what you mean.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:09:35
Ok what's going on this isn't funny. Buying more when my deposit clears.
