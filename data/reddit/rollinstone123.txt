Okay thanks.  So although bitcoin derives its value without something concrete backing it, it is not fiat money because its value is determined by only how much people are willing to pay rather than the government declaring its worth, right?

If I lose my phone I can't pay for anything anymore.

Right, the convenience factor is great.  However, I think that if this kind of technology is implemented, it will not be Bitcoin and will instead be spearheaded by major economic powers like the US, China, and EU, who will create a blockchain and have all possible coins mined then do basically an IPO at a set value (most likely based on USD) for people and companies to purchase. There will probably be incentives to adopt early and then eventually conventional currency will be phased out in favor of the new system.  And as is the nature of governments there will be just as much, if not more, regulation on this new currency.  There will also be issues with how to print bills that are associated with x value of currency, because let's face it, I don't want to have to pull out my phone to buy a pack of gum.
TL;DR: the convenience is great now, but if a bitcoin analog is going to be adopted as the primary currency it will be subject to the same frustrating regulations and transaction delays between countries that our national currency does today.  The government is not going to give up power over our money without a fight.

What people are willing to pay.  But that is how all money is valued.  I misunderstood what fiat money actually was when I posted the question.

Empowering the individual isn't in governments' interests.  It would be very easy to pull a China and ban the use of bitcoin under law.  Then global governments would have as long as they want to create a blockchain or they could simply change nothing.

I can call someone to come get me home.

Yes but I have my phone so I can call someone to get me home.  Having all your eggs in the same basket makes losing it more dangerous than losing a part of your important stuff, you know?

Governments are.
You knew what I meant.
