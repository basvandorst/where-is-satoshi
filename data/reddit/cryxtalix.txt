How about memorizing 2 words and adding one false word?

Don't worry. In a few years time, females will come looking to be held if you're a HODLer.

What? If I had his predictive abilities, I would have sold everything including my underwear.

May I also know where or how should I go about obtaining bitcoin if I want to keep myself anonymous? I really do not feel safe revealing all my personal identification documents to an exchange just to buy a few bitcoins, especially when companies that are known to possess lots of bitcoins seem likely to be targeted by hackers. I just do not feel the safest revealing my identification documents to anyone who is not the government.

If I fall into a 10 year coma and mainstream names of the fork coins start changing. While navigating my coins through all the forks, can I simply say that the bitcoin core will always be the one which makes decisions based on maximum decentralization?

So no farming, selling home grown vegetables, DIY handicrafts, home brewed beer, homemade food etc? What can you sell at all? I suppose people still do sell stuff under the table?

With how easy and common divorce is these days, you are just plain stupid to share 100% of your resources. 
Love and trust is nothing but idealistic beliefs. In reality, marriages fail alarmingly often. Come on, men are not idiots. While you are calling for men to "wise up", you are also advocating for men to be at the mercy of their (ex)wives and to go hungry whenever she wishes.

I'm just a student buying with what money I have. I will probably have a very thin wallet for some time if I bought the hardware wallet.
I need something that is cheap to use, preferably free. And secure. Convenience is not my priority, I can't pay several hundred dollars for a few minutes of convenience.
It's true, the amount I hold might not be attractive enough to get thieves interested, but it's significant enough for me that it will hurt if I lose it.

I need some understanding of this, not too tech savvy. So far I have used tails, but only to create the wallet while keeping the keys completely offline. I do enter the generated address into an online electrum watching wallet though.
When transfering my BTC, I enter the keys into an online version of electrum, send it all immediately, and ditch the wallet once the key has been typed into an online computer. Am i still susceptible to the man in middle attacks you mentioned?

People are still buying bitcoin. It's just that the huge crowd of people who just want to get rich quick, left.
In 2017, people though bitcoin was a get rich quick scheme. In 2018, people know bitcoin is just a decentralized currency. It's a pretty simple guess which one attracts more buyers.

I'm rather new to this bitcoin business. May i know how to get the latest information on the happenings?

I did not use coinbase, but is the "Bitcoin wallet" app on android good for storing bitcoins? I also prepared a paper wallet in case I need to move them off the app. I can set up bitcoin core on pc if i need to.
