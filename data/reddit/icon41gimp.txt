The only thing I dislike is that it fails to update sometimes.  I've seen it report Ethereum/Litecoin prices substantially lower than all other exchanges at some points, and my total portfolio chart sometimes just stops working for days.

It's not ready for micro transactions yet.  If you're using it to settle $25M payments though it is pretty fantastic compared to alternatives.

You don't pay a tax on each event.  You pay tax on your entire net short term and long term capital gains for the year.
"Taxable event" is just denoting that it needs to be included in the aggregate for the tax year.

You need to give a better explanation of why arbitrage won't occur.
Let's assume B &gt;&gt; 0, say F=20,000 and S=15,000.
At time 0, I borrow 15,000 (maybe I need some additional amount more to fund the future margin, relatively neglible) and buy the spot.  I agree to sell the future at time 1 for 20,000.
At time 1,  I receive (20,000 - S) for the futures payoff + S for selling the spot simultaneously - (15,000 + interest) on the loaned capital.  Total payoff = 5,000 - interest.
The act of selling the future and buying the spot will push the price of each toward the other.
What additional risk is left?  That I may need to fund additional margin if the spot increases significantly?  That seems like an awful small additional cost if B &gt;&gt; 0.

Maybe, just maybe a payment network secured by hundreds or thousands of exa-hashes per second worth of work is not the correct network to be transacting coffee.
It makes more sense that the highest security networks will be priced accordingly.

No this is wrong.  The measure used to see which LTCG bracket you fall into is adjusted gross income which includes all gains from sales of property.

It depends entirely on the type of exchange you want to be a medium for.  
If you want to displace the current medium for small microtransactions then your hurdle is very high because current fiat does well for that in most parts of the world.  Credit cards are super easy &amp; fast, provide you with unique benefits, offer security, etc.  
If you want to displace large, cross border, and settlement type payments then your hurdle is a lot lower.  Current ways to do this are pretty terrible for most people - slow, byzantine, expensive and often involve middlemen trying to take each their own cut.  Bitcoin in its current form blows this out of the water.
I don't see much value in the short term for being able to buy a donut with bitcoin where you are competing with other options that are highly effective.  Eat up the low hanging fruit while you develop optimal solutions for creating additional value in the future.

Financially there is no difference (except the risk entailed in holding crypto securely).  Any difference* between the prices of the Future and BTC will be arbitraged away - they will in essence become a single market.
*Future should generally trade slightly higher than BTC because there is generally more risk in securely holding BTC.

That's fair, but we've simply never witnessed money organically be created.  For new fiat currencies they're typically pegged to an existing currency for a long time before they're allowed to float.

If the futures price diverges too much from the spot price then you will be able to arbitrage the difference for zero risk (small counterparty risk of trusting the exchanges).  They will likely move in lockstep.

McMansion creep is due to the long term falling interest rates.  People (unfortunately) buy a monthly payment and not a nominal home value.  Rather than pocket the extra cash that lower interest rates have on their borrowing, individuals prefer to simply borrow more and pay the same total cost.

That's just false.  The card companies charge merchants who have to build those costs into prices.  You're paying for it whether it's on the receipt or not.

I don't think it's reasonable to blame what is happening in Venezuela on socialism anymore than it's reasonable to blame accounting standards for Enron.
I say this as someone who owns books by Hayek, etc. - I hold no beliefs that collectivist economics will ever work.  But this has been a straight up looting of the country by the Chavez-Maduro administrations, not a good faith effort to implement a different economic system.  I don't think you can make the case that a capitalist system would have fared any better under a government like this, without rule of law it gets ugly when the man in charge is a thug.

Short term capital gain is taxed at your income tax rate, but it still should be reported as a capital gain.
As long as the tax you pay is correct they probably won't get upset, but better you not give them something to contest at all.

There is no market in the developed world right now for making payments for everyday living expenses in digital currencies.  National currency works perfectly fine currently for that application.
It should be part of an ideal long term state, but there are not 300 million Americans clamoring for being able to pay for bread in bitcoin, there's not even 1,000.

This vector is like trying to get people to adopt the internet because they can now write Grandma using email instead of a traditional letter.
New uses that cannot be accomplished with national currencies will be the events that lead to adoption.  Not fucking bread and water.

It doesn't reduce risk.  You can achieve the same result by holding some portion in cash instead - longer DCA periods correspond to a higher cash proportion.  The only reason to DCA is because you're capital limited and need to use income every period to fund the purchase.

National currency is already easy to use and generally accepted (obviously) in the developed world.  You are not going to see adoption for this reason alone.
You need 1 of 2 things: 
The current system is so terrible that bitcoin is an obvious improvement (these circumstances exist in some poorly managed countries like Venezuela, parts of Africa, Greece, etc.)
Bitcoin allows users to do something that they cannot do with traditional currency.

You only pay tax on realized capital gains.  While it sits in your wallet any gains are unrealized.
