It's a good time to get a few more XRP while they are still cheap.
All in on anything is just asking for trouble though :-)

Care to explain yourself here? Of course Dogecoin benefits from the ground breaking work that Bitcoin has done to pave the way. This is something that most people on respect and are thankful for.
How you get to the greediest altcoin community of them all baffles me. If you are really involved with doge then you would know that this is not the case - there are many posts right now on asking to show some respect to the victims of Gox and seeing if we can't help in any way.

I have no doubts that plenty went on inside, and the pretty much all the theft can be explained by that.
Let's hope that the truth comes out - we all need this to happen!!
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:48:29


Could you be a bit more specific here? If you know something that we don't it could avoid another mess down the road.

The article is from one of Frances biggest newspapers in the language of the country of which he was convicted.
While "hacking" is possibly not the correct English term, it is the closest to the original French word from tje article.
Anyway, I'm sure that this will be translated pretty soon and you will be able to make an informed comment at that time.

The tipbot is running a bit slow due to high demand. It happens all the time, just be patient.
+5 doge

He created the dogetipbot ... hence his reluctance to include the tips sent to it and himself in the comparison.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:34:02
What's happening in 36 mins?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:39:21
Probably because if you take into account the tips going to and the tipbot, then it skews the figures. He gets tipped a lot because he created the tipbot, and quite fairly he is rewarded for this :-)
I believe that he did not take those tips into account so that we would have a fairer comparison in the tips that have been given out so far.

Thank you very much :-) What a nice surprise to start off my day!

Bitcoin didn't ruin anything. MtGox did.
Now, go play with your toys like a good little boy.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:26:55
I'm one of dogecoins biggest supporters, but please remember that without bitcoin, Doge would not exist.
Be nice please :-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:57:46
I came here to say how funny this is. 
I like both communities, so please don't let a few upset dandies get to you - we can all get on nicely if we want to :-)

It looks like it's back up again now! Good work by the guys at Kraken!
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:56:58
Amen brother!

To be fair, Litecoin has had a far bigger percentage gain than Bitcoin has over the past 6 months and it looks like it is just the beginning.
Might be better to sell some BTC for LTC and diversify. All your eggs in one basket is asking for trouble IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:38:55
Time to re-invest some of those BTC in some more Litecoin. 
Not that one is better than the other, but diversity is always a safe option.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:46:06
Many thanks. I just logged in to find that I'm still verified from 2014. All is good now, I shall never use Coinbase again!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:52:18
Join the club. Been waiting for about 16 days now. 
Looking for a good alternative in Europe, but I haven't found anything yet!
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:12:04
Me too... not happening untill I get my account verified and who knows when that will happen.....
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:53:08
Good point.... actually, this can only be a good thing long term. Bitcoin needed a bit of calm heads and this will give every one some time to chill out before things get crazy again.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:27:36
Good to hear that Kraken is still around. I used their services about 3 years ago, but I've been out of the game for a while now. Will have to see if my old login can be found :-)

Eth-ter is the real bombshell. Not yet, she's still awkward and growing up, but she's showing real promise for the next few years.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:22:16
The key words here are "Bitcoin can...." But it's not exactly poised to do so. A change like this would require mobile operators throughout the world to change their systems, not to mention the manufacturers.
So a cool possibility in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:59:09
Thank you, I will do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:25:35
How easy is it to move coins from Blockchain to your wallet.dat? I have both (with a very small quantity in Blockchain), but am thinking of moving it all to my wallet.dat.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:43:01
Thank you, I really need it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:17:00
Yes please :-)
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:15:35
So now it's official - Bitcoin is the Future!! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:33:14
Thank you. This is exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:41:21
Don't forget France! I'm up for it!!
