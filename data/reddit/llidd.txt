If the government "shut down" ...
Answered: How are Internet Service Providers and Cellular networks available in a crisis, and will crypto be available to facilitate mobile or nonmobile trading "off grid"?

Aren't they called sach?

I think if the government is shut down...
 Water filters, bullets and propane are going to be more of a currency than a digital asset that is currently mostly-nonfunctional and untradeable at the vast majority of public meaningful-vendors.

Could it be some one deposited to you accidentally? Look up you recurve address in the block chain/Google,  and check for transactions. 
(Noob guess, but could shed some light into your fair luck)

I want to do my construction trade in BTC. 
I want to be paid in BTC. 
 I want to spend BTC ON tights I actually consume. 
Presently BTC is easy to "HODL" because my options are limited. 
Buy other crypto on exchange. 
Buy t shirts on the web 
But gift cards  
But then. 
It is gone. And I have to invest. 
I get paid in FIAT. Why not just spend fiat.
The BTC I have now can continue to appreciate. Or not. Whatever. 
I can't do anything practical with it. 
No one person/business I interact with uses it.

So I'm back 24 hours after seeing this; are some cards receiving addresses and some cards loaded physical BTC amounts for others to scan and collect? 
Like if I went to MickyD in the AM and got a brekky, they say .oo0975 should I give them a card to scan for .oo1000 and t hell the deposit the change into a wallet card for 0.oo0025  ?
