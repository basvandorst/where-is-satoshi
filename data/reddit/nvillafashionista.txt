Yup. Way to many people invested in this for it to just suddenly cease to exist or crash further. Only way left for us to go is up. If you really think about it, there is too many millionaires and billionaires in this for it to crash. No way they’ll let that happen. Especially the miners that are mining at a loss right now.
