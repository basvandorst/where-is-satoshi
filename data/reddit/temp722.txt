You can't steal someone's block by being the one to propagate it to the rest of the network. The block coinbase has the miner's address, and changing it would invalidate the hash and PoW. At best an attacker with many many many sybils could saturate the network sufficiently to prevent the block from propagating.

Yeah- segwit softforked also uses an anyone-can-spend script, and has the same property from the perspective of pre-segwit clients.

Here's my interpretation of the enhancement to selfish mining. The paper first describes some techniques in the current Bitcoin p2p network client implementation of denying blocks or transactions to particular nodes, for some length of time. Then it proposes that, while a miner is selfish mining and ahead of the rest of the network, the p2p DoS attacks can be used to partition the network view of the rest of the network. The competing miners are then mining on varying chains, which means they are collectively less likely to catch up to the selfish miner's chain, enhancing the selfish mining attack. The degree of enhancement depends strongly on how effectively the attacker can partition the network, and how many consecutive blocks they can deny.
(Since it's a hot topic, I'll mention that I don't think the paper discusses the effect of block size of the effectiveness of the DoS attack. I don't see how it's relevant to the specific issues exploited, but it seems likely that it could have an effect once mitigations like dynamic timeouts are in place, esp. for slow nodes.)

Phishers are sometimes able to get valid certs issued for domains that they don't own for use in these MITM attacks. You can help avoid this by checking the company information in the certificate, though sometimes this info is faked as well. Certificate authorities aren't perfect (or sometimes even good) at checking that they are issuing certs to the right people.
Further, some certificates use weaker authentication (such as 512-bit RSA) and can be cracked. This includes some trusted intermediate CA certificates, which could be used to generate valid-looking certs for any domain.

You're right that it's not common, but "I haven't seen that for a long time" is not nearly a high enough level of security for my money. Nobody will crack my private key before the heat death of the universe - why shouldn't I have a similar level of security in the other parts of the system? Sure, it's hard, but I think that certificate pinning and proper knowledge of the risks can give strong trust in a cert. We should also be building new technologies to make this more secure.
The TOR/bitcoin situation is particularly ripe for abuse. It's trivial to set up a MITM on a tor exit node, Bitcoin users probably disproportionately use TOR, and the payoff for defeating these users is huge. If an SSL certificate costs $5 and the average payout from hacking a bitcoin web wallet is (perhaps) $500, you can afford to throw a lot of certificates at the problem.
EV certs are actually not that great, imo. Users in general have been trained that the S in httpS means secure, and they aren't aware of the risk of fraudulent but valid certs or often even the importance of checking the domain name. So, when they get phished on  they have no idea what happened. That mybank.com had an EV cert doesn't help at all. (And still doesn't help if they were phished with a fraudulent valid cert on my bank.com.)

VPNing *over* TOR, to a VPN provider that you set up or paid for, accomplishes nothing, because your VPN provider can still correlate your data with you. Assuming your VPN is encrypted there is literally no benefit compared to VPN on it's own, unless you value having a hugely slower connection.
VPNing *to* TOR is much more reasonable because it avoids your ISP knowing that you are using TOR, prevents your VPN provider from seeing your unencrypted traffic, and often allows for better anonymity within TOR if other VPN users are using TOR.

You can't flood 20x1MB in the same timespan because you can only produce (on average, at best) one block every 10 minutes.

Trivial with ethereum. With Bitcoin, you would probably need someone external to check the account and redistribute the funds. (Maybe there's a clever way to pull it off automatically, but it's not obvious.)

Maybe 'smart' isn't the best (or most technically accurate) word to describe it, but I don't think it's entirely inappropriate. When I think of a traditional contract, it is not 'smart'- it is evaluated by humans, and when there is a dispute, the disagreement is resolved by a human arbiter. The contract is 'dumb' since it does not think for itself. A 'smart' contract is different though- by leveraging the network, it almost self-evaluating and to an extent gains the ability to be it's own arbiter. In this sense the contract begins to behave as it's own entity outside of the control of individual humans and that is no longer 'dumb'.
I don't expect you to agree with me, though, since you've obviously already jumped onto the ethereum-sucks-because-ipo-and-it-hasn't-launched-yet-lol bandwagon, and will blindly attack anything remotely related to it. (Or am I wrong?)
