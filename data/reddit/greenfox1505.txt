The only difference is intention. There isn't much use trying to create a distinction.
Kinda like trying to create a distinction between a Troll Flat Earther and an Idiot Flat Earther. You can't really tell them apart but it doesn't matter because you should handle them the same way.

The effort to break encryption is as old as encryption itself. Even those who create security measures (of all kinds) try to break their own security.

Is this even illegal? I know insider trading in other markets can be used as grounds for prosecution in the stock market, but is the wording of the law such that it can apply to this as well?

yes and no. extensions are used in cross platform file types (like media or raw text) so that's when extensions are important. a *.png file is a PNG regardless of OS and the application that launches when you want to see that image will likely think it's reading a PNG unless you change the ending.
For a LOT of icons in both Linux and Windows, the icon is decided by the program that opens it. Change that, and often the icon will change too.

ohgod! you ran it‽‽ ARE YOU CRAZY‽
My thought would be to shut down your computer NOW. Then use a known safe computer to create boot-able Live Linux. Use that to find your wallet file on your old disk (and anything else that you would want to save).
Then (and this is important) CREATE A NEW WALLET AND MOVE ALL YOUR BITCOINS! If he has your PRIVATE key, he can take all your bitcoins! But he can't take them if they are on a new wallet.
Last re-image the entire HDD that held the OS that you ran the virus on. Keeping that OS is dangerous. I know you have antivirus, but it can't keep everything safe. The antivirus is education!
The faster you can move your bitcoin balance the better. That is the ONLY way to ensure it's safety for real. Do not type in any passwords on the infected OS (keyloggers!). Be careful how you handle your next steps to maximize your safety!

kk, I was gunna create a virtual box and test it out, but if others are flagging it too, that's good.
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:20:55
because file extension doesn't matter much in linux. anything can be executable code, anything can be a script, anything can be nearly anything.

people have said their antivirus has caught it. I don't have an antivirus software install because honestly, the best antivirus is education. Me catching this probably proves that!
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:06:53
my point is that there will always be scammers and the best we can do is educate, so a post about scamming should always be sticky (even if it's not mine)

Yeah, only a few years ago, I would have totally fallen for it! so I thought I'd explain why it work. TXT file is one thing, but an TXT file that can execute?! that scares me... especially since my goto for telling people how to avoid this kind of stuff is "never run an suspicious exe!". This flies in the face of a lot of typical internet safety advice...

I wish I had the money to invest back then. I was more worried how I would get enough gas for my car. Spending money on something with intangible benefits would have been hard to justify.
What I did have was a decant GPU. So I started mining. Then when I had enough coins, I bought a better OpenCL GPU to mine more. Right when FPGA and ASIC mining started to become a thing, I sold my gpu for about cost.
And I've been a holder ever since.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:47:28
Right. So, pretty much my only source for Bitcoin news is and only when a post makes it's to my feed. So I'm often completely lost when meme level content gets to my front pages.
Which is to say: "WHAT?"
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:07:56
That's posses a different interesting question. When you do the kind of work they do, how much can you really put in the cloud. Your archiving websites that are stored also on that cloud.

This statement has been made by so many at so many different times. I was mining at $17/BTC. I stopped when my effective hash was no longer "profitable" for the effort. I was ONLY getting 1btc per week off that GPU.
That math would be different now...
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:42:03
Back in my day, I lost like $50 from trying to day trade bitcoins (on MTGox). Of course they were only worth like $100 at the time. Today I hodle. 
That $50-100 of btc from like 4 or 5 years ago is worth a lot more today.

What does this have to do with Just because they are asking for Bitcoins? That seems really silly.
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:42:03
Na. It wasn't. Because I didn't have a job. So it was totally worth the effort. I used hardware I had to mine coins. I used those coins to buy better hardware. My parents paid the power bill. There right choice was to keep mining, but I wanted to run a Minecraft server so I did that instead
@_date: 2012-08-10 07:07:23
yes, most people use a service like mtgox, but some people liquidate directly to a buyer.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:16:20
Yeah, sure. You *could* reduce it. But I chose not to specifically to highlight the difference here. Reducing it completely removes the part that I wanted to highlight. It would completely remove the point I was trying to make. (Mostly to an audience that doesn't nessaily understand BigO)

The sustainability of mining has always been a debate, but as with most economic systems, it's governed by one equation.
Value of product - cost of production
The system will always naturally try to close the gap between these two, but ultimately people will always find their estimates where wrong and now are on the wrong side of this equation.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:14:10
It's Big O Notation. n is some constant (probably the number of possible values for a Bitcoin address digit). x is the number of digits you want in your prefix. So the expression means every time you add one more digit, it's going to take n times as long as the previous input. Add two digits, it's going to take n*n times as long. And so on. So finding 1 digit is fairly quick, but as you add more digits, the time it takes to find a vanity address, it just keeps taking longer and longer.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:32:23
I got into Bitcoin when it was a few dollars. It was less than one a few months before that. I started mining. When I stopped mining, it was &lt;$30. I decided the power per BTC wasn't worth it. I was "only" making one BTC every few days for running a GPU all day.
The point is saying you'll wait till next drop is effectively betting that it will drop, it will drop lower than it is now, and you'll have the presence of mind to jump on it. Is that a bet you're willing to make? I'm not. I already lost that bet once.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:53:36
every additional digit takes O(n^(x+1)) times as long to compute?

I think people hear "coin" and think that must be the smallest messurement. Like if I say "I have 5 bitcoins", they hear "I have 5 {cents in this other currency}". Without knownlege of how it works and virtually never seeing discussion about fractional coins in headlines, it's not an unreasonable assumption.

Does that actually help? How? Doesn't news of it going down cause people to buy (ie buy low)? Or does it get people to sell before it gets too low? Wouldn't news of the higher price cause people to sell to make a profit? Or would they hold bringing the price up?
I don't see how reports of either can definitively impact the price the way you speculate it would.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:05:40

While regulation (controlled accounts and such) is not good, I do not see a problem with taxing bitcoin, as long as it's reasonable, keeping in mind it's very easy to bypass. 
If I had  a consumer to shopkeeper payment for a coffee, I do not think it's unreasonable to tax that transaction. However, if I have deal with a friend, my friend should get 100% what I sent. Basically, how it works now when I hand my friend cash for my half of the pizza.
If my employer pays me in bitcoins, while I might not like it, I see the necessity of paying income tax (but not Social Security; fuck that broken shit). But if I sell something on craigslist, I shouldn't be required to tax them.
Basicly, if it worked like it worked now, I think that would be reasonable. (might not like it, but I understand why it's needed)
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:23:53
I give my friend $20 for watching my dog for the weekend, he's not likely to record that on his taxes.
The shopkeeper is required to have a merchant licence (or something to that effect) to sell products on a public market. That gets taxed at point of sale and income tax for all employees. Even a New York street vendor is required by law to report transactions.
These are two very different transactions.
