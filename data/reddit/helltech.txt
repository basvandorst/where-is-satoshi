Honestly you are correct if your goal is 50k per btc then it doesn't matter when you buy and sell as long as you always have more btc after

The rollercoaster, make sure your seatbelt is on.

No a dip is what we are in right now from the 17-19k price we had. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:33:52
Because of the small drip? It will go back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:45:02
But when bitcoins are mined out after we are all dead then he are o ly being payed off fees

I lost a lot trying to daytrade. You have to guess when the big boys will sell. Sell at the same time and buy at the dip. It's pure dumb luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:43
I lost 2k trying to daytrade, never again.

Government legal tender. Euros, United States dollar, etc.

Everyone here is giving bad advice. Is it a local account or a microsoft account on the computer that you can't get into? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:25:47
Why are you certain? It was 14.1 on Gemini earlier this morning 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:29:48
Buy bitcoin with fiat. Only as much as you can afford to lose. Hold on to that for as long as you possiblecan even if it crashes just have faith and hold. 
You can try daytrading, but it doesn't work out for most people.

It is ok, every time I lost I told myself to HODL and never listened to myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:31:25
Some people thinking buying during a dip to maximize profits  is best. But the problem with that is a dip may never come or you may miss it and then a new ATH happens
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:43:49
What ever you want.

No one else on here that I have read about  that uses Gemini *had* to wire transfer to be verified.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:41
Day trading can be very lucrative.

27 here, 30 percent of my house paid off, payed off car (but need a new one soon), holding for as long as I can. I'd like to pay off my house within 5 years we will see.

I did, I see what you are talking about, but when I try it won't let me do anything because it says I have to do a wire transfer to "verify my identity".  
It specifically says this right in the bank transfer page..  
"This action will be available once you verify your identity by sending in your first deposit via wire transfer."
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:16:17
This is what it says at the top of each page when I try to do ANYTHING. I want to only do ACH.
"Your account has been approved, but is restricted from trading until you send in your first deposit via wire transfer."
And also the roll over text when I try to click anything... "
This action will be available once you verify your identity by sending in your first deposit via wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:47:28
But as much as I could at 6100, no regrets.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:13:36
Sorry yes, miswording. Anyway it says my Gemini account is locked from trading until I make a wire transfer first. I'll edit that.

I emailed them about it and asked why what I gave them wasn't enough. I gave them my social, paystubs, drivers license even and they still say I need to do a wire transfer to verify my identity, I'm not sure why but its the reason I didn't buy BTC back when it was 2500 dollars so I'm kind of pissed off. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:48:32
I don't want to do anything with wire transfers i just want to do ACH from my bank account 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:27:48
It is possible, something to do with verifying my identity but I already gave them so much information. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:10:18
Yeah to start direct depositing
