Haha, as someone who has been in this from 2010, I am telling you BTC has had worse days. it will recover. this is plain market manipulation to shake off weak hands and also a lot of panic sales going on. here is where the line is drawn between winners and losers.
Technology is sound and good as always have been.

Torrent is a p2p network and your upload speed depends on many factors. for example if a torrent has many seeds and few leechs , you wont be uploading with very high speeds because simply there is not high demand.
There are also other factors like network distance and latency to other peers. Our server ports are 1Gbps and I am sure you saw how fast the whole block chain was downloaded :)
Anyway with a seedbox , you wont need to use your home PC and bandwidth anymore , our servers will seed your files 24/7.

You are our first bitcoin customer dude :) I hope you enjoy our service.

Thats a great response to rotten fruit company. in long term we should erase its products from every store. yeah apple , our puch back is hard.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:49:48
Yeah , I guess we are the first bitcoin instant setup seedbox provider :D

I am also in favor of a Dota 2 tournament , it is a great game and will get you tens of thousands of online viewers. I guess you can reach out to JoinDota.com mods and see how you can organize this.

I bought all my coins at $10. dont listen to this guy.  
At the time it had jumped from 0.01$ to $10. Thats a x1000 jump and I still bought it and now I am happy. another x100 for me.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:55:16
I dunno ! Use anybody's server who you trust :)  
I am just running a standard version of ElectrumX 1.0.4 to contribute to network.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:22:06
Actually it is a very powerful server which I use for different purposes. 64GB Ram, 8 core Xeon CPU and 12TB Raid array :D
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:22:25
Exactly this, bitcoin core will die very slowly due to stupidity of core devs.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:24:08
if core had any competence, we were not here, BTC dropping like a rock. It is all on core team.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:42:15
there is no floor, core team fucked up so hard.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:27:09
Hodl and get REKT !
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:58:07
and what if it increases to $10 and $20 levels ? I remember in 2010 we would send a transaction with 1 satoshi fee and it would get confirmed in next block.  
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:53:10
It has nothing to do with BTC Core and BU debacle.  
ElectrumX server is useful for users who use Electrum wallet.

I had the same issue, I ended up compiling Python 3.5.3 from source.

BTC mainnet
@_date: 2017-01-31 02:25:28
This seems like a scam. people beware. domain registered only 15 days ago.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:24:58
Another reason is that blockchain size is so massive. takes about 100GB of your disk space. not everyone is ready to sacrifice 100GB of his space.
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:05:52
They suspended my account and it took me 2 weeks to get my coins back. wish u good luck. stay away from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:18:37
As far as miners are concerned your paid fee is low.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:41:22
I remember the days when we advertised Bitcoin as a cheaper and faster method to transfer money. It is sad to see now we should say if u want a cheaper or faster option use PayPal or VISA.
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:23:03
Opening a 100 Bitcoin position on BitMEX will cost you either 0.075 Bitcoin or -0.025 Bitcoin (rebate) in fees depending on whether you are taker or maker.

So go ahead and sue Apple and Microsoft as well. They can shutdown your pc and iPhone. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:20:26
No it is not, because better and more scalable crypto coins are out there. BTC is losing its dominance and will continue to do so.  
I am not saying BTC price will not increase, it will. but if it increases 10%, other coins will increase by 50%. BTC technology is old and rusty and it has no proper governance.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:25:00
rebroadcast the transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:43:13
I am talking about first plan which is monthly, there can only be one or two difficulty adjustments in one month. it wont have much impact on my math.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:44:55
110% is rational. the extra 10% comes from block mined fees. a lot of pools pay more than 100% (share the mined fees).
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:46:44
can you send a source ?
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:45:53
nope, difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks. has not much impact on my math.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:45:11
Getting loans is easy for millionaires and people with very good credit. the only thing that bank cares about is to make sure you can pay the loan back. if u have good credit, they will beg you to get a loan, thats how they make their money.
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:14:42
so he pays 276% instead of 4% annual interest rate to have banks less involved ? if you believe this, you are so naive.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:51:26
He can do it with banks money and make a fortune doing so.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:48:40
yes, but it needed a malformed request to exploit this bug, normal usage would have no impact, someone found the bug and started sending malformed requests to BU nodes to shut them down.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:42:02
difficulty doesn't change that much in 1 month. it adjusts every 2 weeks. so actual expected return is not much less than 23%.
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:11:39
To be fair, BU nodes were DDOSed, it was not loss of support.
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:45:07
it doesn't answer my question. he could have gotten a loan from a bank and do the same thing (assuming he doesn't have the capital himself !)
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:46:10
Yes, 100% sure. just look at yesterday's messages.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:34:11
Just wait for BTC price to recover and transaction fees go back up to 400 sat/Byte and then tell me devs were right.  
The current decrease in number of transactions has nothing to do with segwit or batching, it has been proven several times, it is just people stopped using BTC due to its crash.
Transaction fees will go up again and I will see you cry in another reddit post.

America ! the center of free world ! yet if u live in Afghanistan, you have better bitcoin exchange choices. sucks to be American in bitcoin world.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:57:56
It is a little bit technical. They can't regulate the price as fast as they want and there is a huge demand for it. Thus the premium. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:30:51
 still recommends 300 sat/byte
