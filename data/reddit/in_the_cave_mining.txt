3 weeks v. 1 day. Sure, but I'm also not shitposting daily about the glory of UASF with old links and lies. 
You know.. if that matters. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:12:56
So your "truth" hinges on the wild conspiracy that Garzik is CIA and a private investor has to be a communist agent cause he happens to be Chinese. 
I'm surprised you don't reference pizza gate and the Mars sex colonies while you are at it, since full retard can be hard to control. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:36:51
Here we go. "The only people that want big blocks are Chinese scary scary miners". Yes retard, that's how it is. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:57:23
Yeah, that's sort of the response I expected. Ha ha. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:27:29
It's easy to have self control when you are dead. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:31:55
Uh huh.. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:07:11
Yes, anyone who doesn't share your confused view is clearly a shill. 
Tell me, who is someone that invests heavily in hashrate ask permission to do so? 
The Chinese have a mining majority because they invested in ASIC. Thats it. 
And to answer your entirely irrelevant question about what happened to other large miners. Well, some are still here, some are not. 
Damn village idiot. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:13:49
I don't care what POW Bitcoin uses as long as it's a good choice. That said. Thinking that pushing $1 billion in ASIC off the Bitcoin network won't affect price negatively in an extreme manner is just silly. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:23:11
Don't pretend that you know what you are talking about. You can mine Bitcoin profitably right now at U.S. average household power cost. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:53:01
Not really what OP asked about though. Craig may be a charlatan douchebag, but is his suggested way forward technically viable?
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:49:43
Nah, I'll let you continue making a fool of yourself. No help needed. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:00:03
When you ask a question and answers don't fit your opinion that doesn't make them wrong. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:13:14
Oh sweet retard. Lots of pools offer over 100% pplns due to merge mining, which is exactly what he did (I get that you probably have no idea what that means but oh well). When you grow up and stop wasting your time whining like a little bitch about things you don't understand and do not affect you I promise you will still be welcome on 4chan. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:02:04
When you are so badly familiar with Bitcoin that you don't even know that there are at least 3 companies manufacturing ASIC chips, then there is really no point in discussing anything else.

The guy that did it at the Bitcoin bowl less than 3 years ago made 20 BTC if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:38:43
Pretending that miner centralization is a "massive threat" is sort of cute when LukeJr is arguing for POW change like it's a real thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:32:50
Well that's obviously total B.S. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:52:42

@_date: 2017-07-07 00:38:30
Oh no what a surprise. Some core shill spending his days making minimum wage to whine about the "scary Chinese miners" being "the only ones" who wants 2x (nevermind the massive list or businesess supporting it etc).
Blow it out your ass retard. 
When August passes without SegWit and price crashes I'll laugh my ass off at all the morons posting retarded shit like PoW change.. 
See you when you broke kid. Well, more broke. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:34:34
are crackpots. That doesn't mean that Chinese miners are evil, or that tber is some kind or communist master plan to rule Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:37:38
Ha ha ha. Yeah, if you define "consensus" as 20% maybe. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:46:14
Damn, snappy comeback. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:56:31
It's funny how it's an 'exploit' and not an optimization when the Chinese are using it. I'm not saying they are in the right, but it's a curious wording. 
I remember when GPU mining was still a thing and every improvement was something celebrated. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:06:01
Core is absolutely pro SegWit, they just don't want it to celebrate with larger block size for some "unknown" reason. 
The community wants both with broader consensus than literally anything at this point. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:06:09
And bandwidth and computer hardware never becomes cheaper or faster. /S
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:22:35

@_date: 2017-07-04 15:06:43

Nevermind. I didn't realize I was talking to someone with diminished mental capacity. Go on sweet boy.

Or a pool supporting More cartoons in newspapers. Roughly as useful. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:16:31
They can be made irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:47:40
SegWit is uncertainty to miners that have billions invested. Not exactly strange that they prefer on chain scaling. It's not rocket science at all. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:51:57
What's your point? BIP148 is a shit idea that is 100% certain to lead to a chain split (though it won't pass so its a non issue). That doesn't mean 2x is GOING to pass by any means, and if it doesn't that't fine as well.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:20:02
So? That's not even part of the discussion. Initial sync can be solved in many different ways including pruning etc. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:23:22
By what is activated. Pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:26:54
Speaks with a forked tongue.  How much profit is to be made outside Bitcoin for destroying it from within? Are you on smack?
There is virtually NO money to be made by destroying Bitcoin because simply put. There would be no money to be made from crypto that doesn't exist. And definitely not even a fraction or the money that 50% of all ASIC represents. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:34:38
OP isn't exactly what we would describe as "the brightest". 
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:07:47
Sure, but no one gave a shit when mining was 90% centralized to the U.S. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:57:36
He's not Chinese so it's not scary enough. /S
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:52:31
Oh dear. POW change is a great way of guaranteeing that core-coin is worthless. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:40:36
You don't see the irony of someone wanting to change proof of work and somehow think that the Altcoin that would be created would retain the value of a Bitcoin backed by $1+ billion in hardware? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:50:08
Not at all. The point is that it's an immutable public ledger that cannot be altered, and that the payment portion is fungible and unstoppable.
The value of that currency can of course be regulated as long as it's "value" is in relation to fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:04:24
You mean instead of just making a post about a code change that happened 3 months ago?
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:29:14
Yes. The scary Chinese government bitcoin takeover. Tell me, is that before or after Obama takes or guns and is it somehow connected to Pizza gate? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:52:40
Sure kid. That's why miners weren't a problem when they were the same people as core developers but now that it's mainly Chinese they are a huge threat. 
This dispute the fact that when the U.S led mining we had pools with 51% of mining power several times, and a far less decentralized mining community than now. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:10:27
Complaining that SHA256 ASIC only has a yearly rate of return of 200% is a little sad though. Still one hell of an investment over virtually any other "traditional" investment out there. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:29:38
Damn son. You said the same thing I did as a comeback... you must be a god damn genius..
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:01:05
New POW, well that's a real nifty way of making sure that Bitcoin lose 80% of it's value overnight. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:42:12
And you think that the answer to 90% of hash power and economy wanting a compromise is to stomp your feet and whine about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:32:06
Only a child would bet anything when they can simply sell their corecoin and make up for the inevitable value drop that will follow a possible chain split. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:44:34
"Free from manipulation" (wants to split off to an altcoin with some hacked together new POW written in a few weeks). 
Yeah.. 'logical' :)
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:52:29
When you use "straw man" as an argument you already outed yourself as a genetically inferior human.

Damn son. You need a new middle school education. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:53:30
"constant attack" ha ha ha. Oh dear. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:16:04
Oh, a new redditor having a very strong opinion on something he doesn't understand. How surprising. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:51:04
Probing for weaknesses = under attack? You do realize that the miner majority could have split the network months ago if they wanted to right?
There also isn't any billion dollar incentive since breaking the network would also break any value it carries. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:01:06
And neither double spend or transaction tracking is an example of a blockchain error. It's simply how the blockchain works. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 01:52:46
Seeing as you seem to not know the difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin I think it's safe to not take you or your throwaway trash account seriously. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:35:27
And it won't matter. At all. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:02:19
Not by who is the loudest on Reddit that's for damn sure. Look at the original SegWit proposal or UASF. Pretty clear that the network wants neither. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:52:48
Oh look a pointless graph and assumptions made by sometime who doesn't understand who bitcoin works. Nah, can't be.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:56:46
Oh the old "proving a negative" narrative. How inventive. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:23:54
I wouldn't go that far. But it's sort of fun that China is "scary" all of a sudden. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:16:14
... sigh. Yes that's exactly what I meant. Not that you can't prove that he does, but that. 
*Shakes head*
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:42:50
No it doesn't. It's a power efficiency tweak, not a hash rate tweak. Those are entirely separate. It does less work, not faster.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:18:25
What does that possibly have to do with Altcoins being a superior investment vehicle for the last few months?
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:29:12
Sure, but this was also the discussion when GPU miners came out, and then when ASIC came out. Only difference being that the same people now accusing the miners of 'cheating' were the ones first to use ASIC and GPU.
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:33:49
Yeah, except ripple is a closed loop debt token system that has nothing in common with Bitcoin. But you knew that of course...
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:27:47
So user sends money in way they don't support and whines like a baby. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:26:30
Aaaaand just like that we know that you have no clue as to how BIP148 even works. Hell, you might not even know how percentages work. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:58:03
Ok fair. If the tool exists within PayPal sure. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:41:15
Oh dear you don't get it.

@_date: 2017-07-04 20:00:08
Ha ha. Yeah, Astro turfing against UASF.. shows your deep understanding of how signaling and economy works that you sincerely believe in a flash in the pan retard plan like UASF. 1000 brand new nodes with no coin backing... Ohh, totally gonna happen now ���� 
Let me know when you realize that offline storage wallets don't actually matter at all for signaling, voting or acceptance of UASF..
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:19:47
1. No one is asking for a rushed hard fork. Simply for a promise of a fork in the future. 2. There is nothing strange or untested about larger block size. It's literally far simpler and more well tested than SegWit. 3. There is zero reason it would be contrasted in a meaningful way since it already has 80% miner support. 4. There is no reason to think that 2x or even 4x block size would be this "decentralization disaster" that some people would like to scare the community into thinking. The amount of nodes have varied wildly over time with no change in block size. Many other factors such as price affect node count. 
I don't personally have a stake in what happens since I don't mine Bitcoin, and I honestly am not worried about short term price. 
That said. I find it disturbing that core has taken to villifying Bitcoin miners to drive home their own solution. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:55:08
Yes. And it's assuming technology doesn't evolve, like it usually doesn't over time. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:42:49
Oh snap. You mean President Hillary? Cause obviously she has to be with all the little Trumpaloompas still whining about her like she runs the place. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:58:04
So no conflict of interest. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:44:31
They all had 1 MB capacity 6 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:37:36
And how long will block time be 1h+ if 90% of hash rate leaves your core-coin chain? Oh just a few weeks..
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:22:29
Asicboost doesn't actually secure the network at app though. It just incentivices miners to skip work and saves power. No additional hash rate is present and no additional investments are made. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:54:42
Factual? Are your parents siblings by any chance? How about you just source me where Garzik is a Government agent and Bitmain is owned by the Chinese government. That would be great. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:24:02
Not even close. This is a completely false world view that somehow people seem to have been fooled into. If one chain has 10 min block times and one has 3h blocks due to a split, the chain with the miners will retain value and the other will crash in value, and have the remaining miners leave. 
Exchanges aren't idiots. They will "allow" both chains to trade and will validate both chains which will just accelerate the demise or "core coin" in a split scenario. 
Unless you somehow think that a POW change turning the shorter chain into a third rate altcoin would be able to compete with $1 billion in ASIC install base. 
Which obviously it won't. 
The only people dumb enough to think the non-asic chain will be a value leader are LukeJr and a few other maximalists that care more about code than they do usability. The only real surprising part of the entire debate is how in the world anyone even pays attention to the code-centric view of those wanting to kneecap bitcoin to keep it 'pure' instead of giving it the ability to truly become a world wide payment system. 
Or as LukrJr would put it "Bitcoin should really only have 128k blocks"
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:13:18
You almost would assume that if you wire $200k you would read the terms of service at least. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:48:02
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:56:33
Yeah, that's why he is agreeing to 2xSegWit. You must be a genius.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:37:34
Aww...  look at you. No idea why you haven't thrown in 'strawman' or 'salty' yet. Usually go-to words for inept tweens when they get frustrated. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:24:13
What you don't "buy" and what can be proven are somewhat different things thankfully. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:17:22
Hah, no. It was a topic of discussion only when separate miners and pools reached 40%-50% of the network. There was near zero discussion that U.S mining concentration was detrimental. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:24:43
I'd like to see myself as "curated" more than vintage but obviously I am clearly the kind of loser they will shitpost for minimum wage. ����
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:36:49
If you don't understand that miners need transaction fees to exist, then you don't understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:49:23
And I would argue that you don't understand the concept of nodes being part of securing the network if you believe that the network should cater to the occasional user over expanding the usability of the network. 
I'm not saying you "can't" run a full node just now and then. There just is very little point to doing it and I don't believe that "occasional" users should be taken into account when making decisions regarding the future of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:52:10
No shit. CEO of Evilcorp trying to make other CEO of Evilcorp look bad. What is this, meta bullshit?
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:58:54
But he wanted you to get angry at his first AstroTurf post. Why you trying to steal his minimum wage income?
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:18:23
Conversely 90% of users won't be able to call you or core on bullshit either so...
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:38:18
Questioning? Why wouls they have to answer and to whom? I'm quite sure you don't understand any of this. They have a bunch of hash power cause they run a bunch of ASIC. What's your point? You seem confused. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:39:52
When you make assumptions you... 
And stop pretending that there are 100s of active and vocal core developers. An idiot can read the logs and watch the commits to figure out that only a handful work on the parts that matter for scaling. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:06:07
There is no "even more" they can already do as they please with the network. We are here because the old "holders" got greedy and sat on their coin instead of supporting the network. 
Chinese miners have 80% of the hash power and hundreds of millions in BTC. They can easily spin up economic majority nodes and control hash rate. It's not a question, it's just reality. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:59:52
I don't think you understand how comments work. The image posted shows no evidence of asicboost what so ever. Jeez, this is what happens when 1 million tweens flock to bitcoin.
Learn to read and realize that asicboost is a power consumption improvement that has nothing to do with hash rate. And that mining low size blocks has nothing to do with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:32:44
What if I told you that UASF is an entirely pointless exercise and has zero chance of success. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:15:43
It's not forcing miners to do anything. Look at adoption rate and you will know why. There is literally zero adoption among the economic majority needed. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:35:13
This. No idea why Bitcoin maximalists are allergic to money. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:39:42
"IF" ha ha, what part of the situation is an 'IF"? Look at the signaling two weeks before final date. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:52:37
It's more than 60%, but that has little to do with it being less secure or decentralized than most shitcoins where a single pool often have 50% or more of the hash rate.
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:30:31
I applaud the children who wants decentralization so bad that they are willing to take a 75% price decrease on their BTC. Too bad none of them have the economy to affect anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:38:41
Yeah, that's what power savings mean. It doesn't mean that anyone raises their hash rate without investment. Which is why it's not a hash rate increase. It also does not optimize anything since it's not causing more work to be performed, it just skips some of the work. 
And no. It does not increase the hash rate of a given miner. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:06:58
What other reason is there to think Chinese miners are bad actors, while U.S. miners somehow were not? Please tell me.  Hell, back in 2013 we even had U.S pools with 51% of network hash, something that the cheese have avoided. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:29:59
Ha ha. You are too dumb to understand the research. Sort of sad. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:54:42
And how is Bitmain funding Bcoin different than Blockstream funding core? There's some heavy cognitive dissonance working here. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:13:40
Pointless effort that hasn't changed a single thing. Honestly, just another few months wasted. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:01:19

@_date: 2017-07-12 13:43:36
So just like the current Bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:43:02
Doh. But we have had 1MB blocks for 8+ years. Is your argument that Bitcoin simply didn't work 8 years ago, or that internet capacity and computer hardware hasn't improved significantly since?
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:00:16
Yes, but the "efficiency" expresses itself in less power usage in ASIC, not higher speed. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:57:15
Ha ha.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:53:50
I would argue that you are wrong. Core has shown in the last few months that they are open to review and feedback, but they close ranks around what they consider to be "the best solution" and slams the door on ideas that they don't like. 
Look at the core devs on SegWit, 2x etc. They lack understanding of what the community wants. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:54:18
Only a moron would post that image and somehow claim it has anything to do with asicboost. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:56:48
As long as "due time" is a point when you are comfortable with a 80% drop in Bitcoin price then POW change isn't a bad idea at all. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:15:12
Asicboost is a power effectivity improvement, not a direct income increase. But for the sake of argument the entire point of the miners is that bigger blocks are needed to offset income drop @ next halving. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:43:47
"The best people. Really great people, with lots of knowledge. Just the smartest, best people"
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:59:34
"the network wants" apparently not. And don't get me started on UASF. It's a pipedream supported by a small and vocal part of the community that have no idea of what they want or why. Not gonna happen, just like the original SegWit proposal. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:27:17
Agreed. I respect the code abilities of the core devs but at this point they are simply holding back progress in the same way as the BU crowd. They simply don't understand that sometimes the best solution is a compromise, and not whatever is the technically most elegant. 
If 70% of the community wants SegWit and will accept larger blocks, and 70% wants larger blocks and will accept SegWit, just do both. It's not fucking rocket science. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:40:00

Oh snap. You are on fire kid. Protip, if you want someone to not think you are just a sad child. Maybe not name your Astroturf account 'throwaway'.. you dimwittede bastard. Ha ha
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:59:11
Gavin wasn't made irrelevant due to a lack of technical understanding. He was forced out due to politics. You do have a point but I don't mean that all the core devs would be ousted by any means, just that "core" as we know it would be broken up into smaller groups with narrower focus. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:33:09
Cause lukejr is an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:05:29
At least the quality of posts in this sub isn't changing. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:45:45
Ha ha, yes! You brilliant bastard. NO ONE has more than one reddit account. Jesus, how do you not hurt yourself getting dressed in the morning?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:08:49
Oh, so the overlap of core developers and Blockstream employees and funders doesn't mean they get paid by Blockstream. 
Oh wait they already admitted that is the case. Oh..
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:07:05
But writing 3 page articles that look exactly like editorial content even though it's a paid as works about the same way. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:35:14
There is no "given up control to the miners" simply because they have always had control. Entities that invest billions in hardware to secure the network are the ones that SHOULD have control. The only reason everyone is freaking out is pure racism. From 2009-2014 mining was highly concentrated to the U.S and no one even contested that miners we're the gatekeepers of the network. Then the Bitcoin rich in the west stopped investing in mining hardware and all of a sudden miners became "scary".

"signaling UASF is pointless unless you hold significant coin" 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:48:43
Ah, never-mind. Apparently you are mentally slow. Your point seems to be that no method is a method, since any method you don't agree with is just 'a whim'... so yeah, maybe you should look at Onecoin instead..
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:53:51
Please stop. You were wrong, now you look stupid. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:33:49
Pretty sure that I prefer a coin with 90% of ASIC support than a core-coin with 2 hour block times, and some new hack-code with POW change and a price of.. oh maybe $10 per coin or so
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:50:27
Herro, I comment only for glory of Chinese republic. We take over Bitcoin now yes? You weetarded that post image and whine like bitch yes..
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:37:26
If you only "fire your node now and then" you are not the kind of person that should run a full node. It's that easy. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:05:54
You seem to have some some pretty severe reading comprehension problems. Then again, I assume you are 15 years old, and no clue what you are talking about. 
Good luck with that AstroTurf minimum wage check kid. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:28:01
Yes, if we don't agree with some random tard on Reddit we must be delusional. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:49:40
I don't like Ver much either, but common. Bitcoin Magazine is about as much as a pay for play shitpile as you can find in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:09:20
Why would that bother or surprise me. I am also a miner but I think UASF is a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:08:19
'enough to get started' ha ha ha.. yeah, it will be  incredibly useful at 1%
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:55:58
"and things like that" yeah...
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:56:51
I believe exactly none of this. Local attack the one time OP uses windows in a way that leaves zero trace. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:16:02
POW change is the most effective way to wipe out essentially app value. So in that sense it is indeed effective. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:47:48
Idiots make assumptions. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:12:40
Okidoki kid. Then why don't you explain how 1000 new nodes with no economic backing in any possible way matters to signaling or activation of UASF. Also, while you are at it. How is UASF gonna hit 51% by August? ��
I'll wait. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:23:24
Still a better investment than shit pepes. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:03:15
I'm fine sitting half and half and having a pint until this blows over. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:45:48
And now we know that you have ZERO idea what you are talking about. Good.
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:58:27
1000 pointless AstroTurf nodes pretending that signal with no economic backing matters . Which it doesn't. Yay...
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:42:15
Ha ha ha, the delusion is strong with you if you think people will join a valueless chain over the actual Bitcoin network secured by billions in ASIC.
Protip: If the 'entire community' were interested in going along you wouldn't have to fork off to some altcoin crap to begin with. That's sort of what 'consensus' is all about.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:46:54
Not at all. I just find it hilarious that 99% of all the "UASF tards" are brand new accounts just loaded to the brim with opinions but absolutely clueless of how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:21:26
Aww.. it thinks I'm it's mom. I know it's a shitty job to faceroll the keyboard for $1 an hour. But until you actually learn how crypto works, you are just gonna have to get used to being a somewhat glorified lot-lizard. 
Just keep your chin up and keep on sucking kid. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:45:12
See that's the mindset that makes this a shitshow. By definition, if the majority of nodes and miners makes a change to the blockchain it's NOT an attack. It's consensus.
If you don't agree to that, maybe Bitcoin isn't for you. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:36:33
It is sad. The saddest part being that core somehow has managed to dupe a large part of the community into thinking that miners somehow are evil and want to destroy the network. Whatever the hell they would gain from making their billion dollar equipment worthless is of course unknown. While the people behind SegWit / core of course have zero ulterior motives and it's just a coincidence that every single Employee and founder of side chain projects also is a developer that is against larger blocks. 
So much coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:45:15
Only idiots think UASF has a chance in hell. But have fun signaling.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:58:10
And several members or core wants you to ignore their obvious conflict of interest as investors or employees of Blockstream. Tell me how that's different again?
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:47:40
Or as Einstein Said "if something has happened in the past it will always continue happening this way".. oh wait..
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:35:52
You can guarantee it filling with a dark order or just placing the buy $1-$3 over market price. $500k isn't market moving amount on any of the Top-10 exchanges.

Whenever Blockstream is behind something I just fucking assume it's some nefarious shit. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:58:28
Impossible since 90% of the AstroTurf kids that whine about it are 14 years old and have no clue as to how Bitcoin works, they just know the Chinese are scary. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:41:08
"Join us in crashing Bitcoin price 90% while we figure out how to swap POW, and are stuck with 1h+ blocks with literally NO hash power to secure our network"
Uh, no thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:15:31
No you couldn't. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:15:50
80% decline in price isn't "that bad" unless of course it leads to Litecoin, Etherum etc. Overtaking Bitcoin and sidelining it. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:14:43
Why? Because it was a bad idea to start mining in 2013 when Bitcoin hit $1100?
Saying they are "late to the game" is the same as saying Bitcoin will never be worth more than what it is now. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:12:26
Hah... And you think Visa or Amex would touch that with a 10ft pole?

Happens all the time "in penny stocks". 
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:52:30
Then what the hell are you even interested in bitcoin for? If all you want is some pretend use capital flight instrument you can just use Ripple or some other centralized debt token. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:33:15
UASF never mattered in the least. People that think it ever did are legitimately stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:14:56
Ha ha ha. You night as well start your own shitcoin kid. Pow change is the true pipe dream of idiots.

Investing or trading? The distinction is exceptionally important here.

No need to split just $500k you can fill that OTC or through Gemeni without moving price at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:32:30
The fact that the minimum wage UASF astroturf children think they matter in the least is absolutely hilarious. Everyone with half a brain knows it was just a pipedream pushed by 3 day accounts with no economic value nodes what so ever. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:13:18
UASF was a pipedream from the beginning, just like SegWit 95% threshold. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:12:14
Depending on how you see it, Bitcoin has already 'lost'. With Etheruem up 4500% in the time Bitcoin is up 200%
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:12:59
So.. like startups..
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:20:36
You got to be the dumbest kid on the playground. Since they don't, at all support that sham. 
They expressed the opinion that they will follow the market, you slow fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:33:44
It is pretty damn weak to pretend that economic consensus somehow is "more right" than mining hash rate though. Being hostile towards a massive amount of people that actually invested their coin in securing the network and pretending that people that simply sat on their coin are "better" is just pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:19:27
Oh no, I think I'll just stick to my original opinion that you are a fucking idiot pushing a pipedream for retards.

@_date: 2017-06-30 15:46:00
I don't mine Bitcoin so personally I don't have a stake in the game. That said, pretending that there isn't an obvious bias in both camps (core and miners) is simply silly. 
Miners wants larger blocks to ensure transaction space and income in a low block reward future, while Blockstream etc. Wants small blocks to ensure a better position when setting transaction fees on side chain transactions. 
There is no right or wrong side, but pretending that core is simply "looking our for the users" is laughable. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:50:26
Sadly Bitcoin magazine used up all their possible credibility years ago when they started selling opinion pieces to the highest bidder. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:32:03
No you aren't. And even if you were, "volume" doesn't mean you can sell power under production costs.

You are not ever going to beat Washington power prices simply on scale anywher else in the U.S. period. That's simply not how power companies work. It's not about scale or delivery cost after a certain point, it's about how much they actually spend on producing the power, and that's why you can't beat Washington Hydro plants. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:09:07
UASF has NO support except for morons and paid troll accounts. Pathetic effort.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:33:11
Sorry, if you are not smart enough to read you aren't smart enough to understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:15:16
You apparently don't even understand how signaling works.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:11:01
In short. For mining to be viable after the next halving, and the next etc. We need larger on chain scaling to allow enough transactions to fit into a block to make up for the lost mining reward. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:19:35
Are you on crack or just a complete idiot? The entire underpinning of the network security model relies on miners being able to mine profitably. If you don't understand that, you have literally missed 70% or what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:33:24
Who cares? You are throwing good money after bad money. Have fun losing more than you had.

Poloniex has been making $5 million a DAY for 100 days straight (at least). Assuming that they are insolvent is a pretty long leap.

@_date: 2017-06-30 14:18:56
No. He's violently oversimplifying it. The truth us that there is NO "original" or "right" single method for voting or signaling community consensus. It's a messy process.

Dead cat bounces aren't a thing in bull trend. And it only applies to shares based on fundamentals. 
You could argue (if you believe in TA) we are at a short term top.  
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:26:49
That's sort of the point you fucking toddler. Changing pow.. ha ha. How did someone so dumb even hear about Bitcoin? 
If you are too dumb to grasp that Bitcoin is valuable because of the financial underpinning of investment in ASIC, then you should probably just stick to build-a-bear at the mall. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:14:01
Oh dear. You SENT them $2000, they didn't magically take it. They are also not obligated to do crap for you, and can just return the money.

No. There are sound arguments against very large blocks. There is zero real arguments against 2-8 MB blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:33:36
Nothing is more dangerous than thinking that anyone outside of the echo chamber is a paid shill or troll. But go ahead and think that every single time bitcoin tumbles it's just 'weak hands and trolls'.

He's not right either. He's simply pulling shit out of his ass that fits his own view. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:06:00
I don't think that matters either. BIP 148 has nowhere near the needed support even with 1000 new pointless nodes signaling. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:01:35
Cause hardforks are so scary and Bitcoin, being on it's 144th year as the leading payment system in the Galaxy shouldn't under any circumstances risk a slight dip in price to be able to scale or evolve. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:36:31
Shit solutions aren't the answer to problems. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:54:46
Yeah that's what I meant. Sorry, used "charge" ambiguously. When you load it converts so that no coin is ever held by bitpay was my point. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:29:25
No. That's 100% total bullshit. More transaction space equals higher value of Bitcoin which offsets a small drop in nodes. If you have a 56k modem in Africa you shouldn't run a node anyway. 
Have you ever heard of another technology where you want to stop development and growth because you don't think technology will be able to keep up? 
No. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:17:39
Ha ha ha. Again with trying to pretend that node count matter in UASF. Jesus you guys are dumb. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:06:52
I did read about that. It seems fairly easy to avoid if the devs wants to though since it's an entirely known vector. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:11:15
Purse.io is useless with the limits they have on purchases. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:04:05
It's easy to be negative towards something stupid, that is being pushed by paid AstroTurf accounts and now 1000 pointless new nodes. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:14:58
No. That's the reason that YOU NEVER SEND Bitcoin directly from an exchange to a address you do not control. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:41:04
Running anything of LukeJr is the height of stupidity. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:33:58
I personally think it's fucking rediculous that there is even a discussion. SegWit2x should be the obvious solution and the hard fork wouldn't be contested if core didn't have ulterior motives for keeping on chain scaling back. 
There are literally NO sound arguments against larger blocks AND SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:40:49
Blockstreams entire business model is based on collecting transaction fees from side chain transactions. Keeping blocks small directly affects their bottom line and negotiating position vs. miners. 
No matter how you twist that it makes them biased. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:43:39
Problem is that if you to claim that Blockstream funding core developers is not a problem you can't claim that Jihan is a Chinese government agent that owns all of the hash power in China. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:46:04
Asicboost isn't the same as Chinese miners kid. You might want to learn that. 
The narrative of the scary Chinese miners destroying Bitcoin is also a hell of a lot older than the knowledge or existence of Asicboost. 
But other than that, you are totally understanding things. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:55:26
So Bitmain funding Bcoin dev is evil, but Blockstream funding core is not. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:35:57
There are bad actors everywhere. Core has several bad actors working doe Blockstream pretending to be unbiased. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:14:42
Oh no, such paid shill. Much terrible thing. Blow it out your ass. It's beyond pathetic to push UASF at this point.
