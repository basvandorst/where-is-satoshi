The price needs to stabilize for it to be useful. I don't want to spend a currency that will triple next week and businesses don't want to accept a currency that will drop 50% overnight. 
Yes. Some companies are doing it, but it's either that they're willful pioneers or that it's such a tiny percentage of their business that they don't care. If you're struggling to keep your restaurant doors open, as most locally owned restaurants are, it's a pretty big risk to be taking in BTC right now, unless you are immediately converting it to cash, which will drive the price down.

And The Wall Street dudes creating ETFs to track and profit off it using traditional fee structures. Or the early investors, like the Winklevoss twins. Or the venture capitalists creating new coins to ICO. 
Wait a minute... Rich people getting richer... This seems familiar.

It's the legal tender of the United States and it's required to pay taxes and employees, so yes, it has some intrinsic value. I am not attacking fiat currency, I may have done a poor job, but I am sort of attacking the general public's perception that "I want a lot of money". Holding money is financially speaking, a bad idea in most instances. 
Another reason why I have qualms with cryptoshillers. There's an idea that we can buy a new form of money with an old form of money and we'll all get rich when that just doesn't make financial sense. 
No judgement against those who just like the idea of a digital currency. Whatever. Blockchain is neat stuff and has its uses, but I'm guessing the "You GOTTA BUY THIS DIP! HODL! DOUBLE DOWN!" folks are hoping their portfolio increases in value.... fiat valuation ironically.

A revolution for the working class, little guy... Led by The Winklevoss Twins and John McAfee? 
There is this sense amongst the base that crypto will somehow solve the world's problems by replacing the evil fiat. Thing is, it's still money. If you make shitty wages, who cares how you get paid in them? You won't be able to afford healthcare with dollars or crypto, because you won't have any. We can't all be crypto-rich.

Can't argue with you there. You sound like someone from the early days of crypto. I don't have any problem with blockchain as a technology, I just don't think it's a silver bullet. I was a big believer from about 2011-whenever I lost all my coins when Cryptsy went belly up. If we go from paper to bits, OK. Cool. There will still be a banking system and credit and wages etc.
And as far as who cares about the price... Well I'd say most people holding it are. I'm all for disruption, but I just don't see this as a disruption that is going to benefit normal people in any large way.

Also, someone in Indiana stole my credit card three years ago and Chase asked me if I had made those purchases. I did not, so my money was returned. Who do I call when my BTC wallet number is stolen?
Sure. The merchants lost money, but they failed to ask that person for ID like they should have. 
I also get 1.5% cash back. Again, the merchants pay fees when I use my card, but I also owned a small business for five years and paid those fees because customers would make larger purchases with credit than cash. So I made more money. 
Banks don't make money because fiat exists. They make money by loaning money. I pay zero for my checking account and I pay no interest because I pay my balance money. 
If Trump declares BTC the new dollar tomorrow, banks will start loaning BTC and make that instead.

If you wanna use $5000 dollars to buy crypto, you owe the bank $5000 in fiat, plus interest. I'm talking about actually borrowing and lending in a volatile currency. They'll loan you $5000 to buy a jet ski too.

How does bitcoin get rid of interest rates? If you need currency to purchase a house, the people loaning you this currency will want to see some return. 
Loaning for interest is 7000 years old.
Also, if I open a savings account with 100$ and they give me 1.5% I get a paltry $1.50 a year. If I put 1 BTC in a wallet, in a year I have 1 BTC. Am I just supposed to rely on permanent deflation as a source of savings income?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:33:59
Yea. I just imagine waking up tomorrow and America has outlawed fiat and we've gone 100% crypto and all these subreddits rejoice and pray for big gains. Meanwhile some guy working at McDonald's gets informed he now makes 0.001235BTC/hour instead of $9/hour and doesn't give a rats ass.

If you're a financial purist and want to buy a car or a house outright with cash, that's fine. I don't operate that way, personally. I could have sold 20k worth of stock and bought the car outright if I had chosen to, but considering the very low interest rate they were offering it seemed like a better idea to take it. Had the interest rate been 10%, I would have said hell no. 
A 6 year loan at 1.9% means that over the course of the note, I will pay them $21,177.47 for the privilege of borrowing $20,000, in essence is cost me $1,177.47. 
Now the stock market has an annualized return of about 8%, historically speaking. So if I hold that $20,000 in stock over that period of time instead, I will hold about $31,737.49 worth of stocks at the end of the six year period, a gain of $11,737.49. So I'd be up $10560.02 as a net transaction. Now there's some details like taxes and whatnot in there, but generally speaking it makes better financial sense. 
Stock markets obviously involve risk, but it was a risk I was willing to take when I bought a car 10 years ago that worked out well, so I was willing to take it again. If the S&amp;P 500 gets cut in half and sits there for 10 years, my bad, but historically, the return is about 8%.

I've spent my entire adult life on both sides of the merchant/client world of banks, merchants processors, etc. I'm aware of the fees. Yes, I have benefited by gainful employment and good credit, but so will someone in an all crypto world. Borrowing and lending will still exists and there will still be fees involved. Now, we could do away with transaction fees, but most businesses would likely opt to pay someone some small fee to secure/insure their money, as opposed to betting it all on a thumb drive.
I don't think the current system is perfect, but I would be much more apt to attack the economic system and political system as opposed to the monetary system. 
If we went all crypto tomorrow, my guess is the Koch brothers will be fine and I will still be lower middle class and my neighbor will still be broke. The absence of merchant fees isn't going to solve economics. I'm not against blockchain, I am against the idea that it's a silver bullet.

You seem to think I am shilling crypto. 100% of my savings us in stocks, bonds and a rental property. I keep some dollars around for spending or emergencies, but it represents little of my net worth. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:35:27
I would send you all my dollars... If you signed a contract guaranteeing interest and collateral i.e. how banking has worked forever. I don't like holding more dollars than I need to. I'd prefer get a return on them. 
I'm in total agreement with you on fiat. I'm just stating that holding a 100$ bill or point zero whatever BTC doesn't actually do anything for you. You need to exchange it for something. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:54:20
Imagine taking out a 100,000 BTC loan to pay for your tuition 9 years ago. Deflation helps people with assets. Inflation helps people with debt. There's a reason literally every central bank on the planet accepts this reasoning. 
Or they're just some evil cabal of anti-crypto shitlords. /shrug

Probably better to ask some of the tech experts around here, but the "hacks" for the most part involve currency being held somewhere outside your own personal wallet.
For example, when you are buying and selling these coins on an exchange, your coins are held on that exchange until you cash out. The buyer and seller aren't actually transacting. The exchange transacts for them. I don't use NiceHash, but I imagine they had some form of holding pool that was attacked. If the exchange gets hacked, everyone gets hacked, but there are a lot of different types of these "hacks".

Yes. Banks make money by loaning fiat for a return of more fiat, not because fiat exists. 
I just took out a loan of 20k at 2% interest to buy a Honda Civic (My credit is really good). I took a risk in doing so because I have to pay that back, but I know that our banking system is designed to create 2% inflation, so as long as I'm gainfully employed, my dollars should be fine to repay that loan over the next six years. It will actually get easier in theory if my wages match inflation. 
Now if I had borrowed 3 BTC to buy the car, I'd be very nervous, and so would the bank. If BTC goes to $100k, well now I owe the bank 300k worth of BTC. So the car is getting repo'd. If BTC goes to $100 well that would be pretty great for me cuz I'm gonna take 300$ and pay the loan off, much to the banks chagrin. 
The banks are scared of crypto because it's fucking scary! Major fluctuations in either direction result in a default or a huge loss in this case. Stable money is the backbone of economies. As long as people are getting rich off of crypto currency, it's not a very good currency. It's an asset class. Why would I buy a cupcake and a coffee with crypto when my crypto might triple next week? I'd be "hodling". I spend or invest all of my dollars because dollars themselves are worthless! All currencies are worthless!
They are the plasma of the economic body. They move useful things from one place to another. People say "I want money", but what they want is a car, or a house, or food, or financial security. You can't do shit with money or BTC. It's plasma.

Again, you seem to be arguing with me while I agree with you. Just saying that a $100 bill in my pocket isn't doing much for me until I spend it. It gives me spending power, but people put too much emphasis on fiat. Very little of most people's net worth is in cash. Sure, it's denominated in it, but fiat exists to enable the transfer of services and goods. I far prefer it to a barter system.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:29:24
Why is taking a six year loan at 1.9% a bad idea? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:36:07
I know how inflation works. 
The actual equation for inflation looks like this: MV = Py
M is your monetary supply. V is the velocity of money. P is prices of goods/services. Y is the quantity of goods/services sold in a specific time period.
Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million, at which point it should be come solely deflationary if it is being used in increasing values. So you are correct, the early holders of the money will see it increase in value, soooo... what about everyone else?
Also, there is this notion that "banks" control the money. My local bank doesn't control the money. They hold deposits and lend against them. They don't care what we call the money, they just want to make some of it off of that process. The Federal Reserve controls the US Monetary supply. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:58:06
Wage growth vs. inflation is a fiscal issue more than it is a monetary issue. Stocks and bonds are appreciate assets for the masses as well now that there are services that offer easy access to it. 
Obviously BTC has for outperformed the stock and bond market in the last few years (until recently), but at some point all bull markets have to stabilize. It doesn't make economical sense for everyone to buy bitcoin and it goes up 100%/year forever until we're all rich, any more than it does to buy gold coins for the same purpose.
