Amazing investing dude. Well played. Anyone here putting shit on you is either:
- A troll
- Jealous 
- Stupid 
- All of the above

@_date: 2018-01-26 03:09:30
Let’s agree to disagree then. You’re thinking that people who run these unregulated businesses are to be trusted and do what they say they will without any regulation or oversight? They’ll just self-regulate, keep honest and have everyone’s money backed up 100%? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:34:36
It’s not Bitcoin “Core” for fucks sake. Just Bitcoin. 
Satoshi’s Whitepaper was called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. 
Not Bitcoin Core: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.
Stop trying to push Ver’s dodgy narrative!
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:53:51
You just totally contradicted yourself. First sentence you say diamonds are rare. Final sentence you say “diamonds are actually the most common”. 
Which one is it fella??
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:14:35
Well said. It doesn’t need to be mutually exclusive. Both can coexist and you can use both for different reasons at different times. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:24:26
Much respect and thanks for this post mate. I have a question if you don’t mind? You now have a very significant amount of your wealth in bitcoin - how have you dealt with the recent big drops, as well as the prospect of the potential flippening a couple of months ago? My “reasonable” initial spend on cryptos is now not so reasonable - and has become reasonably substantial and I was sweating a bit during all this. How have you remained calm seeing $13k shoot up to over half a million? It’d be a lot to lose?
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:54:42
You know, I never thought I’d be this type of person - but I really (really) fucking hate Roger Ver and what he and his cronies have tried to do to bitcoin. The gall of this guy to literally copy the protocol, cut &amp; paste the logo, copy the brand name and make a minor tweak to the block size - and then tries to tell everyone that he’s the visionary saving Satoshi’s vision etc etc. He’s an A-Grade fucken arsehole.

You’ll live to regret that statement soon. Tether is a cancer/blight on the sector. If you believe that Bitfinex owners have $2 billion (USD $2,000,000,000.00) sitting in a bank somewhere backing this shit you’re kidding yourself. It’s going to go sour and will be next Bitconnect. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:17:07
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:54:05
So you’re saying that a major investor in bitfinex, the company behind tethers, says anecdotally that tethers are ok and we should just all chill. OMG, please tell me you’re kidding? Please?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:57:46
Fella, you’re the idiot if you believe they have 1-for-1 US dollars in reserve (as they are adamant they have) for each tether released? So, yes. There’s no fucking way they have “2-3 billion saved up”. Educate yourself fool. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:24:36
Roger Ver is a slimey fucking cunt who sells his derivative carbon copy of bitcoin as his original concept. Without his logo cut &amp; paste, brand name rip-off it’d be just one of the hundreds of shitcoins out there.

Intrinsic value is subjective. If I believe it has value it has. If you don’t it doesn’t. If enough people believe that it has value it has widespread value - and Wall Street just said bitcoin has value too. So in short you’re in the minority.

You kidding? Barely a blip? Amazon accepting Bitcoin would be the story of the year! Absolutely huge. For one - it’d allow us to use Bitcoin to buy everything from screws to television sets. It’d be a game changer. Let alone that it would also introduce a whole new audience to Bitcoin too. Sheesh....!
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:08:42
Bitcoin has become an officially sanctioned financial instrument - and Bitcoin trade in Japan accounts for about 60% of the global trade volume. Their government passed laws earlier this year, recognizing bitcoin as a legal form of currency. Your lack of insight/belief for the potential of this is embarrassing. “Everyone’s getting fucked” hey? Maybe it’s just you who’ve been fucked?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:13:16
Mate, I’m 100% with tackling government malappropriation and corruption et al. I have a serious question for you as you seem to have an informed view - state actors go to war regularly in the name of their financial systems. Be it capitalism, socialism or communism - all will happily annihilate the other to protect their privileged positions and financial interests. 
Now, if Bitcoin were to start making such inroads to seriously disrupt actual fiat value - wouldn’t the world’s major capitalist governments (the G-8 or G-20 nation members) literally fight this tooth &amp; nail? I mean straight out outlawing it by revoking trading licences of exchanges, criminalising receiving Bitcoin (or other cryptos) by retailers? 
If it really does become the real deal - won’t the majority of law abiding citizens drop it immediately and stay the fuck away from anything that’ll piss the government off? 
It’s not a stretch to think this could actually occur in the next five years. 
Thoughts OP? (Or anyone?)
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:51:57
In Australia we have a thing called Poli. It allows us to instantly transfer online funds to an exchange (Coinstop) and buy crypto straight away. Literally real-time funding. I’m continually amazed that the USA has such a fucked up banking system? We have kyc/aml laws just as stringent as any developed nation, but can bank much quicker than our yank brothers &amp; sisters.

It is both. It is easy as fuck to understand if you take several hours to seriously read up on it. But these old school economists trying to come off as experts after reading a few tabloid articles look patently ridiculous trying to get their heads around this big financial shift. They almost all the time come across as fucking amateurs trading on their laurels from 30 years back in their ‘ol dot-com days!

You know what mate - you’re down in the dumps and need to have a change. Can you take six months off from your work/commitments atm? I’ve been in your shoes - if you were to pack up your things and head off to a place like Goa, India or to Bali, Indonesia ect you could see that there’s a big, big world out there filled with nice people.

I know what you mean. I read a long email I wrote to my dad in early 2013 who invests in shares. I begged him to buy one Bitcoin. Just one I said. A big fat nope - not interested he said. Must kill him watching the news reports these days. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:27:31

Full agreement mate. Only problem is that Core are really fucking up in the PR war. I wish so much they’d put out a statement, or say something publicly to address Ver’s constant attacks. Why won’t they just say something, anything about what’s coming to Bitcoin to give the supporters hope?
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:24:39
Well said. Maybe it’ll be revered as Doge Coin is - and bitcoin will be held for sentimental reasons due to the ground it broke ushering in the crypto revolution and whose shoulders the next generations of cryptos will have been built on.

Buy 1/10th or 1/20th of a Bitcoin. A percentage rise in X cash invested is the same if you invest $100 or $10,000. Think of it as an additional savings account with good interest payments.

Many people have risked their money over history and been on the winning side of the ledger, it’s just that we’re used to being in the vast majority who gets fucked over by the system and the game. 
This time we’re in the winners circle BEFORE institutional money got in, and we each have a real chance at grabbing the golden ring - for real. 
We’re just at that sociological sweet spot to have seen the internet arrive, watch it boom &amp; bust and then been in the right spot when the next big thing came along and we realised the utility of it early on. Luck &amp; timing plays a huge role in who wins the prize at the end of the day.

Exactly. Of course this sector is going to crash (sometime) and then the fucking tons of absolute shitcoins will be gone and just the serious contenders left. Basically it’ll go from 1,300+ shitcoins to about 150 half decent alts. And Bitcoin will come back - again!

@_date: 2017-12-03 10:14:17
Not to the same degree. But these thousands of shitcoins and ICOs (plus Tether) will not end well. A massive shake up of the crypto ecosystem is coming - but Bitcoin and the good alts will remain. We’ll have to hodl like mutha fuckers during it though, and a 40-50% drop for a few months is not out of the question. I think it’ll pick up magnitudes quicker than 2013/14 as there’ll be global markets waiting to pick up bargains.

Even with amnesia, hopefully you’ll feel this weird little lump, have it removed and looked into. You’ll read the note you wrote for yourself, recognise this collection of random words as a password and scramble to buy a Ledger Micro Titanium (the world’s defacto wallet &amp; personal bank) and recover your Bitcoin to live like a King in future land.

Mate, I’m 100% with tackling government malappropriation and corruption et al. I have a serious question for you as you seem to have an informed view - state actors go to war regularly in the name of their financial systems. Be it capitalism, socialism or communism - all will happily annihilate the other to protect their privileged positions and financial interests. 
Now, if Bitcoin were to start making such inroads to seriously disrupt actual fiat value - wouldn’t the world’s major capitalist governments (the G-8 or G-20 nation members) literally fight this tooth &amp; nail? I mean straight out outlawing it by revoking trading licences of exchanges, criminalising receiving Bitcoin (or other cryptos) by retailers? 
If it really does become the real deal - won’t the majority of law abiding citizens drop it immediately and stay the fuck away from anything that’ll piss the government off? 
It’s not a stretch to think this could actually occur in the next five years. 
Thoughts OP? (Or anyone?)

You said IOTA! The next BIG thing alongside Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:20:40
It has the cryptographic backbone that BTC has without a blockchain, offers fee-free micro transactions and gets progressively easier to use the larger the IOTA ecosystem becomes. I'm not an expert by a long shot - but have put a few grand into it due to its promising future. Check it out - I'm sure you'll see the potential value in it. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:35:55
My biggest deal was downloading the ENTIRE blockchain and having to slowly update it each time I wanted a transaction. Also making sure I didn't fuck up my wallet.dat file was pretty major!

It's cryptographically secure with no blockchain infrastructure (doesn't need mega computing power to figure POW and each PC is a full or light node). Most of all, its capped and enables literally fee-free micro-transactions. It's worth a look as it only went public a couple of months ago and is in the top 6 or 7 cryptos out there.

Wouldn't the combination of massive lost funds, a near anonymous way to pay a hitman anywhere on the globe and a cohort of people who got into Bitcoin originally because they were sick of dealing with criminals to buy coke, pot, ecstasy, ice or LSD be a dangerous mix?

You’re assuming that Core will not heed the lessons of the old behemoths and will fail to upgrade the code and allow Bitcoin to become irrelevant? Yes, we’d like them to move quicker - but they are the custodians of a world-changing financial technology, so it’s probably sensible to have them move forward strategically and not at the behest of the raving crowds!

Probably your first time looking into Bitcoin? Look into it deeper than reddit dude. Yes, the price is taking off - so did Apple &amp; Facebook shares, yet people still buy into these companies today for financial security and profits. Also being developed are solutions to remove most of the traffic from the main blockchain and have transactions completed on a ‘second layer’.  This’ll speed transaction times, lower fees and make running a node (supporting decentralisation) easier for the average punter. Divisiblity has nothing to do with scaling. The majority of “the wealthy” are not even aware of Bitcoin yet. The majority of holders are Gen X &amp; Y tech heads, former darknet users, cypher punks and open minded early adopters. These are the early beneficiaries of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies - not Baby Boomers with heaps of dough!

Or if you've been in longer than that it's a 20% dip from a 250% rise. Just hodl and wait a couple of weeks. You'll be back in the high life again. 
I've seen this situation repeat itself several times now - it's a completely healthy and regular thing to happen to a new global crypto-currency that's in the early stages of taking on the world. 
"This too shall pass" is the mantra for Bitcoin and the decent cryptos with good ideas and programmers behind them (about 5% of the 1000's out there). 
The future is very exciting in this space and we're only still in the sectors' infancy. There's a finite downside - but an almost infinite upside, so hodl and watch a revolution happen from the front seats.

Exactly - centralisation was an anathema to Satoshi. 
Though block increases put a bandaid on the scaling issue in the interim, to pursue that line of thinking means no small decentralised nodes due to costs, mining centralisation and inevitably corporatisation of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. 
BCH can only end up centralised, corporatised and monopolised if you logically follow the evidence. 
Bitcoin by mandating small blocks with layered solutions keeps it democratised, decentralised and in the hands of everyone who wants to support it.

"On paper, the company of Karpeles, called Tibanne, owns about 88% of Mt. Gox as per the WSJ. After the bankruptcy filings are settled, Mt. Gox will be left with a surplus of $977 million worth of bitcoins. Out of that, 88 percent will be granted to Karpeles and in the end, after losing more than $7 billion of user funds, Karpeles will take home $859 million for his role in the demise of Mt. Gox."

Broad community acceptance IS the power behind Bitcoin and its value. Governments have force at their disposal - but we all know, government prohibition eventually fails, and what the community really values will withstand the laws of the state. 
Unless we are from a totalitarian state, the government is limited in what it can do to enforce activities undertaken behind closed doors and under the anonymity of VPNs and TOR as tools. 
These latter two were designed by the government precisely to avoid detection by rogue state actors.

One percent is easily achievable in time. Look at what's happened in the past 12 months. Now imagine five years from now. The price (barring a devastating bug) is going to go bonkers. When EFTs and superannuation funds want to park a few percent of their funds into Bitcoin it'll translate into trillions coming in.

You must sweat a bit though in your darker moments (we all have them) when things can look a little grim with Bitcoin. I mean, $1.2m (current price) is a fuck ton to lose if it all goes to shit. I'm a believer and hodler, but you take faith in maths to a much higher level than us mere earth dwellers.

Shit dude, sounds like you've learnt some shit the hard way. And you came to the idea that hodling is the best strategy! I'm so bloody tempted to slice 20% into alts waiting for the post-fork bounce, but hearing lads like yourself having been burnt and preaching HODL makes me think I'm not smart enough to pull this off...!
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:21:07

Man, I really hope this is one of the big consensus questions in the near future - whether the Core community agrees to moving the Bitcoin decimal place one or two spaces to the right. It'd add a couple of zeros to our balance, and make Bitcoin much more psychologically accessible to the masses.

@_date: 2017-10-27 08:14:17
I explain when this comes up that it looks, and is behaving, like a bubble, but in fact what it is is a massive financial disruptor getting global traction which is instantly reflected in massive price increases. We've never seen anything like this before to reference it with - hence haters insisting that it has to be a bubble because of the price increase that 'resembles' a bubble. It's the democratisation of finance mutha fucka!
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:38:49
Even in a couple of years' time there'll be newcomers to Bitcoin who have only just heard about it. People who buy now will still realise big profits in several year's time - just not of the orders of magnitude of early investors. At the moment I'd guesstimate we're about a half of one percent of the world's population into crypto - what'll happen when that becomes upwards of 5 percent? If someone invested $1,000 today it'd be reasonable to think it'd turn into $10,000 in five years time.

It's all a cosmic birth lottery draw dude. So, I'll take a stab - you're a white, male, live in a highly industrialised, western country and enjoy good health? You're already better off and are in the most opportune position than 90% of all of the current world's inhabitants. You can read &amp; speak English, the world's master language in any forum and could work pretty much anywhere in the world with few real barriers. It's about perspective (I know you have this, you said as much) and looking for positive opportunities- I'm telling you, they're there if you are looking at it the right way. It's generally never too late to better your education/lot in life too.

But isn't it the same argument when Bitcoin went from cents to hundreds of dollars? I think Bitcoin was far more vulnerable when it was a plaything for online fantasy players and went apeshit parabolic. Now there's a massive, professional ecosystem supporting it and if they hodled when they became millionaires recently- what makes you think they'll bail when that becomes tens of millions?
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:43:42

I stumbled upon the simple-as strategy (I'm not a natural high tech/trading literate obviously) and thought really, how can you go wrong putting 20% of my BTC into top alts now, wait for alt bounce post split, watch and pull out at 20-25%. Maybe even 15%, that's good trading in anyone's books (but it's one of those rare 'coin split lead up' opportunities that we don't get very often. Seems it's almost a given that it'll play out this way. From 50% market share to 58% share in a month HAS to fall back to close to previous market share.

But, gold will always have value to people as a "if the shit hits the fan" source of currency should fiat fall on its face. Unless we all go native in this scenario, gold will be seen as a way to carry/use a large store of value that is trusted and revered. Been like that for hundreds of years.

Dude, you're feeling the effects of the crypto roller coaster! Bitcoin is the internet of money and is only just getting its first furtive glances from the world's financial markets. Yes it's mirroring a pump &amp; dump, but what I think we're seeing is the mass adoption of the next new technological protocol that allows you and me (when we have apps that allow us to exchange funds via cell phone pay-wave with each other, and merchants, interchangeably) to be the master of our own financial future. Unless bottoming out 50% for 12 months in the event of a massive adoption issue will break you, you'll most likely regret getting out now. How about sell 30% now if you're that concerned, and that way you've most likely covered all your costs and the rest you're playing with is money for jam?

Can QR codes be useful if you get a bad angle or a partially blocked shot via crashing a media interview?

I've often been amazed that some landlords, to ensure a piddling rent increase, would rather have a property vacant for months - where their total losses are significantly higher than reducing rent in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:47:51
I wonder if it'll play out this way. 
BTC splits into BTC &amp; BCH, with BCH being offered for (let's say) $500 per coin and BTC dropping to around $2000 per coin due to FUD. 
New money sees a chance to get into "Bitcoin" and is encouraged by the potential for massive returns and buys up BCH like hot cakes due to the low comparative price to BTC - pushing it up to maybe $1000 per coin. 
Then, after the dust settles, people will realise BCH has been pumped and investigate further to see the majority of miners &amp; hodlers who are loyal to BTC have remained loyal and BTC rises back to where we're at now, or a new ATH? 
BCH then becomes like ETH or Ripple and is generally regarded as a second tier altcoin.

Precisely Onlino -- ETH is at around 40-50% of BTC's market capitalisation and it's been on the scene for one bloody year. 
Why this isn't the leading topic of discussion here is beyond me? ETH seems to be on a trajectory that seems unstoppable.

But - What is not being articulated here is that we're in early adopter phase of a very new, highly disruptive technology that is stateless, global, infinitely divisible and an increasingly trusted store of value (people are buying $10's of millions of dollars of this stuff at a time - that's not silly money in anyone's books). 
To compare its potential value to stocks traded on stock exchanges (in terms of value &amp; market cap) is like comparing apples with monkey shit.

In the past 50 or so years, yes. 
But in WW1 they'd industrialised warfare to the extent that the total number of military and civilian casualties was more than 38 million: there were over 17 million deaths and 20 million wounded, ranking it among the DEADLIEST CONFLICTS IN HUMAN HISTORY. 
This was only 100 years ago. 
Then in WW2 over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).
Nothing in the previous 1000 years has come even close to this scale of war and carnage. 
Watch out for the what WW3 will bring us.

The issue for me re: BTC v ETH superiority race is that BTC is starting to look sluggish and a poorer facility for commerce in contrast to ETH (I have 95% in BTC) - and in the end I think the wider community wants cryptos to transfer multiple, small amounts very cheap and be technologically nimble. The arguments in the BTC community now must be putting off potential investors towards ETH. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:39:46

^^ This! The decimal point in BTC will have to be moved permanently to the left several places for wide public uptake to occur and ensure its use as a store of value. 
21 million units is just way, way too small a number to deal with world wide recognition and uptake. 
That number isn't even enough for the population of Australia to own one Bitcoin each, let alone global uptake.
