Look, I sound judgmental but I'll try not to be. You're getting a lot of bad advice in this thread. Maybe head to for this - attorneys post there often, and perhaps some of them are familiar with bitcoin.

Ignoring the loose circumstantial evidence and out-of-context quotes from Dorian's family and acquaintances, the only thing we're left with is the "admission," IF we accept that it is honestly reported. I don't.
Her words:


Translation: He did not answer her questions about Bitcoin. Obviously, her first questions had to be along the lines of "Did you invent Bitcoin?" He "categorically" refused to answer. 
My guess: She needed something, anything from him, so she pressed on in rapid-fire to get anything useful before the police escorted her away. Maybe she tried to ask a non-Bitcoin question he *would* answer. Like "Are you still working for the government?" or "Can you confirm that you are still working for Quotron Systems?"
Answer: "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it"
That's not unlikely, if you've ever been around someone who was hounded by press. Reporters are deviously good at getting a quote to use in whatever context they wish. Just implying that they're about to write something incorrect - "can you confirm that you..." is enough to make someone react. Especially if they're implying something that would cause them trouble. Like perhaps that they breached an NDA or revealed classified information.
Anyway, that "admission" quote is unbelievable for another reason. Neither Satoshi nor a mistakenly ID'ed Satoshi would make that statement in regard to Bitcoin at all. Satoshi himself? He's not a stupid man. He knows that people want to find him, so he almost certainly has some notion of how he would handle being confronted about his identity. It seems highly unlikely that he'd blurt out a confession to an annoying *Newsweek* reporter, especially when he was fully aware of her agenda. She'd been talking to this man's family, trying to communicate with him, and then refused to leave until he called the police. It's not like she caught him unaware. 
Furthermore, why would he wait for her to break the story and then deny it? He'd certainly anticipate the media storm, yet we're to believe that this highly private individual would stay put and endure it. And that he'd remain in his unguarded home while being identified as an old man holding the key to hundreds of millions of dollars. That simply didn't happen.
If Dorian were the real Satoshi, even if he'd lost access to his Bitcoins, he'd have sense enough to not be a sitting duck. Whatever action he might take, denying it and hoping it goes away seems like the least likely and least sensible path.

Deep down, everyone who takes the time to tell a Gox victim "I told you so" or "You should have known" and "I have no sympathy" is afraid that *they'll* be the ones on the receiving end one day. They need to believe that people lost because they were stupid and that they themselves are too clever for that. So they take a jab at someone who's down. 
The truth is, Bitcoin investment at this stage is risky and there are many paths to ruin. The jerks making rude posts today may very well be tomorrow's Bitcoin losers. 
So a few points to consider before you leave an ugly reply:
* Even if another Redditor did something stupid, you don't have to post a goddamned thing. Your 20/20 hindsight and snarky comments aren't showing anyone the error of their ways. *The lost money showed them already.* 
* Insulting someone's intelligence and asserting that smart people like yourself saw this coming doesn't make anyone think you're a market genius, it makes you look like an insufferable tool.
* With those posts, you are deliberately trying to hurt and insult an actual human being. To make them feel worse about a bad situation, just because you can. What the living fuck is wrong with you that this seems like a reasonable thing to do? Let me repeat this: you don't have to post a goddamned thing. Your silence will not be considered an endorsement of their decisions.
* Not everyone who lost money fits the nasty little labels I see stuck on them here. "Anyone with money in Gox was either stupid or greedy! Day Traders! Uninformed! Inferior!" Bullshit. There were legitimate reasons to use that exchange, and plenty of well-informed, intelligent people who lost on it. They don't deserve to be categorized and belittled that way.
* Even if some of the victims *were* greedy or less informed, who the fuck cares? Pretty much everyone here hopes to make some money too. Odds are, even the greedy just learned a hard-ass lesson. They don't need dickish remarks to drive it home. 
* The blame here lies squarely with Mt. Gox, not the victims. Who's an idiot? Karpeles. Who's fault is it? His. Remember that.

Let me get this straight:
* A random internet stranger offered to give you just shy of $10,000 to buy Litecoins for them.
* You asked them to send it in $1000/day increments specifically to circumvent banking regulations (though you had no idea that it was tainted money, right?)
* You laundered the funds by purchasing bitcoin, trading for litecoin, taking a cut and sending the remaining funds back to your new friend. 
* And you don't think you should be responsible for that.
The fact that you knew the legal limit and took action on behalf of the scammer to circumvent it makes you very much responsible for the amount. Had the transfer been flagged on day 1, it is possible that the bank would have questioned and stopped it before anyone lost their money. But because you handed the thief laundered money, he is very unlikely to be caught. 
Your "I'm but a simple man with little money, seeking to buy an engagement ring for my love" story rings hollow in many ways. 
* You [post advertising that you sell litecoin](
* But you've got a "[collection of loyal trustworthy buyers]( for your litecoin operation.
* Yet you've [posted about being scammed recently another way]( and now this?
* And [boast about doubling mined coins by making fast trades on exchange rates](
But you're just a naive victim who had no idea that he was laundering money for criminals. That's not why you broke it down into daily increments that wouldn't flag your bank's security alerts. Right.
