Other subs keep banning me. They can't face the truth that Big Daddy will live on 1000 years from now. When we get there, 1 BTC will be one of the rarest digital relics in the world. It will be priceless. You go to a museum, turn on a ledger nano and see 1 BTC on balance, now worth as much as South Korea itself. 2 BTC circulating supply, everything else lost on dead wallets. My grand grand grand grand x10 son will be holding the other BTC (the remaining I'll invest in hookers and cocaine).
Don't upvote me.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:45:26
They all tried.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:44:38
They can't take the truth.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:32:49
I need some post and comment karma to defend big daddy on other subz.
They keep banning me.

Because on december 2018 I will look back to this day and think "That was my chance of buying low".
Total crypto market cap = 430 billions USD. This is half of a single US company. It's going back up and it will pass 1 trillion. Easiest money of my life. As soon as the bull run stops on Dow Jones we are back in the game. Until there, BTC could fall to 5k I won't give a shit.

WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:02:18
LOL. Yeah, sell everything. That's what the Wall Street snobs are waiting so they can buy cheap and play the game back to a ATH by 2019. Bitcoin is banned from all countries, cryptos are gone, nevermind thousand people still working on the tech that is so new. SELL NOW, MAKE IT GO TO 3K TO ACTIVATE MY BUY ORDERS. PANIC, FEAR AND SELL. NEVER GOING BACK UP AGAIN. ONLY DOWN. BTC WILL BE WORTH NEGATIVE DOLLARS IN 2018 AND YOU DON'T WANT TO OWN DOLLARS TO BIG DADDY. LOL, if you guys were here last year I bet you would have made this same post. One less weak hand. Now that you sold please help me spread more FUD about cryptos, need to make BTC all the way down to 3k. If this buy order is filled I'll donate 1 BTC to whoever helps spreading the FUD. People are already desperate, just a little FUD is enough for 3k, don't stop with this post, keep going please.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:37:59
It's ok, I'm waiting for 3 - 5 k to buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:55:15
It's good for people not to max they credit card on cryptos. If they need credit for cryptos that means its also not a good thing. Very volatile. Some noobs can't handle.

Bitcoin can be coded, just takes some time. Check: 
First six places are coins without working products. Bitcoin is here for years and years still 7th most active Github. You fool.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:32:32
LOLz, so many noobs and weak hands, I think this post just dropped BTC price by about 5 dollas. A few more posts and we are down to 3k. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:18:24
Never considered BTC an investment. I bought BTC because I wanted to own BTC. I'll still own it 20 years from now.
Edit: I also spend BTC as well, bought a nice gaming laptop last week. Worth. Bought a new bike for myself for crhistmas, this shit pays dividends.

As long as people are buying / selling it and using it to purchase goods its not worthless. It's actually a real thing and you can't make it go away because it's decentralize.

If you bought BTC to make money you lost. I bought BTC to use it in case fiat gets fucked. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:16:41
If you consider BTC = invest then you are wrong in the first place. Get out of here. BTC = BTC. All things shall pass and BTC will still be here. BTC will be here after your dead bro. Sorry for your losses.

So you destroy US power grid and 10 nerds in Japan are still keeping BTC alive. I guarantee, BTC will be here in 100 years and you won't.

Let me tell you a story you fucking weak hands. It's about my grandpa and my grandma. 
Grandpa was a visionary. Bought Amazon stocks couple weeks after the first issue at ATH. Grandpa thought he had made the best decision ever. As you all know, It was a bubble and the market crashed. Grandpa kept his stock certificates anyway.
Fast foward 10 years grandpa bought his first lambo. Did granpa sell when everyone said "BUBBLE"? No. Did grandpa spread more fud over the internet after everyone said "BUBBLE"? No. Now which grandpa was left with a lambo? MY GRANDPA. PROBABLY NOT YOURS.
So, I just sold grandpa's old lambo and moved my fiat to Coinbase. A little more fud from your noobs and I'll grab those BTC at 3 - 5k and then I'll spread those over some ETH, NEO and other projects that will still be around in 5 years.
So please, call you grandpa now, he will tell you to sell, sell the shit out of those BTC, make it drop to 3k so my order gets filled and I'll send you all a pic of my lambo in 5 years from now. 
All this FUD will be forgotten in a few months. And I'll frame a fucking screenshot of me buying BTC at 3k in 2018 you fucking morons.

How am I buying at 3k if you keep HODLING? SELL NOW! PANIC! FEAR IS HERE!
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:19:58
NASDAQ = ponzi? Dot com = ponzi? You should recheck history boy.
EDIT: actually, just check Amazon's price chart before, during and after the "bubble". Too bad humans have such short sight. Anyway, I'm not in BTC for the money. I don't think how much my BTC are worth in USD or whatever currency. I just know how many BTC I have and it is always there for me.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:07:35
You mean USD backed by air?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:27:36

Some chinese miner will be there. OR I can exchange my BTC for a castle or a city or classic pussy and cocoine.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:48:17
I still have my dogs and my Russian wife. They are on sale on craiglist though so I can buy BTC at 3k.
