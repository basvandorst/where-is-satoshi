My primary job,  that is what I do nearly 100% of the time is bitcoin.: either mining, trading, selling, etc.  Ive been at it since the beginning when btc sold for under $8 ea.
Bitcoin is hard to buy because that is its very nature.  Bitcoin is cold hard cash - you loose it, or it gets stolen, its gone forever.   There is no way to call it back.  In that respect, bitcoin is worse than fiat cash money because there nothing physical about it.  just a number on a electronic ledger on your computer screen.
In the US, the absolute easiest way  to get bitcoin is with Circle.  It amazes me every time i use it.  No waiting, no fees, and you pay market price.  You receive your bitcoins INSTANTLY.  Not 20 minutes, not 3 minutes, I mean instantly.  What a fantastic service; they will put BTC in mainstream america.  I love Circle.  I am surprised they aren't in the UK.  
In Europe there are a couple of exchanges that should be an easy SEPA bank transfer from your checking account.  The newest one is EXMO  and also one of the oldest, Bitstamp.  I never liked Local bitcoins because I hate paying fees.  Buy from an exchange and get the market rate with no fees.  I used Virwox not too long ago, that option is still available.

I have been working with BTC-e since they opened.  Its just their culture that gives us that "shady feeling".   They do have an attitude that says "I own this exchange and you should thank me for allowing you to trade here.  You better not break anything.  And dont bother me unless its really important".
However, they are NOT thieves.  nor scammers.   I used to have the same thing happen to me all the time when depositing perfect money.  Go through the process and yet no money in my btc-e account.  
Just log a very sweet &amp; nice support ticket and they will take care of you Monday morning.

oh man, i am so sorry that happened to you.  Reading that felt like someone kicked me right between the legs.   I am also saving up for a S9 and it would really suck if i lost that money.  I cant think of any recourse other than the double spend that was already  suggested.

I am a miner.  The fee we are talking about is less than $1- even if you want your transaction processed first, its still less than $1 usually, the most I've seen is $3.  
Years from now when there is no more block reward, this fee is the only way miners will get paid.   Miners have huge costs of electricity - my electric bill runs  $11,000 /month.  we have to receive adequate compensation   As the block reward goes to zero, transaction fees will increase.

Circle is the best.  pay with credit/debit card, get coins instantly with no fees.
Hardware wallets are for people who cant keep up with their private key.  I dont get it, what is better about a hardware wallet over say a paper wallet??  especially if you are going to just hold BTC...

I guess my point was, if one fully understands the wallet, what it is  and how it works, it make hardware wallets seem silly.  
If you want to carry a piece of hardware, get a cheap usb stick and encrypt your private key before  before saving on the stick.  Cost alot less than $100.

The bitcoin network has exceeded its capacity. It cannot process all the transactions quick enough.  There is a huge backlog of transactions
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:18:39
BTC network is over capacity.  it can keep up

My ROI is about 3 months.   I signed up for a new rate offered by my power company that gives me below 0.02 (2 cents) per KWH.

I have been preaching this exact same sermon for years, even the part about a million dollar bitcoin.   I have spewed this speech hundreds of times just counting the ubers and taxi drivers.  I always ask, "have you ever heard of bitcoin? No? Its a currency, just like dollars and euro's......
Yet, only a few people actually took the time to google it and bought some.  I tell friends, "just get $50-100 dollars worth, I'll put it in a paper wallet for you and you can put it in your safety deposit box and forget about it.   When you retire, it will be worth more than your 401k, IRA, etc. combined.

It would be cool if he really is Nakamoto
