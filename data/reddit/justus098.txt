You’re welcome. And I think so to,
The next Bull run will be history in the making!
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:22:35
Guess you aren’t buying anymore then.

Finished!!!!! ����
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:54:26
Buy again bro just eat the fee..and HODL. You’ll be fine.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:17:14
You don’t need to ask us. Just buy some more my friend. Besides 9300 is low compared to what’s to come. Buy some bitcoin relax and enjoy your Sunday.

Some can’t see the forest for the trees I guess..
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:43:20

@_date: 2019-06-10 20:17:47

I started off on robinhood. Buy and move away from a exchange. Just a opinion. As far as your question I have no idea.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:09:10
Better question for the LTC development team.

Never trade hodl. Be patient and don’t sell on emotion or fear.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:05:45
Man I hope not, but I guess it was a matter of time before the mega corporations got their hands on this. Might be good for Bitcoin in terms of public awareness though. Who knows?
@_date: 2019-04-20 20:41:35
Alright alright alright! ��
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:56:03
Stay away from Robinhood when buying crypto.

“Like best they can do is get double their money back”
  If you honesty think BTC will top out at 16,000 you’re a moron. We haven’t seen nothing yet, this train hasn’t even left the station yet!
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:55:59
That’s a sound strategy. I like your style!
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:38:42
I agree completely! They will use a “terrorist” attack or anything to make bitcoin look bad and anti-American.  The powers that be are good at building blind patriotism in this country.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:34:16
Not yet.... Give it time, humanity never fails to disappoint.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:08:33
I know right! We’ve heard this before I won’t believe it until I see it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:57:59
Why would anyone sell BTC right now unless they were absolutely starving??
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:32:16
That’s why everyone needs a hard wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:19:33
Personally I don’t believe it matters right now. Buy buy buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:19:40
Same here I wasn’t sure why.
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:36:25
It’s will be mainstream in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:06:39
Yep!
