As a buyer @ $4k and seller @ $19.5 I see these people saying btc is about to rally to $30k as frankly stupid. As soon as btc lost the ability to be used as a currency its intrinsic value crashed to zero and its actual value crashed to around $11k. If scaling cannot be fixed then it’s dead and won’t get anywhere near $30k let alone back to the ATH

I think due to the events of the last 72 hours and the network issues that bitcoin is facing we won’t see the growth we were all expecting until these issues are resolved. If bitcoin was still performing cheap and instant transactions worldwide I believe we would be closer to 50k than 10k as such we are meeting a point closer to its intrinsic value.. not because the price has gone up but because the utility has come down. 
That being said it is still easily capable of 20k and 25k. They might just be a few weeks away.

Yeh good question, I bought and sold it based on its merits as a commodity at the time. Fees and wait times were too high so I sold because I didn’t believe in it anymore. Never on market sentiment. 
I’m seeing good progress all the time recently. I’ve moved a lot of my liquidity into shares and am starting to build up again. I told myself I’d get back in if we ever got back to my average startup cost which was $5k. So I think I’ll stick with that as my buyin point for round two .
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:28:48
Try telling that to the idiots on here. They literally all just want everyone else to buy it so they can drive it up to sell it off again. Bitcoin failed its mainstream test at 20k and will do so again if it approaches the same capacity. You can’t bullrun if the technology can’t facilitate it ��
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:19:25
TO ME it’s $5k. Being deflationary and moderately transactable and the first of its type in existence is pretty huge and to me warrants the price tag. If it maintains is flexibility as a currency as adoption increases its value will go up too. It just needs to not fall apart at $20k again. Lightning and segwit are great. I suspect they aren’t enough though. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:14:51
Well the current inherent value of BTC to me is about $5k right now. There is still a lot of positives to the technology. Problem in January was when the inherent value plunged right before the actual value. It’s just been catching up all this time. Get it to $5k then start ramping it again and get it into the media and then to bull run will start again.

@_date: 2018-11-30 23:07:55
I’ll bite. We tapped into a large market of fringe enthusiasts to bring us up to $20k, at which point the blockchain infrastructure fell apart causing high fees and long confirmation times. 
(Someone well versed in lightning network - are we at risk of this occurring again if we had the same traffic this time last year?) 
So we burned those enthusiasts and at the same time we vindicated the view of the haters and mum and dad investors who swore it was going to crash. 
There is an all time low amount of vendors accepting payments in bitcoin and the currency has become a bit of a joke due to this and even the most diehard communities only seem to care about price. 
A lot of stars have to align for us to break into old and new markets. Some people will NEVER come back after losing a lot of wealth - after so many before them had built wealth. 
August 2019 $4500
August 2020 $4900
August 2021 $6100
August 2022 $8800
August 2023 $5900
August 2024 $6800
August 2025 $11,000

With the amount of people and transactions taking place by then, the block reward from fees will dwarf the black reward making new coins. There will be a tipping point somewhere where the fee payment overtakes the reward. I read it's 2140 the expected date of the last block reward. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:52:34

Satoshi wasn't Jesus. He had an idea then fucked off and a lot of other more dedicated people took over. 
Secondly just because a bitcoin costs a lot more dosent lower the barrier to entry. With price swings predicted up to $25k each coin, owning a fraction of a coin NOW is going to be like what owning 10,000 coins were like in 2009. 
I agree centralised exchanges aren't necessarily a good thing, but they increase penetration and reliability. So they may be a necessary evil. Bitcoin wouldn't have been able to grow to what it has by P2P transactions. I'm sorry, that's the truth. It has evolved into a much better system than the white paper envisaged.

Those are the exchanges, whatever you buy it'll be fine. Buy 0.1 or buy 10 whatever you want.

Exact opposite for me. I bought too many shitcoins, my wallet didn't give me an accumulated portfolio value and I had to use windows calculator to see how much money I had.

The more you put in the more you stand to gain (and lose, but tbh. Look at the graph). Dollar cost average $100 a week if you want and keep a few k at the exchange in fiat when a dip happens. You don't want to miss or on the cheaper coins when you have that chance.

You know why. Bitcoin is at its core a pyramid scheme. Early adopters get better reward the more people join up. If I get 10 people in and they each get 10 people in. I might be responsible for pumping an extra $100k into the system. 
Of course any of these people can then exchange BTC for goods and services or just hodl like investors might with their fiat. 
And instead of the bank giving interest, the value of the asset rises. How good is that! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:43:19

It may dip again, but without significant FUD coming out of US legislation I don't know we'll ever see a crash. And if we did there would be so many hungry investors (including Wall Street by now) who would buy up so fast a crash would be corrected within 12 hours.

Bitcoin increased by $1000 in 24 hours last week. Your $1000 might only get you .20 of a bitcoin. But if it goes up by $1000 in a day YOU still get $200. With the severity of fluctuations these days it dosent matter if you don't hold an entire bitcoin. .2 of a bitcoin is the 200 bitcoins of 2009.

Bitcoin is a finite asset immune to inflation that's only owned by .002% of the population. As word spreads and more people buy and get on board the demand will go up while he supply stays the same. Realistically there is no way of predicting this down to the $ on the day. But barring any global catastrophe or malignant legislation by a country like the USA or Japan bitcoin will indeed rise in value.

I hodl only BTC. But a lot of people trade alts. Some people only hold 5% of their portfolio in btc. I know a lot of people have consolidated their holdings into JUST btc in time to register for the fork then go back to alt trading with the btg from hodling on the 25th 
So my expectation is there will be a dip after the 25th. But then how many other people are in same boat as me with money in the exchange ready to buy said dip. It just as easily might moon tighter AFTER the dip. So who knows really.

Not by the literal definition no.. but the fact that the system grows as more people at lower levels are convinced to join and the earlier you adopted the exponential your gains get as more people come on board at the lower levels.

Predictions in the context of crypto currency mean nothing. People give reasons for a dip, which could just as easily be a reason for a price run. 
Dollar cost average. If you have $10k to invest put $1k in every week, that way if the price goes down you can take advantage and if it soars you'll have some to take to the moon with you .

My thoughts.. what legal precedent could they have for outright banning it? I mean they can say it's being used to fund terrorism.. but fiat has been funding terrorism fairly well for the last 2 decades. I see any move changing the criminal status of BTC as highly disingenuous tbh. As well as being economically stupid.

Enough to retire with a bit to play with. If I keep acquiring I might be able to do that with $500k a coin.

Depends on the adoption rate and the institutional response. If adoption goes up to 5/10% of the population and it makes it into the portfolios of hedge funds and investment banks. We could see $50k a coin. Much higher than that and we'd be looking at a global market paradigm shift and I don't think that's likely in our lifetime

How are bitcoins risky? If you look at a graph the history lesson is hodl the coins and treat it like a currency and historically you were become wealthy. 
Sure anything COULD happen, but it hasn't. Anything COULD happen to any bank or financial instrument. I don't personally see bitcoin as risky anymore because of the building numbers of people who have adopted it.

It's because they didn't HODL. If btc loses 90% of its value all of a sudden I know myself and a LOT of other people will dive onto its corpse to try and scoop up as many coins at 10% of it's current value $580ish. Sounds good to me.

Bitcoin is a finite asset immune to inflation that's only owned by .002% of the population. As word spreads and more people buy and get on board the demand will go up while he supply stays the same. Realistically there is no way of predicting this down to the $ on the day. But barring any global catastrophe or malignant legislation by a country like the USA or Japan bitcoin will indeed rise in value.

I suspected there could be a dip right after the hard fork. So I put some fiat in the exchange to be able to switch it over if/when it goes down. If after the fork it's the same as before I'll just buy at the ATH like I did last time. That's my current game plan. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:00:25
Hal finney and nick szabo has always been my bet. Just use the pseudonym of SN to spearhead all the stuff, use his account one at a time and exchange emails with the one who wasn't in the SN account. Then the decline with HF's health and erasing or trashing the coins around that time. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:22:46
It'll drop after the fork, but not to below 4500, there will be a bit of pressure around the 5000 mark again as people consolidate and sell etc. Then slow predictable growth up to a finish of 2017 around 6500-7000.

If amazon accepted bitcoin yes there would be an upward trend in price. It's utility as a currency would be far greater and as amazon increase their reach globally they would take that influence with them. Amazon are key to helping the penetration of btc as a currency.

The point he's making is that historically bitcoin only ever goes up. Nothing seems to suggest this will stop so it dosent really matter how much you buy and when. The result will be the same. So

Why do you have true belief? I bought in in 2016/2017 after that Netflix documentary was popularised and I doubled down on reading about blockchain and it’s used etc. Bought the Bitcoin because I thought the technology had the potential to replace a traditional fiat system. 
Then in December 2017 when Bcash started spamming the mempool and the fees and confirmation times went up. It simulated for me what a mainstream bitcoin adoption would look like.
From that moment on I’ve steered well clear. I sold when I started to see the technology struggle, which was incidentally the ATH. I’ve seen improvements in Segwit and lightning. But I truely have zero faith that the system will be able to deal with the traffic required to get into the reserve currency bracket.
Don’t hodl. Sell.
