False. If the price never reaches its previous high again or even comes close, then there's clear proof it was a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:50:53
I'd worry. Zoom out and see that a ridiculous run up in value coinciding with everybody and their mother getting in for "fear of missing out" clearly should give ANYBODY pause. Bubble. This is something that intrinsically has no value, driven by hordes of people who have no clue what the hell they're even doing, driven by this irrational thought that everybody is going to make millions! Recent history shows that our dreams of funding a retirement on Beanie Babies didn't exactly work out...
Good luck, guys. Hope your Asian counterparts don't lose interest or those countries don't regulate trading. Your money is tied to people mainly in Asia also without a clue of what they're getting into. Sell now and run away.

Seriously, take this to heart. You're an investing novice I take it? No shame, we all start somewhere. Whatever you do, DO NOT just jump into this. Do your research. Learn investing 101. Read the related subreddits for information. If you just jump in expecting to make a ton of money, you're going to get burned. Badly. 
This isn't "somewhat" of a low. This is NOT cheap. This could still be considered massively overvalued. And remember, past performance is no indication of future success. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:26:38
And it could be down 30% tomorrow. A single up or down day doesn't indicate a damn thing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:45:34
Yeah, sure. Keep believing that bitcoin will be  forever and that the masses that propped up the value will always be interested.

Who is rich? Unless you've cashed out, and especially in December, you're not rich. Do you even own a whole coin? And define rich? I'm willing to say that there is NOBODY commenting here that is "rich" from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:14:07
How does what feel? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:01:40
A tiny percentage increase. No comparison. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:44:37


You've come out way ahead. If you want to take a profit, do it while you can. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:36:02


Enron was never listed on the Dow average. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:00:11
Cool, man. And you lost 60% of your value today since you weren't smart enough to cash out in December. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:13:55
Me? No thank you. But seriously, OP. Be smart and take the profit while you can.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:17:17
Who the hell cares? 8K. Wow. Still more than 50% off from ATH. The fact you guys literally obsess over the price minute by minute shows that none of you should even have any money invested in this crap. You're all going to get burned if this is how you treat things.

I never got in the game. I'm just here for my daily dose of laughter from the absurdity of these threads. It's good entertainment. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:43:08
I know, right? I'm only here to laugh at all these morons who will end up broke while thinking they're going to be filthy rich from bitcoin. They haven't the slightest clue about investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:07:23
Yeah, sure you do. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:53:26

Yeah, spending TONS of these coins that literally have no value is a smart move. Here's my told you so: all of these will be driven useless by future technology and newer coins with faster and cheaper processing times. None of these are viable long term. Also, you earn no interest from holding these, you earn no dividends, they don't do anything... not backed by anything...why in god's name would anyone think this is a great investment strategy? If you think buying now is a good idea, you're crazy. You're a year too late my friend. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:43:43


Oh, shut up. He took a real gain. You'll probably be the one holding the bag once this thing dies. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:28:42
Yeah, you see what Wall Street did today? Let the panic selling of any investment assets begin...
