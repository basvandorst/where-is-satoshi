Imo they were always kinda biased.

ZeroHedge, totally trustworthy.

Sheesh, it's not like most people here agree with capitalism, am I right?

Every single crash.

I disliks any kind of gov.,  but honestly,  bringing neocon media instead of the communist one won't help anyone there.  Bitcoin's message is valid,  the government position is not.

Seems friendly enough for me.

Such pure ethic, I wonder why are you caring about a currency.
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:10:36
WJS typical printing.

Maybe he accepts bitcoins as purchasing power of the land?

If you really care about that, voluntary work would help you more.

If I gained one cent for every time I listen that from goldtards, I'd be inflation-proof forever.

I love how people attack him for being 'a liberal' yet can't really prove why his videos are bad. They are not, they are at worst informative. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:38:44
He mostly is, he has some political agenda behind him (of course), but most of his videos are well balanced opinions, specially on important issues that are money or health related. Good to see a piece from him on Bitcoin.

Who said he's leftist? I'm not and I can still find most of the people on the right pretty childish compared to literally all other ideology userbases here on reddit.

This. It's normal that most people don't "believe" TA works, because they don't even know what that is.

It was sarcastic, should I place a /s so you can find out? Of course you are not an economist, you believe in praxeology. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:59:35
Wat what? Praxeology is the homeopathy of economics.  
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:01:55
**Ha.** Said the economist, go figure man.
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:22:48
Said the guys who believe in Praxeology! That's a **fucking** irony.
