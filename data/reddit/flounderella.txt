Yep that's pretty intuitive to understand for someone new to the ledger

This is ridiculous ... Noobs are of course welcome here, so please stop spreading useless fud.

Isnt it time then for them to buy buy buy before its harder to buy ... I'm sure they'll find a way around it, fly to Macau or HK to buy or do it in person but still...
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:17:42
Yeah, that's what I would think. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:17:22
There are tons of great pools out there. Spread the hash folks!
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:41:28
Aww why thank you :D ...burp

A truly global currency. For once we can start breaking down barriers across the globe. If we ever do run into aliens and go intersteller, bitcoin will be the currency for our planet

This is a textbook test and hold of the 1 year moving average at 350-360ish. I call a bottom.

So much fud about China

If the only reason people mine at Ghash is the lack of fees, let me point out that Eligius also has no fees. And its payout algorithm is similar to pps and very fair. Yes the website aint the greatest but only noobs would refresh a pool page every 5 min to see if the payout is moving or not. If you've been mining as long as I have (2 years now), let me tell you it doesn't matter. A good pool would always average (and sometimes better) than the calculated BTC payout for a difficulty level.

Good suggestion but while refusing new registrations may help at the margin, there are only so many miners out there. In most cases, its just an existing miner pointing a new Antminer to some pool (which can happen to be ghash.io). There are also other good pools though which don't charge fees if that's important (e.g. eligius)

Was only a matter of time

So is the professtor going to buy his own hat to eat or do we all pool together to create a fund to buy a hat for him to eat ... when bitcoin goes above $1000 by end of this year.

Thanks Gavin

Any formal response from coinbase yet, either tweet or blog post?
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:22:48
I guess they never really intended to fully ban it; just trying to reduce their future liability ... basically "lawyers made us do it" kinda thing
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:36:05
Who's dumping? Chinese?

Nice clean breakout of downward channel on the daily chart. Next step is 700 in a few days

Is this the Citigroup that just can't get its act together?
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:27:18
awww, sorry to hear ... but yes it will be okay in the bigger picture
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:17:44
Ghash is pretty attractive for its no fee policy. But there are plenty of good pools out there, so please spread the hash around.

Is Ripple still alive? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:15:37
A lot of sad stories here. I wish you guys all the best and hope you find the strength and courage to get past this. I want to say I lost out too with Gox but really the amounts here are so staggering that my 10BTC trading account amounts to nothing.
At the end of the day, money is just money. We are not going to live forever, so I wish you the strength to remember the most cherished things in your life and hold them close and find solace there.

10 bucks+ per gh... no thank you. You'll not get any ROI on a price over $3-4 per gh, max. Even 4 is pushing it because you are assuming difficulty jumps will be below average (i.e. under 15%). Use a calculator and see for yourself. At this price, you are better off buying BTC outright. If you are doing as a hobbyist, go with an antminer s1 which you own and run
