Who will "take care" of the miner incentive problem while the rest of us are enjoying the wonderful benefits of no-face-value colored coins?

If these grams of gold over here with these serial numbers are equivalent to shares of xyz corperation, and those grams of gold over there are equivalent to the deed of a certain property, then i don't want gold, i want very specific molecules of gold.

I know every gpu in china is trying a trillion brain wallets every second, but what's wrong with a gold old fashioned 10-word brain wallet?

Makes sense. essentially money has to be something that can't be easily "made", and therefore is scarce.

Someone would start a new email protocol that's equally useful and eventually it'd be a race to zero, the "price" of using the protocol would be the price of keeping the blockchain running...just like there's a price to keeping Gmail running (electricity).

Seems akin to buying paper pulp when there were rumblings about the adoption of paper money instead of coins. At first sure you could probably sell the pulp to the mint, and maybe there was a pulp-craze, but at the end of the day it's just pulp.

Interesting. so does the fact that the empty block is then included in the longest chain mean that miner was wrong and his version was good to begin with?

Thanks. So this CME news is less about the impact to the market cap of Bitcoin and more about the legitimacy/facilitating more risk mitigation that can allow for larger btc investments

outrage against anonymous silicon? seems like this kind of move would be exploited

Ah I see. So there's some kind of logic program running where if another block is found within x time of me finding my block, then shove it out empty and hope for the best?

let's say 100 GH/s

so what is their incentive to include transactions in the block? wouldn't it propagate faster with less data in it?

$100B total market cap. Lol. The nasdaq 100 grew by 2x that amount of value on this past Friday alone.
