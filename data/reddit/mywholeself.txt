Ha ha ha! Normalizing theft, that's rich! 
There has never been a first world country without extensive social programs and associated taxation. Full stop. From ancient Rome to modern social democracies, like the United States, *socialism has universally won*. And countries that do it more/better, like Northern Europe, are winning more. Like anything, it can be done poorly or well.

The entire frame of reference of your post is valuation in first currency. That alone should speak to the success of first currency 
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:25:34
Yeah but yuan would that ever happen?

But when you get paid for your "profit", shouldn't you just turn around and do it again?

I'm a mobile developer. And Windows phones failed for far less obvious reasons. 
Basically Microsoft shafted their developers repeatedly, until nobody wanted to play anymore. First they had Windows Mobile, which dominated for years. And then they came out with Windows Phone and Silverlight, which they pushed everybody to adopt, shafting all the developers who'd invested in Windows Mobile (which, at the time, was HUGE in corporate America) 
But then, just as developers were getting settled on Silverlight, BAM! Windows phone 8 came out, and guess what? It didn't support Windows Phone 7 nor did it support Windows Mobile. 
At this point, all remaining talent quit and went to iOS/Android. And now, even though Microsoft was literally trying to pay developers to write their own apps for Windows Mobile, nobody's taking the money and their marketplace is a cesspool of "me too", first year CS students, and spam apps. It's terrible and MS can't even filter out the crap because they so desperately need(ed?) to get their app counts up. 
I don't even know: does Microsoft still sell Windows phone? 
EDIT: It appears they do. Or at least, I can buy Windows Phones.

I wonder - is there a market for running your own node at a data center? Figure a basic 1U server running Linux preconfigured with all the necessary software at about $75/month... 
I have all the infrastructure to make it happen if so.

... avoiding the fact that taxes are voluntary; you can choose to live in a country (EG: Somalia) with no effective tax rate or governance. Oh what's that? You *like* living in places with effective social democracy in place? 
Hmm. 
Also nice trick not addressing the *rest* of the quote. See: Logical Fallacy, non sequitur

I think you missed something fundamental. But maybe that's just me. 
I remember him emphasizing putting money on things that give a return over things that don't and using weird language like "pay yourself first" so maybe that's where the confusion is?

Spam callers spoof their number all the time. I'll miss a call, call back, and get some frazzled guy on the phone who has been getting flooded by call backs for something he had nothing to do with.

Note that the properties that make an asset a good store of value don't particularly lend well to being a good currency. Assets that appreciate over time, as many feel Bitcoin will do, disincentivize people who hold that ass up from spending it like currency. 
One of the values that fiat currency offers is inflation! Managed well, inflation incentivizes people to spend their money, keeps the velocity of money hi, and this boosts the economy. I feel like, as a currency, something like manna is probably the best bet. 
Bitcoin May well end up as a default Value Store. Certainly, that's how people are using it now..

This is a common misnomer. They are not limited to cash on hand.  *[Banks commonly borrow the money they lend from a central bank exchange or the Fed](

Anybody who banks with self respect does not Wells Fargo! Get a decent bank. I have loved how Rabobank has been, they are careful stewards of my money. I keep a lot in their hands. For International travel I've heard good things about HSBC service but I've also seen some shenanigans so I'm hesitant. 
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Banks I've learned to avoid:
* Wells Fargo
* Bank of America
* US Bank

When I bought my ES 350 the alternative was a BMW 5. But... I wanted a car that would last a while. 
Why would I want a BMW then?

But, like Reddit, they do. They filter adult content, calls to assassinate, suicide videos, and plenty of other "undesirable" content. The truth is that there is a huge, dark, never talked about army of souls who have the job of "sanitizing" our internet.

Federal government doesn't fund K-12 schools. States do. Also, most of the "unfunded" social aid isn't owed, but predicted. As in future costs for living people projected to be paid by future taxes.

Having written such a "shitskull" bot, about a year ago, and observing the precise timing of the market with simple moving averages (7/28) and then watching that timing collapse when the FTC began investigating, I have to ask if it really was such a shitskull bot after all. 
Ever notice that comments about "barting" have largely disappeared?
It's easy to criticise, but it's hard to get right. What do you suggest?

Interesting read. Indeed, PoW algorithms *can* reduce the effect of a DoS attack by inverting the natural computational disparity that exists between one server and thousands of clients. Or even between one client, a demanding server request, and holding down Ctl-R! I might even implement something like this...
The Crux of utility is whether a response to a PoW request can be cheaply validated...
EDIT: In the context of web based client/server architecture.
EDIT2: I currently use 1 time tokens to prevent DoS type activity but not ideal.
