Congratulations. Just send me the 12 or 24 mnemonic word phrase for your ledger hardware wallet and I'll send you your winnings, i promise. ;)

At some point I'd like to avoid getting called dumb or an idiot in this sub. Is there a special ceremony or something where one swears allegiance to get accepted into the inner circle of special r/bitcoin users?
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:30:41
Haha funny -- today is Sept 1 not April 1.
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:08:37
Fair call. I shouldn't have just repeated myself like that.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:04:14
What the hell happened to 90%?! Zoom out just bit there on the chart.
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:42:39
What's the name of your node? Can I open a channel with it?
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:57:44
How is it my fault/problem when blocks are full? Unless, of course, your saying people using BTC is the problem.
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:02:56
Unlucky, got blindsided by a surge in the mempool -- just not my day.
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:54:28
Thank you. Glad to see that there is at least one r/Bitcoin redditor that also sees the problem and understands my frustration.
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:52:30
Cool. Looks really nice. What algo/coin you mine?
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:34:52
Yeah, I'm the idiot and you are so smart? Check the mempool right now -- to attempt a guaranteed next block could require 200 sats/byte. It still wouldn't guarantee it.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:39:37
Hold your BTC -- spend your BCH instead.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:06:34
I'm not the troll or shill here, I'm a frustrated user of BTC. If the devs aren't allowed to hear the complaints and frustrations from users, then how the hell are they going to be able to fix the real problems?: [
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:07:13
Sensational. Why so much echo?
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:23:15
Obviously the user's fault -- just bury your head.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:23:54
Obviously the user's fault -- just bury your heads.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:52:34
I'm working on that.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:09:33
Bad weather again today:  r/ 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:18:44
BTC is now a heap of shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:27:00
Thank you for understanding. I'll certainly be more careful next time. But, still there is a problem with blocks regularly getting full.
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:40:46
Okay, it looks to be online now. But, I tried again and now it says: "Data loss protection is not provided by this peer", and then closes. Still not letting me open a channel. Any clues how to fix that error?
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:30:49
Did I say something wrong?
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:05:52
I used 6 sats/byte with 10 inputs and a single output. 3 hours ago, 6 sats was considered a high fee, now Trezor is recommending 14 sats/byte. Trezor doesn't support RBF. At this point there is nothing more I can do other than express my frustrations and wait my turn.
No, I don't always just "complain like an infant" -- I'm expressing my frustrations.
As a regular BTC user this issue is a real problem. The BTC community ought to wake up!!!   
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:18:08
When will a BTC full node run on the Samsung Galaxy S9?
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:35:22
Dammit!!! I selected high fees and I use Trezor! What the hell more should I have done!!!
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:10:03
Why do you think they couldn't? What if they had?
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:07:17
Wow. Interesting that you received the same call. I didn't know whether to believe it when he was telling me about it.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:58:18
Yes, please read my comment history and see that I actually think for myself.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:07:43
Cool! I'll open a channel with your new node.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:21:16
Wow! All the hate! r/btc and the BCH community is a much friendlier place to hang.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:17:50
I see your node in the network search. However, I'm getting the following error when I try to connect: "Could not connect to remote peer at IPv4(/83.99.142.174,9735)". Is your node still online right now?
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:07:35
When the blocks get full, people will suffer. Think about it, if everyone doubles the estimated fee, then they still have to wait. It doesn't fix the real problem.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:28:02
Maybe, you already understand this, but I'll try to explain how I see pruning. As there are a few different theories on pruning, I'll discuss the one regarding saving space. Other than using incorrect keys, there are two scenarios that break the transaction consensus rules 1) trying to spend a transaction (input) that never existed. 2) trying to spend a transaction input that was previously spent.  So it's the same result whether the input never existed or its already spent. So, once an input is spent it can simply be forgotten by a mining nodes. This is because it's the same state as it never existing. Really all that a mining node's goal is to have it's next block accepted by all other mining nodes. Being that the only thing allowed is properly spending unspent transaction inputs, nodes only will include and/or accept the spending of unspent transactions, anything else would get ignored or rejected. So the mining nodes don't need to keep track of old spent transactions because they are meaningless to them. If it's not in their unspent transaction list it's rejected. Now, there will always be a need to have copies of the entire blockchain available for new nodes to verify and get synced up to the network. But as they are reading through the history, they can forget the old spent transactions to save space.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:07:11
Cool. It's great to see adoption.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:58:19
Sucks for me! My channel got closed against my will. Had to go through the process again, pay fees and wait for confirmations again. Thank God BTC fees weren't $50 like last December (that was a painful time).
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:43:04
I don't get it. My experience with LN points to far more centralization than a larger block size. Even in it's infancy LN is already beginning to centralize. I had my payment channel closed this morning against my will. It cost me real money and blocked access to my funds for several hours while setting up a new channel. I decided to pick one of the less popular nodes to help decentralization. But, now I'm worried this less popular node will shutdown like the first. I'm skeptical about the underlying architecture of the LN. Better go back to the drawing board if the goal is decentralization.
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:50:20
I see that you paid BTC and a low fee. Did they make you stick around for 3 confirmations? :)
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:29:48
Okay, i can kinda imagine that working if the exchange were on board with it -- interesting use case if it were to get implemented that way.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:58:02
Thank you for so adeptly pointing out the spelling error. No other comments as you seem to already know everything and I apparently have "no clue".
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:01:50
Agreed! My god! It seems that unless you just blindly believe that LN will cure all scaling issues than you are automatically suspect to ill intent and are evil. People wake up! Don't just drink the Kool aid! Look at the test results constructively. If I had 40 BTC I'd be scared as hell to put it out there on this new development project. Andreas at shitcoin dot com deserves praise for his work.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:16:20
Yeah, sure just dismiss my real world experience and lecture me with theory. What about when JPMorgan sets up a Lightning node to deposit you're BTC? It's absolutely mind boggling to me that some think Lightning node "centralization" is okay.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:53:43
I guess I don't see the problem with an anonymous decetralized public ledger, aka Bitcoin. If you need privacy, there are even on-chain solutions for that. It's naive to think LN somehow provides privacy.
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:04:43
What? No way this is possible! Please explain the technical how LN would protect your funds from an exchange hack.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:29:10
Cool, I've made a killing in alt coins. Buy low, sell high.
@_date: 2018-07-29 04:29:13
Sorry  I had misunderstood  comment. He wasn't talking about privacy, he was talking space requirements. Please enlighten me on how LN tx work to provide privacy. Are you using LN? Which LN wallet are you using?
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:43:14
Gold, shiny. Bitcoin, not shiny.
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:16:32
Woke up this morning to find that my LN payment channel has been closed (against my will). Now I have to go through the whole process again. Gotta pay more fees and wait for confirmations. Can I say, Lightning Network sucks for me right now!?!?
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:43:40
What's your reasoning for selling? How was Bitcoin Cash giving you so much burden? We'd like to know more of your story.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:31:42
Sorry, I guess I did misunderstand. So you're just thinking about storage space? Or, please explain about the coffee purchase example.
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:46:01
For UTXO to work, you don't have to keep everything forever. To save space, you can simply prune old spent transactions. It's important to keep unspent transactions, but spent transactions become irrelevant and can be pruned. So, if the coffee shop holds onto and never spends what you paid them, then your purchase would need to be visible. But, once they spend what you sent them, then there's no reason to hold onto it because it's a spent transaction two levels deep.
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:55:36
Huge shout out THANK YOU! to the guy who bought those Pizzas. Without it being used as money, Bitcoin is worthless.
