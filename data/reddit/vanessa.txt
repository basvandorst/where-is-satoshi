Thank you for your time. I am probably too deeply interested in how everything works, but its simply too comlicated.
Currently I am thinking: If I want to transfer funds, I need my private key. BUT I also need a program or something, which actually makes the request and transfers the funds, this program will need my private key. How do I know that this program does not copy my private key or saves it. 
All in all, somewhere I need to trust somebody to make a transaction.
My fear of using an unknown service is what stops me from using trevor etc. I'd like to have my key on my PC in an encrypted file. I encrypt everything with veracrypt anyway and I use keepass. I'd say I am very cautious.

Thanks for the reply. So If I create an address, f.e. with  [bitaddress.org]( then its a clean "address", which is not in the blockchain yet. But if it receives funds it will become part of the blockchain THIS is the time when the address is really created? 
And because the address is impossible to guess, it can not happen that it already exists in the blockchain and I send funds to someone else by mistake, who has already the same address, correct?

Thanks again! I dont want to code the keys myself. I was just trying to understand how someone could do this and add it to the blockchain.
Now I understand that creating a wallet offline, does not mean that it is part if the blockchain yet. The wallet is REALLY created after it makes a transaction and because of the randomness of the wallet address its impossible to "recreate" an existing wallet and send these funds by mistake to an already existing wallet.
Well actually in theory it is possible that someone has created an already existing wallet, but the chances are so low that it is impossible.
All in all, for paranoid people, it is probably smart to send a very small amount as the first transaction, to confirm that this wallet is now part of the blockchain and really exists.
Is all this correct?
Also the private key is not a password. It cannot be chosen. It always unlocks exactly 1 wallet. That is also the reason why someone could create a wallet offline or by himself with f.e. python.
