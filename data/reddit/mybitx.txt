Glad our video is getting some love =) 
This isn't a TV ad but part of the global launch for our Wallet apps. We'll be using this video as a first step in the mainstream user journey to promote interest in and understanding of Bitcoin. We'd love more feedback from the community on the ad, ideas for other videos in the future and what you all think of our apps.

Yip it's a hosted wallet. And thanks!

We like this idea of 'selling the dream' rather than focusing on a specific product or use case, it can be very powerful to many people. Your comments also make us realise there are many different potential users to consider and that we will have to cater for these in many different ways. Think our video budget just went up! Def some things to work with here, thanks!

BitX, biggest Bitcoin company in Africa here. We are operating in Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, and soon many other African countries. There are many truths and misconceptions about crypto + Africa. Feel free to ask us anything.

In the pipeline! Thanks!

Yes that is def a trend and the remittance thing will feature soon. Need to think about teen use cases in more detail and how we target that - do they use it because it is more practical in some sense, or because it is 'cool'? (and if so, why/how is it cool...)
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:27:09
Haha okay noted!
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:06:45
Okay thanks for this, noted.

Thanks that's a good idea - there are actually two good concepts here because it seems there is also a lot we can do around specifically demonstrating the hassles of a credit card vs Bitcoin. More specific ideas around this theme also welcome!

Cool! Although I think Xapo have hit this angle somewhat in their latest video, but we can try and make it more clear. All of this said these are potentially edge cases, ito of priority we would prob focus more on things that happen more often (like remittances for foreign workers) then to helping kids pay their bills in foreign countries... Keep 'em coming...

Yes, we are working on it. By the way, did you know BitX was the [first web wallet to implement payment protocol payments](
