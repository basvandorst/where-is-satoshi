If you read that post it's clear that the guy complaining about not hashing the passwords before transmission doesn't know what he is talking about.  
  
Passwords are usually submitted over SSL and then hashed server side as I'm sure MtGox was doing here. Sure, it's not very standard to submit a password via a get request rather than a post request, but it is not the major security concern that this image is making it out to be.  
  
The disadvantage of transmitting the username and password as query parameters rather than post data, is that the clear text password will be stored in the browser history and most probably in server logs too. However, the solution is not to hash the password before transmission, but rather to follow the standard practice of submitting the password via a post request over SSL.

In April reports surfaced that Facebook was seeking approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to start a service to allow users to send/store money on its platform.
Facebook recently hired PayPal President David Marcus to lead its Messaging Apps (a potential avenue to expand into payments).
David Marcus was an adamant supporter of Bitcoin prior to joining Facebook.
Remittances are a $500B low hanging fruit ripe for disruption.
Apple may have finally opened the doors for Bitcoin Apps within iOS.
A little over 2 months ago, Facebook (FB) made headlines for reportedly trying to obtain approval with the Central Bank of Ireland to send and store payments on its website.
The Guardian provided slightly more information in its publication on the matter:
Facebook is preparing a money transfer service in Europe that would allow it to compete with the likes of Western Union, while giving users the option of storing money with the social network or buying items online.
The US tech firm is seeking regulatory approval in its European base in Ireland for "e-money" status, which would see it issue digital credits that can be converted into cash by recipients.
The firm already has permission for some forms of money transfer in the US, which allow payments within apps, including the Candy Crush Saga and Farmville games, from which Facebook takes a 30% cut. The company facilitated $2.1bn (£1.3bn) in transactions across Facebook in 2013, primarily to games publishers.
Approval in Ireland would allow Facebook to operate an e-money service throughout Europe using "passporting", which allows digital payments to be used across EU member states without having to gain regulatory approval from each one.
This is potentially very big news for Facebook. As of now, the company makes nearly all of its revenue and profits from advertising. With 1B+ users spread all across the globe, Facebook has a unique opportunity to be a very disruptive force in the payment industry.
Things got even more interesting when Facebook followed up these payment rumors by poaching a digital payment visionary.
 David Marcus
On June 9th, Facebook hired David Marcus, the President of PayPal (EBAY) to lead its efforts in mobile messaging.
Marcus joined PayPal in 2011 as VP of mobile, to help lead its mobile payment efforts.
If Facebook is going to introduce a payment service, it's likely it could be tied to its messaging apps. Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) did something similar last year, when it allowed Google Wallet users to attach and send money with Gmail.
Marcus has also gone on the record in support of the disruptive potential of Bitcoin. He also insinuated numerous times that PayPal was considering integrating the crypto-currency into its services under his watch.
For more info on Marcus/Bitcoin see the links below:
"Why Paypal is Bullish on Bitcoin" - Fortune (May 2013)
"PayPal president David Marcus: Bitcoin is good, NFC is bad" - Cnet (December 2013)
"Paypal President hints at Bitcoin policy change" - Upstart (January 2013)
"Paypal President David Marcus - 'I Really Like Bitcoin'" -CoinReport (February 2014)
David Marcus makes Facebook's payment entrance far more realistic in my opinion. His experience in both mobile and payments seems like an ideal fit for not only Facebook, but any disruptive payment product taking advantage of the platform shift to mobile.
His open support of Bitcoin is yet another intriguing fact, given how much traction the crypto-currency is receiving in digital payments right now.
 Remittance/Payment Startups Gaining Steam
Online remittance startups like BitPesa that specialize in Bitcoin, have recently come into the spotlight.
As most Bitcoin followers know, remittances are a low hanging fruit for disruption, thanks to the proliferation of mobile devices. Money transfer services like Western Union (WU) charge obnoxious 10%+ fees to send money overseas. This technology and fee structure is wildly outdated to say the least.
For example, BitPesa (which only works in Kenya for now) charges 3% for a service that accomplishes the same goal. It does this by utilizing Bitcoin to get the money into Kenya, then converting it into the local currency.
Coindesk reports that global remittances total $500B annually, and the average fee for a given transaction is 9%. It's not hard to see how wildly popular and accretive a remittance service launched by Facebook would be, if it were to dramatically undercut the incumbent's fees (as BitPesa is doing).
 Finally Letting In Bitcoin Apps
The timing may finally be right for a major tech company to proliferate the mobile use of Bitcoin, thanks to Apple (AAPL). Apple had notoriously banned all Bitcoin transfer apps from The App Store, until several months ago.
Recently (as of WWDC), Apple has made a policy change, which has allowed Bitcoin transfer apps back on the market.
This opens the doors for a company like Facebook to begin integrating Bitcoin features into its suite of iOS apps. Apple's ban on Bitcoin apps had been stifling the crypto-currency's mobile adoption, and isolating hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users. Now that all has changed.
A service that will allow Facebook users to send and store money is a game-changer with or without Bitcoin integration.
The hiring of David Marcus gives us yet another clue that Facebook is strongly considering launching a payment service of its own. With a user-base over 1B and climbing, this represents a significant monetization opportunity for the rapidly growing social network.
If Bitcoin is integrated into Facebook's payment service, not only will the crypto-currency benefit greatly, but Facebook has the potential to disrupt a large chunk of the digital payment industry in one fell swoop.

Bitcore (not Bitcoin Core) is an open source node.js application developed by bitpay that provides tools that allow web developers to do things like monitor addresses on on the blockchain without interacting directly with Bitcoin Core (formerly Bitcoind) or using a proprietory API.
This article claims that bitcore has recently passed a series of tests which indicate that it correctly processes Bitcoin transactions.

If Bitcoins don't have value, then the transaction validating mechanism becomes a lot less useful. If Bitcoin has a market cap of $1, how would you use the network to transfer $10 to someone another country? The Bitcoin network allows you to transfer value without needing to resort to simply sending tokens backed by centralised issuers.

Even if you don't reuse addresses, there is still often enough information to link transactions back to you by analyzing change addresses.

ANOTHER Satoshi has bitten the dust. On May 2nd Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, published on his blog what he claimed was proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. Within 90 minutes the post had been debunked on Reddit, an online forum. He then said that he would present “extraordinary proof” that he is indeed Mr Nakamoto by moving some bitcoin from accounts thought to be under control of the currency’s creator. But on May 5th he wrote on his blog that he did not have the strength to continue trying to prove his identity, prompting most to add his name to the long list of false leads in the hunt for Mr Nakamoto.
In October 2008 somebody who went by that name posted an academic “white paper” online, outlining the design of a cryptocurrency the author dubbed bitcoin. The following January the same person switched on a system like the one outlined in the paper. But nobody, not even his closest collaborators, ever met Mr Nakamoto in person. They communicated with him only electronically. And a couple of years into the project, he stopped joining in. “I have moved on to other things,” he wrote in April 2011. Except for a few messages, most of which are believed to be hoaxes, he has not been heard from since.

Wright’s wrongs

The invention that underlies the currency, called the “blockchain”, is widely considered brilliant. That Mr Nakamoto has not basked in its glory suggests an overwhelming desire for privacy. Nor does Mr Nakamoto seem to be motivated by fortune: all bitcoin in circulation are now worth about $7 billion. Mr Nakamoto is thought to hold more than 1m bitcoin, worth about $450m at current rates (the currency’s value has recovered a bit after a steep fall—see chart).
Mr Nakamoto’s reclusiveness has given rise to a cottage industry of Satoshi-hunters. In 2014 Newsweek, an American magazine, identified a man called Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the real Satoshi, but he turned out not to be. In December 2015 it was Mr Wright’s turn to be outed: hackers leaked some of his e-mails and documents. But holes soon started to appear in that story, too. SGI, a maker of supercomputers, for instance, denied that it had ever done business with one of his firms, Cloudcroft. After a raid by Australian tax officials on his house in Sydney, many came to believe that the entire story was an elaborate hoax, perhaps one staged by Mr Wright himself.
Soon afterwards Mr Wright moved to London, where one of his companies has an office, but kept silent—until late March, when his public-relations agency contacted three media outlets, including The Economist, saying that Mr Wright wanted to refute claims that he had made the story up and to offer cryptographic proof that he is indeed Mr Nakamoto. Although he gave us a demonstration that seemed to show that he is in possession of cryptographic keys which only Mr Nakamoto should have, important questions remained. In particular, Mr Wright was unwilling to use his keys to sign digitally a message provided by us, which would have been stronger, although not absolutely watertight, evidence that he is Mr Nakamoto.
Others were convinced by his claim, however. Gavin Andresen, Mr Nakamoto’s successor as the leading developer of bitcoin’s software, confirmed in an interview that he had met Mr Wright and thought his proof was valid—an endorsement that lent credence to his claim.
Blog jam
This week Mr Wright published a blog post which he had promised would not only describe the proof in detail, but also provide data to allow it to be independently verified. But the post turned out to be an exercise in obfuscation: he laid out a very complicated way of proving his identity and provided as cryptographic proof a string of numbers that is publicly available.
This bungled self-outing provoked head-shaking among bitcoin gurus: if Mr Wright was indeed Mr Nakamoto, surely he could provide more convincing evidence? Mr Andresen, too, was flabbergasted by the blog post and later said that it was a mistake to endorse Mr Wright’s claim before reading it.
Faced with much ridicule, Mr Wright backed out. “I believed that I could do this,” he wrote in a new post. “I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke.”
The most obvious explanation for Mr Wright’s erratic behaviour is that he is indeed an imposter—and does not have the access to Mr Nakamoto’s keys. But things may be more complicated. One theory holds that Mr Wright was only one of a group of inventors of bitcoin. Ian Grigg, another bitcoin expert, recently wrote: “It is true that Craig is the larger part of the genius behind the team, but he could not have done it alone.” Two possible members of that team, Hal Finney and Dave Kleiman, have died.
In other words, the Satoshi saga will go on. In the meantime the bitcoin community remains divided community into two competing camps with different views about how the currency should evolve. One side wants to keep it smallish and pure; the other is pushing for it to grow rapidly, even if this means turning it into something more like a conventional payment system. The controversy has dragged on for months because bitcoin lacks institutions to reach and impose a decision.
The “civil war”, as some call it, has already slowed bitcoin down, says Jeff Garzik, another influential developer and co-founder of Bloq, a bitcoin startup. If the strife continues, another cryptocurrency may well supersede bitcoin—in which case the effort to establish Satoshi’s true identity will become academic.

I think we're still technically in a rise and the log scale is useful in either case to maintain long term perspective.

Perhaps a comparison to gold would make it clearer: One bitcoin is like a bar of gold, but there is nothing stopping you from trading in troy ounces or grams. With Bitcoin, however there is an even greater level of divisibility and 21 million would be more than enough to run an economy.

We're away on holiday in a foreign country and only had access to the most basic drawing and editing tools, yet my brother managed to create an awesome Bitcoin wizard.
Here is our submission:

How much does it cost?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:09:46
You're right, it all depends on the time scale. Perhaps more specifically the last week can be seen as a significant rise rather than a drop.

I'd also be interested to know where the money from the LoCG address went.

Change the vertical scale to logarithmic. This option is available under options on bitcoincharts.com and under settings on bitcoinwisdom.com.

It must be because he forgot to put the word glasses in his title.

The vertical scale is logarithmic and therefore each division represents a doubling in the value of Bitcoin relative to the previous division. This makes it easier to visualise the exponential rate at which the value of Bitcoin is increasing. The advantage of this scale is that a change in value from 0.5 to 1 USD can be seen to be just as significant as a change from 200 to 400 USD.

If you believe Bitcoin will ultimately be successful, now is a very good time to buy. However, if Bitcoin is ultimately destined to fail then nobody knows whether today is a good time to buy in terms of short term gains and it is therefore a very high risk investment.

I think most people have difficulty grasping exponential growth. No matter how educated we feel we are, a $200 increase in a few days feels much more unprecedented than this chart makes it look.

Bitcoin is currently used by far less than 1% of the world's population. How can it gain mainstream adoption without this kind of increase in value? For example, if 2 billion people were to use bitcoins at a point where there are 15million bitcoins in existence, the average person would own 7.5mBTC. Obviously all the assumptions in this example are not valid, but the point I'm trying to make is that for Bitcoin to become viable for mainstream use there will need to be further massive increases in value.

This is an awesome idea! Well done.

There are two meetup events planned in Cape Town this month, as discussed on [this]( thread.

I'm not a Bitcoin miner, but isn't the $65k per Terahash advertised by "Alydian" extremely expensive considering today's network hash rate of 3,303,639.82 GH/s?
