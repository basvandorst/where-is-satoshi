We'll see. They wouldn't tell us it was because of new restrictions just yet. At least not until Monday.

What you can do is a list of the following:
1. Contact them. Tell them you want cryptocurrency support. Email them saying you want it and ask why they won't allow the apps.
2. Post in the help forums asking why they will not allow it, and demand that they allow cryptocurrency wallets.
3. Call their stores and ask them why they won't allow it. Ask store managers to please forward a request to their corporate headquarters to allow it, because a mass influx of these collective requests from the ground (stores) would definitely make them reconsider.
4. Distribute a copy of a cryptocurrency app such as bitcoin to all devs who have a developer account with Apple, and have them all collectively submit it at the same time, to flood their system with it and to show that these wallets are in demand.

Sure, go ahead.

The reasons are mentioned in the linked article. It's fast, it provides a unique mixed transaction anonymity service, and its difficulty adjusts every 90 blocks to ensure a steady inflow of coin supply.

New account? I've been on reddit for over a year. Prove that it's a scam coin. It's not premined, it offers anonymity with the new mixed transaction feature, it has a 40 second transaction time, and its 90 block difficulty readjustment ensures there will be no hardforks and there will be a steady supply of stablecoins.
Bitcoin is nothing but a proof of concept. I know very well what I am doing, so it is you who I am hoping for.

What I'm asking is: Is StableCoin one of the most viable coins available right now, with all of its features and potentials taken into consideration against the other coins?
And do you think that Bitcoin and Litecoin mainly only have name recognition going for it right now as well? I have to agree that I view those coins as proof-of-concept coins, the Wright Brother's plane to the WW1 bombers.

I'll be honest, as great as bitcoin is, it's nothing but a proof of concept.
A different coin, with better settings and more advanced features, is likely to take hold, especially as bitcoin faces more and more attempted regulation.
I'm looking to stablecoin right now, considering bitcoin's volatility makes it not viable as a stable currency for businesses and people alike.

Thank you for the thoughtful comment, I see a lot hatred towards this post already with no thoughts added.
Although its not really worth mentioning, the SBC hashrate has hit about 3 GH/s at times, sextupling in the past 24 hours. Since Scrypt is like 1000 times slower, it's sort of equivalent to 3 TH/s.
Anyway, because the previous statement might not be entirely accurate, I wanted to ask you, would it even be possible to implement all of the aforementioned features, such as a 40 second transaction time? From what I understand, Bitcoin needs 10 minutes.

You did not refute my point. Call on other redditors to complain to the company itself or else this is just useless bickering, and Apple will never understand why this move is happening.
Don't tell me convincing apple to support Bitcoin wouldn't be a major win, because it would be.

Have you ever written anything to anyone?

You guys realize that Apple will not change their policy by making le upworthy smug comments about switching, right? You actually need to TELL the company why you are switching. Email them, contact them, tell representatives in stores about it, etc...

I agree, I imagine this is what happens when a business owner interested in bitcoin comes and sees this page:
Business owner: *scrolling through bitcoin google results* Oh, what's this page, r/bitcoin?
Hmm, this seems like an interesting place to discuss this currency
MtGox: The value of bitcoin has just decreased 500 dollars.
Business owner: Wow, I better go and check what this large bitcoin community has to say about this
r/bitcoin: LEL hey guise look at this le funny picture i made of le bitcoin man running up the falling graph! to da mooon! hahaha!
Business owner: Okay these people who own bitcoin are laughing about thousands of people losing their livelihoods, I better not use this currency ever.
