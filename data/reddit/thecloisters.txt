Don't listen to luke-jr, I was wondering how long it would take him to arrive and make this comment.
It is fine, he has some personal vendetta against paper wallets (we're all too dumb to use them) but there is no good technical reason no tot do it if you do it right

The ways I am imagining I gained from reading the whitepaper and the writing of Satoshi, so you are telling me that in fact the dream of Bitcoin is dead.
Well that's disappointing, I really liked the idea of a monye no one could take away from you

I was here because I read a great paper on decentralized internet cash, not a decentralized wiring system. Is the dream of Bitcoin dead? Should I just give up and move on with my life?

Hmm... 
One of us is having some misunderstandings here.
When you say the max block size was raised you mean when some miners raised their soft limits on the MAXBLOCKSIZE?  I think at best it's a bit disingenuous to declare that as claims a max block size was raised. 
I looked through your citation and I don't see evidence for what you are claiming it backs up. I see the size growing with some variation but the overall trend is clear.
As to your comment which is a reply to another comment, that comment is likely looking for data the supports your opinion and without an analysis I don't think this qualifies.


 do you have a source for why a large volume of tx that have fees like we do today would be unable to sustain the miners? 
Do you have extrapolated data and hard numbers showing
