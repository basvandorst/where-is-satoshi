When you send an email, under circumstance it will travel unencrypted through the internet. In practice, this means not only the government but a range of governments, ISP providers and potentially compromised hosts will be able to access your information.
This is why reasonable companies which deal with sensitive information (such as banks, for example) do not send summaries or receipts over email, but rather send you a link which you can then click to see them.

Yeah, plenty of analysis has been done. I can't seem to find it though. The main issue seems to be storage space, though, although bandwidth could also be an issue.

I bought at 16 on the way down. same experience, down on an almost 100% loss for a year or more.
I do want to have BTC because I believe in it as a technology, rather than looking for monetary gain. Monetary gain is always an awesome plus, though.

Bigger blocks could cause a centralized authority to be able to accept/reject blocks based on their own will. This will happen if running a node becomes prohibitive.

My argument is that I think it's plausible that political pressure might be imposed on bitcoin developers in order to make them implement changes that would impose censorship or other measures which are against the best interest of the ecosystem in general.
Of particular concern to me are measures that would revert payments in the event of major catastrophes (e.g. Mt. Gox), and measures that would link wallets to real life personas.
By having a hard stance against voluntary hard forks, we could prevent these issues and also not put developers in the position of being coerced into implementing these kinds of things.
I could be wrong, however, and I am certainly not an expert on this topic or any other. It's also pretty likely that what I am saying is nonsense.

The thing is though, a hard fork could change anything. People invest in bitcoin, for example, because the limit is a hard 21 million  and enforced "by math". A hard fork could change that and make it so the limit is 40 million.

Money is often a requirement to conduct operations, people need to print pamphlets, eat, etc. Being able to support these kinds of movements anonymously would I think be a great aid. If you think about it, even social networks played a role in the fall of e.g. Mubarak in egypt.
Of course, as you say, there are other risks and things that cannot be done anonymously and are of greater concern.

CC stands for credit cards. It is common for credit card thieves to buy things using stolen credit cards and then sell them using BTC so as to get money they can spend.

@_date: 2015-03-24 19:31:39
While I agree that you need to pay taxes and stuff, there is a limit to everything.
Citing an extreme, hyperbolic argument, would you allow your tax authority to put a camera in your house so they can see if you have any extra cash that you haven't reported?
Something less extreme, would it be appropriate for the TA to get access to your facebook account and see where you are spending your money and how much you are failing to declare?
There is a line, somewhere.
The argument most - reasonable - people in this thread make is that you cannot ask for the transactions of ALL people in an exchange. If you suspect Jake is doing something wrong, you can request his records, and that's fine, but requesting and inspecting the records for all people for no reason is unreasonable.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:52:53

@_date: 2015-03-24 22:23:55
No. U.S. has a history of prosecuting such services outside their jurisdiction:

I don't know why you say fail. While storing large amounts of money on wallet services is always a risk, you could use something like blockchain so that you can access your shiznits from anywhere you can run tails on.

@_date: 2015-02-09 19:26:14
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:17:32


Yeah, that's fine. If they were auditing the exchange it would be fine to obtain some data for all users, the usage of that data should be restricted to the auditing of the Exchange and not be extended to examination of each particular individual.
I disagree that by disclosing data to a third party you do not have any expectation of privacy, however. 
I also do not think discussing this topic further is productive as we have clearly different views regarding personal privacy and a cultural right to privacy, and that's fine.

Honest feedback: I looked at your website when you originally announced you were accepting bitcoin on this same subreddit, but I wasn't sure you were accepting bitcoin because it doesn't say so on the website.
I know it seems dumb :P
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:36:30
Increasing the block size would have other impacts, such as increasing the disk size required for network nodes. It could also result in an even more centralized bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:04:15
This is an interesting metric :P
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:11:27
In the IT industry, giving decision power to people with no understanding of technology leads to shitty software and shitty workplaces. Listening to your advice would probably make all -- volunteer -- developers quit.
Luke Jr. is a member of the community who has gone off rails, but I think we all agree giving decision power to "sales, marketing, and product development teams"  (whatever that means :S) is a terrible idea.
