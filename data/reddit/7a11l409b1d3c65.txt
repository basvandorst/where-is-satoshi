Mike isn't working at Bitcoin anymore. He can do whatever he wants after leaving. Also, XT tried to allow Bitcoin to scale, which is not in line with R3. It's not the goal of R3 to see Bitcoin grow.
Adam and the other core-devs on the other hand are actively involved in development while they are connected to Blockstream *at the same time*. There is clearly a conflict of interest.

As a general rule, *never* use 3rd party trading software, especially not with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:30:49
Yes, unless you write it yourself, it's 3rd party. But since the exchanges all provide easy-to-implement APIs, it's [not hard]( to write your own bot when using a language like Python.
The bot you linked suffers the same problem of centralization. If I had a winning strategy collecting 2% a week, how would I know that you are not frontrunning my strategy (which would make 5% without your frontruns)? There is no possible way for me to prove that.

People are obviously transacting less because the network was congested.

Do you realize that Coinsetter (which you aquired) pulled an exit-scam at the end of November, suddenly charging $65 monthly fee with less than 1 week notification? What are you going to do for customers affected by that? Any refunds?
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:32:00
Okay, thanks for clarification. I quit my account back then because of this.

So Core will become an altcoin by definition. Good luck with GregCoin.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:04:49
There are three people that have commit access to Core and are actively involved in development.
* Wladimir van der Laan
* Greg Maxwell (Blockstream)
* Pieter Wiulle (Blockstream)
I think Jeff and Gavin have commit access too, but they are not actively involved in Core anymore. So apart from these three people, nobody can change the code.

And you never will if you continue to use this subreddit as an information source. Those threads get censored instantly.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:45:10
Good luck.
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:54:01
Maybe. I really like Kraken and I liked the Coinsetter API.
However, *even the attempt* of an $65 fee is just too dodgy. Economically, there is no other intention to announce an $65 fee than to rip off funds from customers that forget checking their mails. Also, there never was any clarification or apology whatsoever. Everybody thought they are pulling an exit scam. In the Bitcoin environment, trust is extremely important, and Coinsetters image has suffered a lot by this shady move. Maybe you can check with the Coinsetter guys and make them issue a *complete* statement/clarification what was going on and why on earth they announced such a fee.

Thanks for clarification. You have a link to an up-to-date list?

No need to talk to me like that. And orderwalls having an impact on the price is [a fact](
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:15:56
Depends on how you buy it. If you would buy them with one market order, then the answer is: not many. But no whale does that because it means you have a lot of slippage.
Most whales build big positions with hidden/iceberg-orders, i.e. orders that do not show up in the orderbook (so people don't notice them building positions). For example, one strategy is pushing the market into your hidden orders by placing big scary walls on the other side of the orderbook, giving a false impression of a specific direction. Once you built a large enough position, you can remove your scare-order and scoop up the rest of the orderbook with a large taker.

This is because almost all of the criticism gets deleted and censored. Obviously the other sub appears "hostile" to you, as it holds the concerns and opinions of early-adopters and believers in Satoshi's idea, people who mostly got banned here.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:46:03


Why shouldn't it? What are your evaluation parameters for this statement?
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:30:45
Was there a DoS attack on Core nodes today? Nope, there wasn't. So...
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:53:28
He said it's bad that **the system** is controlled by just a handful of people, not Bitcoin-core. Mike actually criticised Core for deciding "via consensus" because this meant that no changes come through and the whole dev-progress is stalled. Mike always proposed a leader for Core and tried to persuade Gavin to step up and make final decision. But Gavin didn't want to. Every major open source project works like that by the way.

It's hard to forecast, but think that during the event of a fork, price will indeed take a hit. However, I would see it as a good opportunity to go long, since (for me) a fork to Classic guarantees long-term scaling and improves the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:46:45
Maybe someone who is familiar with scamming-techniques can comment on this? Paging @_date: 2016-02-01 19:13:55
At least there are *incentives* to scale. With Blockstream, there are no incentives to make the main protocol scale, since it would harm their own business model.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:43:52
But Adam is not the inventor of PoW. Hashcash is just *one implementation* of that, like Duracell is one implementation of a battery.
There are papers [dating back to 1992]( doing the same exact thing.
