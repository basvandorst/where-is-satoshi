Trading is for losers?
You gotta know that's a retarded statement, right?

I commented too. I'm sure we'll all get our BC and he wouldn't ruin his reputation over it.

Last reply on the subject.


So could the dollar. It's not relevant to the income you earned when it wasn't $0.


Oh, okay. I didn't know it worked that way. I'm going to withdraw my cash out of the bank and bury it in my yard. I'll just refuse to give it to them. Looks like all my tax paying problems are over now.


The point I've been trying to make is that paying taxes is not exactly optional which is what you've been hinting at. You wanna evade taxes? Nobody cares... But don't start spreading misinformation about using Bitcoin as a tool to commit tax fraud, and even going as far as to say that's why it was created. That's really toxic and doesn't help anyone.

This is wrong. The method in which you stash your profits from capital gains doesn't excuse you from paying tax on your income.

Bitcoin actually wasn't created so people could evade paying taxes on income earned.
Just because 99.9% of people (Not sure where you got that statistic... but no.) are not paying taxes, doesn't make it legal. Trust me, I'm not a fan of cutting Uncle Sam a slice of my income either, but to say you haven't realized any gains from the trading of bitcoin is false. Did you read the article that you linked? It doesn't matter if it's not paper money being earned... Because bitcoin has value.
Think about it. Say you bought 1k bitcoin at $10 in 2012. If you now buy $6MM worth of material possessions this year, all with your bitcoin, do you think the IRS is going to give a shit that you never paid USD for any of it come audit time? You'd be facing time for not reporting $5,990,000 dollars of income earned. Some countries are different, but I wouldn't try evading huge amounts of money in the US by clinging to the fact that the value was never denominated in USD.
