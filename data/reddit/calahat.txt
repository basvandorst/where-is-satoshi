**don't take my word for it**
When people hold USD or EUR, central banks inflate the currency, to motivate you to spend the money. 
Money doesn't have value on its own, but when it's moving.
BTC can't inflate. So people hodl it in hopes it will have more purchase power in the future. Like gold. That's why the gold standard was halted. 
Money must be spent. To make the world go round.
Thankfully BTC and Crypto in general is a bit difficult and scary to be used by the general public.

Sounds like a commercial, lol
 New money must buy BTC for it to rise and other ppl to cash out.

The problem with BTC is that it's volatile &amp; most ppl use it to make a profit, not as a currency.

Could you please use archive.org?

It certainly lost some value, but I think a lot of people (goverments, citizens, investors) still trust USDollar anyway. 
As for banks entering the game... they will certainly adopt blockchain at some point.
**Edit** I'm a noob, in terms of economics/business.
