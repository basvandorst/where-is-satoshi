Since the bitcoin bubble and participation by large swaths of new people were/are driven by advertising, part of me is sad. But most of me is really happy to see this. We don't want people in general to associate cryptocurrency with scams and pink-sheet type pump-and-dump behavior (any more than they already do).

Put volume and futures expiry on here and you may have a case.

Think of a hot wallet like cash. The amount of cash that any one person feels comfortable carrying varies. Keeping your funds in a hot wallet is like keeping your cash in an unproven, poorly insured bank with little-to-no reputation. In my case, I only keep as much as necessary for me to conduct forseeable transactions. Anything more is a completely unjustifiable risk.

This increases my confidence that my worst nightmare will come true. The biggest governments in the world may outlaw use of cryptocurrencies as actual currency except for their own state-run cryptocurrency.  It'll destroy most of the utility of most cryptocurrencies. 
Fingers crossed that governments will make their own coins without attempting to squash stateless coins!

The squiggly lines around the wooden pillars at the top let me know that the BTC is in a slingshot about to break out, as opposed to lounging in a pit in a hammock that's about to break at its anchors.

You mean what if it decreases in exchange value until there are no more buyers?

The Fed is a Fraud, Tether is Too. Buy you some bitcoin, and go to the moon!

true dat, but look how well they did during those bubbles!

I assume by that point there'll be privately-managed, government-backed, centralized cryptocurrencies that'll be tied into large networks working completely intuitively in our daily lives - more inutitively than cash works now.  For the ability to reverse charges, generate useful currency ad hoc, and for ease of use, people will gladly accept their government's currency.  The governments will retain control, artificially enforce notions of stability, and large privates institutions will continue the global financial rape of the financially illiterate and barely-banked.
But wow it's going to be really easy to buy your coffee with crypto!

I can't really tell if you're accusing me of making spurious correlations in my comment.  Please notice where I said "If" and "then." The analysis could be done properly to demonstrate a high degree of correlation, which as you point out does not prove causality, however correlation is not always meaningless. And in this case, depending on what other evidence there is (or is not), the correlation may be very, very informative.
To be clear, I am not selling that narrative. I'm just saying that the analysis presented doesn't really address the possibilities engendered by the hypothesis (narrative) that Tether may be manipulating the market.

I am assuming that eventually we'll have trade blocks like the EU built on a few cryptos that'll be fairly immune from that sort of abusive behavior. The opposite of your statement is true as well. Not all places are banana republics with selfish, corrupt officials at the helm, destroying anything they can in order to maximize their personal gain from their time in office.

This statement is not true for the US.  The federal government insures deposits up to $200,000.

Plenty, but no more than plenty.

The analysis presumes that any illicit actions taken by Tether would be highly systematic. They have not been systematically creating new tethers, nor has the price of bitcoin behaved systematically, and their analysis uses all time points, which really doesn't make sense given the hypothesis.  If Tether was only manipulating the markets following the generation of massive quantities of tether and used it to prop up the market over the course of days to weeks within that timeframe, then the statistician's use of all daily data points would drown out any signal with irrelevant noise.

If you're not an expert, then you should really practice having a 30 second, 2 minute, and 5 minute answer prepared for the basic questions that you'll find on literally ANY FAQ out there on bitcoin. 
What will the format be? Will it be Q/A or are you going to be allowed to discuss what you choose?  Will you be asked to give your perspective on more generalities like problems with modern day currencies in general?
The topic of inflationary vs deflationary currencies is kind of a big deal for people who get hard for bitcoin. You may want to be able to discuss why, when more of a currency is printed, it's bad for those who merely save their money. Then you can contrast that with bitcoin.

Sure, in general I agree with everything you said.  The author has only demonstrated that the mere generation of Tethers doesn't correlate with changes in bitcoin price on an intraday or on a fixed window timescale.  This suggests that there was not systematic, consistent, large-scale, highly transparent manipulation of the system by the issuance of Tethers.  Please keep in mind, however, that issuance of Tethers wouldn't itself be expected to alter the market. It's only use of those Tethers in the large-scale purchase of BTC that would be expected to influence the price. And the influence could manifest in EITHER a raise in the price, or sustaining a price where the price would have gone much lower. My issue is with the assumption the author has made that any manipulation was systematic and occurred in a fixed pattern.  While it's worth addressing this possibility, the author has not even come close to performing the relevant analyses to make a more generalized claim that there does not exist any correlation between Tether issuance and the price of bitcoin.

That's a great way to get your own phone number blocked by your bank or to be rerouted to an agent whose sole job it is to waste as much of your time as you'd like to waste. (edited for grammar/spelling)

This author was both factually incorrect and grammatically disappointing.
