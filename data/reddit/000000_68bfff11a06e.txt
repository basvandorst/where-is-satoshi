If full scale is the main thing you want, use a fintech company software. But if you understand that decentralization is one of the pillars of Bitcoin and its value in society, you have to be ready to concede and accept that it must be easy to run a full node. Plus... you will NEVER scale on chain in any meaningful way with our current and foreseeable understanding of computation. Forget it or keep waiting for some singularity idk. 
Edit: Nobody said "old laptop".

Quantum computers perform better for some kind of problems. If you are curious, they are pretty good with algorithms like Grover's Algorithm, Shor's Algorithm and some others. So, not a big problem for mining since it involves sha256 hashes for which quantum does not represent a big threat. 
It happens, though, that it can be pretty good at reversing (factoring) from the public key to private key so we'd have to change its algorithm to a quantum proof one (years before the threat being real and widespread, optimally). 
Now here's a a thing to think about... LOTS of early bitcoins were mined directly to public keys (and not addresses - which are hashes of the public keys) so we already know these public keys. There are really BIG prizes for anyone able to reverse the pubkeys and get the privkeys waiting to be claimed. The question is: what happens to the market when millions of coins move? And to Bitcoin's price? Could we freeze these bitcoins (I don't think this is moral or would be accepted by the network, though)? Anyone's got technical or economical research on what could be done?
I don't know what would happen to the market and the price, and if that would be a real problem... I'm just throwing it here since I'm very curious about this topic. 
Edit: I was thinking if it could possible to get consensus on having a timeframe to update keys before freezing them or applying another policy. Note that I'm not saying this is a good idea... I tend to think it would be a very bad idea actually.

So what? This is how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:29:33
People involved in crypto also wrote and tried a lot on decentralized digital money years before Bitcoin. That's how secure software and hard technology work.

lol Stop the nonsense. Why do you use words like lie, huge or convoluted? Oh, yeah, because they are part of the english vocabulary and help you express your point of view. My point of view is mine and I express it with the words I want... And you're free to disagree. 
So, tell me exactly where and how I'm lying, and then you can start forming some arguments. Because "you are proposing a convoluted solution to a simple problem" and "Changing a constant is simpler than any other proposal" are just emotional assertions.

Barry Silbert: not a developer. 
Erik Voorhees: not a developer. 
Stephen Pair: not a developer. 
Slush is okay(ish) to be counted. The other names are useless in this context.

Network propagation and validation is a tricky problem. It's not about storage only.
Blocks 10x larger right now would be suicide, 5x larger would be very dangerous, 2x larger (and a bit more) is part of what segwit already brings. 
Segwit -&gt; Lightning is the way to go for now. It also comes with some tx capacity increase danger but much more manageable and mitigated by new possibilities.
Please, emphasis on "for now".

I don't think UASF is a good first option but it may really be our option to show we are vigilant and will do what is needed to keep controlling our own money.
See you all on the other side. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:02:36
Good time to UASF.
Let's see how that "hash power is law" plays out when their blocks are orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:57:13
That's how bitcoin works. Nothing is broken. 
And segwit is ready to be activated; which means a short term capacity bump plus facilitation for smart scaling approaches in the medium term. But I suppose miners are not feeling the same way as you do about the mempool since segwit is not activated yet. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No need to hurry, then.
We will UASF the game when/if needed. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:16:59
If we will just get a handful of guys in a room to solve these issues, why would we use PoW? There's a reason nodes verify blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:18:08
Segwit + 2MB equals to ~8MB block size. That has to be accounted. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:41:25
UASF has its risks, you are right. At the moment, though, I think it's a reasonable option given the alternatives. But fuck what I think about this...
I just came here to tell you that same old cliche: don't have more bitcoins than you can afford losing. Some things have a very good reason for being "that same old cliche".
Even though I believe in Bitcoin's chance of success, it realistically may fail hard... or at least suffer a biiig price drop down the line. I expect some disruption in case of BIP148 UASF event but I'm all for it right now.

AFAIK Twitter is all about that 140-char sound bytes shit, and technical experts have already weighed in on more appropriate places with way lengthier rationales. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:23:41
Yeah. Developers are not in charge but good luck gathering an internet mob to design software. (
Besides... somebody will have to code this view since Core has no obligations and code will not rain from the sky just because some people have strong opinions. 
Agreements do not release software. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Completely different. Satoshi decided that before there were any stakeholders or market... And it's been the same coded inflation rate since then.
The inflation rate itself is almost meaningless if it doesn't change along the way.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:15:37
That's not how UASF will work. It will not rely on random nodes. Stop spreading bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:16:01
Not impossible but I expect it to be a lot more problematic and contentious to do the same with Bitcoin. And if this happened I would be out (or at least would stay on the fork without the bail out). 
As a side note... technically they did not undid the transactions and only altered the state which is more decoupled from history in Ethereum's account model.  I don't think that makes it any better but they like to point that as a great feature.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:42:22
Okay, I believe you. "You say tomayto, I say tomahto"... Happens all the time.  
The immutability that matters here and is one of Bitcoin's main value propositions means that nobody can arbitrarily and selectively change your UTXOs (or the bitcoins you have) after a certain depth. Code, PoW, etc... all may and WILL change to keep incentives aligned and Bitcoin network's health.
Nevertheless, PoW change is a nuclear option in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:19:09
lol you're changing goalposts with this "most general, logical sense" bullshit. 
The only thing we owe miners is the mining reward just after a valid PoW block... nothing more. Saying otherwise is useless appeal to emotions (in a Stockholm syndrome fashion) in the middle of a hostage situation.
