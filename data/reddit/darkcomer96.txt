Edit 2: wait, you mean you bought ONE WHOLE BITCOIN for $15??!?!?!!!

Can someone put this into beginner language please...I’m lost

Ok I’m kinda new here, what exactly does “hodl” and “fiat” mean? Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:54:24
When you say best rates, do you mean like a couple of bucks savings or what?
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:33:50
You should always hodl and keep investing. The possibility of BTC plummeting is kind of improbable
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:37:19
Sooo once all this blocks are completed, BTC price is expected to go up?

@_date: 2017-08-06 02:32:07
Ahhh now I see. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:14:17
When you say a few bitcoins, we take it as a WHOLE BTC... not just like 1% or whatever

I am still kinda new so stuck with me. Ok I’m seeing this “exchange” stuff and I want to know the difference between the exchange and something like Coinbase.
