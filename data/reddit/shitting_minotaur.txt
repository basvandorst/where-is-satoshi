I bought a ticket to Chile through cheapair.com paid with Bitcoin. I'm actually in the airport right now waiting for my flight.

Has anyone tried it? Does it work?

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the future!

This is a perfect example of the kind of tools that need to be developed in order for bitcoin to succeed.

I'm pretty sure that the people running these companies (BFL, Hashfast) know exactly what they're doing. The company might get hit with a lawsuit, but the people at the top have almost certainly made a shitload of money mining bitcoins with the hardware that customers paid for in advance. Even if the company was sued and forced into bankruptcy, the people in charge can still make off with fortunes in bitcoin.

Yeah but if everyone forgets in a week and people start going back to Ghash, then we are back to square one.

Why would anyone buy this at that price?

I see what you did there
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:34:53
That's all fine, but in my opinion the fact that Bitcoin is not regulated is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:27:31
I got one too
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:08:17
Coincoin. Can't wait to see that one.

While you do have a point, it's important to understand that banks make money off of the people they do business with. Moreover, they make WAY more money off of those people than they give back, whether it be in terms of interest paid, money reimbursed in the event of theft, or any other such "regulation". Banks might offer security, but you ultimately pay for it. 
Personally, I think Bitcoins lack of regulation is a positive thing. It forces people to learn about something and take responsibility for their own business, rather than perpetuate the pervasive laziness epidemic that is afflicting our society.

It's a new feature they're adding to Bitcoin in the next update
