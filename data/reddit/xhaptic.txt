Wow, I did not expect a feature like that in your first release. Seriously impressive stuff!

Yeah most likely. One small recommendation from a UX perspective. The grey icons make it somewhat difficult to quickly identify a coin I am trying to find. Although the grey icons in themselves look great, I think it would be easier for the user if the icons were the same colored icons we are used to seeing everywhere else. Once again, great work and just unwanted my 2 cents.

Interestingly I simply force closed the app and then restarted it and it worked. Before I restarted I did change the "Auto update holdings at launch" to Yes. 
So looks like there might be a small bug on the initial Binance request that a simple app restart fixes, might be worth a look. 
I work as a dev as well and this is really great work! Keep it up.

I am not, I created the keys specifically for your app. I am not sure I know what you mean by "syncing the system clock", a little more detail would be great. The Coinbase import worked just fine so it seems to be only related to Binance.

Binance API is not working for me. I have it set to read only, I am using the QR import. I double checked the key and secret match yet it fails on the sync. Any tips?

I have been using Bitsnapp as my main tracker for a few days now and it has been great! 
It would be really nice if you could add a tab that shows a little more info about all of the coins you own. Something similar to coinmarketcap or coin.fyi. I really like to be able to see how my coins are performing hourly, daily, weekly, monthly etc. It would be nice if there was a tab to show how only my coins are performing across those time periods in a datagrid of some type. You could also include market cap, supply and other relevant information.
Along those same lines it would be nice to change in the main list view the percentage per coin to something else than just 24h. 
Once again great work!
