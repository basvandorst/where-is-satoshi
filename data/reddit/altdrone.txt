Probably mining company saw the price pumped by speculators and decided to sell. 
Then the pump&amp;dumpers saw the fall got scared and started selling.
The drop will eventually attract new pump&amp;dumpers. But now we have more coins.
I think we will touch the 600 lvl before bouncing to the moon before halving.

Dump everything now! 
You will buy way cheaper once the whales leave.

I see 3 possible scenarios 
*A large miner sold their stock to take profit before the even higher volatility as we approach to halving
*Pump and dumpers taking profit and noobs getting scared 
*Whales dumping a % to buy cheaper
