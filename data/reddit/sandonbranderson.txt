You are confusing withholding with the actual tax bill. If you have $100 in income tax withheld every month but qualify for a $1200 tax credit when you do your return and receive a $1200 refund then you paid $0 in income taxes. 
Edit. Many Americans receive a refund equal to or greater than their withholding, hence they pay no income taxes. (This is stealth welfare)
When your taxes are done this year see compare how much you had withheld with your refund if you receive one. 
edit. The big tax bill was almost delayed because Sen. Rubio wanted to expand the refundable portion of the child tax credit. So even more Americans will now receive more in refund than they had withheld.

You lead a very sheltered life of you think that. Consider yourself fortunate.

Yea. I was saying you're a bum, not that you are a criminal. Sorry for the confusion.

You honestly think you would have that job, the means to get to it, and the means to secure your earnings if it we're not for the government? Really?
I've been places with no strong government. Be happy you don't have to deal with th consequences of your ideology.

Good luck with that. If you think you are safe to break the law and that they won't get their money you are very naive. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:42
That is an incredibly unsophisticated and naive opinion. Taxation is the reason you can safely post that opinion online.

$100 on the walk to my car, another $100 by the time I got home. Weird.
Edit. Another $100.
Edit. Guessing 14k by the time I'm done walking my dog.

You can use the losses to offer your gains.

Boo I'm a thief! 
He's a freeloader if he doesn't pay his taxes.

You only pay on the profits.

You live with your parents. Run along.
Edit. A grown "adult" who lives with her parents. And you think you can talk condescendingly about taxes? I'm sure I make much more than you, I'm fine with supporting the societal infrastructure that allows us all to function. You probably don't even end up paying income tax. You're not even paying payroll taxes.

Have fun being an actual prison bitch. ��

Why do you think I owe you politeness when my first interaction with you was you calling me a dog? (In a bad way)
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:52:20
Plenty of wage earners don't pay income tax. Refundable tax credits like EITC or the child tax credit. 
Edit. Or even nonrefundable tax credits can take a tax liability down to zero.

I never said it was criminal. In fact I'm explaining how the law allows it. Didn't mean to make it seem criminal. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:42:22
Sorry to have offended you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:20:22
I live in the country that pays for the defense of yours, I'd be appreciative of the fact that Americans are paying taxes if I were you. ��

I guess there's no shortage of greater fools yet. Good news for this fool who bought in at $9k.
This is going to be fun when it crashes.

Imagine being this stupid. ��

I mean their money. Really our money. It isn't his road that he uses to get to work. Or his Navy that keeps trade lines open so he can buy cheap foreign goods. Or his FDA that helps keep him reasonably assured his food won't kill him.

Down to $13400 on Gemini when I got back.
