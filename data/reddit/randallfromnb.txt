Thanks for answering.   One last question if you don't mind:  my friend has $100 in bitcoin (and $100 in ethereum) and asked if he can store them in my ledger nano.  Do they allow for two different bitcoin accounts?  Or would it have to be added to mine?  Or would he need his own ledger? 
Edit: I replied to the wrong comment.

I want ripple as well.  Seems to be hard to get a hold of.  I see it offered for btc but I'm not willing to part with any.  I just want to spend dollars.

You should update us every month to keep yourself accountable and stay in track.

Out of four verified exhange that on this is the only thing working for me.  I just don't like how I'm limited to $200 per week.  Gemini worked but I had to go to a store and buy some kind of prepaid card and then transfer the bitcoin.  I just hate how much they charge.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:46:26
Yes.  Buy back when she's worth less.

Oh.  The actor who played the Lone Ranger in the latest Disney movie also played both Winklevoss twins in the movie "The Social Network".  The Winklevoss twins currently own over one billion worth of bitcoins.

Mine is in the mail.  Is the setup complicated?  I currently only have about 400 worth of btc at coinbase.  Is there a cost to put it in a hard wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:19
I don't get it. Off to google "fomo'er"
Edit:  yep.  I've been trying to invest five figures for the last few weeks.  I've managed to get only a few hundred in.  Everywhere else is shut down or still in verification process.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:25
Don't do this.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:15:19
Me.  I bought my first stocks in august and made 30% so I started reading all of the investing subreddits.   About a month ago I found this subreddit and bought some bitcoin.  I now only have $400 worth bit this subreddit seems to be all I'm interested in now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:50:22
I'm wondering this same thing.   I hope this thread fills up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:21:45
I hope you go long on this one.  Hodl him close.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:23
I'm impressed you were able to buy any at all.  Every exchange I've tried today is down.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:33:00
I did.  They asked if I visit the (exchange) site often.  I told them a few times.  Then they randomly asked me if I'm using coinbase. (unrelated to what I was doing)  I said that I use it often.  They said that they didn't know why my credit cards weren't working and to try again tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:44
There's got to be a joke in here about them both being imaginary.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:00:52
I see this often.   What does investing in blockchain mean?   I know what blockcha in is but does that just mean you're investing in other crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:30:24
I thought so too.  So I bought a pizza for supper and the card worked.   Then I went back online and it didn't work again.  Five cards from three institutions.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:09:02
Because its Sunday night at midnight.  The issue was that my card wasn't verified by visa.  So I called Visa.   And visa couldn't verify their own cards.

I'm under the impression that they also weren't allowed to own anything like land.  So they had to lend money and earn interest so they could sustain themselves.

It's weird how the banks banned it yet the Bulgarian government owns 3.3 billion worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:00:35
My wallet is in the mail.  Once it gets here that's what I'm going to do.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:41
My son literally just did this.  He came to me telling me his bitcoin crashed.  His worth went from $101 to $100.  I informed him that it's not a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:26:43
No that was just the nice dip that allowed me to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:38
I'm new to this.  Is there a way that we can forget coinbase and just buy and sell from each other?  Is there a way to turn a subreddit into an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:34:12
They said the exhange was the problem and that there must be something wrong with their website.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:45:20
Guys.  Stop fighting.  This is between me and my son.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:12:42
Agreed.   Just some idiot trying to scam people.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:46:40
This is brave.  When did you buy in?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:17:50
Over the past two days I've had five credit cards blocked when trying to by at Coinmama.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:28:41
Bitcoin will be your new addiction.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:33:06
I submitted a post asking those who were purchasing bitcoin if they were also buying other crypto.  I wanted to know which ones and why.  I'm just trying to learn here yet someone apparently "silently" removed my post without even letting me know.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:50
This lady seems great.  I hope people don't try to take advantage of her generosity and try to flock to her looking for bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:45:06
Surprise her.  Propose to her now and tell her that Japan is the honeymoon.  Plan the wedding for 1+ years from now and keep watching your bitcoin grow.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:10:08
Is this a joke about the guy who played the Lone Ranger also playing the Winklevoss twins?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:37:13
I'd like some advice on where else to buy as well.  I'm CanadIan.

If you put 5% of your net worth into bitcoin one year ago it would now be 1% of your net worth.  Assuming your financial situation remained unchanged.
Edit: Geez guys..  I'm long on bitcoin.  It's a joke.
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:57:58
This is the right answer.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:27:19
I like how he describes money as a universal converter.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:36:54
If you keep buying bitcoin and it keeps dropping in value isn't that much like inflation?
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:37:40
Buy a prepaid visa card.  Use that to buy your crypto.
