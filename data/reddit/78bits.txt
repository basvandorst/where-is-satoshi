$1000 is still a psychological barrier for most people. 
When 1 bitcoin is more than $1000, most people think it is very good price = very expensive.
It is only when everyone think $1000 is not a big deal/cheap, then the price will continue to move to another "very good"/"expensive" point- $2000 perhaps?

[Based on a table published on 13-Sep-16]( there are 92,708 addresses with amount &gt; 21BTC, which accounted for 13,850,101 BTC.
On that day, the total number of bitcoin was 15,870,602 BTC.
So 15,870,602 - 13,850,101 = 2,020,501, which is about 96,214 x 21 BTC.
Therefore, based on this data, on 13-Sep-16, the MAXIMUM possible number of individuals with at least 21BTC (21 club?) was:
92,708 + 96214 = **188,922** individuals (max)

I think the last picture "The last bitcoin block, 2140" is wrong. Bitcoin will continue after the last block "with reward" in 2140. After which the "block" will continue to add on every 10 minutes with the miners rewarded with the fee... So unless the bitcoin dies in 2140, the blockchain will continue....

Many USB ASIC miners came out during that period of time.
I was using 4 x 2Ghash Redfury which gave me about 0.01BTC per day. However, the rate of production dropped very fast and halved in just after 2 to 3 difficulty adjustments.
So I guess if you are using a CPU (about 2-3MHash) to mine at that time, you should only receive 5 to 10 bits per day??

I am not expert, but basically you are sending the coins between your own addresses... 
1. Why are you sending coins between your own addresses? For fun/experiment? No problem with reply attacks.
2. You want to spend them, you have to send them to another person's address (which you don't hold the private key). In this case, both BTC and BTC2X will go to the other person's addresses, even if you are only sending BTC2x.

I can consider myself as a BTC supporter, but I am still keeping both coins. * I acquired them before 1st August.
I think the sum of the value of the 2 coins should be the final value of bitcoin as a whole. If one of them fail, the value will be transferred to the other.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:57:45
The reasons for this high price is understandable. My question is the volume. Did anyone actually buy at this price? How many coins was transacted?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:11:08

The average block time is usually less than 10 min for the past many years due to the ever increasing hashing power. In fact the estimated reward halving time, based on 10min/block is getting nearer and nearer.

If your computer is on 24/7 and your electricity is somewhat covered, then Nicehash can actually bring you some bits/mBTC. Otherwise it is just a waste of electricity cost and life-span of your computer.

1) Goto [Bitaddress]( to generate an address.
2) Keep the "Private key" in secret, don't lose it.
3) Post the "Public key" here.
4) Wait to see if anyone send you a hello tip. 
5) If any kind soul did that, wait for the transaction to be "confirmed".
6) Learn how to spend it!

You will regret in 3 months' time when the price dropped.... but don't sell! HODL!
AND then after 3 years... you will be glad you invested this much!!!

BIP38 is a method to encrypt your private keys with a passphrase. You need both the private key (which starts with 6) and the passphrase to work. It won't work with only the passphrase.
Besides, when the balance is transferred out of one of the addresses, the software is using the WIF private key derived from the BIP38 private key. So no information related to the BIP38 private key and passphrase will ever be derived from the transaction.

This is not going to work.... Traders love volatility and there are also whales that work on pump and dump scheme... Also at individual level, greed is making people to sell... At the moment, people still need fiat for their daily life and they need to cash out.

Easy! I am using "TP's Go Bitcoin Tests"
Let say if we want to create the following
Replaced "l" with 1, since "l" is invalid; xxxxxxxxx = 9 characters game_id; XXXXXX is the 6 characters checksum.
    Step 1: Go to the following site:
    
    Step 2: Put the address you want in "9 - Base58 encoding of 8"
    eg. 1MikesRea11yCoo1AppABCDE1234XXXXXX
    
    Click "send" beside the address. You should get a red "Invalid checksum". Doesn't matter.
    Step 3: Click the "send" under "3 - RIPEMD-160 Hash of 2"
    You should be able to get the right address with the right checksum. 
    eg. 1MikesRea11yCoo1AppABCDE1234VFB3nc
Please let me know if this works for you!

Update to the latest version of bitcoin core and allow it to complete the sync. The final balance should reflect the actual amount you have, which should be 0.00000002.
Everything is recorded in the blockchain, so if there is nothing left in your "receiving addresses", most likely you do not have anything left.

Coinbase fee at the moment is about 750bits. So your 192 bits fee is considered very low... no worry just have to wait a bit longer.

Just check the balance of all 9 receiving addresses in blockchain.info.
Creating new receiving addresses shouldn't help.

Also, many characters can be misleading.
For example, small c,k,s,p,u,y,z may be mistaken as Big C,K,S,P,U,Y,Z, vice-versa.
This is the problem with human handwriting. Try it. and good luck!

Coinbase was founded in 2012 and the first mobile bitcoin wallet only appear some time in 2013. 
Blockchain.info was found in Aug 2011 so this could be the one. Other than that, bitcoin-qt - he need to locate the wallet.dat file from his old computer- just hope the harddisk is still working.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:49:21
You only have two receiving addresses:
1BpieLNqX9V8V1ZejQVQGqx8oj7kxmRfMA = 0 BTC
19geuPezkNeacoupQXcNNh6WB2sKWhdzZK = 2 satoshi
So, there is nothing left in your wallet and most likely your bitcoin-QT is not sync to reflect this.
As for the 2 Satoshi from the 1Enjoy and 1 Sochi, they are just spams...

Yes. So it is better to get another 100 people to buy 2 ice creams together, so that the fee will still be $2.30 for $1000 transaction... This is why we need "off-chain" transactions...
By the way, if the ice cream man also uses Coinbase, the transaction between your Coinbase account and his Coinbase account is free...

Many people used to donate using Changetip, which was used to be a popular tool in reddit.
I think it is becoming less known especially after most of Changetip staff were hired by Airbnb.
