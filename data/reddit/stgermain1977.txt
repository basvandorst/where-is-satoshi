unfortunately, I dont have access to a Linux system. I tried to import the key on blockchain.info, but it says it is invalid.
But, I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong somewhere.

Thanks for the link and help! However, I'm a noob and I'm not sure what I'm looking at. This the a [link to my BTC transaction]( Are you able to give me additional context?
Thanks again for your patience :-)

Thanks for the advice! It looks like a readme file with some code-like instructions. However, most importantly, there appears to be a 256 character private key.
What should I do next?

I transferred ~0.03 bitcoins from an exchange to a different exchange about 3hrs ago. When should I expect it to arrive? Thanks for helping a newbie!

hey there. I seem to have the exact same issue with the exact same former wallet.
Thing is, I don't have a linux system and wouldn't even know where to get access to one.
What did you end up doing? Were you able to recover anything?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:49:22
yes, please elaborate
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:36:38
that sucks.

oh shoot... those 3 confirmations must just have happened (I was still at 0 when I sent the link). An no, not in my wallet yet, but atleast there's traction.
Btw, I can't thank you enough with all the hand-holding you've had to with me. Trust me... when I get to be confident about all this, I'll pass it forward to the next noob ;-)

Leaders not so much from an institutional perspective, but from an innovation one.
