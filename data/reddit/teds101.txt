Which was exactly my point. People are still investing into BTC thinking that they're going to become richer than oil field inheritors in the next decade. I think most of that ship has sailed. To even come close to the equivalent of BTC going from $0.004 to $1000, BTC would have to hit $250,000,000. Doge is dirt cheap to buy, and easy to mine. If it ever hits even a cent or two per Doge, then that's a great increase.

BTC for a dollar? Thanks for the laughs -2009
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:54:26
I'm mining for the very very small possibility of them ever hitting a dollar each at the least. If I wanted to I could just sell them for btc as I'm mining them, theyre putting out more profit if not the same as lite coin, which I stopped mining a few days ago. I think it's a gimmick, itll die with the meme this year but hey you never know. When it first started a few weeks ago people were giving hundreds of thousands away. Now 4-7,000 is like 3-4$.
Edit: I don't remember ever claiming that doge was going to hit $1 a coin. I said that I'm holding on the slim chance that it grows. Doge can still increase in value x100, bitcoin would have to be up to $750-$850k:1BTC in order for that to happen. Will Doge go up in value? Who knows. If it doesn't, I don't care. If it does, then I'll be wealthier than before I started mining Doge.

Somebody fact check this. Might consider investing.

Sorry to break it to you, but I just learned the truth myself as well. The cost of electricity it takes to run the machine is greatly more than your return. Right now I have a GTX480 making 118Mh/s. My computer is running about 350W right now just being on and having my GTX480 at full power (The card itself runs 250W). 350W running 24/7 for a month, when using the average electricity rate of 0.14$ kw/h is about 30-35$. Running at 118mh/s is churning out about 12$ worth of bitcoins a month for me. I honestly think home rigs aren't worth it anymore, at least at the current value, it's borderline profitable.The best choice would to be invest in dedicated bitcoin machines. 
I know butterfly labs has a machine that is 599$, runs 80W and puts out ~800Mh/s. 80W is about 8$ a month to run at 0.14KW/h, and 800mh/s gives you about 92$ worth of bitcoins per month. Giving you in theory about 84$ in profit per month. You'd have your money back for the machine you paid within 6 months! After that, you're making 84$ a month just by having that machine on. Now imagine if bitcoins hit 50$:1BTC again. You would be making more than 300$ a month just by having the machine running.
TL;DR Right now, home machines aren't worth it, even home machines made to bitcoin mine are barely profitable. If you believe in bitcoins, invest in a dedicated machine. 
Edit: Also BFL announced that they are releasing a 150$ machine called the jalapeno. They announced it would churn out 4.5GH/s (4500mh/s). Many people think it'll be more like 3.5Gh/s. I don't know how much wattage it uses, but it probably will not be more than the ground breaking 520$ worth of bitcoins its estimated to pull in a month. They say if it actually lives up to the estimates, near all mining equipment will be worthless. You have to remember, you're investing, but you're investing with hardware which depreciates faster than a luxury car. Ok maybe not that fast.

Her job was just to call you and let you know, not to debate. Just a messenger,  she probably doesn't even know what btc is. [Coming from someone who calls people about things I know nothing about]

Gallardos are the rich poor man's lambo. Volkswagen influenced and largely produced compared to other models. Hell I thought they were around 100 grand new in the first place.

Really stupid question, but does near every stock pay dividends? I had btcgarden for a little less than a week but saw no dividends.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:20:49
Even if it somehow reaches 100k it's only a hundred times more than it is now compared to the increase from 0.004USD to even 300USD let alone 1000USD.

Seems legit.

Oh. My. God. I'm still waiting for my first bank transaction to get to Dwolla. It's been 2-3 weeks since I decided I wanted to trade and took initiative. Now mt gox won't take my Dwolla money without more verification? Is there another way to get USD Into my gox account? I have visa and cash.

When bit coin prices soar up, someone always comments with that text face and says "to the moon!" As in the value of bit coin is going to the moon.

I checked this out, and this is exactly what I was looking for, thanks.

Crap I already moved my BTC to GOX. It said wait 24 hours though :(
@_date: 2013-07-03 17:31:11
Yep, gonna wait until my little dividend comes in today then bust out of bitcoin for now. Bought in at 120 since it seemed really stable and I was fine at it being 100, no big deal. But its down to 80 and not looking promising. Going to cut my losses (which shouldnt be too bad, been getting dividends for months) and buy in later.

[Here]( the rest of the e-mail explaining the procedures. I didn't think to put it in the album with the above link.

You missed the part where it's the rookies profit taking and the veterans delusionally believing we're going to hit $20,000 right now and be sustainable and that people will actually use a currency measured all the way back to 0.0000X. It's just not practical. "Your hotdog will be 0.00001631 btc mam". Even with mBTC, its too confusing and makes it sound like a joke.

It's just weird to me because I haven't been on Gox for a while, and I only do that sort of business on a linux computer that is specifically for that. So I doubt I got keylogged. Does someone get a magical list of usernames and passwords somehow?

Any more info on btc garden? What do they do?

This was my first question when I saw the price at 260$. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:42:26
I'm hitting myself now man. I was all over the Internet in 09 why did I not find anything out about btc. I'm an investor at heart my 17 year old self would've threw a hundred dollars into it. But then again I couldve sold on the way up like at a dollar per btc. I was really interested in mining as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:28:48
What goes up...
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:03:20
Hey I saved this comment a few days ago for future reference. I can't really find a way to buy into these shares. Looks like you need to know somebody to get into asicminer-pt and the RTM thread is a bit confusing. Could you direct me to a place to research the cost of the shares and a place to buy them?
Also, I would think that you could only buy these shares with BTC which the BTC:USD right now is still pretty high so I don't think I can buy very many with the little BTC I have. Do any of them accept USD for their shares? 
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:59:40
Buying high wouldve been me buying in at 260. My only regret is not getting in at 7$ especially since I had extra money at the time. I didnt invest a lot so I'm not losing a lot of money. I don't thibk anybody here can exactly predict whats going to happen short term, all we can do is speculate. I'm sure I wont be kicking myself over cutting losses ans buying even lower than it is now. If it skyrockets from here like everyone here would like to believe then so be it.
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:59:46
Stupid question, but do the profits beat loss through inflation?
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:03:13
Do you have some insider information or a good prediction on this at the moment unstable currency to convince me not to?
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:41:16
Will this have any effect on BTC value?
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:58:45
Problem with investing in any sort of stock is having to register with a trade company, paying ridiculous fees and keeping their bare minimum amount in the account ( a lot of times 2,000$+). To trade bitcoin you just have to go through an unnecessary long validation procedure through Dwolla and have like 45cents (have to trade minimum of like 0.001 bitcoins on mtgox or something) 
If somebody can show me a stock/option trader that I can move my 100 whole dollars I'm willing to risk right now to, be my guest.

Makes sense, what's the down low on labcoin? I visited their website and it's sort of plain, but their shares are dirt cheap.

This is the truth. He can trade for USD and pay taxes for the car along with taxes for earning the USD tax money. Also even though the car will depreciate, a lamborghini will always be a lamborghini. Diablos are still going for around $120,000
