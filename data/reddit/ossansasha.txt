If they are being mined alongside the main chain I'm pretty sure they'll be taking hashpower from said chain, slowing it down even further. In other words I'm pretty sure the end result would at best be the exact same speed, more likely it would result in slower overall speeds.

Consumer electronics in the US alone use 148 TWh/year. Yes, I am concerned, but I think the point of the Bitcoin power argument is to pretend to care about the planet when they really just don't like Bitcoin. To save the planet we need to move to green energy, not kill one comparatively small consumer of electricity. Remember, Bitcoin is global. US consumer electronics are not.

Adjusted template suggestion : 
The fees and transaction times associated with transferring Bitcoin to and from Coinbase accounts have reached levels too high to be compatible with regular use of the currency. I am curious as to why Segregated Witness (Segwit) has yet to be implemented by Coinbase. I prefer using Coinbase because  it makes buying and transferring cryptocurrencies simple, but I can't afford the current network transaction fees nor the time spent waiting for a transaction to be confirmed. Time is money, and if Segwit is not implemented soon I will be forced to take my business to a competing service that supports it.

(1) Just like the NYSE there are exchanges for cryptocurrencies. I have made sell and buy orders both, and they tend to resolve immediately (kinda. It's a bit more complicated than that, but on the exchanges I use I can either wait for transferred funds like USD to be approved and settled, place a purchase, and instantly own and be able to transfer my crypto or : transfer funds and make purchases immediately, have to wait for the funds to be cleared/approved to move my crypto off the exchange).
(2) Transaction costs are kinda high : if I have control over the costs I can move any amount of currency for a small fee (maybe 20 cents + exchange fees, if they exist). Some wallets don't offer that. Security of the transaction is a non-issue due to the nature of the blockchain. Security of my wallet is a different matter : I keep my private key offline to minimize the chance of a hacker picking it up, and keep multiple copies in different places to avoid a data corruption or theft problem. 
(3) I think the volatility of the price makes the "store of value" argument a little silly, despite the growth trend. It is supposed to be a currency, intended for P2P transactions and not as an investment asset. On the other hand the users essentially determine what it is, so given the way people have been treating it I'd argue it is now a moderate-risk investment asset and leave it at that. 
(4) Most of the business owners I know that deal with Bitcoin accept it as a currency based on the average exchange value for the previous calendar day with a slight adjustment to cover potential loss on the exchange. They tend to liquidate the Bitcoin either immediately, once it has risen in value enough to record additional profit, or at the end of a set period (day, week, month, etc). I only know one individual who retains the Bitcoin long-term, and he has been very successful liquidating only enough to acquire the fiat for the transactions with some leftover as a business investment. I would hate to see an audit on that business...
Hope I was helpful!

"There is no real reason that the energy of bitcoin needs to be as high as it is. Its just a function of the rewards given to miners and then supply and demand will ensure that the amount spent on mining (mostly electricity) is close to the rewards from mining."
Yeah, I agree.
"There is a fixed reward per block 12.5 BTC (halving every 4 years) and bitcoin varies the difficulty to regulate each new block to around 1 every 10 minutes."
Uh-huh, that's how it works...
"At the moment the rewards from mining are over $200k per block and over $300million per day - that means a ton of electricity and pollution."
Wait, what? No, huge number of miners = large energy consumption. Dirty energy = pollution. Hence, large number of miners using dirty energy sources = ton of pollution.
"There is no reason the rewards to miners need to be this high - the difficulty level and amount of mining is already far more than is required to keep the network secure."
Yeah, but if the reward was lowered now I wonder what would happen to the hashrate.
"If bitcoin varied the reward to ensure only the required amount of mining was incentivised then it would only require a fraction of what it does / will do as the price rises."
Reward is pretty high, transactions still take a long time. Sounds like they need to increase the reward?
"Hence Bitcoins energy use is excessive compared to what is requires as well as excessive compared to normal alternatives."
I mean, you rambled a lot but didn't really argue your final point save that one point about pollution. And excessive compared to normal alternatives is a stretch... The US alone uses more power on electronic devices in standby mode than the entire blockchain uses on mining. The funny thing about statistics is you can manipulate the lens the reader is considering the statistics from. The energy consumption for Bitcoin mining considered the entire network, as in internationally, then compared it to a (small) country. That is misleading at best, gross negligence at worst.

On the flip side I think you'll have trouble finding someone to agree. It would be easy for you to tell Paypal that the transaction was fraudulent, and since Paypal has shown a history of siding with buyers over sellers (buyer meaning you are sending the money) you could have the BTC and get all your money back. I've been on the receiving end of that before (my Paypal account is still locked because of that POS)

I hope I'm not wrong on this (someone will correct me if I am, I'm sure) but I understand that you can move Bitcoin both directions : i.e. from normal to Segwit AND from Segwit back to normal.

What's the same between all the things listed? They don't operate as money. They are goods or investments that typically won't be directly exchanged for goods or services.
What does Bitcoin have that they don't? It is money. Plain and simple.
Is it a bubble/will it pop? Yeah, probably. But that isn't a bad thing. Currencies experience corrections that adjust the PPP to market-accepted levels. This is normal. Will Bitcoin crash like the other currencies? As long as it can operate as money (looking at you high mining fees and slow transaction times) then it will continue to have value according to the people who value ownership and control of personal finances with comparatively high anonymity for transactions. In other words I expect it won't ever completely devalue provided the network continues to integrate new methods and technologies to allow the speed of transactions to remain relatively high with comparatively low transaction fees while the number of transactions skyrockets or plummets. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:23:20
The answer is 0 because you panic sell when you think the price is about to crash, and then wait for a dip to buy back in but that dip never comes and you just keep waiting and hoping but it's too late and now we're on the moon but you're still on the launchpad hoping we'll come back down so you can get on board.

Interesting you say that, considering any app you download is being hosted online. I get what you are saying though, so here is my counter argument :
With Coinbase they have my private keys. If they wanted to rip my coins away they have that power.
With an off-exchange wallet I have my private keys. Unless my wallet is compromised I don't have to worry. 
It depends on whether you feel comfortable letting a company hold the keys to your accounts or not. As for security, I feel significantly more secure downloading an open-source wallet (so I can verify the code) from a reputable website and verifying the checksums to make sure my download wasn't corrupted. Ideally I'd program my own wallet, but I haven't read enough documentation to achieve that yet. Maybe that can be my New Year's resolution!
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:39:45
No, it doesn't. Scarcity from an economic perspective is not quantifiable. What is quantifiable is supply and demand, which are the driving factors behind price determination in a true free market economy. The only way for a demand and supply to exist is for scarcity to exist, meaning there is a limited amount so it has a value that can be determined through supply and demand models that account for the number of buyers and sellers and the type of good, which in turn help identify the supply and demand, which in turn identifies the efficient sale price. Without an existing scarcity the good would have no value, which is why no one is trying to sell you something like "breathing air, sourced locally". That is a readily available good with no scarcity so it has no economic value. Bitcoin has scarcity because only a specific amount can exist. The value is determined by a combination of what sellers are willing to accept and what buyers are willing to pay. This is literally Microeconomics 101 (202 at my college for no good reason I have determined). 
Arguing it is a moot point, and I'm drunk and exhausted so I need to sign off for the evening (resident of Japan. It's 1:39 AM). Economic scarcity has a collegiate definition that exists for the purpose of working within the study of economics, which lends itself extraordinarily well to understanding the valuation of cryptocurrencies and any good you would buy in a free market economics-based society. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:19:16
By the economic definition, yeah exactly. Scarcity doesn't mean you specifically can't get it, just that there isn't enough for everyone to have as much as they want. That is what creates value.

The math on that really means the cost of running the entire blockchain, as in all the nodes and miners, is roughly $20/transaction.

Because we live in comparatively competent countries where centralization has "worked" so far. Honestly I like centralization for some things, and I really like having a centralized currency available for use because I probably won't have to worry about the purchasing parity suddenly dropping or skyrocketing (then again, I'm a resident of Japan with apprehensions about the Tokyo Olympics in 2020). 
I'm guilty of using Bitcoin (and a small dabble in others) as an investment myself, but I would like to see a stabilized value so I don't wind up like the people who bought drugs or pizza prior to Mt. Gox. That's honestly what keeps me from spending... I don't want to regret it later.

You haven't taken an economics class then. That's why I said "by definition". If there isn't an infinite amount it is, by an economic definition, scarce because there is a possibility that there won't be enough to meet the demand. If the world's population all demanded 1 Bitcoin there wouldn't be enough to supply the demand AND the price would be absolutely insane.

@_date: 2017-11-16 12:18:29
I have seen so many posts asking about this exact thing. The majority consensus is don't spend money you don't have.
Here is my alternate take on it : as someone who works in business companies take out loans to fund capital investments (PP&amp;E typically). These investments are typically for something the company needs but can't rationally afford to pay all at once for. Cryptocurrencies do not fit the bill for an investment financed by a debt.
On the other hand, if the price increases by 50% and you sell your cash value from the loan is now $750 - initial loan - accrued interest, so you come out on top and can reinvest the profit (or keep the profit in crypto). 
Devil's advocate : if the price falls by 50% and you sell you are still on the hook for $250 plus interest on the initial loan. 
There isn't a way to accurately track how the market for cryptocurrencies will change, so it is an extremely high-risk investment that cannot see any returns until some of that investment is liquidated to pay back the loan.
I don't recommend doing this, but if you are going to anyway make sure you plan it out properly. For $500 plan it out as though you are going to buy $100 worth of cryptocurrencies every month for 6 months (always over-plan expenses, hence the $600 total), and make sure you can afford to spend that money. If you can, by all means take a gamble. Celebrate if you make it. Just be an adult about it and don't complain if your purchasing plan fails you.

Well if my understanding is correct reaching the cap means miners receive diminished rewards so the hashrate could decrease. The decrease in performance caused by miners shifting to a "fresh seam" could cause realized value to decrease through increased transaction times (like what Bitcoin is dealing with now) but at the same time the fixed Bitcoin in existence could theoretically increase demand as well. At that point I expect the value of fiat paid into Bitcoin would affect the value instead, similar to how the UAE keeps their exchange rate fixed by banking it on the USD (sorry, I forgot the macroeconomic term for setting a currency value on another currency). I honestly wonder if this won't be the biggest hurdle for cryptocurrencies to overcome...
Specifically fiat currencies have a more stable value because they are attached to the value of goods. Inflation affects the amount said fiat can buy, but in comparison a set number of Big Macs is usually equal to a set number of Starbucks Caramel Macchiatos because both companies adjust prices to reflect inflation. Bitcoin doesn't seem to have any goods that are priced to a value of Bitcoin, so the value seems predominantly determined by demand (more like a publicly traded stock than a currency). I worry that this will wind up being the final deciding factor for the future of Bitcoin.
Then again I'm EXTREMELY new to cryptocurrencies (only 1 week in) so take my opinion with a grain of salt
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:18:37
To build on your contributions :
1. Neither is the money in a bank account or on a credit card. Both are digital representations of the money available to a person, except when a bank is in charge of the digital ledger they can deny access to the funds.
2. Fiat isn't backed by gold either, by definition. If it was it would be a commodity-based currency. 
3. All currency is used for crime. Suggesting Bitcoin is bad because some criminals accept it is similar to suggesting we should abandon the USD because it can be used to buy heroin and cocaine.
Another fantastic point to suggest is that Bitcoin itself is a border-less currency in that you don't have to convert it into a local currency to trade with it. As long as both parties have a wallet, the seller accepts Bitcoin, and the buyer has Bitcoin an exchange of goods or services for currency can occur. 
Bitcoin is also resistant to a particular type of banking failure : banks issue loans on the money being stored in the bank (i.e. your savings account). The loaned money is "created" by loaning it out, and the bank makes profits on the interest. The money multiplier principle can explain this far better than I.
Problem with the loaning is if there is a run on the bank (everyone trying to withdraw all their money/close their accounts all at once) then there is a good chance the bank won't be able to pay out what is owed. Granted there are conditions and regulations in place to try and prevent this possibility, at least in the US, but Bitcoin doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is, however, highly volatile and the value could drop to a few cents per Bitcoin overnight. 
That is where a centralized currency overseen by a competent government has an advantage : it isn't likely the people under the government will suddenly abandon the local currency for another currency. The same argument could be made for Bitcoin, but I think it is more likely for the crypto-community to jump ship to an altcoin than it is for the US population to switch to the Euro.

My transactions always go through fine, even during the chaos surrounding the cancelled fork (9 days later, but it still happened). It's a lot better to put fiat into the account and use that to purchase BTC. Then you can receive your coin immediately. Still need to wait 5-7 business days for the funds though (bank ACH transfers are just the best, aren't they?)

Well it comes back to supply and demand. There is a much higher demand for original art than a reproduction, generally speaking, so the original (of which there will only ever be one) is highly valued while the replications (which can easily number in the millions or more and be produced by anyone with a source image and a printer) won't have anywhere near the same value.
On the other hand the art world is famously pretentious and just awful when it comes to valuing anything. There have been several amateur artists who created nonsense or just bad paintings, claimed they were made by some dude they made up, and then even some of the art buffs will claim to know how respected and valued the imaginary painter's work is. They do that because, like the hipster community, ignorance is a sin so it's better to fake "being in the know" and to lie than to admit never having heard of someone who might be a big deal.

Welcome to Dr. Sasha's office. Would you care to talk about what's REALLY bothering you?
Seriously though, I fail to understand the animosity here. Some people have had success, are excited, and want to help others succeed too. That isn't a bad thing, and of course you can't predict BTC with any competent degree of accuracy. Prices fluctuate all the time. All of this is a gamble in the long run, so why not let the BTC traders have fun. 
I, on the other hand, have made over 6 figures through BTC day-trading. Buy my book to learn industry secrets and subscribe to my podcast to be the first to hear when the next big buy and sell opportunities are coming! Then use your significant profits to contribute to my Patreon so I can continue to take your money while feeding you bullshit!

The US is a very interesting case. A small handful of huge corporations control the internet access for the country that developed the internet. What is worrying is that the end of Net Neutrality could allow those corporations to selectively throttle or kill US-based nodes, forcing them to turn to a competing service that could in turn decide the available bandwidth shouldn't be allocated to Bitcoin nodes. It could take the US off the blockchain, but that is rather unlikely.
I think a lot of people believe in the free market but don't realize how easy it is for a monopoly to control said market, or how high the barriers to entry are in that particular market. If it was fully privatized I bet the current companies would own all the infrastructure and blatantly refuse to allow any possible competition to use it. At that point the only feasible option is for a startup/rival to invest in the necessary infrastructure to compete (good luck getting onto anything at that point).
Personally I think the US system for internet access is completely broken from the perspective of a free market, and only the government assigning infrastructure to individual companies without being influenced by lobbyists and money will fix it (i.e. SOL). 
On the other hand, bitcoin as a whole will survive (again, economics isn't the study of you but the study of the market. The Bitcoin market is global). Net neutrality in this context only refers to the US (for now). I feel confident that there are better places to talk about this than the global bitcoin subreddit

I read it, but I had already read the Reddit thread it referenced. That's really what irritated me most, that and after the developer (assumedly) posted in the thread that the change notes had been modified for accuracy no one bothered talking about it. The example the redditor gave was also flawed logic. Both wallets have the same address by default, so it doesn't matter which coin you send. It will go to the proper wallet automatically.
Sorry, when I said "That's really what irritated me the most..." what I meant was "why does the (unresearched) opinion of a person on Reddit matter?" It screams sensationalism to me, and I believe that anyone who took 5 minutes to check it out themselves would agree.
That being said I still won't use it. I do think it's unfair to attack them with negative app reviews claiming "scam!" based solely off the evidence and opinions that were presented.

They do indeed! Here are the facts if you download the app on an Android :
*After installation the app gives a brief history of Bitcoin, using the acronym BTC and the BTC prices.
*The wallet creates two wallets, very clearly labeled as Bitcoin Cash Wallets and Bitcoin Wallets. 
*They use the same address, so receiving is extremely simple, even for the technologically illiterate.
The only reason someone would claim this is a malicious attack on Bitcoin, or that it was a "bait and switch", is to spread FUD through the propaganda machine and keep the Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash war going as long as possible. Anyone who downloads the app themselves to check will know immediately that someone is trying to make something out of nothing.
Do your own due diligence. Think for yourself. Don't be a pawn for someone else's propaganda attack.

But wealth inequality is one of the driving factors behind a free market system. Everyone is encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth, allowing them to purchase better stuff. If you take away the inequality then you have a system in place that no longer encourages harder work with a monetary incentive.
The problem a deflationary fiat currency has is the smallest unit of measure that is accepted, specifically because that smallest unit can prove to have too much purchasing power to buy a cup of coffee. The current smallest unit of measure in Bitcoin is 1 Satoshi, and the white paper even mentions that this does not have to be the smallest unit. The currency can further divide or, I know this sounds strange but bear with me, be exchanged for fiat or an altcoin with a lower value for smaller transactions. This essentially removes the issue of the smallest unit of measure potentially reaching a value too high to be practically used for minor transactions.
The same concept also solves the "lost bitcoin" problem. As long as the currency is being traded a particular amount will exist that can be exchanged. If the amount in circulation decreases too much then the speculative value will increase based on the logic of significantly decreased supply, which would then demand a solution like a unit smaller than the Satoshi to allow the exchange of currency to continue. The big hodlers that don't spend can, for the purposes of this reasoning, also be considered "dead coin hodlers" because the end result (coins removed from circulation) is still the same.
Honestly it seems the big disconnect you and I have about this is how Bitcoin should be used. You lament that people are treating it like a gold-backed fiat, and I submit that you are still treating it like a traditional currency. Bitcoin (and many of the altcoins) is decentralized (not under the control of financial institutions) and is not a physical tender. Those two points are extremely important because they indicate a separation from traditional fiat currency that is more akin to a global bartering system. The coin is worth what everyone agrees it is worth, not what the financial complex decides it is worth. There are enough differences that cryptocurrencies should be analyzed from a different perspective, probably one that hasn't yet been published or fully conceived.
Really I'm saying the problems are non problems, as long as you stop thinking about it as a traditional currency. Fees are what keep miners processing the blockchain, so there will be times where the fees are too high for a small transaction; that is a necessary evil to ensure stability. If the market has decided bitcoin is better used as a large-value international investment, and you are in the minority of people who want to use it as a day-to-day currency, then take a moment and read up on how changes are supposed to be implemented as outlined in Satoshi's whitepaper. This is a mob-rule system, but there are altcoins who are 100% on board with you. 
Use them instead. Use the coin that gives you the best utility instead of the coin you like the name of. Honestly I can't imagine why you would use Bitcoin if another coin meets your particular needs better, and that is exactly how a free market is supposed to work. This isn't like a government where everyone gets the same one, so it has to try and appeal to everyone (or not, politics). This can appeal to whoever the market wants it to appeal to, and it will. The hate between the coins only demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of free market economics and, frankly, looks immature. 
Almost as immature as writing 6 paragraphs as a response to a post on Reddit. :-p

Once it stabilizes and is used as a currency, I think.
Reflecting on a recent interaction where I was invited to give an introduction to Bitcoin to an undergraduate business class, I realized the reason people refer to Bitcoin as a Ponzi Scheme is because one of the most exciting things to talk about is the incredible value increase. This leads people to think of Bitcoin as an asset that increases in value as more people buy into it, and thus would decrease in value as it is abandoned or as people cash out. The best way to talk about it would have been to use the value as a proof of acceptance, and instead to focus on and keep the conversation on the merits of P2P currency and the blockchain.

I've also heard that mining is an economy of scale : i.e. as you increase the number of miners the ratio of total power consumption : miner decreases, up until it comes out on the other side where the farm is generating profits instead of losses. As long as mining income &gt; power bills the cost of the equipment can pay for itself. The next costs to worry about would be the space required, insurance costs on the building, etc. If the economy of scale is true eventually only the biggest mining farms would be able to turn a profit, probably...
On the other hand it might be useful to consider the mindset of a miner. Perhaps the miner is thinking long-term instead of short-term, or has something else going that is offsetting the power costs (like a separate business or something). The mining income might be considered an investment, where the miner is hoping for/ expecting a jump in BTC value. 
To address your concerns Bitcoin will likely need to consider the blockchain architecture and try to find a way to reduce power consumption. That will all depend on the market

I think the fork was scheduled for 2 blocks prior**. I don't know the technical aspects as well as I wish I did, but I would assume no. 
Logically the fork would begin the instant the block was found because that block would essentially be carrying any potential transactions for the forked currency. If your transaction was sitting on said block then your coins wouldn't have been in your desired wallet prior to the fork so you shouldn't be getting the coins.
** I stand corrected. Apparently the nodes failed 2 blocks prior to the fork.

No. The plan AFAIK was to integrate Segwit2x but still leave room for those who didn't want the change. That would have been the original fork, but the "leaders" called it off. Other individuals decided to proceed regardless, because you can absolutely do that, and it failed. 
So to answer your question, the implementation was the same but the adopting scale was extremely* different.

That article feels dated and ignorant. 
The issue is developing a secure, decentralized upgrade takes time and effort. The point is to create a system that benefits everyone. Satoshi didn't write and submit his whitepaper in a month, that took a lot of time, effort, and consideration. Implementing the ideas laid forth took additional time, effort, and consideration simply because conceiving of an idea and creating the idea are two different things.
Yes some of the technologies used at the moment seem like obvious solutions, but they are still new and fresh and the actual implications of the new technologies has yet to be fully understood by all. Taking time to polish the ideas into practical, working code is extremely important, especially when money is on the line. The old idiom goes something like "if you are going to do something, take your time and do it right." 
As for the claim that businesses won't jive with the long transaction times, guess what? I work for a Japanese company that outsources production and raw material acquisition to foreign countries. Our payment methods are ACH (5-7 business days) and, occasionally, Western Union (God only knows when it will be processed). Then we have to navigate payments around international holidays, which (looking at YOU China) can sometimes mean the accounting team is off for an entire week. 
Businesses typically work by a "You owe me this. Sign this. Pay me by this date. If you pay me this much earlier we will discount your order by this much" model that often extends for weeks, more often months. A few days to wait for a B2B transaction is nothing, we already have to wait longer.
This article should have focused on the consumer-side and how businesses are reluctant to adopt a decentralized currency. If our money in the bank is stolen, we are insured up to a certain amount. If our Bitcoin is stolen it's gone. That is the big obstacle to overcome (besides grumpy old men who shun new technology running the companies).
