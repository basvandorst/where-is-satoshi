Yup, the way you talk about Gox victims will really help Bitcoin become the medium of exchange of the future. We're talking about millions of dollars and a little baby troll like you comes on here spewing your faggot talk. That'll get people on board.

**Didn't you get the updated list of Robocoin requirments?**
Robocoins Orwellian requirements for buyers... Palm scans + Drivers License + Background check + Photo, WTF. Robocoin, This is NOT what Bitcoin is about. Then I remembered, [DIY Open-Source Bitcoin ATM (approx $500)](
 
**Sorry Robocoin, but you don't deserve to be in this business. And hopefully the free market will drive you out.**
Then me and my friends started posting the "latest" Robocoin requirements on facebook, here's just a few:
* how about an anal probe while theyre at it, colonoscopy anyone?
* psychiatric evaluation
* DNA sample, please.
* a picture of your daughters
* and your wife
* Hair follicles.
* a picture of your last turd
* fecal matter scan
* a picture of your dads butthole scanned in 1080p resolution
* Mandatory GPS tracking belt w/ picture of your wife's vagina for good measure.
* a zip lock bag of your underage sisters pubic hairs
* a sample of your tears after Robocoin comes and rapes your whole family
* Retinal scan plus 10 year slave contract.
* One way mandatory ticket to North Korea, no give backs
* Proof of identity and proof of time served in North Korean gulag.
* Place one amputated finger in the finger recepticle, MUST HAVE BEEN bitten off while in a gulag to prevent frostbite from spreading, like [The Zec from Jack Reacher.](
* Buyers must submit verbal and written expressions of their profound, unyielding devotion and loyalty to the CEO of Robocoin, video footage of familial worship sessions dedicated to the CEO of Robocoin (must show occurrence on a regular basis), a statement on behalf of buyer's wife expressing a willingness to engage in sexual activity with the CEO of Robocoin at any moment at which they are called upon, and a copy of their photo ID with proof of recent anal probing by Robocoin-certified rectal examination outlets.
* [Butters Therapy](
* Hahahaha you dudes are too much. But seriously whats a palm scan?
* Blueprint of your home, keys to your home, keys to any vehicles you own, daily log of your children's whereabouts and activities, your internet browser history, written statement of your political ideology and affiliations, agreement to have a surveillance system installed in your home and workplace, 19 references, disclosure of your email and social networking passwords, pictures of your birthmarks, your work schedule, urinalysis, anal probing, retinal scan, palm scan, butt scan, finger nail clippings, hair follicles, x-rays, pictures of your pets, names and addresses of anyone you have ever communicated with, submission to regular wiretapping, copies of your text messages, your driver's license, access to your life savings account, access to your thoughts.
* Biologic and chemical agent guinea pig testing, must have your testicles removed surgically and be sterilized before submitting your application, your wife's underwear straight out of the hamper, worn for no less than 3 days. 3 generations of slavery (your grand kids) (Literally happens in North Korea) as well as your mom and dad. They will be forced to work the fields for 20 years hard labor. These terms may change as needed. THEN you may or may not receive your bitcoins.
* Users must relocate to and apply for citizenship in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Attempts to defect will result in closure of your Robocoin account, seizure of all of your assets, and a bounty will be placed upon you and your family's lives for a total reward of $5,000,000. If this is the case, bounty hunters may receive an additional bonus reward if they provide proof of torture via needles being forced under your fingernails and into your eyeballs prior to execution.
* Robocoin reserves the right to mercilessly beat your grandma.
Feel free to add to the list, that way we can make Robocoin ATMs the safest yet! ;)

It would definitely help the reputation of Bitcoin for the average person in the world who is scared to invest or use bitcoin because of all the hacks and horror stories. Sadly, that's what bitcoin has become to people who aren't part of the community. All they ever hear is bad news from the mainstream media. And it is stifling Bitcoin's progress. They don't understand the concept of storing your bitcoins locally, using 2fa, encryption and cold storage. All they see is people getting robbed whether by their own negligence or not. If people saw Mt.Gox users get bailed out by the market itself, it would bring a lot of confidence to this little social experiment of ours. And it doesn't need to be a charity case, there's plenty of money to be made in the long term by anyone who gets there hands dirty on this. Gox was once top dog, owning a piece of it before it gets remade into a fully functional, cutting edge, open and transparent exchange could be very profitable to investors. With totally new management and a new PR and support department.
We could even see a majority public opinion of the mainstream population that has more faith in Bitcoin than any Fiat. You'd never see such a community effort/rescue on this scale with USD. When investors get conned and the government has to step in and sort things out, they usually get pennies on the dollar for the victims, IF anything at all. Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) still owes his victims around $100 Million!! The initial restitution he was ordered to pay was $110 Million. This is not only an investment in an incompetent company that dug there own hole. This is an investment in the full faith and credit of Bitcoin itself. This would show the world what kind of system we have here.
**If Core Devs, founders, early adopters, and other major exchanges/players (Yes even Gox competitors, considering they would buy out Gox and each have a stake of equity, akin to a tech start-up being bought out by Facebook/Google/Yahoo/ect and then sometimes even shut down right after being bought just to kill the competition) could get together and sit down in a room with Mark and Gox Staff, get to the bottom of exactly what happened in detail, and come up with a plan to reimburse all account holders. This could salvage the situation for us. Don't do it for Mark or for Mt.Gox the company, DO IT FOR US and do it for the huge profitability potential of owning a piece of the first major Bitcoin exchange. Re-brand Gox and let Mark step down and retire.**
As someone who took a hit with this Gox situation, I still wouldn't want to see regulation on Bitcoin, even if it meant I could be reimbursed everything I lost. But I don't know how much more of these horrible nightmare situations I can witness before I dump everything and forget about Bitcoin for good. Decentralized, anonymity, freedom. That's the whole point of Bitcoin... It is these principles that made it so amazing. A true and total free market. Without that, it cannot function as it was supposed to.

I have no idea what relevance that has to what I posted. But yah let me just add my own coin to the thousand others on the list that dilute the market and make Bitcoin look like a joke. Nobodys coming up with anything truly original, all just working off the source code of one mans genius.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:46:30
another one of you guys. ive been reading posts like this to people who had money on Gox for weeks now. you attack noobs who had everything on Gox. Way to make the Bitcoin community a nice place to be. Unlike them I didn't have everything tied up in Gox but I did take a hit, and what I did lose I had been trying to get out of there for months. You want to talk that shit on here fine, i dont give a fuck. But stop trolling noobs. And you and your balls can go fuck yourself.

make sure you have javascript enabled and make sure your computers time is correct, sync it on the internet time tab to one of the servers
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:46:36
I am all for this except for the fact that this is all conjecture because fat fuck won't give us any information on what's actually going on. For all we know this isn't even close to the problem.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:27:54
And apparently they have the worst support. I still use it but I never keep any funds on BTC-e, that's a scary scary one. BTC-e is like musical chairs. Don't be caught on there when shit hits the fan. Considering the amount of money these exchanges are making from fees alone, it's a wonder to me that BTC-E wouldn't want to be more open and have a better support staff. With the money they're making you could buy a team of devs to create a really nice support system.

Mr. Karpeles, please be careful with those programs. We're counting on you

I personally use Mt.Gox, it's the best exchange out there right now. You should send all your money there
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:53:18
thats last weeks story breh, how long are we all going to have to hear that shit. I must have read that same troll talk 100 times on a lot of peoples posts. It's getting old and nobody gives a fuck. It's time to move forward and see what can be done to make people whole. None of the shit you say is productive in any way. "They" were warned for months. Fuck are you talking about, not everybody checks up on reddit and bitcoin forums. Esp the people we are trying to attract into this technology. And nobody said anything about the rest of us bailing them out.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:01:37
You make a good point. If it's better in the end to stay quiet about certain things in the event that it would be better if things get worked out in the end. I really fucking hope he said 744,408 are there. But I really don't trust the source of any of this information. It looks to me like were all fucked. But if he said 744k coins are still there just not accessible, If that's the case there's still a chance that this entire thing can be salvaged. But then again, even if he did say that it's probably another lie to keep his shit running as long as he can before the law catches up to him or worse.

I'm not moving on. I have a lot of money on Gox. That fat fuck better get to work and get things up and running again. I dont care how
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:49:57
If this is the case... which i doubt it is, probably another stalling tactic. I cannot believe this fat fucking moron would put 700k+ coins in one wallet and throw away the key. Who knew all along we were dealing with a complete and total moron. I mean we knew he was incompetent but this is beyond fucking retarded.

@_date: 2014-02-20 21:14:29
It would look like thousands of people from all over the world crying out for blood. Internet lynch mobs of noobs and veterans alike. The US and Japanese Government will likely not do anything and there will likely be no recourse for investors since Bitcoin technically doesn't exist. I can see Mark Karpeles going into hiding akin to the Osama Bin Laden of the cryptocurrency world.
inSOLVENT implies that there is no SOLUTION. Looking at the numbers and doing the math right now. You could give me Mt.Gox as it stands right now at this very moment, and also under the assumption that there is no money at all, in either BTC or Fiat left, and I could turn out a couple million by just myself and staff withdrawing BTC from my exchange and dumping it on others and then pumping it back into Gox. Just off the Bitcoins and Fiat coming in this week from people eager to take advantage of the cheap BTC.
