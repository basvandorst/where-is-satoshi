It's the cryptocorrency equivalent of bear sterns going tits up.  Even parts of that were sold off as a going concern. What's lacking in Gox's case is a bail out. Not a bailout in currency or Bitcoin but a bailout from the rest of the community. Dev support, tech support, testing and PR(damage control at this stage). If the whole community doesn't want to be tarred in a post apocalyptic 'bankster' light fir the next 6 years then they should pool together to resolve the gox crisis while the still can. It's what will define Bitcoin and it's users as revolutionary rather than whining money grabbing fools

Still a scam until he releases the shares and refunds customers money for non delivery of products.
There's a little part of me that is glad that money was stolen from me to produce these fans.

A Lot of people have been waiting for their orders to ship for 11 days now.
Something is certainly not right about this company.

Yes, if he's wanting to sell BTC but suggests to the market that he wants to buy 200k it moves the price up (if people beleive him) and then he sells into the spike up.    
He sells then the market goes down again when it realises the offer was not forthcoming.  
In any case, people should not go off hearsay and only speculate on what's on the order book as an indication of price.  People have been talking up or down markes ever since they were invented.  
BTC will be exactly worth what people perceive it to be. Seeing like it can't be manipulated* or insider traded or front runned by brokers acting on behalf of clients then it's more fair than current market systems. 
*can only be manipulated by people with $mega by buying steadily over time and then selling all at a low price to create a crash.  or just suddenly placing an order for 400k and spiking the price up - which would then go back down to sustainable levels.
This is where options and volatility trading come into play longer term- i.e. you can buy insurance against large falls or speculate on the volatility of the exchange rates.

why is there an illuminati triangle with the all seeing eye on your indigogo page?

if its not broken why fix it? ANd why don't you just create your own competing coin from the current branch of bitcoin and implement this as, "FastCoin" ?
