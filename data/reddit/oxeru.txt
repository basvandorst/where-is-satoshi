I heard a *theory* that a bunch of whales bought in before futures go live and plan to short bitcoin. I can't speak to if it's true or not, but certainly scary 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:51
I hope so and coinbase better not be down when it happens 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:51:53
I'm obviously talking about the live price. The live price is not affected by day or hour selection on the respective charts 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:59:40
Obviously this sub does 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:23:26
Bitcoin is similar to gold in that it's a store of value. The price will initially drop and then once people realize it's easily accessible way to storing value within a short time the price will rebound and likely go way up
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:15:49
I made a spreadsheet that tracks some basic stats. I plan to add more to it eventually, but I'd be happy to link a blank one here if you would like 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:54:50
Explain please?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:39:22
Ok old man let's break this down.


Obligatory lmao. So for a while this might have been true. The community is plagued by the actions of the minority as is the case in many communities. Since ~2014 maybe a little earlier this idea that BTC is just a way for assists to get a fix is false. 


Anything that anyone deems to have value is by definition a real currency. If the weird kid down the block wants to buy dirt from me then dirt is by definition a currency. 


That because right now that's no the primary goal. Right now it is a store of value that isn't very good at small day-to-day transactions. There are **many** people working on scaling this issue. 
Bitcoin however is vastly superior to "traditional" currencies at cross-border and very large exchanges of money. One of the best in-fact


Why does gold have value?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:43
Bad mentality bro. Need some balance in your life. All optimism needs a shed of doubt 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:42:24
Likely some whale activity not what the public as a whole wants. Very worrying 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:54:01
Is there a way to speed up the time it takes to buy coins from coinbase? I've been waiting 8 days for this order. It's completely unusable to any kind of short term trading from what I can tell.
I was using my bank account BTW to buy 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:10:21
Great advice thanks. It doesn't make sense yet with the level of trading I do to buy my own machine but I will certainly consider that as I get more into crypto currencies 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:11:33
Yeah "most hate" is subjective, sorry. I say that from reading around on here some, some vocal users call out others for using coinbase and I was wondering why, if it's a meme or something. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:56:34
Alright thanks. Will look into it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:47
On the way down big man. But I'm in stupid for not buying the hype right? Lmao. You don't have to respond because I know it's embarrassing, but if you did the research you told me to do you would know that unchecked growth isn't possible without prompting. There is *almost* always a correction of time type.
See me buy this dip out 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:53:04
That's not the question. When that is reached why would people continue to put up with the volatility? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:14
Dude I'm pissed too
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:25
I literally to the T did the exact same thing. This is pretty fucked that there hasn't been a correction yet. FOMO is setting in hard for me
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:34:49
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:48
I've heard GDAX was down too.
Coinbase, Gemini, GDAX were the 3 I kept seeing as down 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:33:19
I was using coinbase for a while and skirted around the 18 age limit because I never verified my ID until like 4 days ago (Just my luck because I was going to buy the fuck out of that dip).
Anyway they locked my account (again right before that sweet dip) and im looking for a new place to buy as well. Ill see if I can skirt around gemini as well
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:31
I don't even know what to say to this. You're so uninformed it's painful. Go online right now and spend about 30 mins looking up the facts come back and tell me if you still agree with everything you have said so far. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:42
Hold that though lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:36:26
2 reasons
1) They're "technologically illiterate" and I would rather not have them involved. 
They flipped their shit when I offhandedly mentioned that I got locked out of my coinbase account (Roth before the sweet dip I was going to buy RIP) and it took me a solid 2 hours to calm them down and explain that the money is fine and I can move it etc
2) The market is very volatile as we all know. I don't want to have the hassle of having to call them up or something if I need to move money or exchange some coins etc.
It's just simpler for me to have full control of this
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:34:25
This sub is filled with shitposts and memes, which is fine, but I'm asking for real information is what i was trying to convey
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:11
Here's the problem with that. If bitcoin turns out to be a bubble and bursts the press will rake it through the coals. Seriously if bitcoin crashes hard it's going to be bad. As a result the entire crypto market will be slandered and all coins prices will drop as a result.
This sudden drop only causes further speculation and the prices of all coins continues downward. 
This market in particular is tough to invest in as a whole because it's so linked with one real name and that's bitcoin. Bitcoin is the buzzword for this market and its price has influence on the market as a whole  
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:27
STOP.TALKING omg. Take the 30 minutes I said and go do research. I as the random Internet man can't explain this to you in a way you'll believe. Seriously. Go get the facts and come back
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:54:09
Obviously I'm not referring to some shithole country's money lol. And that's true if it gets that widespread it should slow in theory I guess
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:53:04
I have a bank account, credit card and PayPal all in USD. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:04:54
That's true about people wanting to move away from a "normal" currency. In my original post I mean ruined stable currency referring to most western country's currency's as the example. 
There obviously exists high amounts of volatility in more traditional currencies
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:11
All of it 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:52:26
No offense, but that's ignorant to say that. First of all it's NOT always positive upward trend, there have and are massive double digit drops over a single day sometimes 
Second, upward volatility is not good. It is not sustainable and can cause speculation and eventually a massive crash.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:30:17
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:36:00
Obviously if I send in a pic of my ID they'll know my age lmao. I'm just stating that they don't ask for SSNs usually 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:15
It's ignorant to assume the value will simply keep going up
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:56:43
Interesting points. I'm HODLing bitching right now, riding the wave some. I plan to pullout eventually and reevaluate my positions in this market as a whole. 
I will look at ripple for sure later 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:11
!remind me 1 hour
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:58
Obviously coinbase isn't bitcoin tf? And if you spread money across a bunch of exchanges you haven't accomplished anything. Best practice is to not use an exchange and simply from from your own device.
- Safer
- Faster
- Cheaper fees potentially 
I haven't yet because I'm lazy. But after this fuck coinbase exchange. I lost 7% because I wasn't able to buy at 8,700
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:39:11
Do you think I could skirt by using Gemini for a few months till I'm legal? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:28
About -20mins 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:21
See me on that shit too
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:21:22
I've never seen any ask for SSN. They generally ask for pictures of IDs
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:03
I want to panic but bro! Coinbase as as 8,700 DAMNIT. I can't fucking buy 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:43
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:32
Do you understand that this will hinder competition even more? 2/3 of American house holds have 1(ONE) ISP to choose from because of a bunch of other regulations. The ISPs could simply decide to block all bitcoin websites and fuck us all of they wanted 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:17:01
Having NN the way it is leaves you alone. If it gets repealed you will get charged more for the same services and have your connection throttled and sites blocked.
Having NN classes at a title 2 utility makes it the same as using water. You simply get charged for how much you use not what you use it for.
If we change internet to water water providers could decide to make water for washing dishes cost more than water for watering plants or not allow certain types of faucets because they have their own faucet company they want you to use. 
If you want to be left alone then you support NN
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:25
Then how do you not understand how backwards this is? 2/3 of Americans have one single ISP. There is no competition. Repealing NN will not suddenly fix that. Other legislation needs to be adjusted.
These ISPs have interests. Almost all of them own or are owned by other companies with various political and economic goals. They will manipulate what we see and charge us up the ass for it.
You seem like a republican(I am too) so if for nothing else you should support NN for the fact that the mainstream has been pushing us aside for years now. Liberals own the vast majority of companies and with the repeal of NN they will have the ability to silence republican speech and growth.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:45:53
Right now if someone gets into bitcoin based of this massive increase (and people will) it's called buying into the hype. Or in other words a bubble. How large I can't say. The technology behind BTC is pretty solid so maybe not as large as the .com burst, but there has to be a correction soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:35
Well I would but coinbase is down for whatever the fuck reason. Not acceptable if you ask me. I'll be moving to another site once I get back home 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:16:02
That's what I'm saying. Not that the general price will go up, but these 20% in 2 days shit isn't sustainable. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:07:42
!reddit silver
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:47
I was able to get a buy in at 9,800. Fucking stupid that it's down though. I'm moving exchanges for sure after this nonsense 
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:01:59
Yes very old. I appreciate the response though. I literally will be 18 next week so doesn't really matter now haha

Thanks, I was looking for the googlefinance tag with no success. I eventually just used an IMPORTHTML and this website that I found with more info than google. It also updates more frequently.
 the I am absolutely like you. I am going to have this sheet loaded with so much more. 
And the end-end game is to have my own app with a lot of different functions all related to BTC.
- I want it to have a feed that loads articles from a list of publishers any time bitcoin is used
- To use that data from my sheet to create graphs 
- Store a BTC wallet from my own app on my phone 
- Soooo much more
I'm using this as an excuse to learn about a lot of things as well. I had to learn how to instal a VM on my computer to run Xcode, and right now I'm learning how to use that.
If any of that sounds convoluted it's because it is. Just know that I'm having a damn good time with it!
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:40:11
Looking for some feedback. I plan to expand the chart a good bit and polish it up. Just threw together in about 4 hours(don't judge). 
If you guys are interested as I develop I could release a public version. Just let me know

- Some math is not correct/finished
- Polish is bad

You can say that about any company on a long enough timeline. Same goes for currencies crypto or real. However much you miss peaks and dips by is lost profit. Idc if you bought at $100 a coin. Selling at 4000 and 4500 is a $500 difference and saying what you did is ignorant. Almost 5k down to almost 4K in a few weeks is massive and worth learning why and how to read in the future 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:52:14
Wouldn't that be a bad thing? My understanding of that article is he is saying that BTC, the coin, is overvalued and compared it to silver 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:45
Still going down
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:30:57
Looks solid. Snapback price concerns me some ($25) but 
- the designs are cute
- good conversation starter
- Is good PR for bitcoin
- monetarily helps bitcoin
- **accepts bitcoin payment**
So the site as a whole gets my approval. Good work and good luck 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:01:12
Well as a **Regime** you can do neither, because that costs money. As a **government** that is invested in its people then yes  
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:46:22
I pulled fully out at 4300(bought at 3200) because I did not understand the market fully. I am having trouble reading why these types of massive dips are happening. Any insight is welcomed, as I am eager to get back into BTC. I know this sub is pretty bias towards BTC, and that's fine, but please try and be objective with replies. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:45
