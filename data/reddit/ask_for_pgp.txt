Awesome! I gave it a spin and will keep editing this post with bugs.
1) I installed it, created wallet and clicked seed export on my own... Only for the wallet to have a complete hiccup later on when it wanted me to do the backups
2) no notification when I funded with test net coins
3) it should give a message right away that channels can only be opened when there is funds in btc wallet

Wtf miners can be remotely deactivated?? That's a slippery slope 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:54:44
But this is about trading, not blockchain transactions. Robin hood can definitely charge zero fees if they want to. Many Asian exchanges did it before. They probably offset costs (which are super small at scale) differently - maybe even just from the marketing budget

no its not about market price . every sell is effectively market price once it goes through.
look up difference between a 'limit order' and a 'market order'
and yes same fess for either buying and selling.

what you probably picture is called p2p trading and it might be possible and at some point down the line  and maybe even become a popular method.
but right now, all the tradding happens offchain, on trading sites where several people have trading accounts and "play" an orderbook - which is basically a database of bids and asks.
the blockchain solves a lot of issues but is not the solution to everything. centralized software architecture usually has one big advantage: efficiancy and speed - exactly what you want when you try to get orders filled or pulled back as soon as possible.
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:40:53
please explain... this sounds like nonsense since
trading is usually offchain

check this: 
i am telling you, the us dollar index will keep going up for a while. the carry trade is a giant macro trend and so is the disparity between intrest levels between USA and the zero intrest countries (mainly EU and Japan).
hence capital will keep flowing into the US; pushing USD higher
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:31:41
did you sell already, or did you not sell already? if you already traded into government money ( eur ,dollar, british pounding), then you created a tax event. no need to do more planning other than seeking a fucking professional to take care of it. expect to pay about a quarter in taxes
IF you still have the bitcoin you could also seek a professional. there might be an option to stagger your tax liability, making sure you are using writeoffs / free tax brackets etc
you could also just move to a country that doesnt charge you tax on bitcoin or tax at all. eg germany, dubai...
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:31:25
Yes, this is called "dollar cost averaging" and really works for any long term position where timing the market doesnt work (or is not the point to begin with)
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:28:54
They match internally in the app, their net exposure they proxy trade on open market. Probably gdax.
So yes, a increased buy pressure on Robin hood will definitely be felt on the overall market 
@_date: 2016-11-03 13:24:19
Im a bigger fan of this, for all EU customers:
its a wallet, and after a videochat verification you can buy bitcoins for 1% fee!
they will direct debit your bank account on the next day.
this is perfect for convenient spending here and there, no need to go through exchanges, do a withdrawal. mess around with backups etc
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:53:28
no, the "harder to mine" only means that the mining process is more competitive among miners.
this means lower margins for miner, but does not affect supply as its always 12.5 (currently) bitcoin every 10 minutes
@_date: 2016-12-07 07:36:40
its the hard truth :( many VCs are pivoting / backing out of crypto projects because there is not enough progress. the day will come, right now the timing is not right.

@_date: 2016-12-07 10:57:11
yep but you do have to understand their approach. simply buying bitcoins with VC money is a really really hard sell to the investment community. a mixture of both would have been smart - build bitpay, bitcoin-fiat kind of bridge businesses and get some actuall btc exposure as well.
@_date: 2016-12-06 12:44:57

hahahaha. good one.
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:55:40
yes they have a secret advantatage: they only have to pay back 80 cents on the dollar for the invested capital - because it will come in bitcoin and can be moved everywhere in the world.
the whole "investing into mining" in china is OK because it swaps their local, captial flow restricted, currency to bitcoin. 
investing in miners is the real scheme to get money out of china, not the exchanges.

It's just that bitcoin core is the purist implementation of bitcoin and its wallet actually needs the whole blockchain on your computer to work - most other wallets handle your keys and addresses for you but check them against a remotely hosted blockchain so there is no need to sync

please enlighten me. what is bitcoin about?

no, the big banks lobbied to stiffle smaller banks. regulationgs are usually to hurt competition. the big banks can stomach compliance costs much more than smaller.

you can only do downpayments and pay principial of mortage with after tax money
so you need to artificially create taxable income in your business which you will then use for the downpayment.
i think id rather sell the coins on an exchange and declare capital gains. ought to be more tax efficient?

@_date: 2017-05-27 09:09:34
ironically cashing out over longer times would reduce exposure to fluctuations not increase them. but i get what you mean, timing the top and such.
if you are verified at coinbase, use gdax with the same login. its a real legit exchange and you can keep some USD on there to buy back in etc. careful about taxable events though! it has less fees and as far as i know barly any limits.

you are funny. my transaction is stuck 32h now.
a few hours? no problem, I seriously dont mind
but in the last 32 hours I:
- paid my coder with rebit
- had to pay EU servers with bitwala
- wanted to register a domain at namecheap
and NONE of it worked. and I am not using a retarded wallet, I am using electrum. it has never let me down before. bitcoin has let me down. 
you guys keep forgetting: the people that browse well maybe even reddit in general are more technological advanced. I do not get panic about an unconfirmed transaction. I run a business. I do not care about a stuck 20eur transaction. I will stay loyal to bitcoin because it is great great, you do not have to convince me.
However, the average DAU user is stressed about it and it makes a GIANT dent in his user experience. without onboarding new users, that have a good experience this is just another "startup" running out of fuel. it will break our back.
bitcon archived so much. finally the price is somewhat stable, and finally those comical crashes stopped making the news, but now bitcoin transactions are just not reliable. this needs to change, so we can get ahead of the curve again

well yes it is publicly funded but it does not mean this is an endorsment for bitcoin specifially. again, they just onboarded another company (in this case a company selling bitcoin vouchers) to their universall point of sales infrastructure. it might as well be movie tickets or cellphone credits.

@_date: 2017-07-15 15:51:00
haha those people will never buy. not when bitcoin is at 300, not when bitcoin is at 3000, not when its at 1000.
"investing", or in bitcoin's case "speculating" is hard. its never easy, its always a thin line between payoffs and losing capital. the vast majority of people can't do it and will not do it.
the only thing that will bring us to the moon are applications, real world use cases that people buy bitoin for. TO USE IT, not to enforce some self fullfilling prophecy of more expensive coins.
gambling is such a usecase, dark net markets is another one. the remittance sweetspot is another one. but we need about thirty more real world applications for bitcoin to be truly reach its potential.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:16:44
dont want to be dramatic, but I just disabled BTC (through bitpay) on my website. it is not reliable enough at the moment

Sorry, you are getting too excited.
This is as federal as Federal Express. 
It is also not "paying attention to Bitcoin", it is simply onboarding one more merchant on their Pointofsale machines - that happen to sell microsoft office licenenes, facebook cards as well as apple appstore vouchers and a bunch of other stuff. 
it being in switzerland makes you draw connections in the head that are simply not there

FYI in the states everybody gets fucked a lot harder than in other countries. The same drug is sold for higher price in USA than everywhere else. The cell service, cable, insurance plans are all significantly more expensive than the same thing in Europe. It's not that companies make no profit over here either - it's just that the US has significantly less consumer protection laws and the small guy gets shit on more. Why anybody would applaud cozing up to big money like that is beyond me

well. so how does it work then in a simple usecase:
person A has bitcoin on mainchain
person B accepts bitcoin for cup of coffee
person A wants to pay one cup of coffee
person B will pay a supplier later at end of month
please tell me what channels will be opened, what fees to expect, and how person B actually gets Bitcoin to pay his supplier

@_date: 2017-06-06 20:49:57
this doesnt work because i need to commit the above transation to mempool first - which is rejected because of double spend attempt

scammed / hacked: I copy pasted BTC address into electrum and confirmed the bitcoin transaction. the clipboard replaced my bitcoin intendet bitcoin address with a different one. few minutes later i discuss with friend if he already sees it in his wallet. he didnt. It sent to wrong address
i checked all browser windows, private messages, chat histories. i do not know this address that grabbed the 13 BTC.

dont fixate on a typo. i know its lightning like the lighting bolt.
also i am not trolling, you can see from my other posts that i actually have a website with revenue to invidual bitcoin addresses and it is getting less and less viable to accept bitcoin for 5 USD transactions. so what to do? how will lighting help?
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:03:48
What. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:37:01
does anybody know how i could reach out to mining pools etc?

not on windows. macOS! i wrote "i checked all browser windows" - as in browser tabs.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:39:38
so in the beginning every idiot will open channels everywhere. at some point people will see thats pointless or only working in specific usecases (like gambling or microtransaction spam with same site). so relativly soon only a few big LN will crystalize. hopefully the bigger wallets will simply open LN channels? and me as a wesite owner will accept electrumLNcoins; trezorLNcoins, bitcoindLNcoins, coinbaseLNcoins? then settle them once in a while to mainchain/transfer them to a different LN chain?

pooling money with friends for IOTA
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:10:12
actually.... not really.
with lighthing you have to open a channel with everybody you want to do sidechain transactions. 
so if you want to buy coffee at starbucks, you would open a channel with starbucks so you can pay them.
STARBUCKS would have a channel with every single customer. channels cannot be joined after the fact. only closed and reopened with new people which will again cost onchain transaction fee.
lighting is for very specific usecases but doesnt help at all if you want to accept bitcoins from individual people irregularly.
i am for activating SF and for development of lighting to continue, becuase it is awesome tech and still has some nice fringe usecases - but it will NOT HELP if you want to have bitcoin as a trustless p2p payment system
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:44:46


yes of course i also think that few dollars worth of transactions can be "less secure" and can be settled every once in a while. what i really dont understand though is how it helps small websites. they would HAVE to have some account with coinbaseLN, right? then settle through them? this is paypal all over though.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:58:22
good question. i think the way it works is that bitcoin ATM would open LN channel with you (you only need your address) in case you do multiple purchases so they can keep sending you btc cheaply within that channel.
once you want to pay somewhere else or join another channel you would need to settle that LN on the mainchain, open another channel. maybe it helps to include "coinbaseLN" in the original payment channel already and it can then crosssettle?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:05:47
yes, I already built one transaction that includes a input from the scam attack transaction; but mempool rejects it because of double spend attempt:
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:51:25
this was on mac....
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:21:39
i understand SF should happen now but I am also troubled on how exactly will it help the transactions.
i have a online website, accept payments by bitcoin. i hand out individual bitcoin addresses for payments between 5 and 50 USD.
i sweep them regulary but at my latest sweep i had to pay more than 200 USD in FEES !!! how will SW and lighting help me here?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:38:51
I know. The bitcoin protocol did exactly what it was supposed to do: block the double spend attempt on mempool level already. I am happy bitcoin works well. I am crushed to lose this much money :(
