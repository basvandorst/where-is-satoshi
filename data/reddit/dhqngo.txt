Hey I am the author of this article and I can assure you of the legitimacy of the informations. 
Confidential documents were sent to me, and upon request from my source, I cannot let any of them go public. Please understand my concern. 
It took me a whole week to build this paper, and I too, had to check the authenticity of the informations. 
And come on... You've got to have a LOT of free time to imagine and create a fake article THAT detailed :)
Cheers!

I'd say because there are more people wanting to buy in and fewer people wanting to sell out. As most of them are holding, it gets much harder for the others to buy in, so these people are putting higher and higher bids which causes a relatively high price rise. I'm not a 100% sure though, but it seems to be the most logical explanation.

Are you talking about the Philippines or Indonesia?

Yes, [CoinDesk]( covered the story in May :)

Upvoting in support of ihb, which I really enjoy reading; and because BTCGAW does look fishy...

Thailand's got a few btc exchanges. 
There is  as well as  if I recall correctly. 
EDIT: Best solution would be to send some btc to a thai btc account, link a bank account to that btc account, and then cash out in baht.

I know these guys do: [ 
They can create your 3D modeling file (STL) from a drawing or an object.

We are getting so far away from what BTC was supposed to be : decentralized and (sort of) anon. Even though it was predictable, it's a shame.

Hahaha! Can you make me one with mine? XD

Sounds like a scam... Otherwise, you can always post your project on [Kickstarter](

What is your translation issue? 
Si les devises s'accordent au pluriel? J'ai envie de dire oui :)

All big exchanges require this kind of verification... If you're uncomfortable with it, localbitcoins.com is the only alternative I can think of. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 02:46:31
Where do you get these kind of infos ? 
Do you know if there is any forum or a IRC channel for Bitstamp users ? 
Thanks !

It makes me think of April's "bubble". At the time, almost everyone thought it was the end of Bitcoin. 
Looking at the charts right now, April's bubble was just a small, ridiculous pump. Prices have gone crazy during the past 2 weeks. Obviously there has to be a drastic correction. 
Waiting for the drop to buy more :)

Can you tell us more about your project ? Or is it still a secret ? :)

Pour traduire "Send some bitcoins" je dirais tout simplement "Envoyer des bitcoins". 
Phonétiquement, c'est beaucoup plus esthétique et naturel que "Envoyer quelques bitcoins". 
Après, c'est mon avis :)

It is legitimate. Only problem: fees are insane (10%)
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:47:39
Not sure if there is something like that yet but what about setting up a crypto-currency Think Tank? 
@_date: 2013-10-16 11:57:39
"Envoyez des bitcoins à quelqu'un!" Définitivement :)
Et si tu veux être encore plus proche de la version anglaise, ça serait "Il semblerait que vous n'ayez pas encore effectué de transaction..." etc
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:26:10
Interesting ! Are you by yourself in this project ? You should get partners.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:49:27
I'm pretty sure it is just a correction :) Might last 3-4 days until it goes back up again. Be patient and don't panic sell! 
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:43:15
Merci! :) 
Si tu as d'autres interrogations, n'hésite pas! J'écrie et blog à mes heures perdues ;)

My assumption is that the market is mostly owned by big investors. Most of them are early-adopters, startup geeks who invested in the currency in its early stage (when it was worth less than a penny) or drug dealers in the deep web. These are the guys that sell 100 BTC in a snap and make prices fluctuate like crazy. 
Even thought BTC is becoming popular and mainstream, the market is still oligopolistic. 
Of course, volatility is scary. But if you look at a long term perspective, BTC has got much more potential than 180 USD... 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:48:10
That's what I'm excepting to, somewhere between 190 and 250 (Stamps)

Opened my account last week, took couple days to get verified. Really like how their emails are signed and encrypted. As well as the different "layers" and options concerning 2FA. Dashboard looks great. Lots of advanced trading options: not just the usual "buy/sell order". Also, different assests available and SEPA is definitely a plus for me! Really happy so far :)
