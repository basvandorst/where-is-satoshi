Very good points.
I can tell you I have personal experience with being asked for source of funds documentation while not making any fiat deposit in a long time, right after a deposit transaction into the exchange.
Each exchange has their own policy about accepting mixed coins and how far they will go. It is part of their (private) AML policy.
Same here brother, I hate to live in such a world. But while tracking source of coins is possible, we will have to live in that reality and be careful about which coins we deposit into an analysed exchange.
If every bitcoin was mixed (like XMR is), you would not have this problem. But there will always be freshly mined btc, untainted btc and tainted btc, as long as mixing coins is opt-in and source of funds is public.

In that case you will own tainted outputs, dnale0r is pointing out that you may never own a tainted output in monero, if you choose to and are paranoid to that point.

i can't wait to get my coins tainted. /s
there are only two kinds of people who would use wasabi:
* idiots who don't mind tainting their coins and effectively devaluing them from not being accepted in analysed services
* criminals who are valuing their coins by getting mixed with untainted ones
i don't understand how something like this gets stickied, suckering people who don't know better into getting tainted coins.
Until coinjoins are done at the protocol level there is no interesting fungibility by using CJs

and risk getting change to your wallet in tainted coins.
