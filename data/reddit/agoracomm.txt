There is always us stateside - Veldt Gold! :) 
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:09:51
Veldt Gold here. We're pretty legit. 5 years in business and no issues with paying out in crypto in a timely manner. We buy and sell gold, silver, platinum, and palladium for Bitcoin, BCH, LTC, ETH, and now Monero. Many thanks!

Thanks realmoneyluvr!
This is Joseph and I am honored to read your commending post. 
With regards to more products, we have a new site launching in the beginning of 2015. The new site will be much more robust and we will be able to offer more products including the kookaburra.
Lastly we will adjust the 10oz bars. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

To thank you everyone for your incredible support, we decide to give you Bitcoin Black Friday Sale! ONLY on Friday! 
2015 Chinese Panda is HERE as well. Don't miss the chance!
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:37:58
Would you mind contacting us? We would not have charged you IL state tax since we are not required to collect it.
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:43:44
We tried to use robocoin while in vegas recently. After 20 minutes we still weren't allowed to withdraw fiat for our bitcoin.
Not a very good system if you ask us. 
Sorry about your loss 
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:47:52
Thank you for your support.
Due to Thanksgiving, the office will be closed on Wed. and come back on Dec. 1. 
All orders will not be shipped until Monday. 
Sorry for causing any inconvenience. :D

Congratulations Digital Tangible!!!
Linking precious metals to the blockchain is a wonderful advancement in the trading of Bullion

Thank you Digital Tangible. Good luck in building the first precious metals trading platform for the coming crypto age
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:55:56
You can buy from us but shipping is going to be costly. 
Check out  you can buy from them. Your metal is held in a depository and independently verified by a third party. You will be issued a token verified on the blockchain that your bullion is stored with them. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:12:05
Glad to hear you were able to figure it all out
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:00:04
Something like the Annoying Orange on YouTube.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:39:09
We're an online bullion dealer and we buy and sell precious metals for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:35:25
Thank you for your input! We don't accept credit cards because of a philosophical reason that bullion and credit should not be mixed with each other. We are the most competitive with Bitcoin prices, and have been for a very long while. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:42:05
I'm voting for BitPay as well. I've used both, but BitPay is outstanding.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:58:28
Thank you for your business.
We are happy to have you sharing your purchasing experience here.
If you have questions in the future, we will be more than happy to serve you.

Who determines what frequency is high frequency?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:11:11
You could just buy a bus when BTC goes back up.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:47:29
Good points there. I won't be reading it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:52:17
Agora Commodities here. We also ship faster than them on most occasions. :) 
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:44:08
And silver, and platinum, and palladium. Even some Rhodium. :)
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:12:27
We'll refund the difference :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:26:55
I'd say the fees aren't a problem specific to Argentina. If you're running a Bitcoin accepting online store with products which, due to the nature of what you're selling have to be sold at a 1% or lower premium, then choosing to accept cards puts you in a bit of a pickle. You either have to raise your premiums and end up pricing yourself way too high to get any business, or have two prices listed on the website - one for Bitcoin and one for card purchases, which would definitely piss people off. The alternative is not accepting cards at all. It kills off a lot of business, but if everyone did it I bet card companies would reconsider their often extortionate fees.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:46:49
Thanks for your input! We were going for the ancient Greek meaning of Agora when we named the company two+ years ago, and back then the biggest DarkNet marketplace was not synonymous with our name. We'll be changing our name when the new website launches, so this will not be a problem anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:29:42
Welcome and congratulations!
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:25:53
Thanks for the tip! We'll have to contact them and see if we can work something out.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:41:18
Why don't you start your own website where you can sell stuff for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:31:15
I'm not sure how you would "lend credibility or integrity to the technology" of Bitcoin in an image that small. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:27:56
A woman that can have a conversation and has an opinion? Yes, TERRIBLE date! &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:10:49
Woot! Thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:54:00
Agora Commodities here. You'll like us better when we rebrand and launch a new website, which should happen within the next month or so. You could still give us a try in the meantime. :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:26:48


You deserve a cookie for this.
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:58:27
Thanks for your feedback. We had issues in the past with customers sending us packages without letting us know first. The corporate address has now been added to the front page.
@_date: 2019-11-15 00:50:07
Thanks, that's much easier
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:46:19
We sell a variety of silver and gold products and we take Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:35:05
Thank you for your business, We're happy you're pleased with the transaction on [Veldt Gold]( 
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:41:43
We added Germany to our list of countries we ship to. Thanks for pointing this out! 
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:29:33
We aim to please! Thank you for your business! 
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:02:40
We have always had the Bitcoin checkout option. Perhaps you're talking about someone else.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:04:50
Thank you for your patience! We're doing what we can to clear the backlog.
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:29:40
It's nice to have such understanding and nice competitors! 
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:09:14
Should be fixed now. Please let us know if you still see the warning.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:03:45
We ship within 1-2 business days, and on Saturdays. ;) This is the first time our suppliers had long delays, and once they are resolved, we will be back to doing just that - shipping FAST and for FREE. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:01:50
Unfortunately we can't. Someone decided they had more rights to the word "Agora" than we did. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 21:51:07
Us! As in Veldt Gold formerly known as Agora Commodities. We happily take Bitcoin, and ship all orders for free in the US. Give us a try! :)
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:00:48
Thanks for the heads up! We will look into this ASAP.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:20:23
Thank you for the mention, and yes we do ship very very fast! 
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:56:11
We'll contact our suppliers and get back to you ASAP.
@_date: 2015-03-26 00:21:56
Yes you can definitely use our service! In fact, we offer express shipping to Australia (5-7 working days delivery) for a $45 flat shipping fee for packages up to 9 oz., and $80 flat fee for orders 10-18 oz. You can, of course, pay with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:11:47
Congratulations and welcome to the community!
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:52:28
It's interesting that a lot of people associate the term "Agora" with the dark markets. It would be curious to see how the 'owners' of the word Agora would react to that.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:56:29
We've now rebranded into Veldt Gold! 
New name, new products, still the same excellent customer service! We buy and sell gold and silver for Bitcoin! We also trade platinum and palladium. 
Visit our new website on 
Thank you for your continued support!
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:48:42
We changed our name because we were using the word Agora, which is 3,000 years old, yet somebody else thought they had more of a right to it than we did. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:25:19
We apologize if our website was coming up with security errors for anyone. We have just installed a brand new EV SSL certificate and there should be no issues from now on when you access  
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:20:18
Agora Commodities (us! :)) has now rebranded and is officially known as Veldt Gold. The old link to our website will automatically redirect you to our new website. We've added a bunch of new products, improved our international shipping costs (decreased them by a LOT!) and are continuing in out efforts to make improvement to the site.
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:33:48
Thanks so much! We don't have anything at the moment. Our employees like us too much to leave! :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:33:05
What countries' coins would you be interested in?
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:11:20
We enjoyed being part of this webinar! Thanks for sharing the link!
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:26:21
We are sold out and the wait list is now open. We are impressed by the demand from the reddit community
Happy Trading! 
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:09:38
We'd be happy to improve the guide with the help of the Reddit Bitcoin community! The point of the guide is to explain what Bitcoin is without complicating it too much for the novice user, since we still get occasional phone calls about from people asking us how to get Bitcoin, and how to use it on our website. The fact that we don't want to complicate it too much is also the reason why Bitcoin mining information isn't available through our guide. It is probably the purest form of getting Bitcoin, but the typical Bitcoin newbie may get overwhelmed by the idea of mining. We will, of course, be adding information about mining at a future date.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:44:57
Ha! We would love for Bitcoin to get a better price, too! 
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:44:23
Well said. And thank you!
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:52:51
Move your coins ASAP! And I will concur with some replies here, use Electrum or Trezor.

Any links to floorplans or pictures? Map?
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:53:07
Well no need to click on it.

Really!? No, wait for the FAFSA to come out and say you have to declare it
