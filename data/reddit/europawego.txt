Good point and it seems they've been trying to outpace the Mint as of late.

My example wasn't in regards to how the two men are being classified. My example was to bring reference to such sayings like "Never judge a book by it's cover.". 
 For the two RobinHood creators, you might be right about their character. However, continuous assumptions about one's character causes us to eventually justify our jaded ways and then it furthers the desire to allow ourselves to judge others based purely on those assumptions and nothing else. 
 You could meet 1001 hipsters that are all the same, but we cannot always assume that the 1001th hipster is the same as all the others.
 
 Profiling based on physical appearance is a recipe for overlooking something that could be worthwhile. 
Just food for thought.

Looks like the price will be around $18.00 after the split. Definitely seems like a somewhat decent price considering the premium. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:32:28
I truly believe you’re correct. Though I wish it weren’t true. I doubt the banks and media are going to  back off anytime soon

Wait.... so this is the FPP fee that I kept hearing about. You know, the Fuck Poor People fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:55:04
Very interesting... I wonder how well it will experience the desired effect and greatly increase in price. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:21:19
I figured this would be the case. The support levels between $9k-$10500 is pretty strong and further shorting would be more costly than to go long and drive the price up. 
Constantly shorting or stagnating the price will push away new investors and therefore reducing the amount of money that hedge funds will make. So it makes sense to swing the price around. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:48:52
Feels great waking up to a broken sell wall.

If Russia won’t ban it. Then we sure as heck know Trump won’t allow it to be banned. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:34:41
 I feel like the storm is going to get a lot worse before we see sunlight again. The media and banks seem to have a vendetta against crypto’s. It could be a month or six months before this trend reverses.  The second The media and banks stop spreading FUD. Is the day that we should all start investing as much as we can.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:34:47
They've already banned bitcoin....last year. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:38:27
It would make me an extremely happy person if that came to be. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:02:06
There's too many bots shorting in large bulk for us to ignore that the price is being manipulated. 
 Now whether the price is being manipulated for purely in connection to the futures. I cannot say, but there are those who are shorting for a profit and they could honestly be using this situation to scare investors away. Allowing the shorts to profit even more so. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:11:38
I don’t want to say it, but tether is actually an issue and could be a much bigger one down the line if not reigned in here soon.

Good Point
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:13:50
You are absolutely correct as banks will never cease to exist. For when it comes to the idea that not all banks will exist once cryptos start to really take a true foothold in our daily lives(beyond investing and checking the price constantly). Then you are right as I also believe that some of the banks who refuse to innovate and accept cryptos. Will fall behind. 
 It’s going to be very telling in the next 2-3 years. As the lightning network will probably be finished and implemented throughout most exchanges possibly this year. If it is as beneficial as it seems to be as of now in testing. Bitcoins presence will take off more so than ever before in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:46:28
Let's sure hope not. Such as a sharp dip in a single day would be devastating. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:33:13
Sadly there are many news sites that have an agenda and will not report such news and will spread further FUD to get the price lower. 
 However, I'm very glad that the South Korean Government has decided to step up and accept cryptocurrencies as something inevitable and work with it instead of against it. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:32:03
I hope most of those 200k investors will be fresh investors and not one's already invested.  As it'll be nice to have some fresh blood thrown into the ring and cause a stir under all the current BTC sellers. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:15:16
No, I don't think we'll see $19k for a little while. I'd say $15k would be a good price to get up to for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:36:29
I doubt we'll see much more of a drop.... at least not below $9k. However, unless we get some decent momentum upwards within the next two weeks. I fear we'll be staying somewhat stagnant for a while. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:14:42
I doubt it'll hit $100k in 2018, but I'll take $30k. I'm not greedy. :)

My dad who’s 75 isn’t into pot, but he’s definitely into crytocurrencies. 
 After trading in the stock market for over 40 years. He’s moved a little of his assets over into crypto and he’s enjoying the hell out of it. Hopefully all of the elderly can join us. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:54:41
I don't invest in just BTC, but some altcoins as well.
 My logic is that cryptocurrencies are in a way.... still within their infancy. With a few cryptos having very promising futures. I could see the potential of mass growth and with cryptos being a hot commodity that's growing on a global scale. I figured that the chance to make some decent money is something that I couldn't pass up. 
 The technology and benefits that cryptocurrencies have is one thing that I believe in, but the explosive upside for well developed cryptos that are new is the main reason as to why I decided to invest. Some may say I'm in it for a quick buck, but there are some cryptos that I saw as a short term prospect like TRX and some that I see as a long term prospect such as TNB.

I have looked up why and think that the South Korean politicians though they are flawed.

There’s plenty corruption within the US that has gone unchecked, blindly ignored due to fear of being outcastes or a lacking of ethics.

I'm usually a patient individual, but this BS back and forth with the price is getting old real quick. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:02:30
Thanks for the breakdown. Wonderfully done!
What's your thoughts on them taking the February futures and swinging the price in an upward direction?
 I feel as if there was a huge benefit shorting BTC in January(not just for futures), but the support level is too great around $10k now. However, the resistance level going upward could easily be broken and easy money could be made as regular investors are pushing for a run up as it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:51:52
Hopefully in an upward trend here soon 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:59:36
All media around the globe seems to be in agreement that any negative news in regards to Cryptos. Should be spun into a web of lies and panic. 
 Thanks for the information about the issues with exchanges. I think some regulations in regards to removing premiums and making sure that exchanges are working inside legal limits. Is something that is becoming greatly needed. A total outright ban isn't the answer, but some government oversight to make sure that the exchanges are following the law and paying their taxes. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:26:10
That would actually be a fantastic way for them to move forward. A good UI speaks volumes about how much an exchange or a company in general can grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:04:51
My thoughts exactly. I’d like to see movement in the upward direction, but $12k is holding strong.... evil sellers. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:04:38
Definitely looks like February might bring us back to some where we should be. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:49:42
You got it. let me buy some more first. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:44:33
It’s not going to crash. It’s looking to actually be pretty bullish here soon.

@_date: 2018-01-29 02:09:12
It’s a joke based on how Russia interfered with the US elections and Trump always speaks highly of Russia and Putin. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:21:38
Very true, I'm just surprised that there's so many people selling and pushing the price down right now. It seems like a good time to let it run up and not down, but who knows who's in control here. lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:04:30
We’re around $11,200 now. I’m very sick of this back and forth bs. The price needs to find a direction and stick with it. Up or down, choose one. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:57:30
Definitely a somewhat intimidating sell wall. I’m hopeful that we can get past it. Looks like it’ll take some chipping away at it first before it dissipates.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:54:16
You know how many physical things governments around the world have tried to ban and failed to end up doing so? Well Bitcoin is virtual and so good luck with that. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:11:30
You’re absolutely right. I should use the term FRAN instead. Thanks!
Also, it’s just incredible how much the media is attacking bitcoin and cryptos in general these days. I feel as if it’s a full on war against cryptos, but no one in the crypto community really did much to provoke them. It’s as if the media is on a crusade to kill cryptos for some intent that can only be theorized and not proven as of now. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:59:08
Same. I was lucky enough to accumulate a ton around $9500.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:04:55
Definitely telling about how China could fall behind and they notice it too. 
 They may not like how their citizens are trying to transfer money to international banks, but they may be left behind in regards to advancing technologies that may end up being more damaging if they don't allow cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:23:26
My feelings exactly. It’s getting to the point of being ridiculous. There’s so many sellers and I don’t see as to why. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:51:01
Most definitely.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:59:17
I believe you are correct. Big Banks and Governments are fearful of it, but cryptocurrencies work and it makes sense as to why they work better than the systems we have now. 
 You either be innovative and stay ahead of the times or stay static and fade away. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:26:54
This could lead to a nice increase to the price. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:38:14
That would be a depressing day. $10k is bad enough. $6k would be devastating for many. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:40:18
In my mind, a shutdown makes bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general a lot more attractive. Bitcoin is about getting away from the government and the shutdown could push people already looking at getting into cryptos. Cause them to invest. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:51:07
Damn right! I love Coinbase UI, but dislike everything else about it. We need exchanged that are innovative inside and out.

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:14:20
And to think that people still say that Wall Street wants nothing to do with bitcoin and that the media isn’t trying to push the price lower with all their Wall Street “analyst” FUD.... 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:41:50
I do believe you are correct. A government shutdown would further prove that cryptocurrencies are a good thing and make the investment seem much more attractive. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:23:08
Well to be honest. I think a government shutdown could definitely help the price of bitcoin. By home much, I don’t know, but it definitely could help. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:38:39
Are outside exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Bitfinex easily accessible in Singapore? 
...I'm legitimately curious. I'm not familiar with any legal or network  difficulties within Singapore to reach outside exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:46:44
I refuse to talk about cryptocurrencies with non-cryptocurrency investors at work.
Just do what we do and huddle together outside. Talking about your passions about blockchain technology and how much you all hate FUD. Then when non-cryptocurrency investors come by. You just start increasing your technical speak and they'll think you're crazy as they believe you're talking in tongues. 
 If there are no other cryptocurrency enthusiasts at work. Then keep your head down until the day you can drive your new lambo to work. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:58:41
I’m watching a good number of bots drop the price hard.... like really hard. Guess manipulations in alignment with the futures is turning out to be true. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:07:39
Yep.... pretty much. Maybe someday we'll see another run up.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:27:06
 I've talked on and off to family and friends about cryptocurrencies for the past 3 years and before this past month. Almost no one had any interest in talking about them with me.
Now all of a sudden the cryptocurrency boom has happened and people want to know everything about it. I went from telling people to check it out Holiday season. To tons of family and friends asking how they can buy different cryptocurrencies. So many people don't get it and just need to put in the time to read upon on the topic. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:04:59
Oh awesome. Glad there's an easily accessed exchange then. There's no fiat deposit limit like with coinbase is there?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:44:08
This is a great point. I was lucky enough to buy more at $9500 during the last dip. I'm just wondering and sorry if this sounds like a conspiracy. If the banks are helping spreading the FUD. So they can get in cheaper. 
 Banks over the last 3-4 months have shown more and more interest in cryptos and with the media treating cryptos worse than they would Trump. It just seems that it's going beyond just viewership for the media and that they might have an agenda. Again, apologize for the tin foiled hat kind of thinking. The whole South Korean corruption issue with them spreading FUD to make a quick buck makes me ponder that there are more like them with a much more controlled agenda. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:34:15
Dang.... they’re still doing it. I just counted 75 times in 2 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:53:12
I’m very glad to see it. Was great waking up and seeing it at $12,500. As there’s nothing better than seeing weak hands missing out. Now time to HODL. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:35:46
The FUD is so well organized as well... it's suspicious it feels like. I mean I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I just feel as if it's one thing after the next. 
 We receive a little bit of good news and then more FUD and then a little bit of good news and then more FUD. It's like the media finds some way of tripling the FUD for every piece of positive news. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:06:18

@_date: 2018-01-23 14:52:21
They should look at coinbases UI and do something of the sort and only the UI. Nothing else that Coinbase has done needs to come over. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:25:09
Oh it most definitely will. I just hope anything that's better greatly surpasses Coinbase within the future sooner than later. They've caused so many hiccups that's turned away a lot of potential investors. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:52:56
I attempted to believe in the beginning of this year that the media wasn’t out to get bitcoin and that they were just in it due to clicks. Negavitity sells right?
However, after the South Korean government officials were spreading FUD for profit. It started to convince me more and more. That big banks, governments and media are all in on it. I’m not talking about one big conspiracy, but each of them wants a piece. Governments want tax money and banks want to get in cheap. Why did Goldman Sachs start setting up a bunch of crypto trading desks and then people expect them not to invest in crypto? No way they’re going to pass up on it. In my mind, the crypto market as a whole is easily susceptible to FUD or just lies in general. Causing people to freak out when the media sources say that bitcoin is being blocked by all banks. Which we find out later isn’t the truth at all. 
 Sure the media has been known to exeggaerate. That’s part of their job. However, when trump is beginning to be treated a heck of a lot better than bitcoin and the hate trump inherits from the media is actually warranted. Then it no longer becomes about clickbait articles, but an agenda in my mind.
Large institutions can use the media to sway the public opinion and create fear for investors in bitcoin. I’ve even seen veteran bitcoin investors become scared. Which at that point, you know the big boys are getting in and loading up.
 Maybe I have my tin foil hat on too tight, but as someone who’s traded stocks for around two decades now. Nothing surprises me anymore for when it comes to the power and control big banks have.  If someone can make millions of dollars off something. You can bet your ass that Wall Street will figure it out as well and perfect it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:01:48
This is great news! An out right ban would have been way more damaging than enforcing taxation and banning anonymity. Hopefully the world see's this as much as a massive win and also that crypto exchanges can be regulated fairly without going overboard by banning. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:32:52
They can try to forge all they want, but if there's any suspicion. It's possible to reach out to the exchanges to verify the transactions. The IRS did this last year with Coinbase and this year. Coinbase will be releasing all and any necessary paper the IRS is needing beforehand. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:15:30
No, I don't think we'll see $19k for a little while. I'd say $15k would be a good price to get up to for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:10:27
They sell in mass too. It isn’t just a few bitcoins here and there. I watched 40-50 bitcoins being dumped all at once about 8 times a day. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:48:53
Wall Street is only subtle about something for when that something is illegal. Otherwise they will do whatever it takes to control the situation and profit from it. I've seen it through all my years of trading stocks and it has cease to surprise me. 
 I theorized that the futures, media and shorting would probably drop the price of Bitcoin astronomically back when Bitcoin futures were first announced. We saw first hand through the South Korean government. That politicians use FUD to get the price lower and politicians have a decent amount of restrictions. Imagine how much power Wall Street has as their resources and restrictions are dealt with by having billions in capital and paying to have those restrictions uplifted. 
  The thing to remember is that shorting is only good for so long. You cannot have a streak of shorting without any upsides and expect to maximize your profits. In order to truly profit from shorting anything. You need to short at the right times and then raise the price at the right times. Playing both sides will increase your ROI. So my guess is that those with the capital that are shorting now. Will more than likely push Bitcoins price much higher once the support levels are too dangerous to play with and getting through the resistance levels would be much easier. Allowing them to play the next set of futures with a bullish play. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:31:55
It's definitely looking positive.
I've believe the the shorts are having a difficult time pushing down below $10k. Reducing their profits are shorting towards a support level of that magnitude can be expensive and can backfire.
 No on the flip side. Turning around and going bullish can spark the investment from others that they're needing. Which makes sense as shorting Bitcoin can be more difficult than pushing the price up. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:57:39
This! Credit unions are non-profits and most of the time. They are much more about their customers than paying their top execs massive bonuses. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:35:05
$7000 could in my opinion be a breaking point for most investors. At that price, it would probably take quite some time before the price ever fully recovered. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:39:09
I feel as if the US should be examining South Korean politics a little more for a chance of bettering themselves
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:56:20
Ah, thanks for clarifying what's going on. It seems there's stuff going on in the background that my friend wasn't aware of.
 Seems like though the automatic withdrawals and deposits are something of a hindrance. That things could be resolved here shortly.
 It's humorous that the media tries to spin such issues into a full blown panic that the banks are stopping any and all transactions with exchanges.

I've been trading stocks through the NYSE for almost two decades now and usually make anywhere between 10%-20% ROI every year. 
 Within my first two months of trading cryptocurrencies. I made around 500% ROI. Which would have taken me 25 years to do on the stock market if I made 20% every year.

Seems to be like it. Definitely emphasizes the term HODL more and more.

I'd say HODL for at least a month or two. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:01:36
I doubt it'll be like this every time. If the big boys who are shorting to profit from the futures do here with Bitcoin as they do with most stocks. Then we'll see a major swing in the next 1-2 months.
 Hedge funds or those with the capital to control the price to a decent degree. Will play the ups and downs. Pushing the price lower for 2-3 future expirations and then raise it up. They do this as support and resistant often times can scare them. So with Bitcoins support levels being so strong between 8k-11k and has been increasing. This will push their hands to move in the opposite direction and push the price up. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:30:23

I completely agree. The stock market is sometimes a good fallback to understanding how crypto investments work. Not 100% the same, but enough to apply your stock trading knowledge here.
 As for the end of the year, you're absolutely spot on. If you look at Bitcoins previous history and the stock market in general. As you said, this is a normal trait. People sell off at the end of the year and then the 2nd or so week of January is lift off time. Not saying we'll see 20k+, but we'll see a decent pump up if history repeats itself.

It does suck to see our investment value dwindle but bitcoin has a long way to go in my opinion. 
I truly do believe we’ll see $10k+ again someday. However, what I care most about is seeing bitcoin be used in a mainstream fashion. Sure it’s nice to see new exchanges pop up and exchanges trying to prevent further hacks but the real kicker is getting bitcoin to be used for daily transactions throughout the world beyond exchanges.

It goes well beyond taxes. The American dream is to drive a fancy car, have beautiful women surrounding you 24/7, live in a giant mansion and never have to worry about money ever again. 
 However that dream is so rarely ever able to be had and most people who live like that are unhappy. Sadly, the American dream is whats embedded in most childrens minds within the US at a young age and has proven to only further demonize the way of life that many Americans live. 
 America has more working hours than most other nations, the cost of living has gotten insane, most American citizens are overwhelmed by materialism and there's the constant impression that being number 1 means that no matter what the government or anyone else does. It's just a matter of time before people stop carrying and it becomes accepted.

There’s an altcoin called TimeNewBank(TNB) that has partnered with a company for international use and is currently being used right now. 
 You are right however, that most investors invest into altcoin due to speculation with a short term goal. 
My main issue with most altcoins. Is that there’s so many useless ones among them. There are a so few that are currently being used within any application. That it’s dirtying the waters for the few that are truly useful.

I know a lot of people are making sarcastic jokes here, but a lot of people are truly hurting inside. I've got friends who bought into the hype and put way too much money in. It's sure easy to judge them, but people make mistakes and it sucks to watch people suffer so much.
I'm sorry your investment hasn't turned out like you thought it would. I truly believe we'll see a turn around as there's so much FUD going around. That when it ends and people see the light again. We'll have a few good up days, but who knows when that'll be.

Don’t remember the exact source, but a Wall Street analyst said about 2 weeks ago. That putting anywhere between 5-10% of your assets towards investmenting into cryptos especially bitcoin. Isn’t a bad idea.

It's pretty obvious all media sources have waged war against Bitcoin. It's gotten to the point that it isn't even about pushing out clickbait articles as I've seen some sites viewership for those types articles go down quite a bit. It's pure agenda in my mind, but who's agenda......
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:51:07
I'm pretty certain it'll recover within the next 1.5 years. It's just going to be upon the lightning network to truly get us there.
 The governments have scared people and banks are fighting the change, but change is inevitable. We just need to be patient.

I've lived in Texas most of my life and it's very true. The narrative that America is number 1 is ingrained in most Americans. I studied other cultures when I was young and learned quickly that that wasn't true at all. Then once I went overseas for the first time when I was young. It solidified the fact that America is number 1 for many things, but it isn't happiness or enjoying life without materialism being involved. 
 As for most Americans being fat. It definitely is hard to blame the younger generations. Since they grew up with parents who loved to feed them McDonalds 3-4 times a week. Not saying all American families went that route, but enough did that has further perpetuated the statistics of obesity within the US.

The Volatility isn’t a roller coaster that will likely last forever. The necessary technology to make bitcoin a key component for markets around the world. That is something that needs to happen ASAP and it is. Stabilizing the price will come in due time.

It’s crazy how so many on this subreddit have turned anti-bitcoin since it’s “crashed”, but when it was around $15k. They were all bitcoin pros who were looking for the moon. 
 People need to wake up and realize that just because the price has dropped so much this past month. That it doesn’t mean bitcoin is a worthless shitcoin or that other altcoins are better. The technology is still there and it’s constsntly improving. With more developers working on its improvements than any other coin. 
 I also find it interesting that the media and people look at bitcoin as if it’s the only investment to ever crash this much. I’ve seen multiple stocks in my day crash to obscene levels, but then bounced back twice as much. Not saying that’ll happen with bitcoin, but people need not to treat bitcoin like it’s some stand alone titanic disaster.

The coordinated attacks from multiple media sources has make me super curious and theorizing that something semi-big is going on. When the media attacks something more than Trump and that something has done nothing to hurt them. Then you know there's an agenda, because attacks on Trump generate the same amount of clicks.

It's had a nice bounce this morning. It's possible the bubble burst, the air was set free and we're finally unshackled with the ability to go back up.

No offense, but have you looked into what the lightning network does or even remotely tried to consider how it's going to revolutionize Bitcoin on a global scale? 
 I understand skeptics, but your comment is just plain ignorance.

I used that example to express the volatility of Bitcoin and it's abilities to go up and down with vast numbers.

People laugh and mock anyone who says bitcoin will go back up to $20k, but people mocked those who said it would go to $20k in the first place. 
 Bitcoin is a wild ride and it could drop down to $1 or go up to $50k. People who try to predict bitcoin will either be pleasantly surprised or horribly disappointed or satisfied.

I've been thinking this since the beginning of the medias WWIII attack on Bitcoin mid-January. 
After years of trading in the stock market. Hedge Funds and Big Banks are known to control certain aspects of media flow. People want to deny it, but a lot of wealthy individuals at banks. Also own parts of media companies as well. A lot of "journalist" sites don't make a lot of money and so the big boys buy them up, force their hand on certain topics and enjoy the tax write-off. It's a win-win.

One of the worst cases is when parents reward their children with McDonalds for good behavior. Which I've seen lead to families doing almost a daily trip to there.

The issue right now is high transaction fees, slow transfer rates and batching issue. All of which Lightning Network will resolve. 
Edit: It'll challenge credit card fee's and international pay pal fee's once completed and setup around the globe.

Tether could be a huge issue for BTC. However, I'm starting to see more and more evidence that Tether may not be as an issue as we all thought. As long as they can get an audit going here and resolved within the next 2-3 months. Everything should be fine.

Watch the news and how much FUD they spread without much or any factual backing. 
 The India media is a perfect example as of today. They were all spewing how the Indian government banned cryptocurrencies, but it was found to be a mistake. However.....the media never corrected their "mistake" and the same goes with Bloomsberg about the subpoena. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:09:19
I think we’re headed to around $10k. Which again is only a prediction but I believe it to be so due to the drop in sell volume from the current price to around $10.5k. 
Usually when the sell volume is above 3,000 BTC within a $2k difference above the current price. We see a stalling or a decent drop. However, when the sell volume drops below 2,000 BTC within that range. We usually see a bull run or a small steady increase. 
This of course is just my observation of the price over the last year or so and doesn’t mean it’s the best way to predict the price. Just a pattern I’ve noticed that’s more frequently correct. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:40:53

I'm thinking somewhere along the same lines. The sell off doesn't seem natural as I doubt the average investor has 5-10 BTC to constantly sell in blocks.
