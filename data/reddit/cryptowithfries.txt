Eh? I'm not on about that. u/prelsidente said of BleepingComputer, "a solid source", in a sarcastic manner, I'm assuming.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:07:40
Don't apologise for your English mate. It's very good ��

Have you checked Bittylicious? Nothing like Coinbase, more P2P. UK based.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:08:06
Ehhh I'd take the 5 bil. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:42:17
Do I detect sarcasm? BleepingComputer is a fairly well sized techie news site and forum. I just did a search on Alexa and it's current global rank is 6,422. I'd say that's quite a popular website.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:43:02
I'd be careful publishing your email address especially if it's associated with your Coinbase account.

What's with some US states not being available? Can anyone offer a decent explanation? Cheers.

Hey heyyyy congratulations! Bike safely ��
Perhaps you should have got an orange one though? ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:19:01
US (minus a few states), UK, Canada, might be a couple more countries. Unfortunately the rest of Europe isn't in yet.

Looks like Chase refused this guy a loan...

Now that's a good looking ATM! A huge improvement on some of those shitty, shady looking things you see around.

@_date: 2018-06-22 07:04:07
Certainly looks hideous.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:47:58
Well! I've never seen this before! ^^/s

Sheesh. Don't hold back or anything

Lmaooo love it

What's with the B with horizontal stroke through it? Looks shit. Why not use the proper Bitcoin logo?

The Chairman's name is Crapo. Excellent.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:08:56
Ah jeez.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:25:35
Really hoping this person dropped a /s somewhere.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:32:25
"It's fine."
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:20:27
Should that person's name be on that screenshot ? Or have i misunderstood?

I've never really watched infowars until this interview but I assume it's a non-crypto related outlet. Whenever I see Roger (actually most other experts) in crypto on outlets that are not crypto specialist, he talks with jargon that makes no sense to people outside the crypto world.
As someone who has to sell technology to technophobes for a living, i understand it's sometimes difficult not to use jargon when trying to communicate about it. It's very important to realise how you're approaching the conversation and make it easier for those who don't know the full ins and outs to understand on their level. Without sounding condescending.
That's my 2 sats. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:13:57
Why are you even bothered? Strange.
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:14:43
That is pretty sweet!

Well, it's red brick and says 'shoppe' , I can see how you made the mistake

Also in the UK and my accountant, while didn't laugh, is also old school and didn't quite get it at first.
Looking at how others around the world have to deal with their Crypto taxes, I feel pretty lucky to be in the UK considering we have a history of ridiculous taxation.
That said, not paying tax up to £11700 on CG, and not until it's converted to GBP... I'm not sure if that approach will last too long (looking at how the US are doing it, HMRC will one day realise, in their mind, that they could be fucking us harder).
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:05:48
Good luck getting a seat!

Totally. Looks dodgy af.

Ha the aunt thing made me laugh. The crow design is pretty nice mate ��

More solid information in this etch a sketch than most of the TA shite out there.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:20:08
I wish you all the best with your venture.
However, personally, there's no way I'd walk  around advertising that I own crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:02:41
Yeah that does sound like a good idea
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:21:56
Thank you. Glad someone else is on the ball.
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:42:28
Love seeing crypto ATMs but this particular one is an example of poor POS design. To have to stick two pieces of ink jet printed paper at the bottom telling us what this thing is backs up what I'm saying.
Needs huge ass BTC/LTC/ETH logos as part of its design, not stuck in the corner too close together.
Still, good to see an ATM. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:48:08
Lol thank you. Never did like sites with the .xyz TLD.
