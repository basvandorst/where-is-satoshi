its better to think of it more like a carnival.  
You pay admission  
you pay inflated prices for beverages and perhaps food you know you shouldnt eat  
you watch a few variety acts  
maybe pay too much for a rollercoaster ride or a spin on the ferris wheel, Dont forget to keep your hands in the car at all times.    
but if youre smart you dont fall for the midway games, No matter how much you spend you never really win   
you go home with an empty wallet, a smile on your face, and an unusual odor permeating your clothes.

I dont get it.    
thats like saying....    
Im looking to buy a dildo....but Im not interested in having orgasms.   
What is the interest in mining then? your electric bill too low now that youve switched to compact florescents and your looking for a way to get it back up?   
I own a small gold mine in california, Im about a month away from my yearly trip....you can send me gas money for my equipment if youd like. Ill send you some pics so you can see what real minings like. LOL
Sorry to bust your chops I just really dont understand the reasoning.

mortgage companies dont look at that sort of thing. They are mainly concerned with regular ins, and regular outs. Mostly just the regular INs though....since theyll just take your HOUSE if you dont OUT to them.

if you place a bar of gold under your floorboard and the price of gold plummets did you retain your original value?

why should they want to?  
Most stores dont accept bitcoin  
Most websites dont accept bitcoin  
You want bitcoin, youll probably pay more than spot  
You want to cash out your coin, youll probably get less than spot  
Bitcoin is a great idea, its got plenty of potential, but its pretty easy to understand the disinterest....and it sounds like your friends find your over enthusiasm annoying.

fiat currency 
vs  
representative currency  
By using a closed mining pool the value of the crypto unit can be regulated. Only allowing a unit into the economy once some tangible asset had been secured ov equivalent value.  
So in the case of a gold based crypto, there may be 10000 coins mined, but only 1000 coins worth of bullion in reserve. So the remaining coins are cold stored until the systems economy grows.  
I guess the direction of my thought is going something along the lines of worldbuilding, and creating economies using alternative currency systems. As I oppose fiat currency in real life, I see no reason not to consider what cryptocurrency has to offer a representative currency system

My example of walmart is a poor one.  
Instead lets say you create a POS terminal that includes a mining asic. And market it and your closed cryptocurrency to small businesses. So every new small business you place a POS system with is mining. Every location is acting as a currency exchange point.   
Do bitcoin ATMs mine?  
Really im just pondering the nature of private banking, cryptocurrencies, and future economic structures.  
@_date: 2015-09-20 23:10:27
Perhaps I misunderstand cryptocurrency entirely  
When I receive a handful of coins there is no telling their history.  
Wheresgeorge gives an interesting account of the path a dollar travels through serial number tracking  
In my mind, bitcoins are like trading serial numbers off of dollar bills instead of physical money. Where banks have licenses and oversight ensuring trust when they send debits and credits between themselves, the account ledger database system, person to person transactions lack that level of authentication so we must, to economically interact individually, engage an intermediary such as paypal, vendmo, googlepay, etc. which has their own system of authentication and trust we are bootstrapping our transaction to.  
So my understanding, which I admit maybe lost in my own imaginations inaccuracies, would be that cryptocurrency takes the trust factor and instead of placing it in the hands of a third party it instead relies upon the algorithm....in my mind checking the serial numbers of the imaginary bills as it reassigns them from your account to theirs.  
So while walmart giftcards can be used at walmart and verified by walmart, and walbux would provide little advantage to them....   
A network of independent businesses, collectively backing a closed cryptocurrency.....or a small town creating a localized cryptoeconomy....WOULD, seemingly benefit from the implementation

Every single case you have listed, with the possible exception of Shrem....and there was some shadiness going on at bitinstant...was directly tied to some other criminal activities. 
To answer your question though...if you sat in an airport and bought british pounds and japanese yen from tourists as they got off their planes you would be operating a currency exchange and would require licensing. When you trade forex you are not doing direct person to person transactions so money laundering is not of the same concern..and the platforms on which you are trading have licenses that cover your activities. They too are required to meet "know your customer" mandates.

Satoshi is never coming back....  
Satoshi lost faith in bitcoin shortly after he created it, thinking no one would ever get behind it. By the time bitcoin was blowing up...he had long since lost his wallet.dat  
Since everyone assumes Satoshi is sitting on a fortune....he figures no one will ever believe it was him.

just because the clerk you spoke with is uninformed is meaningless.   
Bitcoins do not fall under their regulation....but the act of brokering them does. Almost everything you need to know is right here   
There are specific financial requirements, I am unaware of amounts on, to ensure liquidity. But otherwise its a basic background check and fee operation. As long as youve no shady history, dot all i's and cross all your t's....you should be approved.

no buying a bitcoin for $0.75 is like paying $8 for an ounce of gold. Because your speculative dream of a trillion dollars is some DISTANT potential value.....  Golds value at that distance future will also be higher or lower.  
Buying a bitcoin at $300 is like buying stock in a startup....it may be the next apple...or it may be the next dotcom scandal.
