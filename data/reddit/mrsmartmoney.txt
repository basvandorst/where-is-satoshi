Bitcoin is not physical. Gold is physical. If you’re asking what can I do physically with bitcoin, thats like asking what can you do physically with anything natively Digital. You can’t interact with it physically.
But just because something isnt physical doesnt mean it has no intrinsic value.
Youre not understanding what I’m saying about the intrinsic value of Bitcoin.
I’m giving you the answer: the intrinsic VALUE of Bitcoin, is INHERENTLY it’s blockchain.
The same value, and market cap we ascribe to Visa, Mastercard, Banks, Payment processors, PayPal, etc - Bitcoin is the decentralized “Internet” version of those TRUSTED third parties.
Those companies are inherently valuable, even though they have no physical- because they verify transactions on their own internal ledger, and they charge 2-3% on every transaction they pass through. They are single point of failure systems, which can be hacked.
Think about it- if VISA were to get hacked every week- the companys market cap would be $0. no one would trust them. The verifying of transactions is inherently valuable.
Now thought experiment: imagine there was a company, which was essentially unhackable, and they took those transaction fees down from 2-3% to almost zero.
How much is that company worth?

From your wired article, VERBATIM:
“Another source of concern---that bitcoin is dicey because it lacks “intrinsic value”---is a weak argument. In truth, almost nothing in the world of trading and money has “intrinsic value.”
I’m beginning to think you are just trolling. If not- god bless u sir.

Your question is invalid because its a straw man. In the same way that ad hominem attacks are not logically sound arguments.
By your own logic, fine art has no “intrinsic value” outside of the paper its painted on. 
Dont dodge my question- Answer me this: 
do you think Blockchain, the technology is valuable, or worth anything. Yes or no.

What can you do with the numbers in your bank account?
You can currently use Bitcoin in the same way. To buy roughly $8,000 worth of goods.
I’m telling you, the same intrinsic value that companies like Paypal, Visa, have- because of payment verification, will soon be Bitcoin, and more.
If you’re talking about intrinsic value, vs market value- in financial terms. You can consider the cost of mining 1 bitcoin as it’s intrinsic value, and whatever the current market is paying for Bitcoin at it’s Market value.
But if you’re thinking of Bitcoin like a stock, like future free cash flow, you need to think about what will the future value of something that is &gt; Amex, paypal etc- what is that company or thing worth?

Keep referencing articles u dont even read. GJ bro.

Blockchains are only valuable in so far as they are trustable, unhackable, etc.
Bitcoin is by far the largest, and most trustable blockchain.
That trust is the intrinsic value. 
Fiat has value, bc we put trust into our government, that they will pay debts, not debase the currency, etc. That story is slowly dying.
Bitcoin will win, because it’s blockchain is the ultimate trust bearer. All the computer power behind it, etc.

LMAO. both articles you linked to dont even support your argument. u didnt even read them, or you cant even comprehend them. 
the first one says gold has no “intrinsic value” either.
the second one is a pro-bitcoiner whos trying to look at the other side of the argument. ��

The fact that youre conflating the word “intrinsic value” with “utility” is proof enough that you need to study more abt the subjects at hand. 
Your question is a straw man argument. Google it.
Of course the answer to your question is “nothing”.
Thats like me asking “What can Gold do other than be used for jewelry and small tech applications/store of value?”
Youve precluded the main use case for Bitcoin in your question.
It is the future of store of value/payments, and decentralized finance. That value alone is worth trillions.
Youve watched one too many Peter Schiff videos.
The fact that you said “bitcoins arent blockchain” and that you dont own a “share of the blockchain” is further proof that you dont understand the technology.

Thats where I hope you can see things more clearly. Fiat money only holds value, because you trust governments. 
The intrinsic value for money is in your trust. 
Bitcoin is tokenized trust- bc blockchain tech is revolutionary. And blockchains are only valuable in so far as how trustworthy they are.
Your view of “intrinsic value” is too simple and not nuanced.
Do you think fine art has zero intrinsic value? Pieces sell for millions of millions of dollars, but theyre just paint and canvas. Surely they cant be worth $20, or the value of its parts.

Your money’s intrinsic value is in guns, nuclear warheads, and the full power of the US Govt.
Money is the physical manifestation of trust between two parties.
Bitcoins intrinsic value is the tokenized trust of the blockchain. You are putting your trust into the currently most un-hackable piece of code ever written, and the strongest decentralized super computer in the world to verify transactions.
What is it that you’re not understanding?
Are you saying the blockchain has ZERO value for what it does??
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:56:04
meh. half yes n no.
gold has some utility, jewelry, etc
stocks have utility if they pay dividends (cash flow)
real estates utility is obvious.
out of the 4, fiat truly has no utility. esp if crap hits the fan

I think in today's time this may be seen as paradoxical, but I expect that when the last bitcoin is mined, there will be price stabilization.
It's hard to imagine time lines in even 20, 30 years - (think about how much the world has changed since 1980) but my gut says that by 2140 when the last bitcoin is mined, there will be wayyyy less volatility, and much more use of BTC as a currency.
It's crazy to think on a timeline of over 100 years, but I really imagine bitcoin going through huge rallies and crashes for the next century, and until then - being used more as a store of value.
We're so early into the price discovery phase of this thing, it's hard to tell.

Nice.
