Instead of mining BitCoin or other currencies on your own this software works by connecting your CPU / GPU to a mining pool. Following my guide all you need is Linux and Docker to start receiving shares - this can be run in the cloud or on your own hardware too. FAQ in the README.
You get paid for the shares your computer makes towards solving a block. The NiceHash mining pool used in this example lets you mine using two dozen different algorithms and can tell you what is most profitable for your hardware.

In what way? You're not mining Bitcoin, you're mining whatever is the most profitable and getting paid shares in Bitcoin to your wallet. You can earn earn several dollars / day with a reasonably powerful CPU. If you have cloud credits or use spot instances you can multiple that.

"In effect" you can run software in a Linux or Windows container. When running within a container you get a new filesystem i.e. a chroot and other security features. Docker for Windows uses Hyper-V virtual machines - Linux uses a shared Linux kernel.

In my example it means you can bring down the container image with all the dependencies for pooled mining built-in and then run it wherever you want without rebuilding any code or installing packages.

What's Docker?
