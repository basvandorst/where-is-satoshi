ebay could use a third party service for the integration. the problem is that the *end users* won't use bitcoin because the fees are unacceptable.

I am a time traveler and cannot confirm this. no double spend, no double price.

what if the buyer does not confirm intentionally? Ebay will have to expand its  fraud department substantially to handle transaction fraud, which is a lot of work (this is currently offloaded to credit card vendors). so probably not something they will do.

what would the bitcoin community do if a country forced its citizens (at gunpoint) to move their coins to something like its central bank?

Anyone of the US can confirm that the president alone can do that?

thanks. You know, it always astounded me how the US killed osama, gadaffi etc and nobody even discussed whether they could be captured and convicted  for their crimes against humanity, in the way that is appropriate for a civilized state. 
Also one might consider an alternative explanation, that the rise of authoritarians is due to a massive anti-establishment wave that has captured the west, and the authoritarians happen to be the ones who take advantage of it. Mark blyth has written and lectured about [Trumpism]( on that subject. [also this](

I can confirm this comment is correct.

That is massive amounts of capital that can help fund the local economy, how can you deny that it's a huge benefit for their economy?

Switzerland is actively shrinking its banking sector, especially after their latest moves to start sharing tax fraud information with other EU countries  and the US (many depositors are turning to more exotic economies, such as the UAE). That doesn't mean Switzerland has not massively profited in the past century from the secrecy of their banking system.
