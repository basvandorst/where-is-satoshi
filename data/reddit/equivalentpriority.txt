Can someone tell me what are the advantages of it including libsecp256k1 and the revealer plugin?
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:12:56
bitcoin can change the signature algorithms.  Not so easy for everything else the touches our daily lives hundreds of times a day.

Do you have any idea which will come first and when it comes will we still need to get miner approval like with Segwit?
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:46:17
Thanks very much for the list.  It's good to see some positive news these days. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:58:56
Hopefully you're joking or if not your just an alt coin pumper.

Sounds like just the kind of company people need to move away from.

How can they crackdown on something they already cracked down on a few times?

Lightning on the Mainnet has done a lot to putting an end to the FUD that's been going on for the last year about the price of transactions. There may be breaking changes but it's been the best thing to happen in years.

That's the usual technique.  A neutral article, perhaps praise bitcoin, then ... you know what comes next.

He's nothing more than a BCash troll.  Tired of hearing these guys babble on instead of making a useful contribution 
@_date: 2018-07-01 09:10:45
If you think that then why do you spend your time on this reddit?
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:21:41
WOW !
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:33:44
He has about as much interest in Lightning as we here have an interest in scam coins.  Should be pretty obvious to anyone.

His posts are being retweeted on Twitter by  so I think it's reasonable to assume this is the start of his attempt to run a smear campaign to try and damage the reputation of the Lightning Network.  Also pretty clear from his medium post that he's trying to discredit LN by making out that users all have to run their own LN nodes and explaining how this is a very difficult thing to do.  Pretty pathetic attempts to discredit LN by a bunch of losers.

1-3 cents maybe

What are the chances that the miners will hold this one up for years?
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:26:14
Waste of time and money.

As a redditor for 2 days (yes I know this account I use is just 2 months old but i have been in crypto for more than 3-4 years since the days when BTC was $230 and a rise of $1 was exciting) I've a feeling you're part of this game that he's playing.  We're not all so dumb here in the crypto space to believe the techniques the author is using in his medium post. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:33:08
Too weird.  Just think about it for a minute and then wait a few weeks till he tries to make a fool of us all with his games.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:46:30
Nice try Roger 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:47:10
100% right
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:34:52
Just two words for this guy:  pathetic loser
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:46:51
LOL
