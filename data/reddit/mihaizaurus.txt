It took a 25% drop when it hit 11.5k, dropping down to 8.5k... didn't last long though... with the current hype/fomo/increased adoption/whatever, unless there's massive bad news, yes, people will take profits, but I don't see a major reason for it to maintain a low for very long. It seems to be eating up minor drops really quickly at this level. But trying to predict what BTC will do is like trying to calculate the lottery numbers...

Some European countries tax wealth, not just capital gains, so just Hodling is not a safe hedge unless you're entirely hidden from the prying eyes of Big Brother. But then, if you plan on playing it legit, you need to be able to trace your ins and outs.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:00:07
Correct. When you transfer less than the total amount on an address, it will set the amount you send as "spent" and the change, if you will, as "unspent" to a new address generated by the wallet's seed. that basically means the "unspent" is like your available balance, what you can send without it being considered a double spend. If I understand it correctly, it's the unspent values that are taken into account when nodes check to make sure the transaction is legit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:30:03
Agreed, but it's a gold that cannot be confiscated and that can easily and rapidly be transferred to anyone, anywhere. Granted, we're in a period of congestion and rather high fees, but it's being worked on. It can do much more than gold can. It can be a safe store of value while also being divisible and transferable, without requiring custodial services for security.

That might be because the terrible democracies invest very little in education. An educated population is great for itself, maybe not so much for a government seeking to justify itself. Though this is not a problem with all democracies, nor is it a problem only for democracies.

A lot of unbacked assumptions go into your comment...


1. Yes a lot of the vocal people are on the train to try and make money off of the bitcoin (and mostly altcoin) market. A lot of people are also in it because they believe in the tech and see it as a financial revolution in terms of personal management on one's wealth. Its use as a digital gold is more prominent than its use as a form of cash. 
2. It's a poor assumption to say people are mostly doing it for nefarious reasons. Bitcoin is neither anonymous nor untraceable and most people using crypto for such reasons have moved on to alternatives like Monero or Zcash. There is also a good number of legit businesses that accept it as payment. There's a sub for &gt; not in it's current form, with transactions that take hours, even days or weeks to complete.
Another beauty of the Bitcoin system is that it allows you to play the market for transactions. I've sent 7-8k in the past with a 0.79$ fee. Did it take a while? Sure, I went for a 9.995 sat/byte fee purposefully to test it out, so I did it voluntarily. I could have paid the suggested 300-400 sat/byte fee at the time, but I felt it unnecessary. Had the time been critical, I could have paid a greater fee to get on the blocks first. It's congested at times and far from perfect but I prefer a well thought out fix to a quick patch with untenable scaling models. At the moment you can get fast transactions ~~of~~ or cheap transactions... in the future, we can strive for both at the same time. 


The problem in talking about laws and regulations is that there is no global law or regulation, it's all national, and the world is a market for many things, not just goods and services, but also people and talents. While some countries will (and already do) push for harsher regulations and crackdowns, others will be more open, and I think it's quite logical to assume these will thrive (There was a video by Andreas a while back where he tackles this issue, I'll try and find the link...)
Yes, the whole "it's for criminals" narrative will still be used, but it's less and less relevant, due to the number of legitimate businesses that accept it and the relevancy it's given by markets joining in (See Futures markets and other such services)

Transactions are only uncensorable when the system is decentralized. If it's all government owned, then it's just a public ledger of everyone's spending and earnings. When you control the nodes, the minting ability and force the usage, you can just blacklist address IDs or find a number of other ways to restrict usage. I mean, it's not perfect all of a sudden just because it has blockchain in the description.

I never got this criticism. Like, people won't stop buying food, or goods, or clothes, or utilities just because their money is going to grow in Value. It might have an effect on consumerism to the extent that people may not buy futile things as much, but I see it more as reshaping the economy than taking it down. Perhaps investing in better quality, longer lasting products will become a thing again, rather than relying on planned obsolescence. Though I'm not sure what that will do as far as technological upgrades... Interesting to analyze, for sure.

@_date: 2017-12-04 20:57:25
A deflationary money with a fixed supply can to some extent calculate the deflationary value change. Instead of increasing salaries by x amount yearly, the opposite could be done, reducing the payout. Totally against current knowledge and feelings, but if the buying power is not reduced, it has no major adverse effect. It's just not possible to really model this with the current price change due to low adoption rates, exponential growth in users and hyper-volatility. We're talking way down the line here...
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:04:38
Like many wallets it generates a new address for every transaction. In the same way that your address changes every time you receive funds. It's a protection measure. So say you have 2 bitcoin on address x and send 1 to address y it will basically send 1 to y and the balance to a new address z (instead of back to x), still on your device, still created from your seed but as a new ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:07:11


Don't get too cheeky, dude, the same can be said about your comment. 
To be fair, what I see here is more experimentation and speculation than clear cut economic "science". Will it tank the economy? Sure, probably, though it will be more of an accelerant than a catalyst. Will it have downsides? yes,potentially devastating ones, at least in the short term, but it's also likely that it will rewrite economic principles. The thing with this whole space is that there is not absolute "correct way" of going about things. It's also why Hayek was against a Nobel-like prize for economics.

While I agree with Schiff on a load of social issues, and some financial points, his position on cryptos is totally unreasarched and biased. The same concerns he has of cryptos can be made of gold and the same speculations. I'd even argue that gold being physical has more of a risk of being lost, especially if it is "safely stored in a vault in some bank" :P He either can't understand it or doesn't want to due to his investments in gold...

True, because it's more than simple book studies. Though you could probably challenge credits and reduce the time to get a degree which is required for practice. But you wouldn't be able to skip the residency and all that. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if the systems over time allowed for more flexibility. I mean, as long as you reach all the requirements, the way in which you reach them and the time frame should be irrelevant, if you comply.

How do you redeem them? It's like an IOU, so how do you make sure you actually get the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:54:01
It's managed by the difficulty calculations. Say there are tons of miners mining, the hashrate is high, blocks get mined maybe a bit faster than once every ten minutes, the difficulty adjustment kicks in and makes it harder to get blocks. If it becomes unprofitable, you see a lot of miners jump to another coin, thus lowering the hashrate towards the blockchain. If it slows down block finding too much, the difficulty readjusts again after a few blocks (2016 I think) and makes it easier to mine again, thus attracting the miners back to the chain.

A lot of people were predicting a drop and a return to alts, since many flocked to BTC in hopes of getting the 2x coins. I think the fact that the fork was cancelled would bring the assumptions that people would do what they had planned for fork day, flock back to alts... and that's what the market is showing. Cheap BTC in time for payday tomorrow :P

Depends on the stocks and the markets. Risk mitigation implies spreading on relatively safe alternates. If you count the USD as being in trouble, not sure the stock market is a good place to "mitigate". It depends on your economic outlook.

It depends what you interpret as 


The protocol is common, sure, anyone can run their node and check the validity of the network, and the development is shared and open, but that's about it. The use of the actual Bitcoin is very capitalistic and by nature, more libertarian.

Only if he had the public/private key pair generated before the fork. If it's a new address, those coins will be lost, unless I'm missing something.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:16
Well, you do agree to forego that anonymity when dealing with a regulated exchange. It's the price to pay for having a convenient entry/exit point. Until there are good Decentralized exchanges or other ways around it is what it is :(
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:02:04
The thing with replay attacks is that your public/private key pair is the same on both sides of the fork, so the BTC transaction could be replayed on the s2x side and still be just as valid, and vice versa. Thus the danger in losing your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:33:24
The trick is getting a talented dev team, enough network adoption, people running nodes and miners mining your coin, and remaining resistant to attacks. If you lose 10-20% of value every time the hashpower moves around, it makes it harder, and if people dump you for something else every time news hits about a fork, it also removes that network effect. 
Even alts, I'm curious to see how many will recover post fork. Will people go back to the ratios their portfolios had or will they follow the profits? I believe the alt coin market to be more one of speculation than people believing in the value of the tokens/coins...
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:20:05

I think it's fair to assume a lot of the people who were on the BTC train solely for the s2x coins and who thought that the 2x chain would take over BTC jumped ship back to BCH when the 2x was called off. But even then... going from like 300 to 2400 in about a week's time smells more of a pump and dumb than an organic move. Also most of the money is from the same location, on the Korean exchanges...

@_date: 2017-11-21 02:40:54
There's no "one size fits all" answer to this. It depends on a lot of things such as how much you have invested and how much that's worth to you or rather, how much you fear losing it. 
If it's a few bucks, perhaps a few tens or hundreds, a bread wallet works great, it's also handy for quick transfers. If you start having more and are worried about losing them, then a HW wallet can be a good place to start looking. And beyond that, there are other even safer cold storage wallet options. The good thing about the HW wallets is that the keys themselves never leave the physical device, especially with the Nano S, so there's no risk (that I'm aware of) of software corrupting it to steal your keys. Just make sure you fully check the send/receive addresses on your transactions.

I see your point, but there's a difference in using an exchange as an entry/exit point and storing something on it for the long term.
History shows that storing on exchanges is a MtGox waiting to happen again, but the risk is minimal if you send them to/from a cold storage wallet and use the exchange only for what its name suggests... to exchange.

Plenty of less decentralized blockchains, like tether, or any number of the ones relying on master nodes or PoS, or whose development is done behind closed doors.
The decentralization comes from many things: the ability to join in at any time by mining (requires no permission), the ability for anyone to contribute value to the open-source code, the ability for virtually anyone to run a full node (not relying on third party trust but verifying) and so on.
Blockchain without bitcoin is a glorified ledger...

That's the general idea, but it does get drowned by all the roller coaster memes and twelve price posts for every dollar change.

Not so certain about a competitor overtaking it. Its appeals are its stability, the fact that it's had 100% uptime and the talented devs behind it. No other crypto can match that. And since many devs have clearly stated that they would not work on other cryptos if this failed, I think it either booms with bitcoin at the center, or all of crypto dies out... the altcoin market is far more filled with speculators than people who actually value the tokens / coins for their utility.

Remember too that many wallets generate new addresses every time you want to receive funds, which means that hypothetically, a person with say 50 BTC could have like a thousand addresses with 0.05 BTC each all pointing to the same wallet, making it harder to trace them all back to the same person. It's not anonymous, it's pseudonymous but it doesn't make it easy still.

I think that's just an effect of the fact that there are not enough mediums for buying goods/services directly in BTC, along with the insane volatility of its value/price. The more accessible and "mainstream" it becomes, the more likely you are to see transactions enacted in BTC prices, I think.

People bring up the same arguments for brexit and Trump. The same way people need to learn to manage their own keys and their own monetary sovereignty, they must also learn to get involved in their political systems.

Well  alert 
in S3 they state that most of the world goes for E-coin and that China is supporting Bitcoin which is causing a currency war. 
I think it'll be more the way of the west eventually being open to Bitcoin more and more (in the long run) and China and Russia among others trying to close off and build their own currencies. 
It's not that different from the show's scenario but I see Bitcoin as reaching the scale of the show's E-coin and whatever other national digital coins as being the exception.
But what do I know? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Technically, yes, you will have triple the coins, but keep in mind they won't all have the same value, it's not a 1:1 equivalency. As for trading the alts for bitcoin, it is possible, yes, but without clear replay protection on the s2x, I'll wait a bit and see how it will work.

The main issue that's not clear to me is how you access the new forked coins afterwards. Say I have x BTC in wallet A, after the fork, I should have x BTC in wallet A and also x BTC(Forked) in a new wallet. How do I get that address/keys for the newly forked coins. For info, I currently use a Nano S.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:57:41
Take my comments with a grain of salt, I'm fairly new to the scene, but I think the people in the cryptosphere live in a sort of bubble where by dealing daily with people that are also in the space (news, websites, twitter, reddit, etc.) you end up having a skewered view of the adoption of the tech.  I also think, as you do, that we're way far from mass adoption, and I think it's safe to consider that we're still somewhere between the "Innovators" and the "Early Adopters" phase of this whole thing.  Mass adoption is a long way away and there's still tons of space in the sandbox.

How do you enforce taxation on an asset that is not confiscatable? You can restrict the entry and exit points (exchanges) but only until the point where people circumvent them and go OTC or transact directly in it. Then your sole recourse is shifting from an income/wealth tax to a sales tax.
As for the strengths of bitcoin, it goes over the mere decentralization. The fact that it's got a 100% uptime and that it boasts a team of pretty legendary developers gives it a lot of value. It's why it outperforms the alts and its corporate offshoots. 
I mean, google can sure start their own gcoin if they want to, but even they have a steep hill to climb to make that a legit option and the market will ultimately decide. 
Until then, HODL, but the wheels are in motion, and whether Bitcoin fails or succeeds, there will be alternatives to the current markets and ways of doing things

At best one can hope that after a while, the track record of certain people will make others understand when shit is being peddled.

The forked chain is a copy of the original Bitcoin blockchain up to the fork, so any amount of BTC you had on a wallet to which you own the private keys, you will have the same amount of BTG/S2X coins on the respective chains, essentially free coins. Since they branch off the Bitcoin blockchain, they will be at the same public/private key as the originals.

Investments aren't savings as you can still lose out all you have invested. As for purchasing power, it's defined by how much your single unit of currency can buy you. Having an ROI of say 10% doesn't mean  your dollar buys 10% more stuff, only that you have 10% more dollars to spend, whose value is lower per unit than in the past.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:49:24
The Bitcoin brand also has notoriety, so anyone trying to get stuff done their way has more of an incentive to try and fork off the major player rather than some altcoin. It's probably why the other coins haven't had to demonstrate said resilience.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:08:45
I think the problem is large and comes with mass adoption. I'm sure a lot of people jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon not out of principle, but because of the FOMO and the Hype around the price, as the Coinbase userbase numbers can show. People look for quick avenues to BTC and don't research it wih enough depth. And I say this from the perspective where I believe I myself have fallen a bit in that path... or at least that's how I started. 
But when you decide to go in with a project, you should read up on it, on the tech behind it, on what it hopes to achieve and not see it as a short term money grab (as I assume many people do, though perhaps less on this sub...). Thankfully, Buying BTC or ETH on coinbase had a delay of about a week for me and I was more than able to research the tech, how to manage a wallet, to order a HW (and then a second) and to be a bit smarter about the whole approach. 
That being said, I think the current exchanges should indeed be simple on/off ramps and not stores for one's coins and I do look forward to seeing decentralized exchanges popping up.
Cheers ;)

It's as cold as you want it to be, you can keep the seed in the same manner you'd keep a paper wallet, in a waterproof, fireproof safe somewhere and perhaps in multiple parts. But in the meantime you have a pin-protected device that allows quick and easy use of the funds. If the hardware breaks, you lose it or you forget the pin, you can just reset it somewhere with the seed.

Noob question, as I'm no financial guru: How could they influence the price if they don't control the flow of Bitcoin?

This assumes people only use Bitcoin for store of value. If it gains mainstream adoption and stability and use as a day-to-day currency as well, that valuation has the potential to go through the roof.
