I gotta say, that's great that Bitcoin is getting more exposure, but is this really a good thing? Beck has sent a number of his devoted followers out to "invest" in Bitcoin. By and large these are older folks who really don't have any clue what they are investing in. Bitcoin is really not the place for them right now; it's still the wild west, and there's a 50/50 chance these people are going to lose money.

Exchanges are hardly a temporary phase, they are basically required for the Bitcoin economy to function. Without exchanges you have no way to index a currency against other currencies ie: there is no way to determine the value of a Bitcoin in relation to the dominant currency. The only way a Bitcoin economy could work at all without exchanges is if it was the only, or dominant, currency in the world.

I spent an hour this morning doing exactly that instead of, you know, my job.
  
When I opened CNN and read the MASSIVE BOLD HEADLINE "Bitcoin future in doubt" I just knew the comments would be filled with gloating, misinformed doubters. I didn't even bother to post, it would have been like a sheep in a blizzard, ain't nobody gonna see it...

Nah, it's cool, I have Prime.

Sure you can. You just need to find someone who is willing to accept your paper at a defined exchange rate of 1nontitlepaper = 1USD. The value of money is not defined by the money itself, but the market that is willing to accept it as currency. As long as Litecoin can carve out a market for itself it will succeed. That success may not be as large at Bitcoin's, but it's still success.

I don't mean to be rude, but why do you care? I see posts like this, or queries in other places, and I always wonder why someone asks questions like these. Why does it matter to you, or how does it affect you, that someone somewhere has moved a large amount of money?

The "maintenance" today was database related, I think the DB backend just blew an O-ring...

Are you aware a new term has been circling the Bitcoin community; Goxxed? As in, "Holy crap, did you see that piano fall on that guy's head? His ass got goxxed!". I just thought you should know, and wanted to ask how you feel about that?
