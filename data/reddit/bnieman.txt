My guess was that Apple pulled the biggest btc app off of the itunes store. Apple has basically waged war on bitcoin. 
Also combine that with the fact I think a lot of people are waiting for the govt to sell their 28,000 btc from Ulbricht.....Even though it won't be sold on an exchange it will still flood the markets most likely. Just lots of buyer uncertainty, but I think its a good time to buy. It's way over sold right now, I just picked up a couple more myself.

Gox already anounced the plan to do so.....just no one knows when. Personally I'm in favor.

Can you pay for them with other btcs?

Russia btc ban, and Apple pulled the popular btc apps from itunes store too. 
Huge support at $690 though, and it's not going below that. It's definitely a good buy right now. I bought a few more.

+1. It will bottom out and then could climb to $1,500 or 2,000 before the next crash. Only thing that is certain about crypto's is its volatility.

Haha, can't count the number of times I've done that, and then have to suck it up and buy higher because I know it's rallying. Cest la vie....thats the risk for trying to increase amount instead of buy &amp; hold.

If it's bad enough to drop to $10, it will go to $0 then......No way it will ever get down to $10. It's global now. Plus lets watch it in the wake of government crisis here in the next year or two when the USD is no longer the worlds reserve currency.

More like the stupid government will destroy the dollar!!!

Considering that the value of BTC will probably go up more than $0.50 in the amount of time it takes to actually send that BTC, I'd say no...

Good post. The market is also extremely saturated with "new" investors, and not stock pros. This is another reason why fluxuations can be so drastic; people panic sell at any short-term threat, and buy heavily during rallys. Most of the time panic sellers get screwed (happened to me a few times), especially after they realize its only a minor correction which happens from things being over or undervalued. We all live and learn :)
