The problem is the IRS will want to double dip. Dip on the capital gain of his original currency conversion and dip again on how much his BTC is worth today compared to when he first exchanged.

Gold in itself has no real value either outside of being an excellent conductor. It, just like cash or crypto derives it's worth from our imparted beliefs. 
As for cash. The USD is backed up by something greater than gold. It's backed up by the labor of the American people. It's okay to, in fact required to continually print more as the population grows as each dollar represents a unit of work that wen't in to justifying it's creation via. a loan of some sort. The value of the dollar sinks when there is no work, no labor to justify it's existence.

Just because cryptos are finite in nature doesn't mean they're not fiat either. I can't build a shelter with or eat cryptocurrency. They have no innate value in and of themselves. Their only value is derived from the faith we place in them. It's 100% psychological.

You're forgetting the most fundamental point of all. Something you would have noted as bullet point 0 on your list. That point I speak of is *faith*. It is the belief that other people will take my currency and give me something of value that is where a currency derives it's worth first &amp; foremost. Only after a currency holds the belief of the people do your three other astute points matter. Without faith a currency is useless.
Fundamentally speaking all currency is fiat. Yes all currency is fiat. That means Bitcoin and even gold. Being finite in nature doesn't exclude you from said designation. This is because they have no intrinsic value or usefulness in and of themselves. I can not build a shelter out of gold (easily, practically). I can not eat Bitcoin. They do nothing to satisfy the base levels of our Maslow(ian) hierarchy of needs. Whereas a goat in a primitive barter system does. What they offer is a useful medium of representation.
These two principles are very important and often overlooked.

I... don't think you understood. You're losing sight of the fact that the government guarantee (restitution) is in the form of something that is just another *representation* of wealth. Whether that restitution is in gold or sterling doesn't matter.

Very well said. I believe in crypto but I and I hope the rest of the community isn't so naive to drink the cool aid too vigorously here.

I think you and many other are drinking the cool aid too hard. Dollars may be shitty in their own right but they're still in common use. Very few landlords will accept rent in bitcoin, very few groceries will exchange you food in bitcoin. So, if you're putting your USDs in BTCs just so you can take out some USDs later then you're doing it wrong. **Only buy BTCs that you expect to spend as BTCs.** Bitcoin is not a commodity or a company so don't treat it as so. Don't treat it as a hedge either. It's a currency with crowd verified security, that's all. 
Whether it's gold, dollar or bitcoin what all currencies have relied on since the beginning of time is one simple attribute, faith. That's where the real value in a currency lies.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:41:23
Good points. I'd just like to add that we're treating a currency here as if it were a commodity or a company, which it's not. I believe BTC's endgame is to not replace common use currency but to become a universal exchange medium. To supplant the US dollar as the currency by which all others are weighed against. BTC, or any crypto is the first step towards a world currency. So we need to stop thinking of BTC's in terms of tulips to be day traded and more in terms of units of faith.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:45:36
Because it's not really meant as a common use currency. It's end game is that of a universal exchange medium. Supplanting the USD as the basis by which all other currencies are weighed against. BTC see's itself as a universal wealth indicator more than anything. You buy property, houses and large items with BTC. Not a bag of chips.

Gold is in itself not any different from your paper money. Its value is predicated entirely on human projection. You can not eat it, you can not build a house with it. Its main industrious purpose is that of an electrical conductor but that's not what makes it $1,300/oz. Gold's value is predicated entirely based off of what humans believe it to be worth, just like fiat money, just like crypto. They're all the same.
