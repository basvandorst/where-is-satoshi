That was the excuse literally every time in 2017. "Yah but China has banned it for good." "Yah but BCH has upgraded everything to counter the flaws of BTC". Yah but Yah but, and here we are. Still a stable price well over 10k.

Much of the people here aren't in the public eye trying to be some sort of manipulative shill though. There's a difference. I like BCH honestly, and I HATE Roger Ver.

24-72hrs isn't much of a correction.
Bitcoin hasn't had a correction since it dove back under $1000 for 3 long years.
THAT is a nice correction. 
This shit is just childs play.
FOMO-FUD cycle all over again.
BTC will break $20k, spike to $30k because of FOMO. Dip to $20k because of FUD. Recover to $30k and spike to $45k due to FOMO, then drop back to $35k due to FUD.
SO ON AND SO FORTH.
The only thing going for it is that the FOMO far outweighs the FUD whenever it's that time again.
People's hands are becoming stronger each time.
This kind of "correction" is very predictable and it's really a correction at all, as it is brought on purely by FUD, and followed up far too quickly with FOMO.

They sure do. But it doesn't make it okay.
It's like the sales philosophy of "if they don't say no, you followup until they do".
Yet, it's pretty fucking obvious after a solid year or so that if someone won't give in to your persistence you don't need to followup every fucking week. Yet they still do. And at a certain point, they know that it is fruitless, and that is when it turns from selling to harassment. 
Roger Ver doesn't know when to stop. That's the issue. You're right - he is a good salesman, the commentor didn't say he wasn't. In fact, some of the list even half-praises Ver in a way.
The point being made though is that the guy has nothing on his mind other than one agenda and he has no good intention behind it other than to benefit himself which can and will hurt others down the line.

My favorite part is the quote at the end:


Since when did it become vulnerable as well?
Also, this is the same Peter Schiff from this article 2-3months ago: 
He calls it a bubble. Integrates it due to growing demand. And then months later calls it a bubble again and says it's all over now.

OKAY WE GET IT. THERE ISN'T A DEFINITE PATTERN.
BUT YOU MUST ADMIT. THIS IS *DEFINITELY* A PATTERN...
Sick of people trying to say that this won't happen everytime. Okay, we understand, but literally 100% of the time it has happened so far. 
Maybe after it happens 10x, 100x, 1000x this way you will finally recognize the pattern? How many times must it happen before you submit? Please tell me!

I know this has been posted, but let's have a real discussion here people.
Economists since the dawn of time have come up with theoretical models for what is best for the economy.
But let us not forget ethics as well. Hume would agree that just because insider trading is better in theory doesn't mean it should be allowed.
Quoting a famous economist doesn't just write off something that is so obviously wrong. Also, if you care to know, Friedmans quote is being pulled from context, and doesn't 100% reflect his true stance. Roger is NOT an economist. 
I have my masters in economics and have read the very piece Bob Murphy plucked that quote from. It doesn't come off the same way it does in context as it does when you pull it out and put it in a different context like this.
Also, let us not forget a very classic example of something that is otherwise bad for the economy but is still implemented: minimum wage.
You need no economics degree to understand the simple model of minimum wage and how it creates dead weight loss in the market for labor.
Yet, here we are, in 2017, with minimum wages still being raised regularly. I repeat: just because something is better in theory in an economic model doesn't mean economists always agree that it is okay to apply it to reality, especially when it treads on ethical matters.
Please go read Hume if you care to know about the varying stances on ethics and economics as they relate directly.
Roger is just saving face by linking an interview with a dolt of an economist who is stuck in theory and has no regard for actual social and behavioral macro economics.
Are we going to just go quoting Keynes now and say that because he is a notable famous economist of back in the day, anything he said was right? Just plucking shit from Friedman doesn't make it right, same as just taking shit from Keynes wouldn't be right just because he is notably famous in the economic world.
Keynes is greatly criticized and he is just as famous as Friedman. Both have their stances and both are right in some ways and wrong in many others. Such is the nature of economics. Quoting old world economists though in today's world and thinking it always translates directly is completely off-base though.
Edit for structure.

You say that, but people were saying that when .01 was $20. When .1 was $300, when .25 was $1000. 
Notice anything there? Yah, the value just keeps going up.
If you bought $73.30 and got .01 today, and did that every month  (bought $73.30 worth) for the next 10 months, the odds are *heavily* in favor of you owning LESS than .100 by the end of ten months.
So it's your choice. Buy .100 for $733 now, or slowly commit to it over time, and own less than .100 once you've invested $733.

Thanks, I know none of us are super partial to CoinBase, but I really think they handled the upcoming fork in a manner that they will get more people just sticking with them this time instead of hiding their coin in private wallets.
CoinBase makes money when people are keeping their coin on the exchange because they are more likely to do their transactions there, so I feel like they really saw how much they lost last fork by not having same day capability of selling the forked-coin through their exchange (which they make profits off the fees when you cash it out). This time they are offering that option so they don't miss out on all those fee charges they lost last time. It's smart of them, and it really does tempt me to just leave my coin there this time around.

I liked the article because it didn't forget to point out why this isn't a big deal that in the short term BTC dropped relative to altcoins.

People who think bitcoin mining is wasting energy need to take a look at the millions of hosting server that exist, and the warehouses built on huge plots of land solely dedicated to servers made for "cloud" space
"Wasting" energy on running computers to make money is already happening on a much larger scale than bitcoin mining.

Thanks dude for laying out what it would take if you wanted to keep privacy and still be able to exchange your shit2x on the same day as the fork.
At least now I know.

This, except don't forget to mention that BTC is setup for deflation.
In many years, the price will make a very large correction over time, but never bounce back. Those years are still far away, look for that when BTC supply runs out and most every coin is being held. The price will hit an all time high because supply is empty and that means it will be very far left - causing price to rise drastically. But once you hit that inelasticity- it will correct over time and then become truly stabilized.
Until then, there is much money to be made.

If they crashed it, they would buy back and inflate it over time again.
Also, you don't have to actually know the exact math to understand that slowly milking it down is always more profitable than crashing it in droves. By that I mean like cutting the market by 50%. Sure, they chop 20-30% off in a day, or a even in a month - but cutting the market by selling so much that it crashes massively, will not net them as much profit as it would if they did it in smaller percentages and kept moving up and down but mainly down.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:38:43
No. You have wayy too little. Sell it immediately. Buy $200 worth again at if it goes under $3000 and you'll already be ahead of the curve.
You have too little to worry about holding tho. You can safely sell and buy back at any lower price and be better off

Wasnt fake, but was reported improperly.
BTCC is voluntarily shutting down. Other large exchanges will continue to operate as normal and currently still are.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:04:58
Technically the IRS files BTC exchanges under property taxes, so there have been billions of "real estate" purchases prior to now :)

Its still dropping. So, no, not as you speak/spoke. But sure, in the long run- maybe

This is the absolute truth.
When everything is speculation, this of all things can be said to be concrete.
If BTC tanked $4000 in a month, you're basically saying that the majority of the absolute largest whales invested in BTC, all decided that this fun is suddenly over.
You really think the 1%'ers of BTC are done making money yet?? LOL.
If it hit $1000, it would hit $4000+ within a day after. The thing is, it would never tank THAT fast. If it was going to $1000 it would be milked down to that number on millions of day trades for the next few years and kept on a full steady decline. That way the people fully selling out really squeeze every last penny out of their massive investment before exiting the market and calling it dead.
But what haplens then? They go invest in banks? No...they look and say, "hey, there's this thing called cryptos, and they look super exploitable if we dump a bunch of cash into it and manipulate the market over time, let's make some moola!".
Needless to say, they would come back and inflate the value again because of the same reason they did in the first place.
If I had $500m, I would manipulate the fuck out of the market along with the biggest players and sap it for a shit ton of money too. It's kind of like gambling in a way: when you have small bankroll, you can only play slow- but when you have a large bankroll you can absolutely cash in on the things that you might make "$100!" on, but if you have a huge bankroll, those $100 wins become $1000, and $10000.
 Imagine that, but amplified because that's what it's like when these big players are day trading. You bttwr fucking believe they aren't just going to completely tank the market and leave suddenly when they are making THAT much by playing with the market in increments of 10%, as opposed to 75%...

This is almost like asking if there's a way to get shady foreign places to stop doing the Nigerian Prince scam. 
Not gonna happen. Financial Scams will always exist as long as humans are susceptible to error; therefore, they will exist forever - in one form or another, for one currency or another.
