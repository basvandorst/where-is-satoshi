No, not faith in gox. Faith in the bankruptcy process as the best chance for anyone to get anything back. You can be sure the coins aren't coming back.

The fundamental issue in your post is getting payments processed which can happen at least two different ways. 1. An existing adult payment processor will develop their own Bitcoin solution and it will be used for non-sex-worker stuff as well. 2. Someone from the adult industry will create their own payment processor that specializes in Bitcoin payments. 
Now, about that crowdfunding, what kinds of projects were notably shut down in the past?

The people who have any chance at paying anyone back have access to all of this information. For it to be exposed to anyone and everyone benefits almost nobody. Maybe we should expect every piece of data to become public at some point, but that doesn't mean we have to support the effort.

Time to stop what you are doing and learn about security. Visitor connections to your site are not protected with SSL and account creation happens via an unencrypted POST form. Perhaps helping people who don't know what SSL is to run poker sites is where the opportunity is.

This is a good use case for a simple app that could scan qr codes, provide exchange rate quotes and send sms.

Some people won't be satisfied until you sign a message with an address you contol. Don't worry about it though. Your OP is interesting whether it's true or not.

The DDOSers are realizing that MtGox isn't going to release their funds based on these attacks and are giving up. There is such a thing as too big to DDOS (google, baidu, etc.).
