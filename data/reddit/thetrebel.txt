@_date: 2014-03-11 03:36:49
case in point 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:24:01
Not really
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:24:38
lol here is the problem with the BTC community 
-Rather than listen to criticism you down vote 
-The emotional investment some people have toward BTC makes me worry they have more money than they can afford to lose
-I have seen people on here claiming they have their life savings in BTC, if you bring it up they get defensive, rather than be objective its all "To DA MOOOON!!"
TLDR: BTC community has become to attached to their investment. When emotions control these kind of decisions, your gonna have a baaaaaaaad time 
downvote me idc :D:D

No brick or motor. "Street wear clothing ". Pretty big in the skater and hip hop community. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:39:34
Yes. The straight lines are s/r. This is the foundation of my TA. Support are price levels where people refuse to sell. Resistance are price levels where people take profits. These levels get broken the more they get touched. As you can see on the charts support is being broken. 
If you learn anything, learn support and resistance.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:32:15
I swing trade/invest in stocks. I day trader forex. I don't really use indicators, when I do its both stochs and macd. If you look at the 15min chart price formed a downward channel. You could have shorted when it reached the top of the channel, or when it broke support. You could have also gone long on the break of resistance. Also worth noting when resistance is broken, it becomes support. These levels are not set in stone. But they work enough to be profitable.  
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:26:16
lol that happened
