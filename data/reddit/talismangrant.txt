Thanks for the input I didn't realize that you did the Automatic BTC to CAD...that seems to be the most desired feature I have heard from retailers. They unanimously don't understand nor trust bitcoin so auto conversions make all the difference.
I use QuadrigaCX exclusively to buy BTC so this is another great feature I can explain to people about your platform.

I am.. surprised...that is the word.  Why are banks shutting down bitcoin activities?
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:15:43
no problem

I've used QuadrigaCX and have no issues, they have multiple ways to send you your money.
Bank transfer, cheque, interac e transfer, bank wire, visa, paypal all for free  and or western union or virtual visa but these 2 options have a fee.

There are examples of lost coin.. wasn't there a guy who had his cold wallet thrown out or the dead guy who never let his heirs know about his wallet etc?

How does it leave? 
When there are more people and businesses using it every day.
It is becoming more circulated.
I pay my son 20% of his allowance in bitcoin and he uses it to bet with his buddies with online games, 25cents a game, winner takes all.
Fun for now but soon enough they will be able to use this currency for real world purchases.
We all need to find ways to bring bitcoin into the real world daily use.
Sooner or later there will be a coffee shop or a gas station that takes it locally, that is when exponential growth will really begin.

I don't think I agree.
The money only leaves the bitcoin system if they are lost or destroyed. Every time a bitcoin is bought or used it becomes part of the bitcoin economy. Even if a miner is cashing bitcoin to pay power bills the coins go somewhere.
If you mine and hold then those coins are a negative force. The way to increase coin value is by using them for real world purchases. 
Adoption as a payment system is where the increased value is at, from a currency perspective. But I still think that market is less than 10% of the Bitcoin value. Clearing, asset verification, voting, records aspects etc seem like they may dwarf the currency.
