Okay, here we go. I'm just going to ignore the rest of your response and show you what credibility means. Let's just examine the source you provided.


A quick google search provides, what do you know, absolutely nothing about this guy other than links to this same document. I won't even call it a publication because he is clearly not a researcher and does not even attempt to identify himself as a financial expert, economist, or economic historian. Even if he did, it's quite clear that that would've been a baseless claim and if you can't provide proof for who you are then there's no reason to believe it.
Then I went to this webpage which hosts the same document (the link on there is broken, but the content is consistent with what has appeared with him on other sites). 
Let's just walk past the "abstract" and examine a couple of the quotes extracted from his paper (I checked - they're in the paper).


“I believe that  banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing  armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set  the government at deﬁance. The issuing power \[of money\] should be taken  away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly  belongs.” —*Thomas Jeﬀerson*  
This quote is not accurate. Thomas Jefferson said something *similar* but this is a misconstrued quote and any CREDIBLE researcher would have quickly figured that out (it only took me a matter of seconds). 


Again, a quick google search and you'll find out that this quote has NO primary source and no one who uses it is able to offer one up. Please tell me if you're able to find a PRIMARY source because you will be **the first person ever** to offer one up! So again, not something CREDIBLE researchers fall for. 
Then there's this. A glowing endorsement for G. Edward Griffin, renowned conspiracy theorist (page 58 of the document).


Here's a link to G. Edward Griffin's wiki with a small excerpt from his summary:


This is one of the references used by the author you provided. A straight up clown and conspiracy theorist who claims to have figured out all kinds of "truth" about the world. **HUGE red flag**. And - shockingly - he's not an economist, economic historian, or financial expert. 
**This is what a NON-CREDIBLE source looks like and that is why** **you need to use CREDIBLE sources.** No REAL researcher would have fallen for ANY of this because they know how to evaluate CREDIBILITY. When you rely on people to teach you about VERY complicated fields who have absolutely no involvement or deep knowledge of the subject this is what you get. If anyone tries to demonstrate their mastery to you and says "you should listen to me" about ANY discipline like math, science, or history, you should ALWAYS evaluate their CREDIBILITY (who are they, what have they done, what can they demonstrate, etc.).
So, in summary, that source is a joke. His sources are jokes, and his information was easily debunked. That is what happens when you trust people who don't have **CREDIBILITY.**

Internal sources..? Why would anyone trust that reference..?
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:14:15
It's actually the best thing we've ever tried so far. Money is a continual experiment and people who understand the evolution of money can demonstrate it.
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:25:58
Reputation is very important when making claims like these. Demonstrating consistently contrarian views in the face of overwhelming conflicting evidence is cause to doubt a person's credibility especially on complex matters. One guy claiming as much knowledge as this guy should be a huge red flag to anyone.
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:30:58
I just showed you illegitimate quotes cited by a "researcher." Go find a legitimate professor's research and you'll see that they don't fall for these simple mistakes because they know how to conduct ACTUAL research. This is not difficult. Any credible scientist knows how to evaluate sources.
It's hard to believe, I know, but the low-caliber, know-nothing, non-expert conspiracy theorists are wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:41:17
But it's not as simple as a "misattributed quote." It's downright piss poor research for her to have made that kind of mistake. Credible researchers do not make that mistake. The overarching theme doesn't matter when your credibility as a researcher is unreliable. 
Gary Allen didn't just say that quote was wrong (and that no real researcher would fall for it). He said that her research as a whole was piss poor and that SHE is wrong.
By the way, she has changed her position a complete 180 degrees and actually now endorses the modern paradigm. 
Are you sure you still trust that "research" of hers?
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:02:27
That sounds more like a corrupt management problem than a general banking problem.

I enjoyed a good bit of the video! The neutral tone presented towards much of the information was appreciated. However, the shadowy banksters and illegitimate quotes are still a problem.
Like this one at the 39:20 mark, for example:


This is the same quote provided in the video but extracted from the following website: [
Gary North is an actual economic historian. Ellen Brown is not. Apart from that, the lack of source material is a big red flag. The quote cannot be verified because it is a bogus quote. Anytime somebody quotes someone else but can't (or won't) provide a legitimate source for their information, it usually means they are not worth listening to.
So interesting video but, yet again, not credible.
Here's another one for you from that video:


Here's an analysis of that quote: [
And then here is Ellen's response: [
Ellen Brown removed this bogus quote from her own book after one of her reader's alerted her that it is fake. It took three years for a reader to spot it.
Still trust this quality of research?

Okay I guess I don't blame you. 
Just don't understand why you people stick to your beliefs like it's your religion. I already know your sources dwell in the W Cleon Skousen, Jim Marrs, G Edward Griffin realm of authors so you don't need to offer them up. The reputations and credibility of these guys has been shot down a long time ago (even by the guy they reference the most - Carroll Quigley). 
A quick look at their wikis should raise a big red flag. Why do you guys just ignore it..?
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:19:08
C'mon man. You can't convince anyone with an argument like that. Who else is there?
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:18:50
Fiat is evil? What is your source for this claim?
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:06:50
Oh you mean this guy?
The guy who thinks he knows where Noah's Ark is, the cure for cancer, and denies HIV/AIDS among other things?
Who else ya got there?

It might be easier to substitute the word reputation for "credibility." Credibility is EVERYTHING when you start making assertions and drawing radical conclusions about a complicated field that you DO NOT KNOW. I wouldn't listen to an artist, musician, or salesmen tell me about how climate change is NOT real because I know they haven't put in the **thousands** of hours that REAL climate scientists have. Since there is an overwhelming consensus among the experts in this field that it is a real thing, I will trust them and check their research WAY before I trust conspiracy theorist Billy Bob. And the same goes for economics, monetary policy, finance, etc.


Yes, and that's why you need to research what EXPERTS have said because they know way more than conspiracy theorist Billy Bob.


I'm not interested in engaging in circular philosophical reasoning like "what is evil?" That's not my point. My point is that the "banks are evil just look at this conspiracy theory written by a nobody" echo chamber that exists in this community is toxic. Why don't the "banks are evil" people demand a higher level of credibility from the authors whom they listen to?


Thank you for citing someone CREDIBLE. Interesting to see that he believes the Fed was the reason for the Great Depression. However, my position isn't that the central banks are perfect and never make mistakes. My position is that the conspiracy theory circle-jerk concerning big banks "ruling the world" is false and that's why I challenge the people who make these assertions.


You don't have to. Fiat has it's issues just like any system would have (including commodity money).

Sorry but you're going to need a better source than that. 
First, I can hardly find anything on S. Chris Anders. He's apparently some right-wing guy but I can find nothing to substantiate his reputation which is a red flag. I don't take world views on complicated matters from random people who are not experts in their respective fields. Just like I wouldn't trust Joe Shmoe to teach me about rocket science or chemistry but an ACTUAL scientist. As far as I can tell, he's not an economist, financial expert, or historian. He is not a credible source.
Second, based on his talking points he clearly listens go G Edward Griffin who is a known fringe conspiracy theorist and medical quack. A quick look at his wiki should raise big red flags for you. Unless you believe he's so smart he's figured out the cure for cancer, that HIV/AIDS is a lie, where Noah's ark is, and other wacky assertions. Which, of course, means that all the experts in these various fields have somehow been shown up by an absolute nobody who knows nothing about their fields. Anyone claiming to have that kind of knowledge should raise HUGE red flags for you. He is also not a credible source.
Same thing goes with Ron Paul (who apparently this Anders guy has worked with). Ron Paul also believes G Edward Griffin because he doesn't have a clue about finance of economics. Have you noticed that no financial experts or economists talk about this? Yeah, that's because they know it's not accurate. 
Even Carroll Quigley (the original source for these conspiracy theories) has said that this is a lie and was a blatant distortion of his work (like W Cleon Skousens work).
So either bring somebody credible to the table or forget about it.

Venezuela's problems are not a fiat issue, though. They're an economic issue. No matter what financial system you have irresponsibility is going to wreak havoc.
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:21:43
Venezuela sucks, we know. What do you think Bitcoin is going to do about it? You think Bitcoin is just going to magically solve their problems?
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:18:13
Banks are evil? Interesting. Where did you get that from?
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:45:24
Dude...what? 
I've known about this guy for years and actually have read some of his book. It's very strange and not scholarly at all. Don't you think that if he was right then there would be a bunch of PhD historians and other SMEs (economists, etc.) coming out and saying the same thing? Instead we see the exact opposite. The only PhD referenced for any of this banking conspiracy stuff is Carroll Quigley who himself has said these guys are wrong. 
It's just weird to see so many people willing to accept radical assertions by people who have no business making such claims. Why don't real historians demonstrate this instead of these guys?
The thing that bothers me the most is that I don't understand - why do you guys WANT to believe them?
