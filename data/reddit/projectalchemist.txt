The reality here is that BCH has played into the lowest common denominator's biggest gripe in recent memory - transaction fees and scaling. 
Although this concern is totally justifiable, and does need to be addressed, a short-term bandaid isn't going to resolve Bitcoin's overall adoption. All it will do is make people feel good short-term, and encourage similar behavior in the (possible) near future when the issue arises again.
Long-term BCH's "solution" is not feasible (would inevitably rid Bitcoin of any resemblance of decentralization), however by appealing to disgruntled users wanting immediate benefits of in-development Bitcoin features today, the BCH conglomerate has been able to capture a portion of the BTC audience.
BCH is led and dictated by a group of people countable on one hand, along with impatient/disgruntled Bitcoin users. Although a manipulator will look you in the eyes and say "I'm just here for the betterment of the software!", the reality is their motives are much more nefarious (as proven by their actions). 
BTC is led and dictated by hundreds of developers from all over the globe, hundreds of thousands of users, and integrated into a plethora of vendor's business flows. If you want Crypto to succeed, you want BTC, the original chain, to succeed until crypto has become so mainstream that it won't matter anymore.

Stand strong, and the community shall prevail. 
Patience is a virtue in the game of life, underlying value &amp; support will trump panic &amp; manipulation in the long run.
