Love this comment, and you are right.  Everyone is debating as if one thing means the success of bitcoin will or won't happen (whether for or against a block increase), and they are wrong.  Bitcoin is a protocol, and while we can improve it, there are so many pieces that will be built in and off the protocol that will make a difference.

There making an announcement on the 11th.

thanks, I'm taking away my comment.  My frustration is with the direction the entire debate is going on the list, but its great to know that was not a dev.

Great analysis.  Reading something like this, its hard for me to not support some type of block size increase.
Whats more concerning to me though is not the block size increase, but how Bitcoin as an open source project can continue to be somewhat agile and not get bogged down in constant debate.  If there will be any downfall to Bitcoin, I believe it will be this, not the blocksize or any other problem thrown out which smart engineers can solve.

what state is that?
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:04:37


This is true, but in meantime, the a bit license allows a company to operate under all of the 50 states until a state specifically clarifies that it does not.  This was something Lawsky mentioned in the speech.
No doubt about it, its a hurdle that will make it difficult to have a startup in the near and more so in the long term that requires a license.  At least many of the companies are exempt and now have legal clarification of their exemption.

Agreed.  I have no problem with being polite about it, that was not the case here is was lined in a post of stabs.

Not necessarily.  It showed they could grow revenue quickly, and it showed they were walking away from something that was bringing in significant revenue for something they felt was bigger.

I could see it working.  Manufacturers are use to squeezing pennies/dimes for cost savings.  If you have a device that would help them generate even an extra $1 or $.25, I think many would be open to it so long as the concept is proven.

Highly unlikely.  If bitcoin becomes worth a lot, its likely his investments will be worth the same or more as investing directly in bitcoin.  It makes sense why a VC would invest in the companies that would lead in bitcoins evolution.  It just so happens that it also makes sense for those who can't invest in a company directly, to invest in bitcoin to try and be part of the growth in this evolution.

Possibly Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin/bitcoin.  At the very least one of the earliest and most influential thinkers in the crypto-currency space.

He said in the same interview he didn't really know where it would be or what it would be to people in 5-10 years.  As he put it a driverless carriage, the car, is not anything like a horse and carriage.
The problem is he gets sound bit so it sounds sensational.
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:05:30
Especially since he made that before the problems began at MtGox.  Andreas also showed MtGox solvent.  There were others big in Bitcoin who believed in MtGox as well.  Bottom line, its a low blow to distract the from the true scandal going on right now with OKCoin.

Two Questions...
1) How is Factom secured when its merkel tree anchor is not yet placed on the blockchain?
2) Do you hold any bitcoins as a long term investment? :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:44:54
I can't stop smiling :)  I didn't expect something like this to happen for quite some time, my mind is blown...

ChangeTip is a really interesting idea to me because while it uses Bitcoin, I'm not sure it couldn't just as well have used USD (since a deposit has to be made).
The growth they've had though should show the future of the tipping society is only growing.  I think this is awesome.  Eventually I could see the number of unique tipping users, the content they generally tip, and the tips they give even being used as content quality indicators for search engines.
For now though, its great to have a company like this doing it in BTC as it helps our adoption, and fosters giving tips to those who often deserve revenue but don't receive it for their work.

That was actually pretty awesome.  The way they simplified 2fa was great as well.  I would use it if it were available.

yep, he's a multi billionaire.  The amount he owns is a very small percentage of his portfolio.

Your comment does not deserve the down votes.
Bitfinex has a trading volume of about 31,000 BTC in the last day, and thats just one Bitcoin exchange.  GBTC on the other hand so far today has traded about 301 shares, or an equivalent of about 30.1 BTC.  I believe yesterday around close it did around 75 BTC of trading, or a better 1 day comparison.
I get the excitement over GBTC trading, it is exciting to think we've come this far.  I'll be more excited when the ETF is live, which I think could have some impact on the market price.

The way they store data on the blockchain, I'm not sure it would create much upward price pressure.  However, giving the blockchain increased and real utility may increase its value over time.

I never said one company, thats why investments is plural.
He can also own a higher percentage of a diverse portfolio of companies, than own a high percentage of all bitcoin (much more difficult).  Of course he's a multi-billionaire, so he could own quite a bit of bitcoin, but the main point I'm making here is he's diversifying both to help grow the ecosystem, mitigate his risk, and make money.

Theres not enough bitcoin for 1/2 of the world to buy 1/100th of a bitcoin.
7 billion world population / 2  = 3.5 billion.
21 million bitcoin / 3.5 billion = .006 bitcoin

Good point.

Could just be there way of saying we'll announce funding later this week.  Could be something else...
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:59:13
Never announced but it was rumored to be about 80-100 million when they raised 17 million last time.

Insider trading is not illegal on BTC exchanges.  There are no laws or regulations against it yet.

Gripping tight gentelman

Yes it can be.  The poster is regularly negative, and jumping to conclusions here on something that is both positive for the Bitcoin community and Xapo.  It's highly likely a deal like this meant Xapo got the stats the social network wanted to show in the press release.
The real question is how many active users do they have?  No doubt though, the good news here is this is a major integration.
