Remember, technical analysis is neither technical nor analytical

Just messing :) no worries

I'm setting up my nano s tonight but mainly for BTC ETH LTC. What doesn't it support?

I'm not sure why your headline is different than the article's but I find it a little misleading.
Yes, the professor is nervous and skeptical as many people are. I read the article and it's fine. But what is their reasoning behind the claim? Not clearly explained.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:49:36
Agreed. But that's hardly an advantage  *because* usage is so low. ETH and LTC have crazy-high usage and low fees too! *That's* useful. And hopefully, BTC can get to that point, too.

The whole business of forking for one reason, then once you've forked changing your reasons seems sketchy as well.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:02:35
Oh I didn't know that about ETH/LTC.
And yes to handle billions of transactions a day, blocks would have to be in the multiple gigabytes every ten minutes which is a problem of untenable proportions.

Sure, I would want the name too. But after reading some of them legitimately think they should have the name. Which is confusing. If they really believe that, why did they leave?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:55:11
why both Gemini and Bitstamp? Different uses or?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:25
Cool, thanks. Impressive that you can increase your stack trading, I can't. Is that really passive though? Requires a lot of thought.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:03:56
If that was their argument I could see it, but I don't think they're saying that?
Yes, the market will ultimately dictate and that's something everyone should be concerned with so they improve. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:31:00
A fair point, but I am also asking about the ideology
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:22:14
Okay that's a good point, thanks for your perspective

Ideally the only time you have money on any exchange is right before you buy and sell. Then off to more secure accounts/wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:24:44
are you mining yourself or do you have a contract or something? Just curious
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:24:46
Another good argument, but we need some criteria to determine who/what's closer to the original vision. Because otherwise, both BTC and BCH can just claim they're closer. And I do think BTC has just as legitimate if not more legitimate of a claim to 'the original vision' as BCH does
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:35:17
So more of an ideological argument, it seems.
