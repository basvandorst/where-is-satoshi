210 BTC is a lot of money right now. 
Notice how I said "right now"? That's because it probably wasn't when you bought em. 
Lucky you! You've made a wildly successful investment that has the potential to greatly improve your son's life.
Nobody knows what the future of Bitcoin's price looks like. 
Should you sell them all and put them in an index fund? Of course not.
Should you keep them all because Bitcoin's price is obviously going to be the same or higher when he turns 30? OBVIOUSLY fucking not. 
I don't know what other plans you've made for your son's financial future (bravo for being a better dad than most people's by the way) but if this investment is the only one, or even a very significant one, I would seriously consider taking some profits out and diversifying your portfolio. 
Put some in an index fund, buy a bit of gold. Just don't leave all his eggs in the bitcoin basket. 
You've done a huge thing for your son, now you just have to make sure its still around for him to appreciate.

How much is it up since 2008? Because I'd wager the effect of the last 8 years on your portfolio has more to do with that most recent 13% than anything the last 4 months.
I'd further argue that if these last 3 weeks are any indication, the confidence reflected in that 13% might possibly be very seriously misplaced, as I'm of the opinion that someone this profoundly unhinged in that powerful a position can't simply be relied upon not to fuck everything up while the big boys retool the government to enhance Wall St's bottom line. 
The Presidency of the United States doesn't work that way. 
There will be consequences for his incompetence.

If someone could come up with an altcoin that fixed bitcoin's myriad issues and convinced a VC firm to throw a few billion into it and into marketing it to adopters and consumers, it could become a serious competitor to bitcoin, perhaps even eventually take over its market.
All you really have to do to kill bitcoin is to convince people that something else is better.

One can do the same thing with good old US Dollars these days. 
Anything of value is subject to theft, but steps can be taken to try and prevent the theft of one's gold, us dollars, or bitcoin that can make it extremely difficult for a thief to gain access to it.
Yes, bitcoin can be stolen, but it can also be stored entirely securely via paper wallets, memorized bip39 word phrases, cold storage devices or combinations of these things. 
Theres an argument to be made that these methods of securing funds are more secure than a pile of gold in a safe, or dollars in your bank account. 
I won't make that argument, but I certainly will hold to my argument that bitcoin is no less secure simply because it exists electronically. 
While many may not be used to being responsible for securing their own assets, that isn't the same as an asset being inherently less secure.

Can you really just memorize 12 words and keep them in your noodle forever, or is it possible those 12 words might at some point in the future be insufficient to restore your coins?
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:14:14
You're more right than the guy you're arguing with. 
I've been thinking for a while about the likelihood of some VC conglomerate dumping billions into creating and promoting their own user-friendly corporate version of Bitcoin. I think it could be one of the greatest threats to BTC one day. 
The only thing I see as possibly being able to save bitcoin from such a fate is that bitcoin is increasingly being seen as money, or at least as an asset, while our hypothetical new-and-improved CorproCoin will almost certainly be seen as a *product*, or service. 
In order to encourage mass adoption it will have to market itself heavily. In doing so it will be, essentially, trying to convince everyone it's worth something. Bitcoin doesn't have to do that because it already has. 
It will almost certainly be somewhat successful in its efforts (if it's not total crap) because it probably *will* have advantages that make it valuable. But it will have to further convince everyone that those advantages make it not only worth something, but worth MORE than bitcoin, in order to ultimately defeat it. 
This will naturally draw attention to many of the unique features of bitcoin that, as you mentioned, are neither commonly known nor cared about by most people now, and will therefore lead some to consider bitcoin an equal or better investment. 
At the end of the day, nobody really knows what's going to happen, but markets tend to behave and mature in predictable ways. 
One should temper any predictions about the obvious supremacy or inevitable demise of bitcoin by making use of such methods.

If a currency or economy suffers it affects every other asset on the planet. 
The only thing that really hurts an economy is when currency stops flowing through it. Bitcoin doesn't do this to any economy in any significant capacity. 
Some central banks may not like bitcoin for obvious reasons but I can assure you that some, maybe even the same, central banks that also see it as useful because they understand there are no good guys or bad guys in an economy, only niches that affect other niches. 
I say all this because people need to understand that central bankers aren't "afraid" of bitcoin and that it wouldn't necessarily be a good thing if they were.

That is my hope as well, since I love bitcoin, but I have to say if we can't reach consensus on increasing the blocksize - something that is going to need to happen on a fairly regular basis in perpetuity if Bitcoin is to truly ever become as immortal an investment as gold - then how can something as core to bitcoin's identity as its encryption ever find the near-universal consensus it will need to adapt to increasingly powerful decryption technology?
The greatest limiting factor to Bitcoin's life expectancy is current total inability to adapt to change.

Again we are in agreement, *almost*. 
While you're of course correct that it's only a matter of time before some other entity competes with bitcoin in these areas, I think you may not be so correct that people will inevitably value these areas more than whatever the value of bitcoin is at that point in time.
Basically, I'm arguing that whenever that point *does* arrive, the primary value that people will see in Bitcoin will be the value that people see in it today - it has value.
However easy-to-use, easy-to-scale, low-fee, high-speed or whatever its competition may be in comparison, it still won't compete in unless it can overtake bitcoin's value on the merit of those features alone. 
At least in the current environment, that seems unlikely, as bitcoin's popularity is driving it to greater adoption and pushing developers to work around its kinks to deliver a more friendly experience. 
Infrastructure is developing around bitcoin that will be challenging for a competitor to outstrip or obsolesce and that reinforces the value of the underlying asset in concrete ways. 
I think the longer bitcoin can survive, the greater its chances to continue doing so become.

AirBnB and Uber's legal evaison model involves ignoring local laws, and counting on the courts tie up cities in costly legal fights that usually wind up in their favor by tying up action against them for long enough to allow them to plant roots. It helps that they have a lot of money and experience to throw at these problems to ensure they win either via favorable legislative decisions, settlements with municipalities themselves or favorable judgement by the courts.
Bitcoin is different. If it is banned it doesn't have a PR team to spend millions on ads excoriating the government for hurting working families, it doesn't have teams of lawyers to block city hall or lobbyists to buy politicians. It'll just be another black market commodity.

This is how fads become institutions. Money brings people with money looking for more money. 
Any truly-viable product, service, asset or even cryptocurrency WILL bring big-money investors who'll try to squeeze all they can out of it.
The plus side is that the easiest way to do that (after making it cost more) is to promote it so its widely utilized by the masses. Which, of course, is what we all want for Bitcoin anyway.
Would it really be better if they all hit the road and the miners no longer saw a profit motive in mining?
Not to mention the macro-capitalist forces which already favor the hyper-concentration of wealth and industry influence across all markets and borders, regardless.

Building off of this, I'd say PayPal *currently* has advantages over bitcoin in terms of usability, but those advantages are all chiefly due to scale.
Bitcoin is just smaller than PayPal, but thanks to recent developments in scaling the protocol, that may not always be the case, and once it isn't: bitcoin will be vastly preferable to PayPal for all the reasons mentioned above, in addition to at that point being as or more fast and usable than PayPal.

I think the counterpoint to this might be that a "bad upgrade" - one without consensus like Segwit - simply would not be assumed to eventually be the preferred coin by rational actors as Segwit currently is.

This is a paradigm-level point. ^ 
Something very true that probably always will be.

Probably will not happen until/unless bitcoin is over $10000, simply because the quantities would otherwise be cumbersome. 
"Bitcents" or 100ths of a bitcoin (.01) roll off the tongue well and are probably most useful for now, since nobody really uses bitcoin for transactions smaller than a bitcent due to the current fee issue. 
You could even say "Ill give you half a bitcent" or "a quarter of a bitcent" rather than use "microbitcoins".

You know, as big as coinbase is, if Mt. Gox happened with them I don't think it'd be as big now as it was then. 
I definitely think it'd hurt the price, but most people have learned their lessons in terms of holding coins on exchanges, which is what caused the meltdown last time. Many people's wealth just vanished. 
This time I think their failure would be more about them and less about bitcoin in the investing public's eyes.

Its not supposed to compete with bitcoin. 
Its not supposed to be money.
It's meant to be the foundation for the next stage of the internet, and the everyone from the United Nations to Wall St to a hundred thousand tech startups and charity orgs and assorted private interests are beginning to take notice. Are you?

Activate Segwit, activate Lightning Network, don't destroy bitcoin by trying to screw over users/miners in the process because as much as either side may hate to admit it: we all need each-other to keep bitcoin truly consensus-governed.

What makes you think that's true? 
Did someone tell you that was true?

Its not unreasonable to think most if not all of that 30% will begin mining bip148 on or very soon after August 1st, now that Bitmain has announced their intention to hardfork.

First of all, people aren't using ethereum in the same ways they're using bitcoin. More application infrastructure is being built on the blockchain for ethereum versus bitcoin, which is primarily used as a store of value and unit of exchange in a way ethereum just isn't. They don't directly compete.


Secondly, If the debate is over whether *some* altcoin could overtake bitcoin, its important to remember that bitcoin - just like everything else - is subject at least to the laws of the free market, one of which is the law of fundamental value.
If the status quo persists, much of what gives bitcoin its fundamental value will eventually disappear. If nothing changes, as pointed out: 


If bitcoin ceases to function well as a unit of exchange due to transaction fees/times as is slowly happening now - it ceases to be good as money (or at least, it ceases to be as popular as other forms of money). The ordinary users all over the world who currently prefer it will be forced by economic necessity to search for alternatives, a number of which Bitcoin itself has paved the way to making readily available. 
At the very least, the status of bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency by unit would then be in serious jeopardy, which would in turn jeopardize bitcoin's other use cases - ie. freedom from central money-printing authority. 
All it would take is another crypto, say Monero, to gain popularity in that market (which it and others like it are specifically designed to appeal to), and boom: another use case for bitcoin is supplanted by superior tech. 
**TLDR: Bitcoin probably has to scale, or it's probably going to lose a lot of its value in the market.**

Wow, that's 6 minutes well spent right there. Changed my perspective.

Changing the blocksize, as you are obviously aware, comes with a host of its own issues - not the least of which being that every serious proposal to do it has been championed alongside other, bigger changes by people with interests other than those of the community at large in mind.
