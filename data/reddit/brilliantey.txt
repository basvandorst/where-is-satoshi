You mean the private key is imported with public key that easy? or this is just importing the public key?
That's frightening. If it is so easy to import the keys from your wallets from for third party, then this is very dangerous to use any mobile wallet.
I have Android &amp; Mycellium. Is there a high probability that some malicious app will just copy my private keys?

in ZapChain rewards aren't solely granted to the best answer. And you can't get full reward if you won in the answer. And I am personally see ZapChain as overcomplicated - the whole name of zapchain sounds too difficult, also I still can't have clear picture on how to use ZapChain or how it works, even though I used it 3 times previously. Moreover ZapChain (as the name says it) is designed for cryptocurrency-related Questions. While this service seem to be very easy! This is groundbreaking. I'll definitely give it a try. I've been waiting for such easy service for a very long time.

Poor guy, probably wakes up in the middle of the night with the subj words. Then in the middle of work he logs on to IRC channel to ping like "Are blocks full?".
Be honest to me "Are blocks full?". 
Are blocks full? 
Are blocks fucking full?!?!

https version doesn't work (you specified https in medium article, I think its better to fix it just to coinmap.org) :( Chrome, Windows XP, correct date/time. HTTP version works pretty good.
Also I can't find how to add places.

Best way to do it is the opposite way. Take a loan from them (become a friend to a merchant if needed, for any amount). Then when the day will come to return money, notify them that you can pay only Bitcoins and nothing else :P Happy downvoting
