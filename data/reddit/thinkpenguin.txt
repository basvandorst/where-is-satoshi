It's much less expensive than perceived. 20% of the cost (what is paid on arrival) would merely have been collected by the European company who sold you the part/system instead of it being collected on delivery. In reality it's nothing more than the cost of shipping which varies from country to country (where Europe is concerned). 
Depending on the laptop/computer from the US to UK: $50-$65 USD. This is less than going UPS ground to many places in the United States.
All that said ThinkPenguin has shipping options for most of the items in its catalog from both the US &amp; UK. Ultimately the costs are slightly more for us shipping from the UK and the only reason it might seem better to people in Europe right now is because we 'eat' the higher costs of doing business in that region. In the future we might eat more of the cost too than we do now to kill this perception of higher prices because we are a US company. It has nothing to do with that. If it was reflecting reality the prices for European customers would naturally be much higher (20% minimally due to taxes). This change may come shortly as we will be putting up a new web site which better supports customers outside the United States (added currencies, languages, regional configurations, etc).

That is unlikely. HP has been implementing digital restrictions in the BIOS that prevent users from replacing the wifi card. Unless it ships with an Atheros 802.11N wireless card you'll probably have problems.

It really shouldn't be too surprising that it reads like a story about BitPay. The press release was a joint effort between BitPay &amp; ThinkPenguin. It's also the first press release we (ThinkPenguin, inc) have done. ThinkPenguin's still a pretty small operation and so is BitPay. There aren't more than a few dozen people between the two companies.
You have to remember that this centralizing is also a necessary right now. There simply aren't enough users to warrant thousands of exchanges nor are there enough businesses accepting it. Anything that makes it a two click simple solution to accepting BitCoins is a good thing. 
Better solutions and more entities to do exchanges will come along. However it takes time for that to happen. Until then your best bet as a business wanting to accept it (and have lots of customers paying with it) is to get on board with companies like BitPay.
We will work on better integration of BitCoins down the road. We may offer a different BitCoin address for each transaction to improve anonymity (though, your ultimately going to have to surrender a shipping address in most instances with the type of business we operate) and drop that from our database after shipment/or maybe 30-60 days later (so we can deal with shipping issues that might arise), followed by support for seeing products and services advertised in BTC (as opposed to USD currently). 
I also will point out that we have bought goods/services in BitCoins ourselves in addition to accepting them. However there are still very few companies that will accept them. It is unlikely that any distributor or factory is going to be willing to accept BitCoins at this time. It would surprise me if services like BitPay don't accelerate BitCoin's adoption.
