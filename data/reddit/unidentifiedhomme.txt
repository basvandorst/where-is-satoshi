Really?  Sarcasm?  Why not just say yes such sites exist and provide an example or make some other constructive comment such as good or bad features of such sites.

Well, no.  Blockchain is a technology.  It does not have transaction costs except in specific implementations.  I mean, what are the transaction costs for selling / buying / exchanging bitcoin, etherium, litecoin, raiblocks, etc.?  And how do the transaction costs vary from day to day?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:04:15
Is there a site where typical transaction costs are tracked and reported?  Including historical information?

Well, it seems you have confirmed:
* this is not a practical use of bitcoins 
** confirmation takes time (6 confirmations give "us" high confidence, but they are not technically irreversible)
** small transactions are not practical with bitcoin, despite the claims (by others, not you, yet) that crypto will take over
* the claim there is no need to trust another party is highly qualified
* double spend is a risk in point of sale transactions
* The "second layer on top of bitcoin" takes away the anonymity and "no need to trust" features of crypto.  Why use bitcoin when losing those features?  
I disagree that bitcoin transactions are better than traditional transactions because of the time required for confirmation in a traditional transaction.  Confirmation for traditional transactions is immediate; with immediate protection for both parties according to rules. There is no protection for double spend!
Crypto Confirmation takes place in an hour only when the fee is large enough to get it on the block quickly (fee?! gee, I thought crypto was supposed to have low transaction costs!).

As the rider steps out of the bus, how quickly can a payment in bitcoin be confirmed as valid?  Is it not possible for orphan blocks to cause voided transactions?

Thank you for your detailed comments.  I appreciate the civil tone you use.  I am highly skeptical of the value of cryptocurrencies.  I believe the markets for crypto's and more-so the inflated prices reflect irrational psychological truths about people having nothing to do with underlying economic value.  They are great examples of the irrational behavior which is part of behavioral economics rather than classic (rational) economics.  I don't believe all behavioral economics is irrational.  
As an aside, let me assure you I recognize blockchain is a technology of great potential value and well worthy of investment.  
Coinmarketcap does a nice job summarizing some metrics across all crypto's.  Are you aware of a site which attempts to compare crypto's on the basis of other characteristics?  So many are obviously personal get-rick-quick schemes.  Acceptance by large merchants would be one such characteristics; others might be the number of miners and the number of miners operating for more than, say, one year.
Again, thank you for your civil tone.

Your comment that the fees you paid for two stock trades on Vanguard costing you so much makes no sense.

Don't assume the government is bloated just because talking heads tell you that on TV.  Get involved; look at the actual spending; Social Security and Medicare have about $3 Trillion in the Trust Funds, but that money was given away in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.  The DoD spends 24% of the budget; interest eats 6%; if we didn't give so much away in tax cuts for the rich, the interest payment would go away or go down.  We had a surplus at the end of Clinton; Bush and Republicans gave away 100s of billions in tax cuts for the rich; Trump and Republicans just did that again, with Trillion dollar deficits in the budget as far as we can see.

No taxes on physical assets (jewelry, cars, etc.) unless sold for more than paid.
