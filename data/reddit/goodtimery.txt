Bitshares - the longest ongoing scam in the cryptocurrency realm.
First they issued Protoshares to raise money. Then they received thousands of Bitcoins plus large amounts of Protoshares as donations for Bitshares. While the developers then were seriously claiming to 'work for free' they secretely developed proprietary software behind the back of their userbase/investors.
In the spirit of cryptocurrency scams: Sorry for your loss!
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:25:24
Yes in a country like Zimbabwe where tech literacy and smart phones are abundant Bitcoin would be the perfect medium of exchange!

Lets hope that some day Bitcoin will have 44 Megabyte blocks. 
Their scared, numerology driven minds will be frightened.

Now tell us, exactly which part of environmentalism is idiotic?
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:03:06
No, you are wrong:
[ 'the developers have stopped working for free...' ]( 
I don't know why you say things that are simply not true. Sorry but the Larimers seem to be professional fraudsters and they are good at their job. The fact that people like you STILL give them money after they have already made millions is highly entertaining to observe.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:29:30
So Bitcoin will choose 8 megabyte because archaic, superstitious Chinese believe this magic wonder number will bring them luck and wealth? So much for decentralization. I propose 4 megabyte just to make their superstitious minds bathe in fear and terror. 
If you wanted to fight against the centralization of Chinese mining now is your chance: 4 megabyte blocksize!

Are there any sources for the often cited amount of 400K BTC? I'd be genuinely interested
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:40:04
It is not convincing that you would not care who Satoshi is.
Considering the fact, that you spend a major amount of your time working with the fascinating system he created, it is only logical that you are interested in all the other thoughts it's creator might have.
I think I will stop to dig here, because the general evasiveness concerning Mr Szabo from people who have met him is perhaps the most conclusive of clues.

This is an excellent representation of the typical XT node operator and the depth of the contemplations involved. Thank you for this unintentional display of self-imposed nonage!

Welcome to Reddit nullc!
Thanks for the suggestion but I choose my interests myself.
It is interesting that you are claiming to be omnisciently aware of other peoples' consciousness ('most people haven't noticed') despite all the evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:50:46
You da real MVP
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:44:31
The problem is that Bitcoin is highly complex and requires a deep understanding of many different areas and the typical user simply does not have the necessary qualifications to make any reasonable decision in this case.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:51:16
Relax buddy, it's a joke. And a pretty good one I must say, made me laugh!

Edit: I really don't know where the huge discrepencies between different sites come from. Generally I presume the largest value to be the most accurate. Well connected nodes can better assess these changes.

I wouldn't be surprised if they created the majority of those wallets themselves.

Probably the same thing that happened with practically all crypto-crowdfunded schemes. Some people never learn.

Yeah this is now the third day in row of this attack ('Stress Test') - currently over 60000 unconfirmed transactions.
It will be interesting to see how developers tackle this problem, as it seems to cripple Bitcoin more and more.

[Stress Test](
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:45:57
No, everything is looking normal. Mempool at 3.5Mb and 1.5 tx/s. 
Another, more intense stress test would be nice though.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:59:55
Hey Mr would you mind explaining the test and your motivations for it a little bit? I think a lot of people would be interested.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:33:30
And Bitcointalk. And the Blockchain. And your unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:38:24
B..B..But developer said most people would not notice this spam attack.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:30:29
That is insane. What measures are the developers working on to improve this situation in the near future? It is rather quiet from their side.
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:32:45
And there are already 33000 transactions waiting to be confirmed. This will be a nuisance for a lot of people
Edit: already 47000 unconfirmed transactions and climbing

Holy Mother of God, you are right. But the article speaks about a woman. Either it's Dorian's daughter or Satoshi is female!

It's so strange just how many of the people that got early into and wealthy through Bitcoin have a dubious/criminal past.

@_date: 2015-07-08 11:09:19
Unfortunately they don't seem to communitcate.
Yesterday presumably one of them posted private keys to addresses used in the attack that still had Bitcoins in them (in many small outputs though). He/she did not provide further information.
See [Here]( and [Here](
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:01:53
I think we can all be certain that by now at least one developer is working for a three letter agency. 
We have Mike, with his questionable history and military way of speeking. 
And we have Gavin who has met with the CIA and who has maybe a bit too often been close to trouble but miraculously always managed to escape such situations unaffected.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:29:07
Sadly sheep typically don't realize that they are being led. What the 'users want' is in this case something that was suggested to them via clever rhetoric and manipulative tactics. 
People use Bitcoin because it provides a valuable service, not because they are waiting for technical features they have only avague understanding of to be implemented. XT could start on it's own chain without a hardfork to test your claim that users will 'stop using it in prefence of something else'.
The fact that Gavin and Mike have chosen the destructive route of a hardfork implies everything users need to know about their motives.

You seem to willingly ignore that this would be a forking 'patch' leading to hand over the control of the code base of the resulting XT branch to two people.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:30:47
You can set it in your client, but you would need to create a new transaction.
Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2015-09-29 11:15:43
You mean addresses. No there is no address with this amount.
A wallet can contain any number of addresses and nobody knows which addresses are part of a wallet and where this wallet resides, as that would pretty much make Bitcoin useless.
Edit: Here you can check out [the richest addresses]( and search for potential candidates

Is Bitreserve exchanging 'Bit' for 'Fractional'? We can't be certain yet, but the signs are there. I would definitely warn against using their service for now

Yes definitely possible. Then again it is so unlikely that you could argue that for all practical means it is impossible.
There are 2^160 possible addresses.

@_date: 2015-09-02 13:13:46
Look up the meaning of irony again, please.
Coinwallet is attacking the network with this spam to create artificial necessity for a premature implementation of larger blocks. Do you want to be part in this attack against Bitcoin? Because that is what you do if you support XT alongside these dubious spammers and shills.
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:16:31
You are wrong. My last commit was for Quantlib.
But I don't expect you to actually care for facts. Simply accusing me with unsubstantiated nonsense is a lot easier, am I right?

Mike, that sounds suspiciously like a perfect description of what you are doing to Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:39:12
They create artificial necessity for larger blocks and unsurprisingly made it no secret that they support XT. But yes, please go on and try to twist it to fit your dubious agenda.
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:32:57
That is going to be an unfair contest

Sure, [here you go](
Tradeblock's mempool is currently at 156 MB
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:40:48
It is not simply an alternative implementation
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:28:39
Coinwallet.eu is spamming the network by sending out a large number of transactions that are small in value but large in size.
They do this to cause stress and to create the illusion that Bitcoin would urgently need a larger block size.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:30:48
These hackers seem astonishingly competent
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:37:03
This is just one aspect of a multifacetted issue, a very complex problem. The limit has partly been established as a way to control spam and in a way the attacker has to outbid the whole network for fees. Yes raising the block size would make this attack more expensive, BUT would also increase bandwidth requirements, reduce decentralization, decrease Bitcoin's security and allow for other attacks. 
Bitcoin is the first real decentralized payment network, of course it is not perfect but giving up it's core principles to create another VISA is idiotic. If XT people want to have a benevolent dictator they don't have to look far because VISA etc are already there.
Scepticism should be introduced through the mere fact that those who attack the network (Coinwallet.eu) are also those who want larger blocks (XT)
@_date: 2015-11-02 12:37:38
So why are you still here?
@_date: 2015-03-25 09:38:34
It may come as a surprise as one first discovers that the intelligence level in the Bitcoin sphere is not as highly situated as one might have expected.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:34:25
Officially a paid shill! Congratulations!
@_date: 2015-10-31 10:28:43
I agree. This guy also controls somewhat too much of Bitcoin. 
Estimated 300,000 BTC, blockchain.com, bitcoin.com and a lot of others. It is not good for a decentralised system to have one person with such large ownership / control.
