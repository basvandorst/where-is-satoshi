I feel like if the DOW or some regulated stock dipped and recovered this much in less than a day, the feds would be investigating.  It's very shady.  There should be a legit explanation; this shouldn't just be brushed off as a fluke or rare occurrence.  That being said using a form of trade not regulated by a governing body is a double edged sword.

I'm having a hard time reconciling the math on this.  I heard recently that cryptocurrency hit 0.1% of global market/currency at $250bn.  Quick maths would mean global money is capped at $2.5tn.  So, the debt is almost ten times the global market cap?

That's not mining; that's trading a service for a commodity. But I know what you mean.  There was a pic on reddit a few weeks ago of kids with a lemonade stand that accepted Bitcoin.

When you borrow $100 from someone, it's your problem/responsibility to pay it back.  When you borrow $233 trillion, it's their problem.

That's like stories I've heard of people bringing a barrel full of money to the grocery store just for a loaf of bread.  Hyperinflation is scary as hell.

So, I've been reading on here to hold out to weather the storm of fluctuations but am now reading how we should dump one specific wallet solution.  I'm weary of completely jumping ship from a vendor over an incident I know little about. Is there something other than running out the door and making quick efforts to move my coin to another wallet?

Here's a dumb question.  If the dollar collapses, and most public debt is measured/regulated in the dollar, how does that affect the debts?  Would they just be replaced/converted into whichever other currency the banks choose?
Edit: grammar

I was intentionally asking a loaded question.  Back in the day, a college degree was a guaranteed good job/job placement.  But more recently it seems there's more of a demand for trade skills.

Isn't spending a bunch of money on a college degree a gamble?

If you paid taxes in cash and the dollar inflated/deflated, would you then owe more? I don't think so. Probably an r/asklegal question.

That's why trade agreements exist and how sales can reach major milestones.  You don't have to like someone to make a trade with them.
