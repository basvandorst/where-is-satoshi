One of the reasons that they lack money because they're getting f*cked in the butt by fees at every turn, including by the check cashing businesses. 
It can be expensive to be poor.

Thank you very much for sharing this. 
I feel obligated to ask you or anyone else here - was this quality about what you expected for paying $700? I'm just curious because I'm looking into outsourcing stuff in the near future... using bitcoin of course.

I work on a small team and using 1password over dropbox has been extremely useful. This allows for one person push a password to the database only one time and have it available for anyone to pull at anytime.
The other password managers relied on manual back-and-forth pushing of credentials directly to other people. Very annoying when working with a large set of passwords that are always randomly generated.

I'm glad that I saw this thread before trying to use Mycelium. I wouldn't have thought much of the update request and went forward with it. 
That being said, I already had backups.  Still scary though.

I don't really get slammed with waves of nostalgia, but that did the trick.

It's a call-to-action. I agree that it is sometimes annoying, but big data shows that this technique is very effective. The trend has been going strong for at least 6 years.
