A week ago, Mt. Gox claimed their closing trades was due to a bug in the Bitcoin protocol. Kilorat is making a joke saying that the reason the website won't load is because there's a bug in the HTTPS (the protocol used to load secure webpages) protocol. :~}

Kinda hard to match a font that doesn't exist; it's a handwritten comic

I understand the received time is today, and I don't understand why. The TX wasn't showing up in the blockchain until today, even though it was initiated from my wallet 3 weeks ago.

On the bright side, at least they take security important. They paid me a $1,000 bounty for reporting a pretty serious bug, and their communication and resolution was quick &amp; prompt.

I just want to say that, assuming everything you wrote is correct, this is a beautiful response and has clarified so many things for me that a ton of ELI5s and searches on this subreddit haven't been easy to understand about. Thank you!

I, too, have purchased from BFL, and understand where the skepticism may come from. That said, aside from the sketchy delays of shipping, I still have a rather optimistic outlook about the entire thing. AFAIK they've been helpful on their support forum, and they've provided video evidence and sent out working prototypes to different journalists. This proved a lot of people who claimed they didn't even exist wrong, which helped renewed my faith that they will deliver. Whether it's tomorrow, or a year from now, I'm hopeful that they'll deliver. 
I guess my question to you is, do you believe that they could turn around and get their act together? If they started provided much faster refunds to everybody, had more frequent updates and newsletters, and possibly shipped more units more often, would you have a different opinion of them?

I know, and I'm sure they'll keep bullshitting us and delaying it for a couple more months, but I'm just curious what if. Like, in a hypothetical situation.

I know! By the time I finished reading all 40 some pages I felt like I would scream if I had to read "based on my training and experience" or "my experience and training shows ...." one more time! &gt;:{

This is correct. They aren't hosting the actual website, but all traffic passed to that website is tunneled through Cloudflare. While this is typically used to prevent DDoS attacks and load balance, malicious users sometimes use it to hide where their actual website is hosted,  thus making it harder for people to submit a complaint.
I don't know Cloudflare's policies on phishing, but Cloudflare has hosted (and refused to take down) questionable websites in the past, including hacking group Lulzsec. They actually have an article about it, here:

If BFL shipped, I feel like everybody's perspective on them would be totally different.
Am I mistaken?

I agree that if they try, they will more than likely fail at "destroying" or regulating Bitcoin. Though, I can see them trying. A single government attack (seizure) on Mt. Gox would certainly send a lot of Bitcoin users into disarray.
