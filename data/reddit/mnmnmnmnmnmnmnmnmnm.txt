I still don't understand why people think Visa = credit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:47:56
People think of the "thing" they are interacting with essentially as the company they have to interact with. To get a credit card, most people go to Visa, and think of Visa (or one of a handful of companies). To get bitcoin, people go to exchanges (one of a handful). If all of your exchanges are shit, they are going to think bitcoin is shit, since this is the way they have to acquire the stuff - just like if Visa was shit, people would think credit cards are shit, as that is the way they have to acquire a credit card.

Be honest, how euphoric are you right now?
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:47:24
Stoner logic?

No it isn't. Putting your money where your mouth is means learning basic programming, learning a little math, and then 


by creating a service that does this.


I believe you. You're a captain of industry who plans to get rich off of other people's work, just like all the captains of industry who came before you, right? They never actually did anything useful to acquire their wealth. They just bought autism pennies and became rich somehow. Without work.
You'd fit right in on Wall Street, if only the people on Wall Street didn't work and provide some kind of service or additional value for others which made them rich and in demand. EDIT: And your username is fucking LOLworthy due to its accuracy.

Buy pork or chicken pre-cooked any time recently, like at a restaurant? Both could actually kill you if not handled properly.
Fish? Mercury is a miracle food.
How about gasoline at a pump?
Your car? Any other transportation you use?
Get sick any time and get prescribed medication? Why be forced to actually prove medication works, or is safe, when you could just claim it is and make a fortune off of desperate sick people.
Buy anything with paint on it? Lead is pretty awesome. Great for the digestive tract.
You buy plenty of dangerous or potentially-dangerous products, you just get to enjoy the luxury of regulated markets to make sure they don't get you killed without your knowledge.

And every time you guys say stuff like this, you lose more people from your cause. "Give it time." lol, no one's ever heard THAT before. "Oh but bitcoin is new." No, it's been around for years. "XYZ thing will happen because it has to for this to work." Well, plenty of things have never happened even though they were supposed to.
If you really believed in it, you'd put your money where your mouth is and make things happen. If it's really a sure thing, you'd make a killing off of putting a little footwork in now.
But you won't. And you know why.

See, you don't even get why it won't ever do that. You live in a fantasy world. It needs a billion problems fixed, and, afaik, no one is fixing them. Mostly in the economics of the whole thing, but no economists will ever take this stuff seriously because it isn't even possible to make this thing do what you want it to do.
Will it gain mass adoption? No, and probably never, for reasons too numerous to count, and completely ignored by everyone in the community. And that is why you're all wasting your time.
But do enjoy your wasted time, by all means.

So you are implementing a new security feature for bitcoin users? Because that's what I meant and thought it was pretty obvious from the context of the entire discussion.
If you aren't developing something like that, then you aren't passing the test, and we all know from your previous statements (and the subsequent context) that you aren't.
I don't mean improving YOUR security, lol, that doesn't even matter in the long run. I am talking about the ennui evident in the bitcoin development world.

No, I have to disagree. There are a lot of stupid questions. Yours was one of them.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:53:11
You can't actually be this stupid.
