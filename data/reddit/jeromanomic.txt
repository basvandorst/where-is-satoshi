okay so the network is no longer viable to small miners hence the centralization of mining and prices won't be forced they'll be implemented.  The choice will be wait hours for a small time freebie to get picked up or pay to go through right away.
It's all a mute point really..  The next generation of cryptocurrencies will displace bitcoin entirely so a whole new system will emerge.

You agree there is no intrinsic value so what is stopping the price from going to zero?
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:57:50
which raises another question... if we assume that like all non-profit companies, these cloud miners are in business with the intention of maximizing profits... then why would they sell us the opportunity to mine if they can make money doing it themselves... the answer is that they price their service in a way so that it is more profitable than mining directly.

 understanding of bitcoin, right no bull scream to the moon. Bears scream whatever fud. However the price should be secondary to the utility bitcoin will provide to society. 


So you see it as an intermediary transaction system not something to invest in.   That's a good point.  The price could be 1 cent and it could still provide the same transaction service.

Oh that's right, there's no money to made... you have to spend thousands to buy special hardware, then your returns don't even cover the electric bill, and after a few months, you need new hardware because the system you bought can't handle the new difficulty :)  
Under those conditions you are right, fees will fall specially when the reward rate halves again...

@_date: 2014-12-12 01:35:35
What exchange are you using?  The price today is in the same band, and is currently below yesterdays close....
if, as you say it is a certainty that fiat will fall in value, how do you overcome the truth that Bitcoin satisfies the definition of fiat, so by your prediction it is a certainty that bitcoin will halve in value, which by the way would be an improvement to the 2014 performance.
Contrary to what you may read in the insulated online world, fiat  does not mean government issued,  it means 'something which has value assigned to it by consensus but has no asset backing'.  Bitcoin is a Fiat currency
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:21:21
The fixed supply has been known since the inception of bitcoin, yet it's down 61.4% over the last year and down 2.5% since yesterday.  Are you sure it's a 'fantastic store of value'?
Shoudn't this magical fixed supply protect the devaluation of bitcoin?  When is the last time your bank account lost 2 thirds of its value in one year?  
It's interesting that you refer to gold... if the price of gold fell to zero, you'd still have a bunch of shiny metal, maybe you could't sell it, but you could find a way to use it.
if the price of bitcoin fell to zero, what would you have?
Bitcoin has no backing and believe it or not, satisfies the definition of fiat, which originated from the term 'because we say so'.   
If the last bitcoin is mined, there is still an uncapped supply of alt coins.  What is limiting their ability to 'mine' coins, which apart from the name, are identical to bitcoin? 
If Toyota decides to only produce 1,000 cars, do you think the price of their cars will go up, or do you think people will just go buy a Honda? 
So how exactly does the limited supply protect the value of bitcoin, and why has it not done so over the past 12 months?

Here is an article I read yesterday about difficulty 
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:23:00
'this time is different'... nobody has every said that before in a bubble
what I would like to know, is why you care about the price of Bitcoin.  The value is 1 Bitcoin, why do you care what the exchange is to the paper currency you seek to bypass?  
You care because Bitcoin has no function as Bitcoin...  it's only utility is as a transaction based intermediary.  
You may think that Dell accepts Bitcoin, but they do not.  Through coinbase, they are allowing you to pay them in US Dollars when you sell Bitcoin...  Their prices are in US Dollars and they have never received a single Satoshi, nor do they intend to.
When companies start accepting bitcoin and setting prices in bitcoin, you'll have a medium of exchange, until then, all you have is a way for companies market their products to people who would rather sell Bitcoin then pay in cash.
you make reference to the fixed supply as if it has magical powers, you have completely overlooked the problem that there is no intrinsic value... 
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:30:28
Good point. It has speculative pricing based on hype so this fall is part of the adjustment to fair value

Bitcoin gave us a great foundation but for what ever reason, the general population is not using it as a currency and given the average trade volume of $7.8 Million USD per day, it's not making much noise in the forex world...

It once again draws attention to the ironic fact that Bitcoin is a perfect vehicle for con artists... If I deal with a dodgy merchant and pay with dollars, there are consumer protection mechanisms in place to help me get my money back.  If I pay in Bitcoin, the money is simply gone...
It is a major issue which Bitcoin needs to overcome if it wants to be taken seriously in the mainstream
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:15:47
It's not about a collapse of the system... nobody wins from that.  I think that mining has accelerated too quickly. 
 We have deviated from the spirit of Bitcoin.  The original Bitcoin paper released by Satoshi stated 'We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust'
We are now in a position of trusting these large miners...  yes they do process zero fee transactions and yes there are still individual miners, but there is an undeniable centralization of mining.
I think that during the boom times mining grew too fast.  I don't believe it was ever intended for there to be specialist mining companies.  It has caused synthetic growth in the hashrate and grown the difficulty to  a level where home based miners can no longer make a significant contribution.
As you say, the block reward is no longer profitable, so mining for fees is the only way for mining to be worthwhile... this is precisely what bothers me.   Yes you can transact for free today, but the question is for how long.  
In a decentralized system, competition would ensure that fees remain low.  In an oligopoly, that is not usually the case....
I live in a country were four major players dominate the banking system.  They are hugely profitable and while they do not actively collude (at least to my knowledge).  There is evidence of unspoken collusion.  
For example the banks charge $2 if you use an atm which is not on their network.  It's a  big profit maker for the banks, and they all charge it.    It is an optional fee because I have managed to find an account which does not charge the fee (but I have to deposit at least $2,000 per month)
This is the type of behaviour I envision emerging down the track.  The big mining companies will start putting in place fees to keep themselves profitable.  It will be possible to circumvent them, but most people either won't know how to get around them, or it will be an inconvenience so most will just pay it...

Yes Gold had value as soon as it was discovered.  People were attracted to the shiny metal, and the fact that it was difficult to find, gave it instant intrinsic value.
What properties of bitcoin add value?  It doesn't even exist in the physical world....  There is nothing about bitcoin that can not be replicated by an alt coin.

But then the small miners will run at a loss as they do now.  With power bills and set up costs etc
My bank may not charge me fees but if I take out a loan they're going to make interest.  And they are making an interest profit by lending out my savings
Unfortunately when the reward dwindles the only incentive left is fees.  This point was conceded in the original Satoshi paper

Unless I skipped something, there is nothing in the article about monopolizing mining for fees...  it's about centralization of mining. 
 If you click the pie chart in the article, it takes you to todays hashrate stats, you will see  discuss fish represents 26%, ghash 16% antpool 10%... so three miners represent 52% of your 'decentralized system'...

You pay them based on the Monday morning exchange rate?  How is this different from paying them in dollars? You know they are cashing out right ?
The invoicing side is interesting. you set the price based on the exchange rate.  So customers have to use coinbase to pay you the USD prices?
Let me guess, if you set a price in BTC and the rate falls, they always pay the BTC amount, and you absorb the USD loss in USD revenue. 
If the rate rises they complain, so you issue a new invoice at correct USD value for less BTC. 
You can't underpay staff in USD terms and can't overcharge customers in USD terms. So essentially you are creating and absorbing unnecessary exchange rate risk to yourself 
Not trying to make fun of you, just trying to understand where is the upside for you?  As you say your expenses and prices depend on the fiat so how is this 'using' Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:09:32
Fiat currencies don't need intrinsic value, they are medium of exchange.
There function is to provide a measure of value which we all recognize and understand.  It gives us the ability to assign prices to goods and services, and trade in these paper credits rather than have to rely on barter...
Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange yet.  when people use it for transfers, all they are doing is moving from one fiat to another.  So what if they don't charge fees, all that means is that they are making no money from it.
Vodafone is already providing low cost transfers within and between over 100 countries.  They are doing it all with standard fiat currencies, and they have a market of almost $2 Billion per month
Bitcoin facilitates one little transfer for $200 from US to China, and everyone gets excited...

Western Union provides a services, and charges a fee.  This enables them to turn a profit.  I have not invested in Western Union, nor would I.  The value in Western Union is that they are generating profits.
Bitcoin may be able to facilitate a similar service, but if it is not charging for the service, then it is not generating any financial value for itself.  It's all well and good to be charitable and give things away, but let's not pretend that this makes it a good investment...

You are correct that if you use Bitcoin to purchase from a merchant than you are most likely comtributing to downward price pressure.
If it weren't for this instant conversion to cash Microsoft wouldn't be accepting Bitcoin.
If you want to see Bitcoin evolve into a medium of exchange and challenge fiat currency then you have to use it, but if you use it, it goes down in value... so what is the answer?  Maybe it needs to fall in value before it increases in use

What is Bitcoin? It is a digital alternate to money 
How can you use it?   This is something that you can research offline.   Over the next few days, every time you use money, either in the form of cash, card, or credit, ask them if they accept Bitcoin. 
Every time someone says 'yes we take Bitcoin ' you've found a new way to use it.  By doing thus you will find something nice to buy with that 21 cents you just got, but you better hurry cause in about an hour it will be worth 15 cents
That's how I learned to use Bitcoin and I think all new adopters should apply this same method of discovering the disruptive power of Bitcoin

Increased fees is the only answer also we are already seeing centralization of mining which will continue.
Small players will be unable to turn profits so only larger mining companies will survive

Not familiar with geosites but this one is from Squarespace.
People who can't write code build their own site with them.  It suits sites like this (glorified blog or simple shop etc)  They claim to have a developer mode but reviews of it are not good.

A lot of small shop owners have to pass on the Visa / MC charges (around 2.5%).  If they can't do this, then they might not be able to accept cards at all, or find a payment system which doesn't have such high surcharges....

I've known about plus500 for more than a year and I remember looking at their BTC CFD but the bid/offer spread seemed a little steep so I didn't look further.
You could make some  $ trading it if you get the direction right and there is some price movement going on

sounds like they are  just another vendor set up to instantly sell any BTC for cash.  
Not sure how fast they can sell if all they are getting is a penny at a time, but I guess if enough people per day send a penny, maybe they can cash out a few dollars a day.

as an example I shorted some yesterday at $2,054.  That trade has been charged interest twice ( I think it's based on midnight London time).  But it's ahead over $850 even after those costs..  I have an automatic close if the price starts recovering, so if that happens I'll walk away around $500 better off, and if the price keeps falling, I keep moving the automatic close price down with it.

The difference is they were waiting for it to drop, whereas we are watching it drop.... and the holding costs aren't that bad interest rates are pretty low....
