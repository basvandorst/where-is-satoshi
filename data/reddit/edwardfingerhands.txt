I have not ever been banned for breaking a TOS, but I have filed many charge disputes. The only relevant question was whether I received what I paid for.
Come now, do you really think that a company can just keep your money because you broke their 'rules'?

Terms of Service cover the 'Terms' under which 'Service' is provided. She no longer wants the service and so they do not apply. In any case, no TOS gives anyone the right to arbitrarily take your money no matter what they tell you.
A charge does not have to be fraudulent to be disputed, it just has to be disputed. She has no need to lie to anyone.

They can deny the service if they like but they may not keep the money she paid for it.

you got screwed then.

She did not get what she paid for. She received zero online poker service.
A TOS is not some magical document where you can write whatever you want and magically become exempt from consumer law. 
Seriously, try banning someone from a paid for service and not doing a pro-rata refund and see how well that works out for you.

I would dispute the charges immediately. They have zero grounds to pursue you legally or to keep your deposit. They can write anything they want in a TOS but it doesn't make it legal for them to steal your money. I would further remind them that Barratry is a crime in many jurisdictions.

Have you?

Glad to hear you got your money back. We shall have to agree to disagree about the rest.

Irrelevant. She didn't get what she paid for so her money must be refunded.
Breaking a TOS means the provider can refuse to provide you with service. It does NOT mean they can keep the money you paid for it.
