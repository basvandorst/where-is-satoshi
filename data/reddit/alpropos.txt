even if he set up pin first it wouldn't matter.
The seed is not replaced so the hacker doesn't even have to input any pins, even if you'd set up a 1000 pins.
A seed bypasses all this stuff, because its meant as a last resort recovery phase. 
The only way he could prevent acces is by setting up a new seed completely (the original seed will no longer work)
It's so frustrating because this could have been prevented so easely if the victim actually bothered to search up on hardware wallets for less then just 10 minutes.
And a shame too

Did you lose money? no you didn't.
For fucks sake dude, tell people to calm down when they are losing money and all you have on the line is your goddamn profits.
This doens't compare to anything, 
Days have changes, bitcoin was no longer about its internal value the moment people sheered for all the hype back in November.
ALL OF YOU ASKED FOR THIS YOURSELVES, you wanted people to get in so you could hopefully see that value pump into the crazy value (And getting rich of of them right at it)
People laugh at others who call this a ponzey cheme.
But right now, it has all the factors for a new investor to believe it
This is VERRY damaging for the cryptocurrency space
This is just frustrating and annoying, it doesnt compare to recent events and years and the results of this will probably dissapoint A LOT of people.

this is the first time since i think 2016 where we witnissed a bear market for longer then a month. (actually we're still not even there yet)

@_date: 2018-01-16 22:37:45
the real story? yet you don't mention the fact that an exchange holding well over 80% of all the mined bitcoins was hacked.
Verry different reason as to why we have today's decline,
Also a verry different reason because skeptism was based on other reasons (security) where now it's just general fud (goverment bans / alt competition / btc scaling problems)
We might see a new ATH this month if we go by last year's standards. But i'm not an optimist, i know there's much more going on right now.
But none of this relates even close to the downfall in 2013 and it's 2 year recovery that followed with it.
Will it be worse? maybe, but thats a different topic
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:09:12
makes perfect sense, futures ended a few days ago, most of the dumping took place on the days before that.
I don't see any reason why people would dump today, infact there is much more reason to get in again (assuming they sold previously) because there is high anticipation for a bull run to start within the next weeks.
- More clarity concerning FUD topics
- More news announced that will result in chances towards increasing adotion
- New future contracs going bullish for the most part
- New exchanges offering various coins
- Increased progressions on LN network

Gdax charges 0.25% fee on MARKET buy/sell orders. (wich is still a tiny fraction compared to buying on Coinbase itself)
But if you place limit orders (has to be 0.01 min = downside for some people) you don't any fee at all. 
Withdrawals or transferering your coins from gdax is also free.
Also, stop buying on coinbase and either use gdax (don't need a different account) or switch exchanges entirely.

The exact same impatience you're stating by requesting things to be fixed NOW.
We could apply short term solutions like the blocksize increase on BCH, but that would just lead to a new problem in a matter of years. 
Bitcoin core aims to adress these issues at the same time, while fixing the current issues. They aim for long term improvements, but that takes time.

There's people complaining left &amp; right unable to verify accounts, you'd figure demand would increase 10 fold, and the price should too because it did so a shit ton BEFORE it was even any sort of mainstream like today. yet the price keeps hovering at 15k for nearly 2 weeks while it would have been up to 20 otherwise.

Same skepticism here. Wich is why i'm debating if i should cash out my profits. I almost doubled my investment, and my profits right now exceed 20% of my total savings.

the only real "old hodlers" who have a right to speak are those that ENDURED the mt gox crash. 
Everyone else only experienced mini dips in relation to mt. gox and to the dip of this whole entire week (keep in mind we nearly reached a 20k ATH) 
Today is a mere 30% drop compared to yesterday, but it's nearing a 60% drop from our current ATH and its about to even out on last months starting point.
I think this will take a lot longer to recover then just "new year" 
if this volitility keeps up we might not see 15k again by summer. 
The only comforting thing about all of this right now is that i'm still in profits. For people who started investing after the 10k milestone this is a whole different story and you really can't compare it.
I'm pretty damn sure a lot of you self proclaimed "long time hodlers" probably started investing AFTER mt gox, making this entire comparison pointless.

Not only that. 12k is hardly a "high" increase if we consider the past double up's and the time it took to reach it.
Not saying +20% is a huge climb but for bitcoin it's common practise to assume 30% swings hardly mean a thing.

Here's 2 lessons.
ZOOM OUT, even at 7k € drop it would still be up over 10% compared to last month. (10% is a freaking huge deal if we talk investment returns)
People witnissed bigger % wise corrections. 13€ &gt; 11€ is about a mere 15-20% drop (quick maths). Previous corrections exceeded 30-40%. (5.5k to 3k) (3.5 &gt; 2k)
The only people who truely witnissed a downfall in BTC are the ones who endured the MT gox crash. Everything else is like btc being tickled.

I'm still debating on cashing out all and hopefully get in again at a verry good price. or just cash out my original investment and keep the rest rolling. so all of it onward will be pure profit with 0 risk
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:35:17
yes i know, which is why i mentioned the whole coinbase fiasco.

yup, with my profits now exceeding my monthly salary i didn't even wait anymore
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:24
incl my profits it would be at 40% right now.
That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind this 20% equals about 1 month and a half of salary (on my current job)
I saved about 10k, invested 2k into bitcoin and planning to cash out the 2k when it hits 16k and my investment is basicly doubled at that point.
with the recent spikes in BTC i didn't want to miss out, i have a chance to generate well over 10k of profits this way (3/4 year investment) and only lose about a month worth of salary in the worst case scenario when btc would reach 0$. 
Keep in mind that as my savings increase the % of my investments will slowly go down. 
2k on 10k = 20%
2k on 20k = 10% 
I expect to have about 30-40k of savings in 3/4 years excluding my investments right now, wich is why i decided to take a bigger risk and invest more into crypto right now.

Transfering bitcoins from coinbase to GDAX is free.
Converting money to BTC or BTC to money will cost you a fee. but it is insanely small on GDAX. (€200 btc purchase gave me a 0.50€ fee)
BUT, if you use limit sell &amp; buy orders NO FEE IS CHARGED.
If you're afraid of a crash, put a limit sell order.
If you feel a big dip is comming to X$, put buy orders on that amount to buy the dip.
All of this will cost you nothing extra and your actual funds are FULLY converted into BTC or whatever crypto you decide to invest/trade with.
GDAX is underrated
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:44:03
just speculation.
But i like to give credit to wallstreet for who they are, and they're not going to ride this currency to 100k and just have every global citizen ride along to take the profits.
A lot of people bought during the 3k - 10k climb. if we assume the value right now would be 15k it would require a lot of effort to short bitcoin enough that it would pannick the market.
If you bought at 3k and it goes from 15 &gt; 6-7 you're still in good profits so you will most likely hodl and continue the ride.
But if you would short it from 10k &gt; 4k wich is essentially about the same drop, it would have a much larger impact because it would mean profit loss or even investment losses because the price is now way closer to most people's entry level.
They are doing this for big short term gains, with or without it bitcoin will still reach a new ATH anyway. so it's just extra gains this way. 
Adding to this, keeping a high 10k wall is a good way to measure demand. and will probably give them a good idea on their chances to succesfully short bitcoin
Then again, this is all speculation with my tinfoil hat on. 
But i prefer to assume the worst so i don't run into suprises. and I will keep hodling regardless, i don't need the money
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:26

yeah, ofcourse you're going to make that claim if you're hugely invested into this asset yourself.
These crystal 8 ball predictions are getting out of hand
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:11
it went up from 6&gt; 14k only this month. Even if it dropped to 7k most investors are still in profits.
Right now it went down just 2K, this happend a few times over this week and recovered each time
A real correction imo would be a 50%+ drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:52:37
No one knows. that all depends on wallstreets capability to succesfully short bitcoin or not.
If they can short it we could enter a bear market for a while before we see a new ATH. 
If it fails it might aswell just climb 10 fold right from the go.
I also don't want to be the one giving advice if it's good to cash out and lock profits or hodl. it could go both ways.
It could all just play out like our latest correction wich hardly had any influence.
Again, only time will tell

yeah but the result would be the same. I give up BTC for Fiat or another crypto.
With bitcoins climb LTC is climbing aswell (i also own LTC btw)
While more stable, a big crash on BTC will no doubt influence ltc value aswell.
I'll just have to convince myself not to sell and assume it will only get better in the future. 
At least i can comfort myself in the fact that i don't even need this money right now because i can live perfectly fine on my monthly salary right now

those who bought at 3k+ haven't really witnissed a correction like this (August &amp; November was nothing like this)
so I understand where you're comming from. it's easy to reinvest if you're already up 100%+ on your original investments. 
I started at 3k € and made many deposits along the way, my latest being €500 @ 9.75k.  
note that i will not be losing profits untill it drops to ~7.5k, a lot of that is to thank on my early deposits. a good "safety zone" that the majority of new commers who stepped in @ 11-12k+ don't really have right now. 
Emotionally it can really make a difference, especially if there's a lot of money involved.

thats the thing, BTC dips don't really bother me. but last night literally everything went down.

welcome to bitcoin.
You'll get used to it (I started in august, and witnissed 2 corrections with a bigger % drop then what we witnissed this entire week) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:24:37
I think where it went up to 10.9k then dropped all the way to 8.7 in less then a minute, up again to 10.3 in the next.

man, anyone who's been following the big volume trades over the passed week knows this is nothing major. 
It dropped from 9.9k &gt; 8.4 in less then a minute before and it went up just as fast as it dropped.

can you explain this? i see this pop up so many times and i have no idea what it means
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:14
i originally started at 3.7. then made small deposits ranging from 3k to about 5k before i decided to cash out feeling afraid of the segwitt / x2 fud. 
Nothing happend and while i made some fiat profit i ended up losing in bitcoin. 
I redeposited my funds at 5.7k and just added chunks as fast as i could since then. 
My latest deposit was about 25% of my total investment @ 9.5k.
Unless it drops below 7k i'm still in profits.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:12:04
Users that will leave when other exchanges actually offer them better fees.

A lot of long term hodlers are pretty much deciding between staying optimistic for even higher gains or just settle it and set yourself with your current profits.
"Our" own money is not really involved, its just a matter of how greedy you are at this point.

i'm advising everyone i know that has invested into crypto's on coinbase / gdax to store it on ANY other wallet RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.
They can do whatever they want, but i will have my bitcoin with me when the lock that shit up one day. and with recent events i don't think it will take that long anymore
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:45:26
I read something about ripple coins being mostly distributed to miners. the balace is extremely off so how is that any different from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:45:10
I tried this but it's saying the ammount i want to transfer is to low (I did transfers of 0.0001 btc) 
I could try to add more balance to my segwitt adress then transfer it to my legacy. But i'm not sure if this will add fees or not
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:18:30
Futures will come
You can make a contract to buy X btc and you pay the price within X time based on the value of bitcoin on that day.
In general, yes, that means you're betting that it will drop in value.
Why do people make this a big deal?
1) it can secure volitility 
2) its an open gate for wallstreet &amp; bankers to join the bitcoin network
3) because wallstreet probably thinks they can short bitcoin (read: it'll probably fail) to make easy short term money with results leading to a pump in price because the bets they made didn't work out
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:57:14
futures will hopefully reduce volitility on the long run. When that happens it can finally grow to what it is advertised for
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:38:00
mini dip upto 9.7k max if we can assume the value over the passed two days.
My tinfoil hat tells me players are deliberatly holding the price to 10k, probably to have bigger influence shorting bitcoin when futures arrive.
Only time will tell
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:57

I'm thinking of investing €500 into coinbase. Is this a safe place to do it?
I'm new to investing and bitcoin, but this seems like a good start, my plan is to keep it rolling for at least 3 to 4 years (when i will probably move out)
Depending on what happens, i'm willing to invest upto 1.5k more during the coarse.
Some advice would be appreciated.
personally, €500 is a good sum of money to me (about 2 weeks of fulltime work) but i have a good ammount saved up that losing this will not hurt my financial balance. so yeah, i'm willing to "lose" this €500 obviously
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:35
well your $11.000 is worth about 25k right now, congrats!

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:39
This this so much this
I see coinbase hate threads popping up left &amp; right and I have no clue what this sudden outrage is about!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:47:06
how do you go about setting this up.
I have a spare gaming rig doing nothing right now, it's not that new but probably powerfull enough to run a node on it?
How would this effect my download &amp; upload size per month?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:09:53
3000-3500-3600-3900-4600-5500-6000-6800-6900-7600 &amp; will probably buy a huge fucking chunk in a day or two 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:22
they thought bitcoin was established at 50$, then at 100$ then at 500$, then at 1k, so on so on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:10
everyone uses coinbase pretty much
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:57:21
Where is all this hate suddenly comming from? Did i miss something major?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:33
You didn't miss anything. This is exacly the process. 
If you buy 500$ worth of bitcoin and it doubles in value, you made an easy 500$ (not counting fees right now)
You can also transfer your purchased bitcoins to your own personal wallet. This means you actually own the bitcoin yourself, it also means that the exchange network you bought it from can't suddenly claim it back from you for whatever reason.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:36:40
I reinvested my Original sum which i invested at the start without my profit. Maybe you misunderstood.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:21:32
Looks like you already had good wealth if you can invest like that on early stages of bitcoin to be honest.
But all the best to you, and congrats for the serious profits
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:56:58
There will be a dip when coinbase switches to the new fork
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:01:10
because with the upcomming fork my bitcoins will be duplicated into both coins (you get your ammount of bitcoin value duplicated into the new bitcoin 2x blockchain)
Depending on what happens this could lead to additional profits, and the investment i made is money i can afford to lose, i just want it on there as long as i don't need it. 
The reason i cashed out the profit i had was because of the fork i expected a dip, but turned out the other way so i decided to just keep it rolling again and buy again when it raised above 5k
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:58:49
With all the press getting involved lately this could verry well be the case. 
I wouldn't hope on it tho. i might aswell swing arround the 5.5-5.6 (euro) for a while like it did during the 3.5-4k period
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:54:00
because the majority of holders keep their wallets offline. 
The exchange is not an accurate representive of all the bitcoins in trade.
Its the last thing you should look at to be fair
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:06:51
it means holding your coins. It is typed as HODL because of a meme.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:15:30
But Everyone has been recomending it to new users. Hypocrasy at it's finest
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:18:08
so what is different from the other exchanges compared to bitcoin? 
Don't you essentially put trust in them like coinbase?
i'm from EU, so things like "getting payed in bitcoin" is still a far from happening kind of thing. Most responsible people concerning fiat payments would just laugh it off honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:30:13
I started at 3.9. but i managed to get some in at 3.5 &amp; 3 aswell. Cashed out my profits at 6k. redeposited start investment at 5.7.
Lost some bitcoin but gained good fiat money, now I will just hodl and add bits in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:43:50
i just assume most people will eventually read up on the thing they invest in and quickly realise this coin, cryptocurrency, internet money has so much revolutional potential that it will convert their mindset, not into investing alot into bitcoin to make good fiat profits. but to actually own so much bitcoin by the time it becomes the standard, that you end up being filthy rich anyway.
consider that there was a house for sale a while ago for 40btc, back then valued at 6000$. assuming the value keeps climbing like it does you eventually end up spending maybe about 0.x btc for a house. 
People who step into bitcoin right now not only create a chance for good fiat profits incase bitcoin doesnt work out in the long run, they also create a chance to accumulate enough bitcoin to make them rich even if fiat money ends up becomming completely worthless.
Its completely win/win if you believe in the technology of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:43:56
Nothing beats the look on their face when your "crazy lunatic idea" pays off in good wealth that you can show to them followed by the famous "i told you so"
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:44
I wonder if the huge chunk that sold has anything to do with this
Coinbase itself is down to. I hope this isen't something major
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:14:22
right now i care more about fiat money. 
I have less bitcoin invested now, thats true. but that doesnt really matter to me right now
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:02:28
yup, its already happening
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:31:17
mind sharing that worldwide secure trustless distributed financial transaction system?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:03:39
i used credit card payments. I think fees are higher on credit card compared to bank transfer. but transfer can take upto 3 days so you could miss out on grows.
There's also fees when converting your bitcoin back to your €/$ wallet. and fees when finally cashing out your wallet.
I think i ended up losing about 17-20% of my profit if you count up all the fees. but this includes the fee where i redeposited my original investment back into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:43:17
those 49 from Belgium are probably mine 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:56:15
only invest what you can afford to lose. A lot of people seem to forget 2013's crash that nearly lasted over 2 years.
That aside, bitcoin grew a ton the passed months, so today's all time high might just be another milestone after next week.
I started at 3.9k (current all time high back then), then managed to get a good chunk in again when it dipped at 3.5 &amp; 3k. I cashed out at 5k to lock some of my profit, now invested it again just a few hours ago.
All through coinbase, just keep in mind the fees you pay
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:32:14
holy shit dude,
So the transaction back then was actually succesfull but you never recieved the bitcoin? how did this happen or i'm missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:21
This is just quantity bitcoin holders probably ensuring life reteriment funds in fiat, its still the commonly accepted form  of money right now. 10k is a milestone, one that a lot of these holders just dreamed about. it makes perfect sense to add a guaranteed stamp on their money before the real crash kicks in
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:32:22
4% is nothing. This market could drop down 5% easely and rebounce back to break even the same minute.
If you plan on holding for weeks, months, year then right now is good value.
If you want to do daily or weekly trades, i suggest to wait a day or 2 more and see what sentiment the market will really confirm into
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:04:39
peole said this to "weak hands" who sold their shit at 17k with a 10% loss on their investment.
Just a matter of context and perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:50:56

If BTC is one of them? time will tell. I certainly don't believe it will.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:08:30
what makes you believe it will go down again?
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:42:19
While it might not have contributed to today's bullish trend, it certainly prevented another major sell off from happening incase EU completely dissaproved of crypto or announced hard regulations.
But i agree, this alone will not result in the 16k+ bull run people hope for.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:12:55
about to buy another €500 worth of currency this week. 
Will try to get a bit in now, and hopefully a bit at 5k and perhaps 3-2k if we ever get there.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:33:04
I loved how all the technical analysts predicted a fall back to 9k because it dropped yesterday (new flash bears: it did so every sunday over the past 3 weeks) 
This bullrun is proceeding to create a new batch of bottom sellers that will no doubt hate on crypto after the next month

buy the card, use it to mine in your off time, earn it back over time. win win
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:04:58
Not sure. My guess is he took the profit with the expectation that it will drop lower again.
And his sell off is already on its way to being recovered
Meaning he will not get a chance to buy in lower.
Then again, if it's pure for fiat profit it doesn't matter at what price you buy as long as you sell when it's up. so he could rebuy and wait for the 10-11k rally before selling again.
However, if he planned to accumulate more btc he's on his way to seriously fuck himself over because at this rate he'll be forced to buy in again on a higher price.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:14:00
Asian new year actually lasts for over 2 weeks. 
Its not really celebrated in a single day like most other regions/country's.
Tho they probably have 1 day dedicated to parades &amp; fireworks, fairy stuff.
It shouldn't have much impact in term of sell off, the majority of asain new year sell off already happend back in Jan.
in Asia its a common gesture to give red envoloppes with money to your friends and/or relatives), so that money might actually flow back into the crypto space. 
This scenario could already be playing out, explaining the bull run that started 2-3 days ago
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:18:08

@_date: 2018-02-13 00:00:55
It's amazing how much stuff people come up with to convince themselves their TA is still trending towards a bear market.
Meanwhile we keep recovering all the way from 6k with each daily low gradually moving up along with it.
Few more days and FOMO will start to kick in
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:20:43
Looks like they are buying, but with more caution compared to previous days
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:59:35
a lot of big excganges claimed the same thing in the past, look how that turned out
Do you even know how cryptocurrency is stored? how the only most secured way right now is to have it locked on a cold storage device locked away from internet acces?
If you don't hold the crypto yourself you basicly  just payed them money for nothing. 
They could be the fucking bank of america for all i care, the whole point of bitcoin is that you can HOLD IT YOURSELF eliminating the need for 3rd party options like robinhood is representing itself in right now.
But whatever, go ahead, just don't come crying if your funds are suddenly locked up for whatever reason and you have no means to retrieve them.

Tell it to the majority of dec/jan &amp; feb investors who being fucked right now. There's a reason no money is flowing back right now
It's because we've been in a bear market since late december.
Unless you trade the bull traps you're in for a bad time right now
People are waiting on the sidelines to see confirmation. And with each passing day it just gets harder to conclude what the fuck is happening with the price.
Just more reason to stay out.
I don't expect major trend reversal untill half into next month or so. For now it's just gradually down.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:58:54
soo, how many of you sold at 7k expecting it would go sub 6K.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:53:03
Trading looks easy in a bear market, untill it stops and it goes sideways.
Curious how many people lost their bets the passed few hours. The support is big this time
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:11:22
Because they never understood the technology and used it as a bullshit claim to justify their get rich quick gamble approach.
It's also the influx of people who missed out on this same "get rich quick gamble" and love to take it out on those who made losses.
But the majority of these accounts are probably payed shills or FUD accounts
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:11:54
or you could buy one, and use it to mine yourself.
In 2 year or so you make enough profit to pretty much pay back the card.
I just leave it mining during the nights and use it for gaming and other stuff during the day. win win
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:36:17
Soo, who sold last night expecting a drop in value?
"this is pump &amp; dump"
"Head &amp; shoulders"
"4k bottom or it didn't happen"
Its funny, a lot less hate right now.
BTC is here to stay
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:12:17
This sub will flow with tears soon
So many haters who "predicted" sub 1K, yet here we are.
Haters, i hope you sold and realised your losses. Karma is a bitch
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:47:07
People who still think Alts have the potential to overtake BTC, at least within their current states, simply have no clue about the tech and the potential problems most alts will end up into when adoption increases.
Thats not even including all the ICO funded coins that will just turn into a massive dump scheme when they decide the profits are high enough.
Be my guest and invest all your money into alts because you think they will generate 1000% returns like btc did, most of them will go down in the sea, and your investment money with it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:33:44
FOMO, thats all it is
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:58:41
sooo, who's still waiting for that "2nd support test @ 6k"
Rip boys
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:23:39
how can he lose millions when his favorite coin gets pumped?
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:15:55
it means someone whas verry eager to get into the BTC train. 
It also means the bad sentiment (btc = dead) is turning into FOMO now (fear of missing out) because its recovering at such a fast phase we could see 10k by the end of the week at this rate.
Sentiment can turn, because less then a day ago this sub was flooded with haters predicting sub 2k btc value, now that it seems to be turning arround they all vanished into thin air.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:55:28
The reason is probably related to this: 
One guy had his 1000$ purchase duplicated 17x, 
Now is not a good time to use coinbase i'm afraid
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:54:59
The live link still refers to this article which has the description mentioned above.
Only thing that was shown as a "correction" was an image uploaded on twitter, could verry well be edited just to get some follower activity.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:03:48
Fuck off and get educated, you useless piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:09:23
they didn't get hacked, they are using it to cover up their own incompetence.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:19:02
If you didn't spend all your purchasing money you will have better entry points in the comming days most likely. 
Its not going to rebound like this just that easy. Traders will take profits on the way up a lot of times, or the other way arround for that matter. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:04:46
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:40:53
bull trap or recovery
Still to early to tell but it's looking better
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:00:01
You might want to read this OP:
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:15:33
where is rollercoaster bitcoin when you need him
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:25:14
didn't say its over, but i'm pretty confident now that we're neve going to see sub 1k. 
Maybe that sounds idiotic, but what others claimed is then considered far far more idiotic sooo.
Did i trigger you? did you sell with a loss? :D
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:45:13
When you wake up and you're back in green.
DCA paying off right here
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:06:57
You don't need your phone. You can switch your 2FA settings if you log into your google account that was used to link it on your phone.
I'd check here first, maybe you can regain acces this way 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:46:26
lol, untill the point where we enter a bull market and you sell at the bottom. 
To many people burned their money trying to time this market. 
Don't try it, especially if you're only trading in fractions of BTC
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:05:53
Thats not going to happen untill we eliminate last year profits, that would mean sub 2k$. Even at 3k$ the majority of long term hodlers will still be way ahead in green. 
The majority of jan/december/nov have probably been shaken out by now, except those who understand the long term value of btc and see this as a temporary thing.
Pannick sellers are long out by now, this is just pure demand and day traders deciding the price at this point imo
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:12:58
i did a €2k transaction with a fee of €1,90 3 weeks ago, when the standard fee was still set at €15+. 
Transaction confirmed over 200x the morning after.
Educate yourself before spewing arround bullshit, we have to much of it these days
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:58:59
 
How about this? don't be so fucking ignorant
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:17:02
Thats like saying these bots can perfectly predict market behavior. 
Fact: they don't.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:44:29
Yeah, untill alts will go to shit because they end up being a centralised authority or they get scaling issue's 100x worse then BTC experienced last month.
Good fucking luck, If you guys really believe alts can take over BTC at its current state, you are seriously misinformed and just gambling on the crypto space right now
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:45:15
this could still be a bull trap, to early to tell. If we keep this momentum sideways for the entire week then maybe we might start considering this a recovery.
We had jumps back to 13-15k before but long trendline it still went downwards. 
It's definitly looking much better today tho
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:03:30
Can confirm. Recent dip moved my avarage down by 2k€
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:18
good luck

FOMO ENGAGE
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:48:20
With the EU hearing today i doubt there will be much buying sentiment.
Don't expect anything different from the last few days
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:08:33
Looks like the guy selling at the top really fucked himself over lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:00:07
Also H&amp;S forming on the 5 day graph. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:25:23
i know right?! Yet tha majority on tradingmarkets keeps spewing bear trend bullshit. 
It's like they are posting TA's just to convince themselves they made a good bet
It's getting hilarious at this point
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:10:07
so if you simply held you would be in profit now. 
Thats why you DCA and don't lose your shit if it's down 5-10% assuming you planned for this long term and you can actually afford to lose it. 
If this scared you you need to re evaluate your ammount you're investing or if you actually believe in crypto's (or btc's) long term fundamentals
If you're trying to trade this on a short duration, don't.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:14:05
So all these people in here still holding? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:45:47
Yeah, touche. I guess i still have a wrong idea on "long term" inside the crypto universe. It's hard to grasp that most people got in below 1/2k$  so even at todays trends they are still unaffected by a great margin. (unless they kept accumulating and the avarage exceeded todays current value)
As for me, I'm in red right now. I started in august, so i did witness the august/sept &amp; nov "dips", which are hardly dips in comparison to this.
Which was kind of my point, it's easy to scream to hodl and act like it's no big deal. But how many would still be here if their profits were gone and they'd be facing days in red for a much longer time then any crash that took place since 2014. 
Ive said this so many times, but i only really respect the hodlers that endurred mt gox bear market for nearly 2 years. THAT was dedication to this technology. Hodling in a pretty much consistent bull market (2016 and up) is easy.
I don't think any major dips/crashes during the course of those 2 years generated as much bad sentiment then it did this month alone. But I could be biased right now because i haven't really endured a crash like this before.
I'm still hodling and have no intentions to sell, i planned this for long tearm (3 years) by then the ammount i invested is just a small fraction of my networth. regardless, no one likes to lose money.
Thanks for your humble input though.
