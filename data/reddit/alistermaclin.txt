yes. everyone must pay $500 for the 'thing' with a price of $415 and be happy.

this transaction appeared on bc.i 2 minutes before the block was mined

Can you split the "pie" of "60-70" to three smaller parts? 
 * 60-65
 * 65
 * 65-70

“Bitcoin” is the ledger of not-previously-spent, validly signed transactions contained in the chain of blocks **1mb each because of consensus rule** that begins with the genesis block (hash 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f), follows the 21-million coin creation schedule, and has the most cumulative double-SHA256-proof-of-work.
Majority decides move to 2mb block? Good Idea? Not Bitcoin.

My bug. I thought that SHA-1 is 256-bit like SHA-256. Sorry for some panic posts :)
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:26:50
Bitcoin has opcodes for SHA1 also, but they are not used for usual funds transfering. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:38:34


these two pdfs have the same lengths and difference in first 320 bytes. sha-1 is block algorithm, so you can shorten the provided files to 320-byte "headers" and sha1 function of these chunks will be the same also

Ok, thank you. Seems to me that most of these transactions are from bc.i online wallet. bc.i takes the maximum possible size for ecdsa signature when counting the fee. And for standard tx with one input and two outpus we get 14690/226=65 satoshi per byte or 14690/225=65.28(8) sat/b... etc
In fact I need only current(last) values for my dirty purposes :)

We are here not to parse mempool but for speculating about bitcoin price. This question is much more important. :)
By the way. It can be interesing to have third chart on your page. First is transaction count by fee, second is transaction size (sum) by fee, third is transaction value (sum) by fee
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:10:18
already 
update: my fault. sha-1 returns 160 bits, not 256. everything is ok. sha-1 is broken, collision proven, bounty claimed

because of  
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:57:59


There is no difference what was the fee for your own transaction confirmed in your block. Because any fee goes back to you.

What is the private key for &lt;pubkey B&gt;?

withholding segwit part is a problem even segwit is activated
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:29:08
We can help each other enlarging our ~~penises~~ lists by exchanging unknown keys. I can give you a list of used addresses which keys I know. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:34:46
Good time for sending transactions with conflicting inputs :)
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:28:50
yes. and this will be the end
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:50:28
It is possible to recover your funds. You should import the invalid QR-code into blockchain.info wallet (import -&gt; scan QR-code) and check WIF-format ( KwDi.... ) of resulting address
We can see here two bugs, not one.
1) Coinbase gave you wrong encoded qr-code 
2) BC.I accepted it as valid private key and gave you the address of it

Not today. Just speculating about it.
What about weak signatures? Sometimes I use them to reduce size of my transactions to leave more space for other people.

Sic transit gloria mundi :)

no. may be yes, but hard


 is tighting mining policy
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:56:37
It will be near to impossible to buy bitcoins at zero price. Because there will be no miner to transfer them.

@_date: 2015-11-30 08:32:03


Why should I?
@_date: 2015-11-30 07:25:00
Miners can reject "fake sigop" transactions. This is not hard-fork, but policy "blacklisting with new rules"
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:54:28
Impossible. Removing limits = hard-fork.
@_date: 2015-10-18 17:52:14
It is not possible. There is already Proof-of-Work
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:41:49
At what difficulty? :)
@_date: 2015-10-14 11:59:10


Laws like what? Sending transactions is a right for any bitcoin node. If you have difficulties with a big number of transactions - this is your own problem, you are welcome to switch your node off. You can call this behavior as "attack" but you should prove that it is not standard network behavior

There is no "legal" or "illegal" things in bitcoin protocol.

millions also called the earth is plain and based on elephants and tortoise. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 11:23:32
I do not know how to explain it... But the article on a website about UK laws is less than nothing for a person from another country. The terms "legal" and "illegal" are used when the third-party exists and able to resolve conflicts.
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:16:44
what would be best economically reasonable strategy for those miners who will switch off their hardware?
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:11:48


What? Not a problem? Not a problem for whom?
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:14:58
Bitcoin does not solve this problem.
Bitcoin **purchases** the solution :)
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:13:39
But what is the cost of this immutability?

Is this going to increase or decrease? :)
