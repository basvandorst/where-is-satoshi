That's nice. Too bad you are a pro-censorship POS that will probably be filing for bankruptcy in a few years when everyone leaves Twitter.

Fuck captain censorship.

Twitter needs to die and disappear.

Jack Dorsey is a POS.

At this point I'm only looking to buy a couple hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin. 
I will however keep your suggestions in mind for the future. Thanks!

I guess you could always put a fake seed card in the safe, and hide the real one elsewhere. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:46:27
Bookmarked. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:47:56
Ah OK, thanks for the clarification.

So let's say I want to pay a monthly subscription to a site for a VPN, seedbox, etc., and they take Bitcoin. What's the most practical way of going about that?

Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:49:57
Awesome! I'll check all the links out!

I'll read up on 4 and 5. 
(edit: Meant 4 and 5. Safe is pretty self explanatory. :) )

I guess I'm trying to be more proactive since I'm interested in bitcoin as a form of investment, but am a little ways away from being able to commit any "large" amount of money into the currency. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:25:37
Some sites only accept Bitcoin, so that is part of it.

Getting my feet wet and learning more about bitcoin, as I may consider putting money into bitcoin as a long term investment.
