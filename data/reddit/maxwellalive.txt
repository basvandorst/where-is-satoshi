I agree, but diversification isn't a bad idea in these confusing times.

I love how this poor guy wants nothing to do with Bitcoin, but is still being used as the face of Satoshi in all these art projects!

You guys should really take some to understand what you've invested in.

I've become an Irish citizen and am considering opening a Euro bank account thanks to Brexit.

Again, I think it comes down to timeframe. Indeed there are some prohibitive issues presently, such as the private key one. I think it's reasonable to assume solutions will come about eventually. The economic incentive and transformative potential to innovating within this problem\-space are too high to be ignored.
Let's not forget banks consist of people. A centralised organisation is just one of many ways said people could interact with the world. Blockchain provides a new menu of people structures that could emulate \(or better, exceed\) the services and products of traditional financial institutions, including the ones you mention.
Per the financial history remark, unlike now, blockchain will make such information effortless to disclose. Obfuscating risk through complex formulae \(i.e. the subprime mortgage scandal\) will be difficult as everything published will fall under the scrutiny of the open\-source community, similar to peer review. As a contributor to said formulae, you will be compensated in proportion to the profits others make using your risk management smart contract. It is therefore in your financial interest not to defraud your userbase, which wasn't the case in 2009.
I understand the world I'm describing seems quite radical from a contemporary viewpoint. I don't expect any of this to happen without considerable time and turbulence between now and this potentially fairer future.
It's very possible I've overlooked many things in this admittedly speculative overview of blockchain potential. My fundamental point is that banks are an arbitrary entity and needn't necessarily exist as humanity advances.
**Edit:** I should point out, none of my words take into account the impact of sophisticated artificial intelligence. As I keep saying, timeframe is the crucial factor in all of this.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:22:15
I suppose this ultimately comes down to the timeframe you're envisioning.
Cryptocurrency enables many of the services you just described to be decentralised.
For example, a mortgage lender could be a DAO consisting of retail investors. The smart contract governing lending could be engineered by financial experts to risk manage using similar methodologies to banks.
Cryptocurrency really could spell the end to centralised financial institutions (eventually). I agree in the short-term, banks will do everything to exploit this new paradigm, but after sufficient time, they will be rendered redundant by decentralised society.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:47:21
A truly decentralised currency is governed by everyone through consensus.
For a change to take place, developers must write Improvement Proposals and make Pull Requests (both of which are democratically arbitrated).
Following this, the majority of full-nodes must run the new code. The final vote is then cast by the market, which evaluates each blockchain's worth after a hard-fork.
Bitcoin Cash is an example of the network rejecting a change to block-size. Had the network accepted it, Bitcoin Cash would be Bitcoin Core.
This couldn't be any more different to fiat currency!

I assume you are basing this on the two previous cycles, meaning you have a total of two data points. That's insufficient data to form a trend.
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:00:19
I like clean sentences. "Personhood" captures "you as a person" in fewer words.
If you must baselessly mock Internet strangers for word choice, perhaps your lens of criticism should be turned inward to examine your own character.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:21:42


What does that even mean? I don't think anyone's concern with big blocks is that they "don't scale."
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:59:58
We don't know the length of the third one, which is what I mean by data point.

Both yourself and u/KarstaaMauka aren't taking into account that the US Government also needs the business of the banks.
Why do you think the bailouts happened last decade?
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:13:45
There's no need to be so defensive. I am not attacking your personhood.
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:01:38
And why is that?
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:44:10
Please do not invoke whataboutism.
Your statement is irrelevant to my point, which was not made to defend OP.

America isn't the world.
This is such a typical American attitude...

I'm British. I use British building societies and multi-national banks.
How do you imagine the US government could control my crypto spending?

We are discussing whether the period for each cycle is increasing. The current cycle cannot be used in determining this as its period is unknown.
I don't really get why this is so difficult to grasp.
@_date: 2019-11-30 14:41:29
Perhaps you could elaborate?
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:47:37
I was actually implictly asking for clarification on which data u/Titanruss was using to form their claim; the assumption being it was the last two (where we do see a change in period).
It wasn't really structured as a question though and I could have been clearer.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:14:35
You guys are becoming more and more delusional each time I check into this place.
None of us know what the future holds; do yourself a favour and stop pretending otherwise.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:50:02
I get that OP is implying volatility is deferring people's entry-point, making it advantageous to buy-in now rather than when there is more certainty.
It's still a statement though. I was hoping for something more substantial.

I'm new to trading cryptocurrencies. I understand this to be a non-typical shutdown rather than something scheduled and expected. Am I wrong?

Why is this rude, unhelpful comment the most upvoted? I came here from Google, hoping to find a good answer to these very reasonable points raised by OC.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:16:04
Not really.
It's a statement.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:16:40
I agree! This isn't really acceptable on a currency trading platform.

Says the guy who cannot grasp the meaning of "data point."

Either that, or don't day trade at all, instead rewarding good projects with long-term investment.

Following basic economic principles, reduced supply will increase ASIC prices (if demand remains constant). However, it's also possible that Bitmain will dump their warehouse stock onto the market at "closing down sale" prices.
Basically, I don't know.

This is the embodiment of corruption.

Last time I checked, prospects had never looked better! Do you only measure industry success by the size of your own pockets?

I have friends who are genuinely shocked they're not millionaires yet after jumping aboard the FOMO train in December.

I'm not sure why you've been downvoted. They are indeed unhappy about the Patreon turn of events. Sam Harris spoke about it on his most recent Podcast.
I don't think it's unfeasible that Peterson would start evangelising decentralised value exchange.
