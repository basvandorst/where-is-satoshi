The guys that design programs design them for merchant and consumer use, not commenting on the principle or the method, just guessing why they want it to work that way. Not sure shady is quite right if companies like coke once used subliminal messaging to sell product and microsoft bullied companies to only use their OS and standard oil bribed trains to only carry their oil and banks......    This is just knowing psychology and applying it on your product so the merchant doesn't buy or use the product that did their homework and will earn the merchant a few more dollars. Again, I'm guessing--I'm sure the op could give you more insight.

Then your logic (as reductionist as it is) also applies to everything, houses are only assembled parts of earth that we assign value to, gold is only metal that we assign value to, cash is only fabric that we assign value to, credit cards are just pieces of plastic that we assign value to--not sure that being digital excuses it from being regulated when it is being exchanged for already regulated goods and services.

States can mine Bitcoin which means they could act as issuers. And while they are not be able to decide the details of which Bitcoins are minted, they could decide that only Bitcoin that they have mined are legal tax payments. Forcing, either a mass exodus of people unwilling to have Bitcoin regulated, or more likely, a premium for the coins they minted--you may be able to hide the purchase of a coffee or hamburger with Bitcoin, but can you hide a boat or a house?
I'm not in favor of this, but Bitcoin will be regulated by sensible measures or by the barrel of a gun. The small asset individual may be able to one-over the government sometimes, and if they're smart, but large asset holders and corporations will have no realistic way of hiding large holdings in BTC

It creates task-pay or bounties. If you're efficient,  it will benefit by allowing you to take more bounties than a slower employee. If you're slow, the future's gonna suck. And once workers have to compete with machines for bounties, look the fuck out. 
Thought test: If you wrote the hash out that miners perform for btc, how long will that take? Now let's say you buy/build a machine to perform this task, how long will it take? Faster, right? Now let's say you manufacture these machines and rent or keep them for yourself, could you build a faster machine at a cheaper cost? And if you build your factory close to a cheap power supply, you could manufacture inferior machines, but your costs could still net you better production.

You'd like to go 700ish, but it's not going to happen--the coins have been governmentally washed, so they're golden come accounting time--so maybe you're thinking 750-850--so 800ish. But you've got to outbid the people who are running the same numbers--so maybe, 900-1000. Egh, a 1000? I can live with it--but shit--but there's no back-up that works. What'd the miner want for a 1000 coins--fuck that! And no one wants them dirty coins.....So I'm at a $1000 and an over-bid, and an over-bid, and an over-bid.....
Good luck getting that number right. You'd need to see what the miner's terms were for clean coins before you can get a fair assesment. It's really cold math--you bid just below your estimate is on how much it would to buy them as freshly minted from a miner.

This video validates what Einstein was saying. Knowing the names of things by root knowledge is not the same thing as understanding them. The bird example illustrates this point. You know the name of the bird, but do you understand the bird enough to explain it? How does it fly? How does it mate? What habits are particular to this bird? Does it have a distinct personality? Do other birds like him? Does he get laid a lot? How did his parents treat him? Is he a good listener? Does he have a particular song or songs he likes to sing? Was he born knowing these songs or were they developed over many years? How does this bird see the world? Do other species of birds see the world differently? And on and on and on...and until you can explain these things simply, you don't understand this bird.

It doesn't need to be Bitcoin, it's just that it's the largest and most secure and you can enter the market without having to build your own network.
Those systems aren't efficient--security is a cost and they have proven over and over again to be insecure, and top down solutions have shown that greed and incompetence is man's inefficiency--if man wasn't either of those then there would be no need for a trustless system. Your model of efficiency is flawed because man is flawed--if men always acted in the best interest of the networks they built, then you're right, they would be more efficient. It wasn't by accident that Bitcoin came out of the ashes of the 2008 economic crisis.

You've got to break down each part and understand so it's simple. Trying to explain the whole thing without explaining the parts first is were everyone is failing. What is a node? What is a miner? How do they interact? What's a hash? What's an algorithm? 
Einstein's point was it has to be simple, not understandable to the whole world. He got it down to E=mc2. I think only a very few people are born with the gift to translate complex nomenclature into general speech, but these people always understand their subject. There are also many people who can do certain things without understanding how they work--take the dumb jock who gets laid a lot; he doesn't understand women, he just knows how to get laid. Could you imagine this guy taking the uber nerd and trying turn him into a sex machine? Would he call the nerd stupid for not being able to act in a way that the jock doesn't even understand himself? I believe this reddit is filled with many people who understand Bitcoin as an entity, but not how all its parts work together or very much how any of the parts work outside of the system. Einstein didn't say it would be easy to gain that type of understanding, it took a genius in his case. I think we have Andreas, and does anyone, outside of Satoshi, understand Bitcoin better than Andreas? Not by accident that his Bitcoin explanations come out smooth and easy--he gets it.

We're dueling hypotheticals here, but in the scenario we're talking about, no one would go all in at once. Nor could anyone afford to buy all the Bitcoin--especially since it's still being mined, and there are people who won't sell at any price. No sane person thinks that way. As far as reserves go, maybe, but if a country did their own mining they could create a sustainable infrastructure that could integrate BTC as a currency over time. Hypotheticals in a dynamic technology in its early stages is like writing science fiction--the truth would sound so outlandish that no one believe a word of it could come true.

My problem with this statement is:
A. How do you test the validity of it?
B. How does it help a person become wealthier?
For A, you've included everything in your analysis: "(socioeconomic status of parents, genes, education, connections, etc)" is essentially everything and anything. How do each one of these contribute? Is there a percentage in which a particular factor contributes? If were essentially what are genes make us to be, then isn't it fair that some people are more wealthy than others IE they have more talent, they're smarter, ect, and doesn't this imply what the original comment was saying "The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage that fear." is true and thus invalidates your "No...." The main problem with your statement is that it is too vague to be testable and someone could easily manipulate information to  prove or disprove it--so kind of a useless statement given too many qualifiers (ect is infinite).
B. If I were to chose to become wealthier, knowing that most or all the factors in becoming wealthier are beyond my control, what options do I have for becoming wealthier?

I already said "demands ever sophisticating security measures." Satoshi already outlined this in the white paper so don't think it needs repeating on why this makes the current banking model inefficient and expensive. 
"If he actually reads your email he's just going to laugh at this. A government regulator charged with reducing money laundering and scams will not think that's a brilliant feature."
It shouldn't matter if he's trying to balance regulation with cost benefits, then my argument stands that he should keep exchange regulation but limit regulation for small transactions.
"That's the whole point. But beyond that why was anyone expecting anonymity to reign for a system with a massive public ledger? Bitcoin from the start wasn't designed to be very anonymous."
White paper again--this is designed so consumers don't have to worry about companies being forced to keep their information to offset chargebacks. This keeps things cheaper for companies and safer for consumers.
"Why? Target ended up footing for its mistake the bill and consumers didn't lose their savings. That's quite a bit different than MtGox."
Target customers ended up footing the bill--whether by lost time by new card requests or with increased costs in purchases to recoup chargeback losses.

"I disagree.full on anonymity is only a dream. as soon as you need to buy something physical you basically broadcast that you have/had/are involved with xy (anon) coin." 
The problem with the above statement is that it doesn't take into account organizational use of an anon coin. 
EX. A corporation may not want a competitor to know their financial movements until a product is delivered, a government agency may not want the world to know who, or what, they're funding, or an international  cartel may not want anyone privy to their profits, so they pay their employees in anonymous coins and let them take on the spending risks.
Your argument doesn't take into account agencies that work above the law, outside the law, or who only need their purchases to be anonymous for only a brief time IE. I don't care if the tax-man knows in April; I just need my competitor not to know before December.

Where is the actual evidence backing up any of the claims (well other than that a bug was exploited -- that is true, and the bug is fixed). I was specifically talking about the most recent exploit by BXS (Bitcoin Express), IE the timewarp attack that proved to be FUD.
I do believe there are botnets but I don't believe they are nearly as much of the hashrate as FUDsters speculate, simply because mining is still profitable for a lot of people (not with high electricity rates). As long as mining is profitable, people will do it, especially in the current environment when it is hard to find anything you can mine profitably. 
If botnets were rampant the hash rate would be even higher and mining profit would drive down to nearly nothing. It isn't.

It shows "an impressive amount of intelligent high school students know about Bitcoin"--most of these kids went to high school  and many graduated early and I'm sure many were introduced to Bitcoin before college. So taking that most prestigious universities have a Bitcoin club that was created by student's interest and many had an interest before college, or have an interest when most are still attending high school, that indeed an impressive number of high school students have an interest in Bitcoin. Impressive will probably be the variable--but i think the better variable is how impressive the students are and not in if their number is impressive.

To just say out of hand, "There's been over 1000 altcoins created now, and all you have for innovation" is a bunch of loose hand waves?"  is to miss the my point that there is at least one coin that offers a different set specifications than Bitcoin. And it only needs to be one and the dismissal of "all them alts" becomes the arrogant presumption that Bitcoin can't be surpassed, when like any technology, it certainly can.

A.You make it sound like you can turn it off--if you can't what's the point of crying over spilled milk?
B. You're making the assertion that new jobs won't be created by the more efficient system that cuts out middle services that drain resources. It's not an absurdist's notion to think ob and Bitcoin markets will create more markets the same way computers created more jobs. Would love to see some figures on global job markets before and after the internet and the pc revolution--but again, even if there's a diminution of jobs, unless you can stop the progress, you're crying over a bygone era and would better serve yourself to redirect your energies on creating something useful, and maybe replace those jobs that were lost to more efficient systems.

I'm in retail and would love to have system that adjusted our payroll  (with BTC of course) to the amount of business we are doing that day--if we could get payroll available to match the customer spending ASAP, we would gain employee support when we most need it, and that would boost our sales.
We already use on-call shifts and corporate tries to leverage hours when we need them, but whatever system they are using  doesn't make the hours available as we need them, it's usually a day late, a dollar short. We couldn't use a BTC system ourselves at the moment (we're not the most tech friendly company), but this seems like an obvious use for when we do accept BTC.

Many are working on nanotubes that would allow us to create elevators to space stations where ships could be built and deployed without the cost of escaping earth's gravity which is where most of the bulk and cost of rockets comes from. Once ships, or more likely drones, reach asteroids they could use the resources they mine to make more ships to go to more asteroids--kind of like early explorers used islands with resources as bases to launch further exploration. This kind of mining would allow for exponential growth without the costs of having to ferry resources from earth. In this model, resources beget more resources and send the overflow back to earth or outlining colonies.

Oh I agree, but most of r/bitcoin downvotes all things alt. If you posted a text on how Bitcoin's anonymity isn't the only problem, but how also its lack of cash-like fungiblity would allow exchanges and companies to blacklist tainted coins the same way coinbase does with gambling sites, you'd probably get a better reception than saying any alt is the cure; most people want to believe you can create an ancillary solution that still utilizes bitcoin. It's probably a false belief, but most will not admit it until they see all the "solutions" fail. Bitcoin is good at what it was designed to do, but sucks at what it wasn't designed to do, which is provide total privacy. People need to find the privacy coins for themselves or keep on waiting and waiting and waiting for some savior to come and make Bitcoin the everything coin. Until then, if you want privacy, use cash or find an alt that works.

The author's point was that the price of a bitcoin drops making bitcoin mining too costly to maintain--also too costly to rent for profit--I'm sure there would be a few people dumb enough to mine at cost that far exceed the exchange or street price, but more than likely,  not enough for a big mining facility to maintain operations for very long.
If you have supercomputers, you can rent or lease or sell them based on the supercomputer market which is pretty robust at the moment. You could say that there would be a glut because of the bitcoin miners selling off supercomputers en masse, but that was tested when gpu miners became obsolete for mining bitcoin and the price of a gpu's was hardly affected. Even if it were the case, you would still be able to recoup costs over time by leasing computational power or mitigate your losses by selling the equipment outright--this is not an option for outdated asics because they can't be re-purposed for anything but mining cryptocurrencies and most cryptos are substantially less profitable to mine than bitcoin, and the few that aren't are very similar to bitcoin's profit range. 
So the FACT that miners don't use supercomputers to mine bitcoin does matter.

You wouldn't need to blacklist coins coming from anywhere and everywhere only the ones coming from points you deem suspicious, like from gambling sites, mixers, or unregulated exchanges. Coinbase is already doing this.
You underestimate any governments (the US isn't alone in hacking and using honeypots) ability to probe for information with impunity. You need only go through one honeypot or compromised exchange to have your coins successfully tied to you. I'm assuming you need them to spend them on items or convert them to fiat at some point.

Why would I have it? It's not a coin I follow. I'm presuming its market data doesn't keep in line with the coin I'm talking about because I rarely see it in the top 24hr market volume on coinmarketcap and it would be a strange coincidence if they shared market data for any length of time.
The coin is nubits (which I don't own because what's the point of investing in a coin that is tied to the dollar?) and the privacy coins are monero and boolberry which I do own because btc sucks at privacy and those coins don't. Call it spam, but I don't feel like playing cat and mouse with your accusations about being a bitshare shill.

Masternodes are not good for anonymity; human points of failure that can be used to gather information for metadata are/were being used by three letter agencies during the Snowden fiasco, and any cryptocurrency that uses them is erring on the side of governments either playing by new rules or forgetting what has worked successfully in the past. i'll stick Monero and other ring signature based coins.
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:03:21
Don't make the mistake of lumping all alt coins into the scam heap; this type of arrogance is how technologies get supplanted "from out of nowhere."
Monero is unlinkable, untracable, more fungible than BTC and scalable--that makes it a better candidate for e-cash than BTC. BTC is great as an e-gold, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking it has completed the cypherpunk dream of an e-cash. The two can co-exist, so there is no reason to feel that your Bitcoin investment is threatened. In fact, Monero may help further Bitcoin's acceptance  by allowing Monero to Bitcoin services like XMR.TO which give greater privacy than mixers.

It will be a better thing if more companies don't follow their lead, but who's to say that they're not doing us a favor instead of just revealing that information later, by subpoena or by surreptitious means, to interested government agency.

Anonymity without the ability to use it for goods or services is pretty pointless for most people.
My definition of anonymous is a coin that you can spend without revealing your address or to whom you sent or received payments from--unlinkability. And yes, there are  ring signature based coins that offer unlinkability.

My point was linkage. Cash is anonymous in that it is fungible and not traced (exceptions are few), so I can buy from a store and no one knows where I got that cash from (it could have been earned committing murder or washing a dog) or I could deposit it in my bank account, buy on ebay and order and no knows where that cash came from--this isn't possible with BTC--all coins are traced for all time. An anonymous coin would be untraceable and unlinkable like cash. Bitcoin is neither.
And if the person you paid to pick it up is compromised, what then? This why drug kingpins get busted, links.

Obfuscation methods written on top of pseudonymous methods are inherently weaker than methods that are anonymous at the cryptographic level. I'm not cryptographer so i can't speak to a specific weakness, I just know that people smarter in crtptographic matters than myself like Poelstra and Maxwell want to change BTC at the core rather than on a layer on top of BTC because it is more secure that way.

I don't think you do.
Cash is fungible because I can use it anywhere without explaining where it came from. Can you do this with btc? If you can't, then some btc are not as useful as others which means they are not exactly the same or interchangeable.

You do realize that there is no monitoring of those serial numbers by merchants, so you can use them without fear of being denied service or goods. One dollar is as good as the next.
You do realize that laundry services aren't to change the actual dollars, but to quickly get rid of mass dollars in a way that isn't suspicious to law enforcement. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 08:00:51
Yeah, because no one ever thinks they're smarter than law enforcement and that since they haven't been caught that that means their methods are foolproof./s
Lets make this simple--cryptocurrencies that are anonymous at the mathematical/cryptographic level are inherently more secure (and easier to keep that way) than a pseudonymous currency that must have layers of anonymizing built on top of it. 
And even simpler:
If you want the best off road vehicle, do you put a camry on a lift kit and start tinkering with it to make it off road capable, or do you buy an off road vehicle that was designed from scratch to be the best off road vehicle available? I know my choice. Good luck with yours.

That's inferring a lot. And just because DPR failed at best practices, doesn't mean eventually, even using best practices, he wouldn't have been caught.
So what are best practices? That becomes pertinent if we are going to have an honest discussion about Bitcoin's anonymity.
Mixer? No, unless you can prove the mixer isn't corrupted by an interested agency--the NSA or FBI as example. Corrupted here could be surreptitious probing, a mixer actually owned or run by the snooping agency or someone from the mixer working for the agency or being bribed by them for information.
Buying other alts through exchanges and exchanging them in and out of btc? No, for the same reasons I wouldn't put my faith in a mixer. If you're buying ring signatures coins and you're using their anonymity to to mask you're BTC movements, you're not making BTC anonymous, you're using an anonymous coin to help better mask your pseudonymous coin.
P2p? You are still revealing your ID to the person you're interacting with and depending on them not to reveal it to an agency or not be working with them directly or indirectly.
Have I missed any? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:26:48
Monero has a view key so you can prove that YOUR (and yours alone) transactions aren't being used for things like drugs or kiddie porn. Do some research before you go buttcoin and throw accusations out in order to serve your agenda--my guess is that you're heavily invested in btc and view privacy coins as a threat--they're not, they just add something that btc is missing. BTC still has a trillion dollar market in assets and the internet-of-things. Privacy solutions are like cash; they let you do things like buy milk without the whole world being aware that you buy the 2% because you think you're fat. They should also allow you to keep reciepts that you can show the IRS or FBI to eliminate you from the suspicion of wrong doing--Monero does this, so relax with the accusations.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:25:58

Darknet markets exist because people think they are smarter than the people trying to catch them, and it isn't more of a case of them being small fish in a large pond or them just being lucky. BTC is pseudonymous. Ring signature coins are anonymous. 
Would you not agree that a coin that doesn't broadcast your address publicly over the blockchain or allow anyone but yourself to view your wallet's actions or holdings is more cashlike and more anonymous than btc?

"It may...."
I'm assuming that you either want to spend those btc you stole on items or convert them to cash, right? So you either need to mix them or convert them to other crypto for cash or deal directly with a third party and convert to items or cash.
The first two scenarios depend on the mixer or exchange not being a honeypot or being probed by a three letter agency. So, unless you have proof of privacy, you are taking a gamble on your btc being linked to you.
The third case is fine in small amounts, but as the amounts go up so does the risk of law enforcement taking an interest in you. 
If you've found a fool proof way to guarantee that  your btc cannot be linked to you, I'd love to hear it. 
My point with the examples is that one example doesn't prove a thing true in all cases.

Honeypots with cash? How? You target mixers because they're mixing coins and most likely used as an attempt to launder coins. Am I going to have to worry about spending my money at a restaurant, why? Cash is spent everywhere with no large scale tracing mechanism in place--btc is traced through every transaction.
Creating your own mixer doesn't ease any but your own worries. Unless you can provide proof of privacy, it would be dumb to trust someone based on nothing but their say--and how would you guarantee that an outside source hadn't compromised your mixing service in some way? How would you guarantee to an outside observer that you weren't compromised in some way?

Unless btc starts using ring signitures, btc isn't as anonymous cash. I just think is dangerous to have people walking around thinking that btc is as anonymous as cash.

@_date: 2015-02-01 19:44:57
It's not only a matter of them asking you, it's also a matter of them monitoring addresses they deems suspicious, like ones used by gambling sites, and closing your account.
Then carry smaller bills. Isn't that a matter of stores worried about counterfits? And Coinbase will deny you service, so that is a rejection of btc. Sure you could send it to an address anyhow, but that isn't the same as them accepting it in a manner that will be any use to you.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:45:05
...seems like you're saying btc will be anonymous (in a useful way) somewhere down the road if everything goes as planned. 
Can't imagine many governments are going to allow anonymous shipping knowingly within their borders or their fiat to be traded in an unregulated manner. Maybe time will prove you right, but as of now, btc isn't anonymous in a way that is useful to most people.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:39:33

@_date: 2015-02-01 16:07:44
Someone has already complained that someone who they dealt with on localbitcoins stalked them to a food truck by knowing their address. I'd link but I saw the post on bitcointalk and it is down this second--I'll post a link later when the site is back online.
Are the websites not honeypots (how would you know?)? Are they not being monitored (again, how would you know?)? If you are trading p2p, you would be smart to assume the more transactions you do, or the larger they are, the more likely you will run into a member of law enforcement.
If the only  way to keep btc anonymous is to never purchase it or to mine it and then send it back and forth between btc addressees, what is the point? And even if you can keep it anonymous, you run into the problem of fungibitlity (and this is where btc is NOT like cash). An exchange (lets say Coinbase) can and does blacklist coins that they deem suspicious. It's called taint and it will allow LE and businesses to keep you from using any coin anywhere you want.

If btc was fungible like cash, no one would need to use coin mixers, nor would an exchange be able to close your accounts based on information gathered from the blockchain. Also, assuming you've gamed the system and believe you've outwitted law enforcement by mixing your coins, do you think you are any more or less confident than people who shredded documents and believed no one would ever have the time, resources, or technology to return the document's information back to its original form? 
Personally, I think a fungible and private coin is the right of everyone regardless of their education, technical expertise, or finances.

My question is, "Even if you can make Bitcoin as anonymous as cash (or very close), is that any solace for the millions (probably billions) who aren't adept or don't have the resources to make Bitcoin anonymous?" In my mind, a real cash-like currency would come out of the box anonymous and wouldn't need any special knowledge or tools to be used anonymously.

If someone has your address to deliver goods or services, then you are not buying goods or services anonymously.
Wallet addresses can be linked by pretty rudimentary blockchain analysis. You still need to on or off-ramp from an exchange if you want fiat. Unless you are just sending coins to addresses without receiving goods or services, then this is useless for most people.

"for legal uses..." This point matters. If you have a traceable currency it is horrible for illegal activity whereas an untraceable one is still great for illegal activity no matter if it is legal or not. Quick mental exercise: the US government declares cash and gold illegal because it can't be traced. What happens in the black markets? Do they start using credit cards? Not on you life!  They're going to use gold or find some other way to transfer wealth easily between customer and dealer. I don't think you can outlaw any crypto-currency effectively, and least of all one that is untraceable.
These are opinions, but the fact remains that btc is not as fungible as cash at the present moment--that was my only point.

Good luck with your definition of anonymity. I think btc is pseudonymous just like the creator and the core devs say--not sure why anyone would think they know more about btc than Satoshi.

My definition of anonymous is a coin that doesn't reveal your wallet details on a public blockchain, and one does (a few actually) exist--they all use ring signatures which is a cryptographically secure way to use a blockchain without revealing wallet level information. This is like cash in that coins cannot be linked nor tainted. Bitcoin's failure as an anonymous coin is that it isn't as fungible as a dollar and coins can be linked through the public blockchain. 
I can buy groceries with cash that was used in gambling. I cannot use BTC on Coinbase with funds that were used for gambling without a good chance of my account being closed. See the difference? I can literally have a casino's emblem inked on a dollar and the cashier will never be sure if it was me or someone else who used the dollar at a casino without having witnessed the actual usage or having indisputable evidence provided by me or the casino. Hell, the cashier won't even know if the casino marking is factual without some sort of proof otherwise.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:10:50
The side chain option misses the point of fungible--which is that you can't tell one coin from another and have situations where an exchange (ahem, Coinbase...) is blacklisting accounts based on coin taint. 
So I assumed you would want BTC to go full ring signature at some point if you really wanted BTC to be a true equivalent to cash.  
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:48:47

I'm not arguing with you anymore. Time will tell.  
There's a method that allows for digital transactions without revealing your wallet or the contents of your wallet or the coming and going of your transactions--this is more cash-like than btc. It exist and comes out of the box as anonymous as cash. Even if what you believe about btc is true, it still means that you need expertise and resources to make btc anonymous which does most of the world no good. 
I will use the better privacy coin no matter what it is, and it isn't btc. Use it at your own risk.
