Again, we can't expect something to change without someone fighting for it. 
But, if you believe it that strongly, then don't vote/support her. That's your choice. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:01:47
Seems about right. Awesome!
@_date: 2014-10-09 01:25:20
Did you read her platform? Or just assume she was more of the same two party corruption?
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:31:00
Yeah. They basically told her they didn't want competition and that she would complicate the process. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 01:41:44
So what is your idea? If you don't fight it, how do you expect change? We can't do nothing. I give credit to people that are at least trying to stop the corruption. I think that's why she is running as an Independent, because she didn't want to join the "mob" of the R's or D's. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:27:30
Unfortunately, i think you are right 90% of the time. I do think there are a select few that don'tjusttry to "buy  votes". I can only name three, and Tisha is one of them. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 01:53:00
By this logic, there can be NOTHING good that ever comes from government. Cause the system is flawed. Ron Paul was a major problem, I presume, because he was an R. If those are the "classical" stances that she is following, I'm OK with that. The beauty of it all is that we all have the freedom to believe what we want, donate to whom we want, and vote for whoever we want to. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:57:27
Heck yeah. Tisha (congress woman) and Dr Paul are some of the only politicians in America that give me a slight glimmer of hope :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:54:31
Her platform is pretty much identical to Ron Paul's. Good to hear that from people outside of America. I was starting to feel sorta lonely over here haha!
@_date: 2014-10-09 02:04:34
Touche. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:56:13
The printing presses would be working overtime...if that's possible.
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:27:35
I don't think you can ignore the party and do what you want though. You get shunned by them and you have to initially forget your message that they don't like. Then you are a hypocrite or a liar. I think for a lot of candidates, the message is what they are concerned about most. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:50:49
Haha! She's actually running as an Independent. I agree about the publicity. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:23:52
The republican party kicked her out lol. What's she left to do? Roll over and play dead, and expect change, which obviously hasn't worked. OR run as an independent and do what you can to change the message people are hearing? I agree the system is screwed up, but you can't expect change by not acting. Someone has to try. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 03:15:58
I think there is a difference in being openly deceitful and just not making some stances as public as others or not being totally forthcoming about them....I think she has a message that is resonating with voters. She spent $3.17 per vote in 2012. Incumbent Scott Tipton spent $12.01. Democratic Sal pace spent over $13.50 per vote. The problem is she doesn't have a huge amount if money like they do. Her meagre is killing it. I don't think you change that.

I wrote a long email to him. I won't get responded to, but heck, I have a friend that is an Apple fanatic. I don't think he owns a piece of technology without an apple on it. He saw this news this morning and was like, "Well...companies make mistakes." He happens to be a contributor with the Motley Fool as well...believe me, my e-mail detailed all of this. I for one, will never do business with Apple again between the PRISM scandal and them taking choices away from their customers.

Sorry for the typos. Im on my phone.
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:15:38
...not sure if that was sarcasm or not lol. I just thought it was cool that more and more politicians are recognizing Bitcoin. I think we all want Bitcoin to do well, and if they support it, it would be cool if some of us supported them :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:28:46
Which is exactly why its a good thing, in my opinion :)
@_date: 2014-10-09 01:55:46
You have to start somewhere :).
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:20:51
Haha! I used to write for the Motley Fool...and I loved the company, but there are some articles that blew my mind (in a bad way). 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:24:02
I was just using MtGox, BTC-E, and BitPay as examples in terms we would understand :). 
In their instance, I don't think they are shutting down OKCoin or BTCChina.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:51:49
Yep. Exactly my thoughts.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:20:44
USD is the laughing stock in countries right now. I'm sure you have heard about the bills being voted on in Russia and China about illegalizing USD in their economies as well, right? Why? Cause we print so much of it, they expect a complete collapse of the USD by 2017. You have looked at how much the dollar DECLINES in value each and every year, right?  
I can't speak for everyone out there, but I know several people that own crypto-currencies not because they want to get-rich-quick, but because they don't trust that the USD will be around. They expect it to collapse and don't want their money lost when that happens. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:05:29
I do expect government resistance, and expect much more the more it grows in popularity. Which, I think is good. History has shown that what the governments try to shut down, normally spreads like wildfire. The holocaust certainly didn't eliminate Judiasm. America has been in a war on drugs for decades, with no success. People still use drugs daily. Point is, while I don't expect for BTC to be accepted anywhere without resistance, I don't see why China's news is necessarily bad. Just my opinion, though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:09:44
If one bitcoin is worth $50, that means that USDs are worth 1/50th of the value of Bitcoin. 
I don't know why the American Dollar is so highly respected by some people. We have more debt than any country, we print more money than any country, (which causes inflation, or a decrease in value to the dollar), and we don't allow the free market to work. All I'm saying is Bitcoin obviously has value in the eyes of its users, and that's all that matters, right? Right now, people value Bitcoin at around 525x that of the dollar. So if Bitcoin has "no value", what does that leave the value of the dollar at?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:46:01
Apparently you and I are in the minority lol
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:44:05
I guess my understanding isn't that they are banning the purchase or sells of Bitcoin. My understanding is that they are banning third parties from using it. For instance, they aren't shutting down Mt Gox, BTC-E, or anything like that, but they are shutting down BitPay. In essence, individuals in China can still buy and sell Bitcoins, which is what we want, but they can't use it how we use BitPay.

I agree completely. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:29:23
Again, maybe I'm mis-interpreting the news. I understand the news as saying they won't allow third parties (such as the US's BitPay) to do business with Bitcoin. I did not interpret the news as saying the Chinese cannot purchase or sell bitcoins through exchanges like BTC China and/or OKCoin.

"If there's a commodity with some value, the world will buy it and trade it according to the fundamental principles of economics. The trouble is, when there's a commodity with no value, there's great potential for abuse by those who want to get rich quick off the greater fool. That's where regulatory bodies step in and say "Oh, we've seen this movie before, knock it off.""
Let's assume that Bitcoin falls to $50. That would be significant, by anyone's standards. But it is still worth 50x as much as the American dollar. Our dollar must have next to zero value?
