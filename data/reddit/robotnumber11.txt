Interesting to compare adoption rates of other breakthrough technologies. I note one key difference, however, between Bitcoin adoption and the other technologies in the graph (radio, cellphone, internet, etc.)--government and big business were quickly won over to the merits of those other technologies and actively endorsed and encouraged them, greatly accelerating the uptake by the population. 
Clearly, if governments wanted to encourage bitcoin adoption, it would happen extremely fast. In fact, a government that wanted to encourage Bitcoin could facilitate a transition that was barely even noticeable to the average consumer. But we currently face government and entrenched-business resistance, and that makes it a different matter entirely than radio or colour TV adoption.
Of course, circumstances change, and something that seems worth resisting now might be seen as beneficial later. But until then, the headwinds for Bitcoin are stronger than for other breakthrough technologies.

Of course Jamie isn't the only one saying this. Ken Rogoff says gov't will crush bitcoin as well. However Rogoff is also on record saying governments should get rid of cash, so he's clearly not on "our" side either. Not sure I trust Rogoff's perspective any more than Demon's, even if Rogoff is a chess grandmaster. ;-)
More interesting to me is that Martin Armstrong says Bitcoin will not survive, because government "will never allow it" once it becomes a threat. Martin Armstrong is so annoying in many ways, but he has also been incredibly right over and over again in his predictions. And he IS on "our" side in the sense that he hates the banks and is as suspicious of government as any of us.
So could Marty Armstrong be right? Or is he a dinosaur too. Maybe he's out of touch. His writings have become increasingly incomprehensible.
