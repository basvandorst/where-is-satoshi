Woooo [It's Happening!!!](

IMO, it should mirror legislation (if any) that gold mining or silver mining does.
I don't have any ideas what those may be, but it all seems isomorphic to me.

Thanks, that makes sense.
For a $150 investment, I don't think I would lose anything, even if the price did go down.
Am I correct in assuming that the risk is fairly low for this product?

That was my exact target.  I am a huge League fan, so some of my next tips are probably going to go to a pro gamer that posts on there for more exposure.
I have attempted to message people like GuardsmanBob or Phantoml0rd to get a bitcoin donation thing setup on their twitch.tv, but nothing yet.  I didn't pick real high end pros mainly because they don't accept donations on their stream.

The duration of the mining at 100% is what did it.  High end games don't use 100% of your GPU all the time, and benchmark tools only use 100% for a short time.

I love humble bundles, and I've gotten the last 3-4 or so. This just makes it a lot easier.  I preferred paying via Bitcoin than using my debit.  More secure, and more safe.

Bottom line is, you made money.  I wouldn't dwell on it.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:53:17
Just like paper money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:10
Exactly this.  Just wait it out.

To be honest, Monsanto has blocked legislation to label items as GMO and they also have put through a lot of legislation to protect themselves as of late.   Do some research on the soy bean and soy bean seeds and Monsanto, it's sickening.

iirc the order numbers do not correlate with the actual position you are in the queue.  I think I read that someplace in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:55:10
I am putting some of your chap stick on as we speak, I love your products!
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:30:27
same here, just transferred within minutes to the reddit bitcointip bot.

I prepaid for mine through paypal.  That way I didn't have an expenditure hanging over my account that I might forget about.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:53:01
one word - panic
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:55:52
Second one now bought through bitcoin.  :) Feels good.
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:42:43
that is what I was thinking.  I would still give a regular tip in standard currency, and then give a small tip with bitcoin to promote it with an educational piece.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:00:14
If the price was competitive, I would have bought some through this service.
:( Double the price? Too much margin for what the service offers.

They need to pull all of their ATI graphics cards as well then if they said "bitcoin related hardware"  
Key word there is "related"
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:00:08
I posted [this]( in r/Leagueoflegends yesterday.
I was trying to raise awareness to the streamers who accept donations, that this would be a viable source of accepting donations.
As soon as we get someone of fame, Dyrus, TheOddOne, Phamtoml0rd, etc. talking about this, it'll catch wildfire.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:21:15
I think I broke my F5 key....
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:48:56
Now only if I remember my login to slush's pool that I had years ago.... *sigh* lol I didn't do much with it, but I bet I would be a thousandaire as well.
Congrats :D
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:25:45
I remember it as well... and I managed a server room full of servers with a lot of idle cpu, and had 10 high end video editing bays that could have been used after hours as well.  *sigh* 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:06:38
:( They probably did the same thing to me then. It's been a couple years.

People have an inherent distrust of Java, but they don't realize that it's the browser plug-in that is the main point of attacks online.
