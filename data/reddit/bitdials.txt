Thanks for your opinion!
We offer only 100% genuine original timepieces from Rolex, Breguet, Breitling, Hublot, IWC, Chopard, Cartier and some other brands, as well as jewelry from Chopard and Bvlgari (ok, jewelry section is still under construction).
We are not new in watch business and if you prefer you can ask for preferences at Chrono24 (worldwide famous marketplace for watches) or at BitPremier (we have listings there and sold already few watches with them).
Please ask for references for A.C.Watches Frankfurt as BitDials is actually a new project of A.C.Watches Frankfurt.
Additionally you can ask for pictures or videos , if it helps.
If apply it's always possible to pick up the watch in person in Frankfurt am Main (Germany) and even check for genuineness of the watch before with official dealer.
It is also possible to get the watch delivered to some cities in Europe with our own courier and buy in person also.
If you have any ideas how we can help you to get feeling of safety and go forward to deal, please don't hesitate to contact us. We will try to fulfill any realistic suggestion and proposal.
Have a nice day!
P.S. Please check our new offers next days as we are still building up our full catalogue.
