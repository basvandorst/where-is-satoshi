That you are an expert in A it doesn't automatically make you an expert in B.

You wife is sexing for money?
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:12:30
Keychain sounds a bit offensive for people involved in slavery.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:11:00
What difference does it make if entity is identifiable?

THIS TIME IT WILL BLOW THE EARTH OFF THE SPACE

One of those is cryptocurrency - Monero.
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:03:47
Makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:27:06
What problem they can have with Bitcoin? It is dream currency for surrveilance state.
@_date: 2019-03-01 11:46:42
Swiss banks still have dead Nazis money... your jurisdiction is shite

People who grown up brainwashed by the left wing teachers can't accept that money driver is embedded in human nature. You can do all regulations you want, but people will do what their instincts tell them anyway. That then usually ends up in building concentration camps (Hitler, Stalin and other left wing heroes)
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:34:56
That is very much in the context.
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:46:59
Or do things in reverse - expect no contact before getting anything done
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:13:08
Escorts don't participate in an intercourse. That's what my girlfriend told me.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:13:09
You cut a hole in a hammock and an escort take a shit through that hole straight to your mouth as you lie underneath it.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:16:16
My girlfriend is one and a half human, but still only two rear holes.
@_date: 2019-02-19 07:27:40
The name + bitcoin suggest the "hotels" are the spaces in favelas...
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:32:13
Not entirely true. In some countries e.g. UK you can get 5 years for not disclosing your password.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:35:07
Who gives him their hair?
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:19:00
Your balance and whole transaction history. This is available unencrypted in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:57:45
Defence grade means it can be decoded by the army.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:01:53
That probably means disabled call recording.
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:40:20
Samsung blocked call recording.
@_date: 2019-02-19 08:02:31
But bitcoin already shares everything publicly. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:26:15
They blocked it in Oreo on their own.
@_date: 2019-02-19 10:54:00
Private key is a password in this context.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:01:08
It could have bj feature and 16k screen if it cannot record calls then this is just an awkward tablet.
@_date: 2019-02-19 10:53:27
When you make a purchase you expose yourself. Also government can ask exchanges to disclose owners of given keys 
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:24:05
This is the reality we live in... 
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:20:21
If they ban adsense on such sites...
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:57:36
Can you blacklist Bitcoins in bisq? What happens if someone sells you coins that were acquired through a crime?
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:04:21
Optional privacy is not a solution. That will create second class coins - for example shops could reject coins that have no history. That's why I view Bitcoin as a store of value, whereas future money is Monero.
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:21:16
Is there a difficulty for a bank to buy most of Bitcoin available for sale?
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:44:55
People like the author could be called useful idiots. Every totalitarian system needs them.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:48:38
I find it disturbing that people in Venezuela blame government rather than socialism, and then want new government that this time get socialism right (which is impossible)...
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:27:19
Because just as fiat Monero doesn't have attached history, that means you wouldn't have questions you would have with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:45:55
Or cash. But if you have choice between private or public coin then it is a different ball game.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:17:23
I hope so that's where I have my trigger
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:41:51
What's the point of buying other cryptos if you can't withdraw them?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:49:18
How seller can get your bank statement when you pay by card?
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:19:16
The same way they accept fiat.

Norway live off gas.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:28:32
Not always. In democracy most popular player wins.
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:50:15
I didn't but gov could make us if that was possible. With Bitcoin it is.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:37:05
"Iran and Syria to price oil in Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:11:08
They are getting fucked by socialists big time, but I guess they also get their G spot hit with a big government dick.
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:44:32
That's why I don't plan yo visit the US any time soon 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:38:51
That's fraction of a joke fine one of the banks had to pay for laundering drug money. Find something better...
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:28:30
Or they just submitted themselves to state terrorists
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:54:49
People start withdrawing money to buy Bitcoin is what scares banks, because they don't have money to cover it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:46:26
I trust exchanges more than banks. Authorities nowadays are just thugs.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:39:37
Why coinbase has to take the blame if themselves are victim of government bullying?
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:05:33
Because someone doesn't call himself a socialist (for deception) it doesn't mean he isn't one.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:26:02
How about stopping to vote for socialists that need to regulate and know everything?
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:02:34
If you run a business you factor such events in the price of your product. The price grows depending of how "good" you want to be. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:12:46
Why would you feel guilty? You paid for it. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:16:50
Everyone goes left because it is where true power over people is.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:43:20
Much better than banks.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:47:39
Yes, printers are running hot :)
