According to his calculations, the average volatility of the largest 10 virtual coins by market capitalization was more than 25 times higher than the average volatility of American stocks in 2017.
In his speech, the head of the Bank of England voiced the potentially useful properties of blockade technology, which underlies bitcoin, but noted that digital currencies in themselves failed the task of winning the status of real money. At the same time, he denied the idea of ​​creating his own digital currency by the Central Bank in the near future.
