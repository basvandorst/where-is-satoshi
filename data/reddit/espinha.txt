I confess I haven't read it yet but it's a brilliant idea. Go for it and get something out asap... Bitcoin is exploding with popularity, you can easily get Bitcloud to ride the shockwave.

Just one thing I noticed from skim reading the white paper... you guys are probably mathematicians, right? Lisp, lamba expressions... yet you argue that lambda expressions are the best approach because it can be easily parsed by Javascript and so on but somehow I feel JSON would be a much better fit for that, since, you know, it's the JavaScript Object Notation). Anyway, just my opinion from the technology side of things.
Another thing is... from the white paper, it's still not clear to me how the blockchain will fit in this scenario. If you're pushing incentives to the hosters (i.e. people running hardware to serve the content), who's providing those incentives? The user who wants to watch some videos? Youtube is great because it's free, if I had to pay for it I would most definitely try to find a free alternative. I would tread carefully there of what you ask from the users who just want to browse this "internet".

Consider this... unless you have pre-payment, the customer is going to the trouble of paying when he or she could just leave and odds are you wouldn't even notice. Pretending to pay and showing your face as the guy who used bitcoin vs just walking away... well...

This. Seriously, needs a whoooole lot more green to cover the walls and give it some life. But well done!

Well yes, but with the ever fluctuating nature of bitcoin, people will have bitcoins purchased at completely different rates so if I bought bitcoins at... say... $800 and now I'm paying for a service while 1 BTC = $600 then I might as well buy more now and pay with what I just bought since it will effectively be cheaper than using those I bought at $800.

Let's go no further than reddit itself.
A yearly subscription costs $29.99 USD.
When you try to pay with bitcoin they ask you for [0.0483505](
Now show me a website where I can buy 0.0483505 for no more than $29.99 USD.
Edit: one zero too many.

I'm gonna try to give you guys a few pieces of advice which I find relevant:
- Release early, release often. If you're gonna do this, come up with a very basic prototype. Something that does what is the most important of it right now: decentralized hosting. Which takes me to...
- ...it's very ambitious of you to want to replace the Internet Service Providers but... initially, you need them and you're not doing anything ilegal so use them.
- When (I'm being positive here, but 'if') this blows out of proportion and you have a few thousands/millions/billions using your technology, then you can think about actual physical nodes.
What I'm thinking would be AWESOME is a decentralized Youtube (or any website hosting, for that matter). Think Wuala (seriously, if you don't know them, have a look at these guys because they kinda do this for data storage, but nothing else).
Say I want to publish a website on this new network. The website should *not* be stored in any single computer, but rather in multiple computers whose uptime meets a certain requirement. Wuala does this too.
With Wuala you share a HDD you have at home (lets say you share a 1TB HDD) and if your uptime stays above a certain percentage, they award you with 1TB "on the cloud". This 1TB will be spread across other people's shared HDDs and your own HDD will be sharing pieces of other people's shared stuff (does that make sense?).
Anyway, I'd be happy to help but be wary: if you do this right, you're about to embark on the most ambitious project ever. Something that (again, done right) would put Google's backend to shame.

How can they claim it's unanimous and then say some people don't agree? Honestly asking... I'm all for segwit.

"...declare your Bitcoins for the 2014 taxman declaration.".
Nope. That sounds just weird. The belastingdienst *IS* the internal revenue service of the Netherlands. So... I stand by the name.
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:01:37
It's not strictly US. We call it the same in Portugal. And it's easier to understand this way for an international community.
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:53:32
No idea... my guess is that it will be taxed as if you owned cash. If I'm not mistaken, if you own above a certain amount of cash there's some tax you have to pay. But don't quote me on this.
Edit: Having a second look at it, this section is where you declare your "possessions" including savings and so forth. At the bottom they ask whether the sum of these possessions is above 42278 euro. Above this some tax will apply. But indeed, it's probably of a gray area as to how you can value the bitcoins within this 42k euro limit.
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:57:29
No one actually tells the IRS, but if you lie in your IRS declaration and later it turns out you did so, they may come back to you and ask you to pay tax on it. Of course it's probably quite difficult (or it can be made quite difficult) to track bitcoins to you.

In my opinion this is a good thing. It's another clear sign (if there was need for one) from a sovereign government that Bitcoin **IS** an accepted payment method. That line specifies "virtuele betaalmiddelen" which translates to "virtual payment methods".
This is great news. Sure, they want to tax it but it would be taxed if you had e.g. cash. Just like with cash you're free to incur in tax evasion and just like with cash you may have to face the consequences of such actions.
All in all I'm happy Bitcoin has taken the same status of cash in the Netherlands.

This. While most bitcoiners will indifferently look past this news article, this is truly how it starts. I have to say, if my employer also provided me with this choice, I would do it in the blink of an eye. This is change. This is progress.

I for one perfectly understand OP. All of you say bitcoin has value and whatnot, and guess what: you know why it has value? Because of these six single letters: USD/BTC. That's right. It only has value when you compare it to whatever fiat currency you happen to use **get your salary**.
This is the facts people: bitcoin is amazing, the theory behind it, the anonymity, decentralization... all of that is awesome. All but for one thing: today I buy a pizza for 0,012 BTC (say, roughly $10 USD) and tomorrow, god knows how much I **actually** paid for that pizza! Because had I stuck to those 0,012 BTC, maybe tomorrow they'd have been worth... oh... I don't know... $100(!!) USD.
This is all the more relevant if you consider how you come to acquire BTC. How do most people do this? By using fiat currencies, is it not? I grab $780 USD now and I can get me 1 BTC... I pay my rent (say, 0.5 BTC) and... wai...wha?! My rent just went up because of some screwed up traders who made the value fluctuate again?
I'm exaggerating and in a way, mocking the recent price fluctuations. Don't be fooled though. I do own BTC and I'm not the one to panic sell despite the fluctuations from last week BUT... I can predict exactly what's gonna happen with BTC: it will peak and... stabilize. Seriously, those of you afraid that it will peak and then drop, fear not. As soon as  no more bitcoin is left to be mined (as per the original algorithm), the bitcoin will stop seeing these price fluctuations because the total amount of bitcoin will also be stable. Now, much of the fluctuations are pushes and pulls of fiat currency "entering the system" through the purchase of mined bitcoin (which was created well... out of nothing, as is the concept of mining). The good news? If my prediction is correct, and if the predictions of reaching the mining limit are correct: the price will go **WAY** up before it stabilizes. My best guess would be at least 5 grand.
P.S. The predictions of when will we reach the mining limit are probably waaaay off since they did not originally account for the massive mining hardware we're about to see in action...
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:26:58
Look, the only reason people are calling bitcoin a scam *at the moment* is due to the fact that right now it's an amazing investment oportunity because we're early adopters, etc. The point is... bitcoin **will** stabilize at some point, you can take my word for it.
Much of the current instability (n.b. I'm talking about the growth we keep experiencing) is due to the continuous influx of adopters who keep injecting fiat money through the purchase of bitcoins. Another important factor is mining, which will at some point in the future change radically. As soon as we hit the cap for bitcoin count (which we will, as it is part of the original spec.), the generation of bitcoin will become much slower, as miners will only be receiving the transaction fees but will effectively not be mining more bitcoins into existence.
As soon as bitcoin reaches a larger scale of mainstream and as soon as we hit that cap, my prediction is that it will stabilize and then two things will happen: 1) it will still have all its inherent benefits (low cost transactions across the globe, anonymity) and 2) because it will grow into a fiat currency-like stability (USD, EUR, CNY, etc currently don't grow even close to BTC) people will lose this bigoted view that it's a scam and will finally just accept it as the next best thing since sliced bread.
