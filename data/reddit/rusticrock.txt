if the B is tilted backwards, like its leaning back and relaxing its BCH
if the B is leaning forward like it just tripped and is falling flat on its face then its BTC
also, I got passed on the PA turnpike by an Audi R8 that had a giant BTC logo on the doors like it was its race number, made me chuckle, wish I had gotten pics of it but he was doing about 75mph and I was already pushing my old 04 SD with 39.5" tires to the limit just to maintain 70mph...I wasnt chasing him lol

If you have to ask if something is a scam because it sounds too good to be true....its a scam

I got this email yesterday, the funny thing is I dont have a Poloniex account with this email address and ofc it sounded too good to be true so I didnt click any links or anything from the email, but I wanted to warn others not to fall for this.  I also thought the sender email look suspicious as well.
