I do not believe so at the moment, I think it is only push-based from Eclair for now.

Hi there, mind giving me the channel point (or pm if you want it private) ? I can let you know what the deal is.

Hi everyone!
Skyrus is a dedicated node to provide liquidity and other lightning payment tools. Now with a mainnet wallet released, you can begin establishing real payment channels to nodes on the network such as mine. Here is a simple guide to begin creating channels to Skyrus via eclair:
First you will need to fund the wallet like any other bitcoin wallet.
1. Swipe to the leftmost tab in Eclair ("Your Bitcoin Address")
2. There you can see the bitcoin address and can fund it in all of the familiar ways
Once a payment is confirmed, now you can begin creating channels:
1. Visit [skyrus.net]( to find the node URI
2. In the eclair app, swipe to the rightmost tab ("Lightning Channels")
3. Press "Scan a Node URI" and scan the QR code on the site.
4. Type in the channel capacity you would like to fund with. (All lightning software is new and you should be careful not to fund too much!!)
Once the channel funding transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you can begin making micropayments. Channels you open with Skyrus will be long lasting as the node will be in service indefinitely and I work hard to keep it smooth sailing. This means you will be able to make very cheap payments even in times of high bitcoin onchain fees.
Of course feel free to ask me for any other questions regarding my service or the lightning network in general!
