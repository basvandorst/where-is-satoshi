I went to r/cryptocurrencies to post exactly this.
Where can one find sensible discussion about  BTC? Then figured before that, I'd give this sub a go.
We all love a good meme. But I'd primarily like to hear about BTC development, the roadmap, lightning network, ideas on fees and scaling etc etc.
Without this, BTC is likely to get surpassed by many others who are having this discussion. If that's natural so be it. But it'd be a real shame fall away because everyone was too busy jerking each other off.
I'm not a developer and I don't profess to be, but this sub could (should?) be about more than just the price.

Heard people discussing bitcoin in a very very rural pub in England yesterday. 
Crypto knowledge (or awareness) is spreading. 
Person 
1) - My son nearly bought some in 2016
2) - yeah mine too but it is too expensive
Then general chit chat. 
Honestly the overall impression was positive, i.e a way to make money, but they didn't realise you could buy a fraction. 
I didn't interject, because this is England.

I've only recently been to places where there is an abundance of energy.
First time I'd ever seen it and it blew my mind. Heating on, windows open, lights everywhere. So I see your point!

The power usage.

* send small amount first back and forth
* deposit balance onto hardware wallet and store it and back up keys somewhere safe (but seperate?
Thanks for your help

Is it correct that MEW allows on screen verification? I've only ever used the chrome app. If so great I'll use MEW.
It's not a huge concern as I have a working receive address but for new people it is a concern. Anything that undermines security is bad for the whole space.

Which does not exist for ETH addresses....
