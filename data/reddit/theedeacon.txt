Front end and back end between my buddy and I we are looking for a project to work on also. We ate interested in bitcoins, also.

Okay, so in the future, would some of these never get to be verified if there are millions of transactions going on per second?

So, in reality, there are fees with this payment type, no different than visa and mastercard.  And what's worse, the less fee you have, the longer your transaction is going to take to be processed?

In another sub it would just be a gay joke.

How does this motivate transaction confirmers?  Is the technology there to keep the cost of it down to cause people to want to mine?  I'm sure there will be people who do it just to support the technology, but as a person who is only confirming for the money, I don't see this being viable as the confirming gets more difficult, every two weeks (again, correct me if I'm confusing the two)

How did this happen?

Should never post something like that on reddit. Lol

Great explanation. Now I have to look into setting up a wallet or two so I can invest in some and then set up another so that I can tip you! I think this explanation will tip the scales for my wife.

Why are people searching us dollar?  People are searching for things they don't know about...  This is a gimme

So difficulty is determined by the amount of computers in all the pools?  
You referring to people with asics are now better off, because cpu/gpu doesn't have a great return compared with the new/newer devices?
I've been reading here and other places as well.  I started mining not to long ago, and every time I would come back from the weekend there would be an issue and my error log would be full.  I was getting like 22 mhash I believe -- so I knew I wasn't doing much of anything, just wanted to contribute.
I think it's all a very cool idea and hope it works out.  I'm asking all these questions as I have a wife and friend that fire back some of these questions at me and I'm not prepared.  I know this place is a good resource!
Thanks for all of your answers. I really appreciate it.

I was reading about some places doing it on a percentage.  I also read that there as a flat .005 or .0005 so as to not be free that most charge.
Do some retailers decide on a percentage?  That isn't mandatory... from what I understand, right?
