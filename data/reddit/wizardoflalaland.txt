I wonder if we are seeing the beginning of the end for the petrodollar. During the Nixon administration (I think), after Europeans started smarting up and demanding that their dollars be traded for gold, the Nixon administration halted the gold standard. The U.S. managed to support the dollars afterwards by making a deal with Saudi Arabia to only denominate oil sales in USD. I wonder if we are seeing the beginning of the collapse of the petro-dollar system.
@_date: 2016-04-16 23:54:44
If tomorrow oil stopped being denominated in dollars, external demand for dollars would decrease significantly. The result would be that the government would not be able to export inflation, and a lot of the dollars that are outside would come back to the United States. Might lead to hyperinflation. It would not be that difficult to find an alternative store of value at that point, although everyday trade would still be conducted in dollars.

If we all knew this answer to this question, we would all be rich. Markets are unpredictable. Assess your own risk tolerance and make a decision.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:02:09


If you want to buy something in anonymity, then bitcoin is a great way to do it. You can also pay for shadow/illegal goods/services anonymously. For example, if you wanted to buy porn, for example webcam porn, and not have a porn transaction be recorded or traceable to your name, you could use bitcoin. Imagine that you are a normal 16 year old male, who watches porn but doesn't have the ability to pay for it because of his age. Now he can. Bitcoin could also be used for drugs, gambling, unprescribed medical goods, etc. Bitcoin can be method to conduct transactions that your government or society deems inappropriate. 


Speculation, potential upside is a risk some would choose to bear. Cryptocurrency can also be very valuable in hedging against capital restrictions and political risk, allowing cash to move between areas with extreme capital controls. Its easy for someone from the United States to say that they are not scared of their banks, 


It should be noted that as of right now, the bitcoin network would not be able to handle retail consumer transactions, as it can only process roughly 7 transactions per second. If transaction processing improves enough, which I think it will, and a merchant ecosystem develops, third parties or companies could provide some of these services to consumers.

You are right. I don't plan on selling. The only thing that could cause me to sell is either a structural, exploitable flaw in the payment protocol or a superior cryptocurrency emerging independently of Bitcoin. Ultimately, I don't think China will be able to significantly hamper Bitcoin growth in the (very) long run, although I think that Bitcoin is going to take some hard hits along the way. I am happy to increase my position at this point.

@_date: 2014-04-12 06:13:13
The dollar is used as a stable store of value in Argentina. Bitcoin is either a speculative investment or a means to do instant transfers anonymously over the internet. They are pretty different animals. Nevertheless, I agree with OPs regarding what China is doing: China obviously won't say that they are banning bitcoin, but they are taking every step to make it more difficult to use within China.

Damn, I just got common sensed. Nvm.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:36:24
Yeah, I was actually going to make a post about this. Higher sales equals higher supply for sale equals lower equilibrium price. Spending could very well be driving the price down. If this was the sole cause of price decrease, I would probably say that it is a positive sign long term. 
However, there could also be other factors, such as the dumping of stolen coins (Mt Gox and the ones from SR2 are probably still being dumped), in addition to the China talk. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:44:26
This could be huge. I am scared its a scam and that you can't trust them with your bitcoins, especially as they are a Chinese company. I am not the type to say this easily, but I would cry if this were true.

I'm really sad that there is a technical problem with the software preventing me from synching with the network (I downloaded the full blockchain in around 10 hours 3 months ago, and I synced fine) that prevents me from running the full node. I really refuse to use online wallet as I have no reason to trust Blockchain or Electrum, I will probably find a way to move my full client wallet to an SPV if I can't solve the problem with the full client.

Factors that could be contributing to selling:
- Increased sales to retailers means that more retailers are going to be selling, therefore driving the supply up and the price down.
- Stolen coins from Mt. Gox and Silkroad 2 may still be being dumped.
- Short term traders who buy high and sell low.

According to Rand, because in some cases, donating their product makes them happier. If there is return, utility wise, to an individual being charitable, Ayn Rand would not say that that is illogical. There are many instances were being charitable offers or grants benefits to the donator. What she would say is that it is illogical/immoral being forced to give away your work, or being enslaved part time, to pay for others' wages and or help.  Saying that labor is equivalent to a portion of your life time is a correct interpretation of Rand, but saying that this leads to the conclusion that all giving away is a "sin" does not seem, to me, like a correct representation of Rand. Rand said that truly altruistic giving is morally wrong. She believed that there was such a thing such as purely altruistic intentions.

I agree that Atlas Shrugged sucks, but I don't think you are evaluating Rand fairly or accurately, as someone who read her more "philosophical" books and sympathize with her on some things (not all things). I mean, if someone does not know how to think critically, a book like "The Virtue of Selfishness" can lead to more critical thinking than any reading or work you learn in a high school curriculum. The fact that you are considering a point of view that goes almost completely against everything society tells you, and somethings people find repugnant, should be something that opens minds to new ideas and questioning of old ones, she always says "Always question the premises upon which an argument is based" and discourages bandwagon jumping. You may not agree with everything she says, but I think calling it a work for those who can't think critically may not be accurate.
There are a number of things that are just flat out incorrect here about how you portray Rand.


You should keep in mind that Rand falsely thought that people were capable of acting absolutely altruistically, which I think is false. Most humans will engage in "altrusitic behavior" out of expectation of future benefit or because helping people makes them feel good. Ayn Rand acknowledged that helping someone because it helps you is not in any way a sin. 


I agree with you here. 


I don't think that Ayn Rand advocated judging people on a purely market value basis. I would like to see the source for this.

Careful guys, there is a discrepancy between the value of the peso traded on the street and as the Argentinian government sells it. The dollar is worth around 6.5 argentinian pesos on the street, but the government lists it as ~4.5. This is becuase the Argentinian government limits the amount of dollars available to the public. Keep this in mind when buying and selling bitcoins.

Extreme volatility and an uncertain regulatory environment. Also, very few merchants accept it currently although the number of merchants is growing. It is also used to trade illegal goods (drugs, child porn, guns).
I am not sure about Bitcoin specifically, but I think cryptocurrencies are the future, and eventually, the government and large businesses will need to get in bed with them. The question is whether Bitcoin is the MySpace of cryptocurrencies or the Facebook of cryptocurrencies.

I think calling it an investment makes sense. 
Definition of investment: an amount of money invested in something for the purpose of making a profit. 
This is correct of most owners of Bitcoin.
Definition of gambling: the practice of playing games of chance or betting in the hope of winning money
If you think that Bitcoin is a game of chance, then it is also gambling. 
Gambling and investing are not mutually exclusive. We should acknowledge that Bitcoin as an investment lowered in value because of what happened in China.

I agree with you that speculation is probably the biggest reason for transacting in bitcoin. But buying and selling of goods and services, the majority, I believe is illegal activity. I think the fundamental strength of Bitcoin, right now, is being able to transact anonymously. One of the advantages of Bitcoin is how easily it allows one to break the law.

Do you have any empirical data backing this up? You may be correct, but I have seen too much examples of Eastern civil disobedience to automatically believe this statement is true. (Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines, Laos, Bangladesh, Hong Kong) are a few that come to mind, if you count the Middle East as "the East", then civil disobedience occurs there at a mass scale. The last I saw of actual civil disobedience in the US was the Occupy clowns. Maybe South America has a higher record of civil disobedience, but to say that the whole West has more, I would need some empirical data.

Yeah, they would probably just buy them.

Looking at it as a piggy bank at this point seems inaccurate, it is more of an intermediate currency (buying bitcoins so someone else can quickly resell them as dollars). I hope the price drops further, I am not going to buy at $100. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:55:49
Honestly, normally I would tell people to hold bitcoin in the long run, but if you bought at any level below the current price I would say sell a significant portion now and prepare for a drop in price. It is obvious this is a bubble. There may even be some few smart asses trying to make a lot of money out of this, don't let them take the profit before you. Now is the perfect time to sell, bitcoin is way overvalued. Do you want to miss out on the profit so someone else doesn't? If you are the type that bought bitcoin because you support the idea, then don't let the price keep appreciating like this. Sell now and make a profit before it comes crashing down. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:50:40

The question is whether the volatility premium we will have to pay will be small enough to encourage buying in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:52:59
Maybe they are just scared of FINCEN or authorities getting on their asses and cutting their profits with lawsuits. If they were free to do whatever they want, they would probably use Bitcoin in a very risky and speculative fashion.

I want to get in now but I want a lower price...
@_date: 2013-01-30 06:14:13
That is what everyone who is currently holding would want. It is difficult to asses whether Bitcoin is adequately valued now as I have a very weak understanding of the technical aspects of Bitcoin and cannot see a lot of economic research and statistics surrounding it. I was intending to buy when the coin was at 5.5, but I didn't. 
Anyone here have statistics on Silkroad growth over the last few months? Silkroad growth is the only thing I feel would increase demand in the long run. I think lots of people might be getting in because of the rising price= bubble. However, all my claims are unsubstantiated, because I have very little knowledge on how to adequately gauge the value of a bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-29 23:47:44


I don't believe this is happening either, I just want people to consider the possibility. Certain agencies may be centrally aware of this, like the DEA. I think that there is a significant possibility of unofficial anonymous selling of seized drugs for bitcoin by people linked to these agencies. Selling seized drugs seems like to much of a profit incentive for someone to ignore. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:03:51

@_date: 2013-02-28 16:25:08
I don't understand how the future value of Bitcoin can be rising so fast, I think that maybe the movement up might be from simply new speculators entering the market... in all honesty, I think that the best indicator that should be used to determine whether this is a bubble or not is whether silkroad sales have been growing at equal proportion... also, I think that if any of the recent attempts at marijuana legalization pass in some states, this could highly hurt bitcoins future outlook as silkroad sales could decrease. But then again, it is totally arbitrary. 
I am also not sure whether the market is acting rationally here. There is extremely little solid economic data except user posted news that could be by people who want the value to rise. I would think that if the market were acting rationally many people would be psychologically pressured to cash out now rather than face the extreme uncertainty of their investment. I think this is a classical case of people buying due to an increase in price. As an investment, Bitcoin is currently destroying the best of mainstream investments. I think that the price will go up for at least a few more months until we see the bubble burst.
