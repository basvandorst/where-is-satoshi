I switched recently, it's improved a lot in basic search since the early days. There are certain classes of search which it seems to do better than Google.

The market impact is already built into the exchange price when miners sell directly.

So Google is finally catching up to Bing?
That was an odd sentence to type.

I've seen it happen a lot of times where the extra stubborn Wikipedia editor won't even allow mention that there's anyone who disagrees with them. Because then somebody reading the article might not join his side!

Make the usual economic assumptions.
If the miner places his coin on a public exchange, the price will drop when they coins enter the market, and then rise again as they leave the market. The final price will be slightly less than it was before because demand has dropped.
If the miner sells his coins privately, there is no price drop on the market while he's seeking to sell, but then there is no price rise after he does sell them. He still fulfilled market demand, however, so the demand drops causing the overall price to also drop slightly.
This is what I mean when I say the impact is built in. The supply side of the equation is a wash.
