Forbes as in the current ceo, likely the son. I am 99% sure he has a son currently ceo whose last name is forbes.

Some memes are ok, but I would honestly like to see some more text posts with focus on bitcoin and whats going on, instead of seeing a front page filled with 80% pictures

Honestly I can see myself in the future, feeling missed out, because I was too worried of buying at $4000

Yeah, I used to think this was all just a joke, play money. Just a manipulated bubble. Forgot about it for a long time. Coming back and seeing all that has happened, I was obviously wrong.

I want to buy some bitcoin, but everybody on this subreddit only has bad things to say about coinbase, but my friends say coinbase is the best one to use

I will never understand how a billionaire like forbes allows such uninformed and misguided "journalists" to publish articles on his site.

It looks like they are saying they will insure hacked coins that were breached because of them. If your specific account got hacked, they won't cover it. But honestly who knows if they even could insure a cold storage hack.

Sounds awesome I wish I could do that :D
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:44:33
Yeah I have always wondered about this as well

So all this negative view on Coinbase is mostly just impatience and low customer support resources?

So you just hodl (which i think means hold?) through all the volatility?
