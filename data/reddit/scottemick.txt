Registration as an exchange (which he was not) is completely separate from paying capital gains taxes.  He is required to pay capital gains tax regardless of his status as an MSB or an investor.

All I see in the article is sovereign currency used to support questionable activities, nothing about bitcoin whatsoever.  So why did the article mention it at all?  Government mentions bitcoin at any chance given whether or not it was actually used.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:40
Exactly, file and pay your taxes.  Register as an MSB if you are one.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:25:00
If he was a tax cheat that is what he should have been prosecuted for, not some laws he didn't break.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:28:21
His business was registered as an LLC.  I'm not privy to weather he paid taxes properly.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:07
Trading bitcoins still doesn't require a registration and no license exists.  Only running an exchange requires registration as a money transmitter.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:19:46
Once again the government punishes a bitcoin trader for something he isn't required to do by law. There is no license for buying and selling bitcoin.  There is only a money transmitter license.  The simple sales and purchases of bitcoin are not money transmission per 31CFR.  Only exchanges which allow customers to trade back and forth engage in is money transmission.  This is a gross miscarraige of justice that a judge and prosecutor can distort the law to however they see fit with no repercussions.  The Fincen Guidence also reiterates that simple sales and purchases are exempt while exchanges are not.  The fact that they ignored this as well is deeply troubling.  The rule of law in this country is in great peril.  (I myself registered with Fincen even though I don't transmit money)

I run core on a dedicated server on a Gigabit fiber connection....Still doesn't help the unconfirmed transactions and the ridiculous fees.  We need every service provider and wallet to start using the new segwit addresses!

The transaction originated from Genesis Trading in NYC (secondmarket)

In your opinion, which are the most competent, and why?
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:26:19
I talked with Genesis Trading, they didn't change anything...This transaction is the same as the previous 50 from them that I sent to bitstamp...And I never heard from bitstamp support yet, they broke something or got hacked I would presume by the lack of response.

Finally! My deposit was accepted.  Such a relief.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:07:28
Transfer is not instant.  Often times the first notification shows up in seconds, but sometimes it can take a couple minutes.  If you sent the coin from bitstamp, see my post about deposits being halted.

I wire money all the time with USAA to buy bitcoins...That's interesting...How much were you wiring?  maybe because I only do 2000-3000 at a time?
@_date: 2014-11-07 07:34:52
sorry for crossposting.
I'm one of the mid sized sellers on locabitcoins and in association with some of the largest pro-traders on locabitcoins. You are going to need a lot more transparency about your company before we trust you with the large sums of money (30 - 300 coins) that we store at any given time on a site. You have to understand the number of fake websites and fly-by-night companies that we have dealt with over the years.  I would like to know 
1) who owns the company?  
2) Is is public or private?  Where is the company registered that we can verify with Canadian and/or provincial authorities?  For instance my business is registered in Ohio and can be verified on the website by going to  and searching for EUCLID FRIENDLY COMPUTER SERVICE.   Here you will find my business registry number   
3) Are you registered with FINTRAC and where can we verify this information?  I have recently registered with FinCen here in the USA.  You can search for my company on the site and find it there. 
4) I would like to see ardeva tokens for some of the principals of the company to know you track back to real people so when our bitcoins go missing, we have some idea where to find you.  This is my ardeva token:   They do not release your private information unless you have committed a crime or breach of contract, but they are a trusted third party you can prove your identity to.
Thus far I cannot find a registration on FINTRAC or Registraire des entreprises of Québec. 
Also your withdrawal fees are ridiculous.  The only fee for withdrawal for those who made sell or make purchases should be the minimum network requirement from bitcoin.  If you want to charge the wallet-only people fine.
I think these steps helping to prove your real-world identity would get you a flood of customers.  Right now there is relatively nothing for us to go on.  The entire site could be a big trap.

Yes I used the new deposit details...And I did get my money the same day, I was very happy....They were delayed for some reason...Instead of 7am their time, I got it at the end of day, their time, which was still plenty early my time...(I think by lunch time?)
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:22:41
Those of us simply buying and selling bitcoin as an investment on Localbitcoins should not be subject to reserve requirements.  We only buy bitcoin, hold our own bitcoin, and sell that bitcoin to others.  We do not store bitcoin for others in wallets like a web wallet or exchange. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:29:49
Consumers buying goods with bitcoin, merchants accepting bitcoin for payment, tipping, and other simple activities should NOT be licensed at all.  Are you going to require all credit card users to get a license?  Are all the merchants that accept credit cards going to need a license?  Requirements for simple consumers and merchants are absurd.
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:59:18
I did get an email confirmation.
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:22:10
The establishments do not accept bitcoin for alcohol. If the establishment uses coinbase for example, then coinbase translates the bitcoins into fiat currency that is deposited into the merchant's account, and thus, the merchant is not accepting bitcoin directly for alcohol.
Now if the merchant simply accepts bitcoin straight into his wallet for alcoholic beverages, then yes, he is accepting bitcoin for alcohol. 
I recommend the establishments sell giftcards for the time being for coinbase bitcoins (usd fiat).  This will alleviate the problem.
Furthermore, the liquor control board has no say in what is allowed as payment from a customer as that is purely a federal matter and not within it's authority to regulate.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:10:45
subsequent response from them and my reply.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:48:48
Coinbase pays with USD.  Visa pays with USD. You're telling me VISA needs a liquor license?  And by the same token the Federal Reserve which issues bank notes needs a liquor license?  Wow we've been missing out on a whole lot of revenue here.
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:49:52
I might check out bitfinex too....A bit hard to figure out the verification for a sole proprietorship though.  Bitstamp was very easy for me to get a corporate account on. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:24:38
Also for those of us on Localbitcoins, we are not transmitters either because we do not send virtual currency to 3rd parties.  We only engage the customer as a seller directly to sell our goods...Or engage the seller directly as a customer to buy our goods.  So to declare us as MSB's is going to far and untrue.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:01:49
The response I received for my order: (and my reply).
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:20:47
The regulations are far over reaching, punitive, and anti-american, anti-capitalist.  They are designed to punish people involved with bitcoin for the benefit of the banksters and other powerful corporations that feel threatened by bitcoin.

I have wired many times from Navy Fed....The names match....The wire has not been rejected.   Kraken support asked me for my ticket# on here yesterday and I haven't heard from them since.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:27:04
Sent the wire from my own account...thanks for the info
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:56:15
I've never had major problems either.....I hope they find this simple wire transfer.
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:35:28
Thanks I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:10:48
This isn't on the wire instructions on the website.  I have a direct account# with evolve that is my own.
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:52:30
I have to say, once I got the support that monitors Reddit, things started moving quite smoothly.  I did get contacted by Evolve Bank and Trust yesterday, she claims that the fedwire transaction id for the $250 I received and my transaction id were duplicates, so I was credited with the first transaction.  Somehow my account# was associated with both transactions.  This sounds like a corrupted file to me, or a bug in programming. The second amount, my $14,445 wasn't applied to anyone's account.  Synapse pay is still being used as the processor to update kraken on money sent to evolve bank and trust.  I think synapse pay probably also does some AML and compliance pieces for kraken to augment their own AML/KYC.    
Evolve is supposed to do a fix on Tuesday to get me my money and send the $250 where it belongs to also.  I'm happy that it wasn't a hack and my money sent elsewhere, or some government seizure though I have done nothing to warrant that.

Woodforest or Wells Fargo is ripping you....ACH withdrawals from coinbase go in that day's ach batch.  They come in your banks next morning's ach batch a few hours later.  USAA, Navy Fed, and most other banks that give instant ACH credit post that deposit immediately.

# Fiat currency deposit references
For most fiat currency deposit methods, you'll see a unique deposit reference included with the deposit instructions. This deposit reference is very **important** and needs to be included in your bank transfer.
The format of the deposit reference may vary based on the chosen deposit method.
**Note**: No deposit reference is required for [**US domestic FedWire/ACH transfer**]( deposit method.  
\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^ This is the method I used \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^  
each customer is given a unique account# at evolve bank and trust, thus no reference# needed.

I've decided to blog my inquiries with Fincen which will be both email and soon, certified letters until I get full clarification of this.  Either the law is the law and the rules are the rules, or they are not.  I want answers.
more to come!!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:20:29
I added this to my blog today...A determination by a former fincen worker that I was not an MSB.  Key Bank had me sign an affidavit after they saw I was registered as a money transmitter.  I had to explain that was the only way I could register as Fincen did not have the VCB category like Canada does.  Keybank just wanted to make sure I wasn't actually going to open a company to compete with Western Union.
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:26:48
Synapse pay has still not credited my account.  I keep hearing the same thing from Kraken.  The wire processor (synapse pay) mixed up the deposits and hope to have it fixed soon.  But it never gets fixed.
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:16:01
Does anyone think it is acceptable to lose/misplace/misuse/? a customers money for this length of time? Especially when the bank found that they received the money and my account was not credited.  Should I be contacting an attorney, filing a cfpb complaint, filing an fbi complaint, ?

My money is still nowhere to be found.     No one called me back on Tuesday as promised.   The money is not in my account Tuesday as promised.  This is dreadful.  I talked to someone yesterday who said Kraken (synapse pay) lost his money for weeks....
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:05:43
1/2 the day is through and nothing yet.  Supposedly the file from fedwire was corrupt which is how I got credited the $250 instead of $14,445.  The programming was supposed to be fixed to day or the file corrected.  Meanwhile I missed out on buying.  I hope yet to get credit today.

Finally one day short of three weeks I got my deposit!!! This was a very scary ordeal to go through.  I'm glad it wasn't on a 90K wire and glad this wasn't a collapse or a bankruptcy.  Still, nearly 3 weeks is unacceptable to deposit and credit money.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:24:56
They say "2 to 5 day" to give themselves leeway...The reason it takes time is the KYC stuff they have to figure out where the wire came from and that it matches the person or companies name, etc. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:32:28
I'll be sending my wires to Bitfinex or 2nd Market.  Most of us do not have the ability to specify the intermediary bank to use.  This is costing me a lot of money having my funds tied up for a long period of time. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:03:38
So if we could rename this thread it would be "Standard Chartered are assholes, start rejecting wires for bitstamp."
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:48:47
My BOA wire was sent yesterday at 0600 am eastern time and reported sent &amp; received by Raffeisin Bank at 0615am, but no credit so far by Bitstamp.  I opened a ticket this morning at 6am and no response all day from support.  Either there is a problem at bitstamp or a problem sending US wires.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:12:26
Now if it is actually a Sanctions thing with Ukraine/Russia, it would have been nice to see a notice on the OFAC website, or in the news, or something.  And if it is sanctions, then it won't matter what intermediary bank is used.  US Banks will block it at the source if they see Raiffeisen Bank.  The secret banks, secret police, and secret government are annoying, costly, and dangerous.  We need transparency and democracy back.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:35:11
I think the "sanctions" are an internal policy made by standard chartered.  I should sue them for my wire fees they caused me to waste and lost time.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:06:53
I called BOA wired dept and BOA business online escalations and they told me there is no way to pick the intermediary/correspondent bank oven over the phone or in the branch.  I don't know if that's true, but that's what 2 different people have told me so far.  I think BOA either has to have a direct relationship or for USD wires to europe it is going to have to go through standard chartered.  
So, I have no choice but to go to BitFinex or 2nd Market.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:23:42
In general they process them the same day or at least by the next day.  The wire itself is nearly instant.  The problem is many customers are getting their wires returned and we are not sure why.  Has the US government added Raiffesin to the OFAC list?  I don't see it there...My wire was not returned but I sent it very early yesterday morning with BOA.  Or it could be returned sitting in a queue at BOA somewhere.  I don't want to call because last time I called BOA about a wire for bitstamp it caused more problems than it was worth.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:33:30
BOA checked and the wire was rejected by Standard Chartered Bank, assholes.  Since I have no way to specify an intermediate/correspondant, I cannot wire to Bitstamp any more.
