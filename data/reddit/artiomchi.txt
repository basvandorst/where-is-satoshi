Not at the moment, no.. The BIP0038 code there uses non EC multiply mode. If there's enough interest, then I can help Canton put in a BIP0038 generator that uses an existing intermediate code as well.
I can definitely see the benefit of having that functionality in - if you already have an intermediate code - you can safely use the website to print secure paper wallets on a completely open, online-connected and even infected machine, since having the intermediate code you're not actually disclosing the passkey!
- what do you think?
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:12:06
Well, what would you suggest?
Having a page in the web browser means you can open it up, and see for yourself what the code does. Even if you don't know that, the code is freely available on GitHub, and is being peer-reviewed all the time. You can download the latest version from there, and just run it locally on ANY computer.
If you needed a compiled app to do that, there's the issue of trust (you have to trust the person that compiled the code to not have changed the source), or you have to have enough knowledge on how to compile it yourself, if you're getting it from GitHub.
At this point, having the page in HTML is, really, the most obvious choice
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:04:16
That's actually a great idea! Just make sure your passkey is secure enough (preferably I tend to use non ASCII characters there, to secure your passkey), but I might do the same, if this feature is implemented :)

@_date: 2014-01-23 12:32:47
They don't actually.. The key is BIP0038 encrypted, using EC multiply.  
You, the client, come up with a password, and generate an *intermediate key* that you pass on to a company. They don't have your passkey, just the intermediate key, that they use to generate wallet addresses and **encrypted** private keys. They can't get the private key itself, since they don't have the passkey, but when the cards arrive, you can use your passkey to decrypt the private keys.
Many apps (like Mycelium) have support for that out of the box, so when you scan an encrypted private key it will prompt you for a password, making this a secure, safe and easy way of storing your offline wallets!
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:35:30
They how did they withdraw the coins? Shouldn't 2fa prevent that, requiring a unique generated answer every time?
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:47:00
Sounds like a nice idea, but unfortunately I found the implementation rather poor.
My main gripe with it was the way you verify the hotspot.. I could find a new hotspot, add it to the map (connect to it), but when I click to verify it - the app disconnects me from it, and attempts to reconnect. A lot of the time it would then come up with an error message, because it can't connect to the internet. My phone would then successfully connect to the wireless network, but it would be too late at this point.
After several attempts, the app would just say that I already tried to verify this hotspot, and not allow me to do that anymore.. ? How come?
Also, the interface.. A lot of the time it's unintuitive, and some places just lack responsiveness or progress updates. One of the hotspots I was trying to add was overloaded (it was during a conference), and the internet was slow. I go to add a new hotspot, enter the details, press "Create"..... and nothing happens.. Press it again - nothing.. Cancel, and start from the beginning - same result. I couldn't add the hotspot in the end. Only later did I realise that it was probably just waiting for a response from the server, but not displaying that in the interface.
Also, in explorer mode, there's a button that shows the hotspots as a list. That's nice and useful, but it displays their name, but not the Wifi name.. Some places would have multiple open hotspots (a couple from different mobile providers, for example, in shopping malls).. Looking at that list it's impossible to know which one is what.
On the map view, you might have multiple hotspots on the same address.. You'd have multiple "pins" overlaying over each other, but no way to switch between them. If you tap on one, you'll see the hotspot name in the bottom of the screen.. I'd love it if I could swipe right-left to switch between hotspots in the current location / same address..
That's the ones out of the top of my head..
Cool app, and very nice concept.. But the app needs some work.

You can also see that MOST of those transactions were 0-5 sat/B
Looks to me like low cost spam transactions, if anything. Nobody would reasonably send a transaction with that fee and then complain that it's not processed (at least at the moment)
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:03:11
So.. Here's a question then. Say we have a channel between Alice and Bob, who both put in 0.5 BTC, and the channel is worth 1 BTC.
At some point, after a bunch of transactions, they both get back to 0.5 BTC each. The way it was explained, they can close the channel at any point in time, by sending the last transaction state to the blockchain.
1) Do both parties have to be online to close the channel? I'm assuming each party can close the channel independently, at any point in time, right?
2) If that's the case, what stops Bob from backing up his wallet (say, using something like Titanium Backup on Android), buying something from Alice for 0.5 BTC, receiving the goods, then restore his wallet to the last backed up state, and sending that state to the blockchain?  
Alice's wallet will tell her she has 1 BTC, and Bob has none, but at this point, Bob already closed the channel, and sent the transaction to the network. By the time Alice gets back online and notices this, the channel will be long closed, and could have multiple confirmations.
3) If both parties have to be online on the other hand (unlikely), what stops Bob from buying something from Alice, paying for it and throwing his phone in the ocean? :P  
Sure, he loses his initial 0.5 BTC, but at this point he should have none anyway. It would prevent Alice from getting her money though.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:07:00
I've just converted my BCH to BTC yesterday. I just wish I did this sooner :)
I used Kraken - never had a problem with them, very pleased. You'll need to wait for 20 confirmations for your BCH deposit, but it only took several hours.

I'd love for a chance to test my raspbian running a Lightning wallet!
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:38:38
1. That's why it's in beta :) These are problems that have to be solved
2. Lighting is an off chain network. The only place where the channel data is stored (as far as I know, I haven't read the spec) is on the devices of the two parties (until they close the channel). 
 So if you did lose your device and are restoring from an older backup, you may lose some transaction data. At which point you have to trust the other party.
 But you don't have to tell the other party how much of the history of the channel you have. 
 For example, the channel had 10 transactions made. Your backup only has a record of 5 transactions. You ask the other party for a copy of the channel ledger, and they send you all 10 and everyone's happy.
 If the other party tries to cheat you, they can send an older version of the ledger. For example they pretend that the last transaction is transaction number 5. Since your backup has more transactions than that, either both parties had a catastrophic data loss at the same time (unlikely), or they're trying to scam you. In which case you know the other party is lying, and this can be handled accordingly.
Again - it's not all perfect - it's a work in progress :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:58:01
Not sure why you're being downvoted - this is exactly the correct answer in this scenario - if you have an old backup that you're restoring, your software should first do it's best effort if it's current channel state is out of date, and "fast forward" to the latest transaction before trying to close the channel.

@_date: 2017-09-01 08:55:59
That shouldn't really affect them anyway, should it?
They can always update the firmware to support the forks - that's what happened with BCH - it was available in beta for some time, same with SegWit now. 
So there's no point in delaying the device launch just because of that
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:06:10

I didn't say that Qt is non existent on Windows, just that it's non standard.

True, but you can just as easily run your own local electrum server. This way you have the blockchain locally, while also using a simple, light client.
Why, you'd ask? Well, for example because the Electrum client looks simpler to use, and uses a LOT less disk space :)
Then again, it's missing a bunch of functionality (I can't see anywhere where you could specify where you're sending the money from.. Seems like Electrum will just pick an address that it likes, and I'm not sure I like that...

Second of all - you are mistaken.. In Multibit each wallet is stored in a separate file, each can be individually encrypted (and as you mentioned, if a wallet is encrypted, a little lock is shown next to that wallet).
But each wallet can contain multiple individual addresses, and you can have multiple wallets that have the same address, and each wallet may have multiple unique addresses each.
Just to prove you wrong - here's a screenshot of MultiBit with multiple wallets in the app.. The selected wallet ("MultiBit Wallet") has 7 different addresses in it, each can be used to send or receive coins.
If you look above the address list, there's a "New" button to generate new addresses to be kept within this wallet file.

Ah, now magnet links make a massive difference!
I admit I haven't read the spec in details, I just didn't like the idea from the very beginning.. Magnet links on the other hand make a massive difference, since they will basically allow you to distribute the data in a non centralised environment, with no need for a central server.
Something that can't really be achieved with regular URLs that can expire..
While I'm still not convinced on using the blockchain as storage for such data, I am taking back a number of my arguments that were invalid... Also, if I follow my logic - colored coins should be just as bad, so I guess it's not all that bad :)
Thanks a lot for taking the time, listening to my arguments, and explaining the parts that I missed!
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:07:23
Umm.. What? O_o
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:50:25
What you want to do is import the private key into your Multibit wallet..
You could of course take the private key, import that into MultiBit, and then use the money.. But that would mean a potentially compromised address (since someone else might have scanned the private key). 
If you want to do this anyway, you can create a .key file (call it paper.key, for example), and add the private key there, along with a timestamp of when the key was created.. If I remember correctly - that should do it. You can check the first transaction date on  (put the public address in the search bod there)...
I believe, you just need 1 line in that file:


You can avoid that trouble, and go to blockchain.info, create a wallet there, and import the key (go to your wallet on the site, "Import / Export" and put the key into the private key box). Then you can export the key, which will give you a file that MultiBit can import
BUT, a MUCH easier (and more correct) way to do that would be to sweep the coins from that wallet to your address.. 
Unfortunately, I don't believe MultiBit supports that, so I'd either use a mobile client to do that (Mycelium supports that), or import the paper wallet into  (see above), and then send it immediately to one of your addresses in MultiBit. 
This way you'll both get the coins, and not worry about giving the private key to a third party, since you'll take the coins from the paper wallet address immediately.
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:21:03
Hmm.. Yes, I see.. While it exists, it's far from the easiest way of doing it, especially since every other client can do it very elegantly.. I'm surprised it's implemented so poorly..

Well, according to the title of this post it stores data and metadata. And if you use the block chain to store the location of some data, like a URL - who can guarantee that this address, or even that hostname will be available years later?

What are you talking about? Multibit has wallets, each wallet can have multiple addresses.. You don't need to create a new wallet every time you want a new address!
You're most definitely wrong here!
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:16:20
So far that's the best short overview I've read in a while..
By the way.. What can Armory do that Electrum can not, and that makes it worth installing it, waiting hours for it to synchronise and letting it gorge on double the blockchain size in disk space?
P.S. In the chart you listed, isn't paper wallet almost the same (technically) as the 12 word seed feature, but with a slightly different implementation? If so, that would make the main difference between the two being only the blockchain location, no?
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:30:07
So you mean you want to provide a private key, and for the page to give you a BIP0038 encrypted paper wallet? Great idea! Working on it!
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:00:41
Hmm.. Well, Google doesn't store the data though, they just spider the sites, and provide links to the actual data.. It's more of an index rather than storage.. 
He did mention Google Drive.. This is closer, but at the same time, if Google finds out you store something like that on their storage - it will be deleted and/or your account may be banned.
Compared to that - the blockchain is *final*. Once something's added to it - it will stay there, and there's no way of removing it, without invalidating all the blocks created after it. And it would be spread around the world whether you want it or not.
Now sure, you have a very good point - the data, while present in the blockchain, can only be retrieved if you know it's there.. And if TSavo (or anyone else) kept the source private, and maybe even encrypted it - you'd never know it was there, unless you were looking specifically for it. Which would somewhat invalidate my point about prosecuting every person who holds the blockchain on their PCs :)
But I still believe that the approach he took is somewhat abusing the system
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:04:08
Also, looking at your bounty page - it's not even your code, that you claim to have paid for - is it not true that you used bitaddress.org source, and put your front on it, adding support for multiple designs? 
So far, I see your post only as an attempt at advertisement, to promote your site, and get more sales. Pure and simple 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:29:49
I think you're still going at it wrong..
I think what you want is a brain wallet sequence that will generate a BIP0038 encrypted private key, which can then be decrypted using a password...
So when you provide the brain wallet AND the password - you get a  decrypted private key, but if you only use the brain wallet - you get a encrypted key.
Unfortunately, I don't know enough about BIP0038 to say if that's possible or not in a simple way, but I do like the idea!
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:40:51
That's a terrible idea.. It will bloat the size of the blockchain, that's pretty large as it is.. Don't forget that the blockchain is about 14GB already (on my drive at least), if we start storing random data in the blockchain, it will make it a lot larger.. 
Firstly, it will mean that every user storing the blockchain will be storing these files.. While it's good for spreading the data, it will also potentially cause issues.. As stated in another comment, what if some of the data is "illegal" for whatever reason? Say, what if someone adds instructions to create explosives to the blockchain.. Or some child pornography? Every user will have that stored on their drive, and as such can be arrested.. Now that would be a big hit against bitcoin O_o
Also, if the blockchain will grow excessively large, more people will start using clients like Electrum, that don't store the whole blockchain, and use known servers to do that for them, since storing the blockchain, and processing it will take a lot of time and resources... (at the moment, synchronising from 0 took me about a day, where the second half of the day the CPU was running at close to 100% =/ )
If that happens, this will basically promote centralisation of the blockchain, which ruins the whole point of it.
I have nothing against your project, and it can create it's own alt chain to store and share the data, but I really hope any contribution like that to the bitcoin blockchain gets rejected.. HARD..

Oh yeah, you're absolutely right in some way.. But I don't think they'll go as far as declaring the blockchain illegal..
In your example you mentioned SatoshiDice. While it is gambling, and while it is illegal in a lot of places - the blockchain itself does not *directly* help them gamble - it's just a bitcoin transfer medium. By storing the blockchain you only store the ledger - the proof that they gambled, and you didn't help them in any way, you were just supporting the Bitcoin infrastructure. And you're only spreading the proof of their transactions across other nodes.
With money laundering - it's the same situation.
But if someone adds something like I described in my post (actual illegal data, like underage porn, instructions on how to build explosives), then by storing and spreading the blockchain, you're technically aiding in the distribution of pornography/illegal material, which can then cause a whole different can of worms.


Ok, you're completely correct there.. It's (mostly, except for the random seeds) not random at all.. What I meant to say is - if we start storing arbitrary data in the blockchain, completely unrelated to the transactions, and just use it as a storage medium - **this** will cause issues, and that's what I hope we will avoid.
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:57:24
I absolutely love [ generator, but it really lacks BIP 0038 support, in my opinion.. For example I'd love to create a paper wallet, and then print a copy of it and give it to my friend/brother for safe storage, while not worrying that someone might take the money off the wallet.
On the other hand, bitaddress.org has BIP0038 encryption, but lacks the nice foldable and sealable design of bitcoinpaperwallet.com
So I've took the encryption code from bitaddress.org, and merged it into the bitcoinpaperwallet.com code, and created a pull request.
If you want it to go live, please follow the link above and comment/vote on the issue so that it's merged into the main code/site

Well.. bitaddress.org is the original.. bitcoin paper wallet website is a fork of sorts of bitaddress, that had a LOT of it's functionality removed. If we really wanted a bitaddress.org that can use custom templates - we'd be better off rewriting the source of bitaddress 
I just wanted the extend the paper wallet site and restore the private key encryption... for now :)

I'm not sure why most people even pay for ssl certificates lately :-/

Ah, it's a new feature and I had to manually turn it on.. Great that they have it built-in now! 
Still doesn't explain why the tip didn't work))

Well, I've finished it yesterday, so if the author of the site likes my contribution - it'll be there pretty soon) Or you can download it from my github to your computer and run it locally - that would work fine in the meantime

True.. true.. While I know what I want to use on the web/mobile, I've completely neglected them in this post (

Actually, it's 0.01, which means it'll take even more time!

Ok, I took a second look..
Found the paper wallet page, got to play around with it.. To be perfectly honest, I don't see why it is better than Canton's design, or even bitaddress.org - two massively popular sites that have been used for a long time now. 
bitaddress.org has a perfectly good implementation of BIP0038, and bitcoinpaperwallet.com's code is based on that, so implementing it was trivial. So why should I use your implementation? So far I didn't see any benefits, and I, personally, found your page not very user friendly and cumbersome to use

Oh, I know.. And I'd love to help as well and be part of it. Only problem is - lack of free time lately :-(

That's a good point - how would one manage the taxes with the bitcoins varying so much in value?

Because linking to  is so hard in the OP so that newcomers know the F you are talking about..
Nah, let's just be an asshole about it

Ok, so I mist be missing something here.. 
Isn't a brain wallet just a mnemonic of sorts to remember the private key? So remembering the brain wallet sequence you can easily restore the private key, right?
How does BIP0038 help you here? As a second backup, where you'd back up the private key on a printed medium, but not worry about it being read? (since you need a password to decrypt it)
If that's the case, then you only need either the brain wallet, or the encrypted private key to restore the bitcoin address with it's private key, not both.. And as such - it really doesn't matter if the BIP0038 changes or not since it doesn't have to be static for it to work.
What am I missing?

Unfortunately I don't have much experience with most of the clients, and I'm mostly a beginner with bitcoins, compared to a number of the dwellers here..
Even so, I can see a couple things on that list that are wrong as it is.. It's missing some good clients (Mycelium for Android is a good example), and I think some information is outdated (MultiBit doesn't really need 50MB in space, while Electrum has hogged up over 20MB after just generating an empty address :) )
