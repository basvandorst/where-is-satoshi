when do you start reminding people?
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:26:43
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:33:58
how can signing shit before before he receives his orders help the seller
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:41:57
it is a waste of time to mention it is a repost
so far 58+ people hadn't seen it before since they upvoted it
so when you say it is a repost, you are basically saying that those 58+ people shouldnt have seen it

you are not contributing to the discussion with your post
which indicates YOU don't understand the voting system, since you didn't just downvote if it is a repost
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:45:11
so they are taking a huge loss from letting your lease their equiptment instead of using it themself
@_date: 2014-08-25 10:39:16
people believe what they want to believe and think you can accurately predict the future from old trends
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:02
that was lucky :D i wired some money yesterday, now im glad it wasnt instant XD
@_date: 2013-08-11 18:40:57
=/= != !=
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:07:13

@_date: 2013-04-13 15:14:33
more like 3-4 times over
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:12:04
tha same argument can be made for the 2011 bubble, that lasted for more than 2 months
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:17:14
OP might be a ***. wow crazy
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:39:57

What do you honestly believe? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:00
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:55:28
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:51:11
and not all people need to the get approved to buy/sell bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:16:01
is what the site says
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:45:48
this can go both ways, if they go below 0.9 W pr Ghash XD
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:03:15

WTF AM I DOING and rebought almost instantly, lost 10% :(
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:03:03

@_date: 2013-03-01 23:46:08
invest $75 and buy your own drinks :)
@_date: 2013-03-01 23:43:36
the only thing bothering me about this, is that i only found out about bitcoin 2 weeks ago :(
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:25:19
har kun 0.003 desværre 
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:03:25
the bitcoin transfer is (right now) limited to 7 tps but this is a software choice, that can be changed
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:03:13


not if he believes that a HDD can mine


would mean he earnt ~$9000 /hour
@_date: 2013-03-08 11:20:39
think you missed a , or . depending on country :P
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:23:57
waiting patiently on my deposit going through :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:32:43

@_date: 2013-03-06 20:14:03
Nick Colas.... nice parents XD
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:13:08

@_date: 2013-03-04 15:44:40
no pictures doesnt really help them
@_date: 2013-03-03 22:28:39
I got 140 MHashes on a gtx580  sucks that nvidia cards are so bad
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:08:30
no... 
if you sold a collicteble and a year later the new owner sold it for 300% more, then the first owner would have lost money
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:19:12
tror ikke der er nogen
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:46:41
never unsolvable... just taking longer to "guess" the right code
the difficulty can basically be viewed as numbers an the higher the difficulty the more numbers to guess
@_date: 2013-02-26 23:03:53
$30USD - thats a poor retirement XD
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:16:57


because he needs that
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:33:12
yeah but you implied that everybody would know of bitcoin someday
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:08:26
145 now and jumping all over the place
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:26:07
but those 95Thas/s also generate 144*25 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:38:25
hope you didnt :P
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:11:41
almost 20% in 18 hours DAMN
@_date: 2013-06-22 08:47:58
with that logic....
He payed 110 BTC and will earn 55 BTC so he will lose 55 BTC on this trade
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:13:39
i got denied twice because my utility bills are in danish and they demanded i got it professionally translated.
insted i sent them 5 different bills, but since all my bills are emailed as PDF to a government issued account, they dont trust them :(
@_date: 2013-08-11 21:00:28
screw those guys/girls
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:08
yeah i wired some money today and just waitng for them to show up in my account :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:55:24
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:54:28
think it was the combination of pure PDF bill and a language they didnt know :S
@_date: 2013-10-11 01:41:18
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:18:03
in denmark it has crossed 1000 DKK
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:08:34
is that only for the ~0.5 BTC pr block
or all 25
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:27:53
i thought "it will happen at 200, no wait 300, 400, omg 500, wtf why didn't i buy, but now its crashing 600, 700 OMFG"
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:39:39
yeah, i have definitely learned from this
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:55:07
not trying to be a jerk, but what is the regulair subreddit for then?
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:37:04
yeah because right now a LOT of ASICs are being delivered meaning that the exponential curve will probably last for a couple of months
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:39:06
there should be a little area that tells you how many people are waiting for their validation to be completed and how many they get through in a day
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:04:31
congrats on bleeding the faucet dry
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:50:47
it has jumped 50% the last half month
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:16:10
 right now, started at 2200 9 days ago
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:01:43
bad math 2^11 = 2048
2048*200 = 409600
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:33:27
but also much more difficult
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:56:49
yeah i thought the same
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:33:47
doesnt this just assume that because bitcoins have risen the last 3 months it will continue indefinitely
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:16:59
yeah but on the other side, I think I would have died from stress every time the value fell
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:04:27
yeah but the problem is that nobody knows where we are on this chart
@_date: 2013-08-12 21:00:29
ahh missed that part... but still crazy that a 6 months ago the  difficulty was 1/10 of what it is now
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:48:48
i made a failed transaction at 40$ and thought it was a sign to not try a second time :(
@_date: 2013-08-19 01:03:14


do you mean you tried to withdraw $327 and had to pay $20.40 for it? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:37:32
it reached 1.5 hour
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:01:10
it tells you have many verifications that are qued
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:15:22
it reached 4500 seconds
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:48:45
i would love to see a tech buble burst
*okay guys back to stoneage*
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:54:16
did the hashing power decrease or did the difficulty increase
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:05:10
i think the ammo part is wrong and they only get to keep the gun. and then run to the barracks for ammo in case of war
