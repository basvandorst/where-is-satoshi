But I am a little confused why people would want to be using multiple Ledgers with multiple wallet seed phrases anyway? That makes it more confusing and more likely to lose a piece of information in the process or transferring or restoring coins or whatever, right? Mind you, I have a Ledger Nano S I bought ~6 months back, and I am still hesitant to set it up, but don’t feel comfortable leaving my btc and ltc on Coinbase either :/

Haha so funny, I love it. Dont worry you'll get your real Lambo one day, just keep hodling!

Thanks for this, and it was definitely informative. I do have one issue. I use the wallet coinbase to regularly purchase bitcoin, and when I signed up I had a notification from an unknown individual. This notification was either asking me to send 1.00 bitcoin to him, or for me to accept the payment of 1.00. However I could not figure out which it was, and it confused me so I declined the request. How can someone with some technical background but no experience with bitcoin and the blockchain figure out these small kinks because I am still a little confused on addresses, as well as sending/receiving bitcoin. Thanks

So funny, I bought in 2016 so not as early as I could have but still at a good price imo

Dumb questions: 
1. How do I sell my bitcoins for fiat if it's on a hardware wallet?
2. What is a good hardware wallet to use, and how do you use them?

No centralization, it's a bad idea. Decentralization is what makes bitcoin what it is, and we should strive to keep it that way.

Nicely written article, more of these please, less clickbait! BTC ftw!
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:21:51
How does that make sense? You buy AFTER it increases 20 percent? I don't get it.

Started buying December 2015, sold a little here and there since then. Have been hodling most of what I have.

F***in a, lol no joke, you’re right on!

Good read, guess we’ll have to wait and see. John McAfee, if you’re out there, we’re rooting for your prediction! HODL

How do hardware wallets do that? Isn’t plugging the hardware wallet into the pc with a usb cord potentially vulnerable to malware or data stealing through the usb cable?

Maybe, maybe not, who is joining the adoption? Are they going to be valuable to bitcoin? How do we ever know that?
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:16:38
I know right this dumbass doesn’t know what he is generalizing. Plenty of pretty honest people, like me, with an investment in bitcoin and not using it AT ALL for drugs or illicit sex or anything else illegal. Kind of pisses me off.

Thanks, got it now.
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:43:51
I’m cashing out all of mine, but I’m just glad that I’m not the only one who didn’t sell at 19.7k! Then I hope to buy the dip again!

Wouldn’t starting a Bitcoin ETF cause the cryptocurrency to be more centralized? We don’t want that, right? I would say no to an ETF, but why would the SEC say no?

Awesome, so good, classic movie, and great news for btc!
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:42:29
Roughly $700, since I bought bitcoin in small installments and then bought 2 at $682.

I doubt I have any on my wallet, it’s still confusing to me if I already synced to the blockchain or not...
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:40:41
I don’t think so, because when I installed the file reader and tried to open the original .dat file, im pretty sure it converted it to a video file. Now when I save any new .dat backup file, it converts to a video file.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:26:58
I have my bitcoin on the Coinbase exchange, and I do want to get it off of there at some point. How do I know if it’s fully synced? There’s no indication of anything on Bitcoin Core just an empty balance and no transactions....
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:37:07
It says “up to date processed a big number of blocks of transaction history”

And then send me 10 btc, jeez the glass is always half empty.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:53:04
Ok I will have to turn my computer back on, like I said, I downloaded something for hours yesterday, but you’re right it probably hasn’t synced...thanks for response!
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:17:50
I think it converted it, but I’m not sure because now when I save the backup it says the video file thing as the file type even though I save it as a .dat extension, I’m not sure why installing a file reader would do that to the backup files?
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:26:28
What does it mean they will be launching to customers? Will coinbase be changing in any way?
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:49:54
If I hadn't spent most of what I saved on btc a year and a half ago I wouldn't be as worried as I am now, hope it goes back up this year!
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:54:03
Yes I still have a lot to learn about Bitcoin, so I will do my research and not gamble with what I have already invested!
