Sounds more like an infomercial for his gold money business. 
Peter wants people to use his gold money over crypto. Doing so requires full trust in his business as the third party.

The only tax exempted is VAT.


You do know that they will still tax gains/profits?  Capital Gains tax is 28% in Portugal. Income tax is progressive starting at 14.5% all the way up to 48%.

Isn't modern day banking pure fraud? 
The part where they issue more loan money than they have in reserves, effectively increasing the money supply,  stealing from everyone.
What about the part where big banks look the other way during obvious crimes, instead choosing to pay fines, because it's cheaper that way. 
It's funny when they call bitcoin (honest money) = fraud, yet what banks do is somehow totally legit.

There are over 2000 shitcoins that sacrifice security and decentralization for speed and scalability. Then there's other aspects like first mover advantage and the network effect. I don't need to research them all to know that somewhere in the order of 92% are ultimately going to fail miserably, and that real solution to TPS/scaling lies with layer 2.
But of course, every shitcoin investor has found the exception that's going to survive the bloodbath. Because they're somehow more informed by reading through marketing hype and ignoring fundamentals.

Not sure on 25 word seeds. But for 24 word seeds, the 24th word is a checksum of the first 23. So you may need to calculate the checksum and figure out the correct word to use.

Negative interest rates equals theft on a grand scale. Anyone holding fiat will need to pay a percentage of their capital each year to the bank, whereas borrowers will be paid to take on more debt. Free money for borrowers. 
Negative interest rates means the entire system is broken.  It will eventually lead to hyperinflation.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:23:17


The world is going to negative interest rates, 0% yield is more attractive than -N%.
