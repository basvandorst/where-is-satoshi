I read what you said and I care what he said. I don't think what you said makes too much sense.

A funny thing to say in a forum where you may regularly interact with those brighter minds that *are* determining bitcoin's fate, not to mention that it is an open source project and anyone may choose to help.

Ughh, I'm really jealous you got to watch that occur.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:54:23
Yeah, definitely not serious.  I was genuinely surprised though at the percentage of those that think it should be banned.

We do have banks that offer sub accounts and per account goals, it's just not as common as you'd hope.

I don't think anyone cares that you learned the word in a different context, only that you claim it meant something different than it does here.  It seems that the word has the *same* meaning in different contexts, so what is your point / what did you take the word to mean?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:57:00
That's a really good point!

Well said.  Open Transactions really really excites me and I can't wait to see how it develops.  I should take a page from your book though and be more active in developing the things I want to see.

You're probably right; it just seemed maybe a bit too coincidental that the two cryptographic improvements were in ECDSA and Scrypt.  I'll admit though, I look at everything through a bitcoin lens and I don't know a ton and cryptography.

Btc to btc ROI is the only honest way to calculate it, especially if your goal is to hold bitcoins.  The ONLY way a mining rig is actually profitable is, if over it's lifetime, it produces more bitcoins than it would have cost you to purchase it, at the time you purchased it.
@_date: 2013-09-08 07:01:54
I know about Planetary Resources.  You're still not proving your point.  Which one is easier?... I'm not saying asteroid mining is impossible or anything, but neither is attacking bitcoin, do you agree?  A 51% attack would much easier to accomplish.  It would be cheaper and faster (at least at this moment in time) than changing the availability of gold via asteroid mining.  
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:50:10
Yes I understand that it exists, but the fact of the matter is it still take billions of dollars to accomplish, contrasted with attacking bitcoin which, I believe, would be considerably cheaper.  I still believe in bitcoin though, just playing devils advocate I suppose.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:44:42
Well, that value might not be too far off, but there's a more accurate way to do it.  I believe that all of the major exchanges give access to their 'orderbooks' via their API's.  The orderbook is the sorted list of all bid and ask orders.  You can imagine the bid orders in one list and the ask orders in another (bids are buys, asks are sells).  So when someone decides they are willing to buy bitcoin if it hits a particular price (ex, I'll buy 1.25 BTC if the price hits 500), their order is added to the orderbook.  A lot of people are interested in trading and are willing to buy different amounts of bitcoin at different prices.  To calculate what you're interested in, you'd have to look at the orderbook and remove every bid until you've removed 149,737.32 BTC from the top of the bid side.  The highest price on the bid side of the orderbook, after having subtracted the order volume, is the price you're interested in.  If you compiled all of the exchange orderbooks, you could find the exact price that bitcoin would drop to (at that instant in time).
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:28:59
That's a good point, but which is harder, attacking the network or mining an asteroid?  It's going to be a while before mining an asteroid is easier.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:50:21
I don't have the time at the moment, but you could totally do it.  You'd have to pull the orderbooks for each of the major exchanges, subtract this transaction amount from the cumulative bid volume and see how low of a price that gets you down to.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:58
1) It would be easy to move the bitcoin.  You could do it on a thumb drive or on a paper wallet.  I might be a bit concerned about your exchange rate risk with that much money invested.  It could go up or down substantially.
2) Your best bet would probably be to wire money to one of the big exchanges, bitstamp, btc-e, or MtGox.
3) You should be able to sell your bitcoin and withdraw your money in the US, but I'd advise against MtGox if that's your plan.  Gox is taking a very long time to process USD withdrawals.
Good luck!

If they sold them, then the price would go down.
