Your math is way off, and you're using terminology that you've demonstrated you don't understand. Brokers are regulated by FINRA, fees of 2-4% don't amount to 120k btc. And "make alpha"? That's all pure spec.

While downvoting is the immediate response, and I downvoted this. I think it's worth watching. But keep in mind that IBTimes owns Newsweek.

This is interesting, what else other than Tenebrix has it implemented correctly?

Thank fuck this is the most up voted comment on this clown's article.

Most people are mining Doge and trading it for BTC, so it's a boon to cryptos in any regard. There are issues with their inflation rate and I don't think the velocity of transactions in Doge are going to fix them. 
Looking at the exchange rate, yes it did spike after the Jamaican bobsled event, but the price vs BTC has been dropping steadily since.

Can you expand on this? A snippet or quote? I'm on mobile and don't have the doc.

Do you know if they plan to make it open or close end? Open end would function as you suggest but if it were closed it would trade at a premium or discount to NAV and not have a significant impact because there will be no adding or removing of coins, just shares of the etf changing hands. I anticipate this etf would trade at a significant premium if closed ended because there would be just too many buyers. Alternatively if they make it open ended then shares can be shorted and volatility will spike even more.

FUD or source or reasoning? Serious request.

It's because there is a demand for pick axes and shovels. And these days companies like Barrick Gold dominate the space and the smaller players take huge gambles. 
Why wouldn't a manufacturer of hardware (which is a real, cost intensive business), not want to ensure they at least turn a profit on the hardware they manufacture and sell? They don't HAVE to mine and could possibly just sell the hardware. It's a business just like any other business. 
Realistically though, because caveat emptor reigns supreme in the crypto currency world, AND it's generally accepted that individuals are profit motivated, it doesn't make sense that a company would sell their hardware if it were more profitable to manufacture and mine using it. So it's not worth buying if you're planning to mine. 
BUT, logic doesn't always prevail.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:41:57
Agreed. Ive always classified it as a commodity when talking with institutions asking me about it.
Itt: people who don't understand the difference between currency and money.

Not sure if you're also being sarcastic. WSJ was bought by News Corp a few years back. IMO it's been a political rag since.

Interesting thanks for sharing I hadn't thought to search for the S-1. This is an open end ETF, then. Similar to the gold ETF, GLD. I have a lot of concerns with GLD that make me hesitant to buy and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either specifically because it is open ended and liquidity (rather, access to the metal) could dry up or the fund could over extend itself.
But then again, considering everyone on this sub probably knows how to buy and store coin, they wouldn't bother with the ETF anyway. Just as I don't bother with bullion ETFs when I can just hold the metal. But in this case the liquidity of coin is far better than with bullion seeing as how you can sell coin immediately and don't have to go out and find a 'coin dealer' (bullion dealer).
Ultimately this is good for exposure and access for those who can't get it currently (non-technologically inclined or people with IRAs) and in my opinion will definitely create massive accessibility and subsequently demand from retail investors. Just hope they don't get their keys hacked, it's a lot easier to steal private keys than go through the work of diluting gold bullion with tungsten ;).

Does anyone know whether they will be making this a closed end or open end etf? If it's closed then it's the same, except bought on an exchange. If open, look out.

Uh subpoena? Links?

This is great thank you. Good to know it would be difficult to do with the network needing to consent. The only concern would be a central entity taking over a majority of the hashing power and forking the current build and subsequently forking the block chain to the inflationary one. 
But if this were to occur couldn't everyone here just maintain the current block chain? How would peyote differentiate coin from the current to the forked block chain?
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:17:43
Precisely why I asked. I've been a holder for years and didn't realize the devs could make a change like this on the fly. Good to know the network needs to consent on the new build/ accept the fork.

The only "regulation" that will solve this is the market, and this is what we are seeing happen now with Gox.

Came here to ask/say this very thing. It's damning that it's a US company that is creating this awesome hardware that can be put anywhere, but they can't operate any of them in the US.
Edit: Rather, the cost of implementation in the US is so high that it's relegated to certain companies who can pay the fees or already have the licenses.

What exchanges are you using now? Are they as liquid as Bitstamp?

The people who got REALLY rich off the California gold rush (if they weren't a few of the first discoverers) were the ones selling pick axes and shovels, not the ones who arrived late on the scene and starting a mining project.

Too soon imo, but good luck.

~~It's the first post since Jan 7, 2011. So~~ Unless the account was hacked (how likely is that?) or Dorian Nakamoto has access to the account to post this as a red herring, it seems legit. Can anyone offer insights?

A short is a sell, with a promise to buy in the future. Rather, if you short, the buy is only necessitated by not losing money on a trade that goes against you. If something you short goes to zero, you don't have to buy it back.

Although it was never confirmed that Jesse Livermore was the person that Edwin Lefevre based Larry Livingston on, yes, his name was Jesse. The book uses a different name. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:56:10
Hahahaha you're right, also you blew my mind. I guess the wording made it sound awkward, I was looking at it from the perspective of the actions of one side of the trade.

Actually, the NAR (National Association of Realtors) is not subject to AML (anti money laundering) and KYC (know your client) regulations as far as the government is concerned, so you can buy a house with a literal boatload of cash and there will be no questions asked. ;)
The above is also the reason why the US real estate market is still doing QUITE well in high net worth areas.. how do you think cartels and other illicit gainers get their cash into the states?
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:47:45
I'm doubtful anything will change, the NAR lobby is the biggest lobby most have never heard of. A vast majority of income earning, 401k holding Americans have their wealth tied up in their homes. Add that to the fact that real estate investments have been bundled and sold as AAA paper as far back as 2006 to a large pool of international investors as well as governments, and you start to understand where the incentives for this lack of oversight lie.
EDIT: Let me explain what the implication of these being investments sold to international governments has to do with the lack of oversight-- the money flooding into real estate from abroad helps keep the market afloat, re-fis and low interest rates help keep loans current. Everyone is happy. When governments start to worry that their 'good as gold' 'just like AAA government paper' investments might not pay, they will dump them and cause a far bigger fiasco than the housing bubble popping. The actions being taken are essentially re-inflating the bubble.

It's a trap.
