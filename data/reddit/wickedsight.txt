I realize that many people posting here haven't been around that long, but this stuff really feels like what happened at Mt. Gox. The fall of Gox (and with it the value of crypto) all started with an increasing amount of open tickets and missing withdrawals/deposits.
If you're heavily invested, keep an eye on this, because a collapse of Coinbase will kill the value of most cryptos. Took about 3 years to get back to ATH after Gox collapsed.

I agree with this, but blockchain isn't bitcoin. Blockchain sticking around has nothing to do with bitcoin at all.

Then sold at 2.5k before buying again at 15k.

Enlighten me. Because AFAIK [nobody really knows]( so I'd love to hear your truth.

Pretty much every definition of currency describes it as being circulated and being used for trade. A currency just sitting somewhere isn't being used for trade. This one of the reasons why gold, from your other thread, isn't a currency, but a commodity. If Bitcoin isn't actively used in trade, isn't a commodity with intrinsic value and isn't some kind of replacement for stock (see ICO's), then it shouldn't have any value.

Actually, it's more of a representation of how much value isn't out there anymore. It's also an example on how value means nothing, even when the company has 320 billion a year in revenue, it can still lose 1/3 of its value in a couple of months.

I feel like the bulls are already running.

How do you know what will happen on the extremely long time frame? This reads like the reasoning of somebody telling themselves that their loss will be returned if they waited long enough, not like sound investment advice...

Then first there needs to be a benefit in using cryptocurrency for pretty much everybody. Currently there is none. As opposed to piracy, which gives free stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:51:08
If you want easy access to any movie/series, piracy is pretty much the only real option. If you want to transfer money to somebody else, there are plenty feasible options already for the mainstream. Also, pretty much everybody I know now uses Spotify for music, if a comparable service existed for video, it could near kill torrents.
Sure, it'll probably stick around, but I don't expect it to ever spread anywhere as much as torrents. Everybody I know who does anything with crypto is in it for the Lamborghini, not for the transfer or storage of money.

Blockchain, yes. Unregulated cryptocurrency, I still have many doubts.

This comment is already outdated since the low is 8827 atm.

A meme is not an investment strategy.

Probably can't prop them up next to your desk though. At least over here, the license demands it's in a safe when it's not being used.

Last year the media reported the opposite and helped push BTC to an all-time high. Did you feel bad then too?

They're keeping you away from $4m-ish, I'd keep posting too. Good luck getting it back.
