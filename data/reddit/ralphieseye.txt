I suspect comments like these are *from* children.

Is everyone here teenagers? That shit is easy to remember when you're fresh out of your diapers, when you're 30+, you can't remember that stuff as easily. I aced calculus but now I can't remember how to divide fractions properly -- it's a combination of using calculators and old age that does the trick. Just because you know how to work out a price, doesn't mean everyone can. Say bitcoin is worth 46,329 USD, and I have .235 btc, how much is that? Now what if I want to play around with the variables? That's what questions like this are about. A calculator allows you to change those variables quickly and without much thought.

You're not entering a valid address. I know you think you are, but check the address carefully. There should be no "Bitcoin:" in front of it. I know that happens sometimes when copying the address from a bitcoin wallet.

The Chinese miners are spamming the network in order to raise the fees, and make the bitcoin network look congested. It's so obvious that I don't entirely know why they think they're going to be successful. They're doing this to get people to take a second look at their alternative(s) and/or to try and get bigger blocks. All they're doing, however, is showing us the need for a more robust network which will make attacks like these impossible in the future. The Chinese cabals/cartels are very petty and myopic.

How about never forgetting that any entity, whether a corporation, your father, or a political group will do what's in their best interests. Coinbase likely chose to back the coder because it would have benefited them in some way, whether more control, or more profits, these people, **all** people will do what's best for them. Do not expect reality or life to be like a Hollywood movie where people forgo what's best for them in order to improve society or for some good cause. That's fairy-tale level shit right there. It's also why libertarianism and/or anarcho-capitalism can never work. It just takes one bad actor to ruin it for everyone else and create a monopoly, or take advantage of a lack of regulations, etc. You get the idea. 
That kind of ideology is at odds with human nature itself. And that's why it has remained a pipe-dream of sheltered 20-somethings living in their parents basements. A lack of life experience and being sheltered from how cruel and evil the world can be leads to a political naivety. Fortunately many people grow out of it as they approach their 30s and "wise up" to the nature of the real world.

Is it from the mobile app? Or their website?

No, **it's not coinbase clogging the network**. There's solid proof that it's the result of Chinese actors. Someone spun up several instances on amazon and used that to attack the network, increasing fees, etc.

That wasn't it at all; It was because Bitmain didn't want his ASICboost to disappear. So he hurried to push out his bigger blocks that allowed asicboost to continue. Devs want bigger blocks but want asicboost nixed. Bitmain and that team wanted to still game the system and they wanted to consolidate power into their company and pools. 
The core team wanted it decentralized. If you just see this as bigger block debate, then you're wholly uninformed. The "other side" was the miners, aka Jihan and Bitmain vs literally everyone else. It should be noted that more than 50% of the hashrate rests behind China's great firewall, aka China owns bitcoin mining right now. This was a political argument just as much, if not more than a technical argument.

I'm afraid you're wrong. For starters, there's two versions of asicboost, covert and overt. Segwit destroys "covert" asicboost.

Heh, no that's OK. You could try a different browser, perhaps there's some add-on or extension messing with your input (inserting a tab or a space before/after). Or even try the coinbase application for android/iphone.

Says who? Does the whitepaper say "Only people who run nodes are peers"?
And it's only "important" if you're trying to use technical loopholes to win an argument online. The spirit of the statement holds true, technicalities aside. I also contend that the "electronic cash" aspect is the most important part of that sentence. He didn't say "commodity" or "t-bill" or "store of value".
