The thing is that Bitcoin is not a thing, it’s a decentralized network. It’s everywhere and nowhere. If it ever became a “thing” it would fail. There is a know issue called a 51% attack. Where more than half the network comes under the control of a single entity. This would cause Bitcoin to fail.

Cryptography is always theoretically bulletproof. It’s the human factor in it’s implementation that compromises it. Part of creating paper wallets is printing them out, people should be aware that the printing is the step in the process that is vulnerable to attack.

Never the less, the PSA “If you’re using a printer that is not completely offline and inaccessible to other people, assume everything you print is public information.” Is not FUD, it’s good advice.
