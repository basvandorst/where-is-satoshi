When do you think bitcoin will be practically secure enough that you'd stake your livelihood on it? Starving or losing your home because of a bitcoin worm sounds like a pretty shitty deal, and it's a possibility you can't ignore.

48 hours later, still no prediction on LongBets.org. 
He doesn't even need to find someone to bet against him to place his prediction.
So two days later, not only has this guy not bet anything on the site, he hasn't even registered his intention to bet anything on the site.

At longbets.org the money goes to the winner's charity of choice.

He hasn't bet anything yet. He has to find another LongBets.org member to pay $10k upfront against him, and he hasn't even posted his prediction on the site yet.

Roger Ver is completely flaking on his bet. He hasn't put his prediction on longbets.org, which is the first step in finding someone to bet against him.
The guy has yet to put his money where his mouth is, but he sure is getting a lot of free advertising for his website which he plasters over everything he posts or writes. I'd bet that in a month he's going to flake out completely and give some flakey excuse about longbets.org not accepting his prediction.

If the name and the photo is all that's required, why won't they let you blank out your drivers license   of birth/address? Dwolla is going to be sitting on a hackers goldmine of identify theft booty.
