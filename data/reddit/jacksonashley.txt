Congratulations. You just stumbled upon the origins of the barter system. You're cold, but not hungry and have an extra hamburger. I'm hungry, but not cold, and I have an extra blanket. We trade blanket and hamburger, and we both are better off.
Now imagine there are many hungry people, all with varying numbers of blankets. Which person do you trade with? The one who offers you 10 blankets when everyone else offers you 1. The market value of your hamburger? 10 blankets. The intrinsic value of the hamburger? feeds you when you're hungry.
I hope this helps.

Ignoring the fact that everything is upgradable (Credit Cards and ATMs are essentially upgrades to the banking system), upgrades for bitcoin are not seamless.
As soon as bitcoin is "upgraded" with a new version (or any other cryptocurrency) you essentially fork the product and create your own competing currency.
To avoid that problem, it requires that ALL the bitcoin users agree to the upgrade to be seamless.  Otherwise you're forking the currency.
Which would be easy to handle if Bitcoin had a central authority, but since is designed to be decentralized, getting all players to agree is practically impossible.

Gox won't be the end of bitcoin, but bitcoin may never reach those record high prices again. 
Cryptocurrency has serious architecture flaws and liquidity problems that prevent it from mass adoption. The lack of a central authority is a severe hindrance to its stability. An unstable commodity isn't a problem, but no one wants their currency to be unstable.
Bitcoin will continue to exist for years, but it will never become a global world currency. At best it will be an alternative to PayPal.

Your complete incomprehension of basic economic terms is staggering.
Seriously, go read a basic economics textbook, or take a class at your local community college.
