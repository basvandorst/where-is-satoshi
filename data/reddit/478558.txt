I've been on both before rbtc was and my perspective is that rbtc only exists because of the overhanded moderation here. Many of us unsubbed rbitcoin because of it. I'm not a  but I definitely think LN looks suspiciously like they're reinventing banking and permission-gated payment systems instead of peer to peer currency. I find myself too greedy to dump my BTC for BTH but I have since the split only put new USD into BTH due to my loss of faith in the direction of BTC.
 
I entered all this as a sysadmin/free software enthusiast so I have my biases but they're clouded by my greed. I first heard of bitcoin from slashdot in like 2010 or 2011. I don't know what to think about its direction any more either. I told myself that my exit plan was as soon as I lose faith in the direction, I'd be out. But I fear my greed has clouded my ability to think rationally because I definitely think cores direction is not what the whitepaper proposed. 
I'm tempted to split my BTC into 3: holding 1/3, transfering 1/3 into BTH and using 1/3 to buy my own mining hardware to mine whichever is most profitable at the moment but I'm frozen with greed/doubt/uncertainty. I also consider selling out completely or HODL and ignore the whole thing for a few more years because some of the most boring years lead to this point in time which is anything but boring.
Ultimately I think the whole crypto market is going up so I'll likely stay invested somewhat if only because it's hard to get fiat into play at all. my 2 sat
