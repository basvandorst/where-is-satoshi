If you aren't self-aware about the joke that is crypto culture you're going to miss all of the necessary context baked into Ethan's humor.

Lol… he's mocking it. What makes you think he's into crypto? The internet and reddit at large is into crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:10:01
He's making fun of crypto culture at large. This is his magic style of satire.

This. Home ownership can be a nightmare and should be expected at times. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:54
Oh no... this is really bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:44:55
Some good quality meme right here.

well played

This isn't true at all? ETH has one of the best communities for practical application. BTC is simply a reflection of value and more like digital gold.

How much fees would one incur on the following transactions?
* 1BTC
* 2BTC
* 10BTC
Does the fee stay the same for your transfers or does it scale up exponentially?

Am I the only one that thinks HODL is nerdy as fuck?

How does one literally mine a block?

You like Trump brah?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:21:36
This is so unfortunately confusing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:22:42
True! But still a lot of ups and downs from a liability POV.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:08:49
Lol at people in this sub watching Fox News ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:28
Also curious about this…
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:35
Lol grow up dude. Nobody on a large scale think of dates like tragedies. This is fucked up on Coinbase’s part but large majority will forget.

What's on the 9th?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:38:16
They literally just said the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:27
Dropped $600 in a second
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:41:40
I know. I'm looking around and wish there were some other analysts next to me. This is intense!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:19
What in the actual fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:06
What is this pulsing through my body? This is mesmerizing!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:59
good point! .06% change isn't much.
