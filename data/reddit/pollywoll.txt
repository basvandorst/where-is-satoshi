Tell me how that helps your failing coin. Lightening won't matter cos all the smart investors are shifting their money out of bitcoin core (the shitcoin) and into actually useful cryptos.

How is it not?
Bitcoin, in the end will be the ultimate alt.
After all, it is the greatest shitcoin, with the worst tech and most limited uses.

Shitcoiners (BTC'ers) just don't like insider trading when it moves against them.

Do you really think they are analogous "investments"? If so the, you've been afflicted by bitmania friend.

Wow you sound like a sanctimonious ass-hole. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:15:10
Also overvalued. WHat;s your point?

BTC is centralised in china. and held by a couple of rich cucks.

Bit late there shitcoiners. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:28:35
This is such a weird comparison . . .
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:17:13
Those companies have significant competitive (and long lasting) advantages against their comp. BTC does not. LOL

It actually is closer to the original white paper though. So you are incorrect fren.

Line 2
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.
Not really being used as cash, it'd being held like an asset. Notice how houses aren't used as cash mate? 
" since there is no central authority to issue them."
The big miners r ur central authority now. You've replaced one master with another.

Just because we don't agree with your position, why do you infer ignorance on our part. This is part of a generic internet argument tactic, and is weak.

I think fiat is legit, if not problematic. Bitcoin is not a scam, but it's grossly overvalued. To me the only thing really driving Bitcoin's massive gain is unbridled hype and speculation. I think this will stop at some point and then Bitcoin will be valued more accurately.  This is quite a recurring theme for new investments.
