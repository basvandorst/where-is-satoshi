Fun fact, I work in a small'ish danish bank, and since we currently have to pay the national bank of Denmark to deposit overflow money, we currently for private persons give zero interest in most cases, and business accounts with big holdings actually have to pay 0.2—0.65% to have money in their accounts.

I wrote my bachelor about Bitcoins. Granted that this was in the earlier days - late 13 / early 14, really interesting period for bitcoin. 
My focus areas was bitcoin as an investment tool - Even though this is not the primary idea of bitcoin, being another share to invest in, it's certainly something thats keeping bitcoins very interesting right now, and for the short term.
When looking on the long term, what does bitcoin do to our economy, should we actually start to move onto using and accepting bitcoin globally.
Unfortunately I guess I won't be of much use for you, since all my bachelor is written in Danish, and it's also very outdated now, one could say.
back then i also spend a good deal of time explaining some of the issues and buzzwords at the time, namely silkroad, mt.gox and so on.. I got a statement from our goverment / tax system and their views on bitcoin.

Anyway thank you a lot for your input !
