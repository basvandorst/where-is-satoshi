That's fine, after I sent the btc, I felt proud of myself that I was able to help someone half way around the world, but it turns out it was a lie, sigh, good lesson for me too though, at least now I know I must be patience and research before donate my btc.

I work in a big data team in an international company, and it is unusual that the database would be down for that long. Usually there's a quick fail over and users wouldn't even notice the downtime. It's either that or Binance fucked up big time
