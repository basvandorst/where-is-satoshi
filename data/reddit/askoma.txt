yep, I able to see the transaction, here is an example 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:11:27
sorry, english isn't my native language, by saying "receiving" I mean balance is always zero. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:23:35
I'm sorry, that was a problem with `bitgo` testnet. Thanks for your help anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:05:15
no, there is such address in `listaddressgroupings`
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:01:39
The second place is Kraken. 
Bittrex is a slowpok.

I use `bitgo` for send test coins, and addresses in `bitgo` started with `2...`, for example `2MuW4zQb11coApe9HkJjK........`
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:12:26
I can't get what the private key you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:00:18
sending to the address like that(`2M....`), works as expected, but receiving isn't working.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:10:14
with a simple `getnewaddress ACCOUNT` command. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:50:00
sure, it's latest `bitcoin-cli -testnet getblockcount` =&gt; `1181032`
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:28:45
I know, it's confirmations count, I set 0 to check if anything income to my wallet(address). I'm using faucets to send coins and check if it's works, and with faucets it's works.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:57:41
yes, there is no such transaction in `listunspent`. I only able to see info about this kind of transaction with command like `bitcoin-cli -testnet getrawtransaction TXID true`
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:40:27
It's a fake. Source is about 2016 year.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:37:02
CEX.io was the first who resolve my issue. **CEX.io has a best support right now.**
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:21:12
but cli client shows me zero balance for wallet `bitcoin-cli -testnet getreceivedbyaddress n2z73SRtBjX7wV4WPjXFwLYvwiydFQmJLn 0` =&gt; `0.00000`
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:25:47
But to check the status of tickets you need to be logged, or I'm missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:14:28
Thanks for the advice! The most stupid support is kraken. To get a ticket you need to login. All tickets from the email they delete. What to do if you can not login is unknown.
