For you to hodl, someone had to un-hodl though.

Eh, you can always catch the next 10k dip

This is some classic Bitcoin: it's *always* the user's fault.
Reinventing the financial system one SFYL at a time.

No reflection on Bitcoin whatsoever.
Why does this keep happening to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:55:30
"I'll assume the end-user is competent!" has never really worked well for mass adoption.

Bitcoin as a transaction medium is crippled by design. It's overwrought for that purpose.
The truth of the matter is that bitcoin is not really good at anything, just has a lot of hype and a lot of folks paying in for magic money tokens.

I'll enjoy some mixed nuts.

This reads like some MLM Facebook schtick.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:18
You're paying in so someone can cash out, by the way.
That's how this works.

How is it faster than using a credit card or even a Starbucks card loaded with money?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:04:30
Strong turkey sales; lots of people liquidated their *coins for Thanksgiving.

Blockchain is a shitty technology.
It's an overwrought mess.

I have a Starbucks card, you can load them onto your phone.
So I just take out my phone and scan the barcode. No fingerprint step needed, either.

Then what the hell is it? Seriously.
The "technology" is bloated, energy-intensive, and wasteful. 
You can't use it for transactions, merchants are dropping support and user experience is terrible.
It seems like its only purpose is a vehicle for scams.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:53:23
Thanksgiving-turkey liquidating pressure has transitioned into Christmas-ham liquidating pressure! And of course, Chinese New Year is around the corner...

Be careful with getting "taught" by the Internet, it's a good way to get scammed.

This is kinda like arguing the differences between ephebophile and pedophile.

Blockchain technology is a novelty at best, it's pretty worthless.

Of course, it's for advising people that *this time* is the last time you'll be able to buy below 10k.

This is just people cashing out to pre-order Borderlands 3.

No, no... people have received their Easter presents and are ready to invest it back into bitcoin!
Prepare for a huge rally!

I'm intrigued by your fart freezing technology, do you happen to have a website or white paper I could review?

Can you send me a link to this new Tada exchange?
