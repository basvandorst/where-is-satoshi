Wasn’t he that drug dealer who went to proson?

Men, he, man, male.  You are as bad as ‘him’.

It’s nearly $6200 right now, lmao.
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:00:23
I have never stumbled across a penny.  How am I supposed to find 3600 per hour?  Stupid thread.

Don’t get a hard on then.

Blockchain’s killer app may well turn out to be an alt coin such as REQ (Request Network) if it suceeds in triggering mass adoption of Bitcoin.  Easy fiat to crypto for the masses and we have the elusive ‘killer app’.

You can but that means doing drug deals in person

That’s an awful lot of numbers and figures that appear in your ‘vision’.   How come you change from present tense to past tense?  Rather than writing this piece and massaging your ego by pretending that you are some sort of ‘Chosen One’, you could have simply offered it up as a ficticious scenario.  That way people would be more willing to discuss this and we could have had quite an interesting discussion.

Not just US air either but their tentacles are trying to ban air all over the planet.

You meant 28,000 sats or 28kS, not 28,000 kS.  Also it should be 277,000,000 sats or “Two-hundred and Seventy-seven Million Sats” not 277,000,000 kS.
“At the current Bitcoin price, a brand-new, top of the line Mac-Book Pro ($2399.00) would be listed under this new convention as: 28,000 kS. A 2018 Honda Accord ($23,570)? Easy... that's 277,000,000 kS, or when spoken: "Two-Hundred and Seventy-Seven Million Kilo-Sat". Or if you prefer: 2.8 BTC.”

“Bitcoin is not the AOL of crypto. It is the only blockchain that is working to solve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. I repeat.... there is not one other blockchain any where near solving the scalability issues without making security and decentralization sacrifices!”
Well, this part of your post is wrong.  Waltonchain HAVE solved scalability issues with their unique child chain structure at ZERO cost to security or decentralization.

Would ‘non-explosive growth’ be a better term?  In crypto large multiples are the norm.

That’s right, the entire planet is Merica and everyone owns a gun and Lambos are made there.

I don’t think people are buying for a quick buck.  People are buying to hold in the same way people buy and hold gold.

I’m not much of a cat person, I have to say, but that image is fantastic!  What a lovely momentary distraction from placing the noose around my neck due to my stack dropping to where it was two months ago.

I hope this crash takes Bitcoin down, and out.  A shit ton of ‘shitcoins’ don’t deserve to be hammered by this ageing and quite frankly, impotent currency.  There are far superior crypto currencies waiting in the wings.  It’s time to move on.  Let the dinosaur die out and usher in a new age for crypto.  We’ll all be better off for it.

The SEC cost me $1,000,000 when they shut down an exchange in 2014.   Who is scalping who?

He  could have just painted something like this along his car, “Bitcoin millionire over here!  Will part with my private keys if you threated to cut off my fingers.”

No, he’s saying that ...
Bitcoin is a dude, played by a dude, played by another dude.

That’s about as true as a bull run starting this month.

So we can look forward to posts like yours stopping one day?
