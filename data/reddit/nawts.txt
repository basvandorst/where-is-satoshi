Transaction fees will be payed back to the miners who process/verifies the transaction, if i have understood the protocol correctly.

The site menu is hard to navigate, since there is no way too Hoover to open the menu on a touch device, one always clicks the main category. I'm using Chrome for Mobile on Android 4.2.2

Yes, they turned up the fees to get people to switch pool and limiting new accounts. Good Guy BTCguild :-)
