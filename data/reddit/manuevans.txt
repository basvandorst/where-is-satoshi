are you being serious?
I'm still quite unhappy to lose such a large sum of money...
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:13:26
probably be REALLY happy you didn't lose the other 80...
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:19:30
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:54:22
my backup wasn't as insecure as that guy, it was encrypted, and dropbox also has 2FA...
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:22:51
Coinbase is no use if you're Australian...
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:35:08
It can't be a big fancy button that presents its self as if it's improving your security that's known to be insecure and get peoples wallets stolen frequently.
I hope you didn't lose as much as I did! &gt;_&lt;

@_date: 2014-02-01 07:19:36
i do have dropbox backup, but it also has 2FA. there has never been an unencrypted copy of my wallet on dropbox (or anywhere).
any attack on blockchain.info that could fetch my encrypted wallet should be identical to the dropbox backup.
I've never accessed any such services (ie, used that password) from my phone.
my computer has been off for over a week, and I haven't logged in to any of my accounts for months... why would they wait if they scraped my password months ago?
also, keylogging shouldn't break 2FA.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:59:50
The thing is, that might save your wallet, but it won't help the average end-users wallets. The whole concept of security needs some serious innovation.
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:33:45
I'm sure I never did that. I enter it every time.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:17:29
true, but the backups are clearly encrypted, and dropbox also had google auth.
an attacker would need to compromise my dropbox in addition to my bitcoin wallet...
or is there known explots here? and if so, why on earth does blockchain have the tickbox there, like it's no-one's business...?
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:15:44
Yeah, I really don't know... somehow I just had more faith in established services with hundreds of thousands of users, than in my own fallibility, or potential for disaster or loss of a single physical record like a paper wallet.
Cyclone/storm water damage? House fire? Failing memory? Etc...
Clearly that was stupid in retrospect, but blockchain.info presents what appears to be a trustworthy service, and I fell for it.
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:12:27
yeah. thanks.
it's quite a lot of money, i'm not actually very happy about it.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:21:39
yeah, i'm really paranoid now. i have no idea in which way I've been compromised...
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:28:51
Yes, but you have to explicitly grant permission to every app that requests root elevation.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:46:09
you're paranoid. look at my wallet, does that look like the activity of an advertiser?
i have absolutely no idea how I've been compromised, and as such, I think it's important to discuss, because if there's a new threat (or an existing threat), people need to know about it, and how to protect against it...
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:31:19
no, why would I contact gox? blockchain/wallet was compromised.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:59:29
that wouldn't defeat 2FA... and my PC has been off for over a week (I'm not at home).
why would they scrape my passwords weeks (months?) ago (last time I logged in), and only attempt to use them now? (assuming they can compromise the 2FA)
and why sweep a whole bunch of addresses in one transaction in that scenario?
I'm sceptical.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:14:38
see, it's obviously plausible, but I'm dubious.
I'm not at home, my PC has been off for over a week, and I haven't logged in to my account for maybe months...
if they scraped my password with a keylogger, it was done weeks, maybe months ago, and why would they wait? I might have moved my coins in that time...
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:58:15
It's very true... in fact, I think it's safe to say, if bitcoin is to succeed mainstream, this idea of people having control of their passwords has got to go. It's indefensible software and usability design that end users can choose and manually enter their password.
Passwords as a security concept need to be replaced more than ever.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:28:25
where from?
the only 2 locations it exists are on dropbox, and blockchain proper.
both secured by 2FA.
I've never had a copy of my wallet on any device, except the transient copy in memory in my active browser session when I log in.
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:09:22
Certainly not. I've never accessed a wallet backup, I just know they're there in /Apps/Blockchain.info/, the default location.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:23:06
what are you talking about? yahoo? well that's nice, I have no connection to yahoo.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:36:02
where do I find such a feature? it shows lists of pc's and devices that I've granted access, not nothing there looks suspicious. I can't find a raw IP log...
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:49:40
Yes. Oops, brain fart!
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:18:51
moving most of my coins to gox would indeed be an outgoing transaction...
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:21:42
why would it matter to sweep them all in one go? I don't see why that's a significant motivation to wait. it only seems like risk to wait; I might move my coins.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:53:41
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:43:39
yeah, seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:28:21
Umm, I did install a couple of altcoin miners (months ago)... are they known to be sus?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:43:10
Wow. In Australia, a pint (worth drinking) is in the realm of $10.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:42:12
on second thoughts though, it doesn't seem likely to me that I was compromised personally, since a whole bunch of accounts were swept clean in the same transaction...
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:34:11
Wow, that didn't turn out well!
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:15:22
god no!
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:51:28
but you're suggesting that this transaction represents a series of targets. why would any one of them analyse the potential attack on the next? I can't possibly predict who the next target is going to be.
I just can't see it...
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:27:27
No, I don't believe there's any chance of that.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:32:30
I don't know dropbox offered anything like that. i shall do that immediately...
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:27:52
80 coins, which is all the money I had in the world.
I transferred to gox at the worst possible time; intended to sell some off to pay off my debts when the price was high.
The funny thing is, I transferred to gox only a couple of days before my blockchain.info wallet - where I left another 5btc for spending - was hacked and swept clean.
Initially, I was just so relieved that I had transferred most of my money to gox, and that the hacker *only* got 5btc. Within about an hour of my blockchain hack, gox shut withdrawals, which I initially shrugged away; I was still just so relieved that it wasn't all stolen... little did I know at the time.
So, I got double-shafted, on the same day. fml.
I think Australian's got disproportionately screwed here. Gox is still the only Australian exchange with any significant volume, and everybody I know in this country with any bitcoins just lost all of them.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:25:00
why would it be any easier to break an encrypted wallet sourced from dropbox, then just fetching it direct from blockchain.info? except they'd also have to compromise my dropbox. you can just fetch any encrypted wallet direct from blockchain.info on request. except the 2FA thing, which they would have to compromise in both cases...
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:24:30
How could they get my encrypted wallet without breaking either blockchain or dropbox 2FA? I just don't know. I still don't see how knowing my password helps with that task.
I find it quite unlikely I am key-logged. I can't check, because I'm in a different city, my computer has been off for over a week, and last time I typed that password would have been over a month ago, maybe more.
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:09:27
I agree, your theory is plausible, but I can't imagine how.
if they exploited my PC, then it was done weeks ago, it's off and I'm not at home. why wait to sweep my wallet? i might move them in that time...
if it was the blockchain client on my phone, then surely blockchain is liable?
it rests on this, if my personal security was compromised, then it was done weeks (maybe months) ago, since I haven't logged in to any of my accounts for a long time, and my PC is off.
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:47:31
It was probably feasible to brute force, with the right algorithm.
It's 12 characters, too long to brute-brute-force, but using psychological pattern matching, it could be done, if the pattern matcher was fairly creative, and the dictionary was very creative.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:39:42
Wow, this is interesting. The email I received only contained a section of this complete spreadsheet, they only sent me around 10 pages.
So, I'm not sure I understand here... is it that rejected claims are rejected because they feel the claims were invalid? The language that was used in the email sounded to me like they rejected my claim because there was no money to distribute.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:49:45
Ah hah, I searched for my name, I'm listed twice!
One entry is accepted, the other is rejected... not sure how that happened.
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:03:32
I understand. That's just not how the email appeared. I got an accepted email ages ago, so I understood my claim was accepted. This email sounded like it was a new email related to issuing payments from the language used.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:16:04
I thought about it, but I felt it strange that they sent it to me at all. It feels like a violation of privacy of all the individuals present on the spreadsheet to share their names, account details, claims, and claim status with the internet.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:24:36
What evidence can I demonstrate? I can log into my Gox account and it lists my deposits as recorded in their database. My account was validated, they have my passport and ID on file, and they previously approved my claim.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:17:16
My account was also verified. I tried to claim exactly what was in my account, and my claim was previously listed as 'approved' from the time that I filed the claim.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:53:35
The email I received only had a small excerpt of this complete document (around 10 pages), so my initial sample was only among that document.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:32:49
This is the only evidence I can think of: 
This is a screenshot I took from the time that Gox allowed you to login and inspect the balance of your accounts during the period when we were able to submit claims.
Access to their database seems to have since been removed from the website.
My account was verified, they have all my ID and stuff. They had no reason to reject my claim.
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:59:03
There are only 3 creditors on the spreadsheet with bigger claims than me, and they were all paid in full! &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:10:30
29, game engine programmer, bought 85 coins at around $40, I'm still way up.
I stopped buying when the price went nuts... Might start buying again now though, cheap coins!
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:08:05
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:07:44
It's not his home, it's an investment property.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:27:57
Did you sell though? Surely you held, if you already 'lost everything', then you have nothing to lose by holding!
I'm confident it'll return.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:37:56
Clearly people aren't in their right mind...
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:44:53
Well if he did sell his house for money, I suspect there's a good chance he would buy bitcoins with at least some of it...
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:08:52
He listed it before the explosion. I guess he needs to write dollar equiv... I think it was just shy of 60 when he listed it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:13:14
You mean 10 tickets...
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:55:49
Yeah, I have ;)
To be fair though, it does say negotiable with consideration to exchange rate... I'm sure he'll consider any realistic offers.
