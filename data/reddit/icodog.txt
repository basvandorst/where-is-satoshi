Well, its, in theory, to explain the model in a perfect example it makes sense. If you own Apple shares early on then you probably are working there or strongly connected. Giving out equity by default is the best way to motivate people to put a lot of effort into it.

exactly, I also thought that. Like a steemit/twitter/Parteron Dapp.

hey if it be real, then i be super happy, like I said above I am always holding my bitcoin out of fundamental belief. I don't like the idea that all my money is in a bank that can decide to not give me access to my own money.

I have one 5 min from my place, that doesnt need KYC been using it for past 4 months instead of bank account. I am full time in crypto and get paid in BTC, ETH &amp; TUSD. Its 4.5% fee and its super convenient. If they would support lightning it be much better.

Can we integrate this bot into telegram? Would be very useful to tip the community on Telegram as well

I dont get why this is such a bad thing. Enough morons were buying shitcoins without having a clue about any of this. Now at least they are learning about it before they are buying it. 
I´d say props to Coinbase for bringing some education into the space.

 The startup Blockstream, which raised $101 million from Khosla Ventures and others, is now streaming the entire bitcoin blockchain from five satellites strategically positioned in orbit around Earth to reach all major landmasses.  
  
yeah this is amazing, in Prague we have a place to pay with Bitcoin instant transactions because they don't wait for confirmation, but the problem is if your internet/wife doesn't work than your standing there like an idiot. So this is essential and awesome!

I feel like the sentiment is still too positive for us to hit the bottom hmm.. Reading those comments

Yes thats correct, the purpose was also to give an understanding of what decentralized architecture is. There are some good videos by andreas but rather long. But in the end, the difference is that its much easier to motivate everybody in the system to work hard compared to the pyramid system that we have going on today.
