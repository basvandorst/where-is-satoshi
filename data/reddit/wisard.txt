Quickbitcoins.net seems to be doing this - accepting credit cards for btc. However they ask you to go through a verification process and fill a form that says you can't file for a chargeback.

Things on your website are confusing. 
1. You offer a system to accept subscription payments. But there is no details explaining how you go about it. How do you automatically pull out money from someones wallet on a recurring basis?
2. All the sample demo buttons on your website, when clicked - they give an error: Incorrect Configuration.

No they didn't launch a Bitcoin competitor. They launched a competitor to Visa and Mastercard. 
What they launched is a credit line available to bank account holders. You can pay with money you don't have yet by borrowing instantly from dwolla. And pay an interest on the amount borrowed. Essentially its Visa without the plastic.
You can't pay with bitcoins you don't have. So Dwolla credit has nothing to do with competing with bitcoins.
