Yeah the futures trading market is still just as active. It's designed to work that way. Id say about 10% of the market on bitcoin futures just closed, but its probably less. I would guess many people rolled the futures into the next months. 
That means if they owned a Jan future, they would sell the jan future and buy a feb future. (aka a roll). 
This doesnt change the number of futures contracts out there, it just steps it forward to the next month!

The longs is the same number as shorts though

I believe you are looking at the wrong website. There are two futures contracts. One from the CBOE (which you linked) and one from the CME. CME expired today. Here is the website:

Futures expire every month. There are CBOE and CME futures right now, which are off in which part of the month they settle in. CME is last friday, CBOE was last week

Futures contracts are available from the CME and the CBOE. They have multiple expirations already. This was the first CME futures expiration (the "Jan" Expiration).
They already have trading available in the Feb, march and june futures. Those have been tradable for weeks now. 
Cboe has feb march and april already available.

What about all the longs?

What do you mean?

Why do you think they are shorting it?

I am assuming most people just rolled their futures if they want to keep their delta neutral. Sure some people got wrecked by the move up, but just as many people won.
Also CBOE feb futures are pretty low volume
