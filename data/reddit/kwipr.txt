If you do what you did last year, you're not doing what you did last year.
Time rolls on.  "Not changing anything" isn't possible.

Coins will be retained, but the longer this bitter conflict rolls on, the greater the chance that BTC as a whole stumbles so deeply that it loses general confidence.  That's the real risk.

As long as the fees stay near the cost of electricity, it'll stay way lower than whatever the banks can offer, as banks need to pay people, profit, and pay their electrical bills too.

Bits as currency in Minecraft is extremely exciting.  If this catches on and thousands or millions of kids start trading in bits, look out.
Maybe what's needed to incentivize the kids is an online candy shop that sells sour keys, nibs and chocolate bars for bit?  Too bad shipping makes this impractical.  
Any local candy shops you know of accepting BTC yet?  That would close the loop in a hurry.
