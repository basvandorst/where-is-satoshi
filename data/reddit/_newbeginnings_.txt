So anyone who goes to war deserves to die and their country and its allies has no rights to try to minimize casualties? Spoken like a truly ignorant little ingrate. I wonder if you also would have felt the guys fighting nazis deserved to die as much as you think the guys fighting al Qaeda did. You are some kind of disgusting person....

What in the goddamn fuck are you talking about? How does jamming frequencies to prevent remote detonation of IED's put other lives at risk? Son, your mother should be ashamed of the person you are. Pick a goddamn side in life. Cause I promise you those fuckers you're defending would cut your dick off and shove it down your throat the moment they got the chance. Little bitches like you typing away on reddit in the safety of your little home thinking the world is equal and fair. The only goddamn reason you have that safety is cause of those men dying on battlefields to show the world that this is not a country you fuck with. And the countries who don't have armies like this? Well guess what...they rely on countries like the US to give them that safety. So think good and hard about who is fighting for you and who would love to see you dead, and maybe you'll realize there is no shame in picking a goddamn side in life.

That’s one stupid fucking statement. State secrets such as how to jam IED’s responsible for killing soldiers is not supposed to be part of the free flow of information. Yet he stole that information and made it free flowing, ensuring terrorists could make their bombs more deadly. And that was just one case. His own people revolted against him. And now so did the Ecuadorian embassy, and for good reason. He’s a fucking nut job.
