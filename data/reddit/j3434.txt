Thank you. I am slowly picking up what it is all about.

Are there Bitcom detractors ? What is the biggest gripe ? I imagine banks don't like it one bit ... get it ? One "bit" ...

Fascinating ! Thank you

Yes - I was a bit rash saying nobody understands it. But I mean nobody seems to understand why the average joe needs to understand it if they are going to jump aboard before they must !

Wow - that is interesting ! It is like a philosophy. Maybe it will work ? Is it really "needed" or just "preferable" in your opinion ? Is the old economic system problematic ?

OK I am starting to understand. Can you walk me through a simple - general - step by step of how I would ( starting from scratch ) send 200 German Marks from Milwaukee, Wisconsin  to my Uncle in Berlin ? Do I need to "Log-in" or sign up ? Does he need to do the same ? Who give's me the "OK" ?

That is a concise explanation. Is there an advocacy to recruit Bitcom users ? It does not seem like there is. It really sounds as simple as making a ebay account. But it is not being promoted as far as I can tell. You just need to entice individuals to make their first few Bitcoin transfers !

Thank you. This is interesting stuff. I really just didn't get it - but i think i'm coming around.

Makes sense ! Of course I must trust that the algorithms are as flawless and incorruptible as they claim.

Does the bitcoin movement anticipate large influx of clients ? Do they desire this ? Or do they deem themselves elite ? With some fortune to be made ?

Nice - thank you
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:31:56
Nice. Thanks

I could not open link on my tablet. It does not appear as a clickable link.

No comprende 
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:31:25
Ok that makes sense. From a philosophical point of view - it seems like it may be inevitable to embrace this type of economic foundation in the fulness of time.  
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:06:44
Is there any money to be made off of bitcoins ? Is there some way I can profit off of promoting this ?
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:07:56
Wow. Now I'm really confused. That is the problem with bitcoin currency ! NOBODY knows what it is - what it does - or where it comes from.
