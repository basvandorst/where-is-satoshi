Do I need to have an offline computer to create an offline wallet?
Or could I create one on a usb/dvd rom and store it in safe places?

I can see it when I insert it into my computer and then see the file. How do I test it properly?
erm, yes I am using bitcoin QT, that bad?

Unlikely, litecoin has risen against the USD.

What if you bought 'chips' with bitcoin and it is held in the cloud. All decisions come from a consensus agreement of players on the network but not at that particular table?
Couldn't the random number generator be created by other non table players who don't even know what table they are generating for?

My thoughts on this are that you have the long investors (like my friend and I) who will buy when it dips below a certain threshold. People like us help keep the value.
Then you have the seller types that have made a lot of money early on.
Then you have the day traders who will tip the balance, right now they haven't decided who's side they are on. However, a few positive indicators will start a chain reaction towards new highs as they all pile on, creating awareness and new buyers.
I think the lesson next time there is a bubble is to brace everyone for the inevitable crash afterwards, no panicking, no suicide hotlines, just a level headed look at the long term picture.

ah, thanks.

So wouldn't it be fit for poker? I mean, it can be played fast but it's not like your aiming a sight at someone while they are trying to dodge you.

You can't judge what someone knows just by looking at them. Your probably right though, I wouldn't want to bet that 60% of random people have heard of bitcoin. I still think it's much higher than 0.1%, it's ridiculous.
Not many people actually have good information about it though. Personally I heard of bitcoin way before I bought simply because I was given bad information on it, they said it was backed up by the dollar which I knew was fiat and therefore not interested.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:40:28
However, is this issue a easy to fix?
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:45:52
yeah, I've got my bitcoin for more savings purposes. So I've backed up my wallet with bitcoin qt. Would it be okay to delete the wallet.dat on my computer now?

I can't thank you enough, that was extremely helpful.
Just to clarify that when you said there are 18btc for sale at 710. Do you mean 38btc?
Thanks again.

I just don't have an offline computer or anything in that nature:(

I think it's quite realistic. There's been very high profile articles about it, especially the BBC report on the guy that threw away a shit load of them and is searching a landfill in the hope to recover them.
 My mum, sister and my grandad have heard of it. They have no idea what it is but they've heard of it.
A policeman I was talking to knew what it was but thought it was all about drugs and assassination bounties.
A lot of people know about it but there's a lot of misinformation out there.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:08:35
well said.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:17:01
Good point, couldn't you make the same argument with gold? which increased dramatically after the 08 crash.
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:12:24
Why shouldn't/couldn't bitcoin implement anonymity?
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:56:52
And damn lucky it was. When bitcoin hit 450, I jumped out of my window, lucky I live on the first floor.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:45:59
When you say 2nl to 2knl, are you converting bitcoin into dollars? Why not just go with denominations of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:50:56
I am sure your getting a lot of good advice and I'm not the best person to speak to when it comes to bitcoin but my advice would be to make a tiny purchase first before piling that kind of cash in. Just to make sure everything is running smoothly.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:43:37
I drew a line like this in math class once. Shall we compare that to bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:47:56
I currently play 50nl across 8 tables on stars/party poker. However, I was looking into a bitcoin site.
Q 1. Do you have support for poker tracking software such as holdem manager?
Q 2. What stakes do you currently incorporate?
Q 3. What is your rake structure? Q 4. What rakeback/promotions do you offer?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:16:40
Guess how much money I pledged?
69 dudes!
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:03:40
bitcoin will become death (of fiat), destroyer of worlds.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:50:15
No, it's not that expensive. I guess the vendor is hoping people won't do the math. This guys a street vendor, not a fancy restaurant.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:26:08
I got a question...The bitcoin china exchange will crash right? So wouldn't that be a good hypothetical point to find the floor?
