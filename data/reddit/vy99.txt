So is this a new bot or something?
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:05:33
Yeah it is.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:43:05
How was it a hit piece?

For those that don't know these machines are in grocery stores all around the U.S.
They were made for fiat coins but now you can buy Bitcoin from them...so this is huge for adoption!
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:10:07
Right but generally you treat a stock and a currency differently. A stock is an investment only and you hold onto it until you can make money off of it. A currency is used to exchange goods and services. You wouldn't sell your country's currency if it suddenly increases in value, but you would sell a stock if it soars.
Where Bitcoin will ultimately lean we don't know for sure, but I know a lot of people started down this path because it seemed like a good alternative to modern currency but we're now at the point where it's becoming more of an asset that people buy/dump based on the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:14:52
In the long run the hope for many in the community is that it becomes less of a stock and more of a currency...but the FOMO took over in the last year and it sorta morphed into something it never was intended to be.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:35:19
That it's a scam
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:58:36
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:43:04
You scoff but a lot of people invest that way.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:40:19
Well yeah, less of a chance for upstart altcoins to make their name in the market and threaten Bitcoin's place in the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:33:38
Booo this man! BOOO BOOO BOOO
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:19:50
This is pretty good reading for those that are just getting into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:22:52
So much for the NSFW tag
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:16:57


I have a feeling we're supposed to sit here and ask all excitedly what he found so he can have a chance to shill what he needs to shill.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:50:58


...and I'm sure his opinion isn't formed in any way shape or form by what he read on the internet
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:09:41
Creating an account just to crap on us all...well, aren't you a brave little toaster.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:49:18
I think everyone can benefit from Cryptocurrency but I especially think it's beneficial for people that aren't in strong economies like Venezuela and Zimbabwe where the currency has become almost worthless over the years. Since Bitcoin is decentralized you don't have to worry about a government screwing up your life savings.

For those that don't know The Globe and Mail is the big business newspaper in Canada, similar to the Wall Street Journal.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:58:21
Can it still be "BREAKING" if it was last week's news?
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:50:25
He's gonna need all of it since his career is pretty much over
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:18:54
I believe the cool kids call it "hodling" and that's what I suggest you do.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:06:58
This is a common problem in courts today...especially when the Supreme Court is ruling on tech matters
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:43:10
I don't think anyone has been 100% correct, but to my knowledge John McAfee (don't laugh) was the first public figure to be truly bullish on it.

I once paid $60 for one pizza in Switzerland.
Sidenote: Switzerland is hella expensive.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:40:52
In some ways though they achieved their purpose and got way more publicity from temporarily being on NASDAQ...so it's almost irrelevant that they're getting delisted now.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:26:51
At least he can't keep up with the charade any longer.
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:32:18
and that money was used to buy a pizza
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:44:51
Ride the bitcoin rocket
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:58:04
I'm going to go ahead and say yes
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:40:36
If this notorious scammer says something isn't a scam...
this might be the first time I'm worried about Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:34:21
Have the money to invest in it
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:20:23
Found the banker guys

You probably saw this:

Every fire needs a spark. Liechtenstein can be seen as an experimental test and other countries will take notice if it succeeds there.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:21:55
There's probably more people who have Bitcoin than those that still have a QR code scanner.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:34:25
This joke blows
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:54:23
I don't need to check the price, one visit to this sub and I know what the price is every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:20:34
I love how Canada seems to be leading the crypto way instead of the US that seems to be retreating.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:52:36
Really? I used to need an app for that, I don't have it anymore so I just assumed I can't scan QR codes.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:10:01


Anytime someone says that ask them how the people of Venezuela (among other countries) feel about how much their currency is worth now.
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:30:50
You realize he still uses AOL email right? His lack of tech experience has been a running joke for years.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:23:38
We also know that Square will be accepting bitcoin too
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:33:11
Just hoping that if we see it enough it'll come true!
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:28:03
If only I bought when it was at $100
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:51:44
34CHF = $60 CDN...or close to it
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:30:45
Hope she's able to retire right out of high school!

Banks have been doing this for years, one of the reason I avoid using debit cards as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:50:50
Lotus of Siam has got some great Thai food!
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:21:14
So...cash has never been used to buy drugs???
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:35:22
I...don't know if Bannon being on board makes me feel more secure about Cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:45:25
It was a matter of time, they always update the intro with the latest/greatest in tech
