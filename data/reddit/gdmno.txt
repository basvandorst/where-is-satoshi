Oh man I love it when scrolling on a page does something completely else than scrolling on all the other pages on the Internet. Makes me totally want to use it again.

That sounds super illegal.

This is actually a huge potential use for the blockchain. Imagine how many contracts people have to print out, sign, have notarized and snail mail back. This would be a game changer.

Yes. Any kind of trading which does not involve Bitcoin moving from one address to another undermines its purpose.

While the price of bitcoin is completely kidnapped by exchange operators who do pretty much the same manipulative shit as the big banks we all hate.

I dont think basing it on loans taken is a good idea. Scammers could just get enough karma to get the minimum loan amount, take out a couple loans, repay them, and then steal the maximum amount.

Yeah, I mean on a mainstream scale. Majority of gold sellers do not have the ability to deliver. As weird as that sounds.
@_date: 2015-04-11 18:02:58
Sure it can be done but it will never be done because there is way too much paper gold compared to physical gold.

These have become synonymous ever since electronic trading and especially leveraged retail futures became a thing. Did you ever have any of these online Forex / Commodities trading platforms? The position could be down 100 times the size of your account in the time it takes to dial your number. They do not call you, they just liquidate.
