like i left that password live -- and -- who cares?   
someone was going to "beat me to the login" to get 0 BTC? 
like that would have been their plan?

yes, i knew it was a too good to be true story, but i thought that there would be an approval process before engaging with this Benjamin person, who just called me personally complaining that his FB profile had been blocked.

hey, can you explain how i even gave this stranger money?
the person knew my wallet ID and nothing more. that is the part i don't get. 
also: i have changed the password close to 10 times -- and it looks like this person simply has access to the wallet. 
how is that even possible?
i was curious, that is a legit reason to engage. i know 0 about cryptos and i guess i'm getting a crash course. 
but, what is a bit concerning is that there appear to be movements closer to .5 BTC now in that wallet. 
i can still access the wallet -- but i can't "do" anything with it...

sure, please send me your wallet and password so i can deposit my coins.   
PS: even if you did that, i would not steal.

can you explain to me how on earth this person gained access to my blockchain wallet?
i thought those wallets were "in only" and not "out."
that is why i engaged with this person. also, if i can save a soul from being a con-artist, i will do so.

i went public via facebook live and i think someone scammed me out of btc 
now there are "non-spendable" btc in my app wallet -- but not in the online account
a man going by Benjamin Gerald asked me to fund my wallet and said he could get me 3x return in 24 hrs. 
it's my first time so i figured i'd have some fun...
i put $137 in ... you know what ... i am going to make a separate post:

can you explain to me the point at which i "gave" this person my money?
i thought crypto walletIDs were "in only"
to transfer money out, you would need the password.
please point out the time-span this person could take money out of my wallet -- and how it could have happened (ideally technically). 
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:47:13
if you are so wise, please explain how this person withdrew from the wallet without knowing the password.
next: how are btc going in and out of this wallet, without my authorization -- after i've changed the passcode and set the authorization to 2-step?
next: why does 2-step authorization only sometimes work? (i turn it on and sometimes it sends the SMS messages, other times, it just stalls. when it stalls, i log in via the app and re-gain access)
please answer those questions to confirm your wisdom.

honestly, do you think i "believed" the 2-3x return promise?
1. i changed the password on the wallet
2. i figured out how to fund the wallet
3. i purchased &amp; put in $137 worth of bitcoin
   1. someone tell me the process of buying BTC with hand-written notes and ID's and all that jazz is not an incredibly goofy purchasing process
4. so i did all that -- and knew that i had changed the blockchain wallet ID password.
   1. at this point, i told the Benjamin person that the wallet was funded. but i'd changed the password like a day prior. maybe even more than a day.
   2. Benjamin did not have the password
5. i expected to be put through some kind of approval process -- where i'd "allow" access to the BTC -- that did not happen
6. the BTC amount was transferred out of my wallet
7. i have a growing amount of "non-spendable" BTC in that wallet
