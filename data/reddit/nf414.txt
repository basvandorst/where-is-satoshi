Answer: price to high. Question: Why are you genuinely curious about that?
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:23:45
wise decision, congrats
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:19:17

What an A'hole!
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:03:25
to the downside i assume..
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:45:43
I don't get your answer, please explain.
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:43:36
Thanks for the advice, but it would be too high as in 'it will go down' ;)
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:00:34
Well, good luck with it then..

You do not have to insult me, do you? The people who have made fortunes, did not create Bitcoin did they? Of course they should be taxed. Taxes are for the people btw.

That much was clear from your post. But WHY are interested in what the average person who has not bought in yet thinks?
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:03:27
DEFINITELY DON'T buy up in this way overbought area btc are in right now! we are way up in an exp. growth-curve. This rate of growth is unsistainable. If you believe in bitcoin, which you may or may not do, at least wait for a SOLID correction. Full Disclosure: i sold all my BTCs at 372$ Today. 
And remember: most people are deluded by a bubble, so dont let them get you, thats the nature of the beast.

Wow, good luck with that. How long are you looking to hold this?
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:57:15
May i ask what your average entrance-price is?
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:53:11
Great, Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:59:21
I did buy them at 173$.

Source of that story? And i hope they tax BTC! People should be taxed since many made enormous amounts of money by doing essentially nothing for society.
