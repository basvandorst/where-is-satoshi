HMMMM... NO NO NO!

1000% in a matter of weeks? That's never actually value, that's a shitcoin being pumped. Tron for example.

This guy did the math.

If Bitcoin crashes all the coins will be affected. And for god's sake don't "cash out" into Tether either! They have created 355 million new USDT in December alone (thus far).

Essentially you can bet money on what the price of BTC will be some time from now. You can either go short (bet on a lower value) or go long (bet on a higher value).  
MAY affect the Bitcoin price via arbitrage.  
Not to mention that you can obviously also buy or sell Bitcoin to affect the price of the thing you're betting on.

I believe it once I see it. People said that Segwit will fix all scaling issues a few months ago.

You have to take the price into account as well. Better think in mBTC.  
So what? A thousand times that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:16:39
Maybe it's advantageous if you hold BTC as well since you can influence the price somewhat.

They MAY however indirectly affect the price. Which they already did by going up directly after the lauch of the Bitcoin Futures at the CBOE.

FOMO got you good. Don't fret. In a few years you will look back and cry about how you didn't buy more at 17k. Or at least see McAfee eat his dick. Either way, you win.

Amazon bought Twitch 3 years ago? I thought that was earlier this year. Damn time is glitched again. @_date: 2018-02-07 08:53:29
We would not even be talking about BCash if it were not a fork of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.

I don't see the funny part in that.

My bet is on Mercury. Decide for yourself if that's good or bad.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:23
I'm not even worried. I'm trying to figure out if I should buy more now or wait for it to go down even more.

We are soo far away from decent quantum computers.

I'm honestly not so certain about that. With ETH eventually moving away from mining, many small miners could transition over to ETC. Though I would personally prefer to have them switch to Vertcoin.

I'm guessing you usually have that lid closed and can therfore not provide us with a 24/7 livestream of those miners?

We have emojis and profiles. Reddit is turning into Facebook, isn't it?
