Use this formula:
priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
Once that is &gt; 57,600,000 then you are good.

I'm not sure I understand. Why would it not be enforceable? The amount of tax you pay for sales is completely different from any capital gains or losses a person incurs. I'm also not understanding how a person would not know their purchase price.

The currency used by Counterparty (XCP) is only used "to create new assets, make bets, and perform callbacks on callable assets."^[1]
"No one really wants to have to transact back and forth into this currency." 99% of users would never transact with XCP. There are only very few cases where XCP is needed.

Thank you for the clarification.

I have been using counterparty for a while now and I have to say they are doing an amazing job. There have been a few issues here and there the past few days but they have actually got something out and running. There are a number of platforms that are already using the platform that will only help it grow.

I don't see why they wouldn't. The biggest issue with the last discount is people over at SlickDeals (at least that is where I saw it) learned that you can pay for something that is worth $500 with $499 USD and $1 BTC. I think until this loophole gets fixed we won't see any more major deals.

You will need to wait until it is out of the mempool.
Contrary to what many people are saying here, simply sending it again with a higher fee WILL NOT WORK! That is not how the bitcoin protocol operates. There have been some people who would like "replace-by-fee" transactions but many people, including gavin, are opposed to it.

It is simply how the network is setup to prioritize transactions:

I think you should also balance it out with some of the issues with bitcoin. While it is a great innovation, I think it would be unjust to only promote the positive aspects of it.

The best option you have is to send it to Eligius as they accept non-standard transactions:
Or simply wait until it has been released from the mempool.

Yes, this is a great point to add. Don't want to end up sitting and waiting when your client is sending it out again and again.

As time goes on, the inputs continue to get older as more and more blocks are found. Eventually, the transaction will get a high enough priority that it can be sent without a fee and then it will be included into a block.

It is not possible to do this in the bitcoin protocol. It has been written but the idea has been rejected, for good reasons, by many of the devs.

That is very true. I agree that if its the same transaction inputs and outputs but just a higher fee that would be a great implementation. Unfortunately, that isn't the case at this point.

I'm looking at the https and its giving me dogecoin wallet: 
I like the thought of being able to us dogecoin as well!

Not if it is sitting in the mempool of the machines on the network. The network will reject it.

At this point too many people still see bitcoin as an "investment" and nothing more. We are still early and it will take time for that mentality to change. Until then, I think we'll continue to see things with disclaimers about being "invested" in bitcoin.
