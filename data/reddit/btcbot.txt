Uh... governmental policy or bank failure?  Governmental policy bailed out the banks, true.  The banks broke the law during the Greek real estate bubble and over-extended themselves with CDS's, etc. so that they required bailing out in 2008.

I'm an Electrum user and have the bulk of my coins offline in a wallet that has never been opened while connected to the Internet.  I try to use it as little as possible, because it's a pain in the ass to move coins.  I keep a hot Electrum wallet for purchases, but never keep more than 10 or so coins in it.  
Here's the basics of the system:
I boot my PC into a Unix USB device (Tails, but Live works, too) to access my offline wallet, after pulling the ethernet cable.  I just think this is silly for most people and the real risk - the one nobody here wants to talk about - is that I'll do something stupid and lose coins.  
De-centralized banking is a fantastic achievement, but human error, sloppiness, and laziness will trump our beautiful system every time.  
I'd suggest that if you're ready - to experiment with small amounts and offline storage of some sort.  
Big picture, though, as someone who actually trained my spouse to boot a Linux computer in the 90's and get it onto the Internet - that all this is going to be a bad memory at some point, a series of instructions that will seem painfully ridiculous and that the benefits do not outweigh the risks of human error.  
EDIT: Talking to my spouse: she just told me she had found those Linux instructions the other day and could not figure out what they might have accomplished.  Technology!

Well, since you asked...  ;-)
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about Syriza in Greece, a movement that started as a grassroots movement. Now they have taken power, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. And then you have Spain right now. We recently spoke to Pablo Iglesias, the secretary general of the group called Podemos, that was founded, what—an anti-austerity party that has rapidly gained popularity. A month after establishing itself last year, they won five seats in the European Parliament, and some polls show they could take the next election, which would mean that Pablo Iglesias, the 36-year-old political science professor and longtime activist, could possibly become the prime minister of Europe’s fifth-largest economy. He came here to New York for just about 72 hours, and I asked him to talk about what austerity measures have meant in Spain.
PABLO IGLESIAS: Austerity means that people is expulsed of their homes. Austerity means that the social services don’t work anymore. Austerity means that public schools have not the elements, the means to develop their activity. Austerity means that the countries have not sovereignty anymore, and we became a colony of the financial powers and a colony of Germany. Austerity probably means the end of democracy. I think if we don’t have democratic control of economy, we don’t have democracy. It’s impossible to separate economy and democracy, in my opinion.
AMY GOODMAN: That was Pablo Iglesias, the head of this new anti-austerity group in Spain called Podemos, which means in English "We can." The significance of these movements?
NOAM CHOMSKY: It’s very significant. But notice the reaction. The reaction to Syriza was extremely savage. They made a little bit of progress in their negotiations, but not much. The Germans came down very hard on them.
AMY GOODMAN: You mean in dealing with the debt.
NOAM CHOMSKY: In the dealing with them, and sort of forced them to back off from almost all their proposals. What’s going on with the austerity is really class war. As an economic program, austerity, under recession, makes no sense. It just makes the situation worse. So the Greek debt, relative to GDP, has actually gone up during the period of—which is—well, the policies that are supposed to overcome the debt. In the case of Spain, the debt was not a public debt, it was private debt. It was the actions of the banks. And that means also the German banks. Remember, when a bank makes a dangerous, a risky borrowing, somebody is making a risky lending. And the policies that are designed by the troika, you know, are basically paying off the banks, the perpetrators, much like here. The population is suffering. But one of the things that’s happening is that the—you know, the social democratic policies, so-called welfare state, is being eroded. That’s class war. It’s not an economic policy that makes any sense as to end a serious recession. And there is a reaction to it—Greece, Spain and some in Ireland, growing elsewhere, France. But it’s a very dangerous situation, could lead to a right-wing response, very right-wing. The alternative to Syriza might be Golden Dawn, neo-Nazi party.
@_date: 2015-07-04 13:43:18
That's a good point, but the crisis was less about a dearth of competition and more about the change which happened over the past decade which allowed banks to invest in high risk investments (CDS's), often as collateral for other CDS's.  (And yes, I'm talking out of my ass, but as an amateur economist, it's my right).  
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:05:04
Yes, this guy has been fucked by the capital controls.  I don't know who set the ATM take out limits.  
Bigger picture this is the secondary wave of financial collapse from not cleaning up the 2008 banking system meltdown, but instead allowing the banks to paper over their losses with more financing.  
The IMF themselves have said in a report that Greece will never pay off their obligations.  Blaming Tsipras or previous Greek governments for the banking crisis is simplistic if partially true.  The entire EU is swimming in debt and it's just a fact, although not well-reported, that a lot of that debt, if not most of it, is from the recent bank bailouts.  
The MSM austerity narrative is that Greeks are lazy, don't pay their taxes, and waste money on early retirement.  While not entire lacking in truthiness, it's just not the big picture.  It's the banking system itself that has captured the world - not lazy folks spending their socialist-free-healthcare-free-fajita-bucks.

Thanks for that.  No mention of the bank bailouts at all, though.  
Since March 2010, the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have applied 23 tranches comprising €206,9 billion to the so-called "Greek bail-out". They have however provided hardly any documentation on the exact usage of those huge amounts of public funds. ATTAC Austria has therefore put up an investigation on the issue: At least 77% of the bail-out money can directly or indirectly be attributed to the financial sector.
The results in detail:
€58,2 billion (28,13%) were used to recapitalise Greek banks – instead of restructuring the too big and moribund sector in a sustainable way and letting the banks' owners pay for their losses.
€101,331 billion (48,98%) went to creditors of the Greek state. 
€55,44 billion of these were used to repay maturing government bonds – instead of letting the creditors bear the risk for which they had received interest payments before. Another €34,6 billion served as incentive to make creditors agree to the so-called "haircut" in March 2012. €11,3 billion were used in a debt buyback in December 2012, when the Greek state bought back almost worthless bonds from its creditors.
€43,7 billion (22,46%) went into the national budget or couldn't be definitively attributed.
€0,9 billion (0,43%) were used as Greek contribution to the new bail-out fund ESM.

Libretardian fantasies aside... No.  You're wrong... that's the MSM narrative that the 'lazy' Greeks wanted to retire at 50 and never paid their taxes (which is lol... a bit true).  The bulk of the debt is a result of the bank bailout from 2008 and its subsequent refinancing.

Yes, it will be a short term capital gain or loss if you're a US citizen.  I keep a spreadsheet of all of my transfers, as you have to declare FIFO (first in, first out) for your old coins.  So, if you've got a cold wallet with a 100 coins in it and you send 10 newly-purchased coins to America, your cost basis will be the first of the 100 coins you bought (which could make them long-term capital gains if you've held them for more than a year).  I am not a CPA, nor a tax attorney - this is what I do, given my research.

Conflicts of interest are endemic to professional life. How professionals deal with them is what makes them professionals. But that’s just the beginning of a story that has banking circles in New York buzzing. The episode suggests just how much bank bashing has become a fiscal racket.
Did a prominent, politically connected advisory firm, Promontory Financial Group, go easy on its client bank, Britain’s Standard Chartered? Promontory had been hired by the bank’s outside lawyers to help comply with an Iran sanctions-busting investigation. In emails produced by New York regulators, Promontory is seen changing wording of its final report after objections from the bank. One email says “the most important thing is that we get to the end of the project without jeopardizing our relationship” with the client.
Then again, such glimpses inside the sausage factory can be overinterpreted. Standard Chartered was the client; it had a right to be consulted. And, at the end of the day, Promontory’s work did help to produce what would become nearly $1 billion in fines and settlements paid by the bank.
But another kind of conflict of interest may be implicated. New York’s Department of Financial Services was investigating Promontory for two years. Negotiations reportedly broke down over Promontory’s unwillingness—along with paying a penalty—to acknowledge wrongdoing and accept a suspension of its ability to work with New York clients. (Reputation is important to such firms.)

That’s when the New York agency issued an official yet informal report citing vague derelictions and effectively banning Promontory from business in New York by prohibiting local banks from sharing non-public documents with the advisory firm. This action came barely one month after the agency’s flamboyant chief, Benjamin Lawsky, who launched the investigation, left to create his own private consulting firm to compete with Promontory.
There’s more: Mr. Lawsky is a protégé of New York’s ambitious Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo created the New York Department of Financial Services, appointed Mr. Lawsky to head it, and publicly delighted in the $5 billion revenues Mr. Lawsky’s aggressive enforcement generated.
Promontory is run by Eugene Ludwig, connected to a rival power center in the Democratic Party—he was Bill Clinton’s law-school classmate and a top U.S. bank regulator in the Clinton administration.
Now you know why banking CEOs and lawyers in New York are in full gossip mode. The battle here smacks at least partly of rival networks of Democratic fixers fighting over a regulatory protection racket.
Regulatory actions against banks began in response to public demand for villains after the 2008 financial crisis. Now they have morphed into institutionalized revenue grabs. Every few months seems to come another “settlement” of real or imagined sins, in which billions are transferred from bank shareholders to the federal government and state treasuries. Gov. Cuomo himself has jokingly called the windfalls “a gift from above.”
Along the way, lesser sums land in the pockets of lawyers and revolving-door fixers who attend the racket, not to mention the campaign kitties of influential legislators. Promontory, with its retinue of advisers including Securities and Exchange Commission ex-chiefs Arthur Levitt Jr. and Mary Schapiro, is said to have earned $54.5 million for its work with Standard Chartered. Maybe this figure caught Mr. Lawsky’s eye when he decided to hang out his own shingle.
All this will seem impossibly weedy to some, but banking is risk-taking; without risk-taking, there is no investment and no growth. Bureaucratic overkill inevitably has become a factor in our slow-growth recovery.
If a bank makes a loan and the loan goes bad, regulators may come with charges of fraud. If a bank makes a loan and the loan doesn’t go bad, regulators may find it was too profitable at the expense of some protected minority class or other, as seen in the “disparate impact” crackdown on banks that provide wholesale backing for loans auto dealers make to their customers.
If a bank takes on a new client, the bank can be liable if the client engages in a verboten transaction. As part of its settlement with Standard Chartered, the New York regulator insisted on being consulted on every new demand deposit (i.e., checking account) opened by the New York branch. You can bet New York isn’t taking responsibility for culling out worrisome customers but will jump on Standard Chartered with more fines if any turn up after the fact.
So the biggest conflict of interest may be between the American people—their notions of freedom, their hopes of prosperity—and a regulatory state that increasingly operates to benefit itself.

The poor guy hasn't lost any money yet.  The 'haircuts' have yet to happen.  He's just stuck - only allowed 60 euros a day to withdraw from an ATM and obviously that's not enough.  All online banking has been stopped, too.

I'm guessing he's got a hospital bill or mortage due and reached his daily 60 euro take out limit.   
Slightly off-topic but possibly pertinent to Greece - if you're interested in what might happen with a complete currency collapse, check out this Argentinan blog about living through the 2001 collapse.  You'll have to dig around for the good stories, but jeez... he writes about the clever survivalist rich folks who lived out in the country, surrounded by criminal snipers who poison their guard dogs and kill the folks that leave the house until they could just storm their 'fortresses'.  He makes the entire story seem like the Walking Dead.  Shopping was like 'making a run'.  It's a chilling story about what could happen if Greece defaults and has to re-adapt the drachma.  
@_date: 2015-07-04 13:55:04
That's the MSM narrative of the lazy Greeks.  The bulk of the debt isn't from fat pensions, it's from the 2008 bank bailout.

Frankly, I think the expectation within a lot of the BTC community is that the leveraging which occurs in the shadows of these exchanges, will benefit the next bull run, as much as it has benefited the shorts in the last 2 years.  The money-laundering taint that BTC has been subjected to, which causes so many ease of obtaining issues, is nothing compared to what we expected legally in 2010-2012, before government's essentially said, 'Ok, whatever...'  Many of us feared full-blown banning of the technology.    
We can blame the KYL/AMC hoops we have to jump through for the slowdown in adoption, but I suspect the real reason is that people really just don't believe it's going to be that big a deal.  I suspect that the Backpage crowd will ultimately create a huge new user base, as the Black Market Economy (which is expected to be 2/3 of the global economy by 2020?) moves to the BTC platform.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 12:29:52
As others have posted, this is bullshit until 2140.  We have extremely high inflation now and it is likely affecting the exchange rate.  3600 new coins a day added to the money supply.  The difference between bitcoin and other currency regimes is that we know that there will be a limit to this inflation.  
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:41:54
It's my understanding from the Guardian article that the bulk of the debt was from the bailout, after the financial crisis caused by the Greek real estate boom of 2003-2006, of the banking system, not from the well known profligacy of the Greek government.  I may be wrong, but that's what I understood.

I finally found the answer in their faq.  Passport cards are acceptable but not passports because passports do not have state of residence info on them.  I'm done with them, too.

If you go back over the thread on bitcointalk, you'll see mention of a guy who had 'access' to practically free electricity and that something had happened which had either coerced FC into hiding or had harmed him.  But I don't remember mention of a name, although all the crap Google translations didn't help.  
EDIT:  Just to clarify - the rumor was that Jihan introduced him to an electricity thief which led to FC getting busted or killed.  
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:42:54
The rumor at the time from bitcointalk was that he was the guy who introduced him to the electricity thief that got him killed or jailed.

For those who don't have the bigger picture - only 10% or less of the 254 billion euros Greek owes was spent on pensions and social benefits; the vast majority - 230 billion - went to bailout the banks.

[Electrum: Cold Storage Tutorial](
Main principle is that the wallet is run in watch-only mode online and your seed is never typed on an online machine.  This means all transactions will be signed offline.  Use Tails (or another Linux portable OS) and pull your ethernet cable physically out before running Electrum offline.  Run your offline wallet to sign transactions that you have created with your watch-only wallet and saved unsigned.  Sign them offline, save as text and then import them into an online machine for broadcast.

Right, but it's common practice to share the xpub to create 'watch-only' wallets.  If someone were to get one of those and a private key - all of the addresses would be compromised.

We were just talking about it... she just smirked.  She's kept me from making bad decisions before, as I'd been involved with penny stocks for years; she got me out of NeoBee with a 80% return because she'd said that the pic of Danny and the developers looked really weird (like they hadn't been paid?).  
When Reddit started accepting it in 2013 she got gung-ho and was more like, "Do we have enough?"  It was never about the tech; I'd been a subscriber of the CypherPunks list since Zimmerman got harassed and that was cool.  It was the idea of sending my ID's to some site in Japan that was scary and $750 was a month's rent (I'd just been laid off the year before and was trying to make it freelancing).    Sameo problem...  they're still too hard to buy.

been doing it since 2013 and it works great.  i use tails offline without a wallet.  i recreate the wallet every time i need to use cold storage to sign a txn.
@_date: 2015-09-14 10:58:08
Just go slow, then...  set up cold storage and a watch-only wallet and put a few bits in it.  In a couple of weeks, try moving them or adding to them.  All of these techniques should be approached cautiously and methodically - after all it's real money.

First read about it on Slashdot around 2009, immediately downloaded some mining software and started mining.  I hated the way it made my computer sound and my fan was already wonky.  So I uninstalled it. I then tried to buy some, the price was around $1.50; I was going to buy 500, but my spouse told me I was just gambling and not to send my ID's to some wonky site in Japan.   Finally got in early 2013.

Looks like he's correlating a stock shares issuance of a new company which might have been a division before, (not a split) with this fork, which is not really similar.  A stock dividend of shares of an offshoot company  typically maintains its total value as a composite of the two shares.  The offshoot company does great and the mother company goes down.  
This is a new system of coinage, so it would seem, to me, to be more of a dividend without a cost.  (Say the stock goes up after issuing shares of its offshoot because the vibe is it's doing so great that it is able to do that).

You're going the hard way - and you need to do your own research through the wiki, etc.  But here's a quick way to get up and running easily and securely.  Get [Electrum]( and write down your 12 word passphrase.  You now have  wallet that can be recreated from this phrase, has no need to be backed up.  You can learn about paper wallets in the meantime.  
Send your coins to one of your Electrum offline wallets... Dun.
