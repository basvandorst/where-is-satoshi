eBay is a service.  TigerDirect showed that people will hop along at any chance to spend Bitcoin on a legit site for any number of reasons.  Paypal almost has the market cornered in online transactions, and they're doing just fine with growth.  eBay is struggling at best.  Paypal could be bigger than eBay in 10 years, maybe 5.  Cryptocurrency in general is an attack on Paypal's craptastic system.  I don't see them wanting it to be successful.  
Paypal is to VISA as eBay is to Target - Elon Musk.  Paypal is online transactions.  eBay is an auction site.  It's logical to me which one would be for using/accepting Bitcoin and which one sees it as a threat.

I've never used a Google wallet nor had the desire.  Honestly, I don't even know what it is.  However, I *do* understand that Google basically runs the world.  That's why I said Google would do it in general, but for me personally I think Amazon would have a bigger impact.

How long you been internetting?  Overstock is an old, generic dinosaur that got left in the dust by Amazon and Ebay.  When they started accepting BTC, I'm guessing a lot of people were like me and said "Oh damn, I kinda remember them."  I figured they went out of business years ago.

I think cryptocurrency is what is gonna kick Ebay and Paypal in the asses.  In five years, they'll either be accepting crypto or out of business.
What people are really gonna be surprised about is Apple.  It seems they've taken a stand against Bitcoin because Apple loves their complete control of everything.  Apple won't be out of business, but they'll be hurting if they don't change their (i)tune.  And it looks like Bill Gates is accepting of Bitcoin.  Gonna be interesting to see how that plays out.
These companies BETTER jump on board or they really are gonna face big losses.  I think Google understands this.

ARG I can't remember but I saw someone mention something on Reddit that talked about this.  It was some idea a scientist or some &lt;insert smart sounding career&gt; came up with.  Basically, anytime you're reading the newspaper and you find an article about something you know a lot about, you can read through and point out numerous mistakes the reporter made because they obviously don't understand something as much as an expert in the field.  Then you flip the page and read the rest of the paper and believe everything in it.
EDIT - Someone beat me to it, and it was a novelist.  Not a scientist.  But a novelist IS a smart-sounding career.  I mean, Leo Tolstoy, James Joyce, Faulkner, Upton Sinclair.  Those are some smart folks.  And the sci-fi genre has guys like Arthur C. Clarke and Carl Sagan.  I'm hoping by the time you finish reading this you'll forget how bad I butchered my first comment, and I'm only leaving it there because of legitness for not hiding your misposts.

The other share that is halted from trading right now is COG.  The Bitcointalk thread has out their pitchforks to get the COG guy arrested.
So I'm not saying this is the end of N&amp;B, but it is definitely something to look at.  Word is someone from N&amp;B account got hacked and shares were being sold too cheap.  Okay, what if my account gets hacked and someone sells my shares too cheap?  Are they gonna halt trading for everyone because of that?
As someone else said, something smells fishy.
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:17:03
It's all good.  I just did a big 20 page report on eBay's history, legal issues, industry trends, all that jazz, and ended up spending about a quarter of it on Paypal alone, which is much more interesting.  Amazon has overtaken eBay and they're struggling compared to where they've been.  Paypal, on the other hand, is exploding, which is amazing because I use it and think it's a piece of crap system.  I think they take about 10%, and then eBay gets their 10%.  Such a crap system.  I'm crossing my fingers that Amazon turns into the Bitcoin player between the two, because I think eBay and Paypal are on a very slow downward spiral.  Amazon has been innovative as hell.  They were the first to really push mobile purchases, which is a very simple innovation - fit more items on the screen in a higher resolution.  eBay is just now getting around to that, while mobile purchases have been through the roof for the last couple years.  And then you look at what Amazon did with their e-reader.
I also think Apple is headed toward a downtrend, and I think cryptocurrency will play a part in that.  And I'm talking 20 years in the future.  Apple's policies are just shit, and I can't believe they will continue to be successful, no matter how much marketing they do to keep Apple products the "cool" choice.

But it's very interesting and I just like speculating.  Just do some googling on "ebay paypal split" and you'll get that whole story.  Paypal has almost no competitors, other than Square who recently started working with Bitcoin.  As much as the general public likes to ignore Bitcoin, the big industry giants are definitely taking notice.  It won't be some giant celebration where the media explodes with stories, it'll be a quiet little tip of the iceberg.  They hate it because they can (and should) potentially lose money, but the technology is undeniable.  I think that's called a catch 22.
Sorry for the rambling, I was fascinated by this topic.  And yeah I talk in absolutes but I obviously have no clue.

And Paypal is showing exponential growth and could (and probably will) get bigger than eBay.  Paypal wants to split because they think eBay is slowing them down, and that's probably true.  My bet is that eBay wants to use Bitcoin for moar profits and Paypal is very against the idea, because realistically Bitcoin is a direct competitor to Paypal.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:49:54
Impossible.  I think we would recognize the same face on a person.  One of them wears glasses.  I've never seen glasses on the other.  So your theory is out the window.

Reddit "still in the red"
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:12:04
eBay owns Paypal, but they have separate CEOs and they are just getting over a huge rift between the two, where the Paypal CEO wants to split off and the eBay CEO is like "whoa, we can't lose them."  Paypal is about 33% of the overall profit for eBay.  Former Paypal co-founder Elon Musk compared eBay owning Paypal to Target owning VISA.  Basically said VISA is obviously bigger than one store, and Paypal is bigger than eBay.  eBay IS holding Paypal back from bigger and better things.  All that said, it looks like the split talk died down, although there was some ultra-investor who is probably still trying to make it happen.

^ This.  But the thing is, what have I ever bought from Google in the first place?  Amazon is the big player to me, then EBay.
Wouldn't Google lean towards Ripple over BTC anyway?
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:20:55
Prediction - GoogleCoin.  I'd watch out for some sort of Facebook or Google currency using similar technology.  I guess similar to what Ripple is doing (which I'm sure most know was "invested in" by Google).  I could see Google bringing Ripple along slowly, then hopping on it.
If there's a cryptocurrency for Youtube, Google, and Facebook, I'm thinking the general public is turning to that over Bitcoin.  That's my only worry.

I'm just gonna say that 1) I don't think Paypal will ever accept Bitcoin and 2) I don't think we want Paypal to ever accept Bitcoin.
I know Paypal is the big thing right now, and we watched them slowly build from the Dot Com Boom over the last 10-15 years, but in 2014 moving forward, they are effing jurassic.  Bitcoin is the future.  Paypal is already yesterday's news.  
Paypal can die the slow death that company deserves.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:52:11
I think most businesses at this point are cashing out instantly.  That's kinda the kicker.  For a cryptocurrency to really work, ideally we wouldn't want companies immediately switching to fiat.  But that's just the way it is right now.  From a business owner's standpoint, I think the best reason to get into BTC right now is for potential marketing and to get a grasp on how it works out in the long run if/when it does take off.  You might have to take your lumps but you'll be a step ahead of others in the long run.

It's the logical next step in currency and technology.  Wal Mart and Apple will be taking it one day.  Maybe 5 years, maybe 20, but it's obvious.
I'm new to cryptocurrencies, and one thing I would've liked to know is that there are all kinds of cryptocurrencies out there.  And some sort of explanation on the algorithm, which I still don't completely understand.  All I know is "hey the government uses the same type".

I'm going to ask my (probably dumb) question on here, too.  I'm looking at getting started, and I think I understand the Qt client.  I can buy from an exchange like Coinbase, then send the BTC from their digital wallet to my Qt client on my computer.  But if I wanted to do one of those printed hard copies of a wallet, what do I do from the client on my PC?  Do I generate a wallet number for the offline wallet and then send the BTC from my client to the number somewhere out in the interwebz?  Doesn't the receiver of the BTC have to accept/receive the money?
I guess I just don't understand the whole printing of a paper wallet, or how to send to an offline wallet.  In the tutorial link posted, it says to load a bootable copies of Linux but you end up saving absolutely nothing onto the device.  Where is the wallet address stored?  Is this like a MAC address kinda thing where the BTC is saying "We recognize XYZ has 1 BTC whenever XYZ gets online."?
