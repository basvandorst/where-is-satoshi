So even then that has nothing to do with BTC other than they are using "Crypto"
Until you can buy a cup of coffee with BTC it's just a speculative inflated bubble IMO. 
For all the shit the Ver get's he actually tried to do something about the scaling / fee's issue.
I don't trust any of these people anymore, not core, definitely not Brock and not Ver.
There is way too much "money" at stake for any rational improvement in the tech.
I mean in the end all you're buying are glorified SSL certs. That's it! 
Also agree, LONG term BTFX/USDT imploding is going to be a positive but it is going to rip apart the current price.

He did his homework.. look into it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:56:48
You are a fool.. nothing personal.. Why is it going to go up if you don't mind? I'm genuinely curious.
Is adoption increasing?
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:01:01
How do you buy milk and bread in Venezuela with Bitcoin?
Also people buying petro crypto in Venezuela has ZERO to do with BTC so no.. that's not utilization increasing.
Are more and more places accepting Bitcoin and I'm just not hearing about it? 
I don't think it's an elaborate scam either. not at all. But the current price is not justified by anything other than there are just a bunch of suckers out there that think so.
Once Bitfinex / Tether blows up... look out.
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:33:27
I agree.. it is not the mother of all scams.
Fees need to be addressed. Period. If BTC want's more use cases you need to be able to buy a cup of coffee with it.
Speaking of use cases what are they? Dream? what else... speculation? and maybe store of value.
Electricity really comes down the scaling problem. Chinese miners I think are just the financial reality rather than some cartel but I highly doubt the original vision of mining is in line with what has come to be.
Scaling and fees are issues that have to be resolved. I haven't been following it much over the past several months so I have no idea where lightning is but I think the Devs have really just been focused on memes about lambos and pumping.
I'm sorry but in my view this "experiment" has gone off the rails because of greed. It makes you think about the almost necessity of centralized decision making / control.
Leaving it up to the "market" has gotten us to where we are and in my view.. it's not fucking good.

If you read through his testimony and you are honest with yourself.. he is mostly right.
I don't think the Bitfinex/Tether thing would "Kill" bitcoin either but it would absolutely murder the current price if it implodes (just a matter of time IMO)
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:19:47
You are all morons.. this guy is 100 percent right.
Shit is going down.. like SOON.
It's already down overall so it doesn't matter but it's gonna be a bloodbath when Bitfinex and Tether are exposed for what they are.
You're obviously not paying attention.

Crypto has absolutely fuck all to do with the stock market. The stock market has companies with earnings and... oh whatever I'm not even gonna bother with that one.
Everything has changed for the worse! There are now umpteen forks of Bitcoin. If a chain of cryptographic hashes has value then all the other "shitcoins" provide the exact same thing.
Yeah yeah.. network effect whatever. I still can't buy a fucking cup of coffee with it. or anything for that matter except dope.
Saturation is NEVER going to happen at this rate because of my point above.
The older younger thing.. this one is SOOO dangerous and bugs me alot. It's like the younger generation thinks they have this miracle money machine that's going to make everyone rich because they understand technology.

When I performed my deep underlying Technical Analysis of the current price metrics, I forgot to divide the nonce by zero and then carry the satoshi.
BTC will be at $1,012,533.06 by 2-19
It's physics. It's inedible at this point.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:13:56
This is 100 percent correct. It's not going anywhere but the price is going to take a gigantic beating (as it should).
Anyone calling the bottom is just guessing. My personal guess is somewhere above 1K maybe like 1200 and then it's going to go sideways for basically forever until the dynamics change with adoption. If it does break 1K though I wouldn't be completely shocked.
The Tether / Bitfinex fiasco hasn't even really hit the mainstream thought. Anyone that thinks Tether and Bitfinex are legit are completely in denial IMO.
My other predictions while I'm at it is Bitfinex Implodes and they exit scam after Tether completely collapses.
The other USDT exchanges are most likely exposed and I would bet once BFX goes that some of the others will come down with it. It's almost as if nature / market forces are going to clean up the space for us rather than government enforcement etc..
All the other alt coins are probably going to end up somewhere near zero I imaging except for the ones that actually have use cases like Monero, ETH, probably DASH, LTC etc..
Either way BTC will definitely survive long term really no matter what happens with everything else. People that say it's dead don't understand how it works.
Forgot to add that the likes of Brock Pierce and the boards at BFX / Tether are going to end up in prison unless they can somehow escape capture.. THAT is going to be fun to watch.

I hear that and I have seen weirdness with them pretty much every single time I've done a transaction.
It went through. The mempool was through the roof as everyone else was doing the same thing since the price popped.
If it was coming from Coinbase then I'd blame them but this was from Electrum to them. Electrum even showed it unconfirmed.
Not uncommon either way.
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:59:14

He's going to lose 2/3's of his current investment.

6 months tops probably 3
I was going to add that he should SELL NOW but it looks like I was too late when I checked the price.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:00:21
This is masturbatory crypto porn.
About an hour maybe an hour and a half ago I submitted a transaction to move a measly amount of BTC from my local Electrum wallet to my Coinbase Pro account.
Guess how many confirmations have cleared in that time?
Unless Lightning proves to be the best thing since sliced bread Bitcoin isn't taking over shit.
Sure.. I can buy mediocre quality, overpriced drugs online with it. But really, that's about it.
I know this is hard to believe but the government is more afraid of people getting burned by scam ICO's and losing their life savings to a speculative bubble. That's where they are acting.
They are not actively trying to kill crypto.. They are waiting for most of them to fall flat on their own faces.

The guy from the SEC said an ETF is basically a pipe dream?
Bitfinex is dropping the Tether peg / people can FINALLY redeem it for the low low price of 3 points per million?
Maybe it's "ICO market is dead" by Barry Silbert?

They won't.. They'll have to shut them off until that market corrects as well. The difficulty will go down for sure.
The "mining floor" that everyone is bringing up lately is a myth.
How did they cope before when it crashed 90 percent is probably a good place to look.
I hate to say this but this whole crash is actually a "good thing for Bitcoin"
It's going to shake out the traders. Clean up the miners. Destroy Bitfinex and Tether. And put us right back to 2016 which from my view is right about where the technology is upgrade wise.
Lightning was proposed in 2015. There was a whole bunch of upgrades that needed to happen to get there that has taken a very long time (democratic open source is obviously VERY SLOW)
I would imagine the mining / hash rate is going to match numbers from around 2016 as well.
This whole pump price has setback the whole project by 2 years. Everyone got caught it up in the price and memes.
Look at this hash rate chart over the last 2 years:
Miner's we're profitable 2 years ago. What happened is that when the price exploded mining exploded.
Those days are gone. There's just naturally going to be a lag between the hash rate falling with the price.
As you can see the hash rate has indeed fallen dramatically since the crash started.
There's way too much mining power at the moment so those are going to shutdown drastically in the next few months once they are all underwater. They already are.

me me.. I do.
Can't remember if I had bought at that point though so it obviously wasn't a significant amount either way.
I remember when I REALLY got involved in the space the price was hovering around $250 to $500 and it was actually still profitable to mine personally, although barely.
I do remember specifically thinking that when it hit around 1K that I thought it was crazy and waaay overpriced.
We all know what happened next.
Maybe 2013ish is when I started monitoring the price regularly?
Before that.. I was "aware" of crypto but not really paying attention.

Buffet has literally never EVER chased a bottom. That's literally the exact opposite of his strategy.
He looks for long term profitable companies with dividends. I've made a ton of money following Buffet's line of thinking in the "real" market.
Plus.. what data leads  you to "believe" we are at the bottom?
Was there some report on utilization going up I didn't see?
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:56:12
I'll admit.. it held the price overnight.
I was fairly confident it wouldn't but I was wrong.
I HIGHLY doubt it's going to head back near 5K and it seems like it's struggling to hang on to 4.2K
Time will tell.
Either way.. my whole position is that the Tether / Bitfinex crap hasn't even been priced in yet. Whether or not people choose to believe that Tether is on the up and up and that Bitfinex is not having any issues other than "banking issues that all crypto companies deal with" that seems to me that you either believe them or not. I personally don't. The investigation that just kicked off is the tip of the iceberg for those guys.
If BFX manipulated the market with Tether (common sense and evidence points to yes) and BFX is unable to process withdrawals (there is a literal SMORGASBORD of evidence on reddit about this) then that is going to be a complete DISASTER.
That's where I'm getting my estimates of 1K 1.2K probably even worse like $800 or god knows.
Full Disclosure: I absolutely believe in the tech. It's not going anywhere. These issues are not going to "Kill" crypto. Killing crypto is essentially impossible, the genie is out of the bottle. That's the beauty of the tech. 
Just my 2 bits so to speak.
