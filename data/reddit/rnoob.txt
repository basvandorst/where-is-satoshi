I scanned a QR code for my address and checked to make sure everything matched. The correct address is on the receipt from the atm. Hopefully the bitcoin will show up in my wallet today. I will update this if I do not receive it in the next few days. Thanks for the feedback.

Support finaly contacted me back and they said I sent them a bitcoin cash address. They said the address needs to start with a "1 or a 3" but all the address in my electrum wallet start with "bc1".. Do I need to use a different wallet or is there a setting I am missing?

Thanks for feedback.

Yeah I feel the same way. I haven't seen any bad reviews about national bitcoin atm but I feel like it shouldn't take this long. I quadruple checked my bitcoin address and everything is correct. Getting kinda frustrated, smfh

I emailed and called them yesterday about 4 hrs after I made the transaction, they said they would get back in touch shortly. I called this morning and they said they would mark it as urgent and someone would call me back in a few minutes. That was over 2hrs ago and still have not heard anything. 
The receipt didnt say "failure or success" but it has all the pertinent information for a completed purchase on it.

I recieved the bitcoin about 2 hrs after I updated them with a legacy wallet address. 
Thank you for the input
