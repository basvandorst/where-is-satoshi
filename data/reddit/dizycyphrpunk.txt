I would say PoS has more security; I disagree with the notion that the security matches how much it costs in electricity. Security is simply how difficult it is to break the system, and in this case PoS has had more success. I can list the coins 51% attacked because they were PoW with low hashrate, yet no PoS cryoto have been successful that I know of.

Well ETH is going to it eventually; that should tell you something. It's actually more resistant than POW. People just say it's not proven because it hasn't been around as long as bitcoin. When's the last time a known POS coin was successfully attacked? I can list the recent POW attacks.

Why does it need PoW to be permissionless? There are plenty of permissionless PoS. ETH is going PoS, does that mean it will suddenly not be permissionless?

bitcoin confirmation times are extremely backlogged right now. If it goes unconfirmed for long enough, you can pay a bigger fee and try again

I think it's gotten this high only once before at the beginning of the year

which PoS hasn't survived a 51%? Source?

I like this one better. (The fact that the trend lines are curved and not linear actually makes the price history fit).

Gemini all the way for me. I made my first trades with Coinbase because it was the easiest to start. I don't regret it because I wouldn't have even been able to enter the market when I did if I started with Gemini. But once you have your bank verified in Gemini it allows $500 deposits per day (being able to withdraw within a week) compared to Coinbase $2000 a week. Coinbase has credit card deposits, but only allow $150 per week which i find pointless. Coinbase price to trade and send is a lot higher as I've heard. Coinbase app is great to use, but I use Blockfolio now to watch many more coins.

Let them do whatever they please. Any regulations just improves the mindset that people need more protection from government
