Ooh, this might be the winner. I was futilely hoping Trezor had some similar functionality. 
BitStamp and Stripe offer something that might work, but I don't need to convert the coins except rarely.

Yea, not trying to hide anything except have people on the fence thinking that I have enough and they don't need to donate, or donating less than they ordinarily would have. 
There is also the competitive aspect of advertisers or potential partners being able to negotiate better from projecting revenue easier.
I tried to raise funds with bitcoins in the past and I'm learning from those mistakes.

Yes, that makes sense. Can obfuscate in JS for all but the most hardcore looky-loos. Or could call something serverside on another server, but I want to keep it permastatic for security reasons. Wordpress makes my life hell.
I still can't find a good JSfiddle showing this process of deterministic receive addresses. Any idea?

I think this and the electrum solution might be the easiest to implement. Thank you for your suggestion.

Thanks. Looking at your query. I've seen the BitcoinJS, but not the other stuff.
I'm surprised nobody has done this yet. If you look at a site like: 
You see it is absolutely transparent, and that's a good thing, but I think there is a negative side to it. If I'm a donator, I'm going to see that the coins have just sat in the account doing nothing. The coins very well could be the straw that allows them to get started on something, but it can be uneasy all the way around knowing to much information.
My use case is similar to patreon. I see with many creators there is a wall of maximum revenue, and I can't help but think it is better blind initially. You can put fundraising totals later, but it could be better to never discuss this. I subscribe to a few indie creator's networks and podcasts and I genuinely hope they make as much money as possible.
