Shit hes going to need protection, there are a lot of nasty people out there who will be salivating at the thought of all the knowledge in his head. And $400 million in stealable bitcoins.

Also - how can you tell Im shadowbanned?!
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:31:51
Tried again... Looks Im Shadowbanned and will be euthanizing this account! 
Annoying that you cant find out why or try and get reinstated.

I had a very similar experience, its not easy to buy a bitcoin. The only people who will be interested currently are very persistent speculators who are looking to cash back out of bitcoin into fiat.
Every day use as a currency seems far off when it is so difficult to actually buy a bitcoin.

Really? Since when? I had this issue a while ago, contacted them and all I got were variations of "I dont know". 
Am I shadowbanned in only certain subreddits?

Enough people never do it though, the majority have no idea what a bitcoin is.

Ah Ok thats why my comments sometimes get through! Looks like Im going to have to kill this account as they dont reply to my messages.... Weird!

This is the only problem with Bitcoin. I am actually fairly technical but it took me a long time to be able to buy a bitcoin (registering with mtgox, bitstamp so on took 1 week+ and I had to send in passport scan etc).
Until Bitcoin is easier to use I cant see it progressing. Hopefully it will become easier.

Hitting a brickwall trying to find out why/how to remove it.
It seems people can see my comments (like you) so Im at a loss. Maybe start a new account is the only option.
Mods dont reply or reply back with variations on "i dont know"!
