Lmao Gemini is NOT hard to use pls stop complaining man, Jesus it’s like you gotta be retarded not to know or LEARN how to use Gemini 
Everyone just wants things too easy man, can’t take the time to learn something then get out of crypto

I was gonna ask the same thing. I wanna be able to withdraw to my bank without being difficult and Coinbase has been easy but really hate their support. Can Gemini do the same?

How do I add screenshots! I have some but I can’t find a way to upload them, new to reddit sorry!
Same here! All my business is paid through here so I’m actually excited if they make more than just selling and buying!

As of now, you can only buy from your Bank Account and Sell, no option to have someone pay you in Bitcoin or anything like that! But I’m sure if this works well, they will push that feature in the future

Yeah what sucks though is that you really can’t do much! Can’t transfer to Wallet or anything like that. Very very limited from what i can see but IM HOPING this is the beginning for Companies like Square to get into Mobile Cryptocurrency Payments/Transfers
