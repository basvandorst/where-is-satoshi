I'm questioning why he would even go on record as confirming anything?  He doesn't validate anything by doing this, just saying that he's seen bank statements.  He has zero background which anyone can find besides buying a truck load of coins before they skyrocketed.  Not sure what it is about him either but I don't trust the way he speaks.  : )

I heard Scorcese has already signed on to direct this tragedy and John Goodman will play the lead.

Agree with Point  HFT firms have caused catastrophic collapses and then rebounds on numerous 'regulated' products.  It happens everywhere.

Use translator buddy, otherwise, learn Chinese, it is from China.

I've seen this guy in 2009 practically guarantee that the Dow was going to crash (it was at 10,100) at the time.  Granted, people make bad calls all the time and if you make enough of them you are bound to hit one but I brush off any talk of huge price swings up or down, just let it be.

Yeah, silly comment dude.  Smart merchants will convert directly back to fiat when they receive btc. Unless these merchants are in the business of speculating on currencies/commodities, then they will convert asap.  If they indeed are in the business of speculating, then good luck in whatever product you decide to speculate on.

Excellent idea, way to get creative ANX.

Second Market can give you access to pre-public shares if they ever go that route.  But a straight up investment in those companies at this time would be extremely difficult.

Large purchase can be made by non wealthy people, just use margin.

Is this ATM in the restaurant only accessible when it's open?  or is the restaurant open 24 hours?  or is it located externally?

Sounds really cool guys, but a few questions:  
Where will the current market rates come from?  Completely based off of ANX prices?  
How long is the time frame to choose if we want the BTC?
Is extensive ID required?
Thanks guys, well done, I'm excited to hear more from you in the future.

Loving these things, this one isn't your best though.  Seriously people, relax a bit, it's a comic.

Seems I'm the first to comment!  As a career trader myself, this is huge!!  Loving the new trade screen, click to trade is my fav (auto populating) and the multi cancellation feature is tops.  The portfolio screen is really awesome as well, massive UI upgrade to any other exchange I've used.  Great work guys, you continue to impress.

There is one in Central, not sure of the exact location and there is one at the ANX office in Wanchai, search results show it's 200 Gloucester Road, Suite 701.

I'd go Bitstamp or ANX myself.  Bitfinex and BTCe are taking a backseat.
