It is now. But some other coin might turn into the most decentralized one.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:35:45
BTC still has the name and first mover advantage. How long that'll last - nobody knows. But I would be surprised if it's still  coin two years from now unless the LN gets deployed. 
And "we just drop" BTC doesn't happen overnight. Also, if BTC drops, it might create a lot of fear in the market and crash all the crypto.

You are making this world a better place. Thank you. There are enough spoiled brats and millionaires who'd never think of helping others - great to see you're not one of them and actually want to make a difference instead of hoarding more money than you'd ever need.

LN is many months or several years away from being implemented and adopted. Of course, the market doesn't care that 1 company launches it. It's a great proof-of-concept scenario but it's pretty obvious it won't have any market impact.

Damn, that's pretty rough. In my country, you just pay higher tax rate (20% instead of 15%) and a fixed fine (which isn't that high). Unless we're talking really big tax evasion of course. Would you go to prison even for not taxing like $100k?

There's a difference between market being in a bubble and market dying. If you believe that the current upward trend is sustainable forever then power to you and good luck - maybe it's the first ever market where corrections don't happen. 
Do I believe in crypto being the future? Definitely. Bitcoin? Not so sure. Either way, I'm not naive. When my grandma who barely understands what Internet is asks me to buy her some bitcoin, I feel like something is about to go down.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:40:46
Not at all. I invested in bitcoin 4 years ago (feel free to go through my post history to find posts from 2013/14) and made crazy profits. I've been through the Mt. Gox crap and much more and held. But I am wary of what market is doing right now. 
And yes, I withdrew part of my coins recently. But am I mad? No, as I don't have any reason to be. I made more money than I ever thought out of Bitcoin. Cryptos are the future one way or another. Is Bitcoin the future? Not so sure about that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:55:24

I just don't see a reason why not to use *insert almost any other 3rd generation cryptocurrency* instead of Bitcoin. I do realize it's got the brand and being first going for it, but there really are much better, easily scalable coins with faster dev teams right now. As much as I always loved Bitcoin, I feel like it's starting to lag behind right now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:40:33
Network effect assumes that bitcoin would actually be getting an increase in use cases. But 99% people (I pulled that number out of my ass but it wouldn't surprise me) just buy it to get rich and never use it for anything. It's definitely in a bubble right now (though I can easily imagine this being the actual correct valuation sometimes in the future, after it goes through a painful correction/bear market). The only question is whether it will pop at 20k, 50k or 100k. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:51:13
His analogy is actually pretty good. It seems like what you're trying to say is that "bitcoin works as intended and there's no reason to change anything". But there's a lot that needs to be improved if it's supposed to be successful.

I used ShapeShift when I was using Exodus wallet and I consider is pretty useful. I know nothing about politics that you guys are or aren't involved in but the service you provide seems fine in my eyes. You also responded quickly to a support ticket I've had regarding one of the transaction not going through (I thought I won't be seeing my money again when it happened and was relieved your support actually works). 
So, nothing wrong with ShapeShift in my highly subjective opinion.

Could be wrong, but I got it here: 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:46:42
I only use it to check prices of Bitcoin, I sold my Bitcoin Cash a couple weeks ago. It has a nicer interface than Bitstamp or whatever and the prices are correct. The fee thing caught my mind though. 
However, I was moving my Bitcoin today and had to pay $5 fee for my transaction which already is atrocious.

Nobody sees this rising anytime soon. It just happens, or it doesn't. Bitcoin definitely isn't for everybody and if you're going to buy it and then constantly check price and get uneasy when it goes down (which it does, all the time - check graph for last 3 years) then it's not worth the investment. Either buy in for a long-term and believe it's going to get adopted or invest into something less volatile with more stable (albeit lower) returns.

@_date: 2017-06-01 10:49:53
I know this is rather hard to answer but would you say there's a chance of big up/downswings happening on and after 1st August? Would there be any reason for such thing?
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:00:39
I see. So it doesn't matter which one I use though, right? They both are going to lead to the same address?
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:58:32
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:43:38
Aight, thanks for info.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:31:38
I am from Europe. I did not really think about it all that much yet though.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:25:29
Really? I never looked into it much since I never used it but I thought it was hacked. Do you have any reliable sources for this claim?
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:51:43
You're the boss :-) Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:33:49
May I ask where do I get transaction ID?
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:39:14
Yup, me. Even tho this is 7 hours after you are askin'.
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:08:00
Cool-ey. Thanks bud!
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:29:07
I use BitCoin Wallet (the original one). Thanks for answers!
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:57:55
If I manage to get to my account and transfer my balance (1 BTC), will that work? Or do they need to confirm it somehow? I'd rather have it in safe place.
@_date: 2013-11-02 13:05:23
Fucking hell. I wanted to start with BitCoin so I can get away from dumbasses such as PayPal, and this sounds exactly the same. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:43:16
Awww. I wanted some kind of crash-insurance. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:37:47
Lol. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:39:29
I wonder, how much BTC you already made by that?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:42:26
Because they are missing in my original account. And because I checked the address I am sending to. Also, my BitStamp account was showing number of confirmations (0/3), however it disappeared now and is nowhere to be found.
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:59:13
But there is limited number of BTC to be mined, isn't there? What happens when they are mined out?
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:25:51
Why would you say it is not worth speculating? Thanks for the guide, by the way. I am having a look @ bitcoinpaperwallet.com and so far, I like it a bit more.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:26:33
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:40:36
Ah, no problem. Excuse me, I'll set up the generator right away then! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:57:27
I see. Any way to see how my transaction is doing?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:20:25
Well, since I am 650 USD shorter, I would assume it was sent. Anyways, what you are saying is that the second I sent it, it would show up in receiving address page on BlockChain (even if it was still not confirmed). Right?
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:02:41
Clever. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:52:12
Looks like I found what I needed then. Thanks bud!
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:27:25
WTF just happen?
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:07:18
I misunderstood you then. I thought that you think that 25% of world accepts BitCoin. Because I'd say that even saying 10% of world knows what BitCoin is would be pretty optimistic. 
But soon. SOON! Bwhahahaaaa!
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:45:15
Cool-ey. I kind of want to be ready to sell my BTC quick in case it drops, and LocalBitCoins just doesn't cut it for that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:31:58
Screw them. From the time I was using PayPal for trading, I have more horror stories than ever. I always thought stuff I read all around 'net were just fake and gossips. Until I made account there. 
I am not kidding that my first freeze happen after FIRST transaction I got (later I found out they have something like "radar" for your account, and in case you get unusual transaction - too big, from weird country, and so on) - it will automatically freeze it. Anyways, I then uploaded all the documents and they unfroze it again. Then they froze it like 3 more times over maybe a year (which may not be a lot, but realize that it usually takes at least a week or two to get rid of it). After a year, they froze it permanently without explanation. I called their support (which is I am 100% sure outsourced, because I got replied by some guy with weird accent who was just parroting some bullshit from their TOS). He also told me they can't tell me why it was frozen, because it is against TOS to tell me... why my account got frozen (what?). 
At the time it got frozen, there was around 500 USD. Now, I am a student - so keep in mind that was a lot at the time. I started spamming them with emails and after some discussions with their escalation centre, they then were so nice that I could withdraw my funds 2 months later. 
And in case you guys do not believe me, I have tons of emails I will be happy to screenshot. 
All in all, I thought PayPal can't be that bad. When I started using it, I found out they are much, much worse. Stay away unless you have to use them.
**EDIT1** 
One of emails I got from them is here, for example - 
My email to them is the bottom one, reply from them is above. This was the last freeze before they suspended my account (3 days after I got this) - it was never unfrozen, they just escalated it from frozen to suspended.
And here is another one with proof I had 531 USD frozen by them - 
**EDIT2** 
Oh, and I just realized. I got chargebacked for a total of maybe $400 and they NEVER sided with me. All it took was for the scammer on the other end to say I did not deliver (it was IT jobs, so I have no receipt) and I could provide them with messages from him, work I've done and so on - they always just sided with him. So tip for some easy money - go ahead and fill a dispute with some poor soul on PayPal - most likely, they will side with you, even if you got everything you were promised. 
And as a bonus, they charge you some bullshit $20 fee on top of that (I believe that is only when you get chargeback, not when you lose a dispute - but I do not remember to be honest.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:17:27
Anyone has any experience with  How is it?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:40:44
I transfered it from dAgensia.eu account to BitStamp account.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:39:42
I see. Hopefully that's what will happen then, I'd rather not lose my BTC 30 minutes after buying them, heh.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:05:46
Alright, thanks for info. Suit is indeed reassuring.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:02:15
So super-impossibly-theoretically, since some BTC was for sure sent to non-owned public addresses (by mistakes), if you were incrediblly lucky, you could generate a private key that actually unlocks them?
I realize the chance for that is astronomically small. Just food for thought.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:33:29
I know I sent it there. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:43:33
So it is alright if I create my public and private key offline? When I send BTC to the offline-created public key, it will arrive there? And eventually, when I need to withdraw from it later and use my private key, it will work? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:02:06
I exchanged 650 USD for 1 BTC on dAgensia exchange. Then I sent that 1 BTC from my dAgensia account to my BitStamp address. No need to be dick about it, I am new to all this and I am trying my best to explain.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:37:32
I don't mind verifying myself. If you say BitStamp works fine, I guess I will give it a shot.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:51:56
Got it now. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:23:05
Thing is, it disappeared from the "incoming transactions" thing. I can't see number of confirmations it has. Another cool thing is that I bought it for $640 hour ago and it is $520 now...
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:42:02
Alright, that definitely helped my horribly newbie-panic. Hopefully that's true. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:23:08
I used my funds on PayPal to buy material, so I couldn't withdraw it all. However if you do not do that, I agree. 
I did not know about the chargeback process, so thanks about that. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:49:05
Czech Republic. Russian mob?
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:49:31
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:09:56
Cool. Is the any site from which you can buy BitCoins with debit/credit card? Or just bank transfers?
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:08:15
There won't be miners when all BitCoins are mined out...
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:34:25
Yeah, this time with actual proof on BlockChain. Since last time I was accused of not sending anything and whatnot. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:50:03
I see. So basically, every possible address exists in blockchain, and you can send money to even non-owned addresses. The catch is that you need private key to unlock those funds from them. 
Very vaguely said, is that right?
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:07:40
It was BitStamp. But yeah, address is right.
@_date: 2013-11-02 11:47:07
How is that possible? They can freeze your account?
Do you mind uploading a screenshot of that?
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:15:28
Yeah, I already lost 150 USD from yesterday because of their delays. I don't like the way they don't even say shit about it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:05:16
Yeah, and my problem is different now. Reason it wasn't sent was because of fault on dAgensia side. However, it was sent today at 10:00. It is 15:00 here and since they said they need 3 confirmations (and it has 17), then yes, I am getting slightly nervous, since I put my first money in BTC, and it wasn't small amount for me. Sorry for taking your valuable time, but I do not force you to read or reply to my questions.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:24:25
I mean the code you need in case you lose access to your phone. Normally, there is a "backup" code for when that happens, so you can bypass the 2-F authentication with it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:35:52
Honestly, as long as it is JUST delayed, fine. What I am afraid of is that they somehow lost it and I lost $650.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:18:57
Cool-ey. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:27:55
Yeah. When money is in the equation, they should act responsibly. This was my first BTC purchase ever, and I honestly think of returning back to fiat before I even tried anything with it, because of this bullshit. $650 ain't exactly small number (and I am sure there are people with bigger numbers and no responses).
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:50:25
THOSE PEOPLE ARE USING BITCOIN ONLY FOR ILLEGAL THINGS, THIS PROVES IT!
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:43:51
Hm, I see. I'll give it a thought.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:10:13
I have sent it, because on BitStamp, I could see it in Incoming Transactions for a while. It appeared there and had 0/3 confirmations, so I thought I would just wait it out. I checked 10 minutes later and it was not there anymore, neither was it credited to my account. So that is what my problem is. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:34:58
I probably worded it wrong. I mean the types of comparison like I linked in my OP. That's just stupid. 
And yes, I promote discussion, even $1000    posts. As long as they are discussing something, not just posting some stupid movie gif. How does that look to someone new to BTC who comes here and sees stuff like that? It would definitely make me turn around and run away from this currency.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:42:50
So you'd rather see me not saying a thing and pretending all's good? I think that newcomers (such as me) actually should know that BitStamp can't handle their clients. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:19:31
Ugh, I see. So if I have public address on BlockChain and send BTC there from different places (BTC-E, LocalBitcoins, BitStamp) and then send 1/2 of BTC I have on BlockChain to my paper wallet, the other 1/2 will be vulnerable? Do I get it right?
