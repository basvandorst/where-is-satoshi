OK. So I'm starting to get it now. 
* Intersango acquires bitcoinica from founder Zhou Tong after original hack
* Intersango are incompetent in resolving bitcoinica customers claims
* Bitcoinica, now run by Intersango, have numerous further security breaches showing their technical incompetence
* Unrelated, Intersango has its bank account at Metro Bank suspended. Slowing their daily transactions, dropping them out of the top 5
Well my take on it then, one hour in after posting this is that Intersango-exchange is actually hack free, secure and OK to use. Where Intersango-bitconica is a clusterfuck.

plug successful! Looking forward to your report.

How are they involved in bitcoinica? I thought that was some guy in Singapore(?) who was trying to withdraw a load of money in last week's drama?
Are Bitcoinica and Intersango the same company?
Again - if there is a post somewhere that details all this I would really appreciate it.

thanks blakdwag for such an eloquent reply, everything you say makes a lot of sense. 
Just because I've had "good" experiences with Intersango in the past doesn't mean their without (many) flaws. You've raised some very relevant points ty.
I'm really quite new to this game, only first converted GBP for BTC in May. At the time there were two reasons I chose Intersango: 1 they're Brits and have nice professional b/w photos (yes I'm that shallow)... but more importantly I really don't like the idea one exchange has so much power over the ecosystem.
Anyway for now I'll switch day trading to Mt.Gox GBP - Thanks a lot blakdawg &amp; everybody for your replies. I am enlightened and I hope others are too.

Yep, on all platforms you'll find something.
I use Dropbox to store the database so it's synced across everything easily too

Well he got a payout: 80 coins

£500 a week via blockchain's Pingit? although that will take 20 weeks, who know's where the price might be by then.
Edit: a word.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:24:05
wow £80 per BTC... fuck that -
maybe next week that'll seem like a deal, right now it's farrrr from a bargain

I singled out whatandroid because as soon as I read this post today I opened Blockchain on my SGS3, first time in a few weeks. 
As soon as it opened, it refreshed &amp; registered the latest balance in Blockchain app: I had a totally random dialog window pop up saying WhatAndroid had crashed and had to stop, click OK.
I was like wtf?! I haven't used whatandroid in nearly 2 weeks, but it had been installed after Blockchain. Why the actual fuck did I just get a message right then and there. I've never seen whatandroid crash before and never seen this dialog.
Now my device is intentionally not-rooted, but it does make you wonder if it was rooted my balance (all of 0.42BTC) would have been nabbed.
Now I'm not one for conspiracy, and it's probably just coincidence but pretty worrying.

You need to let us know what apps you have installed. 
Do you use any torrent apps? Whatandroid for example? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:18:12
There is definitely something sketchy going on between those two apps on my phone. 
Just relaunched whatandroid and then opened blockchain again and I get an instant crash on whatandroid everytime. 
I tried it the other way (opened blockchain, then launch WA) and managed to get a crash report out of whatandroid with a little dialog popping up "downloading wallet".
I'll take it up with the whatandroid devs
