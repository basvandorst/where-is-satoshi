Have there been problems with coinbase over the last few weeks? I've got a buy with them pending from the 21st Dec. I've bought with them before and had no problems.
To make it worse it's literally impossible to contact their support. Their email address bounced back, their FAQs don't seem to mention any delays and their live chat bot thing is useless.
Any ideas?

yeah i don't really have anything to add to the discussion at this point. i received an email pointing me to a bunch of help pages but, as usual, they are useless.
if anything else interesting happens i'll update
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:34:43
i'll have a look
just in case i was misinterpreted, it's not that i want it to crash. i just want to see it dip and ride it out

100% of your wallet consists of BTC

The fucking hell is happening in this sub?

Sounds like you have a nice marriage.

i had a youtube channel recommended to me recently and have gone and lost the link. any idea what it might have been?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:11:46
where are these crazy made up numbers pulled from and what purpose do they possibly serve?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:23:08
This probably isn't technically about bitcoin but does anyone have any good advice for stopping my friend from going to bitconnect?

desperate attempt to freeroll

Amazing you can't even be bothered to put enough effort into forming full sentences.
There's a dip at 6pm GMT tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:11:46
i want to watch a huge dip

Do you know what insider trading is?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:09:16
i believe you need to set up a connection between coinbase and your bank and to do that you'll need your swift code and IBAN. swift code is, broadly speaking, an international sort code (kind of) and IBAN is your international bank account number.
you can usually find them both on online banking

this does come across as sort of aggressive

Unfortunately we don't live in the same city at the moment otherwise I would drag him to the pub.

he didn't get 500, he's selling when the coin is worth 500

for someone who is just peripherally interested, could you explain what is happening on monday?

@_date: 2017-11-18 11:19:57

gratz though. great stuff

I opened a help request and then today got an email saying my id had been verified. Weird cos I didn't email my ID. I guess it stays on their file even if it rejects or something

if you got a refund in USD would you expect it to be adjusted based on changing value?

i'm very new to this and have been reading this subreddit a lot over the last few days. it reminds me A LOT of the 2005 online poker boom. a lot of ego, a lot of bravado and a fair number of memes and injokes.

is coinbases's ID verification temperamental? tried it with passport and driving license both through webcam and mobile and had no luck anywhere
