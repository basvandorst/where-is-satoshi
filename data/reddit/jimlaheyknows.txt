The longer answer: Move to another bank. Fuck BOA.

Rather pay the $9.99/mo and not care.

One word: Ossification
In the next 2-3 years, the Bitcoin network will become so large that gaining consensus on changes will become an impossible task.
The 21 million coin limit will never change. Guaranteed.

I've always been fascinated by the internet lawyers that decided that "SWIM" absolves you of self incrimination on internet message forums.
It does not.
You people are worse than jailhouse lawyers. At least jailhouse lawyers have some *actual* experience.
..and no, an FBAR is not required to be filed for Bitcoin holdings, in regards to the IRS.

My wife's warped sense of humor involves me coming home, her being drunk and wearing a strap on dildo.
Girl is nuts.

License...or registered?
Big difference.
A lot of people here seem to think if you're registered with FinCEN you're in the clear. You could be right...and you could be very wrong. It depends on the state you are in.
If you are operating in a state that requires a license for money transmission, you are in violation of FEDERAL law as well as state law if you're operating without said license. Regardless of whether or not you're registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN.
Violating a state money transmission law triggers a federal offense.
We're going to see a ton of Bitcoin trader indictments in the coming years. Wait and see.

I like how it says, "a single Bitcoin can be sold online or **on the street** for around $290."
Like it's a fucking bag of heroin.
These reporters are shameless.
