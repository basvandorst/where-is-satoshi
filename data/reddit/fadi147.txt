I have inputed my bitcoin address on blockchain.info and it shows my coins being transferred to another address. I was wondering if bitfinex moved any bitcoins to alternate addresses for safer keeping? I understand i won't know if my coins are safe until it all settles, but I was just wondering if this is a possibility.

Zane thank you for all you've done, I only ask you be a little more forthcoming with possible times of official communications. It's  stressing enough for all parties involved without having to refresh this page and btf's page every 2 minutes. Do you know if there will be an announcement tonight or can I get some sleep and wait till morning?

Hi zen, I'm on the same boat you are. Zane replied earlier that they didn't move any coins, and most likely we are one of the many wallets that were emptied.

Try not to listen to the crypto twitter crowd. Don't get me wrong they're are tons of great traders there but even when they're calling doom and shorting, most of them keep their profits in BTC. Whether they like it or not they are HODLING
