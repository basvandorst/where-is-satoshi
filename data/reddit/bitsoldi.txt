I agree with most of what you say. But you assume that I'm asking for something that I'm not. What I'm saying is we need to work on protocols in case the attack happens. Sort of like a fire drill or some sort of evacuation plan or some way to slow or diminish the attack when it occurs. I agree a 51% is hard to prevent entirely, but the better prepared we are, the less likely an attacker would be to launch the attack. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:47:59
You set back Bitcoin as a viable currency for ten years. At even 300 million dollars that would be something certain parties, even today, might consider money well spent.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:22:38
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:14:36
Huh? It wasn't designed to have a 51% attack vector. That's just an unfortunate result. So yes they (you and every one is) are ignoring it.
You (plural) are ignoring any attempt at figuring out a protocol in case it does happen. You are ignoring that the low value of an attack (less than 200 million dollars today) puts everything that you are building at risk. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:30:53
Few terrorists or bastards are concerned about "economic feasibility". If it cost 10 dollars to launch a nuclear attack, and anyone could do it, do you think folks would try? 
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:24:05
No amount of confirmations are safe from a 50% attack. Reason one: Because any attack would tank the price of bitcoin. Reason two: because the attacker could be working for more than a day, so 144 confirmations is nothing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:14:46
You're right. I can't imagine a single player on earth who would like to see Bitcoin disappear.  Sarcasm aside, humanity has more history of folks investing in destruction than creation. Or perhaps you think everyone is kind?
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:11:30
I guess 151 million strikes you as a lot of money. There are more than a dozen basketball players that could afford that attack and still be able to keep their house and cars. Lets not even start talking about bankers, consortiums and governments. 151 million is a joke. You know that. And I know that.

@_date: 2015-06-08 16:25:03
Aware of it it doesn't mean they are not ignoring it. In fact usually you have to be aware of something to ignore it. That's what is happening here.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:16:00
I'm not saying "solve" I'm saying build algorithmic or humanistic protocols to follow in case the attack happens. These would make it less likely to happen because it would mean that a simple attack alone might not be enough, there would be more hoops to jump. Capisce?
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:29:06
IMHO 51% attacks are a much bigger problem than 1MB blocks. And just because it says it in the white paper doesn't mean we have any solutions for it at all.

I'm gonna need some time to ponder this. James drops a dozen bombs here. "Proof of work is broken", "Centralization exists today", etc. I'm not seeing any surefire arguments to hit back with. And it kind of sucks. But thanks for putting together a great, thought provoking talk.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:08:54
sorry genius
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:46:27
This whole argument is a wee bit tangential, because the main point of the video is to beware of irrational (not for profit) actors making the attack. Rich terrorists and power hungry assholes do exist. There might be one at KNC today. Do you consider that dangerous? I do.
But, returning to the argument, while your discussion is well thought out, it has one fatal mistake, namely, you need to realize that a 51% attack can be done in a way so that the network doesn't notice. If the attacker includes all (or most of the) valid transactions and lets the network win a few blocks here and there, then we won't know there is an attack. In fact detecting a 51% with simple, code-based rules, is near impossible if the attacker has a noggin and wants to avoid detection. Agreed?
Still, I'll admit that to consider the advantages of earning money from a 51% is foolish and improbable and likely impossible. But that's not to say I disagree with the video. It suggests that some sort of POS protection will significantly increase the difficulty of such an attack. That's just true. Too many bitcoin disciples believe that POW is strong just because Satoshi wrote it. Its just not. POS in terms of 'price of attack' is ten times more secure, perhaps more.

yawn. man your polluting this subreddit with your cliches. go play internet poker or something and let other people speak.

revolutionists become the dictators we hate.
bitcoiners become the boring bankers we hate.

[fifty toras looks way better than millbits \(see image\)](
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:10:36
But still a million times better than dorky micro and milli...I upvoted you because now you're using your senses.
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:39:30
lets get rid of the m's and the millis and the micros altogether. we sound like Bill Gates at his most boring. Lets be better than that...can't we summon Steve Jobs instead, someone who knew how to make people smile not cringe.

thanks!! most people don't care about the benefits of bitcoin, they want their life to be beautiful. aesthetics is very important for anything to be well received.

A brand new naming system might solve a problem bitcoin has. The whole system is called bitcoin, and the standard unit inside the bitcoin system (now an inconvenient unit) is also called bitcoin. It is kind of like having the name "US Economy" be the name for the US economy and for the dollar. If we just use names that have nothing to do with the system we can avoid lots of FUD, confusion and what not.

nice observation...and yes just didnt want to get everyone all excited...left it off to keep everyone from wasting time trying.

Thanks. And while they look done, I thought posting on reddit is simply a humble proposal to the general community. And while the feedback has been great, there have been the usual slings and arrows. Clearly this is a beta. The drawings aren't done, final, submitted or non-changeable – they are just a colorful alternative to the metric system people seem to love, just a way to change the conversation. 
Technically, its actually a artifice on my part to escape the problem we all have with naming the central unit bitcoin. This is really inconvenient as the price has now risen so much. Like most on this subreddit, i'm not enthralled with the future of fractional numbers. So I came up with colorful and provocative images for the millis and micros. That's it. And I really see no problem with introducing five names. Companies introduce names everywhere. Ask yourself why Starbucks didn't fail with its bizarre naming system based on...well italian.

if you're parents are like mine, you tell them about bitcoin today and then you'll have to wait a good 30-40 years for the ok.
@_date: 2013-10-23 11:53:02
MAN!!!! I would have made hundreds. Wish they started this sooner...
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:14:13
then we agree, sorry for the understanding. For many, the look is completely irrelevant for cars, computers, houses etc. But some would say its quite the opposite.

What a great piece. Amazing stuff about colored coins and stock markets. (For those who can't access the article, definitely click through to the original article, but if you are having trouble, the website is having trouble...i've pasted the main text here...For the comments you'll have to click through).
======ORIGINAL TEXT=========
We owe many of the innovations that we use every day -- from our favorite longstanding websites to the latest mobile applications -- to the existence of underlying highly technical protocols.  Endusers don't need to understand these any more than drivers need to understand the workings of a car engine. Policy makers, however, need to understand the importance of protocols for enabling distributed permission-less innovation -- that is, innovation by many individuals and startups. For instance, the hypertext transport protocol (http) is what lets a browser talk to a web server -- as long as the server implements the protocol it can deliver innovative content or services to any browser. HTTP itself builds on many other lower level protocols, such as DNS and TCP/IP. Historically, protocols have emerged from either research projects or from individuals / small groups simply throwing something out that sticks. In the debate about bitcoin it is critical to understand that bitcoin has the potential to be such a protocol that enables a lot of new innovation to take place.
At the heart of bitcoin is a fundamental innovation: a distributed public ledger. A ledger in accounting is a book that you cannot edit once you have written in it. Instead, if you have made a mistake, the only way to fix it is to add another transaction to the ledger that undoes the error. As we know from accounting fraud, problems arise when people figure out ways to transact without recording it in the ledger or making ex post changes to the ledger (this is why Quickbooks isn't really an accounting system). The bitcoin ledger is the so-called blockchain which uses the fact that there are many copies of it that are broadly distributed combined with a fair bit of math to ensure that once a transaction has been recorded in the blockchain that transaction can not be changed after the fact. There is no other widely used protocol in the world today that accomplishes this: with bitcoin anyone can make a statement (a transaction) and have this be recorded in a globally visible and fixed ledger.
Why is this a big deal? Because as it turns out the transactions that can be recorded in the bitcoin ledger have a lot of expressive power built into them in the form of a scripting language. This allows for certain types of contracts to be built on top of bitcoin, such as deposits, escrows, all the way to distributed stock trading. For instance, there is a proposal for something called "colored coins" which allows additional data to be attached to a bitcoin that can then stay connected through all subsequent transactions. That data could represent, for example, shares in a company at which point the block chain becomes a fully distributed and public ledger of stock ownership (potentially replacing either physical certificates as still used by most startups or separate custody services). Because of the scripting language, the ledger is actually intelligent and once shares are represented that way it becomes possible to construct automated versions of derivatives contracts. 
These are just some examples of the innovations in financial services that bitcoin as a protocol can enable. Beyond that there is the potential to use the bitcoin protocol to solve other problems in a globally distributed fashion, such as how to assign and manage unique names (see also the Namecoin project). As various agencies consider regulations for bitcoin it will be important to balance the protection of consumers and enforcement against (organized) crime with maintaining the potential of the bitcoin protocol to be a fundamental enabler of innovation.

sorry i was just goofing around with the word micro. 
hopefully and most likely, micro transactions will fall inside of bigger systems (i.e. coinbase, blockchain wallet, etc) and won't appear as actual transactions on the block chain...it will certainly make the system smoother.
but yes...if you sent a Tora transaction, today, that would likely have a fee associated.

What retarded noob is gonna see mbtc and not understand it means milli? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:26:57
picture is still worth a thousand words.
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:09:42
 Good point.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:39:32
Satoshi would still be used. It is 0.000000001 BTC and it is referred to as the base unit in the graphic images you see here.
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:35:00
I actually think this could be beautiful. I'm upvoting, because anything is better than millibit. What are we trying to do chase everyone away who doesn't love math?
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:26:44
logic = unimaginative, boring. doesn't bitcoin have enough logic on the back-end that we can make a welcoming front-end?
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:54:46
wbn covered this beautifully in a [great 1 minute video for small businesses](

Let the philistines downvote. But damn...there's a lot of ugliness in the bitcoin world.
