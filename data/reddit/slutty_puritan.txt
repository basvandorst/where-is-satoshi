This is good advice.  If someone offers to help, make sure to find out who they are, and be careful to verify everything.  I wouldn't let them touch anything without being careful.
This is all assuming the wallet is not encrypted.  If that's the case, everyone's SOL.

Just look at the bright side.  You're getting in so early in your life, with the crypto market still in relative infancy, there will be a big reward for you down the road.  Don't fret over a few extra hoops you have to jump through to get your head start.

Would Bitcoin see a spike in the BTC/fiat rates, or only in the BTC/altcoin rates?  I assumed the latter, since altcoins tend to be a compartmentalized economy within the overall BTC economy.  I know Ethereum is sort of an exception, but is it?
Come to think of it, the earlier altcoin selloff preceded today's BTC correction most likely because some whales sold off their altcoin holdings in order to prepare for a BTC exit which commenced this afternoon.  Good to recognize for next time.

And by the time you figure out how to explain how you can run a program on a currency, Bitcoin will have resolved it's fee and speed problems.

US citizen here, but I'm trying to find the answer to the same question.
Here is a thread I posted earlier in :
I haven't found a real answer in that thread, though.
Here is a thread from years ago that I just found:

Where can one purchase options?

This ETH run is going to run out of gas soon, and some of that money is going to slosh back over to BTC and stay in the crypto economy.  I'm going to wait until ETH corrects and I'm going to use new funds, not BTC.

The cynic in me would make the same comment.  But at this stage in the exchange, it's just as likely I'd get stiffed out of a fee after giving some free advice.  Since I own an IT company that's been around for 25 years, it's a bit safer working with this stranger than some other schmoe.  I've actually helped someone else do this in the past.

Good buy, is more like it.

Here was my line of thinking:
If you're at a carnival and buy 20 food tickets for $1 apiece, you've spent $20.  What you do with those food tickets is sort of off the grid.  Ultimately, there is a day of reckoning when the value of those tickets is redeemed by vendors, but my thinking is all the altcoin markets are sort of like those vendors.  The transaction has already had its impact on the "real" $ economy (in our case, the BTC/$).
If there were more secondary markets established trading altcoins directly for $, these inefficiencies wouldn't exist so much, but since there aren't (yet), I think this is still the way it plays out.
