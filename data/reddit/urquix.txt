Is there a way or program that by introducing an adress it can check previous transactions, and like group the ones that came from the same adress, so for example if i sent fractions of bitcoins to diferent wallets and then from those wallet send it to a signle wallet. So with the program you can see like A and B may be the same person and so.
Sorry for my english, is not my first languague :D
