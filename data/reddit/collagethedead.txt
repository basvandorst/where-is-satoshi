Unlike a lottery ticket, it isn't a zero-sum game. Your odds aren't one in a million that it goes up, because bitcoin goes up more than it goes down, and it isn't exclusionary if one person sees growth. To run with the analogy it is like a lotto ticket you can win in various graduations and keep rolling the lottery until you are pleased with the results.

By optimal times, I mean when the value is relatively low or falling. (In the red.) Even if you're just using the monthly average, you will pull ahead over time.
For example, we have been in the $6,000 range recently and it has been a good time to convert to coin. It is a relative low, and dumping in your cash while low will improve your odds for value growth.

In at least the short term after buy-in, trends can be determined to mitigate risk. If you're paralyzed into inaction by greed (thinking "why cash in now, my $1 could become a million!!!" or something along those lines) you can't expect much, but this is true of all investments.
You can win several times a day if you're not too greedy with your threshold for "winning."
You can turn $1 into $1.20 over and over instead of HODLing out until you get $1,000,000. Just don't cash out at a loss over a pittance.

It is better to drop that into an account as fiat, then convert at optimal times. You could be deleting dollars and not even realizing it.

Well, the less you have, the better this value proposition is. A single dollar isn't worth as much as a single dollar exchanged for bitcoin, because you don't have much to lose and the potential to gain is higher than the potential to lose.

That's what the Bitcoin's for!

RIP using Bitcoin to buy your guns.

Why? Because people want to win fiat stacks.

Go big or go home, but don't do this until you see a great crash opportunity. I went all-in when we hit $6,000/BTC and so far just about anything that happened has been profit. The new low seems to be about $8,000/BTC. The smart thing to do is only buy at low extremes to maximize your profit and minimize the range where losses are possible. I have no debt, either, so I can HODL worry-free and without any pressure to cash out. It is up to me if I day trade with some of the BTC I invested in, to grow the total, instead of putting more USD in. Minimize risk. Maximize potential.

Look at all these weak hands.
