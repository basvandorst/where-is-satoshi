Many people have to buy bitcoin in order to spend it, or they buy it back after they have spent it. In addition, good news promotes buying pressure for investors and legitimizes bitcoin.

You haven't heard of tinypass? I understand with the tickets, but pass is really big. The other is in a very specific industry with pricing that is probably very expensive, possibly out of the general price range of most Bitcoiners. It's interesting to see tech like solar panels being sold for BTC.

There's some good stuff in here, interesting companies that I would not expect to be some of the first BTC adopters.

TBH that's mainly a suggestion for people to try using the pins in different way. I am getting a new batch of hi-res pics soon, so that should be fixed shortly. As for colors, we are currently working on designs for small orders, but for large orders we can do any kind of design on them.

I buy something for 100, so 100 BTC would be sold. But then, 100 BTC is bought back from me, or bought. Net of 0 BTC if markets are assumed to be 100% efficient. I am considering BTC just as liquid as money, so it really isn't exhausting consumer funds, it is just relocating them. However, buying pressure does arise once more and more vendors join and people view BTC as more valuable. So I would argue that ultimately I would increase the value.

Thanks, where from?
