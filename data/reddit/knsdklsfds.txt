Then as another commenter mentioned someone made a bitcoin address using a file hash as a private key is the likely scenario. Bitcoin private keys have their own format. Not normally printed as hexadecimal

Do you realise that bitgone before the hack mentioned their partnership with bitfinex  and their security many time on their homepage. It's gone now of course. So they knew that their biggest client had no security checks on their multisig wallet but still wanted to brag about their great security on bitfinex wallets.

It's important you didn't know this and who else would be the founders of a small startup except the dozen or so members. But near complete ignorance is the hallmark of a conspiracy theorists and without it you wouldn't have anything ;-). So keep it up

Because many libertarians don't know how to make honest arguments for their case so they turn to conspiracy theories about western governments and science.

You also need encryption for authentication. You could attack the system by sending your own bitcoin address over top of the correct address.

There are a lot of libertarians and conspiracy theories into bitcoin. So anything anti bank or government will get upvoted whether it's correct or not.

I would think you are being sarcastic linking to rt.com but then I know there are libertarian cults that love Putin.
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:40:12
Haha you should go to a bitcoin meet up and try to have an economics discussion with these libertarians. You will be shocked about how  naive and at the same time over opinionated they are about science and economics.
@_date: 2014-10-02 06:45:05
Don't get your economics (or science) from politics. You will have poor political ideas and a poor understanding of economics. Study the fundamentals then decide on your politics not the reverse.

Well that's a complete strewman. "authority and popularity" isn't the same as a consensus of experts. Most doctors will tell you smoking is linked to lung cancer. No know can "prove" that it is. But there is endless strong evidence pointing to a link. So we will never mathematically prove a link between smoking and cancer but if I had to bet $1000 I'd put it on smoking causing cancer because of the overwhelming evidence.

Two most brilliant economists because you agree with the political implications of their ideas or are theses the two most cited and well published researchers in the field? Trick question. I already know the answer.

Add the blockchain.info API to that list. No testnet either
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:35:23


The point about no testnet still stands. The blockchain.info API is one of the few not to have testnet.

First it's a soft fork. It's in the name! UASF
"Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."
It would seem links to the UASF github repos would violate this rule.

"Wright may be no Dr at all. His now-wiped LinkedIn page (you can still read the extensive profile here) suggested he had a PhD in computer science with Sydney’s Charles Sturt University (CSU). But a statement sent to FORBES today from the university said it had never handed Wright any PhD. “Mr Wright has not been awarded a PhD from CSU,” the statement read.
