Agora Commodities is great, done business with them several times. I first checked out precious metals to understand what bitcoin was designed in the image of and understand the competition. Bitcoin is cool, but precious metals like silver and gold are just as awesome, even better in some ways. 
The transactions are completely off the chain depending on who you transact with and you can melt it down in different forms or ship it anywhere in the world without any paper trail at all. Old rich man's money is far more untraceable than bitcoin could ever dream to be and yet bitcoin is the one getting the horrendous reputation and over-regulation.

I started checking out silver and gold since I enjoy bitcoin so much. I found out I like those too so now my interest is divided between bitcoin and PMs. Precious metals are actually way more anonymous and less regulated than bitcoin. Our government treats them like merchandise and you can send over a grand in the mail anywhere in the world with less than an ounce of gold. Not to mention you can melt it down or hammer it into another form.

Reddit is already doing something like this site wide with Reddit Bucks or whatever it's called.
Some guys already gave away hundreds of colored coins a while back in as an experiment. You could get with them to dispense the btc you want to give out and they could issue it to the coin holder accounts as a dividend.
It would be hard to just give it to because it would be limited to who signed up or saw it posted on that particular day.

**American boys do not accept cash month Bitcoin survive challenge**
*Abstract: American boy accept bitcoin survival challenge, going to the dentist, dating, enjoy musicals have to pay with Bitcoin*
Bitcoin rely on to survive what would happen? From across the Atlantic magazine writer Kevin Bitcoin Cruz gives the answer. Recently, Kevin completed a month-long experiment Bitcoin survival, this time, he had an unforgettable experience of going to the dentist, also dated beloved girl ...... Recently, Kevin received the "IT Times" reporter's interview.
**Love adventure, so the challenge.**
Late one night, Kevin received a strange phone number, the other from Bitcoin company Brawker, proposed a unexpected proposition: to live with the bitcoin month. The other said, in this month which will help Kevin to live as much as possible. "I love adventure!" Kevin said. Eventually, he gladly accepted the challenge.
Normally, Kevin lives in his aunt's apartment in New York, so he does not need to pay rent or electricity, do not need to buy gas. For Kevin, it is necessary to spend monthly mobile phone bills, food and so on.
These are very simple. By Brawker website, Kevin created an order, and within an hour after the release, received a phone operators can provide payment password; food is a large block overhead, Kevin bought a food gift card, buy a sufficient refrigerator filled with organic food, he even paid the bill on college loans through bitcoins.
**The Bitcoin "play bad."**
After the bills, food ...... when no longer have to "livelihoods" worry, Kevin found that he had a lot of BT currency balances, which since then that colorful life Bitcoin provide adequate funding for him.
**Dentist: Bitcoin can not pay painkillers**
One night, Kevin found a home in New York dentist accept Bitcoin payments. So he booked a basic teeth cleaning. "Your wisdom teeth need to be removed." Dentist said. Think of the bitter experience of my friends when wisdom teeth removed, Kevin rejected the dentist's kindness. After the adoption of the two-dimensional code scanning Bitcoin wallet, payment amount recognized finished, Kevin left.
However, a few days later, Kevin began to worry about wisdom teeth will affect the growth of the other, so he went to the dentist courage again, this time he decided to unplug the sinking wisdom. But then, he immediately regretted. No prescription painkillers (Bitcoin can not pay these drugs), Kevin tasted terrible pain. A few days later, the swelling of the cheeks to make him very uncomfortable, but unfortunately, the next Kevin can not eat the whole week he has reserves of any food in the refrigerator.
**Dating: others said do not believe to be true Bitcoin**
On his way to attend a gathering of Bitcoin, Kevin in the corner met a girl to his heart. As eager to participate in the meeting, Kevin and the girls did not talk much, he wants the girl's contact details. A few days later, Kevin had an Italian restaurant and a girl on the first date.
Candlelight, wine, food, they talk very happy.
Payment, Kevin took out his smartphone. Kevin sweep aside the girl saw the two-dimensional code after payment bitcoin situation, telling him, "I do not believe that Bitcoin is true, until there are a lot of people use ......"
**Look musicals: so incredibly surprised at the scene**
In Times Square, walking, Kevin saw a gleaming symbol: Broadway musicals. Perhaps everyone will suddenly flashed in the moment a strange idea, at that moment, Kevin thought: I must see this musical.
Luckily, Kevin successfully using bitcoins to buy tickets for this musical.Programs are very memorable, Kevin felt that a group of talented people can get together, really incredible.
Month, Kevin, there are many similar experiences. For example, he used the money to buy a bit of a MIDI keyboard to make music, attend yoga classes, such as airline booking.
**Enough, want to try again**
Bitcoin is amazing, Kevin told reporters that Bitcoin is an Internet-based currency. He believes that Bitcoin will likely change the world financial situation, "This is an unprecedented social phenomenon."
"Bitcoin has its own advantages, in case you can not produce any charges will be varying amounts of money into any one place in the world." Kevin told reporters, "but it can change the entire remittance industry."
At the end of 2014, a month-long experiment bitcoins over, "I feel like a pioneer, not just because I used to live a bitcoin, more importantly, I bought those can improve the health and well-being of my something that I can have my farm, my music can do ...... "Kevin said, plans to try this experiment.
**Dialogue Bitcoin boy**
**IT Times:** When Brawker company proposal to use Bitcoin life, why do you immediately said yes?
**Kevin:** Actually, I had seen Brawker Company. I think that the creation of Brawker Bitcoin's idea is very interesting, and I also know that life will depend on Bitcoin bit risky. But it is important, I like adventure.
**IT Times:** When using bitcoins to life, the greatest difficulty you encounter what is?
**Kevin:** When I walk in the streets of New York, if when I am hungry, you're in trouble. Bitcoin currency did not become mainstream, I'm unlikely to go to any restaurant or deli around me to buy food. At this point, I need to pick up my phone, find the nearest restaurants accept bitcoin. Then, flew past.
*IT Times:** Bitcoins can be used on which devices compared to Paypal or Appale pay, what do you think is more convenient??
**Kevin:** Bitcoin can be used on all networked devices including mobile phones and computers. In use, I personally feel that bitcoin is more convenient than Paypal, As Appale pay, I have not used, but I can imagine it is a very good mobile trading platform.
**IT Times:** The United States used the popularity of bitcoin to what extent?
**Kevin:** The United States has a lot of small deals to accept bitcoin, but has not yet become mainstream. United States to accept bitcoin large companies and websites have Dell, Bloomberg, Reddit, TigerDirect and so on.
**IT Times:** We know that Bitcoin has its own advantages and disadvantages do you think it does not it?
**Kevin:** I think Bitcoin is a very strong and powerful experiment, if successful, would be an important step in human progress; if not, there will also be a better version appears. Bitcoin disadvantage lies in its variability, you can expect a long time to maintain the value of the currency, but Bitcoin can not. In addition, the use Bitcoin relatively narrow range, a lot of dollars can be used in places not use bitcoins.
**IT Times:** Out of geeks, how to get people to accept bitcoin and use, or that do not belong to those who Bitcoin?
**Kevin:** I think let more people use Bitcoin, the key is to have an easier way to understand and easy to operate, and now a lot of developers do this. Bitcoin is an internet currency, and I believe it will become a future means of payment. Finally, my Twitter account is kcruz305, and I welcome the Chinese netizens to exchange bitcoins.

That's true, and that's actually what I recommend: Buy on Circle and transfer to Coinbase to take advantage of the USD wallet for bitcoin spending and tax purposes, if it is available to you. Not sure I would trust BTC-E with any amount of money, but that would work for wash sales as long as you rebuy the bitcoin as soon as you spend any of it. I'm just saying it defeats the purpose having coinbase if you have to buy on circle and hold USD on a russian mafia exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:44:37
Yea, it sucks waiting when you don't have to. I have one pending from making that same mistake myself. My standard response from now on to friends will be to buy and sell at Circle for instant BTC purchase and transfer to Coinbase if you wish to take advantage of their other services.
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:26:57
just the tip.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:53:07
All I want to know is: are BTC purchases still going to take a week now that they have all this VC, fdic insurance, and their own exchange? Because that's pretty shitty using my purchase as a put option for a week when I can have instant BTC at the other guys site. I just tried buying again at Coinbase to see if the experience was any better, and after 3 days into my purchase, I really wish I had access to it or gone with Circle. I asked the rep if The Coinbase Exchange would mean that there will be quicker service but he said he couldn't comment. We shall see, hopefully they get it together because I can't even use the USD wallet either as it's not offered in my state.

I don't know that anyone thinks the price will magically double on halving day. More likely what will happen is increased buying in anticipation of the halving and continued growth afterwards due to the supply/demand.

This is big news, why the downvotes?

You know for a fact they are using US dollars. Fuck they robbed a bank and took millions of them to finance their operations. Then some genius airdropped them a weapons cache. But sure, blame bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:19:38
You are right, I updated my post.

Coinbase Exchange is not yet available in your state. There is more liquidity waiting at the sidelines.

Makes sense, thanks!
edit: It works, just got the message from the bot. Thanks again, good luck and much success to you.

Yea, the founder sold it and is now heavily invested in crypto.

What would boardwalk be?

I don't think the wallet monitors transactions that aren't confirmed yet. Not sure but maybe because it would require more resources and data usage on your phone?

As long as you are happy, that's all that matters, precious.

Hi, John here from your bank. It seems like we made an error on our part. Everything should be cleared up now so go ahead and give it another try.
Just kidding, you should probably call your bank.

I'm not opposed to letting the rats drown in their sinking ship. Let them make rules to exclude themselves all they want. I won't do business with a New Yorker.

As the media reports, they have to educate themselves. Once they know what's up, they get it.

Depends, did you password protect it with BIP38? If so, maybe an eternity.
Also, I love how everyone just completely ignores the obvious troll.

We need better regulators, AML/KYC laws. And by better, I mean scrap them all. On a side note, I have never had an issue with Circle, but I signed up when they first opened.

That would be interesting if someone like him did that. Price would go pretty high, but my coins aren't for sale..

Sweet, it works.

I agree, I use it for escrow but not really to store my bitcoins long term.

I was telling my brother about stacking silver, he said "That's weird."
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:15:23
I don't know who he pissed off, but it ain't right. After seeing how valuable he is to the community and the discussions he brings to the table, I know whatever he did doesn't warrant a permaban.

True, but if you export a few of them and you have enough energy and local resources to make more then it doesn't seem too impossible. 
I'm still wondering how they know that there is no coal on mars? All you would need is organic material and some time. Scientists are pretty much convinced there was organic life on mars before earth, that's why they are looking so hard. Wouldn't it be buried like here on earth?

Looking forward to trying out multisig when I get my Mycelium Entropy. To me it seems there is a security feature lacking in most multisig where you can't create the separate keys on separate machines. If you have to create all the keys on 1 machine it creates a single point of failure and the person who created them has access to them all.

Anyone still have that source code? I wouldn't mind poking around.

Good afternoon, Gentlemen. Don't forget to pass it on and spread the love. Rewarding Youtube content creators for their work if you like what they put out is a good way to increase exposure and give back. Facebook giving for birthdays is also nice.

If the supply is cut in half and the demand stays the same or increases, price will reflect it by going up.

That's seems like the best bet if this is what they are dinging you for. It should probably be 2 separate apps anyways. You could always host the local trader on your site or another market.

Pretty cool, I like it. I hope this gets more attention.
Edit: Still waiting for it to message me. Will it let me pass the code you gave me on to some lucky gamer using the same method or will it ask me to purchase a new one?

If that were true there would be time travel to the past. If they had this technology in the future, then we would have it now now because someone would send messages on how to complete it.

Are you laughing because you think there is coal on mars or because you think by that time something like solar will be a cheaper alternative? If it's the latter, you have a good point as mars has plenty of surface area available for solar panels.
