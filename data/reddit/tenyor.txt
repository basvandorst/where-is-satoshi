You're talking about this like this is all good. Austrian Economics doesn't even believe in math, its all logic. Should be Austrian philosophy or something. We all know how accurate that ancient Greek philosophy was. Pass.

I'm no expert or anything. But treating humans like rational beings who try to maximize utility seems at best inaccurate. There are so many motives other than money that go into human though processes. Real life problems tend to have complicated answers. I love games and I find Game Theory really interesting, but behavioral economics seems like a better path for prediction to me right now. (Sorry for the lack of sources I'm a bit lazy but you get the idea).
edit: Heres someone who kinda knows what their talking about

Game Theory doesn't reflect the actual outcomes in most cases.

This was actually a really good point. You can always pay for US taxes in dollars.

The price of gold is arbitrary, what happens when it fluctuates? Do you suddenly take away money from people? Gold Backing the dollar makes no sense in a modern economy it stunts growth.
