Sure do not disagree with the logic. My point was yesterday had some good opportunities for it. Its obviously closing up so someone took advantage of it.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:42:37
A little update the record volume for yesterday was already surpassed. Still a good time to get registered  and get your account verified before you miss an opportunity.

Cryptsy is incorporated in Belize. Project Investors Inc is located in the US. The address is exactly where the office is. Bottom floor on the left. Ring the Buzzer you will see a Cryptsy logo on the wall through the glass doors.

Sounds like a plan I look forward to hearing from him. As a note I highly recommend all traders thoroughly review the Terms of Service on any site they trade on.

We will get it fixed but you really should be using 2FA and you don't need CAPTCHA.

As far as why MN1 is different than lets say cex.io . MN1 pays out to the holder at that moment so if you say bought MN1 5 minutes before a payout you get that days hashing power.
It also allows you to hold your BTC and earn while waiting to invest in other altcoins in a so far pretty stable market. And you BTC is relatively available instantly to trade into other alt coins rather than waiting 60 minutes.
All investments are a risk but I think you will find that guys playing the spread on MN1 are very happy. As well as most holders so far.

It is called social media marketing, and it is very effective thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:17:08
This is a SCAM we have frozen the accounts in question but unfortunately the money he received was gone already. We are still investigating and working hard to put the word out that we do not socialite money from individuals.

Another guy in the thread pointed it out down below. You could also compare the charts in the past 48 hours.
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:02:55
Yes the erroneous data likely caused your trading software ,which is 3rd party, to have unwanted orders. Your software could be programmed to skip the bad data, and still place the orders correctly. I highly recommend building checks into your software for any exchange to validate the data.
So you are aware I haven't reviewed your situation myself please email me at bitjohn and I will review your case.
On another note we have an entirely rewritten API being released shortly which should help most of our API traders write more powerful, accurate tools.

Cryptsy has been doing business in this space for some time not exactly sure why you would have trust issues. If you deposit coin you can get them out. While they are on the exchange you can trade them... Not sure what there is not to trust.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:35:06
Mostly promoting our growing USD markets and options. Arbitrage is a great way to do that since there were some great opportunities.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:34:06
The office is right here  swing by ring the bell.
If you Google anything and include scam you will also get results. Since you chose that as a keyword.
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:46:23
Bitcoin obviously hence my comment on great arb opportunities.
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:05:39
If you ever have seen crazy balances that is on the user end this happens when a full audit is running. They normalize once the backend audit is complete. Which happens when we want to ensure what your saying is happening does not happen.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:35:12
Just to compare some of the competition want to charge you between $1.50 - $100 on both sides.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:28:03
First of all great discussion. As far as the MN1 "Mining shares contracts go. I can assure you that the hashes are very real and provided by a very reputable third party.
Cryptsy.com is based and located out of Florida in the USA we fall under the same laws as as any other company based in the USA. Currently MN1 generates about 160 BTC a day in volume on an exchange that does between 2000-4000 BTC a day in volume. So overall its a very small portion of our revenue. Why would we risk criminal charges when we have a legitimate company that is profitable.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:14:19


There is no user who has not ever gotten their withdraws. Cryptsy is a US based company. We are licensed and legal. You can drive in to the office and say hello. Bottom line is your pointing out  random FUD thread. Cryptsy has been in business for about a year and a half now with over a quarter of a million users.
Ill also point out in the thread you reference the negative trust of the user posting and the number of customers pointing out that he is full of it.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:41:46
Well the cause is likely the lower volume and the fact that were not listed on many BTC/USD charts yet. You can see that same spread from other exchanges to BTC-e. They are independent markets after all.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:00:36
Swing by ring the bell. Guess you can only find out I am sure they will buy you lunch.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:21:06
Insightful and enlightening... Cryptsy is an innovator in the space and will be around for many years to come. So I guess I will have to stick around a while.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:26:44
Where do you come up with this realsolid relation? Ask any user from MCXnow the two exchanges are not at all close. Bigvern and I were both permabanned.
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:56:40
According to your article it was inside sources and sealed subpoenas? Not a public release like your stating now. It also makes up lots of stories about insider information. If you have proof post it... you don't of course because its a made up libelous story...
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:24:03
Since I have you all here I suppose its a bad time to tell everyone about our coming prepaid Mastercard withdraw option? I do like free advertising.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:31:23
exactly the author and his access to "sealed files" is obviously made up.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:14:40
The purpose of the cold storage is to keep your account secure. The fact its done is clearly stated in the ToS. To prevent this you simply login to your account once every 6 months. If and when a user returns the money will be transferred back to the account.
Now let us compare this to a bank. After inactivity you will be charged a fee... After a certain time the money is sent to the state government treasury...
We have taken a few steps to make this an easier and more transparent process. Which should prevent such a complaint in the future.
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:55:39
There is no SEC investigation. Its a made up news blog story. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:33:48
Sitting idle like we promised.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:25:05
So i will begin by saying the story is complete libel.
Bigvern has given the official response here 
And this is my own response and opinion if you want it:
The article starts off by declaring their are documents tying Cryptsy to the GAW scam. As I have publicly stated before no such documents exist. As we have ZERO association with them. After the GAW shenanigans we were offered a prime node which we accepted and never used at the publics behest.
As far as the document Cache that they don't release because they don't have it.... We speak to several of those agencies regularly. As we have a fully compliant OFAC reporting system if anything DHS is pleased. Our last contact with Fincen asked us to send less reports not more as we were submitting to many.
As I work in the company I know for a fact there are no company bots nor advantages for an employee to allow for the market manipulation accusation.
Lets just get one thing straight coinfire is a blog with ZERO journalistic integrity setup to sell advertising. The author only writes stories negative to troll Cryptsy. Did you catch any quotes from Cryptsy in there? Does the author work for homeland security? With all these vast resources and contacts wouldn't he be writing for coin desk or heck the NY times? 
The story is libel and we will take appropriate action against them if its not removed with a formal apology.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:23:06
They were our first real competitor and it was quite a rivalry. Many of their users moved to Cryptsy when he bailed.
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:03:02
Go look at their page they are always making up some "news blog"
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:28:34
apparently people don't put the positive news about Cryptsy on the internet....
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:49:38
Have no activity on your bank account for 6 months see what they start doing.... Not only that this ensures no one can get your coins while you go into hibernation. Its proven a very good tool in preventing lost coins.
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:13:29
Your reputable news page email is not functional 
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:29:32
It was thrown out.... because it was not legit.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:55:52
Um the winner of that contest was paid. Do you want your name announced as a winner?
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:06:54
Figure of speech lets go with 99.999%
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:56:34
What you are failing to recognize is Garza didn't give Cryptsy a prime controller. We didn't do anything that the paycoin haters folks accuse us of... And the SEC is welcome to investigate. Who know if they already were I couldn't tell you.... Maybe we contacted them.... My point is this is just old arguments.
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:33:04
Because the coinfire "blog" was also libel written by anon "reporters" noting "documents" that don't exist.
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:50:41
You notice any legitimate answers or responses just get down voted in any of these Cryptsy complaint threads? Same group of people spreading the same FUD.
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:10:37
Oddly coinfire.io is no longer a company....
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:18:06
It is not the exchanges making the laws.... So when they change the rules we cannot break them. Call a congressman?
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:15:55
The majority of folks you hear complaining about withdraw issues etc are the same people complaining at coinbase. They are being flagged for various AML/KYC issues and refuse to address them. If you don't verify yourself after you are flagged for something AML related its not legal to send you the money... If your not a crook then chances are you'll never have an issue like 99% of our 330,000 users.
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:26:17
They and the scrutiny change daily actually.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:55:36
We are taking it all into account, but the first step is making the process more automated. We have had this policy for some time this is the first instance where a user actually reported an issue with it. 
I understand skepticism in this space. I also think it what makes the community strong and healthy. My promise is to make the process easier, and more transparent using all the feedback folks have suggested here. Hope that helps alleviate any concerns over the policy.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:26:00
Id agree if they were a credible new source. Bottom line is the story is fake and intentionally out to harm our company. So we will take action.
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:50:06
I'm going to get you full orderbooks :)
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:47:50
Oh so if you google frozen funds on coinbase there is no one with that issue? Oh wait there out there same scenarios. Because the restricted lists get updated regularly. So a person could be ok one day, and not the next.
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:57:21
Weird it also coincides with us wanting to find a mining partner.... Instead we went with DigtalBTC hence no stock swap. Those emails also coincide with the Las Vegas Inside Bitcoin where all this was discussed.
Did we list paycoin like we list 250+ other altcoins yes. Were we the only ones? No
You realize we are like the only exchange not to get into ICO's and other shady shit right?
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:24:39
Well said.
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:06:15
The things we cannot elaborate on are anything related to a customer and an ongoing investigation. AML laws do not allow us to tell a customer they are being investigated.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:27:13
Because Garza is a crook and if it were legal for me to comment on what actions were taken in that regard I would. Action was taken we just cant disclose what action by law.
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:12:45
You mean the slander was removed like coinfires?
