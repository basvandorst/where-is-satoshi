Good for you man, but I value my own life and time more than slaving away for 16 hours a day. 
I'm not actually that desperate for money at all, I simply want a better job that pays more and to invest and earn to supplement that. 
My goal is less work, more money not more work. Thanks.

Is it even retiring at that point? Or just I have enough money to not waste time working
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:15:40
Yeah if it's public knowledge it's like painting a big old money sign on your ass. 
But if nobody knows you can easily store millions without worry

Like a dragon baby
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:20:26
This checks out.

I wish I could do this with my grandparents who just let hundreds of thousands sit in a bank for decades.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:37:35
Yeah that would mean the collapse of countries currencies worldwide

It'll be fucking 2018 at this rate.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:14:22
Id finally have somewhere to chuck this million sitting around
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:31:15
With that much money I could live off of investments the rest of my life. Why is it always wasted on someone who has no idea what to do with it
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:02:05
Money is so fucking stupid but I'm still constantly pissed off I don't have any.
