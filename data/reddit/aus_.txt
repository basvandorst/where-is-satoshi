I had my phone die on me so I lost my 2fa to bittrex so I just emailed them and they gave me a couple steps to take to remove it and then I just added 2fa using my new phone.
It wasn't a big deal.
as per their support:
Remove/Disable Two-Factor
In order to have two-factor removed you will need to enter a support ticket from your valid email address. We will not be able to help you remove the two-factor unless your ticket is submitted from your Bittrex account email.  Once we receive your email we will reply with further instructions for removal.

You do what you think is right for you.

Glad you got it figured out.

You buy it using the "Trade" page.
Is that what you are doing?
You should be able to put 1000 AUD above the review and confirm button.
that is if your cash account shows $1000
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:07:54
when you type 1000 where the 0 beside AUD does it show a value for BTC?
Like when I do it right this minute it shows for 1000 AUD I would get 0.2283 BTC
(excluding 1% fee)
Oh and you are doing it on the web (in a broswer) you should see a "Trade" link on the left.. that is how I buy my btc

I tried what you suggested and still no go.
Also, if you are taking suggestions, how about a "pin to top" option :)

The base currency changes aren't saving for me.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:31:35
Yeah you are one the wrong page.. you need to go to the :TRADE page
Ok so my guess is you are using the mobile version so I just reinstalled it on my phone and see there is no "trade" page so you are probably doing it right.
You should be able to put 1000 where the 0 AUD is and it will allow you to click confirm.
If it isn't it is glitching.. 
So maybe check if there is an update for the app or kill it and restart it and see if that helps. 
Other than that, no clue sorry.

Not eftpos but newsagencies where you can buy bitcoin.. there is a 2.5% fee and a $50 min.
You also need a [-&gt; Coinjar Account &lt;-](
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:11:50
She could get a [coinjar.com.au]( account (it will still take a couple days to get verified and link a bank account) but once you do you can buy bitcoin at a lot of news agencies.
Buying at a new agency comes with a 2.5% fee with a $50 minimum though.
You could send money to the account using bpay or poli also which take a day or 3 and has no fees and has a $10 min.

I would have deleted all the api keys and whitelisted withdrawal wallets and then reset the password. 
That should have put an end to the damage.

I've had the same problem for 12 hours and when I finally can place an order it goes from Pending to Canceled in about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:16:19
I had the same thing happen with my phone today.. after panicking for about 2 hours I took the battery out and put the charger in and waited about 5 mins and put the battery back in and it started to charge.

There are 2 addons that I use.
Crypto for google sheets &amp; Cryptofinance.
You should be able to find them in the addon search thingy.
