It has to do with the actual amount of data, not an arbitrary discount.

Asking this question shows you, like most people, do not actually understand money.
Money is just a social tool like writing or speech. We use it to express our ideas of value.
The value is not in the money. 
Basically when you hand someone a $20 bill at checkout you are speaking an abstracted language about the value you have contributed to someone else and a debt owed to you.
We forgot what money was over the last few thousand years.

If they don't send you any tax forms then the IRS has not been informed, **BUT** the IRS can always do a blanket data grab like they did to coinbase. 
Here is the response Gemini gave me last week.
Hi there,
Several customers (including yourself) have inquired about tax reporting, more specifically whether or not Gemini will provide Forms 1099-B relating to bitcoin or ether transactions on our platform. Our initial analysis is that Gemini is not required to issue Forms 1099-B because bitcoin and ether sales appear to be regarded as sales of personal property under current IRS guidance. Forms 1099-B are not required to be issued for sales of personal property, and therefore, while we are still evaluating this issue, we do not believe that Gemini has a filing requirement at this time.
With that said, our account reports do provide information related to 3 of the 4 pieces of information related to determining gain/loss of your bitcoin or ether activity on Gemini:
1) Date acquired (if your bitcoin or ether were purchased on Gemini)
2) Date sold
3) Proceeds
You can access your account report by following the two steps below:
1) Click the “View All Transaction History” button located at the bottom of the Dashboard
2) Click the “Download History (xlsx)” button. This will prompt the account report to download on to your device.
Please note that we do not have any way of knowing the cost basis for bitcoin or ether deposited into your account (one of the necessary pieces of information to complete a Form 1099-B). As a result, we recommend that for tax preparation, especially related to any sale of bitcoin or ether on Gemini that were acquired elsewhere, you consult with your personal tax advisor.
We hope this information is helpful.
Onward &amp; Upward,
Gemini Customer Support

With todays scientific knowledge  it's not feasible.
Distance would be a huge problem. Signal delay can be 5 to 20 minutes. Local mining wouldn't work because the lag would wipe out blocks from the planet with minority hash rate.

Since you set the rate you can see the total fees in sat before transfer. Not sure on ledger but any good wallet should at least let you preview that.
Size in bytes = total fee in satoshis / fee rate
I saw a formula once where you could calculate fee size if you know the number of inputs and outputs. Not sure.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:38:42
It's only going to get more expensive as regular traffic is reduced by segwit and lightning. We also have new companies getting into mining so Bitmain will be losing a lot of efficiency to recapture the fees they spam with.
Money spent spamming the network would be better spent competing with other miners.
I think this is the final spam battle. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:55:19
Important to know,  when you see a transaction with 0 confirmations that means that that transaction is in the mempool of the node you're using, but it isn't in a block yet so it has not been validated yet so it can't be trusted.
Transactions are shared by nodes through peer to peer connections and placed in thier own mempool. Miners also are connected to nodes an pull transactions out to validated and order into a block.
New blocks get passed to other nodes and each node independently checks that the block and its contents are valid before adding it to it's copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:45:49
You don't demand payment on lighting. You only send. There is no request.
If I'm wrong on that it's still easy to stop.
if this hasn't been prevented already it can simply be prevented by requiring that all messages be signed by the private key used to opened the payment channel.

Bitcoin has not been compromised on any technical level and many improvements are coming no mater what the price dose. Any price crash not tied to some technical reason will only be temporary. 
We could be going to 5K or even lower over the year. Bitcoin has had bear market years before.

The massive spike in price started just as the mempool got clogged up, which oddly was right after Roger Ver announce he would be on CNBC next Monday. Hmmmm?
Anyway this back log dried up liquidity which made prices rise. In addition traders could not move funds for arbitrage trading which is why exchanges were hundreds to thousands of dollars off.

The lack of technical knowledge is not the problem, its undoing the assumptions and habits created by the fiat system.

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:44:55
No. Because on chain the users have to compete to get into a limited block space. Demand puts upward pressure on fees as people in a hurry one-up each other.
In lightning there is no limited transaction throughput so lightning nodes have to compete to get transactions by lowering fees. This puts downward pressure on fees.

The inflation is getting out of hand. 27 blocks per hour. If this keeps up they will push bcash to the  halving by year end, and when that happens it's dead. There are no fees worth mining.

Do you want to be sitting on the outside, still trying to time the market when it's 10k per coin?
And what if it falls to 3k and you buy just for it dive to 2k? You will freak out and sell. But guess what! Just after you sell the price goes up, but you don't buy back in because the "analysts" are yelling about bull traps.
You find yourself with less money and no bitcoin. 
Learn about bitcoin an decided if you believe in it. If it works then 1 bitcoin will be worth a fortune, if it does get adopted it will be worthless. No middle ground.

100 sat/bite fee transactions in the mem pool have not been touched for a while. You could bump the fee. If your wallet doesn't do that you can import the private key to one that does like Mycelium.

Most of the 0-5 sat fees popped up when the exchanges opened BCH deposits.
My best gues is these are transactions to split cold storage walets before sending BCH off to exchanges. Since there is no need to touch that for months just send it off as cheap as possible.

It doesn't work like that. Think of sled dog racing. The sled is the company and the dog is a mining computer. All the dogs do not pull one sled. There are multiple sleds being pulled by teams of dogs competing in a race. 
If half the teams quit it doesn't  change how fast the others finish.
Also if the most powerful miners leave it then becomes more profitable to invest in more mining equipment equipment because you will get twice the ROI. Both chains will grow in hash rate.

I think both chains most likely will drag each other down and people will loose trust and interest in bitcoin and mass adoption will never happen.

worse case, some miners will slowly drop out. the average block time in 2016 blocks is 10+ minutes, difficulty drops and the remaining miners become profitable again.
However cheaper fees mean people will make more transactions so that could bring us to at least brake even. You also have to remember mining CPU advancements will continue, giving more hash rate for less power cost.

And where did that bitcoin you bought come from? Did you just throw money into the air and have it magically appear?!
NO! It was mined legitimately on the bitcoin chain before being sold to you and is still one, and only one, of 21 million that ever will be!

No it isn't because you can't spend a forked coin in the legacy network. 
When dollars get printed you can spend them anywhere that took USD. The Bitcoin network will never accept coins from an invalid block.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:01:04
That ROI is going to be a fast moving target as difficulty rises and in the end you will have less bitcoin then if you purchased it.
However there is the bonus that the coins you mine will be anonymous so long as you quarantine them mining wallet from anything that can ID you.

I know that feeling. When I was in a programming class in 2011 my professor was showing us how bitcoin worked. Wasn't really the lesson just one of his many tangents. I wish I had taken more interest then. I wonder if he had any Bitcoin then?

Effectively 4mb. But that is only a temporary help from a side effect. Any block size boost will make fees lower at first but that will just lead to more people transacting and fill up any additional space bringing fees back up. 
This is the point big blockers miss. The laws of supply and demand will lead to hard fork after hard fork to keep increasing block size.
With little growth in adoption the blocks will be such that only $20k server can run a node. Even Craig Wright said this.
If bitcoin is run by a handful of servers then attacks from hackers and governments will be cheap and easy.
This is why we need lightning which can scale to infinity, and lightning requires SegWit.

The miners are not in a position of power over users. That is an illusion. 
The users set the price of any crazy fork miners come up with.
If the users don't like one side of the fork they won't buy it or massively devalue it.
Mining cost money. You have payroll, utilities,  and leases/rent to pay. If users devalue a fork to 10% of the original it will not be mined.
When you dump one chain an hold another you are casting a vote on the supreme law of supply and demand, which all must comply with or pay dearly.

@_date: 2017-10-21 00:22:32
remember that transaction fees are calculated by the size of the data in sat/bite (Satoshis per bite) rather than a % of the amount sent and this is how most wallets denominate fees. Because the block size is limited miners only care how big the transaction data is, not the monetary amount.
Use this link for picking your fee
On this site you can see the pending transactions. Each dip means those transaction got mined into a block. See how the lower fees pile up for a while before a block takes them. At the time of this posting most fees over 80 sat/B are confirmed in 1 to 3 blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:38:07
Selling both doesn't double your return because b2x is trading at 10-15% of Bitcoin in the futures markets, which give a good estimate on where the price will be at the fork, then it's down hill from there.

I believe in the coming years at least in the US you will be required to have an ID verified bitcoin account with a bank controlling the private key and reporting all activity to state and federal authorities. 
You may not be able to ban bitcoin but you can slap regulations on any business that wants to accept it as payment, and they will comply. Any attempt to spend will be checked agents the approved address list.
Any transaction between your registered account and an unregistered account will be reported.

This makes me think... Bitcoin will not be able to fully function that far from earth unless we figure out quantum communication. You could spend and receive funds at a slow pace but you could not mine or make use of a full node.
Mining word be the biggest problem.
Any attempt to mine would be on a copy of the block chain that is 3 to 24 minutes old due to the distance from the main network on earth, so any block it they find will be rejected. If mars was to get a supper majority hash power it could irrevocably fork from the earth chain and never reorg. Need to think about this more. Hmmm

I think you get a small bump in demand for BTC as people will be looking to dump BCC to get more Bitcoin with it, but maybe only a 0.5% bump. BCC in turn will crash hard but could still stay alive after. if it makes it through one month it could survive long-term and be worth a few dollars but never touch LightCoin.

Buy local face to face or ATM.
If you want to play tha market you can use Poloniex at your own risk. The level 1 account has a $2k per day withdrawal limit(crypto only) and only needs Email.
 However it's risky because if they freeze your account randomly you will have to verify your ID and you are screwed. 
You could also use the bitshares decentralized exchange but the volume is very limit. It could be more viable in the future

I wish I wasn't such a good hearted person. It must be so easy to make a living on crypto scams 
*sigh*

Crypto is garbage. There is a man in Australia who will spend the rest of his life digging through a land fill for a hard drive full of bitcoin.

Why would you use mixers or tumblers when you can brake any spend trail by shapeshift to Zcash or Monero?
4 accounts, BTC1 is the only accounts that can be linked to the user's ID
BTC1 shapeshifts to Zcash1, then Zcash1 to Zcash2 and shapeshift into account BTC2
BTC2 never touches anything that could be linked to a user like IP address, shipping addresses, verified exchange accounts. 
Now I plan to pay all my taxes but with rules like SB 1241 possible and the IRS abilities to retroactively criminalize you I intended to be as anonymous as possible so they have only my word to go on.
