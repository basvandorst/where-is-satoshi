I personally am a closet fan of reading comments that came straight out of people's asses as well.

The difference is that, after crashes, stock markets rally. The world's stock markets, up until last month, experienced the longest and largest bull run in history, lasting 46 months and adding $45.6 trillion worth of value. Mutual funds regained their value plus and additional 20% worth of gains. 
I guess that's the difference between "the responsible thing" and investing the majority of your liquid financial assets into bitcoin.

TIL MIT's professor of engineering is a "dumb" person.

If you have paid any attention to China's stock markets in the past several days, you'd be aware that you are talking out of your ass and probably should reserve commenting on something you clearly know nothing about. Your whole comment probably should have been kept in your head.

I apologize. I meant to emphasize on the finance industry sharing bit.

I feel as if banks are just going to create their own internal ledgers or maybe an industry wide one that is bank only instead of "sharing" with the blockchain.

/:/bitbombs doesn't seem to be aware of the fact that banks have access to trillions of dollars worth of capital, which is more than enough to build a ledger for the finance world. It really wouldn't cost much of anything to develop. And even if it costs, say, a billion dollars to develop, banks would still have enough money as a collective industry to pay for those costs.

Loans for what?

Except, if you've read news regarding blockchain developments in the finance industry outside of Hitchin specific sources, you'd know that banks aren't looking to work or even associated themselves with the bitcoin "coattail" (whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean). 
Nathaniel Popper, bicycling enthusiasts and writer for the New York Times pointed this out clearly in his latest Blackhawk article.
