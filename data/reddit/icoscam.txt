Roger Ver is truly trying to destroy Bitcoin. He's participant in altcoin pump and dump schemes.
Here's link to post where he brags (pumping) to his followers about his Dash holdings:
@_date: 2016-11-21 09:55:31
I'm glad that he left bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:11:52
This would be good time to abandon coinbase completely. Just pull your funds out of coinbase and let that centralized service fade away.

Mining pools are.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:03:29
I don't get it... there's no fighting. There's minor group of altcoiners pushing their agenda and attacking against bitcoin. If they want they can create their own alt out of BU.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:41:51
Large mining pools are financial institutions of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:39:33
How about working or buying?
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:26:53
That's right. At the moment size of the blockchain is so large that I'm not running bitcoin node on my laptop computer anymore. Today you almost need machine that is dedicated for running it. We really don't want unlimited/bloated size for blocks, because it's what destroys most important aspect of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:58:08
Without SegWit there's no future for bitcoin. It's not about that technology that much, but it shows that community can't come up with solutions and that rolls us several years back.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:10:13
Yeah, but that shit require segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:17:34
How about working or buying?
@_date: 2016-11-23 07:37:17
HearnCoin fails
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:23:16
lol troll
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:03:39
But miners and nodes are equally important actors of bitcoin network. If people don't have monetary incentive to run nodes then nodes will centralize and total node count decrease.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:23:34
It's not attack. If SegWit will have more than 51% support, we should activate it to flush out bad actors.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:10:28
And without nodes bitcoin network just don't work... Someone needs to run nodes, obviously. But why should I do it when I don't have monetary incentive?
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:29:53
prof. bitcorn was just a clown and is fiat bagholder who is profoundly butthurt because he missed bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:08:08
Altcoins? I thought that they were long forgotten fad of 2013/2014, with recent ICO scams like ethereum.
Nowadays it's just private blockchain scam that will be crushed soon that has taken space from altcoin scams.
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:16:41
has already their alt/shitcoin. It's Bitcoin Unlimited and it's good role model for showing how to not do things.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:07:12
This is most probably Roger Ver, because he wants to create distraction and divide bitcoin users.
He like to play his sociopath games:
@_date: 2016-11-07 08:44:18
Solidity is utter garbage and it will sink RSK as well.
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:58:32
If SegWit fails there will be one huge dump and bitcoin probably struggles to recover. We don't want see this. Solution is to lower activation threshold if more than 51% support shows up.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:18:59
Your predictions are always bullshit. Go and play with your shitcoins and stop spreading FUD.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:55:30
This is probably Roger Ver's fake chinese identity. I bet he enjoys releasing news like this.
@_date: 2016-11-28 09:19:23
And is active at sub. Makes you wonder, right?
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:37:41
Relax dude... Don't yell... take it easy.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:32:57
You know it when you reach it. Some of us are already at moon, some are on the rocket and some are waiting next rocket to arrive for pick up.
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:12:47
We don't buy, we HODL.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:50:40
LOL... snake oil blockchains
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:25:59
Banksters puppet.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:56:50
It does not matter because next dump is caused by SegWit failure.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:45:03
Originally mining happened with bitcoin client which was also a bitcoin node. Now miners and nodes are separate actors and you run bitcoin node without any monetary incentive to validate consensus rules for blocks that miners produce. Why miners are rewarded? Because they burn more energy than nodes? Is this only reason?
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:29:31
Yes, until SegWit activates.
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:35:58
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:43:30
It's just loose spelling.
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:50:49
It's scamcoin pool.
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:15:27
I bet that Roger keeps sending coins back and forth with his ViaBTC pals take make this cloud mining scam to look legit.
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:02:15
How long this guy keeps destroying bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-28 08:48:10
I'm ok with $10 satoshi.
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:40:52
U know.. Indian rupee, segwit and shit like that.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:00:06
Government shitcoin... 
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:28:34
I don't think that attacking is good solution in any case. BU is distraction driven by on purpose by nasty and uneducated people. 95% threshold for activation is probably too high, but we will learn good activation threshold from this episode. 
Threshold should be high enough, but not too high to enable hostile entities like ViaBTC, or to hinder Bitcoin on purpose.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:54:43
People are greedy. We can't do anything for our natural habits... I guess this is how it always ends.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:23:36
XT, Classic, Unlimited all coup attempts failed. At this attempt they throwed away Core code base to blur their incompetence and make it little bit more difficult to make direct comparison. Just look at sponsors... I bet that Ver is throwing his money on this shit as well.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:07:53
You have to know what you're doing with C. Programmers who are used to high level languages like Java usually don't understand how computers work. Why incompetent people who have no capacity to program should do it? We don't want incompetent people to design engines or bridges and we don't need low skilled people to write software. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:38:55
Well... SegWit won't lock in. It's blocked by altcoiners who're promoting BU and mining at ViaBTC. There's no way SegWit will get 95% vote.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:16:45
Who is this delusional dork?
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:21:50
If you buy $10 worth of bitcoin today what it will be in 2022? $0, $5, $10 or maybe $20.. even more than that?
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:46:54
This is better suited for or @_date: 2016-10-26 11:13:43
It looks like that altcoiners will be hashing BU with their 10% slice of total bitcoin hashing power to block SegWit activation. SegWit WILL NOT activate at 15.11 and it's effectively blocked by BU and ViaBTC.
We're in situation where bitcoin scaling is totally blocked and there's no way out.
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:33:36
Bitcoin community should start to boycott any business with coinbase immediately. Let them run their business with $ETB (Ethereum Bailout Edition) bailout scamcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:16:40
Bad luck Brian is butthurt?
