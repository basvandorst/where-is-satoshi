Hi, I run an openbazaar store that focuses on sourcing and exporting from China to other countries. This is my store ID a930c023c05be077f2bdb56b68f91ba68f4aa5df
PM me for more details.

Hi, 80 rmb (Chinese renminbi) not $80. It's about $12 per pack.

Chinanumba1 here: 
Thanks for doing the video! Glad you enjoyed it.
Just a couple of points about the products:
* the inflatable bag is really difficult to inflate indoors, same with the original product. Once you go outside in the slightest of breezes it is easy to inflate. There is a bit of technique involved.
* I am really excited about the phone charger: it is dual adapter iphone and samsung. The two different heads snap into each other.
* the paper in the plastic bag is "magic" calligraphy paper, you can write on it with plain water and it will appear as ink and disappear in a minute or two. Great educational toy for kids.
Shipping individual products from China can be costly, depending of the volume and value weight of the product. I have a range of shipping options available which is more suitable, depending on the speed of delivery. I also do LCL and container shipping.  If you buy in bulk you will get great value.  I use Fedex/TNT/DHL mostly for samples. I can use Chinapost e-packet for low weight items (it is a bit slower than Fedex.
Lastly, I am expanding my business and starting to do this full time in about 3 weeks' time.  You can expect to see a lot more in future.
If you want to chat, you can email me at chinanumba1 I will be happy to answer all your questions.

It's fine, I have sent it before. It's not illegal to send small amounts of cigarettes.

Hi, I think I can. I use EMS and can ship to most countries. We can try and if the package is not delivered to you, I will refund you. I do have a very high success rate. The money stays in escrow till you receive the goods.
Please note that 2 packets are the minimum order. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:36:06
I can make you a package with misc brands if you like. Maybe 3 different kinds, no problem.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:50:52
I am the cigarette vendor, I have many more brands to choose from now. 
I can ship to most countries. I ship from China, not NK. I get them from someone inside NK.
If you have any questions, you can pm me. I will respond within 12 hours.
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:38:38
I can do that too, it will just take a little longer. The whole process can drag out for a while because of negotiation and research. I would estimate about a month for complex products.  PM me if you need more info or if you want to share ideas.

Hi, the great thing about openbazaar is that you don't have to trust us, you can select your own moderator (mediator). If the product or quality is not to your liking, the transaction is cancelled and you get your money back. That being said, we aim to deliver a perfect service to you.
Usually we order a sample, then we discuss it with you and/or send the sample to you. If you decide to purchase the order, we list it on Openbazaar and you select the moderator.
Pm me and I can send you more details about shipping prices etc.

I have a lot of random stuff on there but mainly I focus on buying products off Taobao, Alibaba (the chinese version called 1688) and T-mall for customers. I can get anything you want. 
I live in China and I have a Chinese partner who has an established business for Chinese expats buying things off local stores.  Have a look at the store and chat with us. I can do bulk or small orders.

@_date: 2016-04-29 14:43:09
Firstly, the amount of sellers on alibaba is much, much smaller than 1688. Secondly, a fair amount of the sellers mark up their products quite a bit to the foreign market for various reasons. 1688 is a domestic market for Chinese businesses mostly. 
I often struggle to connect to 1688 if I use a vpn utilizing a location outside China. Lately I cannot connect at all, so I think it is blocked for users based outside the country.  Let me know if you can access 1688.com and search, I would like to know.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:40:25
interesting! I just assumed it doesn't work for others because I can't connect to it via VPN. Have a browse around and you can see the difference in prices to Alibaba for the same product sometimes. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:31:37

You are right that some companies will copy your product given half a chance... IP law is almost non-existent here. It has contributed to the rapid rise of the economy over the last two decades but it could also contribute to the decline of it, as products are now copied in countries with lower labor costs such as Vietnam, Cambodia and India.  It reminds me a little of some altcoins, if you don't offer something substantially different, be prepared for another altcoin to copy you and improve on your design slightly.
From our side, we will not resell your product and do our best to choose a reputable factory who will also not do it. However, we have no control over what the factory decides to do in the end.
I have some other thoughts about intellectual property protection in China, so feel free to PM me and we can chat about it.

It has an active community and smart developers. That's already more than 90% of other altcoins.
 Also, the most people who love Doge are the early bitcoin investor types. Big part of the strategy is to spread around tips, which is crucial and tactical as it gives new users some 'skin in the game'.
 I wouldn't underestimate doge, in 4 months r/doge will have more subscribers than r/bitcoin. If that will reflect in the price is anyone's guess.
Also as a community, their antics can be very attractive to the media as it is more playful.

Kyle, I warned you to pull the plug on this but you didn't listen. Do you know why I'm so persistent? because I have lost more than 30 bitcoins in 19 scams over the last 3 1/2 years.
Scams come in different shapes and sizes and I can spot them from a mile away.
I've spent time with Danny Brewster and the Neo&amp;Bee team in person and you know what? Everyone except Danny thought they were building a legitimate business. So I either feel very sorry for you, having to find out after a few months or even years that you have been part of this, or you are also in on it.
**What Mickey Mouse company doesn't have financial statements?** This should be a massive red flag for everyone. NO ONE should have any money in this place. If you have, you deserve to lose it.


 Are you fucking kidding me? We don't need companies like yours in bitcoin.
I know why Joseph is so eager to please all of a sudden: because he senses another bull run with large trade volumes and he wants to draw new blood again.

19 scams isn't a lot. I define scam broadly. 30btc also wasn't a lot when the bitcoin price was $2 to $40.  
Ask any investor/speculator in bitcoin related companies which had a public IPO and ask how much btc they made in the long run.  The successful bitcoin companies with legitimate business plans don't usually have public IPO's. They get support from venture capital companies.
The two who paid off for me were Satoshidice and ASICminer. That's all I needed to be in the green.  Even **their** price didn't make it in the long run and I count Voorhees and Friedcat as two pretty decent member of the community. 
If you weren't impulsive, you probably wouldn't be into bitcoin at this stage, scammers know this weakness in the community and prey on it. 
I guess the best way to learn is to lose your own bitcoin, so take some small amounts of bitcoin and play around. Having skin in the game is a great motivator to learn.

I visited Neo and Bee in Engomi for a few days in January. I was very impressed with their COO George Papagiourgio. I sincerely hope will take over the reigns. The CFO (another George) is an older CA with a no nonsense attitude. Although he was very direct and confrontative, I could sense he is no fool.
There is also another guy high up called Andreas (not Antonopoulous) and he was thoroughly decent.
I'll reserve my judgement on the CEO until I have a clearer idea of what exactly is going on.
There is enough talent in Neo to pull through but they will have to seriously reasess their game plan.

I think the situation is slightly more complex than it seems at first glance.
The recourse of the consumer would be in providing feedback to other potential buyers which would eliminate incentive of drug sellers to hunt short term profit and rather become better agriculturalists, business people. Long term profit what they will be after and competition will keep them on their toes. The reason why crime is drawn to drugs is because of the lack of any recourse. If you purchase from dubious characters you play by the rules of nature and not business. Once you have recourse they play by your rules.
Why would an Afghani or Columbian be any different from an American seller? 
Organised crime boomed in the prohibition times after a government arbitrarily decided to ban the sale of alcohol. Money laundering, prostitition and the mafia all flourished in that time.  What makes you think that if say, Adderall is banned, the same elements will not flock around it?

That would be true if bitcoin was a (edit) stock. Crypto-currencies are not bound by the rules of dividends and subsequent valuations. It is purely supply and demand, it has value due to a shared illusion. Just like gold. Why do the gold price jump when there is a rumour of war or conflict?

Bitcoin shortcodes are really simple to set up but the problem is the extremely high fees charged by network operators. I'm talking about between 35% to 100% markup. 
 If someone is willing to pay double the price for the convenience of buying a bitcoin via sms, then it's relatively straightforward.... except that you only receive the money from the network operator between 1 and 3 months later. If you don't hit your target amount of short code purchases that you anticipated, you will not receive a cent of your money. 
Also AML regulations caps shortcode purchases to about 20 usd. It's almost impossible to run a business like that. 
Financially it just doesn't make sense, except if you cut a deal with a rogue network operator to waive the high fees.

Also, the fact that terminal patients could safely buy euthanasia drugs without making family members accomplices was a step forward for humanity and humanness.

I can imagine that a music or video sharing platform that incorporates micropayments in their "like" or "upvote" buttons will be rather successful.  A user with say, $3 worth of btc in his tipping wallet, will not be too worried about fluctuations in the btc price.
It would be great if a fixed sum tip (for example 5 cents) could be subtracted from the tipping wallet automatically. This will marry micro payment crowdfunding  and social media.
Great idea and best of luck.

Superficially, gold is also potentially non fungible. An example would be the sanctions on South African Krugerrands during the Apartheid era.
In reality, those same Krugerrands could be molded and shaped into any form and they would be perfectly acceptable anywhere in the world.
I used to own a few coin operated pool tables many years ago. I installed them in some dodgy bars and soon found that there are a myriad of ways to bypass the coin reading mechanism. Some strategies were blunt and others more intricate. 
One way to play (almost) for free was to use Zimbabwe 20c pieces (when they still existed). They had almost no monetary value but were brought over the border to RSA by the truckload. They had the same exact shape and thickness as a South African R2 coin.
I was quite despondent to find my pool tables overflowing with these coins until I realised that I could use the same coins in other coin operated vending machines to purchase mobile phone credit, vouchers, snacks, toys etc.
These zim coins just continued to circulate in the vending machine economy for quite a while and everyone accepted that as a fact of life and turned a blind eye.
Redlisting and white-listing will only work if there is consensus in the bitcoin community that they want their coins to be listed. It's just too easy to re-mold your digital gold.

Excuses for what? It's about having the option to buy it, nothing more. You are probably right that the amount of people who bought it was really small. But it could be a much bigger market in the future if btc becomes more mainstream.

I buy bitcoin every month at BTCChina via vouchers. It is a really quick and streamlined process. It takes me about a minute to transfer RMB to the voucher seller's account, verify the purchase and buy bitcoin. I have also bought in-person in Shanghai.  It is a legit exchange and it seems like they are running a tight ship.

Great news, seems like the btc is converted to ZAR through bidorbuy (probably using bitx?). I guess if you want to buy something and the seller didn't enable the btc option, you can just message him and ask to enable it.
This is really, really big news for the SA bitcoin community. Takealot.co.za already accepts btc through payfast... and now this. Now we really can buy almost anything we need in SA with btc.

Are you in China now? Do you have a Chinese bank account and a Chinese SIM card? If you do, you can deposit money directly to BTCC (BTCChina) and send the bitcoin out to Coinbase. The whole process should take less than an hour.
If you don't have a bank account and can't open one (the process is relatively straightforward even if you are not a Chinese national), you can deposit cash in person at the BTCC office in Shanghai and this will be reflected instantly in your account.
I don't work for BTCC but I have used them regulary. They used to have a voucher system to circumvent government restrictions but now you can deposit directly.

Personally, the education in cryptography and math has been worth so much more than the few bucks I made.  Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Getting in on the game and understanding the underlying politics of open source will be critical for any future investor.  Having some stake in bitcoin forced me to learn much more about economy than I ever did at uni.
Not everyone needs to have some skin in the game to learn, but it certainly motivates most.
Also - the reasons you stated to invest in bitcoin yourself are intertwined.  Public policy with regards to purchasing of drugs will shift.  Public morals are not set in stone and legislation shifts where the money grows.

John Donahoe, eBay chief executive
shit's about to get real
EDIT: Full text
Ebay to expand the range of digital currencies it accepts
Ebay is preparing to expand the range of digital currencies it accepts and said that its payments unit PayPal may one day incorporate Bitcoin. “Digital currency is going to be a very powerful thing,” John Donahoe, eBay chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times.
The ecommerce group, which has more than 124m active users, is initially focusing on incorporating reward points from retailers’ loyalty schemes into its PayPal wallet. “We are building the container so any retailer could put their loyalty points into the PayPal wallet,” Mr Donahoe said. “There is a limit to how many cards you will carry, or remembering what points you have or don’t have,” he said. “But in a digital wallet, you can put 50 different loyalty cards.” Mr Donahoe said Ebay was not expanding the PayPal wallet to include Bitcoins, “but we are watching it”. “That same technology could accept other digital currencies,” he said. eBay’s efforts raise the possibility that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin may in time move beyond a niche role in online commerce. Some enthusiasts believe Bitcoin and other currencies that exist outside the traditional banking system represent the future of online payments. The work to expand the PayPal wallet underlines the emergence of virtual payment systems as the latest front in the battle between the global technology giants, including Google and Apple, to increase consumer reliance on their products. Corporate initiatives have sought to drum up interest in digital wallets for use online and on the high street. Companies from mobile and technology groups to banks and retailers are racing to use new mobile wallets to upend the payments business. Most of these efforts have focused on new ways of paying with traditional currencies such as the pound and the dollar, rather than with niche mediums of exchange such as loyalty points or Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are conducted through a peer-to-peer network of computers, outside the traditional banking system and largely beyond the control of governments and monetary authorities. The digital currency is accepted by very few retailers at present. Ebay has in recent years sought to bring more large retailers on to its ecommerce platform, which started as an auction side for small traders. Ebay recently teamed up with Argos to allow customers to collect goods from 150 of the British retailer’s stores. The ecommerce group also has a partnership with Nectar, the UK’s largest loyalty programme, allowing customers to collect points when they spend money through eBay. Mr Donahoe said that ecommerce had yet to combine the more “utilitarian” nature of shopping online, with the “social experience” of shopping at the mall or on the high street.

Let's imagine one bitcoin is worth 10usd and the market cap is in the area of 110 million. An unregulated money transfer company takes care of confirmations in effect rendering money transfers or remittances almost immediate. Said company holds 1000 bitcoins.  It can send 10 thousand dollars back and forth between their offices globally hundreds of thousands of times per day, in effect millions of dollars transmitted daily withouth having to "cash out" simply because one bitcoin is worth 10 dollar to someone on an unregulated marketplace (lets say silk road) stimulating economic growth and not robbing the economically fragile like western union and moneygram has done for decades.

yes, I have multiple printed paper wallets in fractions of bitcoins that I hand out and trade with my friends as currency. It's a very simple process to do. Also see Casascius coins if you want to get fancy.  Bitcoin are as physical as you would like it to be. In short, the private key printed on any surface makes that bitcoin/fraction of a bitcoin physical.


Nature isn't fair, the world isn't fair.  The percentage of people without mobile phone access or access to a person with mobile phone access (they don't actually need to be the person making the transaction, someone can do it for them, eg me doing online shopping for gran) is trivial enough for me to ignore.
If the internet shuts down right now, immediately without warning, there is going to be an apocalypse or at least semi-apocalyptic shitstorm. It won't be little fun collapse. A total, global blackout of the internet the only way that it will be impossible (or truly difficult) to send bitcoins.  Then barter will be king, not any form of coins.

Will be some of the last adopters. They are generally unskilled and semi literate (not always). However with simplified security and more advanced wallets, it's possible but unlikely.
2) Storefront merchants
such as internet cafe's, restaurants, coffee shops etc.
These merchants will lead adoption for many different reasons. Firstly, just the problem of getting change if someone pays with a $100 bill is challenging.  They use Rands as change but there is never enough.  If you need change in a supermarket and they run out, they just add some credit to your till slip for your next purchase.
Secondly, these merchants rely on foreign suppliers as not much is produced in Zimbabwe anymore... Every transaction from their suppliers is a cross border transaction.  Even South Africa don't have Paypal.  Purchasing something on Amazon for example, can be a real pain in the ass.  Our banking fees are brutal.  Probably the highest in the world.
It's more difficult to confiscate bitcoin and easier to hide. Bitcoin will be viewed as another asset class, out of the reach of government.  Even if the currency fluctuates, the merchants are wise enough not to keep too many eggs in one basket as they have learned the hard way in 1998-2001
I believe the possibility of web designers, developers, coders, journalists be paid in bitcoin and still stay with their families in Zim could be a major driving force.  Liquidity needs to be created first, though.
There are more than enough, highly educated and driven people in zim to spread bitcoin via word of mouth.  the benefits of crypto currencies has some more dimensions in Zimbabwe than most other places.

i think there will be slow and steady adoption.  No huge numbers but the adopters will play invaluable roles in the communities in terms of remitting money.
Africa sometimes skips certain technologies and embrace others to a high degree.
I'm pretty convinced the growth will be centred on m-pesa integration or even mxit (who still has a loyal client base and is looking to regain lost marketshare).
Sms payments (different to m-pesa) is also huge. This is a simple example of a relatively popular sms payment site.  
There are many more examples ranging from auction sites and prepaid electricity.
The concept of sending mobile credit (which can be bought by bitcoin) across borders and remittances is growing on a lot of people.

Importantly, we will see how the courts view bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.  Hopefully we will get some decent precedents and definitions that we can work on. All kinds of definitions etc are set in the obiter dictum. The courts' evolving view of bitcoin will be scrutinised for business adoption.  In a nutshell, this is an important step for bitcoin but don't expect the courts to get it right the first time. It's not the end of the world if they don't.

The roads are OK (potholes don't really matter on a bike that much) but the traffic can be extremely dangerous at times with trucks so I tend to cycle against the traffic.

No field repairs, touch wood.  But I did have about 60 punctures. Small things I fix with cable ties/wire/fibreglass duct tape

sky high because a government ban will legitimise it in the eyes of the ordinary folk.  Their worries about having to trust math will disappear because it has to be the real deal if the government bans it.  For the ban to be effective there has to be a form of international legislative cooperation to a level that we have never seen before.  Not going to happen.  A US government ban on Bitcoin will be the best thing to happen to the price of bitcoin since the halving.

don't invest more than you are willing to lose. you are being driven by emotion and it might backfire. It might also work but I would NOT recommend anyone to buy bitcoin on credit.

don't believe everything you see on CNN
Mobile cashless transactions (such as m-pesa or ecocash) are big in Africa and it is one of the few technological areas where Africa is leading the world. This, together with governments which are unable to regulate the free market; people who lived through hyperinflation (and therefore understand the relationship between government and money supply) and the culture of using mobile credit as a form of alternative currency, makes it one of the perfect testing environments for crypto-currencies.
Bitcoin can be integrated into these mobile payment systems and you can then buy anything anywhere in that country and **remit money** for a fraction of the cost of Western Union or Moneygram.
The fact that the ATM is offline is perfect as everyone is on the 3g network anyways.  A lot of people have smartphones in Africa.

If you were involved with bitcoin in 2011 you will know that there was no "major, unforeseen, technical flaw" in bitcoin itself. EDIT: The price went down to $1.  The reasons for the previous spike and dip is almost a carbon copy of the current one... Speculators getting jittery, gox screwing up, doom and gloom.
The fact is: 3600 bitcoin still come onto the market daily and demand has to match supply.  Parts of the media are still suffering from a "bitcoin hangover" and a new cycle of hype needs to start.
I am also excited about mpesa integration but you have to remember that in such a situation bitcoin will be used as a medium of transfer and not a store of value and it will have little impact on the price. Although in the long term, individuals will realise that they can bypass the fees and restrictions of mpesa by dealing directly with bitcoin.  This is not going to happen overnight.

Because a decentralised currency and governments are not compatible.  Bitcoin mimics a generation of a math based mineral which is immune from any government regulation if you apply yourself.  I am opposed to investors who want to work with regulators because they are not evolving faster than government catching on.

Once the market becomes aware of the fact that the coins flooding the seller side are from the Silk Road stash, it will mitigate the price drop because the source and reason for the coins on the market will be known.  The price will drop, but savvy investors will view it as a rare opportunity to acquire artificially reduced prices with all other circumstances constant.  This view will later transcend to the general buying public.
Prediction: very short term drop

They've been ignoring the cryptocurrency community for 2 years now. I've been offering to donate in bitcoin for at least 26 months. Always had the same reply:
**Hi guys, would love to donate. I don't have a credit card and I don't want to do a wire transfer out of principle. If you accept bitcoin as donation I will make a contribution. You can use a third party such as bitpay or bips so that you are not exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.**
**Regards frankros**
**Hi frankros,**
**Thanks for your email and for your interest in supporting free knowledge. Unfortunately we do not accept bitcoins. For a full list of other donation options, please visit  Thank you again for your interest!**
**Michael Beattie Donor Services Associate Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.**
Obviously they don't need donations. I couldn't care less if they accepted bitcoin now. Best I'll do is send some dust with a sarcastic message.
Edit [format]
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:33:40
How do you keep an alt currency regional? A primary function of bitcoin in the third world would be 1) the fast and easy transfer of funds from where the salary is paid (mostly far away from home). 2) Safeguard against runaway inflation 3) Safeguard against their own government and lastly as a speculative investment.  Bitcoin as a transfer medium would fulfill the most important roles.
I have seen lines and lines of people standing in line on payday to send money home.  Having worked in Saudi, I saw people without the proper legal document (Iqama) struggle tremendously to send some cash.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:10:39
That's pretty smart. Privacy is the next big thing. Anonimity should be prized. Anyways, my advice would be to invest in altcoin exchanges... Crypto is here to stay and there's going to be a lot of speculation on sites like vircurex. Don't invest too much and try to understand the fundamentals of each company.

I don't agree completely.  Globally, lawyers from any legal system may be looking at any uttering of a judge in a high profile bitcoin case, no matter how insignificant it might seem at the time.  Also, in Roman dutch law for example, obiter dictum has value and is used all the time.

I wouldn't use your gramps' gold for bitcoin.  use spare fiat.  If bitcoin continues to grow, it will cause huge disruptions and possibly lead to a great increase in the gold price.  The key here is educating yourself about crypto and related tech, worth so much more than some extra money.

So this means that in rural Africa, I can buy cell C / vodacom / MTN airtime and then in turn barter it for eggs/tabacco/maize, hell... even a bicycle. Bitcoin thus indirectly interacts with every small dealer and trader.  This does more than you can do with any credit card in Africa.  Now I can backpack to from South Africa to Egypt using only bitcoins and bitcoinwireless.  That would raise great awareness for bitcoin actually.

don't try to daytrade - therefore it's not necessary to keep any money or coins at an exchange or online wallet. It's just another party you have to trust. It doesn't matter how legit it seems.
Keep everything offline except the amount that want to spend.
Don't invest in bitcoin related stocks unless you have serious inside info or know the owners very well.
If you want to diversify into alt coins, go for coins that offer something markedly different.  I believe altcoins are at a low now and you should play around a little with them.  The amount of developers actively involved in the altcoin is key.

zim has ecocash - like mpesa but with higher transaction fees. It really irks the average person on the street that they have to pay 5% per transaction. As far as I know, you pay for sending and receiving.
Cash is sometimes very hard to come by with ATM's running out of USD and getting change can be a nightmare.

This is true, but also trivial. you have to remember that USD are digital too. only a fraction of dollars are in circulation. The rest are also stored in digital format. therefore requiring the 3 points stated above.
Also, persons without mobile phone access typically will not be a players in the economy.  They will typically be very elderly people who can be looked after by the younger generation, infants or disabled/retarded.
"luxuries" are subjective. I would not classify internet access or a mobile phone as a luxury at all anymore. In fact it is probably very close to being declared an international human right.  It already is in some countries (internet access).
In an absolute worst case scenario as you sketched above, any kind of currency is not going to get you anywhere. Even gold is going to be worthless. who wants to lug a heavy piece of metal with him that can't even keep shape as a useful knife.  In that situation I would rather opt for a fist full of dollars, at least you can start a fire with it.

Not all miners are driven by financial incentive. It's a hobby for a lot of people, a passion.  Most people lose money on a more convential hobby and nobody blinks an eye.
Also, does it make financial sense for a high paying developer in his day job to spend hours (thousands of dollars that he could have been paid working on a company product)  every week contributing to the source code? 
Bitcoin brought an interest in economics to many in the tech savvy crowd but they are not necessarily motivated by financial gain.

If you want to have the value of your BTC increase, it will probably be better if you engaged the development of bitcoin startups or exposing merchants to the advantages of bitcoin acceptance.

yes, I agree that some dilution will appear.  But for exactly the same reasons that they are so similar, they are extremely interchangeable.  In essence one can then look at altcoins as an extension of bitcoin.  An extension that possibly safeguards bitcoin in the same way as mirror sites.
Unrelated: if you are interested in alternative crypto currencies - perhaps have a look at freicoin. Demurrage is a very interesting concept and one we will possible see much more of in the future.

They put a small amount of their money into a project that they don't fully grasp the possibilities of...

Also, they were pretty late to the party for so called "tech guys".
I don't care if they are privileged or not, that doesn't come into the equation for me.  I have followed their views on bitcoin since when they publicly said they invested. Nothing of value.

Another thing that you should know about bitcoin right from the start is that you should not trust anybody except for yourself to keep your wallet safe. not even the most reputable online wallet services. not exchanges, nothing. your first step in education should be this   Some people will differ from me, but if you feel uncertain about your technical skill level, you should at least put your bitcoin on a paper wallet (as explained in the link) until you feel comfortable with securing your client/wallet files.  Use small test amounts first and try it out.  here, this will get you started. +bitcointip beguilesmile ฿0.01 verify. Hope it will be worth a lot more in future for you.

On the road, I have been thinking about a concept of a mobile credit stock exchange, where mobile credit vouchers can be sold for bitcoin and vice versa. Even if seller takes a 5% loss on the airtime (mobile credit) it is still cheaper than to wire money to an exchange to get small amounts of bitcoin.  
Sites such as the bitcoinwireless (wtf happened to them?) could be a crucial player and could create instant liquidity in the markets as mobile credit is can be bought by a family member abroad and sent home or vice versa.

If porn embraces bitcoin, your bitcoins will be worth a lot more. A small donation will probably in the long run contribute.

there's going to have to be global legislative cooperation to an extent never seen before in  history for governments to put some kind of leash on bitcoin. It's never going to happen but they will probably try anyways.  It will be to the economic benefit of the countries not trying to regulate it.  The whole bitcoin economy can be run from a small country like swaziland through third parties if necessary.

Having anything to do with mtgox is really unnecessary, risky and a bad move imho.
In terms of a selling contract, once the btc is reflected in your wallet after a few confirmations, you are not at risk of losing it.  Just use a different wallet (offline) than mtgox.

use a paper wallet. Good for you for taking your money out of mtgox. you can also put a small amount in a brain wallet. use a very secure phrase.

this advice is also relevant to not storing all (or any) of your bitcoins in an online wallet.  If you lose your bitcoin that way, you will not find too much sympathy.  If you can wrap your head around the concept of bitcoin, you should be able to take control of your own bitcoin.

i will target internet cafes and informal airtime (mobile credit) sellers to evangelise.  Airtime is already as much of a alternative currency in much of Africa. It is not unheard of for workers to be paid their wages partly in airtime.  the barter economy is strong in most places so the average person is not too bound to the idea of fiat.  Zimbabwean hyperinflation is still fresh in the minds of most.  For someone in Zim to know that his money will have the same value as anyone else in the world (even if it devaluates - but at the same rate)will already lend a form of "intrinsic value" to bitcoin.  Remember that in general, someone in the extended family is working abroad and making big bucks.  That wealth needs to be spread to other members of the family.  Bitcoin will make that much less of a pain in the ass.  FFS a massive percentage don't even have ID documents, how can they send and receive money from traditional banks?

Thank you for your well thought out reply and questions.
I am going to see how many questions I can answer.  These are mainly going to be about Zimbabwe as it is where I see the most potential. I hope I don't offend any Zimbos with my answers as these are just observations and the issues and answers are obviously way more complex.


Traditionally cattle is the way to store value. Cattle is the backbone of wealth even for the most educated and even for those working abroad in various fields.  Owning cattle is and will always be a symbol of status. In many areas, if you don't own cattle, your children will find it difficult to marry.  Cattle is like gold, except cattle has inherent value.


Almost every single person in Zimbabwe owns a mobile phone. In the cities, the middle class will have smartphones, blackberries mostly.  Africa took to mobile phones in a big way.  Those who don't have smartphones yet, will have smartphones in the next 2 years.  At least those who are economically active. To put it another way, if you don't have a phone and living in a rural area with no coverage, someone in your close family (such as a grandchild) will be able to receive remitted money for you.


Most Zimbabwean expats live in South Africa, but also many work in other neighbouring countries.  Mostly those with tertiary education or family contacts will work in the UK or other Commonwealth countries.  Every person that I spoke to has a family member or two working abroad and remitting money.  My feeling is that money is remitted mostly by western union, wire transfers, cash (from neighbouring countries)


In Harare, there is a backpackers called Small World which as free wifi and they use the dining room area as a conference centre for young entrepreneurs.  Free wifi zones (or cheap zones) seems to attract the young elite and brightest minds.  There are quite a number of those in Harare and Bulawayo for example.


Most products are imported from South Africa at the moment, although Zim has the capacity to be extremely self sufficient.




Any person who does not agree with the Mugabe regime.
I will answer your other questions in the next post

if you have held your bitcoins for more than a year the capital gains tax will be significantly lower than the 40% you stated. Probably a little under 20%.  I would suggest you pay it and get some peace of mind. otherwise your newly found wealth may lead to some paranoia.

the main challenge is creating liquidity in less tech advanced countries. Otherwise the "free transfer" is not free at all because it has to be converted into the home currency.
In Africa, this headache can be solved by using mobile credit as an intermediary.
All you need is a company such as Bitcoinwireless to stop fannying about and get up and running.
Bitcoin received can be used to buy mobile credit (airtime vouchers) which can, in turn be sold or traded. I estimate one out of every 5 informal traders in Sub Saharan Africa sells mobile credit vouchers as pre-paid is a big thing there.
Bitcoin can also be integrated into M-pesa with apps such as Kipochi.
Does anyone know of a service that sells global mobile credit vouchers?!

@_date: 2013-10-25 00:27:46
Mobile cashless transactions (such as m-pesa or ecocash) are big in Africa and it is one of the few technological areas where Africa is leading the world. This, together with governments which are unable to regulate the free market; people who lived through hyperinflation (and therefore understand the relationship between government and money supply) and the culture of using mobile credit as a form of alternative currency, makes it one of the perfect testing environment for crypto-currencies.
edit: bitcoin can be integrated into these mobile payment systems and you can then buy anything anywhere in that country and remit money for a fraction of the cost of Western Union or Moneygram.

the big players will hopefully create an industry around it if they are really smart. Some of them will most likely be reselling at 10% above mtgox price or at least that's what I would do.

I am conflicted about blogging... Don't really like to share where I am going and who I am but I think it will be beneficial in the long run if it only bitcoin related.
Before I return on my next leg, I will do another few posts here to test the water.
If I have a wallet address which can be used for small promo-coins, I would probably fund them myself, as it will just be used to show how easy it is to use etc. A few cents or so will suffice.
Thank you very much, however.
If my second shift gathers momentum, and I feel that some entrepreneurs will benefit from slightly larger amounts for specific reasons, I might ask a well known person in the bitcoin community (like yourself) to be the guardian of the wallet. This way, more donations might flow, rather than trusting someone like myself who might (for all they know) just disappear with the coins without major consequences.
Most transfers can then be done via public forums like reddit as the entrepreneur will then possibly have to do a small presentation on what he will try to achieve and answer questions if he feels like it.

once the market realises that the BTC is being sold off from the confiscated coins, they will know that the protocol is still sound and it is only a temporary supply issue. buyers will lap it up and the price will rebound swiftly. Seems rational to me.

even if you own property, bonds etc, it is still linked to your home currency. Therefore it is all kind of in the same "basket" and they have just been devaluated by 10% in about 3 days in South Africa.  Having the opportunity to own some currency that cannot be devaluated by a central govenment on a whim, is a luxury that did not exist for Zimbabweans in 1998.  If you have lived through hyperinflation and don't own at least some bitcoin, you have only yourself to blame for not learning your lesson if things go really pear shaped in a developing country.  Owning too much bitcoin if you can't afford to lose it will be a high risk investment but owning none is a much higher risk.

This could be a game changer.  Airtime in itself is a type of informal currency, especially in Africa.  It is sometimes bartered or traded for whatever is at hand or in season.  Wages are sometimes partly paid in airtime where I am from.  Even if bitcoin has only one function ever, namely purchasing or distributing airtime, it could potentially positively affect massive amounts of people.

Don't be disappointed if it's only a mild influx of money from China this week.  Who knows. People need time to digest all the information when it is the first time they hear something this novel.  There's a difference between downloading the client and investing hard earned money.  Personally I believe if there is an upswing in price this week, it will be from the traditional bitcoin countries like US, Germany, UK, Netherlands etc reacting to the seeming tacit approval of the Chinese government and not yet of the Chinese citizens themselves... that will come a little later.

As illustrated by the spectacularly rapid growth in Mobile phone payment technology such as M-pesa and other innovations such as Mxit, combined with weak central governments and a real lack of alternative payment options, Africa will soon become a real bitcoin bastion.  I have no doubts about that.  Anyone who has ever tried to transfer money from Africa to Europe will attest to that.  In no area in the world is a mobile phone so central to the financial well being of the individual.

I agree mostly with what you are saying but remember that Gox's dominance is broken and we have 4 big players now with other rising in the ranks.  The interrelation between exchanges will temper flash crashes to a considerable extent.
Also, Chinese investment mentality might be different than the one that drove the previous spikes.
Seeing as we are playing this little game... I predict a rise between $750 to $1250 with a correction to roughly $500 but only for about 6 week before the next rise starts.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:45:14
market depth is greater than it is at the start of a weekend. The price experienced some great fluctuations already over the past week.  Normally a weekend dip is preluded by steep price growth and little depth.  I wouldn't be surpised however, if the market does fall a little over the weekend but I think the usual factors are not in place.

You are quite right, it is called Mpesa and it is huge. There is also a program called Mxit and some other innovations.  Sorry, I don't have any resources other than some experience and a few basic articles like    to pique your interest.

I can definitely deliver it, no problem. The question is how to print a flag so quickly. I'll go to a mall tomorrow morning and ask around. If all else fails, I will make one by hand with some arts and crafts material...fuck it.

almost the same as you. fellow Saffer reporting in. Warning: take your coins out of Mtgox and onto a paper wallet if you don't know what the function of the bitcoin client is. Seriously, don't put all your eggs in one basket.

that's hilarious.

It's only money. Go learn to sail or something and stop obsessing.

Okthen... don't say I didn't warn you.  Just take control of your own wallet. It's not that hard.

I don't think it is a question of shutting down, but rather whether they will keep a specific discount rate provided by their supplier.  They will probably continue but with slightly higher prices.

I agree, it's shit.

Which country are you from?  You don't always need to meet a person face to face on localbitcoins, you can use email escrow. Many people use this service.
See the section on escrow

It doesn't but now there is less of a limited commodity, making it scarcer and therefore more valuable.

mtgox. the big winner today.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:11:43
what about the when the forking issue happened? all the plebcoins' prices moved inverse quite strongly.  Although, it wasn't quite a crash from bitcoin.  Certainly very, very nervous times.
I don't think altcoin prices are correlated to bitcoin's price at all.

have a look at cryptostocks exchange. vcx still has some potential although it has risen rapidly this last week.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:39:12
thanks. quite delayed data though. I'll look at it again in a few days
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:47:56
the link doesn't work.  But I know what you  are talking about.  Google trends is delayed and it doesn't include the latest data.  This always makes the charts look like they are dipping.  I can assure you it's not.  It's rising quite rapidly.

that's what a brain wallet is there for mate.  You are welcome to stick it up your bum if you get a kick out if it though.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:06:43
Don't know really, its not my game. it depends on how many confirmations the exchanges need for your funds to clear. I'm sure the answer will pop up in this thread though.

Folks don't take kindly to litecoin/altcoins around these parts. you'll notice it soon enough ;)

paper wallet carrier pigeons. Edit: only half joking. it's possible to send a million dollar by pigeon now if you take the risk.  It kind of has some real world applications.

yes, sir!
