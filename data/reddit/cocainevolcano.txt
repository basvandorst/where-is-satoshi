I just tried this after reading your post. Holy shit, you're right. I just bought $10 of bitcoin with my credit card and have ~26mbtc on my bitcoin app on my phone all in minutes. The last time I bought bitcoin was about a year ago, and it took me about 6 hours.
I had to go deposit cash into a random person's bank account, email the receipt to a third party, then wait for the seller to verify the funds were received, then wait for the bitcoin to be released.
It was sketchy as fuck, and the minimum purchase was for $400, so I was very worried all evening. Every one I have told about the process shook their heads incredulously about how sketchy it was. 
This is really amazing that we're here now.

I remember watching the charts on my phone at work while on break, and just being way too excited. I didn't even know what bitcoin was, I only had heard about it a few months earlier when the guy invested his life savings. I knew I had to get get involved after that. I started reading about it and learned about the underlying technology and have been a fan boy ever since. Good times.

Forgive me, after seeing your flair and google I realize I'm about as ignorant of a devil's advocate that I can be here, but how so? Considering my first situation I outlined, where they mine their own coins solo on a VPN (assuming the VPN does indeed not keep records) and a one-time transaction from that wallet takes place to make, say, a donation. Could that wallet ever be tracked back to that individual? I've heard some talk before about how VPNs are in the process of being cracked and can be tracked, but that hasn't occurred yet(?) and if it were,  are you saying that they could be retroacticely tied to an ISP in the future?
@_date: 2016-11-05 05:52:43
I get what you're saying, but it sounds pedantic. The OP sounds like a layman like myself, and for what I assume are their intents and purposes, bitcoin can be used anonymously. It's just defined as, "unable to tie the oublic key of the wallet back to the individual." That is, as long as no physical, real-world connections take place between the individual and their wallet transactions, ie buying something and it is delivered to their address.

I think btc is a great thing, but so are banks. The power of inherently inflationary currency is that it incentivizes investing. It rewards those who take risk and try new ways of doing business. As a result, any one who wants to keep value on their money must contribute to the machine. It greases the wheels that turn human progress. Fuethermore, it gives power to the little guy. Any one with decent credit and a solid business plan can go out and get a loan today. He has the power, because the investor is always desperate to lend their money,  because lent money is protected from inflation. I think btc can still do these things,  it's just that fiat is truly ideal for it. Moving money is crucial for a healthy economy.

Idk, the first place I went to was youtube for instructions on how to buy btc, and they all said to download a wallet first, then get an account at an exchange, buy the coins, then transfer to said wallet. Of course, that was the first place on my info journey. I spent a week looking around to make sure I didn't miss any info, because, that gut feeling of insecurity wouldn't go away until I was sure I would be safe. I *think* most people would behave the same, as I myself am not a techie, by any means. 
I think facebook is different. People have shitty passwords on those and are careless because honestly, who really cares if your friends hack your account. The contents of mine and most peoples' facebook accounts are largely meaningless and worthless to them I think. I know my siblings could hack mine. However, there's no chance they could hack my bank account password, let alone my btc wallet. Those passwords matter and I take those seriously. I would bet most people are similar in that respect.

I am a perfect example of what you're saying. Three months ago, I had no idea what bitcoin was. I had heard of it, but no clue what it was or how it worked. Admittedly, it was the lifesavings 30k redditor investor from a few months ago that grabbed my interest in the first place. Once I heard about the impending bubble, I waited for the pop. Once the pop hit, I've been researching bitcoins non stop. I told a bunch of friends and coworkers all about it, too. They hadn't even hears of bitcoins before. Now they know what they are. I'm hooked on the idea now and cannot wait to start buying coins. Slowly and cautiously, mind you, but I'll be buying what I can afford here in the months to come. This is all very exciting.

I want to argue that it is not the only way, however I am not educated enough to do so. The volatility control while maintaining decentralized/disorganised status would require some kind of visionary reinventing to make happen. Idk. As I mentioned also, though, is that the exchange process is still complicated and needs to be simplified for new, interested supporters. If a new currency was made where an exchange like Gox existed that I could safely use debit cards on, a lot more people would be jumping in the market. Honestly though, I am very very new to all this, so if I'm sounding like a total idiot to you right now, I'm sorry for wasting your time :l

They've only heard *of* bitcoins, without any idea of the advantages. It took me at least a couple of weeks of reasearching the topic and lurking this sub to understand any benefits of btc vs. conventional cash. 
After knowing everything about them, there's still barely any use for btc for the average individual. The only use that I have myself is risky long term investment/speculation and maybe gambling. I have never had a need for bank wires or even paypal, and I think a lot of people are in that boat with me. Dollars, for me, for now, are ten times more convenient to use for 99% of anything to do with my finances. 
The exchange process being complex and sketchy sounding for the uneducated is a huge barrier for those interested as well. It takes a lot of work and research for someone to go from seeing bitcoin in an article to owning their first in their wallet.

Me too my minneapolite brother. All this talk of subways recently has gotten me craving it.

I got it for just under 1.5 coins.. my initial investment cost for those coins was ~$200. Can't complain!

Even if a person successfully lowers the price by 50$/coin in a short period, in order for he plan to work they'd have to be confident that it would rise back up again soon. Idk, that kind of trickery seems foolish to me, maybe I'm missing something..

This happened to me today. Sent payment, then my browser refreshed and there was no evidence of an order, it just went back to log on/register. My wallet sent the coins..I emailed em, bur haven't received a reply yet, about 6 hours so far. I'll try calling tomorrow I guess.

Layman here, but there is a lot of talk about present issues with bitcoin. Issues that are perceived to be slowing down its growth. If the issues can be solved with a similar currency, while keeping the positive aspects of bitcoin, then it would make sense that people would shift over to it. I'm not saying it is definite, but possible. Imagine if a currency like bitcoin in every way was made this week, only it was much easier to purchase for newcomers, and was much less prone to volatility, based on its inherent design? Is it possible? Maybe, that's why I keep listening. 
Edit- a word

Young investors are encouraged to/ logically should take more risk though, to an extent. If you're under 28, investing ~10% of your portfolio in a high risk venture for a few years won't be the end of you.

They emailed me back, reassured me that they've been having issues with not just me and they're working it out. Asked me to verify the transaction with a link to the blockchain. As OP said, they just need to verify with bitpay and the order will go through as planned. Things look good for now :)

That sounds totally ridiculous.  I'm not allowed to liquidate my investments and deposit them in my bank at 5% per week?

There is one, gimme a sec

Without investors,  competition stagnates, and monopolies are more easily formed though, right..? Serious ques.

B-b-b-but the profits! Have you *seen* the graphs! Disco sales are on the up up up! (simpson's ref)

Solution- Manufacture your own miner.  It's not impossible,  and as you said there are thousands and thousands to be had. I'd do it myself, but I don't know diddly about computers.

Thanks, dick. "Oh, you were addicted to opium before? Huh... Hey, have you ever tried *heroin*?"

At first I was like fuck you for not believing me, started recalling loss stats over the years
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:37:40
Most tips I've seen have been for under a dollar. No one cares that someone tipped a guy 38 cents. Maybe if people started tipping 5$ minimum things would be different

Why not? I think most won't risk their money to buy bitcoin until they trust it, and they won't trust it until they have become knowledgeable about it, since most will out of instinct not trust it. All the info that is needed is right here, online, be it google, youtube, or forums. It may take a lot of people a week or two to go from zero knowledge to a decent understanding, where they have an account with an exchange and a strong password protected offline wallet, but it's not rocket appliances/surgery. Hell, it only took me about a week to do so.

I bought a  50" flat screen on bitcoinstore.com a couple weeks ago. I feel like I may regret that decision now..

Idk, it was the allure of speculation that brought me into bitcoin at first back in April. I started reading about bitcoins then, because I knew nothing about them besides that they were exploding in value. I was so excited to speculate, I was telling everybody I knew about the bubble and the unheard of swings in price. Now, after finally buying my first couple coins in October, I am long on btc. I bought mine literally 12 hours before news of the SR shutdown. Didn't sell then, won't sell now. Will buy more if it crashes, too ;)
 All I'm saying is, the sensational speculation can be a good way to increase awareness and eventual adoption.
