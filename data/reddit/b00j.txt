I imagine this isn't just a drive thru car wash at the gas station it's probably a couple hours of full detailing inside and out. not everyone has the time or even a place to wash their vehicle at home (condo/apartment living for example) so to get it done by a professional with the proper equipment is worth paying for to people with the income for it.

That link is garbage information and obviously very biased.

Lol I'm actually dying right now... You're just making up arguments I haven't even mentioned now haha
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:40:43
Hahaha and right there you show your obvious lack of knowledge. You realize crypto isn't just used for currency right? You also realize bitcoin will almost undoubtedly not be the main crypto for payment processing /currency.... right? BTC has shown time and again they can't just rapidly add functions and make them usable. (where's lightning network rapid deployment?)

What? Lol it's not data it's a fucking reddit comment and an unobjective one at that. Blindly thinking btc will be the only crypto needed/used in the future shows you're lack of understanding in the subject matter but enjoy your time outside reality ��

Unfortunate that these exchanges will allow people to fund without KYC and then all of a sudden they trap your funds and refuse to process your only form of ID for verification. Super shady business practices and I definitely won't be supporting Circle or Poloniex.
Upvote for you man, I hope this gets seen by the right eyes and solves your issue!

Also, in the publication dates at the end of whitepaper if you click the link to the hashcash paper the date it's published is 2002/08/01...one of the clues OP gave is to think in pairs. do the dates references ties to other whitepapers? are their specific words linked in both papers that could provide clues maybe?

I assume he is referring to something similar to the Elastos project?

Volume went up 8 million in 30 minutes but that's about it.

Except take over a company he had no idea how to run and willfully neglect security protocols despite warnings.

Apparently between all their operations they now hold $5 billion

You're prone to scamming through anything. Phone/internet, bank, insurance even door to door sales. Doesn't mean it will stop effective ideas from being implemented.

How is crypto's sole business scams? Lol

I was going to put effort into a reply like this but I peeked at his profile and realized a sensible discussion wasn't going to take place anyways and wasn't worth it...

What's wrong with IOTA? Has huge potential and they've been making the right moves lately if you ask me...
