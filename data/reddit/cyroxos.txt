I respect you for making clear arguments, but I think you are a little trigger-happy with your "troll" accusations. Not everyone puts effort into what they post. You get 14 year old kids, and 60 year old shut-ins and not everyone who makes a statement against yours is trying to "troll" you. When you throw the "troll" word around you loose a bit of credibility. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:24:24
This doesn't make any sense to me. 


And you can't spend money if you don't have it.. unless you partake in some sort of credit or loan situation.
You still haven't indicated why it's risky to hold onto their own bitcoin. Why? Because you want to "manage" it for them as take a profit from doing so. This is nothing different than stock brokers or whatever. This forum is not a place for your paid services.
Clever username though ;) Thanks for replying to me.

You have a valid point, however bitcoin is a store of value. If you are a bank, and make your money by making (and managing) money, do you cash out your USD money every week to buy chairs? Okay although somewhat silly, what if people are actually holding on to excess profits as a store of value, or spending the profits (to offset the cost of mining) by buying goods and services using BTC which just transfers it around. Your initial example didn't include business transactions that aren't market-driven speculation.
Personally I hate people trying to make money from the fluctuating price of bitcoin... I actually believe in it as a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:48:20
makes sense
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:09:26


Yes, there are many types. Some people use bitcoin as a way of sending information which is pretty neat (Etherium, BigChainDB...).
You know, you're right, I should be savvy and have high-tech investment strategies for my bitcoin holdings. But then again, 400% increase in 6 months isn't bad for just keeping it in once spot and not worrying about other people messing around with it. I know it's unsustainable and that's your whole point, so after the price finds its new plateau maybe I'll consider talking to my 401K provider about what bitcoin options they have.
How is using bitcoin as a currency reckless? Why does it matter how much it costs? The protocol can sub-devide into very small fractions, so spending .00001 btc isn't a problem as far as I know. If you mean that it is reckless because of the volatility, maybe, but that's how things work. The places that I know that accept bitcoin constantly adjust their prices based on the market value so it's a non-issue.

I see, and I understand your perspective. I had about $2500 in bitcoin when it was in the range of 6-20 and used all of it up. A woman walked into my shop years later (obviously not computer literate) and said something about hearing that bitcoin was over 1K on the radio. My head sank and later that night I enjoyed some whisky. 
I too wish that the price would drop down to 200 again so I could re-invest. And that giant blip on the charts does have this receding eb-and-flow quality to it. However, I have looked at the previous booms and suspect that the proliferation of bitcoin knowledge, industry, volume, and utility will only drive the value up further. 
It will be a rocky road, but that is the character of the bitcoin market so far. I think the real challenge now is trying to pinpoint the local low and begin investing. It seems pretty low right now ( I just bought at 780 this morning), and I am easing in every time it goes down. No big investments, just enough to at least not feel bad if it jumps up higher.

This is pretty inspiring. The bitcoin storage device is called a "wallet". Not to be trite, but if the role was reversed and the official bitcoin client was called a "purse", I would feel conflicted. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:36:42
I bet it just stays around 800 until something big happens in the news and it shoots up to 1K again before returning to stability.

well yes, okay. I agree. Sorry, I thought something was up.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:10:15
Agreed, luckily it is self-evolving. Call me an optimist, but I have faith that people will continue to contribute to it and make it a standard of value. There is a lot of propaganda out there, and a lot of people who just speculate it as a way of getting rich quick, but you have to believe in the core idea; I think that idea is quite transformative and has proven that it's more than a pipe-dream.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:52:19

It is a problem for some situations, and not others. In this case, there have been solutions to the transaction fee problem (litecoin, as someone said "nano" but i don't know about that one, lightning (probably more for companies using lots of microtransactions), or other things that haven't been implemented yet). 
Luckily, I only send bitcoin for utility payments to my landlord, and the speed of these payments can be a few days so I only end up paying like a dollar in fee. This fee is less than the $3 I would normally spend on a money-order/cashiers check/wire transfer so that's why I use it.

@_date: 2019-06-29 01:56:05
I put crazy low transaction fees on my transfers, and so far, even at 20% lower than the lowest recommended fee, my transactions are still going through. Cool.
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:12:39
I think that is a fair argument. Again, the reason I have been supporting the Bitcoin protocol since 2008 is because I believe in it. If you think you have a better idea, propose it. That's not meant to sound condescending. I think your frustrations are fairly common. Some investment firms and 3rd parties support Bitcoin as a middle-man. Imagine if you had to make the ACH transfer yourself.. I'm sure it has its problems too, but the Bank acts as the responsible party. Bitcoin is still in a fledgling state, and the fact that it has caused Banks of all things to up their game I think is pretty incredible. 
I'm sorry I don't have a better solution for you, I'm no expert in this field.
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:18:49
Is there any evidence of someone doing this and getting the whole block reward? I guess you could look block explorer and find a block that's not claimed by a known mining group, but I haven't seen one.

Similar to what KZSpectre said, as far as I know, every bank I've ever used has charged for moving money and it takes around 3 business days. 
There is PayPal (shutter) which is probably what most people use, Venmo, etc, and that's great because banks are terribly behind the times. 
There is one main reason why I still prefer Bitcoin, it is not owned by a single company... Even if there are some nuances or sacrifices that need to be made (for now), I can rest easy knowing that JPMorgan isn't micro-investing my $200 utility bill while it is in a 3 day limbo moving to another account AT THE SAME BANK. Similarly, PayPal has a horrendous track record for customer service, and has held or seized funds for almost everyone I know that has used it.

quick question. Can someone begin mining without being part of a pool, such that it is very unlikely to discover a block, but if they do, they get the whole 25 or whatever BTC?

Start of the week tends to do this. I think miners cash out today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:39:35
is that the probability per second? You would think that your odds would be better than winning the lottery, since there are likely more people playing the lottery than mining bitcoin. Maybe there are more miners (or at least enough big-time miners with tons of hardware). 
Internet told me the odds of winning the "mega bazillions" lottery is 249,2561,738/1 and the number you provided is 175,711,536/1. Assuming that you can run the miner for a long time, it could be worth it.

a whale sells a whole bunch, people panic because they see a 5% drop all the sudden and sell too. Then there's a 10% drop and a lot of auto-sells get triggered. Now it's down 15% and those auto-sells are now buying at the lower price. Others are still selling, but there is a short to be made on the dead cat bounce. Price rises about 8% before going down again, dampening until stability again. If it is quickly stable and higher than expected, it may still ride momentum back up to where it was.
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:24:32

Years ago, people would rob trains carrying gold from out west. People used to be able to walk into a bank, pull a gun out, and steal pretty much the whole vault. Now, there are ways of making this not as easy. Similarly, people will learn how \*not\* to store digital wealth. I mean, look at some of the biggest companies (Facebook, Sony, Equifax, etc) and how they let their data get hacked all the time. 
At some point people will realize that a lot of these \*hacks\* are the result of the laziness or negligence of the company.

As far as I know, during surge periods the fee goes up. So if you don't like that, just wait a week or so.

They may be high now, but if I recall a few months ago, it was just a few cents.
