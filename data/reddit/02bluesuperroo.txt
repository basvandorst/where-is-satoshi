At Coinigy we are ready and committed to adding a full node to help support the increased block size.  We'd prefer to implement one of the self-scaling block size solutions that have been proposed but whichever way the community goes, we feel this is a necessary step in the evolution of Bitcoin and are prepared to put our money where our mouth is.

This type of complaining I'm seeing here makes me really sad.  Everyday people who use software really are clueless as to the kind of time and experience that is required to make good products.  They've been tainted by startup investors who are the ones paying for you to use the product.  
Do you think twitter is really free?  Below are their net income numbers for the last 4 years (yes, that's in millions of USD lost).  This is simply not sustainable and one day if they don't monetize, their funding will dry up and twitter will go bye bye.  Or, they can monetize by farming all your personal information and selling it so that advertisers can target you with ads on their platform.  Of course, this would be a gross violation of personal privacy but who cares, amirite? At least it's free...   It's OK for Google to make billions of dollars farming our personal data but it's not ok for a small startup to charge you $.002 per transaction so they can stay afloat?  Anyone reading this is on reddit and they're no doubt farming your data as you sit and read this post.  I know it's a cliche but if you're not paying for a product, you ARE the product.

I'm not sure that there is actually a mechanism for it in the code at this point or not but the way I understand it is a bitcoin transfer would be "flagged" as having been moved off the main blockchain and onto a side chain.  At this point a new coin would show up at a deposit address on the side chain. The flagged amount on the main blockchain would not be available to transfer.  When you move it back the deposit address on the side-chain would get debited the amount of the transfer and the flag would get rest on the main chain, thus moving the bitcoin back onto the main blockchain.

They don't store it nice and safe.  They don't care what happens to it.  Their protocol during a robbery is to give it up. They don't insure it either, the government (you) pays for it when something happens like a robbery (or a bailout)
They allow you to access it (within limits) from ATM's nationwide that they don't own or maintain yet will still charge you a fee for using.  Worse yet, have you ever tried to send some of YOUR money to someone else same-day from your bank?  You want to talk about fees!! 
There is no bank account that pays interest above inflation.  They wouldn't be able to make money off your money if they did that.   It's tough to even find a CD that pays more than inflation.  You sound like a bankster yourself (or just a troll).

It'd be nice to know what country we're referring to if you're going to cite shit about UK banks and I'm talking about US banks.  I apologize for assuming we were talking about the US.
I stand corrected about FDIC insurance.  I didn't know the banks paid insurance premiums for it.  A lie... not quite.  But definitely incorrect.  
As you can see here, the US inflation rate is typically 2-4%.  The best savings account rate you can get anywhere in the US, at an online only bank, is roughly 1%.  And it's not tax free.  There is no such thing as a tax free bank account that earns capital gains (interest).  If you look here, you'll see that a 3-year CD (where you can't get your money out for 3 years) is only paying 1.5% interest.  
Yes, inflation has been lower thanks to a stagnant economy.  However, in the US, interest rates on savings accounts used to actually be even lower, if available at all.
You can't send anything in the US same-day without wire transfer fees.  You can send "pop money" (if your bank participates) but it takes 3-5 days just like any other ACH transfer.  Wire transfers are usually $10-$15 or more.
I understand they make money off mortgages and loans.  They can't get money from central banks to loan out if they don't have any collateral.  The collateral is your money.  They need to hold enough of it, which is why they make it harder for you to get it.  That's why all the banks in the US will charge you a fee if you take money out of your savings account more than 3-5 times in a month.
You obviously don't know anything about the US banking system, and I don't know anything about the UK banking system, so it's pretty stupid to argue about whether apples are red or oranges are orange.

The man still has a point.  If the Lightning Network is to succeed, then Bitcoin must be incapable of processing some number (N) of transactions per some time period (T).  So it would literally get them thrown out of their own company if they were to support or help implement something that makes their product irrelevant. If you can't see that then you are the blind one.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:29:47
But actually your point is still wrong and Jensuth is right because the Federal Reserve won't give them that money you refer to unless they are holding a certain amount of reserves (your money).  Only if they screw up and don't keep enough or lose your money, it's ok because the insurance will pay you back your money with (your money).

The banks don't provide the insurance, the tax payers do.  Of course the banks are working fine, they're making billions of dollars a year doing what they do.  Nobody is arguing whether the bank works or not.  The painfully naive statement you made was that you hadn't paid a dime in fees to your bank in 15 years.  I didn't know there were people who knew how to use the internet who were that unaware of the world around them.
EDIT: I've since been corrected; The banks pay the insurance premiums for FDIC, not taxpayers.

He's under the same illusion now.  The majority of the new people with health insurance were previously denied for preexisting conditions and/or have a huge backlog of unaddressed medical problems.  Those extra dollars he's paying aren't for him, they're for all the people that the insurers were forced to cover that they previously excluded because they couldn't afford to cover them under their current pricing structure. Yes, I know they probably could have if they weren't taking huge execute bonuses and salaries but nothing about Obama Care changed _that_.

$124/month for an individual where the per-capita income is $16,000 or $1300/month.  So private health insurance costs about 10% of monthly income in Brazil, plus you have to pay the taxes for the public system.
In the US for an individual on a non-work sponsored plan under the ACA of similar age to the example above would cost $535/month with a per-capita income in the US of $54k.  What do you know, a little over 10% of monthly income.
Now of course, you're going to argue that even though you CAN buy private coverage in Brazil you don't have to.  But ask yourself why people opt for private coverage if they can get it for free.  Why would almost 1/3 of the people pay 10% of their income to have private coverage?  The answer is in the quality and accessibility to care.  
Do you know that even in Canada, if you need a procedure that isn't life threatening, such as perhaps having surgery to fix a non-debilitating muscle or joint problem you might have to wait YEARS to get it done, or you may be denied from having it done at all?  I can promise you things are not better in Brazil.  
Do you think this type of two-class healthcare system is something that would be acceptable in the United States?  Do you realize that his is where single payer always ends up?  Have you researched all the private and supplemental insurance plans that people buy in Canada and the UK?  Have you spoken to people from these countries about their difficulties getting access to care for procedures that the government deems "optional".  Do you want to allow the government to take over control of deciding which medical procedures you need are "optional"?

@_date: 2015-07-15 19:51:41
You're rambling off a list of incoherent and unrelated "facts" which you learned from reading sensationalized headlines on Reddit.  I would never argue that the system in the US is great and doesn't have its problems, but to make the claims you are demonstrates that you don't fully grasp the big picture.
First of all, any "insane regulation" that blocks competition is set forth by the US government, not the insurance companies.  I'm sure you read some headline about how lobbyists control government and therefore it's the insurance company lobbyists who are at fault.  But who is responsible for allowing a system that can be corrupted by lobbyists and corporate money?  That's right, politicians and by association, the voters who put them in office.  These companies are only doing what they're "supposed" to do.  Providing a service within the guidelines of laws and regulations while maximizing shareholder return.  It's tough to blame them for playing the game when they're following the rules.  It's the rules that are out of whack.
You cited Germany as a country with excellent "single payer" health coverage, which they do have.  How do you compare what it takes to effectively run this system in a country with 82 million people vs. a country with 45 million people just below the poverty line (350 million total)?  In Germany, it's estimated that .3% of the population is illegal immigrants.  In the United States it is almost 4%. Yes, that's more than 13x as many illegal immigrants by percentage of the population.  Yes, that's 246,000 people vs 14,000,000 people.  Germany's unemployment rate is 4.7% compared to our 5.5%.   Yes, that's 3,800,000 people compared to over 19,000,000 people.  Just those two groups of people who use the benefits and don't pay in account for well over half the entire population of Germany.
Your final statement not only has no basis in fact, but it shows little understanding of how private health insurance in the US even works.  Copays do not change. Deductibles do not change.  These are costs that are written plain as day in your policy and if they come into effect, they will need to be paid.  They are rarely values so high that you would "go broke" if you were forced to pay them.  People who go broke normally don't have any insurance, often times because they choose not to pay for it, and sometimes because they simply cannot.  I fully agree that we need to find a way to help the latter group.  Of course, the elderly have access to Medicare and the poor have access to Medicaid so we already do a lot to help these people.
People who need heart surgery are not "denied".  Since you said denied OR went broke, I take that to mean you do not consider them to be the same thing.  In which case, you don't get "denied" in the United States for anything if you have insurance, unless it's elective like a gender change or cosmetic surgery.  Your policy will clearly state that these things are not covered.  Your claim might get denied if you weren't covered for the procedure you have done and you could go broke, but you won't get denied.  Needing surgery on vital organs will be covered by all private insurance in the US.  I haven't heard of a single real-life story of someone who was covered by a private insurance plan in the US going broke because of heart surgery, or dieing because of being denied access.  If someone has a real, provable story, I would love to hear the details.

I didn't miss your point at all.  Did you read my post?  I said he's under the same illusion now as he was then if he thinks his extra dollars are going to help ensure that he's not denied coverage for something.  
The extra dollars he's paying are going to the people who require lots of care like people who have preexisting conditions and people who have avoided the doctor for 20 years because they didn't have insurance.  He's just as likely to get denied for "psychopathic reasons" now as he was before.  I'm not sure what's hard to understand about it.

I'm not saying your're wrong here but your perception is definitely a bit warped.  Do you think those drugs would cost $10 in Brazil if some American company hadn't done the research and development to test and create them, following the strict government regulations for testing that we have here in the US?  It costs tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars to bring a drug to market in the US.  Do you think they can recoup those costs selling prescriptions for $10?  The drugs wouldn't even exist, must less be offered for sale in Brazil.

It looks like depending on the exchange rate, 10k Bolivars is worth about $30 USD ($15-$50 range).  So 20x that would be $600 USD.  In otherwords, trading at a 40% premium to USD there.  Of course, this is from 4 months ago so their currency may have collapsed even further since then. (

@_date: 2016-02-29 17:06:24
I find this kind of interesting, due to this math:
200k Bolivars = 20x minimum wage
US minimum wage = $7.25
20x US min age = $145
.4 BTC @ $400 USD = $160
In other words, .4 BTC is worth pretty close to around 20x minimum wage, both in the US and apparently in Venezuela as well.  Perhaps with a slight premium in Venezuela due to the scarcity.  Free markets ftw!

Glad some people are starting to share my opinion on this matter, as I got downvoted for expressing the same opinion just the other day.  Obviously this use case doesn't give Bitcoin purists a warm fuzzy, but there are positive things that can come of it and the fact is the code is open source.  Anyone can use it for whatever they want and most likely innovations will come of it.
Decentralization is just 1 of the many, many advantages of using a blockchain.  Automated consensus and transaction verification, security, scalabilty, and auditability are just some of them.  Also, decentralization itself has additional benefits, other than not having to trust an opaque third party.  Anyone who is responsible for database backups of databases as large and important as we're talking here about can attest to that, and don't even get me started on restoring that data.  Could banks have used a shared database in the past?  Sure.  Would it have offered the same performance and features as using a blockchain? Absolutely not.

@_date: 2015-09-10 19:37:16
When you develop software, sometimes the way it is used when it reaches the real world is not exactly the same as what was originally intended.  Besides, Satoshi clearly stated in the white paper that you had to use unique addresses to send and receive for every transaction in order to maintain privacy, and that for some multi-input transactions, it would be impossible to prevent the various keys from being tied to a single person.  In my opinion, he is clearly stating here that bitcoin transactions are not necessarily completely anonymous or private.


from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input
transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk
is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.
I would also like to point out that in his conclusion, in which Satoshi summarizes the Bitcoin protocol and the blockchain, he doesn't mention anything about privacy or anonymity.  It is for these reasons that I continue to state that privacy was only an arbitrary by-product of the blockchain, and doesn't really have anything to do with the intended purpose of the system


the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:33:35
I disagree.  They're sacrificing a slight bit of performance for the benefit of remaining in control.  They won't need settlement measured in minutes necessarily and the stakeholders only need to trust that their private blockchain wasn't subject to some 51% attack, instead of needing to trust any of the other parties.  For example, a consortium of 50 banks could band together on a common private blockchain, each run 20 full nodes in data centers across the world, and do away with clearing houses.  Each miner would need to have a specific license key and/or IP address to connect to the network. They also get the added benefits of system wide auditability, automated transaction recording and settlement, decentralized data storage and high level encryption.

The comment I replied to said that all the Wall Street blockchain implementors would move to Bitcoin to prevent a 51% attack.

I don't understand how you can just flat out say "no, there is no such thing" when nobody even knows what they're going to do.

Why do you need them to post an excuse for you if, as you put it, they have "shown its word means nothing"?  The reason why they put in a limit is pretty obvious.  They just lost $2m, their investors are upset with their stupidity, and the board decided they needed to make this change to reassure their investors.  You're not locked into any agreement with them.  Stripe has .5% fees on Bitcoin payments and a more robust API.  Just switch to them for your needs if it upsets you that much.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:55:06
There are a heck of a lot of uses for a service like this besides just spying on you for spending $30 at Overstock.  What about private blockchains?  What about private analytical use?  The "whole idea" of Bitcoin is not to prevent "your competitors, customers, employers or landlords" from seeing the transactions you make.  That was just an unintended consequence of early Bitcoin use, but it has nothing to do with the purpose of the blockchain (at least not with Bitcoin).  
In fact, it would be fairly easy to argue that the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is the opposite of that.  I think this was proven by how easily things are tracked down like the theft of Bitcoin by DEA agents during the Silk Road investigation, and the subsequent discovery and capture of the thieves.... using just blockchain data.  Did those events not make you realize that you're not as anonymous as you think?
In the future, people will just use a different digital asset if privacy is a primary concern.  Maybe we'll all use a different digital asset in the future, who knows.  The whole point of the endless discovery, innovation, and investment in blockchain technology right now is to try and determine what kinds of ways this technology can be applied.  I applaud anyone who is thinking outside the box and doing the hard work and discovery necessary to help form the basis for the future of digital currencies and applications for the blockchain.

It is not a pain in the ass at all.  Coinigy has taken in thousands of dollars in Bitcoin payments in the past couple of months and we auto-convert a share of it to USD which is deposited into our bank account within a day or two automatically using Bitpay.  It is the fastest way our customers have to check out (much faster than Paypal) and the money is in our account fast with little or no fee.   There may be reasons not to accept Bitcoin but fiat settlement is not one of them.
EDIT: typo

Unforeseen circumstances?  My point is if it can, who can say unequivocally that they won't ever do it?

I deposited a check last week Saturday and they told me it would clear on January 7th

No ejaculation involved. It's Skee-Ball.

Not really true in developed nations.  If you're a criminal or the money is "dirty" then sure, but otherwise, no.

Fair point

I don't know, that's why they call them unforeseen circumstances.

I went to the site. It says it's under maintenance for the next couple days.... classic.

I don't see how anyone can say that this is cut-and-dry truth for all of time. The Bitcoin development team could easily change it and if it was adopted by the majority of miners than the cap would be removed or changed.  Am I missing something?
EDIT: I meant full nodes not miners.
