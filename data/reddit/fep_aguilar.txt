No matter what happens. We are early adopters despite any fact. Hold until December 2020 at least.

October has not finished yet
@_date: 2019-10-21 06:18:02
Just HOLD. Let’s talk about it again in the next 3 years from now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:28:50
Don’t worry. You are buying the bottom of the future. Hold and sell in Dec 2020

Basically he wanted to change his lifestyle and it was possible thanks to Bitcoin. 
Even though he lost 400k USD or so when the bullish BTC market ends after December 2017, he was able to keep moving forward with his strategy and today he lives along with his family under a BTC economy strategy. IMHO that’s something interesting to do.

Bitcoin everyday seems to be more trustable and legit for no geeks folks out there, in that behalf, there are more people aware about what’s going on in the BTC ecosystem, even more than December 2017. It represents a solid position in what BTC going to represent in the next 5-8 years. Long story short: Buy and Hold.

He’s a genius and an old man. The nature is to step away from whatever any abstract topic related to technology. 
So Warren only see this as an asset, but he still does not understand the big impact it might have regarding human-kind in the future, that’s why he mentions “Bitcoin does not make sense, is only a number”, he does not understand all the things around blockchain.

It seems to be trash marketing mostly. Come on people.
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:08:22
I’m sure we have a pioneer here.

You can’t compare any altcoin with Bitcoin itself. But that’s another story, anyway, the big picture in here is only a story about a family that make their own decisions about what to do with their own money and for them is working. That’s it.

What 21 million club are you talking about dude? (?)
@_date: 2019-05-05 06:42:52
Both US and Rusia talking about Bitcoin in this kind of level, is a good indicator in how much BTC has been stablished as a high fidelity asset...

There you have people around the world. This Uber driver will be rich by 2020. HOLD!
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:24:55
Exactly, that’s the point

When I see somebody pushing hard about any specific topic the only thing that comes to my mid is: This is getting success.
 I mean, when I see someone like Warren Buffett for example talking shit regarding cryptos this is only because they don’t understand what’s going on all about it, they still live in the past century.
So long story short: Anybody pushing back for the BTC movement, is only because either they are afraid about it or they don’t have any clue about the idea behind blockchain.

Yes. So in the moment he and his family are happy with their lifestyle and decisions, it becomes into a win situation immediately. Kudos BTC!
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:15:56
Great things are barely starting to happen folks. Be prepared, HODL!
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:13:03
Just wait a couple minutes to get the price in 8k, then you can go and sleep.
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:43:53
Long-story short: Kudos BTC. Hold.

For gods sake
