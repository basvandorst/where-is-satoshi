Why not Digital Bitbox?

Copied form another post:
*Note: I haven't had a Ledger or Trezor. I made my purchase after some research on the internet about the hardware wallets, and choose to buy the Digital Bitbox. *
I like the fact that it uses a dedicated desktop app instead of a browser extension. I have been told that the app is being rewritten from ground up to make it better and more flexible, allowing for more currencies, and will be released by the end of first quarter 2018
It's a tiny, sleek and very robust device made with high quality materials.
When you create a new wallet or load an existing one (as the device can only have one single wallet at a time), you have to insert the SD card (or any micro SD card). At first I thought it has to be always inserted, but it's not the case. 
The SD card simply stores a PDF for each wallet, and this PDF can be copied to make as many backups as you want (home NAS, CD, other SD-Card)
You don't have to write down a 12/24 random word list. A "normal" password for the wallet and another for the decide itself is all you need.
With the PDF and the password you set, you can obtain the private keys in case you lose the Digital Bitbox, and you can make this with offline computer as the HTML file to generate the Keys is available in Github for this purpose.

I don’t understand what do you mean in the first point... ��
Even if there are no vowels, there are more than 26-5=21 number-date combinations, so the same letter (incl. vowels) is represented with different date-number combo (*if* each date-number represents one and only one letter)
And APOLOGY is not a word of the big cipher, isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:31:25
I like the Digital Bitbox
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:11
Does Bitcoin has been born in the USA?
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:30:59
APOLOGY is the 12th word of the Beta-Game-Cipher (which isn't actually part of it and it isn't actually ciphered at all) it doesn't necessary has to be also the 12th word for this "Big-Price" Game-Chiper.
I didnt't say the same number-date serie represents different letters, I mean different number-date series can represent the same letter (it is the opposite you see)
The first 1-2 digit numbers of each series, cannot be the number of the word, as there are too manys 1's and 2's and way too many 10's, 11's and so on... there is even a 13 and a 14!

Why you say it is the least? Why is not the 7th one the last? ��
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:29:21
I wonder if there might be another hint next Wednesday?
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:42:56
* Are the number series unsorted?
* Are there fake numbers?
* Do each series represent one letter? with or without spaces?
* Is there only one layer of encryption?
* Are the words whole words or only i.e. the first 4 letters?
* Is all the information self contained or are external resources necessary?
so many questions...
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:49:51
Why you say that? What was your idea?

@_date: 2018-10-31 05:57:55
I wonder how complex your ‘solution’ is because I have been trying since August different levels of complexity and combinations (mainly sums and rests of the number-date pairs, but also tried binary and even difference between two number-date combos) and for the love of god I can’t even get **one** word, let alone 12 to try to open the wallet...
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:04:33


Neither do I. If I knew that I wouldn’t waste so many hours of my life. It is not funny at all. 
(I didn’t care for the Bitcoins but the intellectual game)

Yeah, my thoughts and experience as well
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:11:23
The thing is that you can manipulate the numbers as you want and obtain the combination you need. There are so many numbers to choose from that you’ll be able to find *some* logical way for the one word, but obviously won’t work for the rest of the words. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:59:17
Huh? Did you get **A** from **step**??

I was for way longer but I truly believed that was self contained.

The value is what two agree to be, if you repair my car and we agree that I will pay you one gallon of water, then yes, it is a currency (for us), but not a "legal" or "recognized" one universally. 
Venezuelan Bolívar is not a world wide currency as Bitcoin is trying to be. The Bolívar has problems because the country that it is using it, has problems. How can it be extrapolated to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:05:17
To 0 what? $0? Currencies doesn't have value because its relative value in another currency. Is a dollar less worth for you because it went down in relation to the euro, for example? Or you can still buying the same coffee beans as yesterday in your local store?
A good currency is a one you can use to trade, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:39:59

You can blackout the balance, Bank account number and all the itemized transactions. They only need your name + address and a Date 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:10
It is a simple app, easy to understand and multiplatform (Win, Linux and OSX)
It has multi sign, so more people have to approve an outgoing  transaction if you wish (as an enhanced security, i.e. your not so savvy parents)
I choose it because you can select the exact fee (and see how much it is in Bitcoins and its equivalency $ or €) before you confirm the transaction.
