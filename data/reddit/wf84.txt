Buying a house is not by default cheaper than payng a rent all hour life. It depends on where you live, the taxes, the prices and many many other things..

If ppl took profits then the price would fall gradually. So u didnt figure out anything

Never short Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:06:17
Respect for this guy who stands by his beliefs. I think that's what counts especially in times like those now, to know why on the first place you came for cryptocurrency. Was it for the quick money, for the everyday trading, for the idea of decentralization, for your political beliefs or because you feel this is going somewhere and you didn't want to miss? I think it is all fine and we need all those people for a market to function. But at a bear market the people who stand by their beliefs and who are visionary will be the ones, who will eventually be successful. I personally got involved in Bitcoin because I believe that it will be the only sound money in the future. For me the 20000 dollar bitcoin was not a good deal so i didnt sell. Now i just buy as much as I can. When i will sell I can't say. It depends on many things. Maybe one day i will not need to sell, because Fiat money may not exist then.

Still congratulation for your investment! 95% of the population owns no Bitcoin! You are one of the few smart people owning it. Welcome in the elite club. Now just HODl and dont even think of selling at a loss.

Well u were lucky. I personally would never take a risk like this, because u never know if it is not a bear trap.

Or...you sell your house and with the money u get for it  plus the 150 k you buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:30:19
You just forgot to say that 
1. most people dont have 100 years to wait
2. Gold rose at least 400 percent only in 10 years. So your numbers are false
3. S&amp;P was started in 1923, so i guess it is not 100 years old yet.
3. We dont know how bitcoin would do for 100 years so that we can compare it to S&amp;P. But for the last ten years the increase is something we have never seen before and then it certainly overdid the rise of S&amp;P during its whole history
So what were you saying?
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:23:04
Dont sell. If you sell then that's it, the money is gone. If u hold, the chance of a bounce is actually high. Crypto is by no means dead, even if new lows come. This is part of the crypto market. And by the way my portfolio looks much worse than yours.

Those are exactly my thoughts too. Bitcoin is always with you wherever you go and still it is invisible for anybody else.

@_date: 2018-09-10 08:13:14
Yes of course people are buying. But I personally do not buy bitcoin which costs over 10000 USD. For me 6-8 k is a great price. Above that i consider too expensive. But who knows if Bitcoin gets to 50k and falls down to 20k then i will change my mind and consider 20k a great price.

Guys dont worry. Bitcoin needs a hard crash and be officially pronounced dead. Only then can it resurrect and go to new highs. It has always been like that and it will be like that now as well.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:34:44
Market Manipulation was not taken into account. I know i was wrong
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:15:38
What some people haven't understood is that we live in the year 2018. You cannnot compare the  internet economy with holes on the streets. A few years ago WhatsApp was sold to Facebook for 14 Billion euro. If bitcoin is worthless then so should  WhatsApp be. It's also virtual and nothing more than lines of code. The biggest Companies nowadays are Google, Facebook and so on... this is the new economy. And Bitcoin belongs to it. I remember in the early 2000 when Amazon was compared to Wal Mart and people were saying that it will never be as successful.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:32:18

A dump of 1 bln bitcoin has surely a short term devastating effect. But in the long term the times have never been better for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:37:21
Yes u are right. This is a problem. But if we manage to get price higher and get institutional investors involved then those manipulations will not happen to such an extent. 
But i think something else. Manipulators dont want to kill their business by crashing BTC to 0 dollars because there will be nothing left to manipulate. So they are also interested in pumping up the price at some point.  And that means we shall not sell during times like that, we should not allow ourselves get manipulated. One should wait and sell higher only.
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:13:04
Oh i think thats me
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:47:29
Then sell your BTC and buy the created from thin air currency of a massively indebted country. Wish you success!
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:17:38
Now it is already 3%
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:35:56
I dont think that is the reason. It is just a manipulation. Nobody cares so much about Goldman
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:28:30
Governments cannot regulate Bitcoin because bitcoin is an independent network .
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:52:31
Could be. But this also shows how important it is not to panic during times like those and not sell. The future of Bitcoin has never been brighter. The West is heavily in debt, some of the developing countries are going bankrupt, the price of Bitcoin is already 24K in Iran. You can all imagine what role Bitcoin can play in the future. Not selling in a bear market is crucial, HODL.
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:19:17
If they accept bitcoin we are all gonna witness a magical transformation from a bear into a bull.

Lets shake off some weak hands. This game is for tough guys like me 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:36:25
I completely agree with you. This is all manipulation. This is no news that can cause such a dump. Do you remember last time ETF was rejected? The market didnt react to it at all. People just HODL and forget bitcoin for a month or two.
@_date: 2018-09-10 08:07:45
Im also buying every month. We have been already 9 months in a bear market. We dont have so much time left to accumulate. Once the next bull market starts i stop buying.
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:59:29
Thats why the do anything possible to stop bitcoin. Their whole business model will be busted.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:44:37
I dont know. When the sentiment is bearish things can go longer and lower than one thinks. In a bad case scenario we could be moving in 4-5-6 k zone for a year or a bit longer. Still i do think next year the sentiment will turn bullish. But i am still surprised that bitcoin has held for so long in the bear market and has dropped only to 6 k. I would say this is the most bullish news up to date.
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:13:03
I would love to buy bitcoin at 3 digits. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:18:28
Well said! I am staying. The price of my BTC is over 100k. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:59:31
IPhone? People still buy that?
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:59:50
Im sure they did
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:20:36
Ive done a research thats why i am saying that. The fixed costs u pay, where i live, are at least 10 percent of the price. On top come the prices of houses went up so much that rent is simply cheaper. The money that u have left not paying a mortgage per month can be invested in something else which brings you more profit. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:08:11
I don't think we are going lower. I think we are in the beginning of a bull market.

Goldman Sachs is a synonym for decent, honest hard working people, who are interested in making the world a better place. Their only goal is to reduce poverty around the world. It is an absolute non profit organisation. We should thank god for sending us Goldman Sachs. Real angels on Earth. There should be Goldman Sachs prize, which will be just as respected as the noble price for peace. Thank you Goldman Sachs! We love you Goldman Sachs!

@_date: 2018-09-06 20:54:19
And most of them say its a bubble and when u ask why the think so they say because the prices are falling. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:04:30
I dont spend my precious bitcoin on S**T like that.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:20:45
The market was going steadily up at a healthy slow pace. Then in 30 mins it fell like a stone 400 dollars and then 600 dollars more. And you are claiming this happened because investors decided to book profits? Do you really think if that were the case, that the fall would be so huge and most of all so fast?? I think a few people sold a bunch of bitcoins together in a coordinated manner. Nevertheless bitcoin is stronger and will overcome that too. Once we are in a trillion dollar market those dumps will stop.
@_date: 2018-09-08 12:17:33
I am also waiting for that
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:34:34
Why sell when price goes down? What u say makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:02:04
Well definitely not FIAT.
@_date: 2018-09-10 10:06:15
You are right. It could last some more years. Nobody knows. But 9 months is in crypto very long time.
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:07:28
The trend for Bitcoin for the last 10 years has been extremely bullish. There is no reason to believe this is going to change in the future. Bears are in control from time to time but it is temporarily. There is no market which is all the time bullish. Thats why if you are not a professional trader. Just HODL
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:36:33
Buying doesn't cause a crash. Selling does
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:10:02
Bitcoin should fall down to 4 - 5k so that a new bull run is possible.
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:22:38
Its not Bitcoins problem that u have to buy it on exchanges which charge taxes. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:31:50
Well with a gun in your hand u can theoretically rob a whole bank. So it is not about getting something by using violence
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:40:24
Totally agree. There should be someone like you who shows us the big picture. Everyone HODl strong!
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:38:21
It can but historically a bull run starts only after bitcoin has been pronounced dead and most of the people sell in panic and lose faith in it. The fact that we are holding 6k level shows either there is too much faith left on Bitcoin and Bitcoin is still alive which makes a bull run unlikely. Or it could be that we have hit rock bottom which i personally dont believe
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:01:29
There are many projects in this area but none of them comes even close to Bitcoin. There is no reason to believe in a great blockchain future without bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:33:49
Could it be, that it has something to do with the billion dollar bitcoin movements about which we have been reading recently?

Or maybe sell on the high. You never know
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:37:48
Because it is one of the greatest inventions that mankind has ever made in its whole existence - the creation of truly decentralized deflationary money. Shorting Bitcoin is stupid, risky and short sighted and will most likely end in a disaster especially for the less experienced traders. Buy and let it rest for one two years or longer.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:38:47
Remember you only lose if you sell. Seeing how viotile the price has been for the last years nobody knows, how much Bitcoin is going to be be in a few months. We can still reach 20 K till the end of the year. Don't forget that's Bitcoin, anything is possible. Who is panic selling now will regret it eventually. I have lost 12k till now and If it gets cheaper than 5k ill buy more. My Bitcoins stay with me!!

@_date: 2018-11-22 14:45:51
My greed is here absolutely irrelevant. I don't see any contradiction on my assumption. The more bitcoin is used the more people will buy it and the more expensive it will get. Then the bigger the market cap, the less the volatility. Our market cap is nowadays of a tiny size, even in December 2017. On a small market, the assets can be easily volatile. If bitcoin had a market cap of  $10 trillion today, then it would be much more stable in terms of price. It is as simple as that. Got it?

You only lose if u sell. If you are down you have not lost. This is only temporarily.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:59:03
I dont sell because if i start selling when the price falls, then i have to start trading. As a working person i have no time for this, so i just HODl. Moreover u never know when it will go back up.

Well when i got into bitcoin i knew it is extremely volatile and i knew it could happen that i get like -90 %. It is part of the game. Today bitcoin is dead tomorrow it may be a hype again. But i do believe in the future of BTC so for me is also business as usual. Look at the stock markets, they are getting ready for a crash too.

@_date: 2018-11-20 21:51:11
Well I invested in bitcoin and im deep in the red zone right now. Anyways it doesnt matter to me, because all I want right now is that Bitcoin falls another 50% so that i can buy as much as possible. ��
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:23:37
I bought back in 2002 but I also forgot where I put it. It must be worth a fortune now.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:50:42
When I see so many bitcoin death memes, then it makes me think the bull run is just around the corner. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:38:28
Everybody knows it is volatile because bitcoin is in its early years. There will come a time it will be as volatile as gold but then its price wont be $4000 any more.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:57:04
Oh dont bother us with your Sh** please
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:07:34
Most people here think long term is around 6 Months.
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:18:35
HODL and BUY
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:50:48
Have you ever heard of the word inflation? Your fiat money lose value every year.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:29:19
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:00:36
I am already at hope

Please turn to Subredit rShitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:55:49
Just another loser you are. You only havent realised it yet. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:09:38
The market is in its earliest stages. Institutional investors are about to get in. So I do believe in BTC brightest future
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:08:15
We are going downwards once again so sit back and relax. The ride will be a bit bumpy.
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:42:01
The same is happening now too. People cannot imagine it will one day reach 100k. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:39:34
People dont panic. There has always been a dump before a bull run. It is good we broke the 6000 level. The next step is a gradual recovery and then comes the bull run. This is going perfect!
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:58:56
I dont know but then thats the risk
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:02:55
Deutsche Bank is almost bankrupt
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:48:22
Haha. At some point it will hit rock bottom
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:54:29
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:40:08
Then sell us your bitcoins please.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:04:42
Why would u leave your job? You thought u will earn your money with crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:46:33
Same here. I am only curious how low it will go.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:25:56
Ok maybe i am the only true holder left in this world. I dont know, maybe i am stupid but one thing i know. I AM NOT SELLING. Bitcoin can go to $1, if it needs to. That will not scare me.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:22:38
You are right i havent seen it with my eyes. But I know ETP Switzerland, Bakt, some american Universities , those are the ones i have heard of.
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:22:46
I guess people are searching "bitcoin dead"
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:39:48
I also went through the December hype but I didnt sell. I am a long term Hodler. You made your money, its good for you. Forget bitcoin and live your life. What are you doing here?
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:34:26
I think 20 k is a very pessimistic guess. 99% of the people havent realised yet what bitcoin really is even after 10 years. Friends of mine who are mostly highly educated people say they would never buy bitcoin. Thats because they have no idea, but i also dont wanna explain to them. Bitcoin is the most sound money we are going to have ever. I have no doubt it will eventually reach $1 million.
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:53:52
Its good to see what people were talking about back then. It was basically the same situation as now. The ones who HODLED and bought more were the winners. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:32:30
Sure because you sold.
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:38:39
But not interested in girls?
Anyways i need a business shirt like that.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:16:20
Oh I'm really like that right now ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:30:22
It's falling because it is not rising right now.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:31:53
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:01:59
I would say 85%
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:17:57
I am almost always right check my posts!
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:01:38
I agree with most of the video, apart from the parts where they claim you have to suffer and work hard. I think one should just live his life happily
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:08:24
Did we already reach 20k??
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:43:46
Well I understand but it was not me who posted the above.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:43:31
Bitcoin year-end will be between 50k and 100k.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:14:11
And me
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:00:58
Definitely yes
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:01:41
I see end of 2020 around 500k. I don't think it will go to a million. Then it will crash to around 35k.
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:56:03
2,9 k.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:10:23
HODL and buy more if you can afford. Selling at those prices is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:35:00
Very well said
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:15:26
But but this is not a lambo..
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:04:37
I say till the end of of this year new ATH. Next year bitcoin will rise above 100k
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:28:21
I said 6000. Never ever. That was it!
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:58:04
100 k
