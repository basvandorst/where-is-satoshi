And with the upward trend in value (especially lately), you stand a reasonable chance of making that 10% back pretty easily. And on that optimistic note, perhaps even more at this point as an early-adopting business since I'm sure most (if not all) of your vendors and operating costs are pinned to USD. Of course the downside to that is pretty clear too, but not quite as convincing.
Platform looks pretty awesome by the way. Bonus points for not even linking to it.

Dear Virgin America and/or i-5 gas stations,
Please accept my BTC. 
Thanks in advance.

Brilliant. I'll save the scrutiny for feedback emails and simply say, yes. One thousand times, yes. 
An important question to me though: Do you have any plans, even on a distant roadmap, to add additional crypto pairs? At .5% (wait, really?), your rake from me alone would be sizable. Plus, XRP is... unfortunate. 
Your platform and UI clearly outclass that of BTC-e and Vircurex, and although I can see how some of your big features - e.g. leverage - may be interesting to implement, the volume of trades you'd attract could potentially put your dev ROI in 'holy shit!' territory.

A card, using existing hardware and established public comfort would lower the adoption bar on both ends considerably.

Currently on Btc-e, there are ~700k LTC in sell orders, and &lt;2k in buys. Though some disagree, I am 100% behind the idea of alternative currencies theoretically, and while I'd also enjoy profiting from it, I'm not sure if this peak is very sustainable. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:06:56
Although you're based in the UK, I think this will still work in the US, but I'm not 100% sure... Can you confirm?

Of course. Something like what you've suggested could work, but I'll bet there's someone around here that could work out a more exciting solution.

This is awesome. I especially enjoy seeing adoption by small businesses like these.

I understand this was downvoted because it seems trolly at a glance, but this is a very very legitimate concern. The benefit of a hybrid is client-side storage of private keys, with a unique server-side identifier to pair it with. This is a bigger gap than the old (pre-hybrid) ewallets left open. 
They have plenty of technology available, with much of it being open source. Very frustrating. 
Concerned future citizens possibly reading this: see  for a better implementation.

I hate to be a negative Nancy, but I am genuinely over the whole "Bitcoin vs. government, man" thing. It feels more counterproductive every time I hear it. 
Bitcoin is not a conflicting idea for the sake of being a conflicting idea. This just happens to fit OP's followers' interests, and consequently, his personal investment's interest.

I would recommend re-submitting this link while it's still new, since editing the title is not allowed. 
Side-note: This made me imagine a time where rather than posting newly adopting vendors, we had to keep tabs on those who *didn't* accept bitcoin.

Awesome. Do you have any plans to add more bet types in the future? I'd be more interested in betting on podiums, retirements, and things like individual team/driver vs. team/driver (by gap or just win/lose).

What an incredibly interesting conversation. In terms of idea value, I'd trade all the TED content I've ever seen for more exchanges like this. 
Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:40:43
Well I'll be damned. I just sold off most of my position after a stale couple months for more action in the altcoin market.  
Edit: It looks like my profits so far from scalping are still way better than if I were to sell my asicminer shares today, so I'm still happy.

As soon as (or before) a major merchant accepts bitcoin directly or through their own gateway, a reliable way to tax it will be realized.

I really enjoy the idea that something like Silk Road can exist, but it's kind of bumming me out how often it comes up in non-political articles about bitcoin. Of course it's inherently notable, with their impressive transaction volumes, but there's no one who would argue that they move more illicit merchandise than the open-air markets using USD... 
I guess it's probably tempting for the authors though; they'll probably get a few hundred extra shares/links based on the "oh my" factor. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:42:21
Such a good question. I'd imagine at this point it, the answer is no, since it hasn't really come up yet, and there aren't many precedents in the wild west. I'm also really curious about how this is enforced. I would bet that the arbitrage opportunities here are sizable. 
Does Coinlab have an official/legal position on this? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:32:09
Off-topic but mildly interesting: With the exception of your operating system, it seems we have a lot in common.
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:41:00
Yeah, I love this idea, but skepticism should always lead excitement with stuff like this. All it takes is one speck of greed to spoil a good idea. 
That said, OP: Wishing you the best of luck! This could be really great.

I wouldn't even call $1 "only". Cheers to you, humble bitcoiner, I hope you are able to recover it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:08:01
Ha! As a developer with a budding small business, I know both holy shit zones well, and don't get me started on legal. 
RE additional coins: That's great to hear. I'm really looking forward to watching this thing grow. Keep your iterations tight and ship ship ship. The entire Bitcoin economy has been begging for better exchange options, and at least from beta distance, Kraken looks like a knight in shining armor. 
By the way, solid name. You'll stand out against the usual Bitxx, Coinxx, etc., and even more for spending a few more minutes than the default Bootstrap styles on your landing page. Best of luck to you.

Awesome. The controversy around this is petty, and I'm glad to see it moving forward. 
I will say however, this poor guy may also want to invest in public speaking course or two. Those nerves are contagious.

Since my initial BTC deposit last month, I (was) up ~450%, simply by hustling on the dissemination of (mis)information in the BTC-e trollbox. It would have been one thing to regress from bad decisions, but it *really* sucks to lose so much to something out of my control. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 23:08:49
Haha, so true, but it's beautiful. This thing is like the Goldwing of scooters!
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:58:58
I can't speak for this specifically, but philosophically... While risks such as this will come and go -- especially in the push from early adoption to public knowledge -- one thing for sure is that Bitcoin has a uniquely passionate base of support; especially with the technically minded. What I mean is that up to a certain point of adoption where consumers use it as cash carefree, the growth of social "skin in the game" rises at a similar rate. Due to its open-source and decentralized nature, growth in participation will probably (hopefully) continue to expand the watchdog umbrella. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:53:36
I'm not arguing that it's any more challenging to account for. That much is clear. What I mean is that when we reach a point -- say for example, with wide commercial adoption like this -- where BTC is affecting the global economy tangibly enough to merit a standard level of involvement from the IRS/SEC/HMRC/etc., a reliable way to prove legitimacy is something to think about.
I'm not an economist, and I'm completely on your side here, but fiat-based regulations and tax codes might not pair perfectly with bitcoin's advantages at such a scale yet. While it most definitely works for our growing economy right now, I'm thinking hypothetically about the impact a major adoption would have before the authorities could wrangle in some specific rules. 
But honestly, either way, it's exciting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:41:40

@_date: 2013-04-14 02:09:13
I like the broader business idea here, and I wish you well. I know you're just trying to begin testing the market, and this is almost always a good idea when you're prototyping, but in my opinion, marketing to the bitcoin (dev) community is going to be different.
* Your potential clientele is highly technical, security skeptical, and if motivated, can probably have a working beta up sooner, and with a more rational ROI than your .75-1% (per transaction!) fee.
* If your plan is legit, execute it. At least a demo using testnet. Document it thoroughly, and write some official whitepapers. You'll probably get a few email addresses now, but with these things alone you'll get many times the interest -- still pre-release. A landing page here is simply not going to perform as well as it would for say a new iOS app.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:43:22
I agree. Maybe it's because I don't have any stake in it so there's no emotional edge to my opinion, but I'm not seeing why this isn't a positive thing for everyone. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:07:23

OP (on bitcointalk) reminds me of why I stopped investing so much time in [popular] open source projects. Users become accustomed to a free product, and the cost of development (time + experience + resources) has no value to them. It's simply infuriating. 
When a paying client *demands* changes from me, I will happily oblige. When a user of an open-source/free product *demands* changes... Hell no, son. You can contribute, or you can take your all-caps, bold feature ~~requests~~ demands somewhere else.

I can vouch for some light suckage in its first few versions (circa ~2011), but the team behind it is super sharp, and in my opinion, has raised the bar for WP-as-a-CMS utilities. I wouldn't replace my Drupal setups with it, but I do use it on occasion for small/niche shops -- with confidence. 
Either way, I like the idea of this plugin, for merchants looking to hang on to their Bitcoin (as opposed to Bitpay).
