I withdrew my BTC from Gemini using a Segwit address to my wallet.

I bought in at the beginning of December and have bought even more later on. This dip is pretty crazy but I bought with the intention of holding for a couple of years and I will stick to it. I have faith in crypto and shall just ride it out. A

I just bought some LTC off of GDAX and I tried to transfer it over to my ledger Nano s but it said the address is unavailable. My ledger wallet was set on the Segwit block chain. Do I need to change it to the legacy block chain in order to withdraw from GDAX?

Anyone use Bitfinex for buying coin? I'm looking to buy some different alt coins and it seems to have a lot of options. I made an account with Gdax to buy some LTC but I've been waiting almost 2 weeks for my bank transfer to go through. Was wondering if Bitfinex is a good exchange?

You keep talking about airdrops and I am just thinking of a plane dropping off a crate of coins. Can you please elaborate on what you mean by airdrop?

What does everyone think of Bitfinex as an exchange? Im looking to buy some different alt coins and they have a big selection. GDAX is taking forever for my funds to transfer.

I've been using Gemini. Haven't had any problems with them so far. Transactions have been fast and accurate. They also have low fees. To verify your bank you may have to wire some money though.

Thing is you have to do a wire transfer to verify an account. After that you can do $500 Bank transfer daily. Also wouldn't recommend holding coin on exchanges unless you are planning to trade.

I'm not sure. I know it's insured in some form. They are based in New York. Check out their site it tells you.

I recommend Gemini.
