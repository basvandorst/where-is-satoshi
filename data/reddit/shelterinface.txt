Does binance still let you get around US taxes? When they were in china, you could trade all you wanted and only when transferring back to coinbase would you have to report a single transaction to the IRS.

Ideally they are insured in case the physical asset is destroyed somehow.  If not, I wouldn't even consider it.  You cannot trust a fund that cannot back the value if their cold wallet is somehow lost.  Whether that loss is via theft or act of god.

That is not how it works on an exchange.  Tether must be printed and bought back to manage the supply against demand to keep its value at 1usd.  Being backed by 1 dollar doesn't mean anything unless you can easily swap your tether for a dollar and even then the exchanges would have to lock the price at 1 dollar.  I doubt any exchange is going to do that if a 3rd party that cannot be completely trusted is holding the USD.
By making the owners of tether managed supply, it keeps them honest.  The second they decide to fuck with tether, it will show immediately.  It won't rely on having people denied a swap of tether for usd.  You cannot currently swap tether to usd via tether.

It would be a shit show having them tie github's enterprise services to apple server hardware.  The worst Microsoft can do is bundle github with azure stack and if the price isn't crazy, it really wouldn't matter much. Github enterprise is already pricey as is, if microsoft offered to bundled github licenses with visual studio and azure stack that would probably save some companies money.
Plus all the people paying for private githubs are now also paying for azure cloud hosting without paying a dime more or seeing anything change.  Microsoft will migrate github over to their hosting.  That alone could reduce github's costs and help preserve the free product.  Hell, I would bet we see additional web hosting options and cloud storage options sold via github all using azure that are all integrated into github.
This is a great product for microsoft, only if they don't ruin it in some way.  They can leverage github to advertise all their other services and bundle.  They can increase git integration in their own products and see an return on investment via github instead of helping someone else profit on the effort.
If they ruin github, they get a dead website and nothing for their money.

You are just ignoring the issue by trying to bottle it up as "risk tolerance".  A currency isn't supposed to have a risk tolerance.  If you start talking about risk tolerance when it comes to a currency, that currency is too unstable to be used as a currency.  Look at venezuela.

Its hard to use bitcoin as a value store or currency if the price fluctuates so much.  Going up is good for value store, but the high fees make it impossible to use as a currency.  Going down makes it terrible for both a value store and currency.
It needs to be more stable and needs softer inflation or deflation for people to trust it as a currency and a long term value store.

Your title makes no sense.  This has nothing to do with youtube.
Stripe won't support businesses that deal in crypto or crypto related services.  They gave him an alternative to use, he should just switch to it and be done with it.
They even gave justiifcation by saying crypto is an area with high chargebacks.  Plus lets be honest, this guy seems to be selling stupid youtube videos that just list free public info.

If tether only buys and sells to manage supply, you can't just hand them your tether and get money.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:10:45
It will collapse if the tax avoidance benefits go away because exchanges start carrying USD and reporting to the IRS or an alternative to tether pops up that is deemed less risky.
You would never use tether on gdax becuase you can just swap in and out of usd and if you used tether, it would still be reported to the IRS.  But you would use tether on binance which doesn't carry USD and doesn't report to the IRS.

The term value is not ambiguous.  If you are anti-fiat, you obviously aren't dealing in forex or any currency anyways.
Value for a currency is based on what you can buy with it.  Forex deals in currencies that are relied on by economies and have fairly stable values.(extremely stable when compared to bitcoin)
Bitcoin can completely lose 100% of its value overnight.  No one is using it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:23:23
Exchanges could just lock it at 1 dollar.  But without tether itself buying back tether in a lull, there won't be buyers.  People will read that tether is worth 1 usd, but there would be no buyers.  It will be worthless.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:14:43
Correct, that is how they can buy it all back.
But the supply still must be actively managed per exchange to keep it at the value of 1 dollar.
If demand falls, they must buy back tether to keep it trading at 1usd.  If demand goes up, they must print tether.
Only if the tether is backed by usd can they afford to buy it back as needed.  That is why backing it with usd is very important.
But even if they truly have it all backed by usd, you think they aren't just going to hit a threshold and bail?  If tether is going to die and not make them money, they are going to abandon it and keep the money they have.

Ewww!  I prefer instagramcoin®.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:31:41
You saying its not in there interest to buy it back?  That would just cause tether's value to drop.  If it deviates too far away from 1 usd in value, people will panic and dump it and it will collapse hard.  It has to be bought back and removed from the market when demand drops to keep its value up.
The owners of tether presumably profit by earning interest on the USD they hold and transaction fees.  So in theory, they should be able to afford to fully back tether.  I just don't see it happening if tether loses popularity.  Once they know its being dumped for a different coin, they can keep the USD that was backing it and walk away.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:19:51
Except forex deals in currencies that have value as a currency.  Bitcoin has no value as a currency right now.
That makes a big difference in volatility.

How does one swap tether for usd?  Being backed by a dollar means nothing if you can't swap them at will.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:50:23
Not really.  They created a coin out of thin air to capitalize on the fact that exchanges don't want to touch USD due to regulatory implications and that users will use tether on foreign exchanges to restore the previous IRS rules around taxing crypto.
If USD didn't introduce additional regulations, people would just be swapping crypto with USD on gdax instead of crypto for tether on binance.
Tether doesn't really improve liquidity because the times when everyone wants to swap bitcoin for usd will be the times everyone wants to swap bitcoin for tether.  Bitcoin on binance should increase or decrease against tether the same as bitcoin on gdax would increase or decrease against USD.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:26:47


That means nothing if you can't swap it for the dollar.  If only tether can print and destory tether, then they must manage it to keep it pegged at 1 dollar.  Saying its pegged to a dollar doesn't work.

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:00:33
It isn't backed by anything, they basically have to manage the supply of tether by selling it and buying it back to keep it at the same value as a dollar.  This would have to be done on an exchange level.
Printing tether is fine if that is what is needed to keep it on par with the dollar.  The real question is when growth stops and they must start buying it back?  They could just abandon it and let it crash.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:32:30


That is not dramatic.  There is nothing propping up the value.  There is no reason why it is going to go back up at all.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:47:25


It has no value to anyone, that is why it fails as a currency.

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:02:53
No it is not.  Tether has the same underlying value as any crypto, none.  Its all supply and demand.
Tether supply must be actively managed against tether demand to keep its value at 1 USD.  This is easy to do when there is growth as you just print tether, but when there are collapses in demand, they are going to have to buy tether back.  
Obviously they are only going to do that to a point and when they decide to abandon it, tether will crash.
I would say tether is completely propped up by US tax code.  People are using it on foreign exchanges to jump in and out of crypto without having to be taxed on every transaction.  When they cash out and move crypto back to a US exchange and sell into USD, that is all they log on taxes.

@_date: 2018-06-27 17:14:09


That is what it is.  If it fails as a currency, all other value is lost.  The hope of adoption as a currency is the only thing giving it value.
Also, the fact that it is failing as a currency is why its so volatile, there is no inherent value propping it up.  That is why no current value is safe.  It can keep dropping back to pennies a bitcoin because there is no underlying value preventing it.

The entity that loans you the stock can close your position at any time if they fee the losses are high enough that you might not be able to cover them.
That is why shorting is so dumb.  You cannot hold a short long term to dig yourself out.  If the losses get too high, your short could be called in and you lose money. The stock could crash the next day, but your still owe the full losses from the day before.
Shorting bitcoin is extremely dumb because of how volatile it is.

I can tell elon musk is an obsession of yours, but tesla is not the only EV maker or battery pack maker.
Your infatuation with elon doesn't make EVs dangerous.  Just so you know, in 10 years, all new cars will be EVs, it is a government mandate due to emissions.  If you have EVs, you are going to have to confine yourself to a shack in the middle of nowhere to get away from them.

Luckily we are discussing the US.  Long range EVs are not needed in europe, so it is never a market tesla was going to be strong in.  Every crap EV out there works when the furthest drive is 50mi instead of +500mi.
