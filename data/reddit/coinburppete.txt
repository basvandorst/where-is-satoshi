My name is Pete, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinBurp - [
(For what it’s worth, for the past 5 years I have ran the largest UK Bitcoin brokerage, named BitBroker, on Localbitcoins amounting over 140000 trades across 30000 customers - [
CoinBurp launched a few weeks ago and are hoping to disrupt the likes of Coinbase with a number of key features:
* We’re one of the first crypto trading platforms to secure supportive UK banking
* We offer i**nstant, no fee GBP deposits** (with UK Faster Payments)
* There are **no trading fees**
Currently, we can offer 4 cryptocurrencies for you to trade between: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. In the coming months, this number will increase dramatically.
As a huge advocate of Reddit (I've personally been using it for a number of years!) and its community, I really want this project to be built with the help of you all! I am completely open to feedback, good or bad, and would love to hear what you all think!
Cheers, Pete

I appreciate everyone has their opinions on coins, but I leave that up to the customers to make that decision! I will not push my personal preferences on my customers; it’s a democracy!

FWIW, I have been in the crypto space for about 5 years now and am the CEO and Co-Founder of BitBroker, the UK's largest brokerage operating on Localbitcoins - if you have purchased Bitcoins via UK bank transfer on there you have probably used us!

When will the halving start having an effect on the price? Or has it started already?
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:33:28
I really appreciate the feedback and I’m sorry to hear you’re not convinced yet!
As a direct impact of hearing everyone’s feedback, and yours especially, I have decided to focus more on improving our navigation bar and general information around what makes us, us. You will see a big change in the coming weeks highlighting exactly why we feel we can make a difference in this space.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:50:02
Thanks very much!

It will continue to be difficult for the general public to use Bitcoin for everyday use until:
* Funds are easily accessible while being secure and insured
* Your standard bricks and mortar stores have the technology to become more accepting
Coinbase have recently released their 'crypto' debit card but it's nothing more than a fad. You are paying 3% for the novelty of paying at stores with 'crypto'. At it's current state, why not continue to fiat and save on the 3%?
I am aware stores are charged horrendous fees from their card processors (something crypto can definitely disrupt), but until we see monetary benefits for both the consumer and business' point of view it will never become mainstream.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:07:00
No worries, and thank you for your honesty and well wishes!
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:56:27
We wanted to go for something that felt fun and gave us some wiggle room for branding and marketing!
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:38:10
It depends what you are looking to do. If you purely want to purchase some cryptocurrency and hope to make profit, then this will definitely be one of the easiest options for you. The ability to cash back out easily to EUR will work well too, but exactly to pay around a 2% markup for the convenience. The issue here is that you will never own the cryptocurrency you purchase. What you are doing here is trading the difference in price.
Alternately, sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange capable of giving you 'real' crypto. You will then be free to withdraw this to a safer location such as a wallet in your possession.
If you want convenience, go for the first option. If you want to truly own the crypto, go for the second option.

Firstly, thank you, and I intend to be extremely active in the cryptocurrency community, answering any questions where possible.
Unfortunately, one thing we cannot do (and it's something you may have seen me speak about in the other sub!) is to offer a fiat on and off-ramp without KYC. It is, I'm afraid, the nature of the beast if I am to operate in this space.
Regarding your addresses question, the security of wallets is an extremely hot topic for me (as I'm sure you can appreciate). As such, I will be trusting the wallet functionality to experienced, third-party wallet providers such as BitGo. The downfall of this is that I am bound by their functionality! They for sure offering batching at the moment, and I hope they will offer bech32 addresses and Lightning network tech soon too!
And for the name, it's not to everyone's taste!

Apologies for the confusion. I understand how it may have looked misleading so I have altered that bullet point - let me know if that works for you!

Not currently as it was always our intention to get to the market quickly in the first instance! In our phase 2 roadmap we are seriously considering an option where all customer funds are held in cold storage and can also be insured for any losses. With the method, you gain security but lost convenience as withdrawals can only be processed a couple times a day due to not having a hot wallet.
What would you prefer - fully insured cold storage but slow withdrawals, or 95% insured cold storage but fast withdrawals with a hot wallet?

Yes the analogy you chose is spot on!
The public key/address can be used, like an IBAN, to receive funds into. Any money sent to your public address will be credited in your wallet.
The private key, and something you will never see with Trezor, is like your key to a lock. With regards to cryptocurrency, this private key is needed so you can prove you are the owner and needed to send funds out. The beauty of a Trezor is that they do all the hard work for you! You just follow the simple instructions on their website and device!
Hope that helps.
Thanks, Pete

We brainstormed the name for quite a while, and I completely understand that it's a bit of a love/hate brand name, but ultimately we wanted to have fun with it. The idea of breaking the misconception that only techie guys could understand to concept of crypto was important to us, and that began by going with a fun name!

The carousel of cryptos is meant to be random, but I think it's a bit buggy at the moment (I will speak to the devs tomorrow!)
If you refresh the page, I imagine you will see the order change!
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:35:49
Apologies but there is a bug in the carousel as the list should be random, but if you refresh you will notice the order change!
I will work on getting this fixed this week!
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:30:41
No worries, and I appreciate the questions!
Firstly, we do not pitch ourselves as an exchange and customers will not benefit from the great pricing they have - we are aiming specifically for the low confidence users, trying to enter the market for the first time. You will notice our UI is extremely simple and easy to use; all this of this intentional.
I do not believe Coinbase can credit INSTANTLY - this is something we can do with all U.K. bank transfers that hit our account from the correct account name and with the correct reference.
If you are experienced enough to understand how orderbooks work, then for sure continue to use CoinbasePro as we cannot compete with pricing or functionality!
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:56:16
Sorry! Commented on another guys’ post - the carousel order should be random but it’s a bit buggy at the moment. Give the page a refresh and let me know if the order changes!
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:56:55
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:24:31
Thank you! Just for your reference, we can instantly credit GBP deposits, with no hold at all. We will also be introducing instant GBP withdrawals in the next month if that’s something you’re interested in!
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:39:01
I prefer to stay cryptocurrency agnostic and will not push my personal preferences onto my customers. I completely understand if you have strong opinions about certain coins, and I’m sorry that you wouldn’t use my website, but having certain cryptocurrencies listed is not a reflection of my personal support!
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:34:30
There's a saying you will hear a lot around these forums - not your keys, not your coins!
I have personal experience using a Trezor and can highly recommend them. The UI is extremely easy to use, even for beginners! With a trezor, you will truly own the private keys (unlike in Coinbase).
