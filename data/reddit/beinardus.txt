You must see each channel as a boat crossing a river. When it is at your side, you are able to enter the boat. If the boat is on the other side, it first has to cross the river to pick you up. The boat will only leave if someone wants to travel in the opposite direction.
Now replace "you" with the 1$. And there is 10$ to transfer. The boat needs to make 20 trips to get all the money to the other side.
Because LN is a dense network of channels, money can travel in the opposite direction to arrive at the destination. But this only applies to the channels in the middle. Not to the channels of the sender or receiver.

The first part of the blockchain syncs quickly. It is because blocks are not full. The more data is in the blocks, the slower it gets. As said, it's not the speed of receiving blocks over the internet. Look at your performance monitor (if you sync on Windows). It's a combination of CPU speed and disc access.
I had to reindex the whole blockchain last week to make it usefull for a lnd node. It was going at 0.8% increase an hour. After long fiddling with settings, the biggest improvement was to replace the hard drive with a SSD drive (80 euro). Increase your dbcache setting to about 4 gig (or larger if you have &gt; 8 gig internal memory)
Let it use almost every core in your PC.
This increased the speed to about 8% an hour.
Let's hope we stay at 1mb block size :)

You are searching through the whole range of keys. But maybe the range is limited by the fact that i know addresses that were generated by the same HD wallet.
Let's say we have a very basic random function. If i know the seed, i get a fixed sequence of pseudo random numbers. If i don't know the seed, but i know the sequence of random numbers, it is possible to derive the seed by brute forcing the function with seeds.
This will probably work if the total possible seeds is limited, and i know that the numbers i received are adjacent and in the order they were created, and the first number i see is near the beginning of the sequence.
I think all these factors make it impossible to brute force a HD wallet because everything is huge when it comes to bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:38:56
Default is 300 ([
It's in MB. It will contribute to your performance in the long run, as it will find more cache hits.Don't make it too big. There is a lot of memory already in use by the system. Avoid creation of swap files, that would be a huge performance drop! I would say 4000 is about the max on a 8GB system.

Can someone ELI15 instead of pointing to a highly technical BIP?
I think it is like hashes. If you know the source, you know the hash. If you know the hash however, there are unlimited sources that lead to the same hash. So having a hash does reveal het source just a little (you can exclude every source that generates a different hash).
But when you have n hashes, and these are all generated from the same source, doesn't it mean that you know n times little?

I think the only way to get bitcoin in and out lntip is by using a lightning wallet. The easy way (and most reliable for now) is to use a custodial wallet like Blue Wallet. Of course, to exchange it for old cash, you have to pay extreme high fees for such small tipping money to get it in reasonable time. But why should you anyway?

In fact, the mathematics itself is not hard; You take all transactions in a block, add some random data and calculate a hash. This hash is a (very large) number. A single change in the data, gives a total different number.
There is something called "difficulty", that acts as a threshold. If your found number is less than the threshold, you found a valid block.
If it's not a valid block, you try again with another random number.
The difficulty is used to ensure the average time to find a new block is 10 minutes. If the mining increases, the difficulty increases. If the mining drops, the difficulty decreases.
It's also great for securing the network if the difficulty is high; it makes it hard to run the famous 51% attack.

@_date: 2018-11-04 23:44:59
I know it is against the rule of "don't trust, verify", but you can download then whole blockchain using torrent:
This is sufficient for using in Bitcoin Core, but it lacks the txindex. Someone replied that txindex is no longer required for LN, but all tutorials i've seen still mention using it. And reindexing it afterwards is no option, because it probably takes the same time as downloading the whole blockchain using Bitcoin Core.
Other option is to buy a cheap SSD (&gt; 200GB) and use it for the initial blockchain synchronisation. Then, when finished, copy the whole thing to the external HDD and mount it to the raspberry.
When no longer needed, you can use the SSD to transfer your OS to the SSD and enjoy how quick your computer boots and get rid of the noise of scratching disks.

10009 is the gRPC port. I think you are looking at the wrong log entry; the cause of the error is probably some lines above. Search for:
[INF] RPCS: RPC server listening on 127.0.0.1:10009
Best way to see what is going on, is to run this command in a new putty session (as described in the guide):
sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
Then in another putty session, restart your LND service and scan the output.
The unknown cipher is probably because the cipher is generated using another wallet (not the LND internal wallet)

Yes. Happened to me too. There is no way to recover your 2FA when using Google Authenticator. I had to contact the exchange to remove the 2FA setting from my account. They needed proof of identity to remove 2FA. This had to be a selfy with a readable identification (driver license / passport)

This QR code is a url of a web page that shows the QR code of an invoice. Each visit generates a new invoice.
I think the LN wallet has to be "smart"; if it scans a QR code of a LN invoice, then use that QR code. If it is an url of a web page, then use the QR code shown on that page.

I used the instructions from the RaspiBolt guide (Stadicus).
My node is only accessible through the onion address and I'm able to connect to other Tor nodes. So, yes, it works in both ways.
Some remarks:
* Nodes that are not using Tor can't open a channel with you
* [1ML.com]( tracks changes of your url. Switch also from pubkey at the moment you switch to Tor (unless privacy is not of your concern)

The funding transaction is the same as "channel\_point". Only the hex before the colon. Use listchannels + pendingchannels to see all channels.You can look it up using [blockchain.info]( also to see the confirmations.The output index is the number after the colon.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:41:35
Just use these values. You can use other ports if you want, but the ports can't be the same.
You have to restart the bitcoind service if you change them.
These are only internal ports, your bitcoin node is (default) published on port 8333 (or 18333 for testnet)
@_date: 2019-01-30 23:06:18
In this case there is no need for spontaneous payments. The destination node is predefined.
What is needed is a web API on this destination node that publishes invoices with a fixed price. The LND command is *addinvoice*.
Then on the other end (the sender node), call this web API and feed the result to the LND command *payinvoice*.
This is how the pac-man demo was made, but they had no custom sender software and had to use a QR code to paste in their wallet. In this demo you see them switch from the site: [ to their mobile LN app to paste the code.

Ah, i misunderstood your question. I thought you meant technical difficulties.

It is quite common to publish your bitcoin address to a website for donations. This is impractical for lightning, because you can't pay directly to a lightning address. To pay someone, that person first has to make an invoice and send the invoice to you. Then you pay the invoice.
To make such an invoice, the website has to interact with a lightning node. This requires special payment software.  
When it is possible to pay directly to a lightning address, websites can just publish the lightning address.

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:06:43
Some reasons i can think of:
* You are doing the IBD directly on the Raspberry. Better use more powerful equipment for that. Mount the drive to the Raspberry after IBD is finished.
* Maybe the external drive drains too much power from the usb. Use a cable with external power supply.
* Configure the Raspberry to store the swapfile to the external drive.

Node is still running and survived its first power failure. I skipped the part of the testnet. Already took this course with Eclair on my phone.
I had some troubles with the hardware. Mounting a disk can be tricky. If you use the wrong UUID you have to plug in a keyboard and monitor to revive the pi.
I had a wrong copy of the blockchain (no txindex), so it took me another 3 days to reindex it.
I had several problems with the drive, probably because of a 1.5A power source. (the guide recommends 2.5A+ when using the USB of the pi to power the drive).
Then i had it running for a while as a full node (my major goal), before i took the last step to install LND.
Installing LND is no sweat. There was one problem. I had zmqpubrawblock and zmqpubrawtx (in bitcoin.conf) pointing to the same port number (29000?). This gave some faque error during startup. Use the latest version of the guide and you be fine.
Then when i read the instructions on how to send back the testnet coins (paragraph "Send back your testnet Bitcoin"), i was convinced that i could do the same thing for the mainnet if i desperate needed my pocket money back.
I assumed LND reused the wallet.dat file of the bitcoin node. Instead you get a fresh wallet and have to make an onchain transaction to fund it. There is no way to get the private key of it, so you can only use the lncli commands to move the funds.
If you copy the scripts in the guide, the LND node is configured in autopilot mode. This takes away all the fun. After i funded the node's wallet it immidiately started to open a new channel to a "random" node.
Then i send some tip to the author using [yalls.org]( (this was the hardest part because of poor UX)
I turned off autopilot and created my own channel. Included 1000 satoshis as a tip to the target node.
Buyed some stickers ("I got lightning network running and all i got is this lousy sticker") as everyone with a LN node should do. Two stickers for only 3 euro shipping costs ;)
Funded lntip bot with a LN transaction.
I wrote down each instruction i discovered during the journey and carfully saved all onchain transactions to track on [blockchain.info](
These are some interesting sites out there (also mentioned in the guide):
* [
* [
* [
If you have everyhing in place, you can find your node on 1ml and lndexplorer. I don't know why lndexplorer shows unreachable for most of the nodes. Even the big ones of LNBIG..
The api reference is a bit confusing; if you talk to lncli, you don't talk directly to the API. For instance, payinvoice is not listed, but is one the most important commands.
All commands are well documented in lncli:
* "lncli -h" for all commands
* "lncli \[command\] -h" for detailed information on a command
Other things confusing as a non native English speaker: "balance" and "rebalance". The first is how much money you have in the wallet. The second is related to the distribution of wealth within the channel.
Also good to know: Every transaction to someone else (except for opening a channel) is started with an invoice. You can't just send some money around.
I have no real application for it at the moment. I hope i help the network by keeping it online. And when onchain transaction costs spike again, i am already prepared. (with some pocket money)
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:09:07
Okay, I can understand that it is required for the first connection you ever make, but looking at the log, LND is capable enough to find all other connections by itself. So either the pubkey is not unique by itself, or the method connect is too restrictive to require more than just a pubkey.
@_date: 2018-12-22 12:02:49
I like the idea, but advertising your LN node is exposing your IP.
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:54:32
To manually create a channel to a node:
* Search the node you want to connect with using the site 1ml or lndexplorer
Look for the "public key" or pubkey for short. You need to extend the key with the IP address (prefixed with " and port number (prefixed with ":") found elsewhere on the page:
* Create a connection
on the raspberry:
*lncli connect &lt;pubkey&gt;
It returns {}
* Open a channel:
*lncli openchannel &lt;pubkey&gt; &lt;amount\_in\_satoshis\_for\_yourself&gt; &lt;amount\_satoshis\_for\_other&gt;*
Be careful with *amount\_satoshis\_for\_other.* Better leave it out if you are not confident.
This command returns information of your onchain transaction. You can lookup the transaction in [blockchain.info]( to see when it gets confirmed and how many transaction fees it costs.
Before you make a connection to a node, check out if it has sufficient balance / connections /uptime / not too high transaction fee. Or it must be just a node you want to connect with.

u/Stadicus I think there are some problems with the configuration of Tor in your guide:
* "listen=localhost" is a setting under "\[Application Options\]", not "\[Tor\]"
* "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" is only for "strech", i'm on "jessie"
According to the Tor site, i should just change "stretch" to "jessie". And when i do so, i can finish the installation with no problem. But when i test the version, it still shows the old 0.2.5.16 version. I build a  0.3.4.9 version using these instructions:
And then ~~i copied the tor executable over the version in /usr/bin.~~
Read the README file in the tar:  
./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
The directory structure is a little bit different. The config file is located in /usr/local/etc/tor and has to be renamed from torrc.example to torrc

False. LN even runs on Raspberries.

Another addition for the guide:
You wrote how you could withdraw the balance of the testnet node ("Send back your testnet Bitcoin"). There is a flaw in the instruction that is not important for testnet, but can cause loss of money when using these on mainnet.
This maybe especially important for moving to Tor, since it is recommended to create a new node:










Here you should add:
$ lncli pendingchannels
A pending channel occurs when the counterparty is offline when closing the channel. Then there are satoshis in limbo until the channel is released by its contract. These satoshis in limbo are not shown when calling channelbalance.
Ofcourse, it is possible to recover the node since the user wrote down the password phrase, but it would be highly inconvenient and maybe the user doesn't even notice, thinking LN is expensive.
