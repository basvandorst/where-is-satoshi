looks like it still trends upwards but then dropping off sharp when some tool sells on low volume, affecting the price to the maximum.
maybe its a more cost effective attack than memepool spamming and propping up an altcoin? /conspiracy
Honestly though what kind of tool wants to sell off as it is climbing out of a dip?

Btc movements evade trading, either it trends upwards for a long time, downwards, or sideways. Too low and it will get bought up and reverse.

Well, another look and starblocks seems to be fixed, yay. But lightning channel I funded is offline ( and thus effectively locks away the funds indefinately it seems, quite a big flaw there hmm ).
@_date: 2018-09-08 06:55:36
Yep exactly, pointless to go and waste effort there. The only goal is to defraud and undermine cryptocurrency from the beginning. It takes much more effort to form reasonable arguments (for whatever purpose) than to troll and snake around wasting someones time. Nobody's being convinced.

I don't use playstore. Any official alternatives ie fdroid, github?

I think this is the more interesting question. I think either this is just commonly pumped up FUD (it shouldn't be hard to find some massive wallets you can fit a narrative to or get people worked up over, the coins may even be related to op), or op is invested in finding out the destination of specific coins for whatever reason.
If someone stupidly came out and indicated they knew the owners then it all could fit a social engineering attempt via reddit to identify someone. An admin can easily look back stage if someone pops out.
Edit: judging by the rediculous votes and frivolous replies I'm going with FUD, in same way crappy memes painting btc in a bad light get pumped up to r/all in a matter of minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:32
wow, just as entertaining as when smashing up throuh sell walls of 1000+ btc in seconds..
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:34:41
What if that was the plan, to take down coinbase and majorly crash btc. didn't the bcash crew dump a load of coins on finex (who they say shit about all the tume) the first attack? I thought finex would've took that and ran at the time.

Yeah, don't trust bockchain com or info, with anything. Roger is involved with 1 or both, can't remember which, abused admin at 1 and is major investor or owner of 1. Notice how you were ignored at the other place. Looks like you got scammed.
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:16:29
imo its a waste of effort. Its probably best to silently ignore whatever shit is typed in that scamhole, or do high disruption per effort skimming over what you agree/disagree is a scammers alt, then come back here and post for real discussion, increasing activity here.
If you can't tell, its mainly a few personalities with dozens or hundreds of astroturfing accounts flinging meaningless shit, vote manipulating, and using yours or others reasonable posts to confuse. you're giving them ammo and painting a big bullseye on reasonable arguments to attack. At least make them come here and do it so they divide their attention.
Let the few loony obsessives there waste their time to fake some activity and argue with themselves... or not and let it become a ghosttown. Either way, this place has the high ground. As long as their ticker has its chief scammers face stamped on it, they've lost, and it always will, I know obsession, let it bury them.
Just a random persons opinion.

That starblocks site doesn't even work on mobile for me. F
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:21:23
I see, thanks. This poses lots of other questions about attack vectors, like nodes being intentionally unreliable /blocking or dos'ed. Interesting, time to read up I 'spose.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:13:08
I think its inevitable there'll be a major battle to own a significant portion of future money or risk missing out. 10k step ups per day as corporations jump in to feast.
edit: if this starts happening I think all expectations are off, it won't matter that millionaire's will be cashing out everywhere, big corps will want to buy it all up and it'll surge through $1m within days.
Or/and a top exchange gets taken out and shakes btc..
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:45:16
I like to ponder that its a bounty on breaking crypto, not intentional, but who knows.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:40:23
Great post and discussion. More like this please
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:19:16
its probably that loon dumping his btc tonight in an idiotic rage. hopefully he sells it all.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:41:18
same, and no idea, just a casual observer but remember bookmarking something a while back. The intentions seem to have played out and the language is spot on, I think thats all that counts. There must be more out there.
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:31:16
Note upload date
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:26:30
  
there's that. Note the upload date, stated intentions and terminology used, before the fork was even live.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:54:54
I don't think they're going anywhere any time soon. They're holding a lot of crap coins and with multiple new forks, they can spin off from the scammy bch image and have multiple chances to paint a new image and 'all work together against the banksters'...
only to attempt another takeover later and even unload over lightning or however.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:38:35
Get shady lightning wallet and node software established, taint lightning with a parasitic network, pair it with bch and unload their bstash as alternative tokens and again attack and cripple the btc blockchain, btc take over attempt again. I think a decision has been made.
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:50:04
sure most posts like this are made and pumped by bashers tbh. Trolls getting a free ride to crap all over a public facing resource &amp; hub for discussion. Look at my little exchange here, theyre obvious as hell. Wouldn't surprise me if they outnumber regular interested people at times. Respect.
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:52:41
Really not all the subs fault is it? Posts like this are made and vote-spammed by fudsters and antis that want btc to fail, while normal people go about their business.
It would be better if the sub was more heavily moderated imo.
Look at just this thread, so many posts solely to attack, no other reason for them to be in here.
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:12:23
Ahaha well played
@_date: 2019-03-18 09:01:41
Great channel.
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:29:54
Wew there, hostile much?
Its an adversarial space with a lot of vested interests from various partys yes, so a lot of bad actors and 'FUDSTERS'. Who are you trying to tell that there aren't? Where've you been? Have you not seen the countless replys and votespammmed shitposts that just shit all over btc with pointless quips? I'm guessing you have.
Yep, various partys make censorship a talking point while simultaneously brazenly censoring and using it to exploit the naive. What is wrong with shutting down the most obvious trolls, and gently steering things back to a state of optimism and information?
"Totally delusional"... lol totally not trolling huh?  Nice try bud.


Ah, there it is, always obvious with you lot. Maybe work out who you're angry with and why, trolling wont fix your fkup.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:36:19
can't see why these atms can't issue a redeemable receipt of some sort.. buy currency, get receipt with unique proof of purchase, redeem for cash hour later by scanning a qr, or monitor confirmations on your device then go cash in when confirmed.
Edit: for selling that is.
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:59:10
Good question, and I think thats a problem with the atm methodology itself (or any point of sale) rather than specific to this, regular atms could do the same but I suppose have developed robust and auditable operation should something go wrong, maybe use industry standard mechanisms.
The atm would need to regularly scam limited amounts from people Vs incentive of many people diverting before confirmation. The latter can be prevented and remove the barrier to putting atms out there, the former makes the atm company accountable and is harder to get away with.
Edit: I sensed something off when you weirdly brought up something about trust and the point of bitcoin first thing, so dug a little.. you're pretty hostile to /anti btc aren't you? Why is that? and if you're just trolling I relly don't see the point here..
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:49:08
Not sure I follow, the atm assures its cash sales get confirmation first, the person gets accountability and proof of sale. For that small settlement window. Enabling greater usage, more atms able to give cash.
@_date: 2019-06-17 12:38:47
make sure the clock on the device matches that of the other, or correct time is synced from the net?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:12:39
Its not a debate, its a continual hijacking attempt by a gang of scammers. Does somebody with altruistic intent conduct that big of a deception campaign?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:51:33
Its an astroturfing account
@_date: 2019-02-19 11:51:25
Used to do this on halflifes games. Another character would crash the game if it appeared in public or pm message. Mem editing the name and playerinfo clientside had some weird effects too. Scriptsploited, memhacked and nethacked that engine to shreds, it was so open to all kinds of crazyness.

Those who bought this morning at 9k will be up nearly 3%, around $250 in less than a day. 2 weeks ago it dipped to around 5400, buying that dip will have got you close to 4k profit today after 13 days. 
Day trading, buying and selling dips for 1% per day for 2 years starting with 500 will make you over half a mil. Making 3% per day for 2 years starting at $10 will get you $17billion if successful, you'll bleed out your coins if attempting day trading when it trends constantly up like this though.
It could go to $0 at any time, but hasn't yet.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:47:00
Makes sense. Seeing so much trolling by some who even expose themselves as anti crypto/btc just makes that my first thought by default tbh. A middle view is hard to maintain.

It doesn't work like that
@_date: 2019-04-26 10:31:40
doesn't matter to the media consumers its wheeled out to. Hacker news, Ars etc are always happy to spread it so it does its job.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:47:39
more likely anti's squatting in the sub, shitposting and crapping on a public facing hub, exploiting the naivety of muh anticensorship for a right ol' giggle.

It actally is. Certain people need to be shaken out (thats what it looks like, and no better time) while those in it to use and improve it keep calm and carry on. ouch, feel that sting.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:31:04
media despises crypto even online places like Ars. They shit all over it any time it twitches, while sucking off criminal tech monopolists like microsoft, google, amazon etc. Id say majority of people are against btc, theyre either salty for missing out, or for not getting out, or have been conned/Fudded by bad actors. It might be that the technology is just too good and disruptive to succeed.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:45:50
The exchanges are fools shouldve delisted those clowns long ago. There were even threats to doublespend involving exchanges iirc.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:48:52
An early investor could crash the market and still make millions on their entry point not caring if it could have increased tenfold, or even made more while doing it. Imo it looks like someone selling big chunks driving the price down even while the price generally trended upwards.. but that's kinda conspiracy talk.

@_date: 2018-02-03 06:26:42
I predict 3 years till lightning is out of beta, because of complexity and standardization red tape. It takes single or a few brilliant obsessive minds without restrictions to make big leaps and get things rolling imo.
But what's stopping merchants buying and selling/forwarding orders on for steam games or groceries or anything now over the LN network?

Quick, someone running a lightning hub, anyone, foward on an order for pizza delivery, be the first and make headlines. Seems easy enough.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:01:15
I can't see that happening tbh, nor even $100k or for that matter $50k. Think about the hoarders, dormant wallets with 1000s of coin already. When do you exit? How confident are you your holdings will never go to $0 because of attacks or something?
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:41:04
Yep absolutely, but I do think we'll see more and more taking their winnings to live comfortably as adoption grew at those previous points to start making it happen now. Well be talking many multi-billionares at some point, and if those people will still be quielty watching their unprecedented wealth balloon..
I don't think the risks of complete collapse are falling, I see them increasing as time goes on, risk of weaknesses being exploited, risks to development, developers, imagine something catastrophic needing a rollback on the blockchain, is there even the smallest chance of that ever happening?
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:21:45
its an old troll account giving you the runaround. I'm late, but yep, just going back over old fudders names and stuff seeing what's happening. Keep doing what you do man.
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:02:19
looks sketchy af, very convoluted details, same blogger posted about lightning on some bca altcoin.Also said this:  
"Second, I want to try various approaches which currently seem nonviable on BTC based LN and see how they play out:"
I don't think that's legit at all, is it?
Edit: yep, bogus. Fake and scammy as hell, not lightning. clowns are so obvious.
