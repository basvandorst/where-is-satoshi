Never fails. Doesn’t matter what it is. Anything that hits the news cycle will include self righteous pretentious hipsters declaring it somehow associated with racism or sexism.

Expressing displeasure at perceived insider trading is not necessarily a call for government regulation. Free market regulation exists, this would include complaining in open forums and convincing others to abandon the offending exchange platform in this case. Or this could include applying pressure on them to adopt a commitment to a more proactive and transparent approach, or expressing demand in the market for alternatives that will meet these needs.

Virus? Ha, no ma’am it’s direct to chrome store. I don’t have enough skill or malicious intent to phish. Just a dumb text replacement extension, I thought would be amusing.
