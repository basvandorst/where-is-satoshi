I think we need to look at other solutions.  DASH gives 45% to miners. 45% to masternodes and 10% to the core development.  DASH is constantly developing.  
The truth is it really doesn't matter which coin takes the lead because all are Satoshi's vision.  Bitcoin better get its stuff together or an alt-coin will take the crown.  
Would take miners, and companies like coinbase, about 5mins to switch to another coin.

That was my first guess too but this could be transaction delay time.  Unfortunately if so we've got only ourselves to blame. (And the Chinese miners)

The bank reports (Form I-9) it if you have an American passport.  Law is called FACTA.  If the bank doesn't they lose their ability to use the US Dollar which is death for a financial institution. 
If you have a second passport well then.........

If it did add costs then pass those costs to the consumer.  Zero logical reason to argue why to shut off and not just increase.  I'd they charged 2% before, goto 5%   people would still use. 
LibertyX increases their fees and you barely heard a peep from the community.  Circle would have been different but lots still would use them.  
--they would have avoided the bad press
--saved a LOT of clients from leaving their ecosystem
Seriously had to be a non business decision.  
Circle is also super emotional (again not logical) about President Trump. They also have to listen to their funders and do whatever they say. 
That's the truth of what happened.

Owner of BetCRIS is Ron. (aka Bookmaker)
Owner of 5dimes is Tony
You can google yourself.  It's not like this information is hidden or secret.  Both guys always pay always. Both have huge operations with hundreds of employees.  
Both have been in trouble with the US government many many times. Bookmaker.com the domain even got seized by the government.  Yet all customers and affiliates and employees still got paid 100%.  
So yeah.  I'm gonna say both are rock solid outs.  Both accept Bitcoin for deposits but wagers in US Dollars.  You can w/d in Bitcoin also.  
You can risk it on a new place like nitrogen sports but I like to keep my gambling on the game and not in the hope the establishment I'm betting with pays me out.

Coinbase accepts they have to start handing over documents and filling out 1099 forms.

As long as we continue to expand the base of people using Bitcoin we're doing well. That's the most important thing.  Expand people using and asking merchants if they'll Bitcoin.  
More transactions and more usage and the price will take care of itself.  We should triple every year for the next few. 
Approx $2500 to $3000 by end of year.  $10,000 the next year.  $30,000 in 2019 or 2020.  
Once we hit $30,000 we'll be about where we should be and the price will stabilize.

We absolutely do NOT want any additional regulation. Be better if government stayed the hell away from bitcoin.

Uh no.  If the vote happened on a weekend or the week after he probably would have lost the electoral vote too. Most people voted for Trump as the lesser or two evils and because they want less regulation and less taxes.

@_date: 2017-02-01 13:44:57
Wow.  You're so ignorant if you really think this.  You need to get out into the real world and meet real people.  Trolling?   
There were only two choices.  Most Trump voters just thought he was the better choice than Hillary.   Many of us also just always vote republican because we want less tax and less regulation as more government is just a bigger magnet for corruption as the rich and well connected make millions they shouldn't.  Same reason I support Bitcoin.  
THATS THE TRUTH.  Not some insane racist theory that the media tells you is happening.  
You've got so much hate and close mindedness. You need to be able to be open to other concepts other than the ones you're spoon fed through whatever media outlet is relaying this nonsense.  You'll not only understand the world better but you'll be so much more successful in life.

Well written article.  Hard to see how successfully ETF doesn't shoot us up immediately  $100 after acceptance.  
For sure over $1500 in the first month and even higher if we can hit $1Billion.  
Unfortunately, it will almost for sure be denied.  That will drop the price 5% or so.  Hopefully bounce back.  
That's my education guess.

Trump already has enacted an EO on limiting new regulations.  If this holds it's probably his best contribution by far to our country. Not to mention he promises to lower taxes.  
To me those are the big two issues.  Less regulation especially when it comes to the Bitcoin economy is only going to be a positive.

All politicos lie.  Most of them probably sociopaths.  Some just hide it better. 
Obama has conducted a fully illegal war in the Middle East Im highly opposed to.  Drones all over for no reason.  Obama also violates our civil liberties with the NSA, CIA and FBI.  Obama also believes in more government and more tax.  
But because Obama is half black he has a ton of support. It's insane to me to support someone only because of their race but it's the entire reason Obama won and is who he is.  People wanted to feel good about themselves voting for a descendant of a slave which Obama isn't even one. 
Of course you're right that the republicans have failed us on smaller government.  At least they're saying they'll lower regulation and lower taxes.  All politicians lie. But I'd rather pick the party that at least says they'll lower government.  
Our election cycle is a complete joke.  We ended up with two people Hillary and Trump which both were terrible choices.  As far as 3rd party I did like Gary Johnson and he'd be my number 1 option over those two. 
But we're diverting off the main point. You were insulting all Trump supporters as racist idiots. Just because Trump lies it's not the end all be all as every single politician lies by the way and Hillary has lied many many many times. 
You need to quote REASONS why you don't like Trump so others like me will understand which are the main policies you oppose. When you do this think about if Obama did 100% of the things you liked?
We need to be able to have a decent conversation about the issues at hand.  Not react irrationally every time Trumps name is mentioned.  That shuts everyone down and makes my side convinced your side is just a bunch of crazy crying snowflakes.

Zero logical reason to leave Bitcoin. If compliance costs were too high they can raise the charge. Bitstamp charges 5% to 8% on card purchase and people still do it.  
Circle could have raised to 3% and still kept the vast majority of their business and way more people in their ecosystem.  
Circle even admitted that their Bitcoin business grew 50% in 2016.  Grows 50%.  Wow.

Look at headlines over this "Muslim ban". 
The headlines says "majority against Trump!!" And they're right. But your read the article and its 51% against.  If the poll was the other way the headline would read "public split down the middle on the ban"
That's media bias.  And it happens nonstop.  Another example is how wonderful the obama family is praised for doing nothing. "How sweet the daughter is going to college,etc". I don't remember these stories on the bush daughters and certainly not for Trump family.  
That's the bias.  It's impossible to  miss.

They stopped using Bitcoin after their bitcoin business grew 50% year over year.  
They stopped bitcoin even though making money and going to make even more.  
If not making money they could have just charged a higher %    goto 2 or 3% and still would have kept a ton of business. 
So they stopped bitcoin for purely political  (read anti-Bitcoin) reasons.  They are the very definition of the enemy.

I have to say CheapAir is great. I use them all the time.  I try to spend Bitcoin as often as I can to encourage the Bitcoin economy.  Plus many times it's more convenient than credit cards for me. 
Their new websites interface is excellent.  They save all your information which helps the next time you want to fly. Their phone service is really good as well.  
If you have a refund coming from airline can be a nightmare. From CheapAir you email you Bitcoin return address when you cancel flight and they send you the difference.  That is super nice.  
I've tried Destinia and they're getting better but you can't use them if you have a stop.  Nonstop they work ok.  
BTCFlights if they're still around was unusable. (Love to hear if anyone has different experiences)
So if you got a stop and want to pay in Bitcoin it's CheapAir.com and the Bitcoin community is lucky to have them.  
I'm super glad to hear their business is growing using Bitcoin!!

My account has problems for days now and support is not being helping.  Here are my issues:
--**My card balance shows zero.  It is NOT zero.  I am currently using my card and it is working.  That is the good news.**
--**I cannot transfer funds from my "wallet" to my card.  I have not been able to for days.**
--**I cannot send out my Bitcoin to another Bitcoin address.** 
I have contacted support of course many times.  It takes about 2 days to respond and they are not helpful.  My main question obviously is this ONLY me or are others having this issue?  Is this a "my card" issue or everyone cards issues.  They absolutely will not answer.  They did tell me to clear my cookies.  
I just want to know if anyone else is having this issue or is this only me?  Please help.

@_date: 2017-03-11 01:24:45
Now that I think I get this it is starting to sound amazing.  
Four Suggestions:
--Clearly explain the $500 per day limit.  I personally find this limit to be more than reasonable to start but it's important to display this.  
--Clearly explain the exchange rate. How do we know how much Bitcoin we're getting if we buy and how much cash we get if we sell?  
--Have an online tellers page.  I want to be a teller. I emailed in and got zero response.  I need a simple FAQ page and the basics so I can sign up.  
--Can a teller connect their "online wallet business" to ABRA?   For example if PAYPAL or NETELLER wanted to integrate.  Would you allow this?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:33:23
GDAX.   Or buy stuff.  Use bitcoins for flights on CheapAir.com is my main place to "sell" bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:44:40
Then give it a chance before name calling.  
The goal is that you click on bank.  Take out $500.  Then you convert to Bitcoin.  And vice versa. 
That sounds like Abra is converting it.  Don't see how there's a 3rd party at all but hell. Hope it works.

This is Bitpay's merchant service.  For example, I'm running a company want to accept Bitcoin.  So customers pay in Bitcoin but really the money goes to Bitpay.  They automatically convert the funds to dollars and charge 1%.

Wish you would have invested with us.   Price skyrocketed from $250 to $1150 in the last year or so.  Maybe 18 months.  Been such a fun ride.  
Good news is once we cross $1500 and back into uncharted territory it will be off to the races.  Probably $5000 or so but $30,000 wouldn't shock me in the least. 
Of course this is assuming two huge things. We solve the log jam for block size.  And USA doesn't outlaw exchanges on their land.  Either of those can hurt a lot.  
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:43:57
Makes complete sense. I fully agree. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:13:38
Yes. Stupid. 
Setup Blockchain.info or another wallet.  Never ever send directly from Coinbase.com to gambling sites. 
To be clear.  Send from Coinbase.com to Blockchain.info then to bovada.  
When cashing out do the same backwards. Never keep coin at Coinbase.com

What a complete joke this article is.  Now bitcoin is tanking.  Obviously someone in the SEC asked this guy to write this. 99% of anyone who knows of this ETF is supportive of it.

If Bank account and you don't have a USA passport it's simple.
If in Latin America go to Panama and open an account.  If in Asia goto Hong Kong or Singapore.  If in Middle East goto Dubai.  In Europe I'm not sure the best place to go as banking seems so difficult.  
Then wire small like 10k to your account. Then do the rest like 200k a month.  Simple.  
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:50:54

Fixed now.  Wow.  Seven days but glad it's solved!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:40:09
If you lose your password you should lose your Bitcoin. If someone else has access to your password means you don't own it.  
Open Protonmail email.  Use this to open blockchain.info account.  Send Bitcoin to blockchain.info and now your name ain't on those Bitcoins.  You can do this tomorrow. 
Then get yourself a Trezor or other option but at least this gets the coins away from Coinbase. 
(Keep in mind if you have a tiny amount like 1 Bitcoin or less I wouldn't bother with this.  Definitely if 10 bitcoins or more I'd move immediately)

@_date: 2017-03-06 01:32:11
For me this is true 
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:49:58
Exactly. So we need to lead and have the miners follow. But we can't lead because there's no governance model.  We must develop one and now.  
Decentralized, open source and community consensus must be established.  Segwit is a beyond obvious add on we should do.  How is it possible we have no method to implement Segwit?

Nothing is perfect. But comments like this don't help. The question is what is more secure?  Windows or Linux?  And it's not even a contest.  
One is a company that is legally required to work with them to infiltrate whatever they want.  The other is open source.  Open source isn't perfect but you think windows is better?

This is simple.  It is lower because many people use BTC-E to withdrawal from.  They take Bitcoin bring to BTC-E and withdrawal into Rubbles or Dollars or Euros.  
BTC-E has the lowest KYC enforcement so many people like to use this to cash out.  It will always be about 2-3% lower.  Then others go there to buy cheap Bitcoin but always 2-3% lower.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:06:18

Is there proof that Coinbase actually is holding "x" amount of Bitcoin?  I heard once they controlled 6% of Bitcoin but never saw an address. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:52:46
The definition of "structuring" is trying to avoid reporting requirements.  For example, putting maybe $9000 deposits in the bank (reporting requirements are at $10k).  Worst thing you can ever do.  You're much better doing a deposit for $12,000 then $9000.  Fill out the stupid paper because the IRS will shut your account so fast for structuring.  Moronic but they will.  
Not sure structuring can apply in these cases.  You could be right though.  
@_date: 2017-01-28 09:20:14
But when the most recent error?  I started Bitcoin in March 2016.  I've had zero issues.  Before then I assume?

Many Europeans think success in life is where you were born and how much your parents got.  Americans mostly do not think this way.  
Where you're born and who your parents are matter less than your own personal drive.  In fact Id say the poor generally have a much bigger drive than a lot of upper class people. 
Being born in Poland has many advantages that we don't have.  Just need to work with what you got.  You can succeed. It's all based on you.

YES!   Bitcoin at $7,000 is still only $100 Billion market cap.  This is nothing in the world of finance.
If Bitcoin really becomes mainstream and no reason to believe it wont, then $1 Trillion at least is more realitics.  That is $70,000 per coin
Once we pass $1000 I expect most exchanges and Bitcoin businesses will start to use mBTC as the main unit.  This alone will help it shoot up as mBTC will seem "cheap" at $1

I've probably personally directed 20 people to this site.  None of them have to give their info at all.  
They get your email and IP and that's it.   Using protonmail and VPN and this company has zero info on you and you can bank practically anonymous in the 21st century and easily.  Setup an account in minutes.

Blockchain is a ledger of payments.

Joe paid Harry 7pts.

Created 2pts for Bob.
And you add this all up from the dawn of day.  That's a Blockchain.   This is all bitcoin is.  5,000 or so users with the entire Blockchain downloaded since 2009. 
Replace Johnny and Sally with 1bfjrjrnejj33847ndnnf on every transaction of course.

Listen.  They voted to pass the law that Institutions that don't report Americans will get a 30% penalty.  That's all. 
The law says nothing about international agreements. The department of treasury made that up after to better enforce the law and streamline it.  With this the foreign governments made agreements and so did the department of treasury.  We agreed to report other people to their home country as well based on bank deposits.  
That's a treaty with two sides agreeing. That's the part that is unconstitutional based on the constitution. 
You'll have to cite examples of international treaties that are US law and we have to abide by not passed by the Senate.  I'm not aware of any but even if there are they'd be unconstitutional as well.

Trust me. When it was $2 no one thought $500 was realistic.  
$30,000 is only a total market cap of half a trillion.  That's still less than Apple is worth. That's one company.  Bitcoin would have the internets money.  
The combined wealth of the world is $250 Trillion or so.  You don't think Bitcoin can hit half a trillion?  I do.  
That's $30,000 a coin. Laugh if you want.

Excellent points 
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:58:10
Exactly.  If we get to 10% of gold that is $20,000 a coin.  
People don't need to understand Bitcoin to use it. I live overseas in Central America.   No one can use their credit cards because they're not based in USA.  Plus it's hard to bank here because of FATCA if American. 
This is NOT like USA. We all use Bitcoin.  My friend got paid in Bitcoin, put it in blockchain.info.  Saw it go up from $500. Uses it for hotels on Expedia and flights on cheap Air and to play online poker.   
He has NO CLUE how it works.  And he doesn't need to. He's using it because it's easy for him.  He thinks blockchain.info is Bitcoin.  We need more of him to grow.

No way.  Too much uncertainty.  They could have gone under. Their plan with tokens worked perfectly. 
I can promise those tokens will never disappear even when they pay all back.  Eventually they'll be worth $1.20 or so and people will get interest on them.  
They make too much on commission on selling and buying them.  (On that note, how can you short sell these?  It plummets to 20cents means you probably lose all your money since no company around to pay you.  Kinda like THE BIG SHORT movie at the end)

There's multiple stages of this law. First one was telling financial institutions that if they didn't report Americans that they would be slapped with a 30% tax on all USD business thus really dealing a death blow to said bank or financial institution.  
Quickly everyone realized this law was a massive pain to deal with.  Many foreign banks just banned Americans. It was more efficient than worrying about how to comply.  
Then THIS happens and this is why it should be considered unconstitutional.   The treasury department would enter into a deal with Mexico or Canada and those counties would make rules for their banks to collect information on Americans. USA would deal with just Mexico and not every one of their banks.  
Some countries fully comply and others on their way. I find it hard to see how the treasury department all by themselves can enter into these deals without a treaty ratified by the Senate.  This law it taking on serious power of its own.  All to collect a minimal amount of tax.  
If you have tens of millions or billions I have a feeling you could find one fake passport from any of the 200 countries on earth.  Or you could get legit citizenship.  Banks suppose to report if passport is Mexican but says born in USA but I wouldn't be shocked if they dont do this part. They would see a Mexican passport and assume all is fine.
Dumb law.  Unconstitutional enforcement. All around disaster for the states.

Blockchain.info thunder network won't be centralized. If it was so then would just use their servers to do Blockchain.info to blockchain.info transfers. 
This is what Coinbase currently does. If person A sends to person B on Coinbase.  That is just an internal Coinbase transfer and not on any blockchain anywhere. That of course is centralized.

I originally got Bitcoin 18 months ago when I bought $3000 worth.  
My first Bitcoin Transaction I tried to send $25 to Protonmail and accidentally sent $2500.  
I didn't cry or freak out.  I contacted Protonmail and explained the problem.  They sent me back my money including my original $25 and then asked me to re donate if I still wished to.  
I sent $500 instead of my original $25 as I had just assumed my money was gone and I fully respected them for doing the right thing.

Never ever use a wallet with Bitcoin buying built in.  Always transfer to a wallet that does not have this feature. 
Otherwise you're liable to lose your Coinbase or other account due to your wallet activities. Coinbase monitors ALL your transactions and can easily report these to the government.  
Blockchain.info doesn't know who you are. Get a protonmail account and sign up for blockchain.info. ONLY use Coinbase buying and selling.  Never use as a wallet. Get your coins and move to blockchain.info or another wallet that doesn't use KYC.  
Be smart and you'll have your Coinbase account for a while. Otherwise they will shut you down.

If 1% wasn't enough.  Why not up to 5%.  If you lose all the customers you're in same spot as you are now. If you keep half you still earn.  Lose nothing and only gain.  
Reason can't be economics.  Has to be political.  That's the problem here. That's why the disgust.

I would disagree.  Because of stocks a 1000 to 1 "split" would make sense to a lot of people.  
*mBTC = $4*.  That's a unit people understand for their day to day 
To say Bit = .4 cents is better than the current system but to be a fraction of a cent will just be confusing to others. 
4 bucks is simple. I can see a lot of people buying to 10 or 100 mBTC that will not buy 0.1 Bitcoins.

10 days is just beyond unacceptable.  I honestly don't understand how all thee companies don't have an hour maximum response time.  
This is coming from someone who runs a business responding to support tickets.  One hour is plenty of time to get back to someone.

The USA constitution says all treaties with foreign governments have to be ratified by 2/3 of the senate.
We now have treaties with foreign governments on the country to country level of FACTA.  
You can call it streamlining but they kinda forgot an important step here.  
Now I'm fairly certain that not many care and this law will probably not be overturned. 
As far as economics go.  The more difficult you make something to use, the less people will use it.   When the USA is convicting people for bribery halfway actress the world solely because they used the US Dollar, people are going to look for alternatives.  When the US is making it harder to use their currency by drowning people in paperwork they will look for alternatives.

FACTA is the worst law.   And it's unconstitutional.   The constitution specifically states only the Senate has the power to retire treaties with other governments.

This is the worst part about Bitcoin. I can tell you that only white males are welcome to your exclusive and exclusionary club.  Bitcoin is so similar to the KKK.  
You see, my Mom was born in Cuba.  Then she moved to the USA and met my Dad and they had me.  
Not thinking about this "white male" club, I ignorantly bought 80 Bitcoin about a year ago.  I was so excited.  Stupidly I never even thought about my ethic heritage when buying these coins.  Obviously I'm racist against myself for forgetting that I was obviously a victim since I'm not fully allowed the white male privilege and should be given apologies daily from these honkies.  (Since I'm half I should alternate between apologizing and getting apologies, but I won't get into the details that none of you white people would understanding not living through my horrible hardships)
Reality soon hit me dead in my brown face.  40 of my 80 Bitcoin just won't move.  Totally stuck in my wallet.  
I'm so thankful for my Dad's race (while always remembering my half white privileged nature). I did get to spend some, but Bitcoin is the most racist invention ever!!

If they ask you for verification you maybe shouldn't have to do it but that is NOT the company's fault.  
You shouldn't have to do it but blame governments for this.  Not companies.  GoCelery is complying with the laws. Now I don't believe in those laws but we must follow them until we can change them.

I'm not a fan if this.   You picked the $13 mark but if you pick another time this throws the chart off.  
My thinking is it is a free market with no rules in inside trading and anything goes.  No precedent. Don't know if governments long term will regulate or make illegal.  
Lot of open questions.  My guess is Bitcoin goes to $30,000 but it is possible to plummet to $100 if China or USA ���� Make illegal.

There is no "current price" just whatever each exchange has. Since Coinbase is in the USA it's the hardest to cash out of.  USA has most strict rules and regulations and paperwork.

1.  Buy Bitcoin at Coinbase or LibertyX
2.  Move said Bitcoin to Blockchain.info
3.  Send Bitcoin where you want

They don't have a vision.  Circle Bitcoin business grew 50% in 2016.  Why would you ever stop it?   Zero logical reason.  
If the cost of KYC was getting too high raise the %.  They charged like 1% (baked into the price).   Goto 3% or 5%.  
Even at 5% would still be best option (only option) to buy with debit card and get Bitcoin immediately in the USA.  Everyone has a debit card.  That's why this was so solid.   
People pay 7% at ATM.   I'm sure peeps would happily pay 3-5% to sit at home.  
This was a political decision or emotional decision based on the CEO hate of Trump or Goldmen desire not to get involved in Bitcoin because of Trump. Timing too close to Trump winning for that not to be the reason.

Google "Bodog didn't pay me" and then google "Bookmaker.eu didn't pay me" or "Pinnacle didn't pay me"
Trust me. Bodog isn't as legit as you think.  If you win betting sports you will first be dealt a different lineset.  If the line -5 then you'll get -4.  Then they'll cut your limits huge. Then they'll cut you off. 
The above facts are admitted readily by the company.  Just ask live support.  They won't deny it.  Ask "If I'm a professional sports gambler and I start to win will you cut my limits?"  Ask "if I start to win will you give me a different line than others?"
Not sure if you do poker or sports. But bookmaker.eu never cuts your limits and always pays.  Americas card room always pays.  If you're not an American PinnacleSports always pays and never cuts limits. 
Why would you ever mess with BoDog?

Mods can either ban someone to just block/delete a post.  So I think an argument can be banned.  
I rarely see logical informed anti-Segwit arguments.   I have read them on other forums and media.  *I happened to fully support Segwit*.   But I don't blindly do this.  I listen to both sides and then make a decision I think it's the most logical.  
As far as bigger blocks, I find it frustrating that Bitcoin is going to split over what seems like a trival issue to me. I do agree we need a smaller Blockchain.  I've downloaded core and it takes FOREVER.  
Having said that I believe cheaper fees need to be put on a much more important priority than they are. I'd pick cheaper fees over smaller Blockchain.  
If someone disagrees I'll defiantly listen.

You want a USA illegal sportsbook to get approved for an app with Google or Apple?   Trust me they would love it but ain't happening. Think about this.  
But anyways you're insane to bet at Bovada. They do not pay if you win and they deal multiple Lines depending if you bet favorites or underdogs.  
As I said. If you win you WILL NOT GET PAID. Hundreds if not thousands of examples if you search the web. Sportsbook.com same thing. They don't pay.  
People think "they have a website" so it must be legit.  It's unregulated.  Pay attention to sportsbook review sites before you throw away your money.  
Goto Bookmaker.eu or Pinnacle.  Solid spots that pay regardless of what you win.  Win $1m and get paid.  
I know this from personal experience plus knowing many people.  Goto sportsbookreview.com or another review site that doesn't have Bovada as a sponsor.  
Do some research. We don't need government to protect us consumers. We must do research ourselves.

Fairly amazing. I don't feel there's an app that does this internationally.  If there is I don't know about it. 
My most important thing is to make it EASY. The difficulty level is most important.  Much more important than the fees.  Even if high fees (5% or less to exchange from Bitcoin to Fiat and vice versa) the key is making it simple.

Use blockchain.info for anything less than a Bitcoin.  No one is ever hacking you for that tiny amount

Blockchain.info will use one lightning network for all their wallet to wallet transactions.  Then anyone else on this lightning network as well.

I believe the "rules" should be crystal clear.  Some questions regarding those rules. 
---If someone is pro bitcoin but for bigger blocks should their arguments be banned?
---If someone is pro Bitcoin but anti-Segwit should their arguments be banned?
For me, I'd like to read these arguments and then decide for myself which side has the superior arguments.

Good post and especially like the part to invest and not worry if goes to zero.  
Only point I strongly disagree with you is Bitcoin not being 20K in five year. I fully believe 20K or higher is a totally reasonable valuation.  Even at 20K were not even at half a trillion in total Bitcoin.  
The total savings of all on earth is like $250 Trillion.  Apple is worth over $500 Billion. If Bitcoin takes off with countries putting a billion or 2 in Bitcoin in three reserves I don't see $20K being that far off at all.

--They're so big they can't even do their own KYC manually they actually automate the process.  Possible computer made a mistake. 
--government even hints they have extra paperwork due to one of their clients and for sure that client is gone if government asks 
--liability they can't ignore like sending directly to the darknet markets.  Or receiving from darknet markets and then cashing out 
--large large transactions as a personal account.  Maybe if corporate account they can justify but for one person?   Maybe easier to let it go.

There's an entire economy some of us use. I do believe in Bitcoin for philosophical reasons but I also use for practical reasons as banking in Latin America is a nightmare.

Just because someone goes on Instagram and shows a bunch of hookers or attention seekers doesn't mean they have the mind of money he wants you to think. 
Show me your account balance with $100+ million and then maybe I'll become a believer. Even then he can still lose it but should last a few years.  
Not sure what your bankroll is but it's amazingly simple to spend money on the USA. Look at all the athletes that go broke spending tens of millions after a few years.  It's way easier than you think especially when buy ins to poker tournaments are 10k a pop.  
There's a running joke in the poker community on when we'll see this guy broke. No one even heard of Blizeran until his little instagram run.  
I give Dan all the props in the work for finding a ninch and promoting himself but I wouldn't be surprised if he only had a few million.  And he ends up dusting that off trying to act like daddy big nuts. Seems the same story over and over with poker players.

It is better than fiat if it imposes less control or constraints.  That's like saying one fiat where you have to fill out a huge amount of paperwork isn't better than another.

Can't compare the two at all. MtGox was a nightmare. Now we're distributed.  Many say china controls 90% of the market but I focus on trades that are charged a fee so you know are not manipulated.

From what I understand Coinbase only looks at immediate first transfer. Not the 2nd one. 
Simple. Goto another web wallet first. THEN use that wallet to send to whoever.  
Don't know why people don't do this. Coinbase needs plausible deniability and you're giving them none.

Most of us originally began with bitcoin due to its trustless system.  You can trade in system without having to have faith in an inherently flawed governmental based system run by humans.

Sounds like you trade at Bitfinex and then move coin to Coinbase to cash out.  I would definitely goto a web wallet and not do transfers directly from Bitfinex to Coinbase.

Let me know if I have this right. In your job if you see ANYTHING don't you just immediately write up an SAR?
I mean. If a guy comes in an off green shirt and that color seems odd, shouldn't I report it?  You can't get fined for over reporting, but you can for underreporting?
Am I wrong?  Basically AML is searching for as many irregular things you can find and report every one?  Have you ever seen something and thought NOT to report it?  
Maybe I'm dumb but I'd think you'd run out of people to report on.  Most people just do normal banking. Have you seen people make up things to report just so you have SARs to file? Or so many people depositing $9999 that it's not an issue?

@_date: 2016-12-23 19:09:36
They've got 5million accounts.  No idea to know if this was a "person" or automatic machine that shut the account off. 
Could have been a mistake.  
What did you do with your account?  Need more info that "no good reason"
One thing I know is people who transfer funds directly from Coinbase to known dark market addresses or sportsbook addresses can get their accounts shut down.   
Always always always send to blockchain.info or another wallet immediately after buying from Coinbase. Then mix your coins for .05% at bitmixer.io.  Then send to dark market or sports book or poker site.  
Never send direct or use Coinbase as a wallet. They tell you their service isn't meant for this.  It's meant for buying and selling.  Not using them as a wallet which is just pure stupid to do so.  Just allows all transfers to be tracked and can get our account shut down.

Wrong.  They're a financial company. They need to do KYC and AML.  
In addition every transaction you do is tracked and easily handed to the IRS or government anytime.   
This is in contrast to Blockchain.info which only has your email.  If you're smart and signup at Protonmail then there's basically no way to find out who you are.

It could be a mistake so it could be for no good reason.  
Or the government could have been asking questions and it was more work to answer the questions and easier just to shut off the account.  (This happens a lot I'm sure)
So could be for nothing wrong.  You're assuming Coinbase is acting logically.  Coinbase is so massively huge with no competition.  Who knows what is happening with them.

If you want to buy Bitcoin easily you have to do KYC and AML.    Fill out those forms and the government is so full of everyone's information. They can't arrest everyone.  
Then move your Bitcoin to a wallet not using KYC to do your transferring.

They had her winning with 64% probability.  They had her winning electoral college and losing popular vote at 1%. 
Trump winning popular vote and electoral college at 25% and Trump winning while losing popular vote at 10%.  (That's 100% total)  
You can see the obvious tell that if Trump wins very good chance he loses popular vote.  Barely anyone even mention Trump could win without popular vote but Silver had numerous articles on it.  He also said the last week it was tightening and the 90% plus projections were crazy.  
He even used the "F" word in a tweet against Huffington post for their criticism of his work for saying Trump had even a remote chance.  Huffington post and others said Silver was nuts for his 65% projection.   Silver was the closest of anyone to saying Trump would win.  Even trumps own campaign thought they had it lost.  
Find me another person who actually used state polling analysis to predict a Trump win.  
Silver repeatedly said Trump needed Michigan to win and how if he was advising Trump he'd recommend Trump to goto Michigan and Trump was super smart to go there.  He also said Hillary was stupid to go to Iowa and Arizona because she only wins Iowa and Arizona if she blows Trump out anyway.  
I bet Trump also for a lot at 5 to 1 on Election Day.  I did so because silver had 2 to 1 and thus I felt I had the best of the wager.

Coinbase has to comply or shut down if they lose.  So I'm not huge in agreement with you there. 
On the IRS I fully support you.  They're acting like gangsters in rejecting this.  The goal shouldn't be to "win" if you're the government.  Maybe we all forgot but the goal was suppose to be to do the right thing.  
If you read their rejection of this guy they are no focused on the right thing.

If these numbers are true (which I doubt) it just shows how his price is gonna skyrocket.  Only ways Bitcoin doesn't skyrocket:
 USA and other countries declare its illegal to use.  Shuts down all exchanges. This would massively hurt Bitcoin and all crypto currencies.  Prices would plummet
  Another coin like ether or Dash take over and that coin skyrockets and not Bitcoin. 
  Some country creates a crypto currency as good as Bitcoin as we trust them to protect our privacy (Singapore?) and they stay out of transactions like they do cash.  
I really think none of these 3 will happy.  On our way to$10,000 !!!

However the question is are bigger blocks a negative?  I don't understand how they are.  I want to but I don't. If a company is stopping bigger blocks for financial gain that's something the community should look into.  
And this company probably wouldn't want others looking into this.

Exactly!   Of course this time it's 300 to 1300 so we'll see what's next. But last time a lot of people had faith in Bitcoin because of B2X.  Now?   Now we know bitcoin is high fees forever.  Core has had 2 full years to fix the issue. How long do they need?

The more we integrate the less of a chance anything happening.

How nice you were able to say your opinion.  Ain't it nice?   That's how open and honest conversation works.  One person says I believe this and this is why. Then the other side explains their thoughts.  
Then the readers can decide or ask more questions.

Ha.  90% don't have a clue.  I know people that still don't understand it. Many thinks there only 3 coins on earth because that's all Coinbase has.

Bitcoin is digital gold for securing and saving wealth.  It's name value is huge. It's name brand is known.  Adaption is huge.  It's the most decentralized crypto on earth.  No one owns bitcoin.  
Bitcoin Cash is just like all alts in the fact that it has cheaper fees and faster transaction times.   
Those are the main positives of each.  Both will be used moving forward and the fantastic thing is everyone gets a choice now!   Big blockers can use BCH all they want.   Segwit supporters can use Bitcoin.  B2X which one one supported is dead.  
Win-win-win.    Read up and study the pros and cons of both.   Don't listen to one Reddit form either r/bitcoin or r/btc because both are bias for their option of course.  Try to get a neutral opinion.  Be informed.

You really need to read up more on Bitcoin Cash before you ask these questions.  Basically the entire premise is Bitcoin Cash left because they're against segwit and lightning.  You ask whose gonna run it there.  Obviously no one.  They don't feel there's a need.  They make a good argument.  You really should understand it before so strongly being against it.   
As for the other three questions. I liked them. I would propose answering them all. But about BOTH core &amp; cash. Whose running Core?  How many are employed and whose their employers? 
That would make me happy and help me to decide what to do moving forward.

I want to change the world as well. But Bitcoin is up 30x since I started investing.  So by accident I have a chunk that I have to be a little conservative about.  
But as far as B2X losing.  Their stated goal is to be similar to a community supported Linux version of Bitcoin.  That sounds pretty good to me.  
Core has done some great things but they were way way too slow to move on this scaling issue.   We've known since 2015 issues were coming.

What I said is a fact.  There's a market out there begging to pick a winner. They want Core to win but Core won't take the reigns. Outside of r/bitcoin and Bitcoin dot org. Basicallyany spot that allows defending opinions, the majority are against core decisions.

Yeah.  Just like when i bought at $227.   I knew it was going sky high then too. But you probably would have told me we'd NEVER get to $1000 like everyone else said at the time.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:39:25
This is a poor guy that individually lost 600k and he's cool enough to share his story in the hopes others avoid his fate.  I don't believe he should be chastised.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:06:04
He's a Bitcoin Cash supporter.  He didn't see any light.  He's happy B2X is dead.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:55:01
Google "my fee is too low" and you'll find a site you can pay $10 or whatever and it will make your transaction appear in the next hour for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:06:51
Wow.  You need to open your mind 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:36:33
Download Core.   Back up .dat file and compress into encrypted zip file.  Keep said .dat file either on multiple USBs or on encrypted storage online like Tresorit or Spider Oak.   You could add an additional encryption layer on the online storage.  
Your bitcoin is safe as long as you pay the fees. Even in the case of a break in on the storage the hackers would need 2 passwords to break in.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:07:35
We need an emergency fix.  I just sent 4 bitcoin and it cost me $40 and took 38mins to get one confirmation.  Does that sound like the future of money to you?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:13:04
Simple. I just sent 4 bitcoin.  Cost me $40 be took 38mins.  Do you really think that's the money of the future?  
Another example.  I live in Latin America.  We transact in their currency. Now I don't want a lot of it but since I live here I always have some of their money in my accounts. 
That's how usability and tech matter to market cap
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:54:44
There's a huge contingent that supports Bitcoin.com. I think it's good the way it is it. I personally enjoy their news section. 
Bitcoin.org number one 
Bitcoin.com number two.  
Seems reasonable to me.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:03:13
I felt like I was supporting Bitcoin. Long confirmation times are bad. But high fees are a killer. It makes Bitcoin unspendable.  
Bitcoin has not accepted that it's an asset class.  But companies like Bitpay and Coinbase and merchants will look for another solution to serve their commerce.  
You just can't pay $5 to send $100.   It's not reasonable.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:33:27
I don't think you're making him feel better. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:28:49
I don't think anyone is pulling out fully.  They're switching to Bitcoin Cash.  Obviously as you can see from the market. 
No one worried about the price drop.  But it's scary at the same time of Bitcoin Cash going crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:50
It has the name "Bitcoin" in it and way more community support.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:27:39
Funny. You're the same guy that told me we'd never get to $1000.  I predicted $2500 end of 2017 and everyone told me I was insane. You'd have been one of them.  
Let me clarify.  Unless governments smash it or another crypto takes over, bitcoin is going to $100,000.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:52:46
Bitpay.com.  Use them.  They automatically cash your bitcoin for dollars.  Zero risk.  They charge 1% 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:53:14
Super cool comment.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:38:28
So Roger Ver and the evil men are not manipulating this then?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:26:42
Removed?  I was told only r/bitcoin does this.  Never know r/btc to do this.  If true I'd like to know 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:32:02
How much longer?  What are the developer's names?  Why don't we go into more detail on this except to say Core is wonderful and infailable?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:28:39
EXACTLY.  This is why Bitcoin Core matters. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:22:20
Isnt that Jesus?   Dont think Judaism recognises Jesus as anything.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:34:03
Pay the fee
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:10:51
It will for sure. But these geeks will never go for it 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:20
Exactly.  You're 100% right 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:26:22
I earn bitcoin at my job.  I did buy a lot under $500 so it's hard for me to buy more now. But I see no reason to sell any.  
I earn from my job and then spend those bitcoins to live and save the leftovers.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:25:38
Wow.  You're ballsy
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:59:05
So you're saying you want high fees? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:03
Totally different world now.  No B2X.  There's two worlds and two choices. Either you want bigger blocks or you don't.  
One is faster confirmation times and cheaper fees. 
Other is more focused on decentralized and all the other things Bitcoin supports.  Higher fees is seen as an acceptable short term consequence in favor of second layer solutions like lightning network.  
Personally I think if LN works it could destroy every other coin.  At a minimum Blockchain.info to Blockchain.info should be lightning network stuff but I've yet to see it happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:40
You're right. But you always would like to see companies act ethical.  So I'd like to see Coinbase releases bitcoin cash this week.  
I mean it's possible Cash overtakes core by the end of the year in price and already has in hash power.  Confirmations taking 30mins and fees higher than ever.  
If it's an attack or what, really doesn't matter. Those are be facts and the market will run to another option. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:33:02
So no confirmations for ten days?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:23:26
We'll see in two months. So far it's been a whole THREE DAYS since it's become obvious Bitcoin Core won't scale and will continue with high fees and slow confirmation times.  
Let's give it some time.  Personally I think both coins will be $5000 come new year and 2018 will be the battle royal
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:56:41
It's a huge deal. Should be prominently displayed and logical adults would be asking themselves what they did wrong to lose such an iconic and talented developer.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:49:01
Not really. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:08
Wow. Wow.   Why?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:27:46
Well... to be fair BCH has been around for a few months and BTC been around for years.  I think a better comparison would be in two years time.  
Obviously if Lightning comes and works as advertised then BCH could be left in the dust.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:58:12
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:09:11
Market seems to be agreeing with me.  I hope you're right.  I do.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:54:46
Exactly.  Facts.  The world needs Bitcoin.  The world is begging for Bitcoin.  The use cases are endless.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:02:24
I really don't think so.  Nothing about this collapse showed any signs or organization or manipulative planning.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:04:30
One of those critical mass things.  I agree with you but Litecoin never got traction.  It was valued at $50 in 2013 and barely gained since.   
I just don't see Litecoin is a long term solution.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:28:00
17 euros?  If that is an issue you don't have enough Bitcoin to make it worth it 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:27:29
It will last.  Just a matter of how many people leave.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:59:40
Bitcoin will drop 20% in a day probably soon.  But long term it's going to 100k for sure.  Especially once we wake up and use mBTC as out basic unit. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:53:09
Look at both today.  Day one after the fork cancellation.  You tell me it's only Ver transferring funds.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:54:45
I hope you did your research and didn't just drink the kool aid.  People want low fees.  Period.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:30:56
Funny. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:27:07
I use Core
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:33:05
It felt like the NYA defiantly pushed Core to do something.  May have happened anyways but we've been waiting for the lightning network for years and still waiting.  
Core moves super slow and it drives me insane.  I want Bitcoin to succeed.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:29:48
No one has better decentralization than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:34:50
Not to mention insane fees.  Off the charts.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:50:36
New account 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:45:36
Add in BCH and BTG and you're over 8k. Assuming you held bitcoin prior to Aug 1st 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:05:47
Well.... let's hope he didn't two days ago.  BCH doubled and Bitcoin down 20%
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:54:04
Just keep both and see what happens. Once December 1st comes it should be obvious.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:23:03
Why dump b2X.  What if they win and b1x dies?  Then you lose everything.  You're such an expert you can predict the future?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:27:44
That's all it is.  But that's a major difference 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:23:26
So hour long blocks if we retain 20%  ok.  This was the answer I was looking for. If you posted that as a new thread I think it would clear up a lot of confusion.  
Not sure why others not talking about this. 
It's good to know that's worst case scenario.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:56:40
Depends on the wallet.  If on core you backup the .dat file and then recompile the Blockchain on another computer using BTC1 instead of core.  
I did this with Bitcoin Cash (BitcoinABC) it ain't that hard.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:50
How do I use it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:24:47
Everyone should read BOTH r/bitcoin and r/btc.   
Obviously by reading the market today their side has a lot of people following them and it's essential to understand both sides of the argument. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:34:57
Community support.  Massive backing and now the realization that Core will never solve the block limit 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:57:58
I can't see how he's wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:51:33
My guess is it's still there
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:32:01
That is the one reason why this fork dying is great.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:54:07
Today is proving you smart and OP dead wrong. Only one day so we'll see.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:45:39
What?  You need to study thus. That is 100% false.  This is the major division.  Segwit vs Big Blockers.  Bitcoin Cash guys wanted lower fees with faster confirmations.  Bitcoin guys want decentralization above all.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:51:01
What?  If core proposed doubling the block size you think the MINERS would stop it?
Also, can you have a discussion without name calling or putting people down?
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:13:55
Or switch to BCH right now. That's our problem.  They're saying the flipping is coming and BCH will be the main Bitcoin soon 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:56
Bitcoin Gold core wallet.  Will come out tomorrow or Monday.  Then exchanges will announce they're accepting deposits. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:30:18
Don't think contentious.  I've seen zero disagreement.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:41:21
Plz say you have a lot left 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:57:15
You're nuts man. Why not wait until December 1st to see what happens?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:35:19
Obviously many many people disagree with you.  Look at the market last two days.  Lots selling all their legacy Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:24:45
The block subsidy is slated to last until 2040.  Fairly close to "whenever"
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:25:38
Yup.  Voted down. NOT banned. NOT taken down. People over there been trying the same thing posting here and they get banned or post taken down.  
Don't you see just based on that it makes you wonder which side is right?
Edit:  you got 20 more up votes than down votes.  Still care to crap on r/btc?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:38
You got balls.  I'm hanging into both and Bitcoin Gold.  Combined they're 8k.  I have no idea what the market will do but I don't want to lose out picking the wrong side.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:29:37
You're nuts
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:36:28
Uh....No.  They support B2X and said if B2X dies they'll support BCH
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:26:29
How do you feel now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:16:21
I'm keeping both and riding it out.  I'm not gonna think I'm smarter than everyone.  Keeping my bitcoin gold and B2X also.  Once things become more clear I may make a move.  
Core implementing lightning network or other scaling techniques and actually doing them and not talking would be huge.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:39:28
I don't think they can move the entire Korean community. No.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:06:18
I wouldn't say delusions.  Bitcoin and B2X are about to have an unprecedented war. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:44:56
How do bigger blocks cause centralization?
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:47:49
I never did understand this.  Why Bitcoin Cash was needed when we had Litecoin and all the other alts.  
The truth is the Bitcoin name is just worth so so much.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:45:19
I talk to Bitcoin Cash people and they want 2x to fail for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:40:10
Trust me. If governments start to ban it, the price will plummet.  All institutional money will run and that's becoming a huge % of the money in Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:39:12
We name Roger Ver and all the "evil" people but we don't name the names behind Bitcoin Core ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:32:53
You should believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:31:06
Is no one missing the fact this guy was banned?   Really bad if you ask me.  We need all voices.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:04:29
Take out the Koreans money and BCH still have same volume to legacy Bitcoin.  Obviously last 24 hours have been strange. 
Tomorrow will be key.  If we goto $3000 and $5000 then next day is $4000 and $4000.  Then panic will set it.  
All Core has to so is agree to 2mb blocks and Bitcoin price will skyrocket.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:29:27
I did the same thing.  
Was hard to see how that many companies and miners got together and agreed to do something and not do it.  
I also did it because I felt like if 2x did go through it was possible the original chain would die or have hour blocks thus crashing the price.   
I know everyone on r/bitcoin has monolithic thinking but this didn't seem dumb to me.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:30:23
Unless 2x wins.  Why not wait a month and do nothing?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:34:49
Without the big companies and miners it doesn't matter.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:02:39
Major names have come out and supported it.  Bitcoin.com supports it. Companies that want cheap fees will be much more apt to use BCH than Litecoin.  A lot has to do with branding I will admit.  
r/btc is for sure bigger than Litecoin.  
Most importantly as you can see Koreans are obsessed with Bitcoin Cash.  Especially now that Bitcoin Gold failed.  Koreans are driving this rally.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:33:11
Fees are high. Need to pay.  You selling?
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:37:41
Bitcoin is not about cheap fees.  We're digital gold and this isn't the worst thing.  Other coins (which I can't name thus be banned) have taken on the banner of cheap fees and faster confirmations.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:47:27
We've been saying this non-stop for years at the top of our lungs for anyone who would listen.   I've told all my friends since the crash in 2015 this was going to happen.   
Once in a lifetime opportunity. And still we're now just getting to the point where institutional money can how finally come in.   It's basically impossible not to go to $100,000
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:30:23
Dude.  Core has had two years to address this issue.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:37:06
It seems BCH and BTG are taking market share from bitcoin.  Maybe this phenomenon will pass. Maybe there's enough for everyone but with BCH at $1300 and BTG at $400 someone holding a coin prior to Aug 1st, now has a total value of $8000 combining the three coins. Pretty strong. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:27:40
So the Koreans are 70% but it's also Ver?  Maybe an evil combo of the two?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:54:36
Is this the mBTC symbol?  I've never seen it 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:29:11
Could this be a conflict of interest? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:32:13
For those that saved their GOLD and CASH they've done better.  We'll know more once Coinbase releases them.  But combined that's an additional 2k for every legacy Bitcoin you own.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:04:54
No one is saying they're gonna dump all their bitcoins for Litecoin.  Or many are not. Many people are doing just that right this moment trading all their BTC for BCH.   Major names.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:11:05
Support from Coinbase, Bitpay, and many other companies along with majority of the miners.  But unlikely to survive?   Please explain your thinking.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:20:00
In fiat the reward is going up. Not down. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:38:44
Their software is super slick.  You can just use a VPN.  Sign up an email on Protonmail.com and poof you're in. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:18:45
Depends how much you have. Ten or less bitcoin I think you're fine.  Anymore I'd keep in hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:18:12
Super smart plan. It's BCH though. 
Bitcoin + Bitcoin Cash + Bitcoin Gold = $8000
Just hodl and see what the market picks.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:49:26
Depends on your wallet. But if you own your private keys you can get your bitcoin gold.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:28:13
Expect to get downvoted 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:45
You're fine then.  Don't over think it  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:03:33
Wow.  Really great comment.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:15
What?   Right now it had 4x the capacity of Core.  That's the definition of scalable.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:35
Sounds like you've thought it through. I really think the market never trusted Litecoin as a real alternative.  They do see BCH as one for whatever reason. Merchants will start to accept it more &amp; more.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:10
Exactly. So idiots saying Roger Ver is manipulating something need their heads examined.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:47:52
Started the week at $300.   They've been a currency for a few months and we've have years and you're changing your mind based on a few hours?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:48:32
I can.  Some people are not like that.  Others have to cash out after winning $500.   I have zero desire to cash out at 7k. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:26:13
No way. No way.  Can you prove this?   I was told that only r/bitcoin banned users.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:26:57
You thought it might be a scam so you still bought 400mBTC?   I feel like you shouldn't be conflicted.   In the future in life make a choice and stick to it. Don't half ass it
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:39:53
One main job.  Lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:45:52
XXX is up way more than 50%  (funny you say XXX and not BCH)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:50
Bitfinex and HitBTC are the main ones.  But Bitfinex has a more accurate price reading.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:34:37
Fees are high. You didn't pay enough 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:20
While they're testing the communities and businesses may move to another coin.  That's the downside and you can see it happening today.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:14:42
Did it go lower?  If it did I missed that 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:11:48
Valid.  I suppose it does depend how likely you expect either of those to happen.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:10:35
This is why Donald Trump never apologizes and never changes his mind.  If you change your mind if apologize people just bash anyways.  Better to stand firm even if you say 2+2=5.   
But I don't believe this.  The man changed his opinion.  Got cold feet. Whatever. It's done now. Be happy. Don't shit all over him.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:21:44
Companies that rely on Bitcoin for their everyday usage would be crippled and would run.  Don't think we want this.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:57
Did you not look at the market?   BCH up 60% against Bitcoin today and up over 40% against the dollar.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:41:08
Plz tell me you have a lot left 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:23:59
Can you explain why?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:33:34
Will be hard for them to follow through. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:13:44
Only 21 million bitcoins.  Means if you own one that you're in a group only a max of 21million people can ever be in 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:30:11
Tomorrow it is.   And it's trading at $400
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:04:51
I agree fully.  However that's not the world we live in.  It doesn't explain why you think 2x will fail
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:24:25
If he did two days he did quite well. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:28:52
Exactly.

Even if 50% what does this mean for original chain?  Do we need emergency fork to change POW or no?

I know your post is 22hrs old but I hope my response slowed you down.   
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:46:04
Then how do you like that explanation?   Your explanation makes more sense.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:25:12
Not if you're against them.

No one has issue withdrawing Bitcoin? . Just take out Bitcoin and goto another exchange. Best part of free market. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:25

@_date: 2017-04-25 02:32:14
Of course. Just wondering the procedure before I recommend this to anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:12:24
I agree. The safest to me seems to backup Bitcoin core on a safe machine and keep the .dat backup file safe. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:54:36
It will never happen. I hope it does but I don't see it 
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:33:25
Depends what you mean by US.  If you mean dollars then lots of them. Almost all have $2500 lifetime limit.  None of them will mail to US addresses though. 
If you want to cash out your Bitcoin and stay under the radar the best way is to SPEND your Bitcoin.  Use for Amazon, CheapAir for flights, and Expedia for hotels.  
Unless you're going for more than 10k this strategy works well for many people.  
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:41:56
It's hard to buy a lot of Bitcoin. 50 or 100 Bitcoin. Less than 1 Bitcoin is simple.

Based on the past
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:38:25
Yes.  Both of those defiantly have conflict of interests. 
So now that you agree there's a conflict if interest it's time to see what Blockstream wants.  Why they want it.  Because what they want may not be the best thing for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:38:48
How long did it take?
@_date: 2017-04-08 04:21:33
$3000 if we do nothing.  $5000 or more if we figure this out regardless of what decision we make.  
Long term by 2020 if we don't figure this out Bitcoin could die.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:40:36
Super impressive. If you got debit card deposits you could take over all of the old circle.com business. 
But seriously you've done an awesome job. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:54:46
Thank you clearing this up.  Most of figured you'd be smarter than to bank in the United States but glad to hear.  
Just a heads up.  Silly to fight the USA and pretend it's a functioning democracy with independent courts.  Better to find another bank to deal with and stay as quiet as possible.  
Respect for making a statement.  But in the end business wise you'll never win taking on the Americans.

You don't have to pay anything until you sell your coins in the United States.  Spending coins counts as selling. Bitcoin is property.  You can buy $5m in Bitcoin and you pay ZERO in tax.

Can you buy Bitcoin with that fiat and withdraw just fine? Or buy tethers?

Kraken and Shapeshift maybe is new. I know for sure they've been on Bitfinex and Poloneix forever. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:06:10
If you don't trust them why not just withdraw Bitcoin and forget about them?  Go to another exchange to get fiat 
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:01:04
Use it if you want and don't if you don't want to buy unless they're scamming people you should hope their business succeeds.  
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:47:16
Maybe if not an American. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:54:36
I was working on a similar website to help Americans buy Bitcoin  because I really didn't see many websites explaining the websites on where to buy Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:47:11
Can't count Bitfinex. You cannot cash out there so this number is fake.  Look at Bitstamp or Coinbase.com for real number 
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:28:46

Wells Fargo has to follow US banking law. That law doesn't explicitly explain what they can and cannot do.  It only fines for not following it. 
Thus the banks  are forced to be overly aggressive and hope for the best

I think God started with no fiat and only Bitcoin withdrawals until those stopped also. Wasn't immediate but gradual death. Many declared it wouldn't happen.

Let's stick with A and ignore B. KYC is absolutely not necessarily and immoral and ethical.  However it is the law and we must comply and I do. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:48:24
Not really. Can't count because they're including so much of the price with Poloniex which you can't cash out dollars and Bitfinex which you can't cash out dollars. 
Need to base the dollar price in places you can actually cash out dollars �� 
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:33:28
What's the KYC requirements?  I've been trying to ask and not getting anything from them 
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:41:37
Exactly. Waste of time.

@_date: 2017-09-28 20:05:28
I know it can be secure but I think an issue here is gmail. No one wants to say it but think of how many developers have access to gmail.  Now to mention the 900,000 American law enforcement personal that can request gmail WITHOUT A WARRANT.   
Stop using gmail everyone.  Protonmail is seriously amazing.  No one scanning your mails for keywords. No ads.  And even the company itself cannot see your emails.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:18:16
This is awesome.  Once this no longer is headline worthy I can see a lot more early adopters moving forward to do this to cash out instead of using an exchange which can be a nightmare.  
(For example Kraken just said $100,000 max per year for withdrawals)
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:04:24
Strange to take that as fearful.  Just saying it's convenient to use.  Makes my life easier to use Bitcoin then try to get an international credit card in Latin America.

No you're right.  I can't believe how cheap and fast Bitcoin is now.  Newbies that just started a few months ago are so happy but this is just how it used to be.  
The only proposal at this time is for core team to give in.  Say they're wrong and do the upgrade to 2x before btc1 takes over.  
They stay in control.  They're too stubborn but it's the last effort before they're left in oblivion.  
(Remember if I had to pick I choice Core over 2x)

This would destroy the price of Bitcoin.  I'm as far libertarian as they get.   But trust me. We never ever want this.

I'm saying I don't want any government involvement in deciding anything on the core code of Bitcoin.  
I do think 2x will increase the value of Bitcoin big time.  These companies are rock solid especially Bitpay.  
But I'd rather have a less valuable coin and one free from government influence.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:06:40
Protonmail can't read your emails.  They give law enforcement the limited info they have and if you're a child molestor they shut off your account and block your IP it seems.

Damn.  I've been on the side of segwit2x the entire time. I love Bitpay also.  
But wow oh wow. This absoltuly cannot be allowed to happen.  The fact that a lot of them in the USA make a this worse.  
Jesus.  I so hate this argument.  Can't the two sides make a deal?
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:23:44
Bitcoin Cash has to be manually turned on in settings and is off by default. 
Instead of basking Bitpay, maybe thinking about what we did wrong to get a company that was so anti alts just a year ago to switch.  
We didn't listen when Bitpay and Coinbase complained about fees.  The fees were insane.  These companies were not going to stay in Bitcoin ecosystem paying $1 or more for fees.  We had time to fix and we ignored them. Then core updated to version 15 shutting them out on purpose.  
No one should be surprised by any of this.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:40:25
Dude.... Coinbase and Bitpay.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:48:11

@_date: 2017-09-30 17:11:28
2x will win.  Core knows this. Why do you think every article on r/bitcoin is about this now?  If they were not worried they'd ignore it.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:07:08
Hehehhehehe.  Price alerts have saved my sanity.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:27:54

How is this an actual article?  So basically he makes money selling horrible advice. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:39:48
I don't think the miners should have any say in anything.  They want short term profits. Not the long term benefits for the coin.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:06:23
If Bitpay runs BTC1 which will be the new client. It's possible the bigger Bitcoin gets that government pressure would ask them to roll back a block because hackers from North Korea stole bitcoin in a situation.  I don't want this ever. 
Government always starts off small and reasonable. First income tax was 1% on richest only.  Now you see what it is.  Government creeps.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:14:10
China has been threatening this for years.  So not really expected.  Fairly crappy.  Hope the exchanges are back in early 2018
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:07:02
It's a trade off.  Hardware wallet had good things until Trezor or Keepkry decided to download a malicious update and steal all the Bitcoin.  Or less nefarious they just have a huge hole only a few know about.  
My recommendation is USB key is the best for bigger amounts.  Small amounts under 10 Bitcoin really are not as essential and can keep anywhere. Blockchain.info is fine even.  
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:49:13
Lot of people on POLO and BITTREX switching to Tether and then they'll buy back Bitcoin once drop done.

Wow.  He really said that?  That's awesome 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:43:18
I still don't get it.  So how does replay hurt you?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:08:35
If you're investing such small amounts it just doesn't make sense to play the market like that.  Just buy and hold unless you have a reasonable amount.  
Probably would earn more money if you took the time you spent on trading to do anything else.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:31:34
It would ruin us. Let's just hope never happens.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:52
Only 3% but yeah.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:09:10
That's all that governments can do.  And it's a huge deal.  Don't underestimate it.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:21:16
Bitpay is the easiest so he can have auto converted to dollars.  Otherwise he can be a mam just open up a Blockchain.info account and start!!
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:11:11
Bashing those working for freedom isn t helping.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:43:05
Yeah.  Replay protection seems like a no brainer. Any reason not to use it?
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:22:52
Our government gives away so much money it's insane.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:31:16
Bitpay has contributed a ton of open source tools to the community.  Coinbase only seems to take but both have been instrumental in adoption of Bitcoin.  
Both allow me to pay for my flights in Bitcoin.  My hotels in bitcoin.  My Amazon in Bitcoin. 
I don't want to lose this ability.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:33:59
Their company blows 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:07:30
You'd hope. I don't think they see what's coming.  You give people way too much credit.  We'll all know soon enough but my bed is they're reactive and not proactive as you insinuate.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:10:42
That money can be a lot harder to get back into the crypto system then 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:17:10
TY for info.  I'll be checking this out for sure 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:52
Only 3% but yeah.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:15:22
Why are you here?
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:44:57
Isn't the ideal way to do this to have multiple clients?  
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:34:59
Could be.  I don't understand the negative of using replay protection and using a different address scheme.  Bitpay is testing a new address scheme with Bitcoin Cash right now so I assume they'll do something similar with BTC1
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:53:21
It would undermine the argument for BTC1.  It's brilliant.  I know core is too boneheaded and stubborn to do it.  
But seriously no way BTC1 would take over.  It might be an alternative client but that is it.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:28:43
I agree with you but he has a scary point about the government pressuring executives at Bitpay to change the code.  
That scares me.  I was with Segwit2x and probably still am but that's a strong counter argument.  
This isn't is not black and white. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:07:42
No way.  That's awesome 
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:22:36
Uh....might be?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:01:08
I dunno.  I'm feeling this way.  This sucks.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:18:50
We don't want this.  Losing Coinbase and Kraken and Gemeni won't kill bitcoin.  But it will get be price to drop to $500 and crush adaptation.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:43:52
Or you can just withdraw your funds and do what you want with them.  That's the beauty of the crypto world.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:06:44
They're all going to 2x man.  If you want to use an exchange you got 2x to deal with.  The sooner you realize this the better off everyone will be.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:52:24
Is it he most secure full node wallet still?  
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:52:11
So many people use the default of Kraken with this app.  They never change it. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:43:20
EXACTLY 
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:30:54
This is not a real dip.  I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 3k

@_date: 2017-09-06 05:30:36
Uh.....what?  Centralized means a single point of failure. Think Leeman Brothers.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:42:32
Outside of the states they always do mm.  I have no idea why.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:11:52
Google it, but it's basically a company that said send me money and I'll give you digital tokens worth the same amount.  So if the company falls everyone holding the tokens is screwed.  
But for whatever reason so many people use them.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:58:56
Did you read the post?   The ones in charge are in the United States.  They get paid from companies that run license in the USA.  
I've been curiously impressed with Bitcoin Cash and 2x.  But this shit changes everything for me.  The government always abuses their power.  Always!
Besides why take the risk?   We can't have this.  This pisses me off so badly. This does make me consider selling.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:12:33

No offense but you're incredibly naive about banking.  I have a tremoundous amount of experience and doesn't matter what's correct or moral or logical.  
These are banks trying to follow American laws that make no sense and give no guidance and then fine these companies millions of dollars if things don't go the way they like.   
Trust me. Tons of horror stories in guys that had a $100,000 in their daily bank account that got frozen because they sent a $5000 wire there.  
I'm trying to help you.  What happens if you setup a new account and have no problems?  You lose nothing.  But if it will get frozen or cut off you're gonna be awfully happy your other money is safe.

Exactly.  So many novice users think Coinbase is bitcoin.  My family and friends I've gotten into bitcoin buy $50 a week and leave in Coinbase.  
The amount of a few thousand is too small for them to take time for a hardware wallet. Until you have at least one Bitcoin doesn't seem worth it. 
Many others like this at Coinbase.

Bitcoin has changed my life.  I got into Bitcoin and still in it because of the moral and ethical reasons.  To fight the evil of the banking system.  
But it's hard not to get caught up this year 2017.  When I first started I bought in at $227 in 2015.   All year we stayed in the $200s.  I would go a week without checking the price.  If we went up $15 in a day that seemed crazy.  
How times have changed.

@_date: 2017-10-14 21:01:09
Ignore the $5500 number.  Most people in bitcoin don't own a full bitcoin. mBTC is worth $5.50.  A bit is worth .55 cents.  Any of those units can be used anytime.  But they are don't matter.  
**All bitcoin is worth $90 billion.**    Bitcoin is a worldwide accepted currency that's gaining users daily and can't be touched by governments.  That means less paperwork, less time for acceptance, and less arbitrary freezes.  It means you can buy and take possession of a $50,000 car at 8pm on a Saturday from an out of town stranger.  
The entire point is you dnt have to trust any one. $90Billion is not a lot in the world for a system that cannot be corrupted like governments and government currency. $90B is not a lot in the world of finance.  
Bitcoin trades just a few billion a day.  JP Morgan Chase CEO just said they move $6 trillion a day.  Over 1000x more and that one bank in one country.  Bitcoin is worldwide.  Americans are only 25% of the world economy and going less daily.  
(Another reason Bitcoin is so amazing is the massive restrictions the Americans place on their currency. Iran, Russia, Cuba &amp; North Korea are not allowed to use it. You think they don't want a replacement?)
China might ban bitcoin exchanges but person to person trades are made daily.  Can never stop those ever.  Besides Japan, Korea &amp; Singapore gladly accept.  Russia might out restrictions but Ukraine won't.  Etc, etc. 
As long as some countries accept and you can change for fiat somewhere this currency will continue to grow!!

You're absoltuly correct.  I never said it was nightmarish call for alarm. However it's one of those things were I'd rather not have an SAR than have an SAR.  So mouthing off to the banker wouldn't have been my course of action.  Assuming you have any privacy rights against your bank not a wise course to follow.  
Sidenote --&gt;  SARs show the idiotic system we have. Banks just file anything as an SAR so they never get caught with their pants down, and get fined by the feds.  See we're policing our customers!  SAR!  SAR!
So now this overloads the IRS since these SARs obviously have to be reviewed manually.  If the govt just did things less obtrusivily they'd get so much better results.

Interesting news about the plea. Still an insane plea of 22yrs when he never sold drugs and the biggest drug sentence anyone got was 8yrs.  
The two main investigators were criminals and this was not allowed to be released in court. I can't get over this.  
Police protect their own.  For someone to actually get indicted and convicted so fast they were massively blatant.  My guess is others were involved as well.  
Also, the way the feds got into the server has never been proven.  
The sentence of life is just crazy for a non violent offense.  
This case just stinks.  Anyone looking for 5mins should know this.  
On another note, I do believe dark webs do a service to society and consenting adults should be allowed to buy drugs if they do wish.  But even outside of this our criminal justice system was seriously mismanaged here.  
If you're a drug dealer and the head investigator steals your drug money, don't think you think evidence collected by this investigator is tainted?   Seriously?  Does the defendant have any rights?

In theory you're right. But Bitcoin will be run by developers who are beholden to companies who must live within regulations of the USA.  
Americans will use terror as the first excuse to roll back a block or freeze someone's coins.  Then it will be money laundering, and before you know it soon KYC and AML will be required and only permissions clients will be allowed on the Segwit 2x chain.

It's super easy to use and don't need to ask permission or fill out paperwork to use your own money.

Ill check it out.  Obviously assuming you can pay with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:59:18
Two issues here.  Taxs and money laundering. This is assuming you're in the United States.  
Regardless the bank will report one or multiple SARs (suspicious activity report) to the IRS. 
But if you file every dollar deposited and pay the proper tax I think you'd be left alone for taxes. 
Money laundering and conducting business without an MSB (money services business) will likely get an investigation started and an undercover buying bitcoin from you and then they will arrest you and indict you.  
Of course it depends on so many other factors. Which state you live in. How aggressive the investigator is that get a your case.   Also what other items you have on your income tax and what other businesses you're involved in. 
If you have a ton of other legal business dealings than $400k really may not get noticed that much.  If this is the ONLY business dealing that's worse.  
I also never mentioned it you do this in your personal bank account or form a corporation.   Always better to form a corporation always.  That creates an entirely new entity and another layer of protection. Still may get into trouble but extra steps always beneficial.  
Remember from the time of the last deposit to the time they investigate would probably be years as well. 
I'd recommend doing it legal of course. Form a corp and get the MSB license for your state and file all KYC and AML for your clients.  Then file all appropriate tax.

That's like saying your website down due to DDOS.  No one cares.  Fix it.  Get DDOS prevention so your website stays up or you lose your customers.

This is beyond ridiculous.  And this guy is probably squeaky clean. Because if you did anything including smoking a joint or speeding ten years ago you can't ask for anything from the police back.  
These advocacy groups on purpose only take the cleanest of the clean on.  90% of people just go on and deal with the fact their money was stolen.  
Otherwise you'll get fined or arrested for SOMETHING.  We have so many laws in America they'll fine something.

Let's say you're the head developer of Trezor.  You decide to send an firmware update but it's malicious.  Either you don't post the update to github (tell the public it's coming) or you just post it (who reads those anyways)
Now the firmware sends a signal back home and replaces all sent Bitcoin with your personal address.  Or you're able to steal all the Bitcoin there.  
Maybe you get fired. Maybe you get legally in trouble but either way you've just made $100 million at least. How much is Trezor company worth?  I promise you the money they're protecting is worth way way more.

Did I say this was right?  Did I say I agreed this is how things should be decided?   No I did not.   
I believe in decentralization strongly.  I've experienced things that have taught me we need this to be trustless.  
However to pretend 2x won't win is fantasy land. So we should do something instead of writing "pretty please" and hoping they stop x2.  Let's upgrade our system so fees are cheap and transactions are fast.  And make sure everyone knows it.

That's impossible to use fiat to crypto without the government.  
What we need is a system where fiat isn't needed.  Right now I can book my flights and hotels and Amazon with Bitcoin.  With my bitcoin debit card I can do most of the rest.

This is your right but I really don't think BITPAY is the enemy. Also think we should wait until after fork to see how this plays out before freaking.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:05:07
This is the entire argument for bigger blocks.  Some agree.  Some don't but we must lower fees. They're insane. 
Bitcoin core wants to make bitcoin a "settlement layer" so smaller transactions done offchain on 2nd level systems like the lightning network.  
Bitcoin Cash wants to do everything all on chain. The negative of this is the Blockchain will be HUGE and maybe hurt centralization due to fewer people running nodes. 
B2X seems to want a combo of the two.  
That's my .02 but I'll get all thumbs down because everyone hates every one. It's like explain the different sides of tax cuts or gun control or immigration. No one is happy unless you're siding one way or another.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:33:38
Depends how much Bitcoin you have.  Once you get a decent amount the best plan is to take an old laptop and put Linux on it.  
Once you hit $20K or so.  Otherwise just keep on blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:46:33
Bitpay and Blockchain.info and Coinbase are the most important companies to me in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Without those three Bitcoin wouldn't be nearly as valuable to me.  I use it daily because of these three.  
I am assuming I'm not the only one. So instead of looking at Bitpay as bad maybe we need to ask ourselves what happened for us to drive companies like this away and maybe we can work on an agreement as long as it doesn't violate our principles.

This means cash will be outlawed. The definition of an anonymous transaction.  
I disagree they will outlawed.  I believe there will always be a way with crypto, gold or cash to make anonymous transactions.

Trust me. Should be MUCH higher.  Quick history was you probably know all this.  We started and skyrocketed from $50 to $100 when real trading started.  Getting under $100 was super rare and few did.  
Then we took off from $100 to $1000 as we should have. MtGox stalled all our momentum at the end of 2013.  We were skyrocketing as should have been.  Then 2014 dropped all year from $1000 to $200. Then 2015 we sat at $200 all year sue to that.  
Took us that long to recover from MtGox. Then 2016 was our turnaround.   So now even now end of 2017 at $5000 you're getting in super early.

Absolutely.   Don't forget it's your right to use your money how you want.  The government says you can't play online poker or gamble on sports.  
Bitcoin gives you back your freedom.  Awesome story man. Good for you.   
Don't forget to never use coinbase even as a pass through to Trezor.  Setup a Protonmail.com email and use this to sign up at Blockchain.info.  
Remember unless you have your coins in a setup where is you lose your password then you lose your coins then they're not safe.   Blockchain.info let's you store your own keys.  
One day your coinbase account might get flagged and shutdown for using it for online poker.  Happened to many many people.  Blockchain.info won't be shut down ever.

Gmail has ads.  Computers scan your data to give ads.  To test they will read individual emails many times to see if their scans are working properly. That's a for sure on Google end. 
On the government end. Are you trying to say Gmail is safe and secure from law enforcement?   Or your saying you trust American federal,  state and local law enforcement agencies to always do the right thing and never abuse their powers?
Anyone smart enough to use Bitcoin.  Should be smart enough to stay away from gmail, ymail and hotmail.  Law enforcement has a pipeline and reads emails all the time.  I personally enjoy my freedom so I don't use it.

I feel like Linux is superior to Windows on its own merits but honestly the main reason Linux is the better choice when trying to avoid malware and spyware is that these programs are generally written for Windows.  
Windows is 90% of the market.  Apple is 8%  Linux is 2%  there are rough but somewhat accurate numbers.   
So if you're gonna write a script for malware your spend your time writing for Windows.  Maybe Apple as well because even though it's a low % higher net worth people tend to have a Mac.

OMG.  You serious?   Wow!  I seriously could write a book on this.  
I'll try to summarize by saying money should be used as a medium of exchange. Our governments use money as a medium of control.  
The system is built from top to bottom to enhance the power of the elites.   Money is printed and created from thin air from the Fed and given to their friends and pals first.  Interest rates are artificially low thus hurting seniors and any savers. 
That's the general answer but a more personal story. I have a friend whose well off.  He was getting a loan back in 2009.  His company needed $10m at an interest rate of 10%  he couldn't get it.   Then Obama did his money pump.  The guys cousin worked at a financial institution and they were told to get rid of the money anyway possible.  Thus his company got $20m at 4% interest.  
In my one example of 1000000 times where the rich and powerful get ahead at the expense of the rest of us.   
This can't happen with he transparent Blockchain and the way bitcoin is setup.

You're just wrong about a lot of this. Governments don't "protect' their currencies. They want to devalue their currencies by having them inflate.  The dollar is worth 1% of what it was in the 1930s.  
You can use Bitcoin to buy Amazon gift card, pay for flights at CheapAir and Destinia and pay for hotels at Expedia. Overstock, Microsoft and many others.  
An American CANNOT open bank accounts overseas unless you want to fill out a ton if paperwork.  Many banks in Switzerland survived he Nazis but couldn't survive the IRS and have closed recently.  No idea what the Swiss national bank is but I would bet big money you cannot walk in with an American passport and get an account.  
This is all public knowledge. USA is pushing hard on the dollar.  So many restrictions. 
The fact the dark web doesn't use Bitcoin is great for our image. Price keeps going up showing institutional buyers are getting in.  Goldman Sachs is getting into bitcoin. That alone will bring billions more into the market.  
I started buying at under $300 in 2015 and I'm not selling.  You can sell but Bitcoin is going to $100,000 at minimum.

@_date: 2017-10-13 09:20:53
So funny. Maybe you're a young kid or ignorant of both. You have no idea how ridiculous you sound.  I'll copy paste some of my points for Bitcoin for ya. I'll add some flair as well :)
  This is the EXACT same thing people said about the internet in 1994.  Wow!  Computers connecting  I can chat with other people!  Who cares.  
You have no idea the kinds of applications and amazing advancements will be made using Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. Yes it's early but that's the entire point. Get in now is good.   
  You think the big banks and the Fed are and ideal way to run society?  Do you have a moral compass?  Do you read or understand anything about what happened in 2007 ?  Any idea what happened in Greece and Cyprus when ATM machines overnight failed?  Any idea what happened a couple weeks ago when all of Puerto Rico had no banking and no ATMs. Cash only but couldn't get any.  You think Bitcoin may have been useful then?
Just like we were able to avoid censorship with the internet and gain free speech freedom, we'll do the same with Bitcoin and gain financial freedom.  
Cash will go away.  I for one don't want the government to be able to freeze my funds or tell me what I can or can't do with my money.  Believe they can with venmo, PayPal and your bank.  
  I don't go to the galleria subreddit and talk about how art is a waste of money. I may believe that but if they're into then bless them. Love art. I don't.  
I'm not the kind of person that wants to control others and impose my will on them.  I love Bitcoin. Why do you care?  How is that funny to you?   You think it makes you a better person because you're ignorant on this issue?  
It's like the moron in class when he gets asks by the teacher for an answer and he does know so he says "I don't know that!" And smiles and every one laughs.  You're being that idiot. 
Now THAT is a good response.  I'm quite happy with myself.  Good night!
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:48:27
Didn't know it went to r/all.  Shows our reach.  Discount   
I know you read someone say Blockchain good, bitcoin bad so you repeat it but the only reason they KNOW Blockchain is good is because Bitcoin proved and proves it again and again everyday.  Hackers would love to hack and steal bitcoin from the network.  They can't.  
As far the price which matters little to me when fighting evil and doing good.  But looking at bitcoin and saying $5700 is the price is ignorant. We're gonna split 1000x and goto $5.70 soon anyways.  Many business use mBTC as their main unit that deal with bitcoin.   
But that doesn't matter $5700 or $5.70.  **All bitcoin is worth $90 billion.**    Bitcoin is a worldwide accepted currency that's gaining users daily and can't be touched by governments.  That means less paperwork, less time for acceptance, and less arbitrary freezes.  It means you can buy and take possession of a $50,000 car at 8pm on a Saturday from an out of town stranger.  
The entire point is you dnt have to trust any one. $90Billion is not a lot in the world for a system that cannot be corrupted like governments and government currency. $90B is not a lot in the world of finance.  
Bitcoin trades just a few billion a day.  JP Morgan Chase CEO just said they move $6 trillion a day.  Over 1000x more and that one bank in one country.  Bitcoin is worldwide.  Americans are only 25% of the world economy and going less daily.  
(Another reason Bitcoin is so amazing is the massive restrictions the Americans place on their currency. Iran, Russia, Cuba &amp; North Korea are not allowed to use it. You think they don't want a replacement?)
China might ban bitcoin exchanges but person to person trades are made daily.  Can never stop those ever.  Besides Japan, Korea &amp; Singapore gladly accept.  Russia might out restrictions but Ukraine won't.  Etc, etc. 
As long as some countries accept and you can change for fiat somewhere this currency will continue to grow.  
Lots of people said there's no reason for the dot com boom of the late 90s.  They were right &amp; wrong.  Some busted but the ones that made it like Google and Facebook dominated and changed the world.  Get ready for the bitcoin revolution! Jump on board or miss!

First thing to understand.  There's three kinds of markets for Bitcoin Debit Cards.  
--Americans have Shift and Bitpay card and I believe that is close to it.  
--Non-Americans have a ton more options including the two above.  
--There's a new category for Europeans as many cards are going Europeans only now.  
This is due to the insane amount of requirements that our government puts on the dollar. For foreign institutions to have the privilege of using the dollar they must report on Amercian citizens using their product. Tons of extra reporting.  So many cards just see it's better business to ban Americans than deal with all that work.  
Since BTC-e went down it's gotten worse.  ADVCASH.com  won't even allow someone with an American IP to visit their site.  
Vast majority of Americans don't even know this stuff happens. This is important because all this nonsense makes Bitcoin even more attractive to Americans living overseas.

Anyone can make a fork anytime they want.  This is open source software.

It will be a house of cards and x2 will be the dominant coin.  I personally don't see a way to stop it and a million Reddit articles about some random tint company in Argentina who says they are backing out of 2x isn't going to matter.

The thing is this was a boon for us.  The bitcoin community. It was the first sign that governments treated Bitcoin as somethibg of value.  
It also showed the way to sell then.  Auction them off.  
The rest of the world follows the USA blueprint so blindly.  Recently this copy/paste attitude has worked against us and works against freedom but this was one time it really helped.  
The world saw the Americans say "Bitcoin is valuable.  Bitcoin is not explosives. Not cocaine. It's legal and ethical and moral to trade it"

@_date: 2017-10-07 18:49:53
As I said we don't know.  The market seems to think so since B2X is only worth 30% of a bitcoin and the original chain is at 70%  but this is only on a couple million dollars. 
If Bitpay and Coinbase stay strong and call B2X the real Bitcoin then no I don't think consumers will lose with it.  I think the market will take off.  
Legacy Bitcoin won't die because they'll do an emergency fork to lower the difficulty but it will be more a nitch product and B2X will be the main bitcoin. 
This is all highly speculative, but also a real possibility.  If you're only getting your info on r/bitcoin you're gonna have a slanted opinion. Just like if you only go to r/btc.  Both sides have valid points and hotheads.

If some terrorist get a caught cashing out at coinbase some bitcoin someone sent him from the middle East.  This is my greatest fear. 
They government could shut down Kraken, Coinbase, Bitpay and Gemeni overnight.  
The price would plummet 50%  if other governments did the same we'd go down even more.  
We'll never goto zero and it will always be around and SOMEONE will always cash it.  But if we want it to go to the stratosphere we need to hope governments leave us alone.  
Seems risky to me.

Listen.  Understand the issues.  Goto r/btc and understand the other side. Don't have ignorant.  It's defiantly possible if 70% of the bad power abandons the original chain that core could have problems. 
That's a fact.  Maybe 2x will die also but no one really knows.  Don't be blind. Hold both coins and be smart and wait for the chaos to pass.

*As I said coinbase can freeze your account*.  Freeze your coins. Happens to many people. If they realize you're using it for poker you might lose access. 
Use coinbase ONLY for buying and selling. Never as a wallet. 
Blockchain.info is an excellent wallet.  Safe and secure.  
You shouldn't be using gmail or ymail for poker either.  Protonmail.com is just as good but secure.   
Simple steps to avoid 100k locked up and you have to explain how you got it.

I'm the biggest die hard believer of Bitcoin there is. 
But the government had no precedent to auction the coins off. They had to create it and this is something governments are NOT known to do.  Trust me, I'm glad they did.  But just because it had value didn't mean it was gonna be auctioned off. 
As I said explosives and drugs also have value but they don't get auctioned off. 
If a different bureaucrat had been I charge I could have easily seen this going another way with the government destroying the Bitcoin, and bad mouthing it's use to all.  
It isn't hard to make an argument that Bitcoin can be mainly used for illicit purposes.   Many have done it. (Of course they don't mention cash has the same purposes)
As far as the government lying.  Open any history book or just read the daily news.  Government institutions lie constantly.  It's in their nature.  We even have a law in the USA that if you lie to a federal law enforcement officer it's s felony but if they lie to you then no problem.  So yes the government would tell a bald faced lie for sure.  They also might just be incompetent.  It's not like the government officials get to the put the money directly in their pocket.

Well maybe to the die hards on Reddit but hate to break it to you. The people using bitcoin that I know are using it because it makes life easier.  Wiring is a nightmare in Central America.  Banks are a nightmare.  
Bitcoin is simple and easy.  And they all interact with Coinbase and Bitpay weekly if not daily.   Those two companies are the backbone of making bitcoin useful.  
Not to mention Bitpay amazing backend open source tools.  Their mobile wallet being the best in the entire ecosystem.  It's probably been forked 100 times.

**Money should used as a tool for exchange. Governments use money as a tool for control.** You play by the rules, you're allowed to you use their money. You don't and you're done.  
In addition many mistakes are often made.  You accept cash and decide you deposit $9000 in the bank four times because you're not doing anything wrong but why fill out extra paperwork by going over 10k unless you have to?  
Then you find your life savings frozen for structuring. Maybe you get your money back in 18months.  Probably get a lot less back after lawyers fees.  
What about when the government freezes the wrong people's accounts?  Either by thinking you're guilty when you're not or because you have the same name as someone 
I formed a company.  The name was similar to a Mexican drug lords name.  I never heard of the OFAC but every time I form a company I now have to check it against the OFAC database to make sure I don't match up.   
I couldn't do a wire or any transfers without taking an hour with my bank. This just isn't a practical way to do business.  
Now with FACTA if you're an American living overseas you pretty much are locked out of banking.  In the country I live in, you cannot open a bank account until your a resident.  Well, you can't be a resident until you've been here a year and show 60k in bank account.  
And once you can you have tons of paperwork to deal with.  Very first thing every country will ask you when you open a bank account is if you hold an American passport.  Sometimes they'll open the account with severe restrictions and severe paperwork requirements. Sometimes not at all.  
Let's say you live in Brazil and want to pay someone in Turkey.  You have to exchange Reals for Dollars.  Then Dollars for Lira.  You think that's cheap?  You think that's a simple no paperwork process?  
Or you can click SEND and send them bitcoins.  The way money should be.  
Bitcoin are also good for bad things.  Buying weed, or medicine without a prescription. You think Mexican drug lords or sellers on the dark web create more violence?  You think ordering weed online delivered to your house is safer or more dangerous than going to the street corner and buying from a random guy with no reviews and no history of selling a good product.  
Let's say you take a bribe for the world cup.  You've never visted the USA in your life but you take dollars for the bribe. Now the Americas arrest you for something they have nothing to do with but.... but..... you used their currency and thus must follow their rules. 
Governments also cheat with their currency. They all print more than they should.  Americans get away with it only because their the world reserve but they won't be forever.  Other countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe or Cyprus or Greece.  You think they want to use their currencies?  Even the last two have the Euro but what does it matter if you can't get your money from the banks?
The dollar is being inflated away.  Seniors that saved their whole lives have dollars that earn 1% and are worth much less than they were when they worked for them due to the inflation tax so governments can reward their corrupt rich friends. 
**How can you see Bitcoin NOT taking over.** How can you see Bitcoin which has a mathematical formula for making coins NOT more fair and honest and just then the dollar or other currencies.   
You trust your dollar. You code with ether.  I'll be using Bitcoin or if another trustless non government currency comes along I'll happily use that as well.  I don't care if Facebook or MySpace, it was the internet that made it happen. So if Bitcoin, Litecoin, DASH, or another, as long as it's for freedom and allows human beings to trust each other and know that our money is honest then I'm all behind it.

Price is not high.  Go to coinmarketcap.com.  Bitcoin is less than 100 billion dollars total.  That's nothing in the world of finance.  Just Apple is 7x that.  That's one company.  Bitcoin is a whole new way of conducting transactions.  Anyone with half a brain can tell crypto will be over $5 trillion in the future. 
Great comparison is the web in 1994.  Many said what a waste, what's it good for, to chat with random people and a boob after 3mins of download time?  No thank you.   No one knew about smart phones. High speed internet.  About YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.   But intelligent people knew the web was gonna be huge and the future.  No one know which apps would take us there but we knew it was coming.  
The dot com crash did happen in last 90s and we will crash too.  But not before we run this up much much higher. Bitcoin will goto $100,000 and then drop to 25k in the crash.  That's possible.

About 16.5 million bitcoins in circulation.  Satoshi is 1m of them.

In addition it was just $1000 back in April.  The high run up is scaring people away.  
But 5x is nothing.  DASH was $10 start of year and is $290 now.  Ether same thing up 30x this year to date.

Coinbase is a business and they can choose to support whatever coins they want. Core has plenty if chances to fix this over the years and they didn't.  Instead they stalled.   
Can't expect a business like Coinbase to put up with $1 fees to send bitcoin.   Besides....whatever coins Coinbase supports will be valuable just based on Coinbase.  Let alone Bitpay and many others.  
I wouldn't be surprised to see $10,000 prices by end of year adding up 1x and 2x and Bitcoin Cash.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:55:45
I cannot understand how 2x cannot be more valuable than 1x by end of the year.  Unless 2x falls apart or make a deal before.

@_date: 2017-10-01 04:50:23

First of many people stopped playing online poker when the government banned it. (Assuming were talking about USA government in 2006)
Second of all, that's a desire to do something.  Something addictive no less.   People will strive to do it. 
Bitcoin is really an investment for 90% of people buying it. Not for me. For me it's a way of life.  I use it, get paid in it. Pay others in it, tell everyone about it, etc.  
But 90% of people feel it's an investment and if the government banned it, that would make it super hard to cash out.  People want to buy in and cash out at will.  That's what makes Bitcoin so amazing.  
I'm convinced if we lost Kraken and Coinbase and Gemeni that Bitcoin would drop 95% in value.

The 5 to 1 odds will go up IMO to 4 to 1 or so and maybe 3 to 1 at launch.

Simple answer people.  Use Linux.

Doesn't matter if someone is rich.  Matters if they use that power to control others.  But the truth is individuals rarely control and trivialize society to the levels governments can. 
Governments are the main enemy.  We get less government and we'll get more freedom.

What you're saying is logical and intelligent.  Why Core hasn't come up with this baffling.   
But they'll never to go for it and honestly it might be too late anyways.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:57:21
Ha!  The guy who sends massive replies!! Now says to stop!!
When you can't argue, it's time to name call!
Your response made my day.   
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:11:53
No.  Banning people and saying people are idiots and questioning morals and using words like "attack" don't help us.  
Logical arguments, explaining the issues and even BOTH sides and then why you like yours better is helpful.  
In addition seeing the faults of your own side.  There is no way both sides are peachy clean.  Everyone has made mistakes.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:01:38
The line is .15 so I ain't doing .2
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:43:41
Exactly. These guys that couldn't imagine having 1 full bitcoin criticising this guy just piss me off. This could happen to anyone.  We need better security measures.

Proper 3 letters

Title says Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:33:14
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:30:59
It is.  I'm saying we need a way to incentives people to run nodes. Right now people basically do it to "help the network" and I prefer not to rely on good intentions since this is suppose to be a "trustless" system
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:25:51
It's a million dollars and hasn't been live for 24 hours.  Not horrible.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:27:01
Exactly the same. If you sell or purchase it's the same in the eyes of the IRS.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:03:29
B2X is coming. COINBASE supports it.  Miners support it.  
I'm not sure which is right &amp; wrong but that's the reality. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:43:02
Why the government continues to let them in is beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:42:52
No idea how much it will be.  1x might be worthless by then. Might be $3 billion.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:52:43
It's gonna ruin us. We must figure it out. Anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:44:01
You mean cash transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:48:07
Went up a lot. Tons of people probably gonna cash profits. Seems logical to me. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:45:55
Great explanation 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:28:48
Google 
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:42:30
I dunno. Others say its happened. Governments are not moral instruments.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:05:38
For tiny amounts less than $1000 so many options.  I'd immediately goto Abra. Perfect for 500 a day or less 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:56:46
Volume so low hard to think this means anything.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:06:15
Copay is safer. Same wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:41:26
Are you trying to say the police are morally justified in what they're doing? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:13:26
USA never seized any funds. Just the domain.  So they don't have access.  
Maybe if BTC-e pays the fine.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:50:17
I thought Armory stopped being supported?  Was that another project?  I stopped looking at this wallet due to no developer support but this seems to show a lot of good movement forward.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:04:46
Add ABRA.  For the $500 a day they're awesome. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:32:07
Don't be logical.  USA World Police bitches! 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:19:09
Personally I think CoPay (not Bitpay) is the easiest and most simple way to go for a good amount like 5 bitcoin.  
Just keep the back up phrase and you're more than good.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:22:32
How can they be this horrible?
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:14:43
Why is that funny? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:16:53
Effort is important.  I run companies and the difference between companies well run and poorly run is massive. 
No reason to skip corners. Take an hour and get an email with your personal URL.  Same reason why when you graduate college you stop using SuziSexy69  
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:07:02
USA law is not that way. For people it's innocent until proven guilty.  For property or money it's guilty if they take it and you have to PROVE you're innocent to keep your property.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:34:54
Because we don't have any decent options. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:22:02
USDT or USD requires validation?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:55:26
Actually...what is the incentive to lie?
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:11:31
The domain was taken. Not the company.  You should add a dot com in your header to show the accurate truth.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:04:26
Even when I was broke I understood people had money.  I feel like some people can't comprehend $10,000 and that strange to me.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:33:52
How can they say this nonsense?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:21:20
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:03:39
Does anyone know where the servers were located?
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:02:52
One thing is really don't get is how hosting providers don't just say what happened.  
What country were the servers in?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:29:15
I've seen no indictment for BTC-e unless someone can post for me.  I know they got a civil fine of $110million but indictments are criminal.  
Remember USA treats companies as separate entities so you need an indictment for the owner and the company.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:34:32
Thank you. I'm all for segwit but damn!
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:07:38
Remember what happened 
--BTC-E was not shut down.  Their leader was arrested and their website was taken.  
--No funds were taken. 
So if the company was setup like a normal company with customer funds segregated and a management structure in place then you might get your funds back.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:23:55
What?  There is absolutely no reason for there delays.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:10:58
Yes it is.  .com is VeriSign which is USA.  Remember this when setting up domains. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:55:01
The domain has. So?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:32:49
Lot of companies do. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:15:42
Wow.  Probably in the cloud on AWS or Azure. I'd be shocked if physically in the USA.  Wouldn't think BTCe would be that dumb.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:56:13
Anyone know what country the servers were in?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:24:39
At minimum setup blockchain.info account and move all coins there.  Then mess with Electrum
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:31:15
Uh.... with who?  US government didn't take any accounts or get any funds.  How they gonna pay you?  BTC e should be e their money 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:16:28
Obviously 5 bitcoin is spending cash to a lot of us.   Makes sense to me because if you have 20 or 100 or 1000 or 10,000 bitcoin the amount for spending is around 5 or so for day to day spending.  
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:06:51
Always nice to see a support email    Makes me feel like a lot of effort has gone into the company.  While at the same time I know the operator cares about their image.

Max 50yrs.  He won't get that for money laundering. Fully depends on how much he can come up with.  
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:15:20
That was a lot of work for that 
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:19:42
I don't know what to say. You need to provide more information like what happened.  You logged in one day and they were gone?
