That's the Austrian argument and it's false in every single way.
The human body is a complex system, yet we have medicine and precision drugs. Fluid dynamics is a complex subject, yet we have provable theories and practical applications of them.
If something is complex, that doesn't mean that you can know nothing about it. That's not how the Scientific Method works. If you can do precision math about fluid dynamics, you sure as hell can do it about the economy.

We're both correct. Each of these countries had a wealth of problems of their own linked to bloated bureaucracy, inept governments and waste on all levels. 
However, they were keeping their countries afloat with inflation. When they changed to the Euro, they ripped off the band-aid and now each and every one of them is headed towards bankruptcy.
You could argue that taking the band-aid off and choosing amputation instead (via austerity) actually multiplied the problem and made it much worse. Now they're in a situation where they have to solve complex systemic problems *right now* or face ceasing to exist as a nation.

Remember, the choice is not inflation vs no inflation, it's inflation vs austerity.
And by drastic action I mean that austerity is an entirely different beast. Thanks to austerity measures, there are now 25 million unemployed Europeans, or one in eight Europeans. Greece itself has an unemployment rate of 27.5% or 60% among young people. What the austerity measures have also done is start riots and civil unrest, bring forth extremists and given neo-Nazi parties like the Golden Dawn power and Greece itself is near collapse. All in all, I wouldn't want to live in Greece right now.
If I had to choose, I'd definitely take some inflation instead of all that. For decades Greece could live a wasteful lifestyle *because* inflation was keeping them afloat. With monetary controls taken out, they now must either sink or swim, and they're sinking pretty fast right now.

You've misunderstood then. It's not a question of delay.
Imagine an country (let's call it country A) where a loaf of bread is $0.02, milk costs $0.10 per gallon and a house is $3000. An average wage is $1000 per year. Product X made in this country is expensive, so it costs $500, a six-month salary of the average worker.
Then imagine another country far away. Let's call it country B. Here wages are higher and the average wage is $100,000. Milk costs $10, a loaf of bread is $2, and a house is $300,000. Product X costs $50,000, a six-month salary of the average worker.
It would be much better for merchants in country B to buy products from country A. The difference happens due to inflation - in both places product X costs exactly the same (a half year's salary) but country A has inflated their currency to the point where you can buy ten country A monies with one country B money.
Now, the more country B buys from country A, the more it strengthens country A's economy - wages and prices start going up in country A, until their money is expensive enough that it's not profitable to buy country A's exports anymore. At that point a price floor is found where the price remains. If country A starts getting poorer again, their exports start being profitable again, and increased exports bring them back up to level.

So people in reddit act contrary to everyone else? Why?
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:55:21
You're not seeing the whole picture. If Greece prints more money, the price of their currency goes down. In a downward spiral *this is a good thing.* What it means is that other nations with stronger currencies can now import stuff from Greece much cheaper. It's an equalizing factor - the harder the value of the currency falls, the more enticing it is to buy exports from that country, increasing money flow to the country and propping the value of the currency back up.
You could make an argument that inflation robs everyone, but that's incorrect. The hurt is inevitable. Inflation is the best way to dilute the hurt that the nation has to endure, because it hurts everyone evenly. The other method that has been tried is austerity, which REALLY fucks everything up and usually adds on to the problem instead of solving it. Inflation means you take a hit on your savings, austerity means you lose your job, your house *and* your savings.
OP's dad is right, this is pretty much why most of Southern Europe is fucked right now (Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy etc). They're tied to a common currency and don't have any inflationary controls. They have no pathways to cheaper exports to equalize their budgets, thus they remain in a perpetual downward spiral and have to take drastic action to change their course.
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:20:30
You misunderstand me. I'm not saying austerity caused the problem. The problem is elsewhere, and like you've said, in Italy there's plenty.

Completely incorrect. From Paypal's FAQ:
"It's free to send money in the U.S. to friends and family when you use your PayPal balance or bank account. Fees apply when you use a debit or credit card, or the payment is international. In most cases, the sender decides who pays these fees."
Also, you'll get gouged much worse when exchanging from/to fiat from BTC than between actual currencies, so what's your point exactly?


Name ONE exchange that doesn't ask for ID for large transfers that isn't also deliberately breaking Federal law, namely [the part where you need to register as a money transmitting service or face a conviction of up to 5 years.](

Well, yeah, that's pretty much my point. The problem was never in the currency - in fact, that was what was keeping you afloat. The problem was horribly, horribly bad governance. What should've been done is replacing all of the governing bodies with working ones. Right now Italy has to do it regardless, but what they've added with a fixed currency is a host of other unnecessary problems which could've been prevented.

From a purely monetary viewpoint, with inflation they have one more powerful tool in their arsenal. With a fixed currency they don't. Simple as that. Having inflation is much better than having a fixed currency, because it gives you control over your money.
What the politicians choose to do with that control is another discussion entirely. In Greece, they obviously chose very wrong. One solution to the problem would be perhaps to vote in someone competent once in a while?

Except that if Bitcoin truly undermined the banking industry, they could utterly destroy Bitcoin whenever they wanted. Let's face it - Bitcoin is small game. The Bearwhale incident happened and the price nosedived thanks to a measly $8m sell order. That's what Citibank makes in about five hours. If banks so chose, they have the resources many times over to plummet the price beyond recovery. We'd see just how fast that VC money disappeared if the price went to the double digits. At that point you'd see massive mining pool centralization too and Bitcoin would effectively go back to being the niche drug market currency it was a few years ago.

This is a good thing. It means that you can't hoard money - to get richer, you need to start a business, then you need to expand your business, you need to invest and be productive. Since everyone's forced to do it, everyone benefits from increased activity - there are more jobs, there are more investment opportunities and more wealth created.
In a deflationary economy, **everyone's best option is doing nothing.** This is great for the individual, but once again when everyone does it, everyone suffers. There are no businesses, there are no investments, nothing's happening. Everyone's just sitting on their pile of gold doing nothing. And if you're not one of the lucky ones having gold, you're completely and utterly fucked.

Because deflation wipes out loans. If you loan, say, 50,000 and have to pay back 100,000 thanks to deflation, there's really no way to make that loan profitable. So no to buying a house, no to starting a business, no to doing anything except stuffing money into your mattress. Nobody pays anybody for anything and the economy grinds to a halt.


It doesn't, deflation does. Think about it. In a deflationary economy, if you're sitting on the biggest gold pile, you're getting the biggest share of the gains. *By definition* those at the top profit most when it comes to deflation. Just look at Bitcoin. If Satoshi exists with his million BTC, quantitatively he himself is getting the largest percentage of all Bitcoin gains.

Look, their target market are tourists. People who are wasted, college fratboys and businessmen looking to have a night of drunken fun and looking to part from their money. 
People who go to third-tier, piece of shit low-cost Vegas casinos like Golden Gate don't go there because they have researched beforehand. They go there because they're on the Strip, drunk out of their minds and they see an ad banner on a wall saying that there's a casino nearby which takes Bitcoins. If some of those people get interested and actually come to the casino, they can just say that "unfortunately the Bitcoin functionality is offline at the moment. Here, have this drink voucher and go gamble your college tuition on the slots".
Don't you understand? They never have to offer Bitcoin services, ever. No slot machine or roulette table takes bitcoin anyway. Maybe there's a bored old lady at the cashier's desk who has a Bitcoin machine somewhere in the basement, maybe not. The point is just to get people inside and play, and advertising Bitcoin is cheaper than free drinks or other services that actually cost money.

The real reason is that they don't give two fucks about Bitcoin beyond the marketing boost and getting people in that wouldn't otherwise come. That's why they advertise it loudly but there's zero support once you're inside. It's irrelevant if you pay with BTC or not, the point is you're there.

Which rate do they use? Bitcoins sell at different prices depending on the exchange you're using. Plus if you're selling retail, your margin on the product you're selling can be wiped out at any moment thanks to BT's fluctuation and volatility. Basically you'd have to be keeping up by the minute on exchange rates and insta-sell any bitcoins you get to keep your pricing stable. That sounds like massive overhead.
