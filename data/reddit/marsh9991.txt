Why does this need to be sunshine and rainbows? 
Whether you refer to crypto as a currency or an investment. Why cant is it be discussed on an intelligent level? Not throwing petty insults. 
If you walked into wall street and started shouting noob at everyone youd be kicked out.

I hear alot of people talking about wallets. Obviously, safety is important.  I know a hardware wallet is best - nano ledger etc. At the moment it doesnt make sense financially to buy this due to the amount of bitcoin I have. 
So i have an old iphone i dont use and ive downloaded breadwallet on there. As i dont use it i have the luxury of taking it offline - no wifi, no internet connection. 
Does this means its safe? Ie as its not actively connected to the the web it cant be hacked? Or am i missing something fundementally wrong? Can they access any other way? Ie through a breadwallet server or something? 
Hope this makes sense, Im only a few weeks into bitcoin and would like to stay long term. I dont mind losing my money due to things not working out. But losing it to a hacker is not ok!

Who put you in charge of other peoples decision though? Isnt that part of the point of bitcoin to move away from controlled currency. 
I get it. Your investment is effected. But why does it give people the right to PERSONALLY insult others?

Is that a website? :s

Maybe. 
Its been annoying me for a few days, but I suppose with todays dip in mind you are probably correct!

Thanks for your nice words. 
I see your point. I imagine those troll accounts dont stop but hopefully I and the community can grow a hard skin which doesnt put off genuine people.
