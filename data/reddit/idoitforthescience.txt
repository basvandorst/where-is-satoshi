This doesn't answer my concern either. And the video nor anyone else has provided a simple answer. Don't need it to be dumbed down, but how is it that not using the private key will allow for safe transactions.
The creator of the video is so pro segwit and pro bitcoin, yet, doesn't touch up on this at all.
Also, I hold BTC and sold all my BCH. I just wanted to make that clear, because I know so many of you will think I'm just a BCH troll or something.
I really would like to know how it's as or more secure without the private key

Datadash did this video a bit ago and it was better

I tried searching for it, but surprised no one has made a Saint Judas holding a bitcoin, so i decided to make one.

Haha yeah, he's definitely exaggerates quite a bit and has a strong character while being very hard headed. That's the part of him I don't listen to. At least he's still real with himself when it comes to the technical analysis

I couldn't agree more. Which is why I want to expand on other people's techniques and view point. So far, I've done well for myself in trading, not daily, but have made more than hodling. Hopefully, that'll continue to be the case...

Perfect, this explains it all. Really appreciate it. Ideally, I would like to run a full node myself in the future when I have a spare machine to sacrifice for the greater good. For now though, electrum will have to do. I'll be doing cold storage anyways here shortly.
Thanks again!

I have now read the "questions about August 1? See here." and it still doesn't answer my question.

Sorry, guess I wasn't very thorough in noticing that. I will look for it...
Also, I definitely do not want to get caught up in that. Issue being that I bought about a day ago and waiting for my ACH transaction to clear before I can move it. I would be buying a little bit more if time sensitivity wasn't an issue..
Also, I set up blockchain.info wallet to transfer from coinbase, and then once in blockchain.info, I was planning on doing paper storage since I want to hold long term.
