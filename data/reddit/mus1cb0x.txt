FTA: "Congressman Jared Polis is calling on the Treasury to ban physical dollars in response to Senator Manchin’s plea to ban Bitcoin. “The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss,” wrote Polis in a statement."
"To be sure, the Congressman is being cheeky. “This is just a satirical version of Senator Manchin’s letter, meant to draw attention to the fact that BitCoins are not any more susceptible to the problems that the Senator points out than dollars,” said Spokesperson Scott Overland."

Finally someone said it. I'm above personal insults based on someone's appearance, however I'm not above up-voting it.

Well-done piece. Thank you.

Is ViaCoin better than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:39:05
So you came to a subreddit you don't participate in, and attempted to speak for everyone in attributing embarrassment to those who *do* participate here? 
(And then referring to *me* as "mr point fingers".)

TL;DR: Good chat about Bitcoin starts at 9:55.

I had no idea ViaCoin was a pump and dump coin. It is? It seemed to offer some interesting features when I glanced. While diversity offers a valuable contribution, I also look forward to the effect of collaboration on Bitcoin.

"Don't demonize her." Agree.
"The reporter is *just* the point person." [emphasis added] Disagree. Withdrawing culpability from responsible parties in a matter detracts from the learning experience opportunity, not to mention its contradiction of fact.

"im embarrassed for *all of us*"
And who are *you*? Perhaps you should be embarrassed for yourself.

"Outing gives rise to issues of *privacy*, choice, hypocrisy, and harm in addition to sparking debate on what constitutes common good in efforts to combat homophobia and heterosexism."

I agree. That qualifies as "throwing the baby out with the bath water."

FTA: "The fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange which filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins to hackers, is certainly the virtual currency's biggest crisis.
But data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin industry websites and internet forums shows that more than 730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking, cyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits before Mt. Gox's collapse. That's nearly 6 percent of all bitcoins, and doesn't include dozens, possibly hundreds, of unreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from their computers or online exchanges to hackers."
I wonder what % (and total) of fiat currencies have been stolen or used in crime? It would be an interesting comparison.

Referring to ambush-journalism as an interview is like referring to pick-pocketing as charity.

I do believe there is a responsible way to go about investigative reporting. That was an opportunity missed.

It needs to happen. Distributing exploits by a 'developer resource' such as GitHub is issuing quite a challenge. Who will rise to it, and receive the glory of valor &amp; victory?

Does coindesk accept payment for stories or have they otherwise been found to offer bias at a price? I use them as a news source.
