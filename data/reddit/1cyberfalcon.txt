Reduced demand makes fees go up?? Do you even economics bro?

If the current narrative is that forking with less than 95% is contentious, wrong and is an 'attack on bitcoin', then there's no way you could fork away from PoW in non-contatious manner, as you wouldn't even be able to properly measure the support of community.  
By their own standards, core devs would be attacking the Bitcoin and creating new altcoin.

Why did they even bother to sit there with you for that long if you made it clear that you represent no-one and can't promise anything. That makes zero sense and is not in line with what miners said back then ("consensus reached"). Lost in translation?

Sure, coz entire world just waiting to jump into Bitcoin after LN is launched.  How do you intend to set the blocksize limit then? 1mb will be big enough?

If that happens, you can either accept the attack and live with it, or declare Bitcoin as failure and move on to/create something else.

Sure. Because it doesn't matter for the business whether they earn $20/day or $20,000/day as long as they 'earn something'. Right?  
Go on, inform the misinformed. Show us your workings on how reducing number of txs (potentially by factor of thousands) will provide sufficient incentive to mine.

Governance-resistant or governed decentrally? The former would mean no change is possible.  
What's 'commit access', who grants/revokes it?  
Ps. Could you clarify - can PoW algo be changed without hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:16:15
Who was meant to be in charge? Closed group of devs?
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:04:52
You can't do it without contentious fork. Getting 95% of mining power agreeing to change of algo or moving away from PoW is off the table.  
You're essentially asking for creating new altcoin.

Sarcasm? I can't tell...
@_date: 2016-10-19 18:47:56
Or you could just hire few Chinese crooks, for tiny fraction of that amount, to force miners to perform the attack on your behalf ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:41:53
Or just bought in the nearest store?
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:42:06
And who decides whether your ethical obligations are being violated?

standard boomer-tier reply: "b...but a lot of people who bought at $8,000 lost money"

Nah, they report on both, only 4 days ago:
