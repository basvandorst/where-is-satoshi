Not sure about weight, however, you might be able to measure in btu's, or the amount of btu's it takes to incinerate the U.S. dollars that bitcoin displaced

Lol, just passed it this morning on Millplain

How can anyone take him as a "man" as much as he cries and throws tempertatrums!  
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:58:48
Where is that? What street? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:40:13
All you have to do is Hodl for 80 years! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:07:14
Who do you think you are replying too? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:08:35
Is it possible to prove one's burned their coins?
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:00:20
Hell yes! I bought more, and still holding!
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:07:16
Ha! Ok, I'll have to find some fud somewhere but its getting scares 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:02:42
Ha! 
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:48:52
It's not a scam! I've seen this guy, he drives a Bentley!.... Oh wait, I mean it's a scam! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:29:13
Not implying that at all. I dont think he cares much about scam coins. But if he didn't think BTC was the legit coin, surley he'd dump 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:35:47
Btc validates w out permission from congress 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:02:37
Agreed! But when a new name is chosen, its no longer judging Bitcoin, its judging an alt scam. If players want to use disrabution, let them dual to  death for the name. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:15:38
Sorry to hear... I hope they hold a shit ton of Ver's coins after all that shilling he did for them! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:46:32
What better person than Satoshi to disinsentivize scams. Alts will have to create their own distribution like they should be 
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:19:51
Was that cause of the Bear-Whale? Or after? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:25:44
So go find your own distribution then, Jihan! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:34:21
This move would only control the scam coin. It would though raise eyebrows that those btc coins are owned. Better now than later 
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:29:45
I almost spent 10k on the pre sale but dont feel bad at all. I couldn't buy a coin with no creation limit. I told a friend about ether and he ended up cashing out $989,000.00.....  Bitcoin's turn is comming, not even stressing  
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:12:12
The day they dont think your crazy you'd be crazy to buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:40:14
Why are you paying such a high fee? I just sent a txn yesterday for one satoshi and it only took about 8 hrs to settle 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:02:19
Last i checked all his/hers/thems BTC havnt moved. Satoshi is a true hodler. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:01:11
It was fantastic! Hope I get one more chance 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:37:10
Don't believe any of that crap! Its all FUD! Bitcoins will be worth way more! 
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:44:21
This is in referance to post UASF... Dont say we didnt warn you
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:02:21
Not quite OG status here, but ive been around since 2013. Bitcoin to me has been this exciting since the day i read the white paper. Back then we had Change Tip... Dish, and Overstock accepted bitcoin. And smart contracts were a mind blowing innovation. Looking forward to the next four years! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:44:50
Won't call it the bottom until I see you pull a David Seamen and claim bitcoin is dead... Then ill buy 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:56:07
Tulips hysteria closer resembles USD in that its inflationary.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:11:00
So when you loose your purchasing power FDIC gonna give you up to 250k?
 Detroit homes never went to 0, the owner had shelter. 
The government cant take my Bitcoins. 
Premise should then be BTC better investment than house

Soon to be bankrupt armies 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:45:44
Thanks, and Lucas is one smart cat, but i still have a hard time not thinking it would cause inflation. If money was so fast that all we needed was 1 dollar, how would we not have too many dollars? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:07:59
They prob will, and it wont be pretty... If all major credit cards started moving money as fast as Bitcoin  LN it will most likely cause hyper inflation due to the increased volocity 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:27:52
Whatever you offer ill double! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:23:06
Mind blown! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:43:22
2030? Bitcoin has gone 20x since i bought 3 years ago! Another 20x should be easier to get to now than before 
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:54:48
Funny how so many comments in Lisa's video think Bitcoin is some sort of one world conspiracy. So many are misinformed. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:04:46
Strange... I don't know 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:36:51
Staying in USD is a gamble as well 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:07:25
Your house is insured, USD is not. Your house will never be worth zero while USD can. Not using it loosely, house is not a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:03:36
Simple-   Billions worth have been bought the ticker "BTC" while others bought the ticker "BCH"... Both parties bought into, and chose the corresponding consensus that each coin possesses.  
Therefore, the ticker corresponding with each consensus must remain as each party new what they were purchasing. 
The debate is over language, and the language chosen to distinguish these two has already been agreed on by the purchases. 
This is only debated by wishful and greedy crybabies who want the branding for personal gain. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:20:11
Yes!... And I'd make millions! Gold could be melted and molded more efficiently into such things as Ibeams, then turned to strong structural members that would at least be useful 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:44:32
Which in turn doubled the amount of bitcoin males. So this what network effect looks like
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:22:48
When bitcoin is easy to obtain you wont like the price  for entry

Of all the alts I see the most potential for rare pepe. That's not saying much alts.

Bitmain is not that smart... We shouldn't keep giving them ideas
