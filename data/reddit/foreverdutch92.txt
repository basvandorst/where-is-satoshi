Based on my experience, trading alt coins is a great way to increase Bitcoin holdings. At the end of the day though (figuratively speaking) I am always trading my alts back for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what I trust the most other than exchanging it back to fiat.
Not sure how how this helps, but that's my view on things.

Bitcoin is not a static object, it is actively being improved with ongoing development. Anything useful that some alt coin has as a USP could be added as a side chain. I personally don't believe any other blockchain based cryptocurrency has any real long-term advantage over Bitcoin.
While I agree the current congestion and fees are annoying, they are simply the inevitable growing pains of a new technology.

You can use Bitcoin however you want. Buy a house in Bitcoins and put the transaction in the blockchain or buy a cup of coffee and put it in the blockchain. However, decentralisation isn't free. If you think decentralisation is not worth $9, then either wait for side chains to make smaller transactions cheaper or use a less decentralised coin.

SegWit already allows 2MB+ block sizes.
If you take out the spam transactions and move a fair chunk of the transactions over LN, then I do believe there will be enough room left for relatively fast on-chain transactions.

The current blocksize is not the problem, it's the lack of SegWit adoption by big exchanges. SegWit already allows 2MB+ blocksizes.

We already have bigger blocks with SegWit, which is slowly gaining adoption. Side chains are in the works.

People put up buy or sell orders at specific prices. If many people do this for the same price a *wall* of sell or buy orders is created. Such a wall can block the market price going up when there is a sell wall or down when there is a buy wall. Once the market price hits a wall, it will slowly start eating it away one order at a time.

I think most people expect Bitcoin to go mainstream in the future, which would mean significant portion of the world's population owns Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:38:34
It means no actual Bitcoins are being bought or sold. It's simply betting on the market price of Bitcoin, much like you would do at the races. The money involved with the futures never touch any real Bitcoins whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:24:57
It’s an exchange between buyers and sellers. They simply provide the platform and take a fee for doing so.

Bitcoin itself never got hacked. Check your facts. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:02:08
It's simple. 8MB blocks means an increase of 8 times compared to the current block size of 1MB (non-SegWit). If you switch to 8MB block, that means the block chain will eventually be 8 times the current size. The current blockchain of Bitcoin is about 150GB with a block size of 1MB, so with a block size of 8MB it would have been 1.2TB. Their plan is to keep increasing the block size and 1GB blocks have already been mentioned.
The bigger the blockchain gets, the fewer people will be able to download, store and run a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:19:31


It's not. The futures trading is settled in cash.

Right, so halting trading for no good reason is just fine. You must be blind if you don't see what Coinbase is doing. You don't have a clue what's going on. That 1500 BCH sell wall was reset due to a very convenient technical glitch or so I assume based on your arguments.
Coinbase signed the NYA. That really says it all.

People also don't understand that all futures are settled in cash, not in Bitcoin.
People also don't understand that you need a long position for every short position. 
People also don't understand only a handful of brokers will have access to these futures at this time.
This is not going to be the end of Bitcoin, it's not going to crash either. Wall Street can't magically go short for a 100 billion plummeting the price down.

lol what?
I don't think you understand what futures trading is and how it will be done for Bitcoin. Start reading here:
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:13
Not to toot my own horn, but I did say that. Most people don't understand what futures trading is and even worse did not read any of the details involved with these Bitcoin futures. They are all cash settled and never actual touch any real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:21:40
Basic gist of it:
* Bitcoins are exempt from sales tax (21%).
* Bitcoins will be taxed as equity, just like gold or stocks would be taxed.
* Bitcoins could be taxed as income when running a business around Bitcoins, including day trading. If you're registered at the house of commerce, you'll likely have to pay income tax over Bitcoins.
Not bad.

It's not going to have any direct effect on the price of Bitcoin. If Wall Street goes short for a trillion dollars on Bitcoin, it wouldn't directly affect the price. All it would do is show the world Wall Street has no faith in Bitcoin. If people care about Wall Street's opinion, they might start selling. However I doubt anyone trusts the banks anymore.

You really can’t compare Ripple to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. You already named the reasons.

You gained like $7 and spend $36 on transactions. That's why you ended up with less.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:44:47
Lightning could take another year and even if it's released we'll be facing the exact same issues as we are with SegWit adaption. If they can't be bothered to activate SegWit, then LN is definitely not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:58:20
Yes, if you're doing a SegWit transactions *right now*.
If everybody was using a SegWit already, the fees would be pennies. The high fees are a result of the congestion, which wouldn't exist if everybody was using SegWit.

They can block your access if you try to sell something they don’t want you to sell. Example: you want to trade 100 BCH for BTC but they don’t want you to pull down the market price for BCH. So they block your access.

This was a correction. Those happen in healthy markets.
If the price jumps to 25K in a few days, then we'll see another correction sooner or later happen again.
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I think claiming bubble requires some more arguments. Your included illustration, which has been posted numerous times, does not show any corrections occurring in the bubble's rise. It just shows a bull trap, which could be the case right now, but if its not than the whole illustration becomes pointless in my opinion.

Their scaling method is increasing block sizes as needed. The bigger the blocks, the fewer people will be able to run a full node.

Well one could argue that a whale could have stacked up on Bitcoins these past weeks to dump them while going short. 
However most of the worrying comes from the fact that people don't understand what futures trading is and think it's some secret hack Wall Street is going to use to pull all the money out of Bitcoin.

If you take decentralisation out of the equation, then yes increasing the block size to 8MB or more is a quicker and easier way to scale than LN. But that's the problem with it, it centralizes the nodes.
To be fair, I did not say LN would make all alt coins obsolete. Coins like IOTA are a completely different beast without even a blockchain. However a large amount of alt coins are just basically the same as Bitcoin with some added features, features which LN or other side chains could easily add if there was a demand for it.
That's just my opinion on it of course.

No, but those Futures you are referring to from December onwards are from CBOE and CME and are both cash settled, which does not involve actual Bitcoins. So unless someone opens a short position and simultaneously starts dumping large amounts of Bitcoins on an actual exchange, it should not affect the Bitcoin price in any way,
BitMEX has allowed Futures trading since 2014, which are actually settled in Bitcoin.

No, you don't understand the concept behind hodl.
It means you should hold on to your coins and stop panicking about the price, because it's short term thinking. If you don't believe Bitcoin will be worth more than it does today in a year or more, then by all means dump them as soon as possible. Additionally, if you think you can gain from daytrading, then by all means sell at will.
Hodl is long term thinking. Anyone that bought Bitcoin with no interest in the long term has no place in this space anyway, Bitcoin is still very experimental in every way.

If we assume the recent drop from mid 6K to mid 3K was caused by the Bcash hash war due to players dumping Bitcoin to be able pay for rented hash, then their recent peace treaty should be the end of any further mass dumping.

You seem to be unaware that a Bitcoin is dividable. If people are willing to pay $100 for 0.0001 Bitcoin (or 10,000 Satoshis) then that would evaluate 1 Bitcoin at 1 million dollars.

I understand your point and agree with it mostly, but I have some issues with spending Bitcoin in general. Let me explain. What I usually do is spend and replace. Whatever Bitcoin I spend is immediately replaced by exchanging fiat for new Bitcoin. That way, I get to hold and spend Bitcoin simultaneously without suffering too much from price spikes or drops. My problem however is where to spend Bitcoin. Most online shops that accept Bitcoin are doing so through a third party payment gateway, which is more likely than not going to liquidate the Bitcoin for fiat the moment the transaction is confirmed. That is in my opinion not good for Bitcoin right now, as it only generates more selling pressure for Bitcoin.
