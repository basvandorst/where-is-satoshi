Buying Bitcoin is not buying shares in a company. People bought stocks in dotcom startups, believing the internet was the future, and that those stocks would rise in value because in the future, these companies would make a lot of money and the stock would be more valuable. As these companies are just startups, there is a big risk involved, as it is hard to predict which company is going to make it, and which one is going to fail. (companies like Amazon, MS, Google did end up as big winners if you picked those.) 
Bitcoin is not a stock, but more an asset. There is no underlying company which is producing goods and services and which will reward people with dividend, or increase in value because it has a lot of nice buildings and art etc in them. So some people buy it as an investment, are hoping that more people will want to buy it and the price will go up. It would be better to compare bitcoin to the gold rallies you see once in a while when the stock markets are in for a correction.     
The way they more or less were similar, is that people like to get caught up in these rallies, thinking the price for both assets and stock will continue to rise forever, and they fear of missing out, so everyone will want to buy it, purely speculatively.   
And there are people who think bitcoin will one day become a currency, like the USD, and want to be in early. These people should prefer to have a stable price, as this generally benefits currencies. (you would prefer to be paid in a currency which allows you to buy more or less equal amounts of food every day).

It's not supposed to. You use it as an easy means of trade, so we don't have to run around trading pigs for bricks for TVs.
