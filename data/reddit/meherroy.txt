Killerstorm, how does exchange with Colored Coins avoid this? 
I have seen comments from you on Colored Coins SPV. How does that work? Do issuers re-issue coins periodically?

Thank you. Any particular Bitcoin centered guests you would like to see?

I ll check it out. Thanks for the suggestion.

Looks like we should launch our own coin that incentivizes people to filter out scams from our show. :)
Then allocate 75% of it to ourselves.

I thought they were already put in place. By their own admission, the second and third dumbest people in bitcoin respectively.
Doesn't seem to be an inefficiency we could solve.

We wanted to discuss shitchains in addition to shitcoins, so rejected that option.

Personally, I try to. It's just a different kind of integrity biased towards a view that the future contains thousands of crypto-tokens and one Digital Gold.
Also, I wish the show paid the bills. All Bitcoin / blockchain podcasts are labors of love at the tiny community size we have today.

Thanks for the feedback.
There are a few different schools of thought interviewers can subscribe to. I like the Charlie Rose school which focuses on ideas the guest brings to the table rather than a mindset to filter ideas. Brian is different and has recommended me to be more skeptical; so we are far from homogeneous in our approaches.
We could add a couple more skeptically minded people as interviewers. I ll keep your comment in mind next time we make decisions impacting interviewer mix.
