I'm not certain if 'attack' is the right word here. The battle is between those that wants the Bitcoin network being/staying a P2P network and those who wants to turn it into a settlement network. With big blocks, like Bitcoin Cash, there is less need for offchain solutions. With 1mb blocks there will be insane need for offchain solutions. So who's right? I think both sides are extremely vocal and arrogant. The truth is that _noone_ can tell this with 100% certainty. That is why the Segwit2X is a good compromise. Both camps are slightly annoyed but the network as a whole gets to kick the can further down the road and can actually function while a true solution is developed.
To this date I have not seen one single argument from Core why 2mb blocksize would kill off Bitcoin that is not a value judgement. At the opposite side I have not seen a single argument that the huge blocks in Bitcoin Cash are sustainable.
I'm a _looong_ time Bitcoin hodler. Most of my wealth is in Bitcoin. For me it seems completely reasonable to give users the choice if they want to conduct their transactions through a intermidiate layer, like Lightning, or directly on the chain. At least until one of the methods has crystalized as the best way to solve scaling. If the blocksize is stuck at 1mb we can already see the contours of that it will be impossible to do onchain transactions because they will be too expensive.
Sorry for posting from a new account. I don't want my main account to be banned for saying something remotely positive about 2X...
