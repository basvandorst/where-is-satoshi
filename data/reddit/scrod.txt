You're making a key mistake: Bitcoin does not hold a monopoly on its specific digital features. Bitcoin will hold its value *only if it continues to be as popular* as a digital currency relative to all the other competitors (and I'm not referring solely to the clones). If you "invest" in Bitcoin because of its unique features, then you're basically making a bet on the continued popularity of one particular open source project.

Nope, I wouldn't allow you to take my personal property and I would be justified in defending it. Notice that we're talking about *private* property, which, nearly by definition, is going to require a state-like entity to protect it, as it wouldn't be anything I used *personally*, but rather only employed others to operate. Remember when I asked that you read my previous posts? How about you go do that.
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:38:02
My hand is part of me -- I don't need to classify it as property in order to be entitled to own what I produce. Any other situation would be classified as slavery. In fact, the *only* situation in our society in which one does *not* own what he/she produces by default is precisely when one uses another's private property to produce it. But why is that, anyway? Especially when those productive resources themselves were obtained using the proceeds of others' labor in the past under the same property relations? Ultimately there is no intrinsic justification for this theft of labor, which, through the process of capital accumulation, has occurred in an unbroken chain since the commons began to be enclosed in the 16th and 17th centuries. Private property (as opposed to *personal* possessions) which is used this way -- as an investment on which only others labor -- is inherently exploitative.
And yet, under Capitalism, the vast majority work using private property owned by a comparably tiny percentage of the population, and are denied the full product of their labor.

It may not be hypocritical, but I don't think Bitcoin can accomplish all these goals. In the end, it's still a technocratic system of control; sure, participation is democratic, but the rules themselves have so far been set by a small elite group of developers who started with a predetermined set of criteria of what they wanted to see in society.
But let's put all that aside. The practical implications of a system that works on the absence of trust is that it ends up actively compromising other uses of it that have a mediated trust relationship. This has resulted in countless thefts from security breaches of bank-like entities in the bitcoin world. It makes no sense to operate on bitcoin using anything but a maximally distributed system for this reason (local clients). But it also has social side-effects: online, you must assume that *everyone* you deal with through bitcoins is potentially out to rob you. And indeed, there is massive fraud and theft. When you take away social circumstances and structure relationships purely on economic transactions in a trust-free world -- well, it should be no surprise what happens.

The lack of trust is inherent in Bitcoin's design, and is practically a stated advantage according to its creators.

Your rhetorical simplifications are so disingenuous as to border on propaganda.
What is "freedom"? What is "property"? What are "rights"? You define these terms to eliminate all but one possible conclusion, which makes it impossible for you to reason outside your incredibly narrow right-wing economic framework.
Let's start with property: by applying a single term to a variety of economic relationships, you conflate our natural and innate understanding of *possession* with the feudal concept of [land titles]( To claim that owning the shirt on your back is equivalent to a claim on the goods and services produced by those laboring on a plot of ground on which you never step foot is lunacy. The landed classical liberal philosophers in the 17th and 18th centuries recognized this definition as being particularly advantageous to them. Conceptually differentiating personal possessions from land and other capital which serves the needs of society only when operated in a cooperative fashion by multiple workers, is obvious to all but the most gluttonous materialist.
And rights? Does that include the right to deny others access to the means of obtaining food and shelter on the basis of your use of it as an investment? And how could it include the right to life while not recognizing the right to the basic necessities of survival? By defining rights selectively *and* conflating radically different uses of property, you establish an implicit set of rules that appears to create a moral justification for the hoarding of productive capital and resources on the part of a few while denying it to *everyone else in society*. And how about once you also then combine this particular type of property "right" with a labor market? Then you appear to be arguing for the right to exploit others, because those who lack productive property of their own must sell their labor to those who have it simply to survive, and receive as compensation less than the market value of the goods they produce.
Freedom for whom? In such a society where everything is owned, those with the most capital also have the most freedom. If you have nothing, then you have the freedom to starve, which is not any kind of freedom at all. And a society in which the vast majority of its members have no choice but to submit to the will of those who control access to the means of production is by every definition *tyranny*.
Edit: I almost didn't also notice your confusion about what the *state* (which you seem to call "government") is. If your concern is that people might actually *govern* themselves via a collective entity, then don't worry, you are correct that a "government" is not necessary; it is perfectly practical to let roaming warlords and dictators enforce property rights instead. Unfortunately, such a structure does still constitute a *state*, as it is a centralized entity that enforces a set of rules through violent force (or the threat thereof). Why warlords? Well, what else would you call the people who have the most incentive and means to fund a private police force? These people become the de-facto commanders of a private army that then exists only to enforce their own claims to private property against all those who lack it. And it is in precisely such a situation that the concept of "private property" is exposed for the sham that it is.

Wait a minute, did you seriously just try to respond to my comment by naming a series of totalitarian dictatorships? I can just as rightly call the USSR and North Korea **state capitalist** economies because the means of production is controlled by a small elite class with all profits flowing to the state.
Under socialism (of which anarchism is the purest form), *workers* control the means of production — not the state.


The "right" to prevent others from growing food on an arbitrary parcel of land that no one is using is a demand on other people. This is simply a rephrasing of the right to "private" property.


If you're talking about *capitalists* specifically, then nope — by the definition of profit, 100% was stolen from the workers who produced the goods those capitalists sold, by paying them less than the market value of those goods.


Oh, thank goodness you've finally found the solution to poverty! You'll surely be awarded the nobel prize in economics for this one.


You must be [awfully privileged]( Edit: But the best part is that those in most dire need of food receive it through social welfare programs which exist outside of capitalism. It's largely by virtue of western democracies' *deviation* from laissez-faire capitalism that the most visible instances of poverty can be controlled. You could try to claim otherwise, but then you'd be back to arguing for your theoretical utopia of total private tyranny.

No, those would be *markets*.
I'm going to copy and paste a previous comment of mine, because it seems appropriate here:
    
~~                    ~~
    
You seem to be under the impression that *markets* and *Capitalism* are the same thing. Well, many Americans who lack a thorough education in history and have been exposed to decades of propaganda often make the same mistake, so don't feel bad - you've got plenty of company.
Let's start with your definition of Capitalism, which you claim is *"simply trade of goods and services amongst voluntary parties."*.
First, trading of goods occurs in all *markets* (which have existed for thousands of years). This is not unique to Capitalism.
Does Capitalism involve markets? *Yes!* So why then do we also use the word "Capitalism"? Wouldn't that be redundant?
Capitalism is a term first used by [Proudhon]( to refer to a unique system of exploitation that arose during the industrial revolution, and that has subsequently become the dominant mode of production.
What makes Capitalism unique are two things:
1. The use of land and human labor as commodities, and the subsequent trade of them on markets.
2. Its recognition of *private property* (as distinct from *personal* property) entitling the owner of productive capital to the proceeds of the labor of others paid to operate it.
Second, while markets can be voluntary, the unique combination of private property with commodified labor (which is the heart of Capitalism), gives rise to a system of social relations in which a minority class owns most productive property, leaving the great majority no choice but to sell their own labor for access to that property in order to earn enough money to survive. Moreover, the existence of a surplus "workforce" of unskilled labor gives complete control to the employer to set the rate of compensation. The employer uses the profit he extracted from the workers (by paying them less than the value of the goods and services they produced) to accumulate even more productive property and continue the cycle.
Thus, because the alternative would be starvation, workers are not making a voluntary decision when they sell their labor.
Third, in order to create the concept of private property, pervasive and violent force is necessary to deny access to those who lack a title to it. How else could a majority of the world's population continue to exist with wage-slavery as their only option for survival?
So amusingly enough, what differentiates Capitalism from any other economic system involving markets is *precisely* the fact that it imposes *involuntary* decisions upon people, and in so doing requires, for all practical definitions, the existence of a coercive *state*.

It only took a few dozen people (mining pool operators) to fork and consequently re-join the blockchain, which is the *only* mechanism that ensures the scarcity (and consequently "value") of bitcoins. This happened a few weeks ago, and it can happen again at any point in the future. This event demonstrated the complete ineffectiveness of Bitcoin's distributed guarantees right in front of everyone's face. It's only a matter of time before more people realize the utterly precarious nature of their darling digital commodity, and when this happens, the speculators who have brought the exchange value of bitcoins to its present level will show zero loyalty.
