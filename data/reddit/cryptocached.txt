Nor does it stop being money transmission.

It does not matter that the preimage is independently valuable. The intermediate node only "buys and sells" (i.e. transmits and receives) these value placeholders to effectuate the transfer of value from one person or place to another person or place. That is money trasmission per FinCEN.
This is reenforced by the fact that a contract exists enforcing the forward transmission of value in order to receive the incoming value. This is one of the tests FinCEN applies when considering if the "facts and circumstances" around a particular activity qualify as money transmission.

You can do so because the courier never receives and transmits the value of the instrument.


That is not true at all. They negotiate existing contracts on established channels. They exchange value with one peer for value with another.


A routing node must absolutely have funds on the outbound channel in order to route. When the a transaction is complete, they will have custody of the value transferred on the inbound channel and will have lost the value transferred on the outbound channel.

One does not need to transmit money to be a money transmitter. Any form of value substituting for money is sufficient.




That is not an apt analogy. Lighting Network contracts occur between each peer, not between the route endpoints. It would be as if you wrote a check to the bicycle messenger and they delivered a different check, one that draws from their own account. They would have received and transmitted value, just like a Lightning node.

Hey, would you look at that. I taught this parrot a new phrase!

This is almost a reasonable argument, but it is insufficient to demonstrate that Lightning nodes are not money transmitters. The only purpose for the "buying and selling" of the digital goods is to effectuate a transfer of value from one person or place to another person or place. Receiving and transmitting any placeholder of value (even digital goods) in this manner and for this purpose qualifies as money transmission per FinCEN's application of the BSA.


The reseller of clothes does not do so with the express purpose of facilitating a transfer of value from the down market buyer of the clothes and the bulk retailer. Unlike Lightning nodes, they are not in "the business" of money transmission.

I see the problem. Classic case of garbage in, garbage out.

A pre-paid fee is not a requirement.


The intermediary node is told exactly which node it will need to transmit value to and the precise amount of value it will need to transmit in order to receive the "product." In exchange for doing so, the inbound contract entitles them to a specific amount of value as compensation. The intermediary node is fully aware of the value it is receiving and transmitting.

The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of claims and registration does not imply legal recognition of their validity.
