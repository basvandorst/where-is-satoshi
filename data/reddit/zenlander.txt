It is possible to have crypto in cold storage and also have spending crypto in hotwallets.

all it means is that there is a new market in town (bitcoin) and they are opening a futures market to manipulate it so they can make more money. same thing they are doing to precious metals, commodities and basically every other futures market.

Do you think a massive fiat entrenched bank like GS wants to see bitcoin succeed? Or are they just using a futures market to profit from bitcoin's volatility?
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:01:42
It can be about different things for everyone. What is it about for you?
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:36:25
Nice try, Roger

Noooooooo, i had paper wallets in my safe deposit box :(
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:37:09
like welcoming a FUD machine.

while GS involvement may bring an ounce of credibility, it will bring pounds of price manipulation and fraud.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:42:58
I appreciate your optimism. The main concern for me is if too many average Joes are burned by the manipulation and lose faith in crypto.

Why would I pay good money for another hardware device when I can use my tried and true method of paper wallets for the cost of a sheet of paper and ink on bitaddress.org?

What about the fact that an increasing number of people now have the majority of their savings in cold storage cryptowallets, where before that capital would have been kept in the banking system?
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:46:11
Most people are sheep. We need to the sheep to feel safe in bitcoin. GS will not help.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:40:33
ok, so bitcoin is only for cryptographers who fully understand hash functions, electronic sigs etc? get real. bitcoin is for the people. not just the elite.

idk, make society better?

Hello bitcoin price suppression. hodl

Paper wallets were my first form of cold storage. Last year I heard they were "so 2014" and bought a ledger s nano. Now my computer is not recognizing the device. Going back to paper wallets asap
@_date: 2014-10-21 05:19:57
Yes. Because I love convenience. And bitcoin is the most convenient way to pay people and buy things on the internet.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:57:58
Exclude someone from the blockchain? How would that even be possible?
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:53:22
bitcoin is finally a household name after this last December. full adoption is years away but the sooner the wolves move in the sooner the sheep are pushed out. there is nothing we can do to stop GS from creating a futures market but let's not be deluded into thinking that this is a good thing for the community.

Yes I have the public and private addresses. I added some funds (1 USD) to my funding account and it is working properly now. I still don't know why the app would ask for my private key in order to send funds to the offline wallet no matter how small the amount was...
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:11:18
i would like to play.
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:50:43
I am trying to add funds to the wallet, not send funds from the wallet. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:21:46
Thank you. Curious about cryptocards... I like the fire resistance. What client do you recommend to check the balance and retrieve funds?
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:36:38
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:11:08
don't think so. at this point I am pretty sure that the scan malfunctioned because I was sending such tiny amounts of money that the small transactions did not contain enough to cover the miner's fee.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:24:06
please explain...
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:23:17
You rule, dude!
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:07:48
It was an excellent step-by-step guide that I am trying to send to my friends and family who are holding any coin.
