There are two possibilities BTC is either $200,000 or $2. For our sake let’s hope the former

In no way does it collectively save money. The US debt count would double + interest (so essentially triple) within a decade with a free healthcare plan, let alone a lifetime of free HC. Read the article from an unbiased prospective and come back to tell me that is a good idea

Everyone in the country has to pay for your free meds, free doctors, free specialist, free surgeries even. Is it a ludicrous idea to pay for YOUR OWN medical care?! I’d prefer to manage my own money rather then let he gov tell me how to spend it. But if you don’t feel comfortable controlling your own money then do you, I’m not going to convince you you’re wrong over reddit

Free healthcare = lower quality healthcare
Edit: US has the best healthcare in the world and that’s facts. People come from all over the world to receive top tier care here. But ya, if the US provides free healthcare *that will stay the same* right?

Since you don’t have any concrete information as to why medical care magically cost 90% less when it’s state run here is some data to show that you’re wrong. Please don’t throw out random statistics that can’t be backed up, wastes everyone’s time -
