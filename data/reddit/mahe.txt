Ha-ha. I doubt that we will live to see the ideal crypto world. Just because national governments are too powerful nowadays, they control our lives and our money. Until modern countries exist, fiat currencies exist too. To introduce cryptocurrencies as one and only means of payment, we need to build the decentralized but global world without local authorities and without intermediaries. It sounds like utopia. Get my words correctly, I’m a huge fan of BTC and other coins but I look at modern world and don’t believe in a quick jump to crypto society. It will be a long and difficult process.  
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:50:39
 Honestly, I don't know such an exchange. But I've heard it's possible to use bots for trading. If you're talking about the automized Stop order, this feature is available almost everywhere. But I don't use it as I prefer to have everything under control.

Bitcoin has a long way to cover. And I’m sure that it will have its ups and downs. MtGox is probably the first but not the last issue Bitcoin was through. I think that is the way things should go. There is no easy money, there is no trial without error, there is no ups without downs. Such crashes can immediately shatter Bitcoin, but in a long term they temper the whole crypto industry.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:38:03
It is already different than that. The only reason people continue drawing such sketches is because Bitcoin needs a bit more time to become truly widespread. It’s just a matter of time (and it’s not a long period.)

I am not going to be that tough. I heard about this issue from my brother. His verification was pending for 6 days (if I am not mistaken). He contacted the support, they escalated the problem to the department in charge and eventually solved it. 
I also have an account with CEX.io for quite a while and it all went well. When I was getting through verification, it was really fast. It took about a day or so. Things happen...
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:00:26
That's actually one of the benefits, so I find it funny when some people say that bitcoin is for the wealthy only.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:06:06
 So far as currencies may replace one another (like euro or new bolivat in Venezuela), I agree that they can disappear. But the average lifespan of a currency must be more than 27 years. Where did you find this exact number? For example, Belgian franc existed for 167 years. We need more stats for a solid research. Speaking of crypto, some altcoins exist for weeks or months and then disappear, so nobody knows which one is better to invest in. That's why the balance is essential and we as investors should combine fiat and crypto.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:10:08
I believe that he’s speaking of a very long-term period. So much long-term that it’s hard to say what Bitcoin will be like at that time. Even considering Bitcoin’s power right now, maybe in that long period there will be another better cryptocurrency. What is known for now is that the functionality brought by cryptocurrency and blockchain will be implemented everywhere and will be updated very intensively. Because blockchain is wider than Bitcoin. So, even after what he said, there is no doubt that blockchain is the future. Whether it’s Bitcoin or something else.

I prefer cex.io. It is the one with the most convenient user interface. I have bought my first BTC there using my credit card. So, if you’re a newbie, I believe that this is the easiest way.

Nobody can guarantee that crypto will go up or down as well as that it will survive at all. Speaking of BTC vs BCH, my idea is that it’s always better to diversify and buy both.

When I look at this chart it makes me understand the idea of how expert traders react to the market changes. They have a rule: you get profits as long as you avoid panic. Do not sell Bitcoins when everyone sells them, do not buy them when everyone buys them. Basically you must do the exact opposite. It seems to be easy to understand, but I sometimes fall into panic as well.

 Agree with BitcoinHobbyist. Such questions shouldn’t be asked from strangers. It's only up to you. If you want to continue holding your assets, then do so. Or you can try to sell them. Probably for such purpose won’t be not a bad idea to use exchanges I think. For example, [cex ]( is a good option for this purpose. The platform is also friendly for beginners (it provides a guide on how to use their services).

I’ve just checked the website. And it looks really good. So, if it's all true and it was designed by players to players, then they should really know what a gambler wants to see and receive. And as we know all gamblers love bonuses, rewards or loyal programs. And it really is no secret, as even articles about top games players say so – [  But another thing they value is their account and money safety.

@_date: 2018-11-27 15:37:13
 Of course, there are some decent exchanges apart from Binance. As long as fiats are still widely used, exchanges that allow both crypto and fiat trading are more beneficial in my opinion. Try CEX. It’s secure and user-friendly, plus, it offers reasonable fees.   
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:58:10
 Coinbase is good, however, if you are looking for cheaper fees, try CEX. This reliable and secure exchange works in NY. Once you have passed verification, you can purchase Bitcoins instantly with fiats. CEX allows making deposit via fee-free wire transfers or using credit cards.

 Cryptocurrencies don’t need regulations by the government because it will kill the main concept of decentralization. They appeared and were developed without any help or assistance from governments. All achievements of Bitcoin and other cryptos are possible not thanks to regulations and authorities but rather for spite of them. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:25:13
 Of course, Bitcoin should be a long-term investment. The price will grow because institutional investors are interested in it but haven’t entered the crypto market yet. Another factor for a higher demand in the future is the limited number of coins. Finally, Bitcoin is the number one crypto to be adopted by masses. To buy it and sell it right away is not long-sighted. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:38:42
 Agree that this is definitely time for HODL – most investors are doing so as trading volumes drop. It can mean that people consider Bitcoin as a store of value more than as a medium of exchange. We can’t say that adoption is growing, but who knows what will happen when the price increases in the forthcoming bull run. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:42:30
 As far as people believe in Bitcoin's growth, there's no surprise that they tend to hold it now. The price has recently reached a new bottom since October 2017, although the holding trend continuous which proves Bitcoin's value. It is also a fact that the usage of Bitcoin for payments has decreased dramatically ( We can see that Bitcoin needs some improvements to recover.

@_date: 2019-01-31 12:08:32
 This year is completely opposite to 2018. But it’s a part of the wave which falls and rises again every time. Bitcoin had big falls having lost 70-85% of its value, and it always recovers. I don’t know how much will it cost in the future, but it will always be by much more expensive than $100. If not in the nearest future but for our kids, we can leave the inheritance in bitcoin that will benefit for them.

Roughly, bitcoin is only a piece of code. So, if you own bitcoins, it means you have an access to bitcoins. This ‘access’ is either a private key or a backup phrase, which is better to be kept in cold storage.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:45:46
 In addition to already recommended Gemini and Coinbase, I would also add [cex]( It's one of the oldest exchanges with many methods of payment, which is quite handy imo. Moreover, you can withdraw your assets to your credit/debit card there. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:10:04
The author of the article is right. It’s not wise to store all your crypto on exchanges, better use a cryptocurrency wallet. Also, I must admit that the article quite laconically structured, I liked that he mentioned only significant things. And it’s good that he mentioned binance as it’s quite reliable, but I’d add another example of cryptocurrency exchange, for example CEX - [ as you can buy btc with fiat there and the fees are quite reasonable too. I suppose that such kind of information might be useful for someone.

 I guess that coinbase, which was mentioned here, is not bad, you may try it.  Still, I think that [cex]( is also worthy to pay attention at. . I'm using it currently and for now nothing has gone wrong - quite simple and pretty good in terms of security.

It always makes me wonder why people are so easy to fall into mass panic. Each time someone runs into a problem with an exchange, it causes so much sensation.

 Create an account on a reputed exchange. I think cex will fit you the most due to several reasons. The platform has an intuitive interface which is ideal for newcomers, and it accepts fiats. The verification process including sending a photo of your ID is a bit tedious on the other hand you needn’t worry about the security. When your account is verified deposit money with a credit card or beneficial fee-free wire transfer and choose the option to buy bitcoin. Don’t forget to acquire a wallet to put your bitcoins in. Then type the bitcoin address of the person and click a send button, it’s done.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary currency with breakthrough technology. Probably it will replace fiat in the far future because it’s already the cryptocurrency that has the value in almost all the countries. Bitcoin can be bought and sold worldwide for many different fiat currencies. It’s borderless and apolitical. That’s why people who know it, selling their dollars to buy bitcoin. And pressure on bitcoin by the governments proves that there is a real threat to the current financial system. I think that at the moment bitcoin is the most powerful currency. If you want to keep your funds inaccessible to the government, buying bitcoin is the best option. Moreover, it’s not that hard to buy bitcoin ( [ ) from almost any country, as there are international exchanges like cex. Additionally, you can buy there btc not only with US dollars but with other fiat currencies as well. I think the time will show what form of money will win.
