Its not just greed, there were a lot of investors who have already done extremely well from bitcoin and are trying to help expand bitcoin with discretionary capital they can afford to lose, had neobee been legitimate it could have contributed to this markedly.
Its a bit rich to blame investors for getting defrauded, this was some what more sophisticated than a nigerian prince scheme.
If the company launches and does well they are all heroes for putting their capital on the line, turns out the guy was an incredible fraud and suddenly they are all greedy assholes?

let me make it clear.
the only problem here is danny, nobody elses actions have anything to do with this except for danny.
you can blame any external factor you want and make any excuse you like but danny is the one who skipped out with the money and screwed everyone.

spare us your socialism thank you very much.
collectivism does not work, that money comes from somewhere, you are saying i want the government to go and steal from others so i can get money.
wealth redistribution does not work, and when it is at the point where everyone gets paid to do fuck all its a great sign that the moral decay of that society is beginning to peak.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:56:40
You can't maybe see some logistical issues that may arise during the enforcement of mr lawsky's proposals?
if you are running a small cash business and the state tells you to report all your customers details and there is no way for them to know anything about what business you are doing are you going to comply? out of the goodness of your heart to stay true to your social contract?
Where will the resources come from to enforce these laws?
how can they prove anything either way?
This is about as effective as J-walking laws, sure some poor soul's might get made an example of, but everyone else with half a brain will just adapt around it and get on with business.
these laws are a pipe dream.
If they had a way to genuinely enforce this kind of control onto bitcoin everyone would jump ship to an alt-coin.
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:41:49
bitcoin was created to make people like him irrelevant by regulating itself with a protocol, he realizes this so he must manufacture reasons why intervention is still required and the tried and true dogma of "there is no legitimacy in anything that the state is not knee deep in" is how he achieves this. 
interventionists don't innovate, they only seek to control and predate off the innovation of others, creating his own alternative that he thinks its better would require actual innovation.
but yes that would be a good reply :)

this is the type of hubris that makes a good central planner that only he has the wisdom to tell the rest of us serfs the correct way to live and the best way each system should work.

There are not many safe places for capital anymore, take a look around the markets, bitcoin is already providing value to the market as a store of value out of prying eyes, this has vast value well above bitcoins current market cap long before we are using it for our daily exchange.
"If the point of the regulations is to reduce the spread of Bitcoin then it's a very successful strategy don't you think? "
Not really dude it just gets more people talking about bitcoin, the fact government feels it needs to address it validates it in peoples minds anyway even more.
do not misunderstand the value of being able to hide your wealth.
i am not totally disagreeing with you here, if you are against the regulations we basically agree, but jumping through the governments hoops gets us nowhere, if you feel differently act differently, we are all different :)

yeah thats true, and if you dont have much to play with i would not advise doing anything other than keeping your coin in the safest wallet you can technically muster.
but if you are sitting pretty, and have funds you can happily afford to speculate with like the many of the neobee investors did then its not really being "reckless"
i have 800 btc, i lost 1.5 btc speculating on neobee because it looked promising and i want to support the community in its infancy am i a reckless investor?
because this type of situation is where the majority of the money came from.

im saying both situations are wrong and there is no point going from one inherently immoral system to another.

@_date: 2014-07-29 04:22:22
taxes and borrowing are preferred options, but they dont really cover it anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:41:33
money should not be artificially distributed, it should be derived in the market.
you are saying right now creation is controlled by the powerful few, but your proposal is no different.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:15:53
Large corporations only adopt regulation when its enforced on everyone equally, otherwise they do no benefit from doing so, thats kind of the point of regulation in the first place.
If all smaller competitor's can simply dodge the regulations as they please it will not in anyway be beneficial for those larger corporations to support laws that they are the only ones subjected to.
Bitcoin needs awareness only it does not need the "approval or support" of large corporations or governments, once people see whats now possible the current paradigm and system will become irrelevant.
The current status quo will not be here forever, the "option" of just staying on the dollar system eventually will not be a viable one.
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:49:47

Never had a problem with btc-e, its a good service and the less info they expect from me the more respect i have for them.
If you guys need a rubber stamp from mother government to do something thats great there is plenty of places now that have one.
some of us dont see that as a prerequisite but more of a problem and so btc-e is more appealing.
keeping the bulk of your coins on any exchange or anywhere other than your own wallet is asking for trouble anyway.
you do whats right for you, let others make their decisions.
why run around ragging out on an exchange because you dont feel its positioned under the jackboot to your liking?
If you dont trust it dont use it. being scared somebody might fail in the market and effect the value of your coins does not give you the right to decide who can and cannot participate and how they run their business.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:51:31
while using some incompetent bureaucrats outlook slip up as an indictment of the whole of government probably isnt fair.

@_date: 2014-06-08 01:03:28
you are missing the point.
the point is you can not legislate the currency, you cannot force what the currency is you cannot have government choose the currency for everyone.
you need to let the market decide, and let people decide what they like best or what holds their purchasing power best for them.
corruption is a problem now because there is no competing alternative, do you think if there was no currency laws everyone would use the horrible constantly debased debt based fiat crap we are forced to use now.
ofcourse not.

You are not understanding deregulation in the terms the libertarians are using it.
when we say deregulate the banks we are not saying lets remove a few laws that restrict banking practices.
We are saying:
Abolish central banking.
Remove government from the control and issue of currency completely.
abolish any form of government guarantee on any banking practice like the fdic etc, if the banks want insurance they can fucking buy it like everyone else.
you guys are sitting here thinking these libertarians are crazy cowboys looking to screw you out of your "consumer protections" and how will we be protected without regulation, but you are not looking at the big picture nor do most of you actually understand the system as a whole.
btw incase you havent noticed the 401k scheme is one of the largest ponzi schemes in history.
The US government has "regulated" the US economy into a 200 trillion dollar hole that it will not recover from without printing its way out and destroying the quality of life for the vast majority of Americans, do you really think we just need to double down on even more regulation to fix this? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:25:18
it may give them advantage during the shift to the new paradigm but in the long run they will need to make good capital decisions or continue to innovate to maintain or improve their position.
as apposed to now where shit is so rigged the system is literally designed to keep wealth concentrated at the top without the need for wise capital control if theres a fuck up they are bailed out, and they dont need to innovate because regulation and high barrier of entry protects them from competition.
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:04:54

These guys cant enforce their proposed laws and acknowledgement only really serves to validate them. Just go about your business carefully and ignore them.
That is the only way you are going to get the change you want, if you think anything you say and do is going to influence the plans these guys have for this you really dont know how government works.
If these people genuinely had your interests or small business's interests or anyone else but their own interests at heart they would not be proposing draconian shit like this in the first place would they?

Everything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, its called the subjective theory of value, that's basic economics. [

Ben Lawsky and the whole regime can kiss my ass.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:47:55


are you serious.
ok using your example, lets say the funds went into an insured account instead of an uninsured one and you then as you say went and used them as collateral for a futures bet, you fucked up the bet and lost the money.
you still lose your money. the insured account does not insure you if you take it out or use it as collateral for something else, it only insures if the institution the account resides with defaults on the funds. they do not magically become responsible for the bad decisions of the account holder.
On top of that there are already laws for speculating with client funds without disclosure, you dont need a new regulation for that. fraud is fraud is fraud its nothing new that requires 2m dollars for it.
If i am running a warehouse where i am storing client capital and i speculate using the deposited capital as collateral and lose it all thats fraud or even theft and it doesnt matter what accounts are insured where and you lose your money either way.
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:36:03
Sure theres value, its gives a huge advantage to those with the excess 2m over those without it. Im sure those who benefit value it greatly and im sure the states coffers also see value in it. If you think an acceptable outcome for any regulation is to confine opportunities to the rich at the expense of the poor then im not surprised you can see value in such cartelizing behaviour.
The state is not your friend, they do not make dictates to keep you safe, their purpose is to control and extract resources under the veil of legitimacy, if you cant see that by now then i dont know what to tell you.
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:13:11

@_date: 2015-04-26 02:50:07
lets say both of us are tech entrepreneurs, we both have built ourselves business plans and a model to run a bitcoin exchange and raised enough capital to fund the operations, my plan is better than your plan and my model has a much better likely hood of succeeding and is a sound plan morally.
the state steps in and clips everyone 2 million, your dad is minted and gives you 2m dollars to pay off the state, i cant get 2m from anywhere so your crappy business plan takes the place of my superior one for no other reason than you had connections with more money.
you can call me fruitcake or tin foil conspiracy or what ever other thought terminating cliché you can come up with it does not change the reality of this situation.
@_date: 2015-04-25 06:03:59
I dont see how raising 2m over the top of your operating costs and giving it to a state cartel improves your integrity or viability as a business.
If anything it just says that all the people who cannot raise an excess of 2m to do this do not deserve the opportunity. meanwhile the state is all about equal opportunity right?

 "A Bank wants to simply take your money, and provide credit to others to use your money to fund their home, car, business, etc… there is no big mystery or conspiracy behind it."
except that banking has not worked this way for a very long time.
banks stopped relying on deposits a long time ago, they are just borrowing from the central banks for next to nothing  and then lending that out at interest and leveraged to the hill.
There is no real world motivation to keep your money in a bank with the current interest rates, banks make more money from people taking on debt and the best way to induce debt is low interest rates.
the concept that the money existed before you took out a loan is a wives tale now, the money that you borrow does not exist until you sign for the loan, then it is "created" as credit from that point on, thats how new money comes into the economy after all through debt.
all fiat money is debt, if you have 100k in your bank, you are just holding 100k of someone elses debt.
bankers have been a cancer on society for hundreds of years and i dare say they are at their peak dominance over the last 10 years.

it certainly is a romantic notion, the state is not in the business of promoting freedom of choice nor competition.
but there is some small hope, fiats days are numbered now, and while the collapse of the current situation will most likely end in some IMF sdr type system where we all get fucked over worse than now with some world central bank horror show, there is the slight possibility of some kind of return to sound money in the aftermath instead.

yeah certainly does make it easier to discredit him.
especially to turn other servicemen against him.
hopefully people can use this as a turning point and we can force atleast some kind of change at the executive level as lately its really seems like we are facing a genuine decent in to tyranny and the world was just gonna sit by and let it happen because desperate housewives of wherever the fuck rich town was on bravo.

more than enough to scare the glen stevens worshipping central bank is the key to aus prosperity general public. Australia has been insulated from the economic misery most of the world has experienced over the last 5-6 years thanks to a resource/iron ore boom off china so the status quo has been good to most here while the rest of the world burned. 
Because of this there is a much wider community base vested in maintaining that status quo which i suspect will translate into resistence to bitcoin.

wikileaks offered the administration to vet the information and they refused, that is a bullcrap story anyway surely you can see that at this point, the collateral murder video didnt need any vetting.
i think its the fact that war crimes in an oversea's country to non americans is more "palatable" to the american public that someone snooping their porn history.

if they both have function they will both be priced on the market accordingly to their demand and supply.
this is one of the main problems with our current monetary system and why a system like bitcoin was devised because there is no currency choice, its not a free market there is a monopoly on currency from the state, this traps us into being forced to accept their inflation taxation.
if there was two currencies running right now side by side
say US dollar which the supply can be manipulated
and US dowlar which the supply cannot be manipulated.
the market will chose whichever one holds its value the best.
if they both perform the same function and hold the same value it will just come down to personal choice.

dont think thats how it works guys. also long gone are the days of banks requiring deposits to lend. you sign for the loan and at that point the money is created with an entry into the banks ledger, it does not exist before that point. 
all fiat money is debt.

i think when it comes to money the people will take the time to learn how to protect it.
and the fact there is no physical asset there should prevent most circumstances where u need the bank to secure it.

unfortunately the majority still see government as a force for good with an inherent mission for the benefit of its citizens that unfortunately has the odd corrupt person spoiling it for everyone. 
Instead of the reality that the governments sole purpose is to maximize its profit from the tax livestock within the geographical area that it maintains a monopoly of force upon.

i can now donate to any person in this world who has an internet connection and the ability to create a btc wallet, charity becomes redundant. for examples sake lets say this is someone in africa who is inheritently poverty stricken no bank account etc but a prepay cheap smartphone with a dataplan, i can give directly to that person or even bankroll projects in their village. that is intrinsic value to me.
i love gold but i cant ship it to africa or wherever to help people, atleast not with insane risk.
ive always been a big peter schiff fan and have made financial decisions sometimes based on his opinions but i really believe he has it wrong this time. this intrinsic value argument is bullshit to me.

a bubble is just malinvestment in a particular area, asset class etc.
generally this comes about through false price signals like artificially low interest rates.
bad price signal = poor investment decisions = malinvestment = bubble.
just because bitcoin is being adopted rapidly does not mean that adoption is malinvestment. 
sure there are plenty of people who are speculating, but they are speculating on its future function as a currency, payment system whatever, not its future price.

oh yeah dude no doubt that will happen they will go through his whole world and surely find something about his character that they can demonize him with. 
But for now hes getting a hero's welcome, when the manning situation came to light the general populous and a very large percentage of reddit were calling him traitor treason whatever else when the reality is hes equally as much of a hero as this brave hero Mr Snowden
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:32:28
sure snowden is a hero, and greenwald is now a hero.
but what about manning? assange? they did the same thing.
assange has been warning about this forever as well.
ive read so many people calling manning a rat and a traitor but suddenly this guy is a hero for the ages?
they did the same thing, exposed the abuses of government power.
there is no difference, those who try and differentiate between the two with minor differences that do not represent the facts of the overall situation are sheep or war mongers.
