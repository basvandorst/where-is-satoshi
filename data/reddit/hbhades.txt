I agree that shilling for altcoins in a bitcoin based subreddit has no place. At the same time jokes that take jabs at problems with other altcoins should also have no place.
Keep in mind that this video is also posted to both major ethereum sub-reddits r/ethereum and r/ethtrader. So it's not like ethereum is trying to bury this hilarious video.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:48:06
What development are you referring to? Almost nothing has changed since this debate started.

You may want to read closer my friend. I could care less about the failures of the dao. The double standard of this subreddit is what I question.

Less action than most open source projects. Your point?

With the brexit vote showing leave...it very well could be a great one (at least for crypto)

My point exactly. Thanks XD
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:17:56
The double-standard that exists in this subreddit is nonsense. Only negative news for other cryptos are allowed, while all positives are removed. Way to go hypocrites. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:28:27
That was a single spammer who we publicly did not condone his actions and he was ostracized by the community because of them. I'm sorry that happened to us all...but that has little to do with what I'm talking about.

Check out Etherspace:
Game + Smart Contract
Rouleth is also working fine at the moment
I agree that it is early and there is not a lot out there (except for above), but I still have yet to see any good sidechain or smart contract apps working on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:31:35
I'm sure you can find double standards all over the place. The problem is no one wants to stand up and say anything is wrong. 
Seems like it's this way across the board...people gave up on trying to make a difference.

Well I guess they do say ignorance is bliss.

We should make this a thing.
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:34:23
At least in my case I'm a supporter of both BTC/ETH...this is why we think anti-crypto statements (made from either side) are so odd. We both want the same thing in the end, and I don't see a future where only one crypto survives.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:44:26
Honest question, What's the point? Hold back adoption?
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:53:27
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:41:23
While this may be how things are "now" this is deffinitely not how they were when Ethereum was on an uptrend and first broke 1B market cap. I guess we will wait and see if the doublestandard still exists...my bet is that it does until proven otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:11:29
Trading view, it is quite nice and has most crypto markets for a bunch of exchanges.
Highly customizable if you pay monthly, well worth it IMO.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:16:37
It could be dangerous. But mostly in the fact that it is more volatile.
10x increases are much more insane and have happened before.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:44:07
seems fishy, and oddly timed.
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:12:38
Only issue is that ETH can do it today, and not just theoretically on paper.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:02:40

Right now BTC loan rates are at 5%. 5% regardless of how much you have. If that rate remains for 15 days you can double your stash. But, there is also the risk that Polo is insolvent or gets hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:26:15
Except that the rate has been 2%+ for over 2 days. That is still a significant gain.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:45:43
I still have 2 sizable loans at 4% that have not closed out.
I was using the 15 days as an example anyways. No one thought that the rates would remain that high for long lol.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:26:11
Well in the last week the total market cap of all crypto increased 30%+...so your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:23:28
Debit/credit Chip+pin just did this exact change. Look at how frustrated people are with that minor change
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:27:20
Actually, all you mean is that current PoS structures are not viable. That doesn't mean a viable one is not possible. 
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:19:59
I think it would be in addition to capital gains. Otherwise that would be an easy loophole.
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:43:37
Based on the article, is Satoshi now a tax evader unless he pays tax on his forked coins?
Is this an attempt to either document everyone's stash or hold a felony against those that refuse?
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:16:59
\&gt;  POS is a pipe dream.
Yah, but the world is built on pipe dreams. Look at bitcoin itself, that alone had to be one big pipe dream at some point. Now look at where it is. Engineer's are great problem solvers. Something tells me that there are ways to mitigate issues with PoS attack vectors.

In 5 years we will still see posts where people had no idea valve started accepting bitcoin 2 years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:15:31
If there was no risk to the investment everyone would have done it. That's the point.
Don't mistake hindsight on an extremely risky investment with a mistake. It could have easily gone the opposite direction.

While I agree with some of the info in this article. There is a chance the author is wrong...Right? 
Even time tested economists brushed bitcoin off as a scam initially. Now they study the block chain in school. 
I think that keeping an objective opinion is what separates us from the uninformed. We should embrace other crypto as an increase in the complete ecosystem instead of brushing them off as scams or shitcoins unless we want to end up like many disbelievers now. Struggling to catch up. Anyone in crypto should be treated as an ally...Not an enemy.
TL;DR Although I agree with some of what is in the article. I think just saying "this is fine" ignores a blatent problem.
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:43:15
Yep seems like  :P
@_date: 2016-09-21 19:51:32
"Exactly as programmed" still remains true. The community decided on a fix to the code, achieved consensus, and the code was adopted by most of the miners. The new code is working "Exactly as programmed".
I'm both invested in BTC and ETH for the foreseeable future with no sells in sight. I just feel that this competitive bashing is as bad as people hating on another sports team. There is no need as we both are fighting the good fight (somewhat differently though).

Where did lukejr's get this number? Does he have his source available? 162k seems really high in comparison to every other node count.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:43:42
The fact you think that 1:2000 people in the US are running a full node makes me laugh *dawg*.

Bitcoin maximalists are all the same. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:35:21
Yet still 37% above bitcoin's node count
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:13:52


You should read my last reply. Competition is good, infighting gets us nowhere. I agree that bitcoin has done a lot for changing the world, but to think that it **can't** lose the majority market share is just plain silly.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:15:31
Okay, so you're a man of science...then you should at least find it odd that there is only **one** source claiming 165k listening nodes and no others.
Like I said before, that's very strange. I also find it very strange that you are so strongly defending something as huge of a discrepancy as that.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:39:18
And everyone who responds like this tends to be narrow-minded Bitcoin maximalists.
Other crypto is here to stay...the faster you realize competition is healthy the faster the area matures.

@_date: 2016-09-21 17:56:51
Yet it seems like the devs and community banded together and fixed the issue and kept on trucking. 
The same could be said for the time Bitcoin was expoited via an overflow bug to produce ungodly amount of bitcoin. This too could have been a disaster and was herdforked to fix the issue.
I'm calling you some  and some  on this one.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:14:08
In addition. There is no source showing how lukejr's collected this data. Only a pie chart and some versions. That's about as clear or valid as a graph with an arrow but now axis values.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:05:14
I found something that contradicts your claims quite clearly. 
You should understand how clear it is that you are wrong. lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:15:50
The thought that the EVM is "permanently constrained" is laughable. The EVM can be and has been extended and forked just like any other software. A proper solution just needs to be designed.
The fact that people expect perfection or futureproofing out of the gate is just silly. Software development is about iterating and solving issues not exhaustive planning.

If I'm so wrong please show me where. I'm actually curious. I know you don't owe me anything. 
Did you mean to say that only a small subset of nodes run in listen=1 and that is where the smaller node count is coming from?
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:48:34
Odd, because other sites lists it at around 10-12k

Might want to check your facts *dawg*. Or stop considering liteclients full nodes lol
Also, here. Some good reading: 
@_date: 2016-09-21 14:29:07
You realize your joke is at the expense of a community who does not attack you in any way (some rogues excepted).
My thought is this is because of two possibilities.
1. You simply don't understand ethereum and so you feel it is a scam. Fair enough, but people that don't understand btc still call it a Ponzi. Seems hypocritical.
2. You watch all the positive development announcements from Devon 2 in the last few days and are starting to feel  insecure or unsure of the bitcoin devs who can't even agree on blocksize changes. So you joke at the expense of eth to balance these feelings.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:00:49
Over 60% of the world has 0 knowledge of Bitcoin. Don't even pretend to ignore that. 
1:10k would be closer if you add all major countries that actually know what bitcoin is, even that is completely outlandish. These numbers seem extremely padded.
Might want to look up delusions of grandeur sir.
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:59:36
Doesn't this go against the ideas of open source? Also this allows one engineer alone to possibly manipulate the node count in order to "prove" superiority.
Any time someone tells you "just trust me", you should be weary.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:20:35
Writing machine code in the old days of computers was also painful. The EVM just needs a nice easy (non-solidity) language to bring devs in.
@_date: 2016-09-21 19:47:15
A) Although I cant speak to the validity of solidity being derived from javascript, I can however speak to the fact that Javascript when tied with node.js is where a majority of new web development is being done.
B) "If it suits them" is misleading, the truth is "If a majority of the  (mining) community decides it suits them" is what happened. Much like any other crypto fork a chain requires consensus.
But, somehow I feel that no matter what I say you will remain close-minded. That's your choice man.
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:49:46
You want to talk about "assumptions" then show me a programmatic method of proving 165k full nodes.
Lukejr's pie chart is just that a single chart showing this number.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:03:01
You've been nothing but cryptic. At this point you truly are just a troll or seriously delusional.
The use of pronouns when you could easy mean two things is exceptionally unclear and overly presumptuous.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:47:28
Do you even understand the term programmatic? You dodged my question when I used it.
How about statistical outlier? If all sources BUT one produce similiar stats and one doesn't in a set. It is usually ignored. So, unless you can show anywhere else that has 165k nodes for Bitcoin. GTFO

@_date: 2018-03-22 13:20:29
Seems like you just finished reading "how to be pertentious and cryptic on Reddit". Seems to be working. Or am I assuming again?
We clearly believe different schools of thought. But the fact you think lite clients count as 'nodes' makes me laugh. They don't protect the network at all.
Or: maybe you just blindly follow the highest node calculation while all others show less then 10% of lukejr's. Chance is his calculations are way off.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:57:10
I'm curious, but how will the transition to PoS be bloody? It seems like the addition of the Iceage difficulty bomb has protected the transition from PoW to PoW/PoS and eventually to full PoS. Are you meaning that a change as drastic as PoW to PoS could never go over well? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:15:54
Well, that's the whole idea of the Iceage timebomb. PoW difficulty will become impossible for mining more and more every day with or without additional hashpower. This was put in place years ago so that the transition to PoS will be less contentious. But, you have a point...it could still become a seriously bad transition. Only time will tell.

I'm not sure how long you've been around but there has been plenty of hostility towards anything non-BTC from this community over the years. It seems like this did not change until Litecoin lost the  spot to Ethereum not long ago.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:02:02
I think someone has been saying the same about the bitcoin ecosystem for a long time...governments. They think bitcoin is a bubble, scam, or a trend that will just disappear.
It can seem rather contradictory to say things in one context but deny them in another. We have a word for it...hipocracy.
What we should be doing is not attacking others for being successful and accept that both sides are quite successful and are building a better world for us and our children.
