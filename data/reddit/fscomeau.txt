Do it. You wont get my bitcoins.

I do have ether however I don't like it. I understand the smart contract thing which is clever but I don't think Ether has implemented it correctly, the dev fees are WAY too insane. I think it will keep going up for a while but it will get beaten by something better eventually.

They'll kill me anyway. My bitcoins will die with me

I know right? I mean, it's not like gamers can't order a 980 that will can play the game almost at ultra settings anyway.

Yes and you should see my upcoming Apple play. It's going to massively crater post-earnings. Already cratering from $179 to 170 last week, will definitely crash to below $150 after earnings.
I have a ton of $190 puts that I bought when Apple was $177 so I feel pretty good about myself right now ^_^.

id destroy my nano ledger s and then tell them to fuck off: "Now no one gets it."
No proof they wont kill you or your family anyway even if you do give in

Thank you.

Meh 10 mins. I enjoyed writing it.

I'd let them shoot me. Fuck off.

Bitcoin ETF simply means that a guy somewhere buys 10,000 BTC and then tell people: "Buy 1% of my 'ETF'! It's like buying 100 BTC! I charge a 5% fee per year btw but shhhh"
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:23:30
It is simplified, that much is true, and definitely not a complete introduction to futures, however the information presented is accurate for the purpose of understanding futures
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:03:23
Sorry it wasn't clear. 
So there is the spot price. The spot price is the price of a bitcoin today. Like, right now. Like, on the exchanges.
Then there are all the futures prices - March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, etc. Most futures go on a month per month basis but there is no reason it cannot be weekly or even daily. It's just like that because of convenience.
People who go SHORT on March 2018 contract obviously think it will trade at less than $18,300 in March 2018 (unless they are hedging/losing money on purpose). This means they expect the SPOT price to be below $18,300 on March 14th, 2018. That will be the final settlement date so if bitcoin is at 0 at this point, the shorter will have made $18,300 in profits.
Indeed, the spot price will be equal to the future price (barring any delivery fee/commission/etc.) on the expiration date.

You can sell if you think it is going lower, HOWEVER you might not be able to get back in in time and thats a risk I won't time.
I am adding all the way through below $10k if needed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:23:06
You have to pay the  difference every say.
For instance:
TODAY: 
MARCH future is $18,000. We enter a contract with a settlement price of $18k. I buy (go long), you sell (go short).
MARCH future is now $17,000. I pay you $1,000.
TWO DAYS FROM NOW:
MARCH futures is now $18,000. You pay me $1,000.
THREE DAYS FROM NOW:
MARCH future is now $20,000. You pay me $2,000.
In total, I have made $2,000 off you (so far)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:53
If you short it, but spot price goes up, then the futures price will go up too, and you will need to pay the increase in the futures price daily.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:29:31
No?  Lol. 
Look at the large bitcoin collider.

That's highly theoritical. People still debate on whether 51% attack are a risk or not.

Yeah I have so much to sell here

^ This, a million times
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:36
Ahhhh gold, the most volatile asset on earth, of course!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:31:20
You CANNOT close the contract, you can only resell it to someone. So if you go long a future and want to get rid of it, you need to find another person that wants to go long on it. If you cannot do that, you are stuck with it until MAR, yes.
But in practice you will alwasy find someone ready to take your future off your hands since bitcoin has such a large volume. But for rarer products, then yes, you can be stuck holding that future for a while, unless you are ready to sell for a big discount.

Not all stocks pay dividends, in fact, most don't.


Nope. See the company that made sapphire glass for Apple.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:24:05
1000000% correct
Also, nothing prevents a person from trading between two accounts he owns (with two wallets) and manipulating the price in any way he sees fit. Except trading fees, which are minimal. But that could be worth it if you manage to move the price a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:24
Agreed. You should have your life savings + remortgage your house + maxed your credit credit in cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:21:26


Absolutely. The price of MAR futures is simply what people think the bitcoin will trade at at this time (less carrying cost as you correctly mentioned).
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:41
This one time, it's different!!!!!! Bitcoin is definitely a bubble/tulip/dying/dead/a scam/a Ponzi (pick one) (or several)
/s to be sure
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:17:54
If that happens, then you force the short seller to find new coins that he can give to you. If he cannot find new coins to give to you, then he has to close his short.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:55:47


Exactly. My point.
Coinbase knows they can get away with insider trading so they do insider trading. End of the story.
Just look at bitcoin price today. Obvious they crashed it on purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:04:23
I'm the professional trader here. That being said, yeah, I do have to check settlement details, I think 0 bitcoins are involved, ever.
To answer your question: Futures make it easier to invest because it's super hard to buy bitcoins otherwise. Sending money to a bank in Japan? NTY
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:51:49


Yeah, pretty much.


I wonder why...
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:04:24
Here's how I got to that value.
Gold has a total market value of $7.8
Trillion. Bitcoin has a total market cap of $0.241 Trillion. I think Gold is worth at least 10% of gold right now and will eventually be worth more than gold. But even if we are pessimistic, we can set it at 5% of gold value.
I'd set the lower bound of all bitcoins at $3.9T, or roughly $4T. Divided by 21M bitcoins, that's $190,000 per bitcoin. 
That would be my LOWER bound for the true value of bitcoins LONG TERM because obviously bitcoins are far more valuable than gold in my opinion
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:20
It's several things: a way to store value, a way to transfer money, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:08
Agreed 100%
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:30:07


Then sue them then. Go ahead. I'm waiting
... see?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:33:10


Then you aren't looking very hard
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:52
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:33:44
Wall Street guy here.
This is correct
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:18:21
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:19


You intuitively had it very right! Indeed, you could buy a bitcoin on the open market right now and go short a futures. You'd get $2,000 right now. Everything you said is correct.
The risk are:
1) You might lose your bitcoin (lost wallet, stolen key, etc.)
2) You might not be able to sell your bitcoin for cash, or you might pay high transactions fees
3) You would have to deposit money in the futures trading account to manage the margin.
Aside from that, yes, you could "print" a "free" $2,000 by doing the strategy above. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:56:40
Here's the issue.
Insider trading is not necessarily illegal here. Unethical, without a doubt, but illegal?
Bitcoins are not certified investments. Very doubtful there is a "crime" (at least the official definition) committed here.
Whether or not you want to keep giving money to them is another question however.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:20:04
ToS != law.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:01
Dude, stop looking at the bitcoin price. It's heavily manipulated and I'd bet than 100 traders get to decide the price. It doesn't represent the real price of bitcoins, period. 
Only 90k bitcoins are moving hands per day out of what, 15M? That's like nothing. And I could bet most of the bitcoins are traded between accounts owned by the same people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:59
Correct, the futures are cash settled. I discuss that part at the end of the post. Kept it simple for people
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:16:52
A fucking stock market genius?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:00:45
You are right, it is FAR better than a stock.
I traded stocks all my life and I'll be blunt: fuck stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:36:25
Cause if you want to buy a bitcoin today, you need $16,000
If you buy a bitcoin futures, you only need $6,000.
With the same $16,000, you can buy 2.6 bitcoin. If it rises, you make much more!!!!!!! :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:00
OP you got me. 
You are 100% right.
You CANNOT successfully trade bitcoins unless:
1) You just add on dips, which is not really trading
2) You have 100,000+ bitcoins and can manipulate prices
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:38:49
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:37:02
You can be both a professional trader and a professional moron.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:36:53
Let's say you have 1000 BTC and you want to sell one. Selling a futures would be a way to do it.
Why not sell a bitcoin directly on the market? Well, say the bitcoin trades at $7,000 today but the futures expiring a year from now is trading at $8,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:37:24
1) Open a broker account
That's it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:34:57
Thanks, not sure why I'm getting downvoted unfortunately. All I wrote was 100% accurate.
