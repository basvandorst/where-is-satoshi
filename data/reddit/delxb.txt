This is terrible advice, and frankly seems like a way to take money away from the inexperienced. While shorts are important for mature commodities, BTC is not mature and in general taking a long position is far less risky than a short. When you go long, all that you are risking is the money that you have already spent in acquiring the contract, with the potential upside of the moon.
When you go short, you are potentially making the amount you get for acquiring the contract, with the potential downside of hell.
I.E. Shorting 10 BTC at $100/BTC which would credit your account with $1000 and debit someone else's account (usually the broker) 10 BTC. This $1000 represents the MOST you can make from shorting, as if you decide to cover at $10/BTC, you buy back 10 BTC for $100, and give those 10BTC back to the person you borrowed them from, resulting in $900 profit. Thus, if BTC goes to hell and is worth $0, you make $1000, as 10BTC*$0/BTC is $0 and $1000-$0 = $1000.
But what if the price goes to $200/BTC? Then you have to spend $2000 from your account to give back the 10BTC, and end up with a net profit of $1000 - $2000 = -$1000!
What if the price goes to $1000/BTC? Then you lose $9000!
The potential profit is trivial compared to the potential loss, as the loss is unbounded, but the profit is finite.
And with how wild the price swings are with BTC,  you may cover your short at the worst time. Shorting such an uncertain price action is best left to special people who think they know the future.

At 1% interest, the principal doubles roughly every 72 compounding periods. 
You can use this “rule of 72” to get very decent approximations of the doubling time for other small interest rates as well, e.g. 10% would take roughly 72/10 pay periods to double the principal.

I generally agree with you on your statement, but the table is a bit biased in how it assumes people interact with Bitcoin. 
The standpoint that Bitcoin is taking on the table is only really fairly comparable to holding cash.
Specifically rows 3 and 4 of the table assume that Bitcoin can only be used the way prescribed, but online wallet services are proving popular and stand opposed to the bullet.
