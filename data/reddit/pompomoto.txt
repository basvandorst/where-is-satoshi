AFAIK it's what the price is expected to be January 17th... So only a mild rise atm. Someone correct me if I'm wrong...
edit. So someone buying a a bitcoin future will agree to pay that price once the future expiry date takes place, i.e. 17th of January. If the Bitcoin has risen above that price at that date, he can make profit by buying at a lower price that was agreed upon (the future price).

Apparently there is a wallet:

Ok, cheers for the info

So around 1 hour to d-day?

What's the most secure / legitimate exchange for alternate coins? This Bittrex, or? I'd also like to look at making some long term bets on a few currencies...
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:17:01
Good to know that you can see the markets for every coin from there from now on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:40:12
Might, as a long term move.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:11:23
Remains to be seen in both cases. Would imagine BTC is the one that might be prone for a swing, up or down.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:50:55
Good call.

Futures price with a steady rise

Pissed I didn't jump on the IOTA train.. was planning to do so end of October (has jumped 10x since), but didn't trust Tether/Bitfinex, so left it at that. Funny enough Tether ended up having some kind of security breach, but I'm not sure if that affected users anyway...? Still, a sick bump.

Up and away

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it so that you'll only pay taxes on gains ONCE you've taken the fiat money (whatever your currency is) out of the system. You don't need to keep record of any of your buys/sells within the system. Your gains are in relation to the initial price point, i.e. the time you put money from your bank account into the exhange. If the coin price has increased above that and you sell some, and withdraw that money, that's when you need to pay the taxes. Right?

AFAIK Gdax is a better option for trading. If your plan is to do active trading, I'm not sure if there's any value in moving the money back and forth... I believe Coinbase is a wallet in itself (an online one), but if you mean some other, mobile or digital wallet, like said, I'm not sure if it's reasonable if you're actively trading. But do the trading at some other platform (like Gdax) that has lower fees. You'll easily end up losing money due to the fees in Coinbase, which is better for hodling, I believe.

What 'els033' said. Just let him know that bitcoin's future is still an unknown, but for the moment people seem to buy into it. I would probably also spill the beans in the sense that I'd ask him calmly what he hopes/tries to achieve with the constant comments. And that if his intention is to get you to stop you're not planning to do so for the moment, but that the constant commenting is a bit tiresome. Also, would probably calm his nerves by letting him know that you haven't (hopefully) bet your/their house in the market.

Ah.. Binance, thanks..
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:06:20
You can find it on Youtube. Just checked. Dude said basically that it's better than Bitcoin. Has 4 times more coins and is 4 times faster than Bitcoin, but that Bitcoin has the first mover advantage and is more well known.

Diversification panning out, I guess.. a bit of each, BTC, ETH and LTC
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:05:30
I'm just a crypto noob, but typically in markets, a so called "dominant design" establishes itself, which will crowd out the others. It doesn't mean there can't be variants though. But in terms of this "dominant design" it might come down to the technology that affects how quick the currency is among others. Could be so that several currencies are based on one same dominant technology in one area, but differ in some other aspect.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:25:20
When will such a thing take place?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:27:51
Good call.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:41:30
AFAIK if you want to trade, a better option is e.g. Gdax. But there are others as well. Coinbase has relatively big fees for each trade.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:43:59
Also interest in IOTA... Still only available on Bitfinex, or?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:37
Bought some BTC on Thursday, just before a dip... then slightly panicked and sold all and took a loss. Decided to soon hop back on, but this time spread it to ETH, LTC, BTC. As of now, somewhat lucked out, that the initial blunder made me diversify the next purchase. Just some food for thought for other people, i.e. might want to diversify a bit. AFAIK there's really no guarantee which of those three (if any) will even prevail, so by diversifying you might catch the right one, in terms of hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:33:02
Is the advantage of Gdax in fees and more advanced commands (stops, limits, etc.)?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:02
Remains to be seen, right? If the price keeps plummeting, they will have successfully shorted, and made money...
