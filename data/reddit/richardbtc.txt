It's 2016 now and the world realized it would be crazy to put record ever coffee purchase in the blockchain a couple of years ago.

I'm just wondering. Are you guys not getting bored creating posts that try to make it look like the sky is falling? 
@_date: 2016-03-11 13:48:38
Oh that's weird because I thought the HK miners announced they would not adopt Classic.  Did they mean they wanted bigger blocks but not Classic or something else.  Hope you can explain to me as I'm pretty new to this. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 04:16:01
lol - so true.  Now you'll just get the Classic guys latching on to this and using it for their non-stop marketing campaign.

If SegWit is to be implemented soon I am glad to hear they are not discussing it any more.  That's a sign there are few changes left and things are running smooth.

Your post has errors. For a start Blockstream is one company of many working on Lightning Network and it was not developed by them. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 08:04:39
That's not so expensive for a company budget.  Guess you just need them until you have got the votes then you can shut them down.

Probably that was the same thing that people said about email twenty years ago.  I think only time will tell just how integrated bitcoin will become.  Too early to say right now but I find it interesting that this browser will have an integrated bitcoin wallet.

Very excited to see what you are doing here. Some suggestions for your web page:
a) On your web site when I click "buy" it takes me to a buy page but the headers all disappear so there are no links to click at the top any more.
b) On your web site when I click "marketplace" there's a big search box at the top that masks all the headers.  Doesn't look good. Would be better to have that in the body of the page so I can still see the header. The three navigation bars as a way to make the search disappear were not obvious to me. 
c) I think your company has a blog or news page but can't find how to get that.  Would be nice to have a link for that at the top.
d) How about a link to the URL that shows fees.  Can't see how to get to that URL from your main site and can't remember the URL.
Looking forward to seeing the blog / news link so I can follow what's happening.  
Some suggestions for your company:
Frequent news announcements are really good. Better to have smaller announcements more often than big ones :-) 
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:49:14
Good to see new ideas but would it not be better if Gavin was to work WITH the the core developers so together they could brainstorm new possibilities. I read the summary of the core dev meetings and it seems those guys work together to come up with a solutions. Sometimes they agree, sometimes not but by talking to each other they can really do some great work.  Going out and doing stuff on your own with little feedback from your fellow developers is a recipe for disaster. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 13:43:52
Better tell coinbase that as there Blog says they have Gavin as an "advisor".  Don't advisors normally get paid?
@_date: 2016-03-12 01:37:46
I have seen a lot better tools. I don't see her as anything special at all. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 18:48:00
Adam, I wish you could put out more information like this on your company blog.  I realize a lot of your company plans may be confidential but by keeping quiet about everything you leave your company open to a lot of the haters here on reddit and to those people who feel that Blockstream is a company wanting to take over control of core. You have a great opportunity to let the world know about all of the great open source work that your your company is doing and about all of the new things that are coming up. The core guys changed the way they communicated to the world with bitcoincore.org. I hope you could do the same for your company. Just look at what the Bitcoin Classic guys are doing.  They have some terrible ideas (ok my opinion only) but they have so much PR out there that people listen to them more than the people with the good ideas.

Bitcoin micropayments collated over a month so there's not millions of transactions. Even without bitcoin wallet built in it's still a good browser.

Yeah right. 1 person at Blockstream working on lightning.  20 others not working for Blockstream working on it.  Try to get your facts right otherwise you appear as a fool.
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:52:48
LOL -  Trying to make another "sky is falling" post -)  These OMG we have to increase the block size last week marketing kind of posts are getting pretty boring these days.

Can someone explain to me what is meant by "merged" ?
@_date: 2016-03-11 04:34:59
Very true.  Many places are required to spend money on training and if targets are not met then the department manager is seen to be not meeting his objectives.  Some of the companies I worked in had huge budgets and so much money they didn't know what to spend it on.

Can you start up a few hundred more for 500KB blocksize nodes :-) 
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:18:24
I assume you mean segwit with core and miner majority agreed upon 2MB blocks in 2017.  Hopefully you're not still thinking about 8MB blocks (Bitcoin XT).  XT is dead now and Classic is about as dead as it can be except among a group of people who are promoting it for their own self interests. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:27:13
I have very much respect for all the hard working bitcoin developers but time and time again I feel nothing but disgust when I think about the way that Gavin is acting and the things that he is now doing to try and damage the bitcoin industry. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 02:27:39
How much have Blockstream contributed vs Coinbase.  My guess would be 100 times more.  If Coinbase were to contribute 100 times more to core code than Blockstream I think we'd take them seriously.  Oh and "Blockstream are not forking bitcoin".  Developers some of whom work for Blockstream are proposing changes which when debated and if accepted by the core developers with Bitcoin ack then they get added.

My understanding was that guests were each allowed to invite one other person and some guests invited them. I'm glad they were there as it gives us some insight into what happened.  There was also another member blogging about the event.  From his blog updates it sounded like the most boring event so far of 2016 and many made comments like that.

Of course you realize that we learned a lot since Satoshi made his intention clear.  Originally it was said the earth was flat.  Do you still believe in that or have you changed your mind?

Oh dear - Why would the reject a block size increase BIP when they have been telling us for the last 9 months that the block size must increase or the sky will fall.

Not sure but I think it's big news for the bitcoin blockchain.

coinbase is usually an easy way. Then transfer to a hardware wallet. Depending how much you buy I would not suggest keeping a lot on the phone.

@_date: 2016-03-10 02:45:06
How easy it is to say Gavin's warning's were ignored and there was a clear failure of planning.  It's March 2016 now and bitcoin has not failed even after spam transactions tried to make it fail. Coinbase tried, Gavin tried, Circle tried, Mike tried, Garzik tried to cause as much damage as possible. But in the end it didn't work and bitcoin is now stronger than ever and those guys are considered outcasts and fools by many. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:51:51
That really is an odd question but for the case of LN it's possibly because it could change the way people in the world transact with each other.

Good to hear from Sampson Mow. Everything he said makes sense!
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:56:07
Yeah I saw that and guessed it must be someone spinning up a lot of Classic nodes on the cloud or Raspberry PIs to make it look like Classic had support.  They must thing everyone is really dumb if we're going to believe that starting up lots of cheap nodes suddenly means they have a lot of support. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:52:30
Well looks like they lost big time.  All the Classic and XT stuff sounds like a joke now.  Even more so after I head that Mike Hearn quit bitcoin and went to join the banking sector.  Is Gavin still working for Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:07:31

Her show's supported by alt coins and that's what she promotes all the time.  No surprise there.   I used to listen to her but stopped after I got tired of hearing her non-stop promotion of alt coins.  Gets boring after a while.

Check the posters history.  In an earlier post about bitcoin he was saying:
It's shitcoin. It's not money.
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:49:25
When you say "many" do you mean by the exchanges like Circle (Mike Hearn's empoyer) and Coinbase (Gavin's employer) who would stand to gain the most from huge blocks and lower fees? I don't know much about this but from what I read it seems like the biggest supporters of the greater blocksize were those who would financially gain the most.  I feel good that the miners realize the strength of the network is more important than corporate profits for some exchanges.

A couple of questions. 
a) What will happen if Rootstock come out with a way to do everything that ethereum can do but using bitcoin?
b) Am I right in saying there's no cap to how many ether are created.  If that's the case why would anyone keep buying / pumping up the price?

That company seems to be doing real well. I have Trezor wallet but my next will be a Ledger wallet unless Trezor come out with something else and I might consider that. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:42:44
Can you explain what that has to do with the bitcoin blockchain?  I'm m getting a bit confused now. I thought there were some posts here talking about how it used the bitcoin blockchain.

Yeah I remember seeing his name appear on the Bitcoin Classic web page but then it was removed. Just that fact suggests something fishy to me.  Why would they try to hide the fact that he's part of the team?

It's just another FUD article.  I saw one like this just recently where the author was still saying 12 million coins so far mined.  Just rubbish reporting. I wonder if these guys get paid to report things like this?

Saving there money so they can spin up 10,000 nodes for a few days and claim to now have overtaken core.  Seems like a silly childish game to me but who am I to say. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:56:56
The most likely scenario is that we will have an average of ten FUD posts a day from Bitcoin Classic posters trying to think of ways to get everyone to switch away from core to untested Classic code being pushed by the big exchanges so they can maximise their profits. Just now I noticed another of these FUD posts by someone complaing about fees. They won't give up easy.  
@_date: 2016-03-10 02:24:41


I think this is interesting but have they made any contributions to core code.  Have they given any solid advice and suggestions other than to tell core they are not doing things the way they should be done.  I opened up a question on this forum to ask the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:38:00
Go ahead and use your credit card but don't complain here because nobody wants to hear whiners.

From my observation, watching my twitter feeds, reading here, reading the bitcoin slack and reading what I can in the media it would appear that there may be hundreds of knowledgable people who feel that this is not correct.  I thought we'd moved on from thinking that the most secure blockchain in the world would be used for coffee purchases after people realized that these things could be done through layer 2 solutions. What are the catastrophic flaws in the development process?  Are you saying that the 100+ contributors to core development (based on github contributions), university researchers publishing white papers, contributors to the bitcoin scaling meetings and workshops and 100s of of other developers working on second layer solutions have it all wrong.  Are you saying the majority of the miners have it all wrong and they should not be supporting the existing developers. If so then who are the people who have it right and who are the people that know best. Where are these people, where are there white papers, their presentations, why are they not showing themselves?  Sorry but I don't understand what you are saying. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 08:08:28
I am not sure but it seems like there's some vote manipulation going on here. I noticed there were 12 up votes and now it's down to five and looks like position of the posts supporting this investor have all moved up. Perhaps this will change but it's just an observation from watching what happened to this post.  Why would a person downvote a post like this when the post is just a question? 
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:44:39

@_date: 2016-11-13 06:02:33

@_date: 2016-11-13 04:47:07
Why would a paid troll do that :-)  These kind guys are nothing but altcoin pumpers and Roger's helpers. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:39:43
I don't understand this. If everyone wants to pay somebody many times a day how can the system stay small enough that other people can replicated the blockchain everywhere. Don't we end up with a blockchain that is so big that only a government can keep a copy.  Is this kind of small payment possible with litecoin or another coin. Just thinking that maybe it's possible with them and then u could show him how to convert back to bitcoin sometimes. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 07:20:38
I don't think the problem is as deep as this but I have seen cases where people have had problems for example with the opposite sex or a certain race and then from that time on they make it their mission to get back at those people in whatever ways they can. I think this is pretty common problem and would be interested to hear if there is a medical term for this.  If that person has power / money as in the case of some world leaders it can be a very serious problem. I feel worried that this might be the case here although another poster suggested that the reason may be that the investor has more to gain by causing disruption to the bitcoin community in such a way that people could move money from bitcoin into other investments and altcoins that they have a large stake in.
@_date: 2016-11-13 07:06:47
I recently saw a chart that showed transaction fees over the past few years.  I didn't see any increase at all and I think there was a slight decrease.  Maybe he's referring to some of the posters here who are trying to make it seem that fees are high be either giving false information or adding large fees on purpose so they can then post and show the transactions. I have been using Trezor for all my transactions and the wallet fees are very small. I send amounts of a few thousand dollars and pay almost nothing for the transfer.  Not sure why people keep saying a few dollars like this when 99.9% of the people don't seem to have any problem. Perhaps they need to look into what wallet they are using or something. Hopefully this poster will show some chart or statistics to back up what he's saying. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 06:45:29


Sorry but I don't understand. Just last week I read that a major exchange had started to use Sidechains. There are eight groups of people working on Lightning Network.  RSK are now testing out Tumeric.  Today I read that the Brave Browser has 18 thousand wallets created and it uses micropayments.  Last week I read that the yours network has working micropayments and I think 21.co have had micropayments working for some time now. Why do you say they are all vaporware when a few weeks ago there were examples of working LN demonstrated. Please again tell me who are the developers who have it right and who know best. I read a lot of posts from frustrated reddit people but what I need for my understanding is to be able to hear the best way to go from skilled developers and people in the industry.  I'm sure you can agree that nobody's going to take a no name reddit poster like me or you seriously. It's the developers we need to take advice from. Those who live and breath bitcoin development every day.  I'm just an observer in all of this and I can only learn from those skilled people and hope they can guide us all.

@_date: 2016-11-13 17:17:20
Hi, I didn't conclude they were vaporware. Actually the opposite as I keep seeing people say about different implementations of LN.  But there are a few people posting here who seem to keep saying everything is vaporware until it's in full scale use. They probably saying same for Segwit. I am not sure why as everything including the posters started off as vaporware. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:41:24
Why would someone not support segwit? I didn't hear any arguments against it and now I heard that every wallet company signed on github and said they plan to support. Are there many developers who think it is not a good thing? I didn't see any reports from them.
