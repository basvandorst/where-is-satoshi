That's why you can scan with the QR code.

It's not that bad, it'll just give more time for the developers to figure out the high transaction issue before everyone hops on it, trying to get rich quick.

that's what i'm thinking too. or any one of his family/friends/relatives. He should keep an eye out on anyone that magically becomes an overnight baller.
and OP should use the blockchain to track where your coins are going.

It's not really limited currency if the coins can be cloned, forked which is where the sea of shitcoins comes from.

It's obvious that it was the banks that caused the correction. Pumping up Ripple and then liquidating it. The BTC vs BCH was just a smokeshow.

Why did you need to use bitpay? Why couldn't you just send the amount directly? (and use Segwit)

You're just arguing about random semantic. Understand his main point. Just be in the green.

Holy shit. I just hope you didn't do it all at once. That's one hell of an impulse buy.
I'm more concerned of the impulse rather than the price you bought it at. It shows underlying concerns...

You just need to use seeds right? You don't need to export a private key?

You're just being a hater cause you're poor

Maybe this is how the bitcoin bubble will burst. Thank you for the mass confusion bcash.

Damn I want to buy some right now, but I used up my budget for the year. Sniff...

I technically didn't leave, but I don't plan to use them anymore. I'll just be using Shapeshift and Changelly cause I'm usually just redistributing my portfolio.

The BTC-BCH drama is toxic, but good gossip. It's one of the main reason the value shot up like 1000% this year. The whole bad publicity is still good publicity shtick.
