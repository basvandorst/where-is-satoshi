You seem to imply that the "honest/real miners" are the ones attacking the network, or changing the consensus rules. That is not what the network considers honest though.
If the miners in your example do not follow the network rules, my full node, along with every other one, will drop your miner from the network. 
Then, you can add blocks in a chain, that looks valid only to your miner.
UASF was not a lesson, or were you not in class that day?
Miners+full nodes+users are what makes the network secure. Lots of different miners, lots of full nodes and lots of users.
Also, decentralized, means that all these parts are controlled by different entities, on different geographical locations.
Not one party, in one datacenter. 10k AWS nodes and Jihan mining all the POW is not decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:33:52
I see you spouting this nonsense on almost every comment thread in this post, so I know you are neither a miner, nor are running a node.
Want to know how I know? You probably never tried to relay a tx anywhere before
Good luck relaying those txs through a network of nodes that will be dropping you like a bag of bcash

I concur, because I have been running some Quantitative Algorythmic Analysis Modelling and my findings appear to corroborate your results, or at least show support for such modularity in relevance to pear-shaped network effects, [as demostrated here](
Thus, in my view, a more refined approach is needed to counter the market-agnostic turbulence through max influx-driven input. The katatonic pressing on the Stochastic-RSI indicator, combined with the uncertainty as defined in the MFI Index and its non-relativistic derivatives point to a non-catalytic event, forming well within the next quarter

Bitcoin does not care if the users have political affiliations.

It does not care if you fund charities or war with it.
It trancsends the old world conventions and sets the foundation for whatever comes next

But its fundamentals are the same, the software knows no borders, and there is nothing taht can be done to uninvent it. It is not like the network can be stopped, seized or banned.

I don't need excuses for VISA, neither for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has been dirt cheap to transact with for almost nine years, with 99.9% uptime.
And even if you consider its almost two months of inflated fees "expensive",  it still was cheaper to transact with than CC or Paypal or every other centralized service.
Pretending otherwise is straight up hypocritical.


I beg to differ. High fees were artificially inflated and it is very relevant, as it was the only ammunition the anti-bitcoin crowd had. 
High fees were intentionally inflated by the people collecting those fees. It's not hard to see their empty blocks being mined when the chain was overloaded, while at the same time crying "high fees"
And they are still using it as an excuse, to point out that something is wrong with the protocol.
Meanwhile, the largest centralized service &amp; wallet provider in the ecosystem, *cough coinbase cough*, still refuses to implement protocol upgrades that will alleviate those issues.

Buying bitcoin is a safe option. You get the amount of coins you feel safe with, either to use or just test the waters.
Mining is a whole other level
Mining profitability hinges on many other factors, like cost of electricity, cost of acquiring ASICs, potential price hikes, overall network difficulty among other things.
It might make sense to have a miner as a hobby project and gradually expand. It won't make you reach overnight, but with Bitcoin reaching the moon, you'll be glad you did.
Besides, even one more machine in a different household helps decentralize the network further
Hobbyists are running small scale mining ops at homes and basements, using the heat of the machines to warm their houses or using their excess power production on their machines.
Don't just fall for the "mining is unprofitable" angle without looking at it from multiple perspectives

Kinda like how Korea/Japan took over last time PBOC was after the exchanges, halting withdrawals etc

bitcoin is a decentralized protocol, it cannot be banned.
They can regulate the exchanges, impose fees, taxes, make them accessible only to "accredited investors"
The end result will be decentralized exchanges rising in volume sooner

He is correct, if the market prefers 2X it can go ahead and buy it from Jihan.
But why does Jihan, after he got his wish granted and made bch a reality with bigger blocks, less fees, $uper $atoshi, keep on pressuring to gain control of btc?

Check out theDAO history.
A smart contract was deployed and got huge funding.
Alas, the code was not tested rigorously enough and there was an exploit that was discovered too late. 
Someone took advantage of it and started draining the funds from the contract.
The developers decided to roll back the chain, and thus ETC was born,  as the ethereum chain without the rollback
ETH has been stained ever since because it was proven that it is not immutable.

I really dont understand the notion that bitcoin will "decimate the ability to fund through taxation" or rogers' "bitcoin will stop wars" 
Governments soon will accept bitcoin for taxes and i can buy a gun with bitcoin. 
Bitcoin will be used both to pay taxes and fund wars, it's obvious.
And dont get me started on the simple fact that taxes  =/= corrupt politicians. Taxes are not to be blamed if your elected representatives are scumbags like roger. 
Are you american?
You need to think these propositions through

they are an MLM, BitClub Network
stay away
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:55:31
His stand says it all, this is an "independent associate" of the BitClub Network, an MLM pyramid scheme with affiliates all over the globe, disguised as a cloud mining operation.
They are a fucking pyramid scheme. There is a BitClub mining pool with some decent hashpower that you can point your miners at, but if you dont have miners, and follow his "Business Investment Seminars" you will find out that you can buy hashpower in the cloud from him. They had three lifetime contracts wen someone approached me a few months ago, worth 2k, 5k and 10k euros at the time, that would buy you "lifetime hashpower in the Bitclub Network Mining Operation", but the contracts do not even define the amount of hashpower you would rent and you could not verify you owned it, or point it somewhere yourself. 
You would send bitcoin to their address, provide them with your address and receive faucet payouts for the next ten years, without never reaching ROI
And then they inform you that you can have bonus payouts for every customer you bring in downline from you, and you will have massive bonuses from every member your referred buyer brings along, and more bonuses for family and friends, and before you know it, your coins are gone
The guy who approached me gave me his business card. It read "BitCoin Miner"
Fuck that cancer

Look up Gekko, Tribeca or Zenbot in Github.
They all are open source, fully customizable if you like getting your hands dirty and can connect to most exchanges.
There are paid solutions as well out there, like HaasOnline or Gunbot.
Keep in mind, none of them is a foolproof money making machine. They require understanding of both how markets work/behave as well as some badic understanding of what the code can or cannot do. 
Also they need to be monitored, especially during volatile periods because the market can suddenly change and rape them. 
If you know the basics of trading, a decent bot will help a lot.

My point is that your analogy of those social media platforms as pro-Democrat sockpuppets is flawed.
The world does not revolve around the States, and the Democratic National Convention is a very small subset of the US, while the US is a small subset of the userbase of those platforms.

if you google them, you'll find thousands of pages of "affiliates" in all the languages of the planet
All the pages are non-descriptive, vague landing pages. You cant buy anything, nor learn anything on the landing page, because you need a code to move forward.
You get that code from the guy in the stand. They are screening "customers" this way and making sure that the "select few" that will be  given the go-ahead to enroll in the "investment" are people with not a freaking clue about bitcoin or bitcoin mining at all. The people I have seen in the area I live that gave money to those scammers were mostly older people, that had some investing experience and were looking for an easy way into bitcoin. 
They sell "hashpower" to "investors" that do not realize that while they are allegedly adding more miners with your money, its pool hashpower is remaining the same
These scammers will deal with the hassle of mining on non-existant hardware, for a fee, you'll get rich for nothing by giving them your coins /s

Why would any sane person want to have access to an open distributed decentralized permissionless borderless peer2peer payment network which is able to operate 24/7/365 globally that can be sent to anyone on the planet in a few moments without the need of a central authority instead of a centrally owned and controlled form of currency whose authorities can arbitrarily take it off your hands if you dare to spend it on anything that is not approved by a governing body is beyond anyones imagination
