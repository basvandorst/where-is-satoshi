Lol just got an automoderator post that this thread is being deleted for being about an altcoin. Oh the irony..

Maybe he's just trying to get a better feel for the markets. I often look at my portfolio, not because I'm worried about profit/loss, but because I want to observe changes and try to get a better idea of how the market behaves on a daily basis and in different situations. (Ie. corrections, rebounds, spikes, etc.)

Why's that exactly?

There's a project that's trying to integrate crypto into satellites and use a 3D language instead of binary for faster, and smaller (data size) transactions. I wont name drop, because I'll seem like a shill..

Weak hands are greedy hands that are extremely reactionary. Panic sell when it's falling, and then buy AFTER you notice it going back up and everyone's jumping back on the bandwagon. Yeah, it's a silly way to invest. Most of those weak hands are then the people who cry on forums about it being a 'scam' because they lose money trading poorly by following the flock.
