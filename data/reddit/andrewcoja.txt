Except for when it didn't get stronger and took a big nose dive that one day and several other days.

What is it exactly you think regulations do? Regulations are what make the free market work. They do the exact thing you think people will do to police themselves.
Here's an important life lesson for you: No one is nice, everyone is an asshole. Every transaction you make that isn't a set price involves the other person trying to screw you over. Regulations exist so if you get scammed, you can get reparations.

I highly suggest you take all your money out of bitcoin and then take it to an investment firm. You don't know how to invest and you are losing your own money. Have a professional invest for you. And no, this is not the time to try to convince Morgan Stanley that bitcoin is the future. This is the time for you to stop being an idiot with your money and have someone who kknows what they are doing to invest your actual dollars.

I bought a computer with 5 goats and six mules. Then I killed the guy and took the goats and mules back. Good thing farm animals don't have chargebacks.

The free market isn't something that was invented five years ago, it's been going on for thousands of years. The reason why we have laws and regulations because the invisible hand of the free market doesn't do anything to stop fraud and theft. You might think at attaching a scammer tag to someone is doing anything at all but it doesn't. If it is a good scammer, a few opinions won't matter if they can play their cards right. Even if you get rid of one scammer, two more will take his place.
Why do you think we have any kind of law or social order in the first place? They exist to protect people. There have been tricksters and cheats as long as there has been something to scam for. The only thing that protects you from being cheated every day are the regulations you hate so much. In a completely free market, you can do whatever you want with impunity. Especially on the internet. In the past, if someone caught on to your scam, you have to skip town and start up somewhere new. Now all you have to do is make a new screen name and find a new proxy.

I'll bet your son learned a lot about cryptography when he started mining something that happens to have the word crypto in its name. I also learned about cryptozoology from bitcoin.

Yes a top down declaration of something that is not allowed like not allowing someone to create a transaction and then create the same transaction again to scam someone. Though maybe that's a civil law and not a magical rEgUlAtIoN that only does bad things and never does good things.

That's what regulations do. Here's the first definition I found for regulation: a law, rule, or other order prescribed by authority, especially to regulate conduct.
Sounds like selling aluminum as silver or trapping people in an exchange would fall under conduct.

Haha, log into Magic The Gathering Online Exchange again. That's a good joke.

I knew GOX was shady because it was based off trading virtual cards from Magic The Gathering Online.

You probably have debt because you are irresponsible with money. Unless it is a car note or home loan, which aren't bad to have.
