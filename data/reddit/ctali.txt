Also remind me one week 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:03
Lol you'll make your own opinions and they're valid. Ive not put anything in bcash although I did think about it. After their antics today I'll not go near them. But that's me 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:27
They've tried to manipulate the market and force a Bitcoin crash and I feel coinbase is in on this too. A planned attack 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:54:49
I've been using binance, feel free to use my referral code 11299706

Let's goooooo
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:48
What's the point of posts like this? Just contributing to the echo chamber? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:36
Don't panic! What happened? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:47:25
Use gdax! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:21

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:43:27
I did that, took 2 days 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:58
I would avoid for now... It's actually dropping slowly. Don't trust their games
