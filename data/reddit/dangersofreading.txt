Um, just making sure - you know that "less than 300%" figure is already inflation-adjusted, right? That it wasn't like prices went up 224% in general and "less than 300%" for tuition? That in actuality, prices went up 224% (CPI-U-RS says only 184%), but 1000% and more for tuition?

Guess what - it's inflation-adjusted data. It shows how much education costs went up compared to the prices of other things (food, cars, homes etc). It doesn't show how much education costs went up in dollars. For public universities, it was $800 in 1980-1981 and $9970 in 2017-2018. So it increased 12.44 times (by 1144%).
Adjusting for inflation is multiplying that $800 by a factor of about 2.7, and that's how they got the value of $2196 in the article you linked. So, inflation-adjusted, it increased 4 or 5 times (by 300-400%).
If you include private universities (costs there went up too, but by less %) and use a slightly different timeframe, you may even arrive at less than 300%.
But - you used to pay 800 nominal dollars for a public uni. Now you pay 9970.
Look for my other post in this thread for sources.

It's only 1144%, according to my calculations. For public universities.
$801.35 in 1980-1981, $9970 in 2017-2018. Sources for the $801.35 figure: 1) [ 2) [

Nominal cost of public uni in 1980-1981: $801.35. Adjusted for inflation it's $2196 in 2014-2015 and $2275 in 2017
Nominal cost of public uni in 2014-2015: $8534
Nominal cost of public uni in 2017-2018: $ 9970
How it changed from 1980-1981 to 2017-2018: 1144% in dollars (nominal); 338% inflation-adjusted.
(288.6% is the number you get if you stop at 2014-2015 and use inflation-adjusted data)

MarcBago: No, $801 in 1980 dollars is about $2275 in 2017 dollars.
