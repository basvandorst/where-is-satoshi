I just want it to be $100k

Dude coming from the stock market I can literally say that waiting most of the time is the best. You can not guarantee the price will go back up in two months time neither you can say it will be lower. The volume is generally decreasing but a person should be able to read the parameters at least for a week. After that if one wants to sell or hold that is respectable. But calling everyone to public execution with pitchforks can only hurt few people here. If they are already undecided they can just go ahead and sell for a loss. Just wait. Actually forget it. see it as an long investment or marriage.

First thing first; I am not here to argue you and English is not my mother tongue so if I sound offensive I am already sorry for that. I will try to sound calm.
Secondly, Americans are pretty much underestimating this "inflating" issue. You guys do not think about the other countries, other markets and the heavy expectations of the people from developing countries. People are crazy buying in my country right now I am using paribu.com (if you would like to check it out). Plus there are predictions I really trust:
and I think we may already dipped 
What I am saying is that being calm is the best in these situations
I am coming from these kind of disasters; coin investors generally underestimate stock market and just like you said they also think it is "safe" and "regulated" but in the end when you lose quarter for a paper, gov will not show up to hug you.

You are aware that even the 24 hour volume of BitCoin is larger than some countries economies, right? That money is not going anywhere. It is just changing hands.

RemindMe! 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:44:08
If this dip lasts more than a month then it is correction. If it all blows over in a week or so; you are in the wrong. Correction means dropping suddenly and staying in the same place for a good time and yes you are right it is healthy but this time the demand is way higher than you can anticipated and this dip imo is just a manipulation because a correction in these volumes would be literally magnificient where you would have to stay in 9k for months. But what you see here 14k again.
Tl;dr you are wrong

Yeah man definitely.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:08:37
Yup, it is all going to be downhill from here, might as well hold for long term.

As an Economics degree holder, I cried a little bit.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:59:04
As a Turk I can clearly say that this is a trap.

We (Turks) have a lot of common words with Persian that is why I asked, thabk you!
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:34:47
I am a Turk and just like everything Erdogan does this is also a trap.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:02:22
Does “arz” mean supply?
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:51:14
Government supported decentralization?
Like centralized decentralization?
China must be a massive joke.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:31:26
The thing is that Erdogan is pissed that he cannot tax bitcoin. He is trying to impose it as “comodity” but then again he cannot follow all the alt-currencies especially when you are trading on platforms like binance. 3 times in a row he has “ordered” to find a way to impose tax on it, I am pretty sure his goal is only but only putting some taxes on bitcoin in some way. Plus the Turkish central bank may seem objective and independent but the political influence of Erdogan is just so much that he can basically make them do whatever he wants.

As for my knowledge I do not own or even work for a bank but I am going to buy shit tons this time
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:42:01
I have lost a bit, I am willing to lose a bit more, so count me in.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:12:32
Mate if I was an american or even from a western country I would rub it all in your face.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:25:27
As of today I have also completed my goal of 0.1, too!
We are now bitcoin brothers!
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:55:36
Oh my god! Are you even real?
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:43:17
Mate whatever you believe in, do not call other people out for it. You may not believe in moon landing, you may think 9/11 was an inside job, you may think jesus was fake, you may believe frogs are holy... but just be kind to people whatever they believe in.
Secondly, mate come on... I mean, come on... also, come on... finally, come on...

No what I am saying is having nukes does not guarantee you to the “moon”

Think about Korean Won being so successful that they create WonCash and WonGold.

Are you an idiot? What is your point, idiot?
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:05:03
Oh my god you are indeed serious. Please just talk to me because I envy people who does not believe the science tthat their country has created. My country is shit and we will like never ever be on outer space. But you are claiming something your country totally did as a lie. I would be super duper proud if my country pulled something like that off

Decentralization in China
Let me laugh a bit,
Oh, you are serious
Let me laugh even harder.

You are not a scammer mate, there was a scammer who deleted his comment. I am sorry if that was misleading.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:38:56
Is this a joke?
Edit; it is not he is a scammer
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:06:43
Mate I mean it is not make it easier for you, but I am genuinely sorry for you. Just think it like it was a one time huge thing that you ever wanted to buy. It may make you feel better.
And I hope you gain more than you lost!
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:09:39
Coming from a poor family (and being the only sibling) my parents always wanted me to be successful, but of course I turned out to be a loser. I just want their last 10 years on earth to be rich, I wanna be able to support them so that they can at least travel the world. After they are gone I can even be a homeless, that is really not important. But right now I really need that money.

@_date: 2018-03-05 18:18:05
Nah mate I am a libertarian, we are basically supporting same things.
But you know this “guy” had one-day-old account and was saying “send me 0.01 eth I will send you 0.1 eth (or some crap like that)” it turns out he was banned.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:34:12
Are you serious?

I mean I am not a rich person, so my “shit ton” is not really that much :/

It just needs a bit time and stock market stability. Plus American domination in Syria would be also pretty good.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:17:26
You dont like when it pumps you definitely do not like when it dumps, you do not like continuous pumping and wait for dumping, you do not like repetitive dumping and wait for pumping, you do not like occasional price shift, you do not like staying at equilibrium for long period of time.
There is literally no winning on this sub.
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:46:45
1.6 billion people is the number of people who believe in Islam (arguably), and almost 40% of that population lives under secular governments where sharia law is just a joke. If we are not talking about Saudi Arabia &amp; Iran or Pakistan we should not even talk about Sharia law. 
So yeah this story is bullshit.

Oh sorry I thought you were bitching about the market trend, here have an upvote and my apology.
