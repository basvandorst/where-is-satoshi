Thank you so much. 
I see I have a LOT to learn. 
I'm picking up that a huge part of being in crypto is learning to read some code and also taking some responsibility for mining. 
Not quite there yet!

Get a new wallet and new keys. 
Move all your BTC out before you move the BCH. 
I moved my BTC but I'm still not ready to mess with the BCH.

The more we use it the better, I believe. 
I'm waiting for my Shift card from Coinbase.
Then I'll buy everything with crypto. 
It's not ideal, or purist, I suppose. 
But I figure if it all goes straight into Bitcoin and I spend from that I have to get ahead somewhere.

It's not a matter of "let". 
It's a matter of bitcoin can't be stopped. 
Do you really believe the Chinese will no
longer engage in p2p transactions?

You can't give someone freedom though. 
People aren't going to quit btc just because it's banned.

I just got the ChainBytes wallet. 
It has a QR scan feature that lets you read what's in the paper wallets without messing with blockchaininfo. 
I'm loving it.

"But these other virtual currencies do not have as many followers as Bitcoin, so they are not worth as much. As in the real world, a currency is worth only as much as the number of people willing to accept it for goods and services."
The value of a currency isn't dependent on the # of people who are willing to accept it. 
The author also implied that Bitcoin exchanges are not legal.

  Jamie Dimon threatened to fire anyone trading Bitcoin, and now all of the JP Morgan associated investors are selling all their bitcoin. 
It's very relevant to bitcoin.

I don't get the paper fail. 
Pay attention to where you keep your important papers. 
Store duplicates.

Oh my God. 
I would never keep anything I wasn't about to use on an exchange. 
Especially in this regulatory atmosphere. 
Good luck to you with that.

That sounds brilliant. 
I'm so HODL, but when I learn more I'll definitely invest more.
