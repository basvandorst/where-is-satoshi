If you know that it's going to continue to fall, why wouldn't you wait?

That's the thing. You read it and assume that he thinks it will continue to go down, but someone else may read it that it certainly will go down because of how assertive he sounded. I think it's more productive to say that he will "keep buying *if* it continues to go down". I already understand the potential benefits of buying more as it goes down, I just don't like when people on here talk with too much certainty.

When you say "I will continue to buy more as it falls" sounds like you're just contradicting yourself.

The "trolls" you speak of were always here, they're just not being downvoted for voicing their concern at the moment.

40k in debt. Using money you don't have to invest in something so risky is almost never a good idea.

Do what you want, but it worries me when I hear you say "What's another 2k". When you start thinking like that, you may start saying repeating that phrase more and more when you have more money to spend, when you should've been using it to pay off your loan.

Yea, but people don't call the stock market a currency.

You can say the same thing about the stock market. It's been around a lot longer and these kinds of things still happen. This is something that you have to get used to because it's not going to stop.

I remember a post here saying bitcoin was on sale when it dropped to 17k
