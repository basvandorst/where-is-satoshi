Eruptors won't work for litecoins, there's two types of coins (from my study)
SHA-256 - this is bitcoin and a select others. These are the ones you can use Eruptors on or any other ASIC hardware
Scrypt - these are the coins that only work with GPU or CPU's only.
I recently jumped on this bandwagon and i obtained a USB eruptor for about 15 usd. Sadly, with the readily availability of ASICS this is nothing compared to what most people are using, hence, it makes little difference. The biggest profiteers right now are the companies who buy tons of this hardware, and those who manufacturer it - you can guarantee they keep stock aside for their own personal use.
So far my experience of cryptocurrency hasn't been all that great in all honesty. I kinda feel like i'm participating in a race where everyone else has the head start, and unless i invest in considerable amounts of money - which I don't have - into ASIC hardware, i'm not going to see any real return.
Honestly, i think your best strategy - including my own - is to wait for bitcoin to depreciate in value and then buy a few, and then hope it goes back up again.
You could always mine other altcoins though. Currently all i have to my name is 2000 ASICcoins and about 7 PPC in my Cryptsy account. this is after a months continued mining.

I suggest a "Who has the least bitcoin" post, so far i sit at a comfortable 0.00003037 BTC.
If anyone is feeling generous and wish to give a bit of excitement into my dreary life, i'd very much appreciate some loose btc coinage thrown my way:
Anyone who makes any considerable donations i'd very much like to know, so i can share my thanks (and, eventually, return the favor) once i get my BTC investment rolling

So, in essence, the currency is being manipulated.
