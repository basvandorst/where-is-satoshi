How do we warn people of this?

ISIS is an English acronym.

They want to be called by their full name. Daesh isn't the full name either. I thought you knew that because you said they want to be known as Islam and a State.

Nope. You're good at this.

I'm not reading that trash again. That article can be reduced by 90-95% and convey the same meaning. The explanation is so far removed, that it takes multiple hoops to assume someone speaking Arabic would joke about.
ISIS in Arabic is not ISIS. ISIS wants people to call them Islamic State in Syria. But in Arabic. Whatever. It's probably worse for ISIS for people in the West to call ISIS, Daesh, because Westerners don't understand Arabic. People speaking Arabic say Daesh because it's a shortened version. Sort of like an acronym. I'm sure ISIS would prefer Westerners to say something like "Islamic State".
This comment is [wrong](
This is [right.](
This is [right but the same person as before that was wrong.](
In conclusion, I don't know why you replied to him and then replied to me about something that the person you were replying to wasn't even talking about.
Most people seem to get it, since those two comments were upvoted, so I wrote these comments to stop the future misinformation. I was hoping you would understand so I would not have to write so much.

That doesn't sound like something I can control. I'm not part of the media.

You person you replied to was talking about Arabic, and you then also talked about the Arabic "acronym", Daesh. But then you replied to me talking about the word ISIS, which is English.


I don't think that's the only journaljst that talks about that, and the article explains it differently, so I did not quote it entirely. I didn't saying anything about "destructive monsters".


I meant [this comment]( I copied yours by mistake.


I can't tell if you are aware that Daesh is in Arabic and ISIS is in English because ISIS wants to justify their regime by being called the Islam State of whatever. Which you said in your own comment. And I said that you were agreeing with that guy because 




mean the same thing.
And in a later comment you said 


Which is English. And which I replied to saying that Westerners saying ISIS instead of Daesh is good for them because it implies their full name that is understood in English. But you and the other guy were talking about the word Daesh, not ISIS, so your reply was out of context.
Overall, I wanted you to see how much more simple the words are. Daesh doesn't like being called Daesh by Middle Easterns because it doesn't imply their full name, but not in the same way that ISIS, the acronym in English, does.

Aren't you agreeing with the person you replied to?

So we need to make voting interesting by showing how it is exciting. I wonder if people on social media have forgotten about bitcoin.
The media doesn't report on the same things that people on reddit are heavily interested in, even if they are significant topics in real life news around the world. They often skip over whatever does not interest their demographic. As an unrelated example: US tv channels stop showing the Olympic games or World soccer games once the US is not prominent.

What's the plan to get people interested in anything other than netflix?

It almost sounds like, the journalist ethical code; to check with multiple sources before reporting.
