I answered that already,  its unique chemical properties that make it useful in industry and its rareness.

Im not sure you understand how currencies work.  Also, you can do all thy with any currency.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:16:58
Price surges reflect the devaluation of fiat currencies as gold is used as a hedge.  Not sure why im getting so much hate im just trying to understand bitcoins but it looks like i was right in assuming its just a fad.  Didnt it get hacked earlier this tear as well?  By all means you guys can use it all you want, i dont care, but to give it the same credence as other REAL fiat currencies is naive.

Im sorry but that doesnt explain anything.  Read my other comment.  Fiat currencies have underlying backing by nations.

What gives bitcoin its value? Serious question.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:36:55
Not really. Money is backed by the underlying country's assets, ability to produce goods and services, social and economic stability. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:46:56
You trust it because it has the backing of a nation. Also, gold is used as a currency hedge and has that ibtrinsic value.

Fist currency is backed by the underlying nations wealth and overall economic snd social stability.

The underlying countries assets, production capabilities, economic and social stability.

Until somebody hacks that encryption like they did earlier this year, right?  Also, who prevents the owners of that encryption and its facilitating hardware from just taking it all? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:44:26
So then bitcoin is worthless because it cant produce goods and services, has no labor force,  has no central government and has no reputation?  Loly
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:06:37
Actually what gives the dollar value is the underlying wealth and societal stabiitu of the inited states.

Krugman is a friggin hack.  Nobody should take him seriously.

Crony capitalism at its worst.

Lol, luckily for me I don't give a shit about meaningless Internet points.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:34:17
What's funny is that it's barely a currency.  I equate it to beanie babies. A fad. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:36:46
LOL,  this shits a giant scam.  I hope people don't put money that can't lose into it. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:19:44
Lol, total sham.
