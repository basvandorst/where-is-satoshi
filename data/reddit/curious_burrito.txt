Good to know. My only concern is the future of bitcoin and its acceptance as a real currency.

Well said.

I agree with you here, and the fact that Coinbase is the easiest way for new investors. I do however believe that Coinbase has done some shadier things about the market. Good argument though.

The climb will be slow and steady, better than it just plateauing then dropping followed by a huge hike.

The winter solstice represented the coming dark days ahead. Some celebrated, made offerings, or despised it because of this.

is accurate because people who have been on board for a while are fairly comfortable. While people who watched it (but didn't buy Bitcoin because they were young or not sure enough.) or just recently found out about it are screwed over in the fees.

His argument is rather strong, even though I disagree. Yours though, seems to appeal to emotion and paranoia.

Until you understand the economy, you cannot truly help the poor.

Do you have any doubt that Bitcoin will become not only the most dominate Crypto, but also eventually replace fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:12:28
I predicted it would, which is why I decided to invest now rather than earlier.

Seeing as gold has moderate on counterfeiting, I agree. You ever see someone counterfeit gold?

It’s about control. Probably.

This applies better to Dogecoin.

As a resident of WV, the state that called the guard in to deal with opiates, this is the biggest load of garbage ever. No one buying drugs here uses BTC, and suppliers don’t use it because dealers don’t use it, they use cash.

Have to disagree there, it can be duplicated, but it wont do as well.Bitcoin was first, and if it fails, why would people trust a perfect duplicate.

You should realize


* A.that Bitcoin is an excellent representation of the health of all cryptos, like The Dow, or S&amp;p 500 are good representation of the market in general, and receives news coverage accordingly.


* B. The whole point of Bitcoin was to evolve, grow, and become a secure online currency.


* C. Bitcoin will replace Fiat, Bitcoin is the New, Fiat is the old.

I honestly don't know, I'm merely stating it is possible, not probable.
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:15:01
Honestly I guessed it would fall at the start of 2018, but the number was sharper than expected and I'm upset I didn't short it. For personal gain though, I have supported Bitcoin since 2013 and predict it will do well.
