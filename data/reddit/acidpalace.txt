I don't remember the exact wording but it was something about a transaction with an address with known criminal activity or something. Also they said I broke the user agreement and had to move all my coins immediately.

Coinbase closed my account after I bought drugs

First of all, what I was buying wasn't even scheduled drug. Secondly, it was a very small amount which was obviously for personal use. Finally, I just said that I had no idea what I was doing.

I don't know about that. Stocks have treated me much better than bitcoin!

I'm just hoping it goes up enough to pay off my student loans in the next couple years lol

Yes I am sure. I double and triple checked lol. They wanted to take 0.005 BTC for the transaction fee. I could screencap it if you want. It would be essentially half of the BTC in that wallet just to pay the fee! It is a pretty shitty online wallet IMO.
