For all you know this money could have went to video games or some other hobby instead of Bitcoin. Just because he has to sell now doesn't mean it was bill money that was invested, but now that he needs money, it's becoming bill money. Don't be such a condescending ass.

This whole article is a joke. I can only assume this moron self publishes because no one else wants his drivel on their site. Poor editing and pointless analogies.

Market manipulation can exist in a free market, you can't just write everything off as being a part of the free market and pretend like people aren't selling with the intention of moving the price down.

The whole article was so redundant and lacking in any new information; this moron just regurgitates old information to promote his narcissistic position as someone worth listening to. The author is a hack.

A large market cap is necessary for a lot of Bitcoin's potential to be reached, so don't ostracize people who want to discuss the price, it's a discussion that belongs here just as much as anything else. Suggesting people only discuss price on a separate subreddit is ridulous. Bitcoin is a financial technology, price is integral. If you don't like these kind of posts, just move on down the page and click something else.

The timing of the sell-off, a Saturday night in the U.S./ Sunday morning in Asia, was pretty clearly timed to tank the market when as few traders as possible were paying attention. This is just more market manipulation from the shorts. They've got the market in the palm of their hands, and until demand increases, they're going to keep playing these games.

Do you have another word for it?
