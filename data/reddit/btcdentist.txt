Hey guys, I just took down the duplicate post since it seems like alot of folks here seemed bothered by that.  I just wanted to post the link to my patient's Imgur photos, that was all. Guess you can say I was pretty pumped about completing a bitcoin transaction. I never thought anybody would ever use it as a payment method. Which is why we wanted to document the whole thing and share it online. 
The whole thing was pretty straightforward. He had a coinbase account and wanted to pay using coin rather than traditional visa/mastercard. The transaction fees are cheaper so why not? 
I'm a big fan of btc and what it potentially stands for, which is why I agreed to accept it. I could have easily just have taken cash in USD, but if given the opportunity- why not support a new more honest system?

Uh no... He does not have a reddit account. I merely posted the link on reddit to his Imgur photos. That was my link. and the title was just the same as the title to his Imgur photos. Since the link is already on this thread, I just figure I clarify that. - why are there so many trolls on here? lol

If they establish the new Islamic Caliphate, we might see the very first nation-state (sunni-state) to adopt bitcoin as its national currency.
1. We obviously know they use smartphones over there since they post execution videos like kobe bryant highlight reels.
2. In a war torn lawless state. Btc in a bip38 paper wallet is the only way to store your meager life savings. Libertarian anarchists hold btc precisely in anticipation of something like ISIS happening over here.
3. They need a currency to transact w quick in order to rebuild their economy fast. There is no better stable currency ready for mass use and adoption like btc. The petrodollar is done. And they know this.
I hate these animals. But its a civil war over there. We shoudnt be surprised to see a new Saddam emerge to enforce stability. One big cycle back to the beginning. Maybe they can build their new nation off the right way by adopting btc.

I understand the community is wary of any bad publicity stunts. This was not my intention. I believe in this protocol. Unlike many merchants I do not convert my coins into fiat. I intend to use them to buy items and services from future bitcoin merchants. I hold them because I believe in its power as a store of value in the long run. I'm just damn proud to have completed a real btc-for-work-transaction and wanted to post about it. Did not expect this kind of reaction from my fellow bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:34:52
Uh... okay my friend. I know you are angry that the price of btc is falling. The title of the reddit post was the same as the title of my patient's Imgur post. I could have retitled it as "here's the Imgur Link.." I did not intend to try to fool you or anyone else, I just wanted to have a direct link to my patient's Imgur posts. As for privacy concerns, no we are not breaking any HIPAA laws as no specific treatments detail were released.

April15 doesnt change anything. This is simply engineered panic allowing big chinese players to scoop up cheap coins. Anyone who thinks china is leaving is naive. They'll prob create the next bubble wave thus bringing more americans into the space. And we'll see another crash once the chinese have pumped the price up enough only to dump it on dumb americans. Then once again rebuy in at a cheaper price. Lord knows how long this manipulation will go on.

 Right now I'm sleeping in fiat and waiting for the crash to rebuy for double. I laugh at those who think this is a crash. Were not even close to the bottom. Just convert to fiat. Turn off your computer, go outside and exercise, get a girlfriend and check back in two months later for the rebuy.

Even if they don't ban, btc is downtrending. As a merchant and trader I feel the community overestimated the network speed of bitcoin. Bitcoins market value rely on the volume and velocity of transctions. We may not be seeing this take off. Majority of users are speculators &amp; hoarders. Cash is still easiest way to transact.When you do a fibonacci retrace from the 2013 upward trend, we looking at 325 mid-may.

So let me get this straight...? You are accusing me of "making up this whole bitcoin dental transaction" To somehow promote some bogus bitcoin for dental work treatment? Gee... read the title of my patient's Imgur Link. I copied and pasted that and then linked it on to Reddit to just share with the reddit bitcoin subforum. I must be trying to fool you guys...

As a dentist who accepts bitcoins. My advice is: "your good health is worth more than satoshi's private keys" 
Im just waiting for Ethereum to kill off HMOs. We will see crowdfunded healthcare plans held together by self executing contracts. 
As far as accepting bitcoins in my practice, I havent had a single patient who uses bitcoins. I accept it solely for moral and ideological purposes. I feel like I am a valuable merchant helping this community grow.

Bitcoin is a hedge against fiat. For one btc to reach tens of thousands of dollars. The USD needs to become the peso. Which at that point you would never sell. BtC I feel like is some wallstreet forex trader's revenge against QE.

The Chinese really do see America as a passing aberration in history. You have to realize China was the largrst empire for 18 centuries until they missed the industrial revolution and the West ruled the 19th century America ruled the 20th. The Chinese are making the same mistake by missing the bitcoin revolution. Hubris.
Chinese felt poised for the fall of USD and rise of RMB. They gotta be shocked to find that this BTC will supplant all fiats. If they choose to ignore they will get left behind again.

I agree. Im only buying. Never spending my coins. As a day to day currency it has a long way to go. I see it as buying stock in the ultimate IPO. This IPO valuation is based off its network power . Same as facebooks valuation. Except facebook is just trendy garbage. Whereas btc will let me convert my life savings into RMB once the dollar tanks. Will give my kids a future.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:22:46
I feel that all hoarders are doing is feeding this bubble. The IRS reg that btc is property is currently correct. BTC ultimately will be a international money wire system. Where people only use the blockchain to convert in and out of different fiats across countries. Our daily digital currency will most likely be an altcoin sometime more like doge.

I just want to live to see the day DAC's and Ethereun kill off HMOs and private insurance companies. I want these greedy scumbag businessmen who profit off other people health misfortunes to be homeless and begging on the streets for work. I believe Ethereum will kill off lawyers and MBA scum. God bless you Satoshi. Thank you Vitalik. For you developers out there create a DAC asap and solve Americas healthcare problem. Obamacare is a taxpayer handout to the private insurance companies and a complete joke. We need DAC developers to solve this.

I am a dentist who accepts btc. 
I am on coinmap and the only dentist in Orange County,CA accepting btc.
I believe dentists will be the first group in healthcare to accept btc bec we own our practices and don't answer to some hospital executive.
I could care less about taking btc for the money. I prefer cash for my services, but I believe in the promise of btc's potential and want to see this ad-hoc economy make it. To me btc is not just money but the hope to create a more honest fair society.
I do my part to legitimazie this movement by providing a staple service other than coffeep pizza n overstock. Everybody needs to do their part from the silicon valley VC to the small business merchants. Were not all Chinese speculators. Some of us are in this for the long haul.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:17:17
Because they only see it as a currency. As a currency btc isnt that life altering. Esp when they implement regulation at the exchanges. I think they will try to make it illegal to sell btc locally. They don't understand its a network that can be built upon. The real power lies in btc2.0.
