yeah wtf?? It literally lost 50% in the past couple weeks and now we're bragging on 17% of half of what it used to cost??
I don't know if people realize it needs to gain 100% to wipe away a 50% correction...

**EVERY** market consists of buying and selling and nothing more.. the same technical rules apply to bitcoin. accumulation, mark up, distribution, mark down. A market cannot stay parabolic forever..
Now when the market corrects I am not talking % from zero.. I am talking the % correction from where the last swing low point was created. There's a chance we could never see $10K ever again but I am not ruling it out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:46:24
And why is that. We hit $5k and corrected to $3k. Close to 50% retracements occur all the time in every single market. Do some homework. Of course we have no idea where it’s going to create a swing point but what makes you so definite that a major correction won’t happen. 
I’m already in under $10K so don’t assume I’m just sitting on my hands waiting for the correction. I’m looking to add to my position but up here isn’t where I’m looking. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:09
It will only stabilize once it is closer to hitting the coin limit in my opinion. Right now the last coin won't be mined until 2141 or something like that. It's possible to see growth until then as coins become more and more scarce/harder to get a hold of.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:21:59
I have been studying technical analysis for 8 years now and honestly you learn something new every day. Markets change constantly but lately my predictions of where price is going is at a much higher rate than when I first started. 
Pivot levels, market structure, and swing points can drastically change your view on the market. In no way is technical analysis easy to learn. It’s all about how you apply the tools. It’s not as simple as signal lines crossing overbought oversold. So there is definitely a misconception of TA not working in bitcoin.  They are just not applying it correctly. And in a parabolic market trend lines don’t work as well as horizontal support resistance. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:34
Don’t believe in patterns. Believe in price levels. If you take a buy when price hits a major psych level for example $100 and there’s actual support there.. the chart patterns will show up after the fact. But you certainly don’t need patterns to find good levels to trade at. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:14:29
Don’t forget that markets can consolidate for long periods of time.  We could create a range between 10k-20k for all of 2018 and jump to 100k in 2019.

Regardless of what it could be worth it wouldn’t hurt to diversify a bit if he were to only invest 1% of his retirement unless that 1% is jeopardizing his retirement. Obviously it’s a decision only an individual can make as you are taking a risk on something that isn’t yet quite clear of it’s use cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:17
I do see tons of volume traded today. I’m holding long term and don’t like jumping in/out of markets often so I added to my eth position. As long as $10K doesn’t break I also think we will accumulate until we’re ready for another crack at $20K. It will be tough emotionally if we don’t see price linger here for some time because that just means this market is recovering faster than ever and you need to be fast to pull the trigger on a buy. Unfortunately a lot of newer investors are FOMO’ing into the market so it just accelerates price movements on the way up and the way down. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:18:57
Does coinbase allow you to do limit orders?? I usually buy in fib % corrections at market. In the forex market I only use limits.

Understanding the markets and how they operate requires thousands of hours of study. Both technical, fundamental, and psychological. I have been in markets for close to a decade now and I still learn something new every day. 
Consistency is key. Learn just a few technical tools and master them. Have a method of doing research on the asset class you are interested in. Plan your entry and exit. Do this method every time you take a position and you will learn what your weaknesses and mistakes are much faster. If you’re constantly trying new methods etc you never learn what works and what doesn’t. 
Keep a journal of your progress and review it often. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:11:24
It is a very valid argument. Amateur traders shouldn’t be trading anything less than the daily chart as the moves occur much faster. Since price is fractal, the longer timeframe levels take longer to hit and you are able to learn at a much more comfortable rate when it comes to watching price reactions and market structure.

Why would you ever allow someone you don't know to access your screen? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:43:16
Because every market is buying and selling and nothing more . The underlying fundamentals are just different. Technical tools can be applied in every market because they are based on the same principles. It is only used as a timing tool.. not to strictly base a trade off of. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:48
Study some Fibonacci. 50% retracements happen all the time.
If you measure from the $10,000 mark up to $19,000 it has already retraced 50%.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:44:00
It is definitely something interesting to think about since dollars have been the baseline of US markets. I still think though that psychological levels play a big role as it stands. Analysts are targeting levels based on the USD... not on percentage of bitcoins. Maybe some day though. 
ie. when we hit $20k per bitcoin people are going to change how they think. Same thing happened when we hit $10k. 
I have to assume that everyone is still gauging bitcoin compared to US dollars with the exception of some die hard bitcoin supporters. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:14:34
Yes I only use it as a timing tool in crypto. I am in for the long term but I still want to reduce drawdown and maximize profit. If you get in at the right price it could mean a difference of 10-20% long term. 
I use TA also for intraday forex trades where my risk % is fixed at 2% per trade.

Very very good advice. Taking a position in a market should be based on an entire story. The fundamentals behind it, as well as the technicals. If you have a strong basis for a trade you are less likely to be shaken out.

Honestly the way this growth is occurring any sells they try to make will just be bought by the global market. I’ll take whatever they’re selling haha. They will just be transferring wealth to us in the long run.

It’s reasonable to take some of your position off the table at milestone prices. But why sell the whole position if you really believe the technology behind an asset. If you really believed that the internet was going to change the world why completely remove yourself from the market. I plan to always have some skin in crypto. A friend of mines boss holds shares of Apple just as part of his portfolio and refuses to sell even in downturns. It has earned him far more than trying to time the market.

50% of Americans don’t even have $1000 saved up. Very scary as most companies continue to shove consumption down our throats. They line their pockets while we empty ours.

I also think that the time we live in more people are informed at a much quicker rate.  Which could mean money pouring in on the dip much faster than when the dotcom bubble burst.

Man.. there are just so many different sources of material it’s extremely hard to list them because it can really send you down the rabbit hole. I learned everything I know from JAMES16 on Forex factory. He has been MIA for the longest time though so some of his material may be hard to find. 
I highly recommend Japanese candlestick patterns by steve nison, market wizards and trading in the zone by mark Douglas for market psychology. Also you can look into pivot point zones, market structure, wave analysis etc on YouTube. There are so many tools out there but I suggest only learning a few. 
Fibonacci retracements are a major tool I use and they’re quite easy to understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:41:27
You need to think like a wolf in any market. Just think of it this way.. when you see -20% on the day you are now buying btc at 20% off. 
If you walk into a department store and see an item for 20% off and one that’s marked up an extra 20% from retail price... which one are you going to buy?

I agree that the bubble may never fully pop. I do not like the term bubble in general. If you have done any reading on fibonacci retracement it is normal to see 50% - 62% corrections in any healthy trend. There is a certain point where people are just not willing to buy an asset at a certain price. Discount that same price 50% - 62% and now we're talking. Demand comes back into the market at these discounted prices and we create a new floor.
I have only been researching crypto for a few weeks but coming from the forex market this is a revolutionary step in the way we see and use money.
It really gets my juices flowing at the possibilities and how it can be implemented in the future. We supporters are not investing in the coin, we are investing in the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:20:32
I see a lot of talk on this sub about price corrections and a lot of it is being misunderstood with how markets actually work.
It seems that people being vocal about the impossibility of a 50% correction have not been around markets for very long. These corrections are measured from previous swing lows.. not from the beginning of time ($0). When you measure a 50% price correction it is measured from where the mark up phase starts! This level represents where the market has decided where the floor is (which isn't $0)
The example I have posted shows a price correction of 78% before the uptrend continues. The swing low is measured at $5000 (psychological level) and the swing high is measured at $8000 (psychological level). This represents a gain of $3,000. Guess how much of that move was corrected before continuing the uptrend? $2,250 or 75%!
 Let’s assume you buy 1 bitcoin at $3,000 and now you get out at $750 (representing the loss of $2,250) YOU HAVE JUST LOST 75% OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
So before you guys say that it is doubtful that price reaches $10K or lower, it is ENTIRELY possible and within the realm of possibility in any marketplace. 
I just wanted to provide a PSA to those who do not believe this market can go down... and to please invest responsibly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:43:33
Unless he's got enough fiat saved up that he could risk putting 1-2% of his fund into it. It would certainly help diversify his portfolio. If he's got $1M saved up risking $10K on a single bitcoin could provide him with a doubled retirement amount.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:09:03
Great post with some valid points. I do think that the adoption rate may not be overnight but the tech is here to stay so diversifying in multiple cryptos is much safer than placing one bet on a single coin.
I think though that it will be adopted at a much faster rate than most of us suspect. Think of all of the security flaws that have been appearing in the last few years. Target, Equifax, etc. These large corporations will be looking to protect their data and blockchain is the perfect solution.

5k is just a 50% retracement. Buy more =)
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:18:04
That is a valid point. Though the thought that his retirement fund will be obsolete he still needs to hedge it in some way. Be it more investments out of his weekly pay etc.

Markets aren’t exact.... you can’t predict 100% what’s going to happen at major psych levels. What we did was broke resistance and retested and held as support..  there was too much demand. It’s better to have a plan on where to add to your position than just buying on blind hope.

When we hit 20K I expect a huge correction back down to around 10-11K.
Anyone who has studied Fibonacci retracement knows that 50% swing corrections are extremely common.

Hey I don’t want to tell you what to do as I’m only 27 and just starting my professional career but financially it doesn’t make sense to take out a loan on bitcoin which isn’t guaranteed to provide you a return. What if the market goes sideways for a long period and you are constantly collecting interest on your loan?  Also, you’d have to pay an early withdrawal tax if you were to just take it out of your 401k. It would be wiser and more reasonable to dollar cost average and just invest weekly what you can afford. 5-10% of your paycheck every week so you are building a position at different price points. 
Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
It may be possible to use your 401k to purchase bitcoin but that’s something you’ll have to look into.

If people want to take trading/investing seriously they need to learn about correlating assets and intermarket money flows.
I'm sure you've already done this but study the last calendar year on the dollar index vs. bitcoin price. No coincidence.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:48:56
Go on tradingview and plot a vertical line on a BTC/USD chart on January 1st 2017. Then do the same on the dollar index (ticker DXY). Compare the two. 
Dollar sold off massively all of last year. In comparison, bitcoin had one of the most historic rallies ever. 
If government bond yields are not attracting investors they park their money in other asset classes. Ie. Crypto/equities/commodities (precious metals) 
If the dollar continues to sell off the money should keep flowing to these other asset classes because the interest rates are not beating current inflation rates. 
You can use the dollar index as a benchmark for other asset classes. Many traders use the Dow as a benchmark for equities. Etc.
