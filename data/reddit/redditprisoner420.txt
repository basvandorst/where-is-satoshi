I believe so, which is what makes people's skepticism about the market for a miner mounted on a Raspberry Pi even stranger... I'm not sure what exactly they're planning here, but people's outright dismissal of this device because of its current price tag is a bit disappointing.

TLDR: There's 20B of random data in a Bitcoin address (since the second round of hashing uses RIPEMD-160). Then 1B for the network info and 4B for the checksum. The frequency distribution of the second character is just an encoding quirk.

VCs take their money to the casinos themselves. They expect most startups to fail. If the price doesn't rise soon, Bitpay won't be the only company going out of business...

It's a devkit. I'd imagine the actual consumer version is going to cost a helluva lot less.

The same could be said for sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but religions still deemed them sinful. Logic can't be applied to religion.

Yeah, it always pisses me off when I hear people parrot that bullshit line. Maybe it makes sense in an urban country with actual public transit, but in most of America, you either have a car, or you're doomed to poverty.

This devkit probably won't sell many units, but if the consumer version costs a fraction of this device, it probably will sell.

Yeah, fuck Gavin for successfully ending the 5-year-long block size stalemate. At the very least, there seems to be consensus that 2-4-8 is acceptable. What has Blockstream done for the block size problem *in the short term*, apart from stonewalling? Don't you dare say "Lightning," that's not a short-term solution.
Bitcoin isn't just code. It faces economic and political problems as well. You can't just dismiss people's efforts to fix the non-technical problems Bitcoin faces as "making blog posts"...

Shrem didn't lose customer funds. He just broke AML laws. I'd imagine Karpeles is going to get a lot more time than Shrem.

I was disappointed that the developers of [REDACTED] weren't signatories. Any core devs care to chime in as to whether they were invited, and whether they're welcome to join the developers of Bitcoin Core? I'd mention the devs in question as well, but there's probably an AutoModerator filter banning any post containing their usernames, if they're not banned outright from posting here.

Oh really? How  have you contributed to Bitcoin development lately?
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:35:18
I dislike BC.I as much as the next guy, but why would you have to go to the clearnet? You have your private keys. You can sign a tx yourself and broadcast it with bitcoind over Tor.

Tell me more about how easy it is to manufacture a microchip at scale that does all of the above. The Bitcoin computer now is pretty useless. We're all in agreement. It's a different story when you start talking about embedded systems, though...
@_date: 2015-09-09 00:23:20
I would think that 
```var mykey = foo();```
```//do stuff```
mykey   = 0;
would do it in a sane world, but then again, I may be giving browser vendors too much credit. God, I hate JavaScript...
Also, the key is modified in-place in the HTML. When you click the generate new address button, it does everything without a page load. In theory, it could be done with the same memory location, but you could be right. I don't know enough about how browsers handle memory.

Most geeks know how to follow basic infosec practices, so they just use MSE on Windows.

If you're Qualcomm or Cisco, you could order these at scale for a fraction of the cost five years from now and put them in your IoT devices. It's a standardized, mass-producible chip. Presumably the final product would have a similar API to this product, so you could have apps ready to go if you have insider knowledge. Consumers aren't the market for this. IMO, this is like a less-polished Oculus DK1.

There's 2^160 addresses, so ~10^49. There are 10^50 atoms on earth. It's not impossible, but the probability is approximately zero.

I'm shuddering at the thought of how much worse  the MtGox collapse would have been if Gavin hadn't done that... Imagine if people weren't just prevented by MtGox from withdrawing their funds, but by network congestion, too. Throw in a "stress test" by an unscrupulous, shady exchange, and Bitcorn might have been right after all.
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:39:08
Your comment went over my head for a moment. I thought you were alluding to some insider info you supposedly had. I think the proper name for those changes is [REDACTED].

A colored coin needs to be at least as large as the dust limit, otherwise it can never be transferred. Tx fees are also going up, so your colored coin would have to be large enough to pay for the fee, or you'd need a centralized third party to pay the fee for you. At this time, a colored coin would need to be much larger than one satoshi. 1000 satoshis seems like a reasonable floor to me to account for the possibility that the dust limit may increase in the near future.

My point is, comparing someone who violated draconian anti-privacy laws to someone who robbed customers blind is bullshit. The only comparison is that they were both involved in unlawful activities involving Bitcoin and that's about it.

Maybe there's a use case here for businesses to distribute content more cheaply, but if you think anyone's going to pay to pirate content, you have rocks in your head. The whole point is to get shit for free...

No, but how about the people dumping on the functioning exchanges? How about the people buying Goxcoins on BitcoinBuilder? There were other sources of congestion besides just the lucky few who managed to cash out of EmptyGox.

Even if OP could track down everything in memory, it's probably not there. When you press the generate new address button, it should set the memory location where your private key is stored to null, and as others said, it pads the seed pool data with at least a timestamp. If it uses random data from Window.crypto and other browser sources besides your keystrokes, as I imagine it does, there's essentially no hope. I haven't personally reviewed the Javascript, so I could be wrong and bitaddress.org might just be incompetent, but I  doubt it. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 00:19:12
Agreed. I'm no fan of the revolving door in America, but it's not like it's a Bitcoin-specific problem. As a community, we should try to separate our distaste of crony capitalism and our desire for powerful allies. Basically, don't hate the players, hate the game.
