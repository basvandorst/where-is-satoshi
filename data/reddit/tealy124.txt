As a fellow Australian who has been looking at the same question, I was under the impression that it was subject to CGT on the profit made once sold. They were double-taxing it up until recently somehow through GST. I know they've fixed that issue, but I'd also like more definite answers on bitcoin and taxation and need to find a competent accountant who knows how to deal with bitcoins.
I read that CGT is 15% or 30% depending on if a business or an individual. Something like that. I wish I had better answers for you! 
If you find a good bitcoin-knowledgeable accountant, please let me know :)

I have a KeepKey and it's fantastic. The build quality looks alot better than many of the others also.
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:02:50
Ahhh I'm with you. Agreed! 
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:41:23
I highly recommend KeepKey as the hardware wallet for the security of your coins. Everyone keeps going on about Trezor but the KeepKey is equally if not a better product from build quality to its operation. Each to their own though and I have nothing against Trezor solutions but KeepKey has been largely understated in bitcoin subreddits.
The most important thing as many others have said already, make sure you backup those 12 words offline when creating your wallet to prevent someone recreating your wallet and thieving.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:16:47
Fantastic! Welcome to Bitcoin! HODL on tight! :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:42:29
They have videos on their page and YouTube account detailing simple procedures in answer to your questions.
Trezor &amp; Ledger are other hardware wallets with similar functionality but I can only speak of my great experience with my KeepKey.

I wouldn't mind also donating to charities with bitcoin, where available. Here in Australia each donation to an approved charity over $2 is tax deductible. My concern was whether it could still be claimed as a tax deduction. I suppose I could gain the proof via transaction history? Not sure it'd be that easy for tax purposes.  Maybe a donation via withdrawal from a KYC exchange with their tx history of yours?
It seems a fantastic idea though for charities to implement a btc donation system. I haven't done enough research to see if many or any do over here.
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:02:34
KeepKey for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:31:12
I've done a similar thing. Always buying, but more at the dips. I have a KeepKey hardware wallet (in a cold storage capacity) for security, and have convinced at least 75% of my family and a significant amount of friends and randoms to invest in bitcoin, especially for 'the journey,' not just for quick money. I suppose we all could talk for hours, often persuasively, about our passions. In this case, Bitcoin for me. Presumably also for alot of others in this subreddit.
I've never been a chaser of wealth and status, but Bitcoin has me by the *short-and-curlies*. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:48:45
Have you even used one? There has been little to no impact on the use and security of KeepKey as a result of KeepKey acquiring Multibit. If anything it incorporates further into additional wallets while maintaining its excellent security. Good luck hacking/obtaining the private keys from the KeepKey in the environment of non-OS, bare-metal with scrambler/randomiser. 
I respectfully disagree with your post in its entirety.
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:41:06
I never stated otherwise, merely indicating that speculating on future prices can be an important factor in the decision making process for some. At the very least it's a peripheral consideration.
I mined plenty back in 2012 but now prefer to buy bitcoins directly due to smaller margins. I understand the math just fine, thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:56:21
As much as I want bitcoin to go to the moon, and still believe it will in its own time, I believe good continual growth would benefit merchants, investors (speculators), traders, and hodlers alike.
The reduced volatility is one of the biggest boosts to BTC IMO as we head towards greater widespread adoption. Obviously (SegWit or LN) and cumulative factors may aid growth but we generally want to instill overall confidence in the speed and continued cheap costs of transactions, and the ease of use of quality security solutions (exchanges/wallets). 
I expect, as most do to see spikes and drops on occasion, but holding steady growth is important. I'm ok with hodling and the occasional buy-low-sell-high trading during the 'bubbles.'
On the other hand, there could an explosive event causing swift adoption or with bitcoin applications/layer/tech/innovations that could see more hyped-up spikes. There are my thoughts anyway. Cheers

What do you mean? a 51% attack? It's so outrageously unlikely that I wouldn't even consider mentioning it.


Completely agreed. I've said it before in another thread, but the build quality seems fantastic with the KeepKey with my only criticism being that some people have had issues with the provided USB cable. It's better to use a compatible mobile phone cable anyway. You also don't *have* to integrate the KeepKey into Chrome via the Chrome extensions. You can just use a desktop wallet like Multibit HD or Electrum with the hardware wallet very easily, still allowing the randomised/scrambled pin display for pin entry. If the KeepKey dies or is stolen, you can get another and restore your wallet with the seed words you have stored securely elsewhere. ~ Or just use your seeds words to re-create the wallet without hardware wallet security protection.

Agreed, he's digging himself a deeper and deeper hole. I consider that this will taint his reputation enough to dampen the impacts of future attempts at misinformation campaigns and downright idiocy.
I believe it to be strengthening Bitcoin and the community in the long run, proving that it can weather well-funded attempts at disrupting it for personal gain and/or greater centralisation.

Agreed. The fun of mining back then with racks of raised GPUs was a wonderful (yet hot) experience, but only sought to satisfy my love of messing with new toys rather than provide the optimal money-making experience (or BTC hoarding experience). 
I was confident back then in BTC rising in value but took the fun route, rather than the logical route.

Unless you speculate on bitcoin's price rising further to recoup any "losses." But that is speculation and equals increased risk.

This is an issue because?? Observations and deductions are quite important if you didn't realise. Ver is a tool, albeit a rich tool with bitcoin and money. If he had neither, do you think anyone would listen to his trash? Not a chance. Money buys influence but luckily he can't manipulate Bitcoin the way he wants it and buying some hashing power can only last so long. Bitcoin will out-live his influence IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:30:14

'Roger' that. 
He will be his own undoing. He's like a child having tantrums. It's unfortunate that people give this child the time of day and actually listen to his emotional drivel. I suppose though that given the misinformation that bold manoeuvres like the PSA on bitcoin.com spouts, the influence on new bitcoiners especially needs to be addressed IMO to limit the impact of FUD-spreading and bias.

Btcmarket.net under their news tab. You can google the others.
As for the rest of what I said, common sense (which is not common at all) or a cursory understanding of psychology will show that those with particular opinions will often inadvertently or consciously seek out those who validate their opinions/ideas. This often results in a means for the unhealthy justification of those opinions/ideas. 
This occurs on both sides of the fence for arguments surrounding the best way forward for Bitcoin and for petty, irrelevant issues.
Psychology is my area of expertise and I hope that people on both sides can detach the emotion, the poisonous rhetoric, and selfish agendas to truly promote helpful changes for the benefit of Bitcoin's future. Too often the arguments are emotionally or politically driven, with the facts getting painfully distorted, with pride limiting people's ability to be teachable. That's my 2c.

Roger is seeking to prey on the uneducated. He can't provide a useful argument that isn't solely based on ideologies or some dogmatic, recycled nonsense. 
The majority of the community who can see his tactics for what they are see the cringe-worthiness of such biased politically-motivated journalistic endeavours.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:28:37
As an Australian curious about the opinions of our local bitcoin exchanges and salesfolk, I can say that the major exchange here and most of the smaller places to buy bitcoin reject Bitcoin Unlimited and are pro-SegWit. 
IMO these referenced 'meetups' would likely be an intentional gathering of like-minded individuals. If holding anti-Core stances there's no surprises that the 'majority' of those at the meets come to such conclusions!
The spin is becoming so bleedingly obvious that anyone with a lick of intelligence can see it for what it is.

The odds are negligible. Segwit is backwards compatible itself and future useful hardforks are extremely likely to be both Segwit and Legacy address compatible.

No significant Bitcoin news here in Australia that I've heard - there's been a promise to remove the double GST (Goods &amp; Services Tax) taxation. It was first promised by our federal Treasurer last year and it has been talked about again in recent times. I haven't heard any news whether any actual action has been taken as yet, and my brother-in-law, a fellow Bitcoiner, works in the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) and has been watching the situation closely. It certainly doesn't appear to be at the forefront of any political discussions that I've heard, except for some positive pro-Bitcoin media releases in recent times.
