Ya that's a valid point.
Just I don't care too much what the USD/BTC rate is as much as the JPY/BTC.  So I wouldn't agree that the "USD is the base for Bitcoin" but would rather say it's the base for exchanges that operate in USD/BTC.  The USD may be a strong currency but if JPY or the Euro was greatly affected by war or something else the USD and US economy would be affected, so it's not like the USD is the sole reference for value in the world, like gold once was.
In Japan the price of imported commodities is affected by the strength of the dollar of course but at least somewhere like Japan where many electronics are made domestically, the cost of things I buy doesn't fluctuate much based on the USD/JPY exchange rate for most purchases.  The USA also doesn't export many of the raw materials needed for those electronics so the price of things is maybe more affected by China or other markets when it comes to domestic products.  
fyi: I'm by no means an economist, so correct me if I'm wrong
GPUs sadly are expensive here though.

by the way I wasn't saying I get my pension when i retire, which would be normal.  I get my pension if i *leave* the country today.  Essentially a pension refund of what I've paid over 5 years in full at the age of 28.  It's just an example of rights I have in Japan.  When you tried to say non-citizens don't have rights.  
Yeah I can't vote....but once again that's normal for non-citizens anywhere.

No because it isn't hard. Just spreading ignorance all around.  
I know of naturalized Japanese citizens (without marriage), from USA, Australia, Europe, Africa, or another Asian country.
And with marriage it's probably even easier to become Japanese.
I'm married to a Japanese national but I'd rather not take the citizenship since I'd have to give up my two other citizenships.

I was referencing your statements about "failed diversity" earlier in the conversation, after which you brought up Japan as some sort of "success anti-diversity".  However your defense of Japanese citizenship paths was to state essentially American citizenship paths.
So is this process amazing in Japan...or is it failed diversity in America?  You can't have both.


....wha?  I know those people exist, but it's not nearly what you are thinking it to be.


There is a loophole that lets some people have dual citizenship... so that's not exactly true.


This statement mixed with "slave two masters" nonsense reminds me of my evangelical dad.  So basically now I know you must be some religious zealot or at least raised by one.


You just  avoided my statement completely. In Japan I am not a citizen and I get state owned pension back (not private), I don't believe that is the same for these "failed diverse nations" you are hating on.  So saying I have no rights in Japan doesn't make sense practically.  Having to give up my other citizenship is not a lack of rights either.  My rights in Japan are just like anywhere else as a permanent resident.  Stop spreading lies about Japan.

@_date: 2018-09-24 11:48:46


You hinted earlier that "diversity" has failed elsewhere.  You  realize these are the criteria to become an American citizen right?...you know one of those "failed diverse nations".  You have to speak english, live there for many years under a green card (unable to leave the country for a period of time),  learn American history, and I believe prove you can support yourself...also marrying a citizen really helps.  This is the same as Japan more or less.
As for benefits you don't know shit.  If I left Japan today, I'd get the past 5 years of money I put into social security while not being a citizen.  If those aren't rights and benefits I don't know what are.  I don't think the US or UK will do  that for people paying into national pension funds while on a green card.


Your kids will be Japanese if your partner is.  It's only places like America that allow you to be a citizen by just being born there.  That has nothing to do with restricted immigration laws though...and has nothing to do with diversity.  It's just a random law.
As said, you need to just admit you got nothing.

I think the only thing the right wing people of UK have in their defense of "not being racist", at least from what I've seen on the news, is that they are bigoted against Polish immigrants as well.

And I think the whole idea of citizenship is a remnant of humanity's brutality we should've left behind.
Ideally citizenship is unnecessary and only feeds into the type of thinking you are expressing.  You could boil down your tribe mentality down to your apartment complex if you wanted to, it's all just a matter of what group you want to belong to.  City sports rivalries being the funniest of them all.


You may think you sound wise, but you don't. You aren't a slave, and citizenship is not a master.

I modified this code to search for different patterns, beyond what's in the code on github, just to see what would happen. Lot of hits that bots have already found from cracked password lists, common passwords, and common words from the dictionary.
I didn't know about brain wallets until recently and didn't realize my ledger 24 passphrase was essentially a brain wallet.  So just learning about the tech while doing something exciting lol.
Don't know what I'd do if I found an account untouched with BTC waiting to be found.... :P  (edit: joke for those who can't read emoji)
The most interesting one I found was the hash of the private key (hex) of the empty string "" brain wallet.  Inception!
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:36:47
Thank you for answering the questions as posed :)
If you don't mind I want to add some further questioning.
1) The house behind the front door is clearly belonging to the person who built the house/purchased the house.  In the realm of bitcoin isn't it more like I built my house, but when I open the door it leads to a fully furnished house far far away maybe another dimension.  Like if my actions in the physical world affected someone in another dimension should I care? When we start making real world (non-virtual) comparisons the analogy starts to diverge in my mind.
2) Interesting observation about squatting.  But that would give the assumption the person who had the property taken, owned the property and then didn't visit for a long time (this to me is actually scenario 1).  My scenario 2 is that I built a house, let someone bring their tv and couch inside while I hid in the bushes waiting.  Right when the tv/couch appeared I shipped it off to my other house. (While singing 'Thanks for the free gift crazy person').  I don't even give them an inkling of time to squat, and take the stuff they dropped off in nanoseconds.  
3) Interesting take, too bad you can't track individual bitcoin right?  But yea, we could base it on value in value out.
Also in this case the package has my addresses on it, no information about the "intended recipient", since in most cases the bitcoin being sent is just sent to an address with no meta data about who it's for.
4) I guess "best claim" is arguable and that's partially my point.  If we go by first come first serve then the bot is the owner.
5) That's a solid standpoint, that happens to differ from mine. Which is separating "best case response for karma/greater good" to "ethically right".  Thanks for responding :)

ah I see, I get what you mean


~~I think you changed my questioning to suite your moral framework.  Whether taking something that is not *mine* is right.~~  edit: Sorry, I did write "why is the BTC not mine" and I didn't mean to lol
My question is better phrased.


I'm not trying to arguing for claiming ownership. I'm wondering the moral argument for assuming ownership, and therefore linking this to "stealing"
I don't see private key generation as (edit: *sole* ownership), you are just taking a gamble with statistics, and a poor gamble if you create the key with a phrase that could be guessed.
A wild analogy being that everyone has the ability to create a wallet in their basement using *magical leather*.  When they finish the wallet it may or may not have bills appear in it.  If you happen to make the right wallet with the right pattern and colors of leather and your wallet has bills appear, why is that money anyones?  We don't have magical wallets but that's kinda what this is to me.
I don't actually want to ask why is the money *mine* because I see it as *anyones* or *no ones*.  Know what I mean?
edit: It's hard for me to phrase the whole questioning without using words like *my wallet*, for sake of conveying the thought.  But my stance currently is that it isn't anyones. So why is it not mine or theirs, or whatever, I'm trying to get to the same point lol.  Sorry for being convoluted.

@_date: 2018-08-26 09:37:48


I'm asking why would you assume they aren't :P
I'm not trying to avoid an ethical conundrum.  I don't have ethical qualms with either scenario 1 or 2, because of how I view private key generation.  I do not view it as a physical wallet that can be "found on the ground", so I don't consider it stealing, from a philosophical stand point.  The moment you put your money on the public ledger it's public in my opinion.  Whoever holds the private key, even if its by brain wallet bots, or by someone 10^48 years from now calculating your hash, whoever makes the private key holds the funds to me.
I'm just trying to feel the pulse/have a discussion with those who would actually find it to be a conundrum as you stated yourself :).
I have secure wallets that I use for my personal BTC, I like to think I'm not stupid :-D 
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:11:58
I'm not sure you get how brain wallets work ← as in the lack of limitations in brain wallets
They don't have to be 24 words, they don't have to be random, and they don't have to come out of bip-0039
People put money into and subsequently lost said money from
"chocolate", " ", "password", "gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha", "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", and many others including hashes of other public addresses!
I get that it's unlikely you'd guess a true 24 random seed, that's why I use them myself. And I get in your case that you'd be unlikely  to even guess noun-verb-noun.  But you are still assuming it's random and not culture based, which are many of the brain wallets that have been found.  Names of art work, names of books, common phrases, memes, etc.
What I mean is someone guessing something like "gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha", where the word spacing doesn't even match the same words when I googled the phrase. Or a story of someone picking a line from a random poem in Afrikaans!  Which was really interesting to me.  That's what I mean by  "obscure".  I don't mean guessing a real random 24 word seed, which could happen but is unlikely :)
And nothing about your post talks about ethics...so I'm gonna guess you just wanted to throw numbers at me, or you're a bot :)
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:03:37

But you cannot prove that you owned it before me, unless you can prove that you also own the address that sent the coins to the poor brain wallet as well.  If I also have the private key I can prove I own it equally as anyone else.  That's one reason I don't see this is an "ID in the wallet" proof. With a wave of my wand I can pull my ID out of it too, especially if I had my ID in the wallet years before anyone put money in it　→ brain bots


I'm also along the school of thought that to an extent copyright laws are BS.  Blatant plagiarism is well, just that, and I agree it's wrong.  But given the "root" musical components sometimes the arguments of what is "copied" or not is far fetched to me. Given the amount of music that is similar to others, it seems easy to come up with something sounding like another derivative without knowing or realizing.  So if someone uses a short seed and I also get access via the same short seed using the root bip-0039 components, it's like the copyright-large-net-law in a way...maybe a stretch. Just in the domain of, well you're outa luck.  (since theres a guy running around here attacking my character, what I would do practically is probably not take the coins, but it's fun to discuss this and fun to write code to learn about this).
I recently downloaded the vanity generator to try to make some cool addresses.

Not everything falls in line with your way of viewing the world.
You also missed the thought experiment scenario I set up by a mile.  Read other people's responses, everyone else is rational and calm...but.... you


I haven't actually stolen in my life, even a candy bar....so I don't know what you're on about.
You can have a philosophical belief that doesn't affect your actions based on other external factors.  
I may not think this specific case is stealing, but that doesn't mean I believe it isn't the best case resolution to find the owner.  Just for the fact that I know the other person may consider it stealing, will make me much less likely to act on my beliefs.
It's along the lines of → It's only cheating if your spouse considers it cheating.  Which has nothing to do with whether I consider it cheating or immoral.  My spouses feelings alone will guide my real world actions.
So should I stop having hypothetical conversations about what constitutes cheating with my mates just because my spouse has their own views? No.  Does this mean I will cheat against my spouses standard? No.
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:48:23
Thanks for the reply!
People always say it's like if someone left their wallet sitting out, but they never say its like if they left $100 sitting out.  Can you tell me why you chose that wording over the latter?  Calling it a wallet adds a sense of ownership since someone bought that wallet.
No one bought the private key they calculated it.  No one bought the $100 bill they earned it.  So for private keys which are neither bought nor earned, I have a hard time attaching any sort of ownership to a bitcoin address, no matter how angry I might be if the money was taken.  edit: I know you can argue the BTC was earned, but that's why I'm comparing it to finding an earned $100 bill void of the wallet, rather than $100 in a wallet :) 
I feel like at the point at which you've calculated a brain wallet based on some obscure phrase, there is no guarantee someone else hasn't done it as well (besides the "owner"), so any attempt at finding the true owner could be futile right?
Note: I live in Japan so people would actually turn in $100 sitting on the ground to the nearest police box, but I don't think that's the case in most countries and most people wouldn't blink twice about pocketing cash bills with no one around.  Would you find that scenario more palpable than if you found a physical wallet?
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:22:19
I still go back to seeing it as accessing something that *no one* owns.  
Like finding gold in the ground.  How the gold got there is not my business.  
I guess you could argue that it's like the gold is in the shape of a ring that clearly belonged to someone at some point in time, and you could take it to a museum/police to be sure.  I don't think I would call the person who keeps the gold ethically wrong, though.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:52:23
I did that too. I just added them in bulk to my dictionary list as single lines into the input text :P.
Why do it manually when you can run a script!
"correct horse battery staple"
"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy  dog"
Are two famous ones that have been found.  I can just add those sentences into my txt file and treat them the same as the single dictionary words I had.
I also ran the script on the bip-0039 to generate random 24 word phrases, just like many wallet generators do.  Just as unlikely as guessing a private key directly though lol.
The good side effect is that I now have hundreds of thousands of wallets to chose from!
@_date: 2018-08-26 11:06:06
As an aside can I ask a counter question.
If I got access to an address already in use, by randomly generating a private key, completely raw.  No seed, just created a random string of characters.
Would you call that "guessing someone's password"?
At what point is the address I generate mine, in your view?  Is it only mine because I know I "earned" the BTC that was added, which is not something you can verify once you publish it for donations.

No he made a rational, calm argument based on a belief I hold as well.  That when it comes to practical actions I would not necessarily follow my philosophical beliefs, because I have gut feelings and understand society around me holds different beliefs.  The fact that I'm even making the OP is that I understand people around me hold different views.
And the fact I'm using my normal, and may I say only, account shows that I'm not going around stealing shit by society's standard.
You also need to realize there is a difference between "stealing is ok", and "I have a different definition of stealing than you".  I am saying the latter.  *And if for some strange reason the law sided with my way of viewing BTC, then a brain wallet bot would in fact not be stealing by society's standard*
You just got emotional and your point was "You're a scumbag because if you got the chance you'd steal fuck you"

@_date: 2018-08-26 14:34:13
Why are you calling me a scumbag? lol  The fact that I'm not using a throw away account like *ehem* you, kinda makes me less sketchy in asking a hypothetical for sake of discussion than you are for insulting me.
If I generate the same private key from my own selection of words, why is it theirs and not mine or anyone else's is my question.


You created an argument I'm not trying to defend, and then called me a scumbag for it.  I'm in fact proposing you defend the need to make this analogy to someone's unlocked front door, which is a presupposition I don't agree with. I'd like to hear reasoning.
If they send money to an address whose private key I generated 3 years ago, why isn't it the case that they are opening *my* unlocked house and dropping money on *my* couch? 
It's a philosophical and ethical question so you don't have to be rude about it.  No one is talking about if I actually find BTC and whether I'm going to take it or not.
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:46:26
huh?  No, it means at the deepest level of life I don't know what I'd do because I can't assume I know what I'd do if that impossible occurrence happened.  And at the most shallow level it's fun to be facetious about criminal activity that I'll never have the chance to commit. Thanks for not quoting the emoji with the comment.
If i was really going to steal it, would I use my real account and post a question about it. I wouldn't expect a "redditor for 4 weeks" to understand that though.
I went looking because it was a fun experiment that involves programming.  There's such a thing as white hat, and such a thing as making a stupid joke.  That being said I'm not a hacker white/black hat, but I'm also not a criminal.

@_date: 2018-08-26 09:05:46


Can you elaborate on this?  There is no motive built into the system, so in your opinion what's the 'ethical' harm in assuming someone is sending money to you as a gift or for any other reason than a true mistake?  
I'm also interested in hearing why its ethically wrong to you.  Saying it is 'clear' does not explain any sort of thought process about what makes it ethically wrong.  I kinda want a discussion, since my post is clear that i know people think its wrong.
I care more about the 'why' than the 'what' tbh.  I'm not trying to take a poll of how many people think its ethically wrong :) 
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:48:38
I don't see it as the same because I did not "generate" the account.  I logged into someone else's account, that the *bank* generated and connected to an individual (legally binding).  The bank also has terms of use and privacy policies that probably cover these sorts of things.  Things we agree to by logging in.
The bank does not provide a way to generate that persons account. I would have to use their information to access an already generated account.  I guess the act of "generation" is what I see as "ownership" if I wanted to go there and define ownership in my mind :P.  So that's why I call it *anyones* or *no ones* account, not limited to *mine* or *theirs*.  
I mean that's kinda one of the problems with banks right?  "The money doesn't belong to you", "If we all tried to withdraw our money the bank couldn't provide it all".  The money is the banks at the end of the day, right?  They generated the account, they own the money, especially when they lose the amount above FDIC insurance. The one who generated has the power to block withdrawal. 
The blockchain in my understanding is the process of generating a *public account* that you have the ability to control, in a decentralized manner so they aren't fully analogous to banks and logins.  Everyone is the *bank* and anyone who "generates" the account can use the account, arguably has the right to use the account.
In other words the seed isn't a password, it's just a tool to generate a public account.
edit: I know I'm splitting hairs, but it's not like I have thought this out for years.  Just a newly thought out process, that I've been pondering about.

I have a way of looking at the world and how that applies to bitcoin, what I would practically do based on gut feelings is not take the money and try to find the owner.  I still find the discussion interesting, based on my objective viewpoint on it.  I also still make jokes about whether I'd take it or not, but I'd probably try to find the owner.
I don't agree it's the same as finding a wallet, for reasons explained elsewhere, which was part of my question.

Yeah one would be dumb to use such a wallet, but if they did and you had a database watching that address and you took the money out, are you stealing?  That's the simple version of the ethical question :)
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:05:39
That final statement sounds pretty far reaching to me. I think a lot of things we do that affect other people are arguably not our ethical responsibilities or liabilities. 
(edit: removed my example to avoid further divergence from the topic)
In a way I guess I feel that putting your money at a BTC address is an act of dis-ownership, it's no longer yours but it belongs to the system. If all the nodes shut down the money would cease to exist *in a way*. How is that ownership.  We've submitted to the will of the system. 
Just like putting it in a bank is handing over ownership to the bank, and the bank is not liable for anything beyond what they agreed to return, fdic insured.  
(edit addition: The blockchain is not liable or responsible to provide you with the ability to trade or use any of your BTC.  Performing a transaction in a smaller community of nodes could void your transaction down the line when more nodes join back up and decide your transactions aren't the consensus.  That doesn't sound like personal ownership. It sounds like collective ownership given to the blockchain as a sort of meta-entity, and we just have access to pieces of that ownership at various points in time.)
If someone hacked my computer to get the private key that would be stealing. If they entered my house to get it stealing. But if they created their own private key by themself, I don't consider that theft. 
I believe only I have the keys to use it, until someone else does as well. I know other people feel differently so what I'd do pratcticially is another story, that is **not take the money**.
Along those lines the dimension thing is maybe a bad example because it's still someone's house that I would see as stealing.  But what then becomes of my house that I built with my own hands, that house is no longer mine because it opens to another dimension?... It's a weird example I know.
But then again we don't call killing animals murder or taking a birds tree stealing. So we'd have to agree on the status of people from another dimension first. :) ��

Are we calling BTC sentient now? :P
I'm not sure how to approach this analogy...
If they had the technology to generate an exact copy of me, a clone.  I would allow them to claim the clone as theirs.  Or if their technology allowed them to control my body and my thoughts, that is my transactional outputs, I would have no choice but to submit, right?

Sorry if this has been asked before.
I keep seeing questions about person A sending to person B after a split, but it seems the assumption is that the person owned the wallet before the split.
If I create a new BTC paper wallet 2 months from now and someone sends BCC to that wallet, will my private key work as the BCC paper wallet at the same address?
Or does the split mean even the same public address could have different private keys down the line? Which would also mean an address on BCC could be a black hole on BTC?

Honestly wondering but doesn't this apply to any currency.
The purchasing power of 1 BTC 2 years ago is not the same as the purchasing power of 1 BTC today. (you know 10,000 for pizza vs 10,000 for a 100 lambos now)
If BTC replaced the USD and other fiat and we valued BTC against goods, that does not mean that X BTC for a loaf of bread in 2025 will be the same amount of BTC in 2150.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:15:56
Does this not have legal implications?
Is it correct to make the analogy that you essentially turned the gun on the robber and made them empty their wallets making you a robber.

I see.  This is assuming it isn't over deflated then, as the discussion above about deflation spiral.
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:41:53
Let's say bitcoin takes over and replaces fiat. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will not also go 'down' in its purchasing power, relative to let's say ETH if ETH takes over sometime after that.
And if the argument is the fixed supply of bitcoin, and therefore no inflation*, then I'd say that not all crypto has a fixed value.
So with that in mind, how is this still a criticism of USD when the same could happen to bitcoin and other crypto in terms of their own purchasing power?
*: I'm not sure if fixed supply implies no inflation but that's what I've gathered from other memes and posts I've seen.
edit: Also if I'm not mistaken massive deflation is just as bad as massive inflation.....right?
edit: Just found and am reading this:  (searching to counter my concerns not bolster them)
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:10:59
I understand the concept of inflation and how a fixed supply aims to right the wrongs of the system.
But I feel like you can just replace the things in this meme to suit your needs.
"Place trust in paper" with "Place trust in electricity/internet"
"Cash is as valuable...believe"  with "BTC is as valuable...believe"
"Purchasing power USD" with "Purchasing power BTC"
The difference you state covers why the USD graph shows inflation due to indefinite expansion of the money supply.
The purchasing power of BTC could decrease in the future for scarcity of affordable electricity for mining transactions, loss of interest, or adoption of a different virtual currency.
So thats why my question is how is this different to any other currency?  Yes the cause may be different but BTC isn't immune to anything this meme shows afaik.
I know I'm over analyzing it....it's just a meme who cares... etc.
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:11:30
Japan has a very similar way of calculating taxes as the US, I  believe with some slight differences.  Either way... yeah any in game currency that isn't strictly in-game, that is it can be traded for real money someway or another, is taxable by these laws.  If it's a one-player game or you cannot  exchange any of your money, like Borderlands/Fallout(?), then it wouldn't apply.
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:51:20
Thanks for the detailed reply! 
When I said "how is Bitcoin different" I didn't mean nothing has changed or that it isn't an improvement. I just meant it doesn't seem to not have what the meme shows.  We must still trust in something at least partially arbitrarily. 
I say "partially arbitrary" to avoid "everyone is sharing some collective but incorrect delusion is nonsense".  I do not believe it is a collective delusion.  I believe it is a collective agreement on what value is, at which point it is not a delusion because everyone has agreed upon it and is willing to stake real assets against it, in reciprocation.  But it's  still arbitrary.
We must still rely on a resource that we do not control and is centrally controlled, that is electricity.  All we need is across the board mining tax or laws like China did and it could all go down the drain (could not would).  
The markets will determine purchasing power. Which by your explanation I now get is what "SHOULD" happen and that maybe the memes graph could be titled "inflation " rather than purchasing power, again I'm being too picky at this point I know.
It seems a part of your explanation includes a belief system that bitcoin will take 100% market share and that bitcoin cannot be controlled like Fiat.
Why don't you leave room for the possibility that bitcoin could fail to adopt and another virtual currency take it's place?  Or even that world governments could enact laws that make it really risky to handle bitcoin. 
And you said no one can conspire to alter bitcoin...yet I see so many people accuse bitcoin hard forks for being manipulated and controlled by entities. If that's true why cant Bitcoin fall into the same traps.  All the developers could leave and  go to XYZ coin.  There could be a disruptive hard fork that hurts the possibility of mass adoption, etc, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:51:20
Ill go with. Because they control and dictate how the ebb and flow  goes and can allocate the newly created money to the things they see fit, like increased defence budgets. (Probably a bad example).  The rich who lobby in America can maintain their status and the rest of us suffer in both deflation and inflation extremes. 
I don't know enough about the flaws of eth yet. I didn't mean to be pushing eth in my original statement. Just thought it was the next contender in popularity. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:54:51
One thing I don't understand is why everything here cannot just be swapped around... for instance


I wasn't saying BTC is bad due to deflation I meant to say that even if it is inflation resistant (my understanding) that it is not deflation resistant, and isn't that a whole new problem?  One that does not make it any different from fiat [edit: in  that regard].  In this case it is not immune to the negative effects of changing buying power.  
Hence I don't fully understand the criticism posed by this meme other than that its a criticism of currency in general so... why is it on this forum as an attack on fiat specifically...?
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:53:55

Very interesting in that they need not be moved! 
I know about cowry shells as currency since the  Ghanaian (my heritage) Cedi is name after the shells.  


It sounds like you agree with my statement of arbitrary though. The best available ledger is not the absolute best ledger, if there was such a thing.  That society could've easily used trees instead of stones and achieved the same results. 
You are arguing that the existence of currency is not arbitrary, I agree.  What I am calling arbitrary is what particular currency is settled upon. Which is why I can't really definitively say btc will 100% reign supreme as you can.  I feel that something similar and differing only slightly could take over.  It seems like you are willing to brush it aside due to your belief that the likelihood of currently existing alt coins being able to do so, which is a reasonable position to have.
Maybe there is a better word than arbitrary for what I feel.  Since its more like there are so many complex factors that it might as well be arbitrary.  No one person can control whether btc is 100% adopted or whether some stroke of luck makes bch [edit: insert any other altcoin that will not cause knee jerk reaction] take over, due to the majority of people not currently involved favoring bch over btc when they get involved.
I'll read  up on those links you sent  :) thanks


I'm not sure why this sounds so ominous, but I will try!

[edit: You said fiat propaganda, assumed I don't understand fractional reserve banking for some reason, and called me a noob who knows fuck all.  So I'm just gonna say.  I'm not using an alt account like you, you can find my real identity in two seconds.  I hodl, I mine, I support cyrptocurrency, and I am not a troll spouting propaganda.  Just voicing my thoughts.]
I understand how fiat currencies work in the way you've described.  That's not really  related to the question I'm posing though.
I agree bitcoin solves many of the problems with the current system, it just doesn't seem that purchasing power graphs and "fiat is only worth what you believe in it" is relevant as that applies to all currencies.  Gold, sea shells, fiat, or cryptocurrency are all only worth what you are willing to believe in them, and can only purchase a particular thing at a particular point in time, and that changes.
This particular post just seems like a self deprecating meme, if that's the point then cool, its a jab at all currency.  I just didn't think that was the point.
It also takes a jab at paper, which is a cheap laugh.  When bitcoin relies essentially on us to keep being able to produce electricity and have the internet.  These are not guaranteed and paper or gold is at least a little more guaranteed than electricity/internet, imho.  For example, WW3 or running out of oil before sustainable means catch up, which would mean all the poorer nations bitcoin is supposed to liberate may not have access to the internet in the future if the cost of electricity is unsustainable.  
Sorry if there's some gap of ignorance on my part, I continually look into these things, and I'm genuinely asking these questions.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:57:20

I'm pretty sure that unless you started with 0 coins and ended with 0 coins this form of calculation is not correct.  You are taxed on every trade event including altcoin to altcoin, by FIFO (for America I  believe), but your calculation is some sort of average basis.
In Japan we can do rolling average calculation which still is different from what you mentioned, but CT only does FIFO/LIFO so  just did that and called it a day.

A lot of companies are participating here though.  Bitcoin cash-back (not bitcoin cash the currency) for major online retailers, no banks rejecting exchanges, Coincheck was an electricity provider (until their hack), regular electronics stores accepting bitcoin, etc.
The adoption here seems pretty wide spread.
My friend's mom is even participating as a form of diversification a little bit and she's in her 60s.  She got into it from her own research, before it got hyped, and has no technical background.  So it's reaching normal people, who aren't just trading/get rich quick, more than you might think.

Japan has pretty explicit outlines on crypto tax and the tax office even helped me walk through the questions I had.
So my filing was smooth, including expensing mining equipment and writing off CoinTracking software as a business expense (bought it when the unlimited cost me $5k worth of btc, very good for my tax in 2018-2022 since its a 4 year depreciating* software expense)

@_date: 2018-04-05 06:45:02
Cannot give advice as to whether its worth it... especially for America.
I was going to file all as a business but was told by the tax official that in Japan, since its a self reporting system, its up to the tax payer to determine their "desire" in pursuing as a business.  This is because I file as a sole-prioprietor so I can pick and choose what is for my business (which is freelance --&gt; engineer, and athletics --&gt; motorcycle racing).  I did not start a corporation for bitcoin trading lol.  That would be a whole other headache and would not fall into the same "desire" based pursuit, iirc.
For 2018 I filed the gains and expenses as 雑収入 aka Misc. Income, so not a business income/expense.  I did that because I didn't earn enough for it to look like I was pursuing it as a main job and the tax rate is better for misc income, which was the suggestion of the tax official.
The reason I did CT as a business expense is because I took it as software needed to help calculate my "blue sheet" business taxes now and in the future.  Whether I end up filing crypto gains as business in the future is another thing, but my intention in buying it was to do so.

I think the IRS wants you to report holdings though, so I guess unless they sell all positions they would still have to give up the fact they are trading crypto.

Ah yes I meant "entire portfolio traded at fmv" the simplified case being start with 0 and end with 0.  Just said it because if you didn't trade the whole portfolio the way you calculated doesn't handle the proper FIFO that is required for America.
But if you did what you said its probably close, just don't know if an auditor would care.
As long as you're consistent it should even out across the many years right?
