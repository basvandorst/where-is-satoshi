The regs are bad but this one rule isn't. It isn't so much that it's turned over to the state but the requirement for them to keep it. Currently there is nothing preventing any exchange from saying you have been inactive and just take your money whenever they want.

Coinbase has a system set up where you can send, receive, and purchase bitcoins through SMS text. Also, people that don't have the technology to accept bitcoins probably don't want cash either, they probably rather just barter items then get cash for stuff.

Well, the beauty of bitcoin is that anybody can be the lead developer. And if github went down I'm sure another similar site would pop up soon enough for everybody to use.

Nope, github just acts as a place we're everybody can easily read and download the source code. All you would have to do is get a majority of people too download and compile your code for a fork to happen. You don't need github for this.

Isn't that what reddit is for?

Everybody is missing the point where when you set up 2fa they specifically tell you to write your key down and keep it in a safe place.

Oh look another bitcoin article that shows there purpose being for illegal activities. I mean it's not like ALL drug dealers use dollars or anything.

Also looks like they used two lines in the video. Not sure if this splits the weight between the two, or if the other is just a backup.
