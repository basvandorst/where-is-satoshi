wow this will make bitcoin feel like a different coin,  but in a positive way
thanks for explaining so well!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:54:54
BS, looking at past charts doesnt mean anything for future charts, especially for something so volatile as crypto
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:25:11
what are one of the biggest bugs LN has right now?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:43:45
When do we have to open new channel? Is it for example if i wanna send my bitcoin from trezor to coinbase, do i have to pay to open channel only first time when Im sending to coinbase and then the other transactions just use that channel so its free? Is it like that for every transaction? or is it different.. i dont get it
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:04:46
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:26
people are saying it will  take long time for it to be ready

Bitcoin needs to fix its high fee issues
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:10
get out of my face weakling
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:46
Can someone ELI5 why are dips healthy?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:08:31
It's when you want to kill yourself.. thats how it feels
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:43
I dont really care about the dip, I care about these outrageous fees:
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:45
why should be rhetorical question here considering I answered you already in OP.. fees are abnormally high.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:53
lol no thanks
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:09:40
I dont think bitcoin can compete with such high fees.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:34
it went up from 16k to almost 20k in less than a 30 minutes.. this gif is so accurate
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:04
I dont really care about dips, im used to it.. im holding btc since 2013.. im just worried about high fees..
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:02:17
Bitcoin needs to fix its high fee issues
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:24:11
60$? Are you on legacy? Mine is 24$
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:03:01
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:30:05
They have this for a reason:
@_date: 2016-03-24 01:02:59
I dont think its that serious, I just need to wait for blockchain staff to remove 2FA so I can re-enable on new number.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:57:03
I have no idea xD
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:37:46
I get anxious every time this happens, i have 6 btc but in the end it doesnt even matter
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:33:47
Yes buy but not yet, I think it will drop little bit more
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:17:35
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:21:53
You think this is the lowest btc will drop?
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:54:43
I have a bad feel about this one :c
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:27:43
this is exactly how i see myself in the future 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:15:44
my dad also had this issue
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:41:40
Yes its good decision for long run, trust me
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:28:05
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:53:25
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:17:04

Yeah apparently..
"Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x."
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:47:43
i was right.. my smelling sense never fails
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:13:14
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:42:13
The thing that fee is huge? He has valid point
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:29:34
I dont get it..
Why do I need to move my BTC if i want to exchange BCH
Isnt there just any website where i can deposit my bch and just exchange it with simple button click..
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:16:37
I'll get 3 Antminers S9, electricity here is 0.08$ so it will be affordable to run them
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:57:11
Guys I smell 10k
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:12:55
Yet unconfirmed transactions keep going up ridicously and btc dropped below 6000, why :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:49:45
looks like they are down or not exchanging for bch anymore :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:37:53
Thanks for the answer, I already claimed hardforked bch from my btc address on trezor now I just want to sell bch for btc
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:11:12

@_date: 2017-11-12 14:10:14
How greedy can they be to do all this with all those money they have.. If i was at their place I would just retire with life and enjoy it
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:46:27

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:38:22
We need to make lower fees though
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:04:35
What do you mean? To start mining?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:59:40
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:16:04
What do you mean, resell bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:49:54
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:18:10
damn right
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:04:24
If I had more bitcoin/money I'd launch a campaing myself informing people more about crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:06:19
Yeah I'm considering 3x s9 miners for a start then casually upgrade
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:19:42
Oh, good idea but I wanna mine, not interested in reselling
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:59:12
People ask questions on internet about stuff they dont know and then they get they questions answered and then the people in the future can come and google that  question and read the answers the very same person asked the first time like this guy did. If by your logic everyone should google their question then google would be pointless for searching questions as every post / question they find would be "google it".. enough of this blaspamy 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:01:48
Shut the hell up lmao
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:44:44
Dude it raised over 200$ in less than half an hour..
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:25:25
what the hell is happening with btc now 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:51:26
Not $200, $100, but dont worry.. if you know what i mean
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:09:51
Over 5300 now :P
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:23:53
oh yes babyyyyyyy
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:41:41
I hope you are right.. I'll be rich asf if it goes like it did 4 years ago
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:19:45
I dont really use btc for trading / investing.. I use bitcoin for taking payments and buying stuff so idk.. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:39:23
Interesting, by looking at it it looks like bitcoin will keep going higher and higher
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:15:46
I actually did but it never went so high (almost 100$ in past 2 days)
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:34:24
I started using btc in mid 2015 bro :P
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:58:31
Should I sell it? I have 8 btc in my wallet D:
