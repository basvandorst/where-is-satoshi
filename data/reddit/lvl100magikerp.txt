Thank god you're saying this. You probably saved so many people from falling into this trap.

I jumped in just before the bch pump and dump which made my initial worth drop 20% or so. Just held and now it's almost trippled my worth.
There is no best time, nobody knows, trust your gut, or don't. Don't invest more than you can lose and you'll enjoy the ride

If I were to send the money to my family from e.g GDAX and then receive "gifts" from them, would this be really stupid?
Someone at work said this worked sending 1000€~ to each family member. Seems like a stupidly easy way to get phone calls from the skatteverk?

I had to call them to allow sending money to a foreign country. Also had to say what amount I was sending and why and if I hade any politicians in my family or friends.
They let me send though.

Yeah, i've written twice but i've heard no positive things about their support. I guess waiting is my only option

When sending the Transaction there is no "reference number" slot, only a "message"
I guessed that was the one since coinbase says it can have different names for differenr banks.
Not sure where else to put the reference code
