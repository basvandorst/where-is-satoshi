Somebody that dumb probably has a life savings in the 3 digits tbf.

I didn't say attribute. I said peg. As in you're referring to the fool as me or presumably the fictitious professor.


I don't get it. Maybe that's cause I'm stupid. idk

Nah, I don't have to. I just noticed this post on the front page and decided to throw my hat into the comments.
food for thought, getting angry at people telling you that your 'investment' is a bubble is one of the [4 signs of a bubble](


@_date: 2017-12-13 16:17:06


Well obviously you're not going to see dissent from people who actively speculate in the bubble... They're **part of the bubble**

Oh, well then I guess theres no other problems with cryptocurrency. 
That was the only one.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:27:43
Just like a Bitcoin speculator to jump straight to gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:51:45
I bet he knows way more than you about speculation and bubbles.

Your quote is valid. Who you are pegging it to is incorrect.
Also, you don't console money, you consolidate it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:31:15


Well, no. You're 'blessed' because someone else is paying for it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:19:34


I didn't say I was upset that someone else was paying for it. You read meaning into my comment that wasn't there because you're absolutely insistent on making every conversation you have adversarial, you lead pipe.
I corrected the notion that "if you have tax paid health care, you will be blessed to because you paid a monthly, less impacting quantity of money." 
You're not blessed because you're paying monthly, you're 'blessed' because you're not paying the full price.
It's disingenuous to say that "you will be blessed to because you paid a monthly, less impacting quantity of money." because it implies that the healthcare itself became more affordable. The healthcare didn't become more affordable, it's just that someone else is paying for it.
you could say the same thing about insurance. The fact that I'm paying a less impactful monthly price for my health insurance does not make healthcare cheaper at point of consumption, it just means I'm not paying the full price.

I know.
What's your point? again, I never stated any position on private vs public.
You're not addressing anything that I'm saying. I feel like you're reading off of a script.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:13:13
I never actually stated any position on private vs public.
I just don't want incorrect information propagated.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:23:05
I don't understand your question. 
Are you asking me what was incorrect about the initial statement or are you asking me how private insurance is different?
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:56:15
This is called speculation.
