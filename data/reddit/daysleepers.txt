What does this mean for the futures? Some come good soon right? Surely the big traders won’t let this happen if they are all in for 18k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:42
Yeah, you’re right Traders never manipulate a market like that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:11
I genuinely don’t have a clue as to how futures work. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:45
Already there. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:07:42
It’s over!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:52:14
You know what though, if I could I would help this guy out for no reward. I’d never rob anyone. 
Is it possible to collect my medal in person though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:42:00
Yeah. Basically every day I look at my bitcoins and decide if I can afford to invest that much. Because that’s effectively what I am doing every time I don’t take it out.

I have the only thing that can read that. Just pop in the mail and I’ll send it right back.

My home town. And I’ve just bought a house. 
Not this one. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:16:56
Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:24:30
I’m treating it as a get less poor quick scheme. 
All your points are excellent and well made. I don’t have huge amounts of liquid cash so I put a bit in for an experiment. I’ll put more in soon, just need to believe and understand more. Having £ in makes it more important to learn. Plus, what the fuck else am I meant to do at work other than watch the tickers. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:38:04
Still there. 300 left to swallow. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:25:31
Yeah exactly. Need both just to make sure it all works for the guy.

End of the week.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:38
I’m in for a tiny amount. But it’s fast becoming not tiny.  $20k by the end of the week. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:35
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:55
:( I’m broke. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:46:45
At his point, all I’ve got is hope. And desperate need for a new F5 key. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:55
Man, remember, it’s still early!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:03:49
God dammit I hope you are right. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:28:48
I bought in on Sunday. £450ish. I’m loving the ride. This afternoon hasn’t been the best but just means the high will be even better. Welcome!
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:46:41
What are you going to do with it? 6US cents? Like 4.5p?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:42:53
How desperate are you for 6 cents?
