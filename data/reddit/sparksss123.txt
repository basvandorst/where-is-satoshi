forget Moore's law.
Look at yr smart phone 10 years ago.
check its price and spec.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:55:09
is there something like a block explorer where i can see the transaction verification.
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:39:21
can you decrease the transaction size without a hard fork?
how do u suggest reducing the volume? does that mean less ppl using it?
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:11:46
you have a 14 days account, GTFO
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:15:23
Opportunity Cost here is neglecting large number of ppl and devices to run full nodes
Having smaller block size will leads to small Blockchain size which will make it easier to ppl who only have access to very slow internet to run a full node even on their smart phones

isnt that what Core/Blockstream doing?
using social engineering and influence average joe to be angry all the time at anyone support BitcoinCash
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:38:15
what about [Opportunity Cost](
If there is room for a more decentralized Robust network, why not?
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:02:32
Any idea why these initiatives/Ideas are not implemented on $BTC? (Aside from  since it's still under development)
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:35:06
i didnt ask for your approval.
You obviously fail to understand the question, instead, you provided weak answer just to have an unproductive argument that leads no where but more confusion 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:33:42
All what u mentioned is the result of the decentralization.
Why not decrease the block size in order to have more distribute nodes?
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:53:11
My only concern is that so far, there is only ONE solution is provided for scaling which is LN and this solution didn't prove it can handle the capacity, at least not yet.
Being dependant on one and one olution alone is scary, isn't there any proposals or another testing solutions in addition to LN?

One of the main problems in first world countries is  CORRUPTION
Look at how many countries that have dead ppl voted in their elections, devaluate local currency, increasing interest rate, Censorship internet, the list goes on and on.
Its not taking power from government/banks, its distributing the power to the ppl.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:06:18
I disagree with yr statement, now, more government and financial organizations are aware of Bitcoin and understand how it works much more than u and me.
With all the analytics tools/software they are able to track every single transaction that's why all.the criminal u r talking about have already moved or moving from Bitcoin.
Shutting down Alphabay, Hansa, BTC-e are just few examples of government tracking, Thus for us is not a bad news, its bad news for online criminals.
Having said that, every single break through in technology have been done and embraced by undergrounds market first, they are the first one we used the normal internet that u and me use they are the first to use Bitcoin, increase cyber hack and security etc...
I am not saying we should follow them, but facts are fact, they led the whole thing even without even knowing that.
Many darkweb sites now started to move from Bitcoin to Monero, Zcash, etc... I don't really see bitcoin used as much in this area, I do see more privacy coins growing due to this reason
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:05:11
I did hear alot about closing account, can't really say they took money from anyone.
I think the main problem is there is no real competition here "Coinbase and Gemini", every other BTC exchange outside USA is getting hammered for having US customers.
I personally didn't have any problem with them so far and their support are okay with me, I have been using them for a while, between Gemini and Coinbase, Coinbase definitely better.
Is there any other real exchange I am not aware of that can actually compete with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:25:26
So,  " a chain of blocks" can only be used for Bitcoin or there are several applications can be done using the same methodology?
My point is, If there is more applications, how can I get to know about them. I have been reading about smart contracts and things like that and I am very interested about this methodology, where online I can get more technical details about that.
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:25:44
Is there Egyptians here trade or own BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:57:16
can anyone here response to these points, i can only see ppl say its FUD but i never saw any actual answer to these claims.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:50:18
I am using blockchain.info , is there a ay to increase my fees to make the transaction faster?
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:58:12
I have a wallet with 4 wallets online, only blockchain.info is slow if u choose the default fees, it always pass through, but it takes 4 to 6 days, this only started to appear in the last few weeks, it was seamless before

Just deleted Mycelium, that's one HUGE dumb move by Mycelium. Externally stupid...
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:51:09
May be that's what they are looking for!!!!
