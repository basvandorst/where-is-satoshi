As someone who's had a lagging interest in bitcoin &amp; blockchain, but also knows next-to-nothing about what "really" happened in regards to this whole scandal, is there a non-biased resource I could look at to read more into this whole thing?
I looked at your post history a bit, and am also interested if you've found anything interesting from your post asking about the average bitcoin price/volume back to 2011? Comparing it to the S&amp;P500, gold, etc is intriguing

Thanks for this. You seem more unbiased than the majority of posters here.

Pomp is just as delusional as Trump. The crypto community loses respect each time Pomp gets facetime with other communities.

Owning property that you plan to live in for a long time will *never* be a bad idea if you can assuredly afford it. As bullish as I am on cryptos, if I had that kind of bitcoin bag then I'd definitely sell some to buy a house.

They don't need a third party to exist but that doesn't mean current ruling institutions won't attempt to regulate those in their jurisdiction who use it. Current blockchain implementations aren't as anonymous or private as people think

Where are you getting that from?
From what I see, it's a natural extension of the laws that are already in place for asking whether or not people are transferring $10k worth of assets over international borders. It's not illegal to carry $10k worth of cash overseas but they will ask you about it.

until privacy improvements are made, current blockchain transactions aren't as anonymous or private as people think. it's not unreasonable for US gov to regulate within US borders

One of the guys in the meeting just said "We are getting killed by traditional means of money laundering.....digital currencies represent a small fraction of current money laundering techniques"
I don't think they care enough yet

On the subject of digital currencies being used for money laundering - 
"We are getting killed in the traditional ways o money laundering. Digital currencies represent a small fraction of current money laundering techniques."
This is good for bitcoiners...right? ?

well. I wouldn't say $4800, but the $4000's in general. the push from 4000-&gt;4800 could just be people looking for free money after the split. money left altcoins at the same time btc/usd has been shooting back up

Are there any apps on your phone that allow you to book prostitutes? Any that provide a platform to look up child pornography?
It's quite quite easy to circumvent tax laws with bitcoin because of it's anonymity. Once governments find it a big enough problem, I'm sure they will attempt take actions against it.  "Nothing in life is certain but death and taxes." 
And that's not even taking into account what would happen if it's found that terrorists (however you want to define that term) start using bitcoin to fund operations across the globe.  
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:56:07
but govs can outlaw the use of bitcoins for in-person purchases?? that would surely affect it's adoption...
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:54:28
mainly tax laws.
