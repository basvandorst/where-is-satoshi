What are your personal estimates for 2018? Half of the growth we've had? A third? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:59:52
Personally I'd be immensely, immensely happy with 50k. My problem is looking at the short term price and not longer term technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:05:40
So do you see adoption to the point of market cap competing with existing precious metals or commodities? In that case, if you are right about worldwide adoption a six digit bitcoin would easily be in the ballpark next few years, and we're still early adopters. My biggest worry is that Bitcoin is going to be a fad that people will ultimately stop using.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:01:49
I think that's going to depend on how scaling solutions go in 2018, which is why I'm banking on a pivotal year ahead. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:01:37
Question is whether or not we're in 1995-1996 or nearing 2000 level prices. Personally I'd like to believe 2018 is equivalent to 1996 and we still have a few good year for mass integration. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:27:03
By that estimation, how much do you think the price or market cap has left in the tank to run?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:29:31
The six digit Bitcoin price is a lot of people's moons; I think a lot of factors are going to have to come true for a 150-160k bitcoin if it does increase tenfold. It's hard imagining right now, probably just as buying in at 1000 people found it hard to see a 19-20k bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:12:22
Go to the wayback archive and look at posts on r/bitcoin and r/bitcoinmarkets from April and May this year. People were calling best case bull scenarios at 9-10k. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:00:00
Still reading up on Lightning, but how far away do people estimate implementation of LN and Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:41:58
For reasons like this part of me is filled with immense regret I didn't buy in at 2000 when I first researched it. A climb to anything 6 digit is going to be harder than a climb from 2-20k. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:24:14
Store of value is certainly the go to use for now. But if scaling solutions do distinguishably bump down fees and tx times, I would easily venture to say it would be viewed as store of value or currency. Or both. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:17:59
Yeah, once those actual people get into the market we might see an actual early majority and a huge wave of new adopters. But part of that relies on institutional investors. Futures have been dissapointing throughout, but what are the odds wall street actually takes their money to crypto for 2018...most people would bet at least there's greater interest from old money.
At least by that comparison...we're not at 2000 levels yet, and therefore we are early. I also have never heard of the social media bubble as much as the internet bubble, south sea bubble, real estate bubble, you know... but that's interesting...and also that social media like facebook haven't turned into the myspace of their time. 
Hahaha, you read the Nick Bostrom paper didn't you? We had a crazy debate about that in my Quantum class, but most professors here don't seem to take it seriously more than a thought experiment. Maybe it's attributable to the fact that human beings operate in psychological, macro patterns on a global scale. We're genetically hardwired to fall into greed cycles, internet 2.0's, 3.0's, 4.0's. There's always going to be bubbles as long as there's money and people with wallets holding it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:20:25
On that note, I'd like to believe large exchanges are going to adopt lightning in 2018. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:10:32
I think we might see a mixed bag, especially among emerging markets whose govt's are ambivalent or polarized over crypto. The China news that banned exchanges was pretty huge for the time, but Bitcoin proved resilient during one of its worst points in the year. I don't forsee North America opressing it outright more than slapping regulations, especially with the IRS and SEC. I also don't see the rest of Asia banning it outright more than taking increasing steps to establish ecomomic oversight if Bitcoin grows into a monetary powerhouse. 
I'd agree 6 digits sometime possibly by 2020. Anything in the 6 digit range would be insane by today's standards, and if Bitcoin really does pass and hold 6 digits I'd very well say it's here to stay at that point.
But then again, what the hell do I know. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:58:57
I think that Trump tweet may have pinpointed the bottom lol.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:26:07
The chosen one has spoken.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:19:00
My main concern is when exchanges like Coinbase imply that segwit or lightning aren't their top priorites, nor is speeding up transactions or reducing fees, that they're doing Bitcoin in general a huge slow down, and that by the time lightning does get to them there may have been a loss of momentum or exodus to alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:20:39
Where do you see adoption increasing to? 5%? 10%? 
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:04:19
I suspect near 9k support like last time.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:48:28
Lol same, except I got in a little later than you. I unfortunately hesitated at 5k.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:25:47
If we fix the fees and transfer times this year I'd definitely say 100k is in range, if not more. 
Can I ask why you chose Bitcoin over its competitors?
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:02:38
They were also eerily correct on the December 15 low.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:06:55
Still wasn't too far off. Many people in January still expected capitulations below the 3k level.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:00:17
Everybody who said they were waiting for a dip to buy when it was climbing last month, you better all follow through today.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:46:30
Why is 13000 so hard to get past. It’s almost just as hard as the 9000 mark. Psychological benchmarks everywhere.

@_date: 2019-07-17 04:57:24
Three if counting the December 15th bear market bottom.
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:59:38
"Be right back." -13k
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:47:01
Question is if there’s enough pressure left to get past sell walls we hit when the near 14k was rejected.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:57:52
Realistically my gut tells me we gradually near 20k again with corrections this year, reach 30-40k next year, then 60-80k in 2021 a year after the halvening.
My gut is sometimes full of shit though. Which reminds me I gotta go take a dump right now.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:01:40
Wouldn’t be surprised if he bought at 11.3 then put this out lol.

Very cool!
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:57:00
True, but I would shit myself so hard if the October prediction was fulfilled too.
Technically he got 3/3. He also called the December 15th bottom.

As always, don't invest more than you can afford to lose has always been the adage here, but I'm sorry you're going through all of that. If you wait patiently and for the long term, there's a chance you'll get that money back and maybe more. Everything is uncertain, but everyone invests in bitcoin for a reason, be it the tech or financial stability. Hang in there. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:59:28
Watch the trump tweet call the bottom lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:45:53
Time to see if bitcoin really is the comeback kid. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:56
A lot of people were asleep when this thing hit 13k. Asia was just awake a couple hours ago, and a huge chunk of this is coming off of selling from China, South Korea, Japan, hell, even Norh Korea maybe. The east coast went to bed a couple hours ago and hasn't seen the damage. Big whales are always going to be looking at their price movements of their fortunes, but smaller guys who hold bits and pieces of savings in this across a very wide board? They're going to wake up to an unpleasant surprise. Some are going to want more. Some are going to hold and have a bad day. Then quite a few who jumped into the latest miniature bubble are going to panic sell. We could see this thing drop to around 10k, matching a lot of year end price predictions...by tomorrow morning. Or maybe it'll maintain even when everyone wakes up to blood in the streets. 
I personally think it's entering oversold territory, and some smart money is going to pick it up at some critical support over Christmas and into New Years. I could be wrong. We'll see. I always like to think of Bitcoin as the Tom Brady of the finance world, the ultimate comeback kid. Never count it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:28
I'm relatively new to all this, but I'm assuming it's dipped much much worse before...and still recovered.

13k is the new 9k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:21
I don't think it's close to popping yet on a macro level. It's often called a bubble because the overwhelming majority can't see it. When everyone's saying it's a bubble and there's skepticism in the market most of the time these bubbles aren't close to popping. When CNBC and all these talk show hosts and pundits start saying it's not a bubble or it's the new normal, and mass adoption by institutional money becomes more common then I'd say we're in real danger.

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:01
It'll appear as if it's losing, then when everyone, including its own fans and supporters, have doubted it and concluded the game's over, it'll prove everyone wrong and comeback in the 4th quarter. 3-28 seems pretty familiar in a sports analogy now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:16
I'm in a few grand near that amount. I'm a student so I can afford to be a bit riskier, but this is the first time in my life I've come face to face with genuine financial fear. At least if I lose it it'll be a lesson on risk...a very expensive lesson to be taught.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:17
It BTC bleeds there's a high probability other cryptos will bleed, as they all did today. If you want a hedge in the cryptomarket and just want to diversify in there only, go into mainstream alts like Ethereum for long term hedging. An ideal hedge would be outside crypto, like a good growth stock. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:44:32
My biggest fear is east coast wakes up tomorrow morning and starts dumping after seeing the red. Hopefully Asia has themselves a nice discount buy in day and gets us up to 16 range. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:36:12
It means if you believe in the investment potential of this technology into the long run, you'll hold and realize profits down the line. You'll stand your ground financially. If this thing really does become mainstream and institutional money enters, maybe some years down the line the events that took place today will all be a bad memory, a blip on the bigger chart.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:19
Because nothing can go on parabolic forever. Anything that keeps doing 10-30% a day for weeks is bound to crash hard. A dip or correction is a healthy pullback because it "Resets technicals" from all time highs. Strength indexes and momentum indicators goes down from overbought levels, and people exit off the enormous growth. It's basically a break button for a supercar going too fast. The faster you go, the harder you crash. It's cool to go fast, but sometimes you need to break a little. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:22
What's the worse you've hodled through? I bought in too high, now all my friends are calling me stupid for losing money on a popped bubble, lol.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:02
I've been saying for some time now with each of these dips and "deaths" that Bitcoin is like the Brady of the financial world. Of course nobody can be certain of anything, but from what we've seen it certainly is a comeback kid.

Damn, dude :(. I missed my chance to buy in at the 12k dip since I was too chicken that it would drop more. Price found a stable support and growing volume, and then I bought in around 16k thinking uptrend was secure, then today happens...my luck is really bad :(. Everyone I knew was making money off this, so I knew I suffered from fear of missing out at first, but before I bought I read the technology and the white paper and some lectures, looked at analysis predictions, and determined it was worth the risk, put in a bit of my extra savings...I just so happened to catch it at 17k average. Everything went well for a week, then the red began. I swear if this thing enters a bull market the week that I buy in I will prove that I am just unlucky with money. I almost bought in at 8k all in, but i held off. Then I waited until another ATH to buy in, and now I regret just not going with my gut and doing 8k. Same thing happened with stocks. Before I came to crypto I was doing tech investments. I had a good week until the sell off came and never recovered since. Maybe I'm the one causing this thing to tank five days after I enter :(. Maybe some people really are just naturally unlucky. Sorry if I caused this, man. The minute I get out it starts rallying. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:36

They're climbing in yo wallets, snatching your bitcoin up. So you need to hold your coins, hide your keys, hold your coins, hide your keys.

Merry Christmas! Regardless of where Bitcoin goes, I have a house, a family who loves me, clean water and air, hot food in front of me, and my favorite movies and video games. This is a blessing in the world. Shit, I mean there's people at war right now who haven't had food in days, I can't be sitting here complaining about a little money, about whatever lambo I didn't get. I'm good man, I feel blessed already.

Bubbles have traditionally gotten bigger and bigger over the years. The Dot Com and Housing Bubbles all saw bigger and bigger successive market caps. I think what we may have been seeing is micro-bubbles popping on 1 month time scales, like the one right now. Then it finds a support and climbs to a new high. For the whole thing to come down I may want to wait for a higher market cap and price.

No, once you sell you may not be willing to go back in after having tasted defeat a first time. If you stay and this storm passes, then you'll have a better direction.

If anyone's actually depressed or suicidal, come to r/SuicideWatch. We love to listen and talk there. You'll be surprised how many people go there for support after losing financial security, making bad decisions on money, etc. you're not alone.

Yeah, I have a couple thousand off internships I did over the summer. I'm a student so I can afford to lose some and not be someone older throwing his 401k into this thing, so I'm fairly okay with losing a grand or two for now. Good luck, hope you find your moon.

Well, at least bcash is falling. If we're going down...he's coming down with us.

Bought in at 17k last time. I have some money left for purchase I'm willing to invest, might wait until momentum is restored upward and the blood stops.

If you look at the archive from a couple years ago people were panicking when it went from 1000 to the hundreds, and many were saying it was over, the project is dead. That was a couple years ago...imagine if you bought when it was seven hundred something.

I never said I needed to pay my bills? I don't really have any at this point. I'm afraid cause I don't want to lose money, lol.

So what does the scale predict for next year? Sorry, the image wasn't loading on my tablet.

Goddamn it. How are we ever going to get out of this range if this keeps happening. We've been stuck here since June. So long to the prophecy.

Up 100% people don't seem to care too much, down to 3-8% everyone panics and thinks it's all over. Lol, I learned to shake off emotional qualms on up and down fluctuations after January. Normal day.

Waiting on that last part to come true one day.

John Mcafee posted his number on his twitter earlier. Called him twenty minutes ago and didn't think I was gonna get a response.
But holy shit... actually picked up. He says there's no way he's wrong about bitcoin 1 million, so he's not prepared to eat his dick off cause he says he won't have to.
Interesting conversation to say the least. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:44:02
So freaking accurate.

Fuck, I knew it was too good to be true. Bull Trap :'(.

At this point I'm just hoping to break even.

Given your observations from inside the current banking world, do you personally forsee new, institutional money trickling into Bitcoin this year?

@_date: 2018-02-11 09:14:05
I'm personally looking at two of my own possibilities:
-This was a bear trap and we bounce back from this and hold 8k as support, head past 9k Sunday or Monday, maybe 10 next week. 
-This was a bull trap, and we bleed into 7k range, and maybe even 6k, then we hit the near term bottom again and try again to switch into an actual bull run. We delay a rally by a week(s) until we have a clear green volume charge.

I was looking through old photos on my phone and saw a screenshot of an article published in April. The title reads: 
"Bitcoin Price Abruptly Drops 4%, 12 Hours after Fresh 2019 High at $5,450"
And here we are at 9-10k just half a year later.
Really helps you zoom out if you ever want have a bigger picture of things.
