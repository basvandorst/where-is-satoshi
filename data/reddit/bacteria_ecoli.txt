While spending would be more beneficial than holding, people are always going to rather spend bad money (USD etc.) than good money (Btc) (Also known as Gresham's Law). I can imagine that in the world of DeFi crypto currently seems to be heading into, people locking their BTC in smart contracts and lending them out might result in fairly low fees for the borrowers, since so many people are just holding and would be willing to offer lend their funds. Furthermore, people often mention the "store of value" concept of btc and I think that btc won't be really used for payments between users in the future; it will rather be some sort of reserve currency or a currency only used for immensely large payments, both profiting from the safety of the indestructible powerhouse that the btc network is. In this scenario, holding wouldn't cause many problems. But, maybe, with the introduction of LN and other future concepts, btc might be able to lower its fees and increase its transaction speed, so that it would be used for payments as well, in which case people would be more incentivized to spend it (easier and lower fees) (plus it'd wipe out all altcoins trying to fill this feeless p2p transactions space like XLM, NANO or IOTA).   
I guess we have to wait and see what happens.


People will value fast and secure transactions without any intermediaries more and more and are therefore going to be ready to spend more in fees as halvings will keep on cutting the rewards for miners, you'll see. The only scenario where this wouldn't be true is if there was another project that would make btc useless/obsolete so that its current users would literally have no reason not to use it over btc.

Use Kraken and a bank transfer, you pay like 0.2%ish trade fee and a flat btc fee if you want to take it out of the exchange

This is all great and I agree, but the reason why btc is recession resistant is because its supply isn't alterable, especially by governments. Forgot to mention that ;)

I wouldn't really try to dig into it...sure, maybe there was some negative news in the last days, but I'm pretty sure this was just another random drop. Someone sells initially, then little more people, stop losses get procced and we are where we are. Given how thin the order books are, it really isn't all that hard. Don't try to justify the random drops and pumps.
