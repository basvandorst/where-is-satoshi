I looked on the IOS App Store and couldn’t find Gemini, is it a website? Do you mind sending a link, thanks in advance!

Hi! My Blue Wallet received the transaction. Does it make sense to store my bitcoin in Blue Wallet? Will the price increase if the rate of BTC increases?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:08:02
Thank you! I don’t understand the majority of what you said but I’ll do some research when I get the chance next .

No.. I copied the code from Blue Wallet and put it in the recipient address in Mycelium. I'm still a bit of a newbie at this and didn't know.

Hmm.. I thought Coinbase wasn't a wallet? Yet its on that list.. I went with Mycelium.. I sent my BTC (tho I still have some ETH and LTC in CB) to it and I'm not sure if it went through or not! 
edit: just checked my Mycelium wallet and it went through! Yay. Still need to research what this means, but I guess it means its safe for now.

Thank you, that’s definitely what I’m thinking as well. I have less than $1000
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:16:38
thanks for the write up, I really appreciate it!
Yes I will have to get back into my practice of keeping up with Bitcoin news. 
I have since moved my BTC into Mycelium, and it seems to have worked! I still have ETH and LTC in Coinbase, it's not a lot so I don't mind losing it tomorrow when the move happens.
I'm not exactly sure what my BTC in a wallet means, just that it's safe and I guess I won't lose any of it during tomorrow's event. But I would like to put it back into Coinbase to help it grow after tomorrow. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:16:50
Uh.. thanks? Haha what is this!
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:14:36
No, I misunderstood. The value in coin goes up even when they are in your wallet and I didn't know that!
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:24:24
Thanks! I did send over my BTC and it was received so I feel much better! Excited to see what happens tomorrow.

I have left my crypto in Coinbase, ever since purchasing it back in 2017. It is Bitcoin, but I also bought some Ethereal and Litecoin. It has all been there through the forks, and I don't think they provided me with forked coins.. however there are new types of coin on coinbase, is that what you are talking about?
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:21:02
Thank you! Yes that makes sense. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:26:46
I meant that as price grows up, so does my share amount.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:12:40
Thank you! I went with Mycelium since I heard it was good in another thread.. I sent my BTC to it earlier today and I'm hoping it went through but I'm not sure! The QR code thing is weird. I still have ETH and LTC in coinbase so I will move those once I know it works. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:12:07
Awesome thanks friend!!
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:16:59
I got Mycelium. Is that considered a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:36:23
That makes sense thanks for the info!

You sound nice, and last time I asked I was lambasted and basically called stupid. I used to keep up with Bitcoin, but I haven't the past 6 months. I have BTC in Coinbase and I guess I need to remove them and put them in a wallet. Can you tell me a good wallet to use for Iphone? Or, if I just sell all of my coin back to my bank account (that its been linked to) and re-buy after this is over, would that work?
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:11:47
Yea! I’m using Mycelium.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:33:39
You misunderstood- in order to buy on coinbase, you had to link a bank account. I don't have a wallet yet! So i want to move my BTC from coinbase to a wallet, NOT link a wallet to my personal bank account! 
I think I see the problem now, I didn't fully verify my account so I haven't been able to send or receive digital currency. Do you think it's safe to give them the last 4 of my social security and my address? That is what "Conbase" asks for to finish verifying your account.. idk it seems sketchy to me.

It was last year I think! I’ve just been letting it chill, and I honestly lost interest and stopped gathering information daily. And I’m a girl. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:03:08
thank you! 
Except the Coinbase account is linked to my bank account.. and there doesn't appear to be an option to add a mobile wallet account as a receiving option.. 
I'll keep looking and see if I can just paste the wallet QR code!

Since you seem knowledgeable, maybe you can help me, as I haven't been as engaged in Bitcoin in sometime.
I have money in Coinbase, and I want to put it into a wallet. The ones you mentioned I couldn't really find in Iphone Apps. I did find Mycelium, and I had that previously downloaded so I downloaded it again. Except now I can't figure out how to transfer funds.
It's either I do this, or I keep my coin in Coinbase and HODL and hope Jan 3 isn't as bad as people are saying! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:39:40
What wallet do you use? Should I move my bitcoin over from Coinbase before Jan 3rd if I don't want access to it taken away?
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:00:13
Thanks but I’m a woman :) do you mean I should just keep HODL and leave it in coinbase? Or should I take everything out before Jan 3rd?
