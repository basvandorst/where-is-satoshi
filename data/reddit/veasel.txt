I though your we're exaggerating about the website, but holy fuck, I was fully expecting to see an HTML 2.0 header when I opened the source.
It also look likes it was written with editor or vi.

So your to blame for all those fucking retarded questions I had to put up with in industries exams.
Thanks Man :P
Indecently, I've had the pleasure of meeting Vince Cerf.  
I'm easily within the top 10% of the SMRT population, but I've never felt so stupid talking to another human being in my entire life.

This is completely ass backwards. 
The whole architecture of the internet was designed to be neutral, and freely carry traffic.  
You have go out of your way to engineer in a lot of unwieldy infrastructure into an IPv4 network to even start to have visibility and control over types of traffic, and it's even harder now with most traffic being encrypted by default. 
Technically it's MUCH easier to build a fully open network, but that's not the best way to make money.

Okay, now my studies in philosophy date from when the first Clinton was still in office.  But that would be considered right Libertarianism.   
Anarchism can and is considered a part of the classical Libertarianism of Russell and co.
Libertarianism is just as fractured as any other idealist belief system, humans can't reach consensus on anything.

Because Nuclear is just about the most expensive way you can produce power, it has a massive capital outlay and ongoing operating costs, just dealing with the waste is prohibitively expensive. The only way Nuclear is making a comeback is if they crack fusion plants, or the cost of burning dinosaurs skyrockets.

I can't see it breaking 20k anytime in the next 6 months, the sell walls at that level look to be huge, looks like where most people want to cash out at 20, it'll take another big general public demand spike to crack the mid 19s.
Best case but highly unlikely, the dumb money driving up priced is taking a break for the holidays, and it's too the moon in January. 
Likely case, the dumb money has dried up because it was driven by euphoria, and unrealistic expectations of massive short term gains and now their actual fearful lizard brains have kicked in.  They will now hold, or cash out slowly, leaving prices stable at around 15000 as the new normal.  
Likely case, the dumb panics and dumps after xmas as they just put 20k on credit cards to buy into a bull run driven by other dumb money - and the whole thing comes crashing down to 5000 USD and then a slow six month bleed back down to 1000 USD.
I'm 50/50 on those last two, it's maybe even something in between.  If I has skin in the game I'd cash out my exposure take a healthy 20-30% profit while the market is still liquid and hold the rest.  
But I've got no vested interest in this, it's just an academic exercise.

It's the same in New Zealand, if you want a good general news source you listen to the public broadcaster Radio New Zealand.   Also the BBC world service has always been, and is still fantastic.

Yes, I'm a IT network engineer by trade, been doing it for 20 years, I know in intricate detail how data networks and the Internet in particular operate.  I'm no Vince Cerf (Who I've had the pleasure to meet at an early IPv6 conference - that man is crazy smart.) but you could consider me a subject mater expert.  
Any time the MSM talks about anything to do with "The Internet" it drives me batshit because it's almost always completely wrong.   
If you get your news from 24 hours news your probably as misinformed as they are. 
You can never going wrong looking for expert news sources for your info, just make sure you check credentials.

Honestly, I have been thinking about it on and off for years, even started to build a mining rig out of spare parts, I had lying around but procrastinated long for it not to be worth it - and I'm not bothered in the least about missing the boat, and in the end, for me personally I'll get more enjoyment out of it in other ways.

It's definitely fuelled by pure speculation and a bit of mania.  
But this uncharted territory, I don't think anyone can predict WTF will happen in 1 hours let alone 12 months down the line.  Maybe it can reach 1 million?  I sure as hell don't know. 
I'm going to staying the fuck away from it, it's one black swan from blowing up spectacularly - that may mean I miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime, but I'm already well and own a good chunk of land in possibly the most stable country in the world (New Zealand).  So the only thing I'd gain is fancy luxuries I don't even need. 
Respect to all those willing to ride the dragon though, it sure fun to watch.

The main point is the Philippines is they essential removed the controls on murder.  And we saw a whole bunch of more murdering, because a lot of people are dicks, and are restrained by policing.  
The internet hasn't changed the dynamics of human interactions, just the methods.  Large scale organisation still requires hierarchies of control if you want any sort of stability.  Otherwise you see factions and infighting, as people disagree on the best course of action, or just flat out serve there own interests. 
People would be served well by learning about the history behind market regulations, and why they came about in the first place, and not just in the US.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:12:11
Yes, because people are fearful, foolish and violent.  The Philippines essentially de-criminalised murder, and it was abused the gangs,  police and even normal citizens - want to kill your spouse, accuse them of being drug dealers, job tidy.
Also people tend respond to being murdered with more murdering (Vigilantes, Lynch mobs).  Look at the murder rates of any non policed society to a properly centrally policed one.
Libertarians and Anarchists never account for human nature in their idealism.  We're greedy, stupid and violent jerks - order usually has to be enforced somehow, be it a tribal chief, warlord, king, church or government - that why society will tend to willingly cede control to an authority even at the cost of personal freedom. 
Unregulated / Self regulated systems have only ever been shown to work on small scales were all individuals can communicate directly with each other.  After that tribalism and feudalism takes hold.  And that eventual shakes itself out in long sequence of power struggles, usually through force, ending in a regional hegemony, then social forces work to form governments of all various types.    
This shit repeats itself constantly thought history.

New Zealand had to HIGHY regulate it's Telco/ISP market before we got any reasonably competition, the whole market was largely captured by a single monopoly (Telecom NZ) abusing there market position.
Local lines unbundling (mandatory and enforced wholesale access to cable/copper and fibre) was the key, along with regulated access rates to competitors.  That only partially worked, we then forced the break up the incumbent Telecom into retails and lines/infrastructure companies.  
Our ISP market has never been healthier, with cheaper faster services all round. 
Blanket statements of regulation bad, less regulation fixes everything are pretty naive, and often ideologically driven.

Isn't that the true free market though? I'm pretty sure the traditional libertarian stance is insider trading is okay.

My brother in law says I should invest in bitcoin - his only other investment was buying into water powered car technology. 
I'm not even joking, I've heard a dozen other stories like this, and only within the last month.  It's a speculative bubble, and the pro's are now milking the last of the dollars out of the dumb money in day trading.
