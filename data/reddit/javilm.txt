Yes, based on the context I agree with you.

I know what RAID is. I'm an IT manager / sysadmin. That's why I say that your question makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:37:51
Not really. You can generate all possible addresses in a couple lines of code in your favorite programming language. 
The problem would be waiting for the program to finish, or even storing that huge list of addresses. :-)

Oh, wait. I was wrong. The screenshot says that 404.5 million BTC moved, when the current supply is 16 million.
Yes, looks like a bug.

The other candidates (regardless of their political views) had at least some sense of ethics and morals. Trump doesn't. He'll tell you whatever lie you want to hear to get your support, and you'll swallow it.


You're not even trying to sound serious.
We'll talk again after his impeachment/resignation later this year.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:18:47
Sure, if they expect to make profit in the short term. 
Personally I'm here for the long term and I don't care about these daily/weekly price changes. I just buy whenever I can afford it, and we'll see 3-4 years from now what the results are. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:47:39
Trump didn't win because he's smart. He won because he manipulated millions of even dumber people to vote for him. People like you.

At this pace it's going to go past 400,000 yen between today and tomorrow. That's a big psychological wall here in Japan.
If it does, expect it to be all over the news later this week.

I don't see any bug there. The data suggests that somebody sold $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in a Korean exchange.
Probably that's what made the price drop today.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:55:48
Really? What about this person makes you think he's smart? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:17:47
It's cute how some people think they can predict short-term price fluctuations just because they can draw some lines on a graph. :-)

Look at it this way: in 3 years, either one Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 or we'll see John McAfee eat his own dick on TV.

Not to be rude, but your question doesn't make any sense.

Unlikely, but it can happen. As an ex-Apple employee, I've learnt not to install betas in my day-to-day machines. :-)

It's eating all  your storage because it's syncing the whole blockchain. Not sure how long it is now, but last time I was still running a node it was well over 50GB, and that was a long time ago. 
Uninstall it with **brew uninstall bitcoind**. Not sure this will delete the data files, though.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:31:08
If you're not sure where this formula stores the blockchain, just download Omni DiskSweeper ( and go find the path that's using all your storage, then delete it.

No. Never input your seed anywhere. They’re trying to steal your private key.
The fact that they’re asking you to save the page locally to your computer and open it from there is intended to give you a false sense of security. Even when running locally the page most likely contains JavaScript code that will connect to their server to deliver your seed.

Yes, you're right. It hasn't happend. Or at least not yet.
What's your opinion on the Mueller investigation, and the current state of his mandate?
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:58:20
That would make sense, but I'm afraid I don't have the patience or self-control to wait until the 24th.
In any case, I'm buying long-term, so I don't care much about the daily/weekly/monthly spikes and dips. I just buy a little bit when I get my salary every month and forget about it for the next four weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:43:58
Probably because the 25th is payday in Japan and other countries in Asia. I buy a bit every 25th, and it's likely that others do the same.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:28:00
Personally I use Coincheck. No problem at all with them and the fees are reasonable. However, they support a limited set of cryptocurrencies. The ones I care about are all there, so I’m fine with it. 
I don’t have experience with the other two, so I can’t really tell you whether they’re good or not. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:34:59
What are you even talking about? Your comment makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:43:14
Pointless. People who look for patterns are going to find them, even if they don't exist. Same as religion.
There are many factors at work. Nothing to see here.

Sure! Power up your time machine and go to 2008. Once you arrive buy a fast computer and start mining Bitcoin. 
You're welcome.

Why do you still have data caps? This is 2017.

Residential. For business we have more options depending on the SLA and connection type (PPPoE or direct). I'm the IT manager for a small company here and we have several circuits. We pay about $900/month for a 2 Gbps direct line with a 16-IP subnet, about $150 for the same thing with only one public IP, and about $80/month for a 1 Gbps PPPoE connection with one IP. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:53:20
So true. Here in Japan there are lots of competing ISPs. That, together with the fact that the area to cover isn't as big as in the US, results in pretty interesting prices for broadband. I have an uncapped 2 Gbps fiber optics line at home for about $35/month. I pay a bit extra ($20/month) for a fixed IP address for my servers. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:50:30
What the fuck are you talking about? Are you so bent in not admitting your mistake that you're now trying to deflect by making up ridiculous shit?

THIS. 
The idiot made a prediction based on nothing. No rationale, no explanation, no supporting evidence. Just speculation. 
Then he gets touchy when others call him on his bullshit.

I just got off my time machine from my trip to the future. I can confirm this is not true. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:15:31
Also, a couple years ago they started offering 10 Gbps. Still expensive for residential, but very affordable for a business (around $1400/month). 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:51:15
After seeing his reply I have to change my opinion. Yes, he's most certainly a troll.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:44:43
It seems that we're having a big misunderstanding here. Let's see if I'm able to explain what's wrong with your argument.
First, your point: yes, 10% of $1 is 100x 10% of 1 penny, in the same way as 10% of 1 BTC is more than 10% of 1 ETH. No objection about this. But this is not the point.
Let's round things up and say that 1 BTC costs $2500 and 1 ETH costs $400, and you have $10000 to invest.
In this situation you don't choose between buying 100 BTC ($250000) or 100 ETH ($40000). Your choices are 4 BTC or 25 ETH. Let's try both:
    4 BTC x $2500 = $10000
    or
    25 ETH x $400 = $10000
Now let's say that the crypto market in general goes down by 10% and this affects both BTC and ETH in the same way. They both lose 10% value. Your new asset list would be:
    4 BTC x $2250 = $9000
    or
    25 ETH x $360 = $9000
Did I explain it well enough?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:45:30
Not necessarily. Maybe he's just looking at the math in the wrong way. This has happened to all of us one time or another.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:24:04
Looks like you're the one who doesn't understand math. Losing x% of $10 is no different from losing the same x% of 1000 pennies. 
In other words, which one is heavier? A kilo of lead or a kilo of feathers?
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:12:04
Hahaha my credit card statement disagrees. :-)
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:24:47
I wouldn't make fun of this guy. Think of how he must be feeling.
I'm in a similar situation: I learnt about Bitcoin 4-5 years ago and even tried mining on the Slush pool for a while, but I abandoned the effort at 0.00135142 BTC because I couldn't maintain it (that balance is still sitting there). Later I considered buying BTC, but living paycheck to paycheck with a mortgage, wife and child I couldn't justify it.
Now, every single day I **regret** not having invested a little money back then. My life would be completely different: we would have been able to pay off the mortgage and secure our son's education. Instead, here I am, still in the same job, still paying the mortgage, and still living paycheck to paycheck.
Don't make fun of the guy. If he really didn't buy then regret must be eating him from the inside.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:32:35
Exactly. Life goes on, and I haven't actually lost anything.
I won't deny that the regret is still there, but I think it's better to take this as a learning experience, because obsessing over the past isn't going to make things better in the present.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:57:05
Obvious scam is obvious.
