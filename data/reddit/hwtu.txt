Thanks, do you have an EUR or USD Xapo card?
And is there any BTC debit card with better BTC-fiat exchange rate?
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:43:28
Good luck. I sold my ETC for ETH, because all Dapps are staying on the ETH chain ;)

I'm not American.
You can only buy for Mexican Pesos there, I wanna buy with USD/EUR.
I wanna use wire transfer because it's a larger amount.

Thanks, both are in Panama (my favorite jurisdiction;)
But their BID-ASK spread ( is terrible: 430.98 - 437.50
EDIT: 1.5% - not THAT terrible...

In which country do they have bank account?
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:06:47
The gold is owned by the token holders and not by DigixGlobal (the company which created Digix).
The gold is held by custodians and is insured against theft, so DigixGlobal can't just take it (same as your stock broker can't just take your stocks).

No they can't, because there's a 3rd party custodian holding your stocks (usually some huge bank). I'm not sure about "physical stock certificates" though, I think bearer shares were abolished in all jurisdictions in the past decades. Are those stocks of public companies? Which jurisdiction?
Malca Amit is the custodian. 
They have vaults all over the world and have been in the business for 60 years.

Yes, you can recast tokens into a 100g or 1000g gold bar (you need to have 100 or 1000 DGX, since 1 DGX = 1 gram of gold).
Then you can either physically collect it in Singapore or have it delivered for extra fee.

Yes, 100% backed and insured, stored here: 
DGX is a Eth token backed by physical gold (1 DGX = 1 gram of gold). You can't send physical gold to anybody in the world in seconds. And compared to bitcoin, it has lower volatility, so you can use it to diversify your crypto portfolio, or trade BTC/DGX and back if you think BTC is over/under-valued.

Tokens are backed by actual gold, give you legal ownership of the gold, and are redeemable for physical gold at any time.
Actually it is public, since it's on a blockchain. It is audited, by third party auditor, auditing documents are published on their website and IPFS (with document hash stored on the blockchain). Singapore is one of the best jurisdictions in the world for business and storing wealth, better than most western countries. And Digix is of course operating legally, there are minimal regulations for blockchain and physical gold in Singapore, and they are in touch with the regulator.

The gold is legaly owned by token holders. It's held by custodians and insured against theft, so nobody can just take it. The Singaporian government theoretically could, but they are one of largest financial centers in the world, so they are not going to ruin their reputation by stealing assets held within their jurisdiction.
Also DGX tokens are 100% backed by gold (there are independent quarterly audits confirming this), so there's no fractional reserve.

Thanks, but I want to be able to run other cryptocurrency clients on the device, that's why I'm looking for a laptop.
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:16:43
So you recommend not connecting online and having OS without updates?
What do you use for full disk encryption?
I'll use Linux in the future (I promise:) but I need to get familiar with it first, and don't wanna learn and risk messing something up while setting this machine up.
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:27:05
Yes I'm interested, can you please post some links where can I read more about this?
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:33:25
Can you post more details?
Where would be the private keys and Armory installation stored?
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:31:04
I'm using UBS stick to transfer data (encrypted the whole USB partition with Truecrypt and then mount/dismount when transferring data). I know it's not perfect solution (malware could be theoretically transferred on the USB), but my online PC is quite secure, the air-gapped PC will have autorun off and the malware would have to be highly specialized.

What do you mean?

I use trezor for BTC and Ledger Nano for other cryptos
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:42:19


I did see zero balances, but I want to double check it now before I delete the empty Armory wallets and seed backups...
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:41:27
Sweet, this works: 
(Gotta remove the "PrivBase58:" text when importing keys to Electrum)
Thanks ;)

So what BTC-fiat exchange rate was used on the card compared to coinmarketcap.com rate?
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:47:56
How much worse is the BTC-fiat exchange rate used on the card compared to coinmarketcap.com rate?
