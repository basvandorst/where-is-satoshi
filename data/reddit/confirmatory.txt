I'm aware this is a Bitcoin subreddit, but you're wrong. There are altcoins that are more scalable than Bitcoin, either because they've implemented changes such as LTC or they use different technology. Hell, even Ethereum processes more transactions than Bitcoin per day with much lower fees. There are even coins with zero fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:01:17
If they believed price would go down in X period of time, they would short for that period. It does not mean they don't believe in it, it simply means they believe it to be overpriced *at that time*.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:35:37
It is *your* opinion that Bitcoin is an amazing store of value, it is not fact. A store of value is not volatile. It is supposed to be predictable by definition. Bitcoin is a very risky asset, there is no argument to be made. Hell, look at the stickied thread. How can a store of value be risky?
There are *also* many people not fine with the high fees, hence divides in the community and the rise of alt coins.

Not sure where you're seeing me troll. I've deleted a few comments, usually because I don't find the "argument" worth it or I was wrong. It just seems we have different views on what Bitcoin is *right now*.
~~I will admit gold has been volatile at times, as has any asset~~. Actually, looked over the 7, 30 and 90 day charts, it seems the volatility is not extreme. Perhaps in past, there have been periods where the price changed rapidly. Those were likely crashes or corrections. However, Bitcoin is much more volatile than gold by a large margin.

No, not as of this comment. 
The fork happens when BTC mines a block that bitcoin cash does not accept. Or if bitcoin cash mines a block that BTC does not accept. It might take a few hours at the very least.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:38:26
Many miners don't support Bitcoin Cash completely or at all because they expect Segwit2x. If Segwit2x were to fall through, I would expect them to move over to Bitcoin Cash.

Part of the argument is that costs are rapidly increasing and it leads to centralization. (See:

Real estate derives its value from a physical property. Stocks derive their value from a share, of profit, of a company. Bitcoin derives its value from its current real use cases. There is a difference. 
His dad likely doesn't see the value in Bitcoin, because of the lack of widespread adoption. Crypto in general is very speculative. I don't necessarily blame him for his belief regardless of whether he's right or wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:25:09
The deflation nature of Bitcoin in general makes it more attractive told hold than to spend. Why spend your Bitcoin when it will increase in value while you hold it?

Adjustment, correction, bubble, it's all the same. It's semantics, some just sound better than the others. It's all relative too, Bitcoin can still be 'in a bubble' regardless of its performance compared to other assets.

Bitcoin could dip 50% or go up 50% tomorrow, no one knows which will happen with 100% certainty.

The trailer: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:05:35
Since you bring up transactions, the mempool is frequently filled, regardless of how much you pay for a transaction.
If the price were to go to $100k, I would expect and hope there are a lot more users and transactions. Once a solution such as lightning network is implemented, then the price could be justified. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:42:48
Bitcoin derives its value from its use cases. I'd argue those use cases are not the same as gold, therefore Bitcoin is not the 'new gold'. The fact Bitcoin is easy to transact with alone sets it apart from gold.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:21
Bitcoin has its fair share of problems. One of these problems is scaling. Currently,  Bitcoin cannot handle a massive amount of transactions. Thus the mempool gets filled, and there is a backlog of unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:09:03
Doubt you'll get a satisfactory answer, because there isn't one. 
The current existence of Bitcoin is to allow further development so it can achieve what's theorized. You can argue about how "useful" that is. The price is mostly based on speculation about Bitcoin's future. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:14:57

Merchants usually go through third parties. While they "accept" Bitcoin, they only receive fiat money. They never actually receive any Bitcoin. Third parties such as coinbase or bitpay give them fiat in return, at the same amount regardless of if the price goes up or down. There are websites and merchants that already accept Bitcoin, and generally they provide a discount for using Bitcoin as they save on transaction fees. Or that was the case before scaling problems started presenting themselves.
You're right in saying most people do not actually use Bitcoin; I never said they did. You can actually prove that most people are just "holding" Bitcoin:
Bitcoin has seen an influx of new users and money over the past year. This influx has not increased the number of transactions (
This does not necessarily mean the new users are not transacting with Bitcoin. It does mean the average Bitcoin user is transacting less. There are multiple possibilities:
•As user count increases, the majority of old users transact the same while the majority of new users do not transact, lowering the average number of transactions per Bitcoin user
•As user count increases, the majority of all users transact less, inversely correlated to user count, lowering the average number of transactions per Bitcoin user
•As user count increases, *some* new users transact while the majority of old users do not transact, lowering the average number of transactions per Bitcoin user. Due to the there being many more new users than old, the majority of new users cannot transact and keep the number of transactions the same as a year ago. 
The majority of old users are transacting the same, less, or not at all. While the majority of new users are transacting less than old users, or not at all. Therefore you can conclude, a majority of new users are strictly holding or are more likely to strictly hold, on average, compared to old users. Since there are many more new users than old users, you can further conclude most Bitcoin users are holding.
Based on this, there is an extremely valid argument for a bubble. 
There is also lot of speculation and people assume the price will stabilize over time making it more useful. How true that is, I don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:22:37
Bitcoin has been able to handle an influx of new users in the past. Now, there are scalability issues affecting the average user. A frequently filled mempool, huge variance in transaction fees from week to week, etc. A solution needs to be implemented soon, whether it be lightning network or something else. Until then, a $100k price seems absurd to me.

@_date: 2017-11-30 06:23:37
Not sure how common it is. It would be hard to determine. Prices between exchanges within the same country vary by a few hundred at most and due to the volatile nature of Bitcoin, fees, etc it may not be worth it. Prices between exchanges in different countries vary much more, providing a much better opportunity. However, some exchanges require verification and if may be hard to get fiat currency into the an exchange in another country.

Part of it is probably the deflationary nature of Bitcoin. Essentially, if Bitcoin will rise in value over time, why would you spend it today? 
Other factors are high transaction fees, volatility, etc 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:12:34
6000 is an arbitrary number. Because Bitcoin is so volatile, it takes a relatively huge drop in price for it to be considered a crash by most. 
It depends on how you look at it, if you view the price going down as a correction, then it's good for the market. If you're losing money, it's bad for you. You should research more, read the stickied thread, etc.
You really should not be taking investing advice from reddit though.

Since Bitcoin is open source, you can take its code and "fork" it to make a different coin. You can fork any software. However, unless you have some 'support', it won't have any value or be successful at all. 
Forking isn't inherently bad either, it can be used to upgrade software. However, forking without consensus leads to money split between Bitcoin and its forks. 
The price of Bitcoin is stabilizing, or should stabilize, over time. It isn't stable yet. There will be corrections and dips, however people believe in the long term Bitcoin will continue to increase in price.
