How can you say that if 1BTC worth more than $600 USD and hasn't fall under $200 USD since the Chinese biggest rush-and-fall?!
How can you say that if it is absolutely clear that 1BTC will never cost $1 or $2 USD again?!
What can you tell to those of people like me who didn't see any advantages of ugly bitcoin network back in 2009/2010 and literally throw it away?!
Aren't all of those people "missed the train"?
I know you say speculation is not a point of bitcoin, rather focus on freedom, fast payments and bla-bla-bla. Oh please, left it for open-source programmers who don't believe in USD!
We the people need fast growing MONEY. And, yes, many of us "missed the train" called bitcoin.
We need another one. New one! Based on new idea!

Man, I know want you mean and I am with you!
I don't know what all the folks around are talking about " 0.01% of humanity" or any other social things.
The FACT is 1 BTC ~ 600 USD by far.
The FACT is it was around $10 a year ago or even $2 two years ago or even totally free all the 2009.
The FACT is we both MISSED THE TRAIN called BTC.
I personally throw my bitcoins away in 2010 cos I hate the idea of ever growing database and messed wallets compared to Russian WebMoney system.
Now I miss the BTC bubble. I want China pay my millions of DOLLARS!!! Oh, shit I LOVE MONEY and I hate socialism and those who think bubbles are bad. This is money! The fact is each bubble is money!
Bitcoin never was a payment system for me. Now it is a PROFIT system.
You know what? I know the answer. Just follow Satoshi Nakamoto who is actually Jed McCaleb himself!
He refused Bitcoin and focused on the next system called Ripple ( Check it out until it is too late to make profit!
P.S. I am just yet another crazy Russian.
