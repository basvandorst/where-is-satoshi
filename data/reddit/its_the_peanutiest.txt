if you just eternally hodl and only trade internally without ever cashing out, does one still need to claim on taxes?

So what's the way around this since I don't believe you can choose individual addresses to send from like you can in MEW.

I wouldn't even know where to start. No more Turbotax for me. Why oh why did I get involved in cryptos...

Its all about diversification.  All?  No.  Some? From what I've been seeing, absolutely.

I know on Trezor hardware wallet (I'd assume other wallets can do this as well) you can set up multiple wallets and have a dummy wallet for $5 Wrench style situations like that.  you keep your main stash keys in a different password protected wallet that would be strong arm thieves wouldn't know about.

I'm assuming you mean *Ledger* or Trezor.

The journey from Trezor to Kraken is killin me right now.  I was caught off guard.  Silly me and my trader aspirations.
