If you put your life savings on finex you are a retard
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:29:59
Cool story.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:30:42
Always the people with little or no money on there that are pretending to be the most outraged.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:31:52
That would be nice but it would take a while for finex to pay everyone back if they aren't getting fees 
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:02:47
Oh wait let me make some posts about how I'm the victim for sending funds to an unregulated exchange based in god knows where. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:24:19
wow people will complain about anything.  Making me change my password? like omg man jeez.  Grow up baby
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:42:59
They need to have funds to cover the run on the bank that is likely to happen after restart. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:50:00
maybe its the miners
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:11:09
How about not selling yours till you have info?
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:39:01
I'm saying if they go bankrupt people get nothing.  I'm perfectly happy with this plan.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:59:21
you can't get trades placed in 2 hours? are you retarded?
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:22:08
Yes obviously thats what alot of people are doing.  lol.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:56:01
Yeah, and its doubtful you have that you have much money on there. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:28:51
If you had money on there you'd sing a different tune. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:38:40
If you keep saying it enough, a blue unicorn appears.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:02:53
How about taking responsibility like an adult for sending your funds to an overseas regulated exchange?  I lost money too but I knew the risks and I'm not crying like a baby. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:52:37
Not in my time zone either but I seem to keep up pretty well
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:57:14
If you had 10 grand on there you wouldn't be posting about precidents you'd probably be more on my wavelength.   Since you have like 40 bucks you can talk philosophy.   Yes I'm schilling I don't want to see them shut down just yet sorry. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:57:34
it will be transferable. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:27:24
I doubt they are giving Bitcoin back probably usd equivalent.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:35:57
Yes I am.   Will I use them again  I don't know.   I know if there is litigation I will get far less years from now.   I can care less about the precedent at the moment.  Since you don't have much to lose,  you care more about precedent than getting money back. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:51:44
or the higher the incentive to move to alt coins which are also part of the free market. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:15:17
Yeah do that so you get basically crumbs after years of litigation

 "Poloniex site seemed a little amateurish. I'll stick with Cryptsy."
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:21:27
I lost a lot of money on there.   I full well knew the risks so did everyone else.   Greed takes hold then when something like this happens they blame every one but themselves for being retarded.   
Ps.  most people talking about litigation have nothing on there. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:30:45
The same guy who thought bitcoin was dumb for the first few years?
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:18:57
I'm sure other exchanges will have it traded.
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:48:24
Same with me.  Thanks BFX
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:09:07
what about retards like you that sent your money to a random offshore exchange then blame everyone but yourself when shit happens. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:52:35
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:07:10
If you are retarded and don't want anything back for years then involve lawyers 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:27:59
Oh?  They advertise as legit well that solves everything.   Let me send them 50 grand.  So much better than those exchanges that advertise as not legit.   No people need to learn to research and understand risks before blindly sending money to random people period.   Again as I have said most people talking about litigation like the op have nothing or next to nothing to lose. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:33:23

No you won't get more out of it,  your lawyer will though. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:31:22
Doesn't mean you can't trade them on other exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:48:19
Again, bitcoin is risky and most of the business involved are pretty shady.  Bitfinex doesn't have the best reputation and you still had money on there knowing this.  Please stop playing like you are blameless. I lost money on Bitfinex too btw, i totally take responsibility.
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:43:42
Yeah sorry if I'm taking responsibility for my investments. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:40:10
Accept the haircut then do what you need to after.  Also use Bitcoin to transfer out next time.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:40:11
If you don't have anything on finex why do you care.  Those of us that do are far more happy taking at 36% haircut then having this tied up in litigation for years.   
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:24:39
Satoshi intended for the size to be lifted.  In any event I don't care, I have been strong supporter since 2011, have since diversified.  Competition is great, but that also means you have to compete or get left in the dust.  Bitcoin 79% market share, down from 95% not long ago.  Not sure which point people start to think there is a problem.
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:11:52
Look a concerned buttcoiner
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:14:24
most of us traded on bitfinex because of margin trading. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:11:14
Can't even give your name or lawyer firm? Seems legit.  Website?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:23:30
Most of the people threatening to take other action have no funds on finex.   They are just stirring up emotion. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:29:21
Just btc and usd lenders 
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:17:52
People moving to altcoins.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:41:58
Funny how people have no personal responsibility.  You sent lots of money there, (probably out of greed) fully knowing the risks, then play victim when shit likes this happens.  You should be happy with 36% with them trying to make you whole rather than them going into bankruptcy and you getting crumbs. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:16:37
They did release the terms
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:48:13
Look if they went to court you'd get a lot less years from now.  Also doubting you will go the legal route for 4k.  Sending your money to random offshore exchanges is risky, now you see why
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:03:12
Zane says you will be able to withdraw. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:26:45
Don't forget supply shortage of stolen coins (for now)
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:17:36
Yeah and let everyone get basically nothing.  Seems legit.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:38:27
Right but mostly because you've been taught we are all equal and the same.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:31:02
why do you say that?
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:45:50
  I believe this is what they are using
Edit: no totally sure that is the platform just guessing.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:44:42

@_date: 2016-08-06 16:53:47
Can be counterparty token.  Can even pay dividends on counterparty tokens I think.  Don't have to worry about miners etc either.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:41:11
I'm fine with that. Part of the risk of sending your money to random offshore exchanges.  You on the other hand have nothing to lose and are the most dramatic.  Pretty funny.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:48:29

You can sell them for Bitcoin on other exchanges. (when they add it)
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:49:33
no i would have lost less.  I only had ETC and USD in there.  I knew the old plan would piss the most people off.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:04:57
Yeah so instead of the company working to pay all users back, let's tie it up in the courts (where they will socialize losses) for years so that people get crumbs if that.  No thanks mr stein.
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:19:25
I just don't like the fact that people that ridiculed people like me for years or wrote bitcoin off as dumb are determining its future.  Adam Back, Bram Cohen
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:20:30
It's the people with no money on there pushing for drawn out liquidation while most people with funds on there are happy with this plan of action
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:29:12
Maybe they are tapping into another api till their trading starts?
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:06:14
Yes you will be able to withdraw.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:34:30

@_date: 2016-08-10 16:16:49
Yes its an IOU, trade accordingly.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:47:37
Some exchange somewhere will list it, the demand is too big and $$ to be made.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:39:58
and how much money do you have on finex?? Oh yeah probably none. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:30:26
Thats a good trading day for me.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:43:14
Then there should be lots of demand by people to sell

I've noticed the people pushing for liquidation the most have no funds there 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:55:48
not sure if a token is needed. When it happened to poloniex they just paid back slowly and had a progress bar in your wallet screen to show how much was left to go.  They also had a box to check if you wanted to donate whatever was owed to you to the rest of the people.  I donated just something extra to keep in mind.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:31:51
I do t really care I'm "happy" to get 64% back.  This is just extra.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:01:41
Oh Lord better sue them so you get even less 5 years from now. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:38:25
The legacy banking system is alot slower than bitcoin and they have margin trading for assets.
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:26:24
Regular trading (minus BFX Coin) will be allowed for US residents am I right? I realize that also we wont be able to margin trade in the US anymore. That sucks but I understand.  As long as I can trade out of fiat into crypto.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:21:35
Not totally sure, someone told me that in the chat room.  They are familiar with it because thats what Tether uses.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:57:53
I believe in taking care of my own people, before others.  It's usually only white people that talk about helping everyone else, mostly out of guilt.  Other groups look out for their own best interests.

Yeah I'm sure you really care about people who have money in finex.  Sleezeball
@_date: 2016-08-13 13:33:21
I never fully quit bitcoin, but I diversified.  I've been hardcore supporter since 2011. I never quit because of fees.  I stopped believing when blockstream  and a few Chinese people started controlling the direction of the code.  Network effects are great to have but it doesn't mean you will have em forever.  
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:40:46
Just got my withdrawl to my wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:29:17
No I'm sure they will release what happened but are also dealing with a shit show of getting the site back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:07:40
Helmut trying to help you by making finex go down in flames so he can short.   Banned me for pointing out the obvious.   
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:22:43
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:36:42
Don't sell them at first then.  Wait it out for a bit at least
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:03:36
No I got it pretty quickly after requesting actually.

What do you want me to do?  Bitch and complain more?  Get a lawyer and send them to bankrupcy?  Make some long reddit posts saying how it's a scam?  Sorry have better things to do.   Let me get my money back then we can have conversations about philosophy. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 02:01:09
Most of the people threatening and being dramatic had nothing on there. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:39:18
Where is your personal responsibility for putting way too much money on an offshore unregulated exchange? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:37:41
They already said they were settling at 604.  Not sure why other exchanges matter here.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:00:51
I dont think it takes very long to create an asset on Omni.. or counterparty etc.
@_date: 2016-08-31 15:21:57
yes thanks.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:29:57
You can trade them off site when an exchange offers them.
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:30:42
They weren't even around for the first couple years.  Bram used to ridicule Bitcoin people.  When a private company and a few miners can meet in a room and dictate the code policy, then bitcoin is shit.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:42:47
other exchanges will certainly have it.  There is probably a legal reason they are doing this. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:54:21
Pretty sure they didn't update their website after the CFTC changes.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:04:13
Zane already said it would be transferable.  They will probably use omni and create an asset on there.  Its not hard.

@_date: 2016-08-31 20:48:33
most alt right people used to be libertarians, until they realized that its a suicidal ideology like liberalism.  Libertarians believe we are all equal.  Just give those Somalis a copy of the constitution and let them read some Jefferson quotes and they will be just like us.   Of course just like liberals, libertarians preach open borders from their super white places like New Hampshire.   Or super Asian places like Japan (Roger ver).
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:19:51
1776 because our founders believed in open borders and mass non white immigration like Johnson.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:15:29

Edit: yeah a buttcoiner
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:39:31
Having a token will probably open up all kinds of regulatory headaches.  I say just do what poloniex did.  Have a progress bar in you wallet showing how much is left to owe and pay people back. I'm sure they will be paying back usd equivalent and not bitcoins. Also an option to donate your remaining owed balance to the cause is something else poloniex did.  No need to over complicate.  The quicker people start seeing something returned the quicker they will trust.

Bitcoin is losing market share because of core and thymus.  If you havent noticed most of the people that have been in bitcoin the longest are on the big Block camp.  Lots of people pushing for small blocks weren't around for a lot of the early days, so I find your example of America funny.  Adam Back, Bram Cohen etc, pushed btc aside for years, now apparently they know what's best.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:47:22
Dollar equivalent is safest way.   If bitcoin went to 3000 tomorrow they would never be able to buy them back
@_date: 2016-04-13 03:06:48
These are things you can't stop, there are also about 10 or 15 MMM copycats out there at this very moment.

Sorry I should have said paper wallet in the title.  I am not suggesting that hardware wallets be disguised as tampons. I do not think paper wallets need to advertise that there are Bitcoins on them.  Someone should make a site that generates private and public keys and lets you put them on advertisements etc like this one. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:59:55
Price does matter.  If Bitcoin was 2 cents for the last 6 years noone would give a shit.

Are these hubs anonymous? Will KYC information be needed to use them in some jurisdictions?  Sounds like a nightmare?
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:27:45
Well I'm talking about paper wallets.  No reason to have something that says Bitcoin wallet on it.  The more disguised the better in my opinion.  I would like to see a paper wallet site that generates QR codes and gives you a large selection of strange things to put them on like this ad.

@_date: 2016-01-21 12:34:01
Does this exclude empty blocks? 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:34:24
This is just a paper wallet that I made.  The QR's are my public and private keys.  If someone stumbled upon it, they would not know I owned Bitcoins, unlike all of the other paper wallets we have today.  
I should have said paper wallets in the title.

Some speculate MMM was one of the main drivers behind the latest bull run.  It entered China somewhere around April and a few hundred thousand Chinese put lots of money into it expecting huge returns.  Its basically a pyramid that promised 100% returns per month.  The only currency used was Bitcoin
***Just speculation here but I think this dump wasn't just because of Hearn news, but some MMM insider selling Bitcoin before the news was given to the Chinese. ***

Usually the people that preach open borders make sure to live far away from the diversity they say they love.   Roger ver is a good example.  Preaches open borders yet lives in Japan.  One of the safest homogenous nations on the planet.  
Bruce Fenton is another one.   When he's not preaching how awesome Islam is,  he is preaching open borders.   Of course he is rich enough to live away from the diversity,  but wants you and your kids to be enriched.

You are forgetting the fact that the resource is limited artificially.  A better analogy would be that your rock star refuses to move to a bigger arena even though its available.

The people that are actually for "diversity" actually are against "diversity" because they advocate to just mix everyone up in a boring mish mash so everyone is actually mixed together and brown with no differences.  If everyone is the same, then why is diversity important.  Hmm?  it does not surprise me that you are British.  Brits are hell bent on replacing themselves.  Only whites have this complex that they must be "diverse".  No other group on the planet willingly calls for their own blending out.  Also something I notice with brits, and most diversity lovers is that they choose to live in some of the whitest places, while championing diversity.  So odd.

The loudest voices on the small block side, have VCs to make a profit for but no one ever questions their motives. It's clown world.

The differences between humans and races goes way deeper than skin color.  There are real physical and mental differences.  To say everyone is the same is just throwing science out the window.  White countries are the only countries that are using government force to force integration.  "diversity" means fewer white people around.   Whites are starting to catch on though which is why nationalism is taking hold.  People like you are great because you wake whites up.  Again you say how great all these othet cultures are yet advocate for blending them out.  Make up your mind.

I've been in BTC since 2010.  Apparently all those early devs, and all those early startups are enemies of Bitcoin now.  All these newcomers know whats best.  Blockstream which has VC funding is is not questioned and they are seen as gods. So odd.  I've moved on to other coins so I can care less, although it is a pain when bitcoin crashes.  Btc lacks governance and your fights will continue to rip BTC apart and it will erode trust.  Good luck with your fights.

@_date: 2017-10-04 15:54:32

Yes it is good to question VC funded companies and how they influcence bitcoin, but we draw the line at Blockstream.  Noone should ever question their motives
or question how they plan on giving a return to VC's.  That
is off limits.  Bitcoin is hashcash with inflation control added, so we must not question Adam.

Look at the world.   People self segregate.   Diversity is only forced on populations deemed "too white".   Only whites are told ethnicity isn't important while everyone else sticks with their own.   If ethnicity isn't important then why do all these companies in Silicon have to have forced diversity initiatives? It's the people calling for "diversity  that choose to live far from it   Clinton and Zuckerberg are great examples.   Also most liberals and libertarians.  
Diversity creates conflict,  and if you want to get down to it,  it's a slow ethnic cleansing of people of European decent   but spun as something awesome. Can you name some non white countries that force multiculturalism on their people?

The western world is quickly moving to nationalism as multiculturalism is being forced onto the populations.

P.S.  I've been into Bitcoin since 2010, Adam wouldn't be involved for a few years after because he thought Bitcoin was dumb.

Coinbase has done remarkably well for Bitcoin, what have you done 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:18:26
noone cares, this is been going on for years.  This is why Bitcoin will continue to lose market share.  But by all means continue your soap opera. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:54:24
Only because bitcoin is paired with alot of coins on exchanges.  More pairs have been added as of late, leaving less need for btc.  Bitcoin has competitors that are actually more advanced.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:36:28
But having blockstream in charge is totally fine
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:01:19
Noone in this sub will believe anything because :
1:  He doesn't fit the mold that you want Satoshi to fit personality wise  
2: He is for bigger blocks. 
Apparently he is some 2 bit con artist, YET he is smart enough to hack Satoshi and steal all his shit.   And they say the other sub is full of conspiracy theorists.

Good guy ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:03:59
So the big blockers weren't spamming now? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:34:44
How about cashing out into other coins that have governance and actually pay their nodes to run? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:36:48
He screwed with litecoin investors too before activating segwit.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:28:58
It's been forked many times.  Bitcoin will find it very hard to compete with any coins that pays devs, nodes, and for marketing directly from Blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:16:02
Remember the Hong Kong agreement that people like Adam and Luke and Peter Todd were a part of,  then decided not to do it.  Haha good times.  
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:17:43
So how is blockstream supposed to make money? Great.. you've been in since 2010.  Adam (your hero) apparently isn't as wise as you. lol
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:16:20
Lol not happening 
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:28:48
Border security isn't just walls.  He wants to make it as easy as possible for anyone to come into the US.  Good luck with your small government utopia while letting in millions of che loving socialists that will out vote you. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:57:02
OK I guess that could work 
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:38:40
Changing pow might be simple but you are just going to create an Altcoin with very little hashing power behind it.  It's does make you sound tough tho. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:41:55
I remember when I used to think like you.  How cute. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 02:57:32
need a safe space? Tumblr?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:48:53
That will have almost zero support by Bitcoin companies and users.  You guys have gone crazy 
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:01:10
This is the explanation I needed
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:40:55
Good luck with those slow ass block times. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:54:10
I guess that will do?
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:18:21
As long as that 70% doesn't happen all at once 
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:46:39
Doesn't ether have more nodes than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:35:08
You need to activate you atm card then do some extra stuff on bitpay site to link it.
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:28:44
Yeah this is why libertarians will just be fringe.  Demographics don't matter...  they believe in magic soil.
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:35:56
Why would I want to send money to someone who wants the borders wide open?
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:03:15
Thats coming.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:18:21
Oh just less than half cool.  
@_date: 2016-07-13 00:13:15
please god let this be the last time we touch 666 so we wont see these kinds of posts anymore.
@_date: 2016-07-14 08:03:41
It's Sam Hyde! 
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:42:18
Core also promised a hardfork to 2mb and then made the chinese miners look like idiots.  Lets see what happens at the end of this month. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:37:25
Um there wasn't a coding flaw. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:11:14
If current transaction trends continue how long before each block is 8 GB?
@_date: 2016-07-16 02:57:07
I'll be a master of effected and affected when i'm 80
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:21:24
if the rocket doesn't launch at halving i will be very upset.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:21:14
of course it exists.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:53:16
Lol yeah good luck with your alt coin. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:58:30
Actually that is how Bitcoin was designed.  Love it or hate it. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:00:11
He is pretty much for zero border security.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:09:50
Bitcion still has a governance problem.  Lots of us will never be back. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:02:35
at current transaction trends, how long before we would get up to 8 gb blocks?
