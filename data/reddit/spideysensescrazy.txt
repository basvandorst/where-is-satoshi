ok so seeing the new article, being from Korea, does that worry you at all? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:17:28
from what you're seeing there you don't think they will go through with banning bitthumb and coin?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:16:51
apparently all BS
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:18:25
It has been confirmed that it will go against chips.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:17:18
Its about cracking down on exchanges that don't follow regulations.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:52:38
it seems like each exchange has their own bank. Saw anothe rbank for another exchange

Satoshi gotta lay off those cigs

Poor Charlie. Anytime this guy tweets we start taking out the CSI inspection kit and look for clues and most likely semen.

@_date: 2018-02-02 14:38:21
No. Would probably have like $6.85 in nickels.

Probably getting a 9-5 at a local Starbucks where he/she will rise again and become King!

If I had a nickel for every time someone called 8k...
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:05:06
holy shit. i didnt refresh
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:49:09
The entire market in general? Around $40k but I got in at good times so my portfolio had been looking pretty
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:25:49
i was no joke down $5k for the first time since I started in early September. I don't even know what red looks like overall. Within an hour Im up 10k. Still down a shitload from last month but still nuts

Husband? It can go either way. I don't discriminate against genders.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:56:01
thats what I feel. Price to the side, seriously the last couples in the news have been amazing for crypto in general. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:34:26
Not me. I was curled up in the fetal position on my bed.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:11
Mind. Blown.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:32
lol what exchange are you watching?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:52:25
I get where you're coming from with all of this but if the Tether manipulation is indeed true then that entire rise was most likely artificially done so unless something is going to manipulate it again, which I don't see it happening, then i dont know what to think...

Feedback: Horrible day to launch anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:33:56
If i had a nickel for every time someone wanted to confirm me shitting in a reddit user's house...
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:59:23
I think whats worrying people is the second part of that sentence when he mentioned the payment system. No one knows what he meant
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:47:25
Great Scott! Can you take us back to the signing of the Constitution as well? I always wanted to check that out
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:47:57
Will that help him find my shit?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:26:37
I have some potentially bad news. I took a shit somewhere in your house. Good luck finding it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:09:30
