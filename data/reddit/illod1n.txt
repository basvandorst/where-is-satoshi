ok, well basically I started off with $36 in BTC.
I was hoping to buy like $4 worth of different alt coins here and there as trends change, let them grow a little, then eventually rebuy back into bitcoin.
Now. If make all my $4 purchases from my btc wallet, I will lose half of my original stack to the fees.
Would it be smart to just bulk buy in one transaction into a coin that's only worth $0.04? and use that as my home base? Then I only have to worry about fees getting out?
I've basically been using sites like bittrex and coinswitch.
What I need to know is-&gt; what cheap coin can be used in this way and stillallow me to hit all the other coins?
Basically I'm wondering, how is it possible to even do what people call "day trading" given so many fees.How can this all be scaled down so I can work with my meager $36?

on localbitcoins when i sort out "requires id."
(for reference, i am homeless and out of state, hence i have no access to a bank account or ID)
i get terrible deals like 9000 per BTC. PAXFUL is more straightforward and gives me a percent ratio which is a lot more readable. Also i did not need id.
I ended up selling my $50 card on paxful for $36 in BTC.
i used my laptop built in webcam to take photos of the credentials and i got paid instantly.

I just don't see why changing a total of probably 8 bytes of data has to cost $3.20? What am I paying for here, last i checked the electrical cost of sending 8 bytes of data was .000000000001 cents. So, I feel like someone is being VERY greedy here.
Also. God forbid i ever actually wanted to buy something with my coin. I mean, if there was a 3.20 tax on every thing you ever bought you would be dead due to inability to buy what you need.
I thought this was supposed to be a currency. How are people even supposed to buy stuff with it if its .0008 BTC per transaction? WTF? when do they change the scaling of the fees, because clearly it is not dynamic with $$ value, or they would leave it at something low and it would change to reflect that.
