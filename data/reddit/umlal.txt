Mr congressman,  I have a personal question, what is your private bitcoin address?  Just curiosity. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:28:00
I think the user should have the ability to block a list, and even used pre-made filter lists. I wouldn't want my client to be able to send money to addresses that for example, in the possession of a known hacker group(like a virus with a known pre-fixed addressed), or addresses that have their private key known to all, like songs lyrics or memes and such.

Fuck! I wish they had some PAL games... FUCK!!!

Why not just using a brain wallet?

They didn't, they archived it. It has been proven, Someone who deleted his account requested it back after a year of absence and they applied.

Hey, Ask to get payed in bitcoin.

Some clarifications: He is really a registered ltd company(under his mother name).
He is really sure that it is more secure to give him your bitcoin instead of remembering a password.
@_date: 2014-01-26 10:04:12
You should use BIP0038 to generate a private key that will be encrypted with a password, and give him the password.

Wait didn't Bitcoin filed for bankruptcy?
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:17:33
I say he should do this. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:32:34
I heard that interdimentional trade is now available thanks to bitcoin.  Also you can trade bitcoin with your future self,  I heard he is pretty rich.

I bet BTC-e knows more about you than you can know about BTC-e. They are literally anonymous.

Sometimes I don't think government have any interest in public safety.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:57:00
I think that a lot of people would sacrifice time in order to make their money safe. I don't care to wait a minute or two if it means no one can steal my bitcoin.
Edit: I remembered coinbase. They usually take a minute to approve transactions to merchants, If you don't need to deposite in advance why should we deposit to an exchange.

He is probably using rotation.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:25:57
It's not stolen.

This is why we can't have good things.

I think you are wrong. its much easier to work as a white hat, being fully black(not gray) hat, is something that comes after years of practice and experience.

Would you stop with this etransfer crap?
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:37:16
I personally think that the price is stale because no one really knows how they lost it. 
If mark actually lost the private key than the price should go up(more demand). 
If they were stolen, than it should still go a bit down, but realise that many gox users who got burn haven't lost faith in bitcoin and will purchase some delicious coins.

I gave an example, If I remember correctly in bitcoin its around 9min and in lite coin is around 3mins.

Why not just lower the time between new blocks (Lower the difficulty, from 10 to like 5), I think this should have been done parallel to lower the block reward in half.
same original reward less time interval between blocks more transactions can be processed.
