Put $70 in btc into a wallet and just give him the private keys.

You're using another banks ATM, of course they're not gonna make it free...
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:56:26
it looks for a certain range. Not for an exact number. So if you did RemindMeBTC! 1000 and bitcoin was 995, it would still message you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:43
Keep your btc in an actual wallet. Where you hodl the keys. Not on coinbase, not on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:23:52
There are Bitcoin ATM'S everywhere now. Find the one closest to you
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:48
Let's say the fork is tomorrow at 4:00pm. If you transfer your coins to a wallet by 3:59.59 you will get the new coins. If they are still in the exchange, you get nothing.

Keeps me awake at night too...I keep staring at the price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:15:40
I do too, I'm just saying it's super easy for newcomers. Also, if coinbase were to fail, you can expect the Bitcoin price to plumit anyways.

I thought cobinhood was an ico. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:47:12
That's still less fees than Bitcoin. Also, my bank account doesn't make me pay to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:21:42
It will either take DAYS for the transaction to go through, or it won't go through at all. And at 0 sat/b, that's probably what will happen.

Yes you get the new fork if your wallet is offline. The fork is basically copying all your BTC. So if you had 0.05 btc, you would have 0.05 x-btc. You could start a fork as well, but know one would think it's worth anything.

Coinbase made it super easy for the non tech-savy. It's basically like visiting your banks website.

If Bitcoin hits a 100k, that $10 would be ~$120ish. You won't make too much profit. I would invest in smaller altcoins like IOTA or Ripple.

Ive never heard of expired status on coinbase...or on any other wallet/exchange for that matter. Screenshots?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:20
with blochain, you own your Bitcoin. With coinbase, they do.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:55:36
I'll work on that soon.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:38:39
Some proof would be nice...like a website, charity  or ANYTHING at all
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:55:22
its not a regular loan. Its my father... There is no interest.
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:01:00
I don't know if bitcoin will last that long, but crypto currencies definitely will
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:58:12
Are you talking about the 10 BTC with my father post? because we have not bought the BTC yet, this is my own funds.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:20:10
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:15:20
Yes he sent me 0.01 btc, my mistake
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:56:47
I know bitcoin cannot be refunded...
I am asking how to get it back from the site or the person i loaned coins to.
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:49:39
Someone just send me the 0.001 buy in cost, should i join? or should i keep it?
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:45:33
can i use these parts to mine litecoin or etherium? And do those have good return?

I also sell Bitcoins, for good exchange rates depending on how much you are buying.
I'll sell to you, how much you need?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:34:52
That must fucking hurt. I would lose sleep thinking about that.

There's an app called mycelium on Android (maybe iOS, no idea) make sure to back it up, it'll give you a 12-20 word passphrase, and write it on a piece of paper just in case you lose your phone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:36
Sell your Bitcoin, thats basically shorting. Then buy back when it's low.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:33:29
People are just jealous.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:21:26
It's real, but in CAD
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:09:18
Probably....but definitely not linger for a few months. Probably linger for 1 month max
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:45:06
Coinbase is pretty easy, but it has a $100 weekly max unless you upload id. But please don't keep your coins in coinbase, just buy it and send to your actual wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:40:14
If it's easy to find with a search, why didn't you just search it and let us know in your original comment?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:03:17
How much are you thinking about buying? Coinbase allows you to buy $100 a week without id.
