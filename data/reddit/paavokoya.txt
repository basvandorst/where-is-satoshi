Imagine we had a dynamic limit for bitcoin supply.. The more txn's per day, the more btc released..  Do you think that could possibly skew certain incentives for miners? Similar is the size limit.  If high bandwidth miners are able to inflate the txn count they can force other miners with less bandwidth off the network giving them a higher probability of finding a block.  With a hard limit, there is a guarantee of a ceiling to stop this problem from spiraling out of control for a while (allows moore's law to catch up)

The bitcoin network has never had consistently full blocks.  When the network stops processing transactions smoothly, people will begin to turn away from it.

I promise you no one in these banks have any idea about the real life implications that trustless ledger incentives bring.  They think the innovation happens in the "tech math numbers stuff" when in reality the innovation is in the "trustless" aspect of it.  There is no other reason to use a block chain than to have complete and unimpeded control of your place in a digital ledger without authorization or permission from anyone else.  In fact, a block chain is extremely trivial and over-complicated for what banks *think* they are going to use it for.

The problem I see is the polarity such a system like bitcoin creates.  It creates a cognitive dissonance in society where one must come to terms with the crumbling of the old way and all that means for one's safety and social status.  Humans are extremely habitual and crave comfort.  Bitcoin, to most, means rethinking the current system and leaving it behind.  Many don't want that simply because they fear the unknown and expect utter collapse of civilization, which in reality couldn't be further from the truth lol

I don't think you're flaming anyone. You have relevant points that for you probably don't have a need for bitcoin. Just like someone who is fine washing dishes by hand has no reason to use a dishwasher. Eventually over time though the security (I give no information other than a bitcoin address when ordering games or internet services, so no one can steal my identity or CC info) and accessibility this gives to third world countries (that have to pay 40% of their income to send money back home) will become the de-facto way of spending money online. More and more things are becoming digital and global. Bitcoin is internet cash (bitcoin can be anonymous if you try) and has a lot of tricks up its sleeves (smart contracts) so it's got a long way to go before the average person has any reason to care

All of these responses are extremely over the top and unhelpful.  Circle and Coinbase are like PayPal, they hold your bitcoins for you and you keep an account that you can move later.  They are the best places to buy bitcoin for now.
Once you have bitcoins though, it's a good idea to move them to a local wallet under your control.  Breadwallet (iOS) / Mycelium (Android) / Electrum (PC/MAC)
Blockchain.info's wallets are different from coinbase and circle in that you don't hold an account with blockchain.info, rather they act as a sort of interface for holding your private keys through encryption.

A few good ones that offer all of the best qualities:
Breadwallet (iOS)
Mycelium (Android)
Electrum (PC/MAC)
All of these use a hierarchical deterministic seed to generate addresses and convert the seed into a string of 12 words.  That 12-word seed should be backed up somewhere safe (on paper in your sock drawer etc)  If you break or lose your phone, you can redownload the app on a new phone, type in the 12-word seed and have access to your coins.
Personally I keep several bitcoin on breadwallet and don't worry about it.  The apple framework is extremely secure with a pin-code set to open the wallet.

Good.  I hope they are.  I come from a time when there was one bitcoin exchange and the reddit had just formed.  Bitpay has sped up the utility of bitcoin for me personally beyond any measure.  Bitch about "selling pressure" all you'd like thats your insecurity about your investment talking.
If you had any patience whatsoever you'd realize it starts with the merchant not accepting bitcoin, then saying "I guess we'll use bitpay", then the merchant realizes they don't need bitpay and accept bitcoin directly.  It's a process, get your head out of your ass and look forward.

Off blockchain txns won't work on OpenBazaar or dark markets due to trust and centralization.
I agree this should be a top priority for all devs and we should begin seriously pressing this issue.
We need to be forward thinking here and prepare for the possibility of mass adoption before we are forced to implement a broken system (incorrect block size measures) due to time constraints and public pressure.
People are constantly touting the overthrow of the old financial regime but unless we want to end up like Egypt or Iraq, we need to have a strong and well developed infrastructure to cushion new waves of adopters before that's something I would feel comfortable seeing.

democracy by definition is supposed to be decentralized.. "each individual donates a portion of opinion to create a majority" .. yet the ENFORCEMENT of democracy is flawed... meaning it is centralized people who carry out the opinion of the nodes.. which ultimately centralizes the ability to act on the will of the mass or to act in own best interest..
with something like bitcoin, mathematics enforces rules rather than centralized players.. yes, i understand code dev is somewhat centralized but node operators (anyone willing) can run code without the parts they don't like.  And as altcoins come into existence frequently, people who disagree with bitcoins new trajectory, they can switch to another (better) coin at will in seconds.. which will leave corruption behind as humans vote by usage on the best coin

I agree, it's interesting that only a designated sector of humanity is allowed to write history or what is considered "knowledge".  Wikipedia already adheres to the out-dated model of "important sources". Imagine Einstein's theories in the 1900's or Darwin's ideas in the 1800's and how those had to break through historical barriers... It never ends does it... Even with infinite possible wisdom we remain monkeys scribbling on walls

As I said, all things are a commodity. Meaning you can literally trade anything for anything.  So of course USD will be able to trade for bitcoins. A lot of people still value USD, and until they don't (many varying reasons could lead to this) I will always be able to trade USD for bitcoins.  Just as USD can be traded for GBP or CNY.  There are hundreds of currencies that interact.  The "USD" value system you are referring to only matters to you and not someone in Russia.

No algo can be ASIC resistant on a huge scale.. the incentive to mine MUST be rewarded through corresponding effort or "work".  Even PoS and such become centralized over time... look at LTC.
Also, many believe bitcoin would be dead with a centralized mining operation, which is false.  We are living with a highly centralized economy today with fiat.
Bitcoin devs are merely "suggesters" to the miners and mining pools.. No miner is forced to implement new versions of bitcoin. Each miner can democratically choose if they want to implement the new version and if enough believe a new implementation is bad, they can systematically "vote" to not update and find new devs to code what the majority of miners and bitcoiners want.
Think of it like a country, the more and more restrictive or harmful a countries laws grow, the less you're likely to move there.  The same thing will happen with bitcoin.  If a dev writes a shitty new update most won't implement it and will avoid it or even just cut it out of their code on the node.
I agree that sidechains will be a huge part of the future of bitcoin and will likely open up avenues of possibility we can't imagine yet (much like the internet).  It's nice to have a healthy discussion about these things

That's an incredibly overstated "deflation" you're using there..  Have you ever actually borrowed on credit? It comes with interest which is usually in the 5% range..

All of these are local wallets (the private keys are stored on your device). And these particular ones create a 12 word seed which you can write down on a piece of paper and as long as you keep that piece of paper safe you will never lose access to that wallet even if you break or lose your device.

The opposite is exactly what is happening to fiat... If you save it (the capital in capitalism) then you are guaranteed to lose purchasing power... Does that force you to speculate or gamble your money in the stock market? Ever wonder why stock market crashes every so often?

Seems an easier answer is to enforce a very tight timestamp sync across the network with very fast smaller blocks..  This creates a forking issue but I believe it's one of the only ways we can scale up in such a way as to support global commerce.
This also creates a problem with slow nodes being "forced off the network" and creating a naturally-centralized-through-speed-distribution network and also leaves full node runners at the mercy of their ISPs.
I look forward to the day someone can solve this problem.

With the continued rate of inflation (creation of new bitcoins) the supply for a brief time during bubbles is not able to keep up with demand.. While after the hype cycle and bubble is over the demand drops rapidly and supply remains constant (meaning price goes down)
The only thing keeping the bitcoin price down is the miners having to sell bitcoins to cover the cost of electricity/rigs.  While at the same time no new adopters/money coming in.

Exactly.  Even with all the stored commands and hashed code, there would need to be a compiler installed on the victims machine that could decrypt and execute said code.  That's not to say you couldn't implant software with this capability unknowing to the victim.  But if that's the case, you're already "in" the machine.  Why not just implant the original malware into the software that the victim downloads.

The interpretation of the word believer seems to be what is tripping you up.  No one is implying it's a religion or something that needs to be worshipped.  Bitcoin requires a certain amount of faith (just like all systems) to maintain a user base.  The word "believer" in this case simply implies that you trust the math and algorithms in place to uphold bitcoin's ecosystem and provide a useful platform for value transfer.

Yes in fact they do.  Bitcoin allows everyone to participate in the global marketplace without banks.  Banks are subject to government intervention and seizure.

Last I heard (around 6 months ago) it cost ~$150/bitcoin to mine.  Miners sell bulk on the otc markets for cheaper than market price since it's still profitable to do so.  Then the large batches of btc hit the exchanges at a profit to the sellers. So they usually don't mind market selling and driving the price down.

Think of your bitcoin address like an email address.  Anyone can know it and send you emails.  But unless they have your password they cannot access your emails.  Similarly, bitcoin addresses have "public keys" and "private keys".  
A private key is what gives a person access to spending bitcoins.  A public key is what is broadcast over the network to verify ownership without revealing the private key.  
If you are not the sole person with the private key then you are trusting whoever else not to steal or lose it.  This is why many suggest having your own local wallet as many businesses have ran off with user's bitcoin.

Value systems are macrocosms of supply and demand that find equilibrium over vast amounts of time. USD has been around for hundreds of years. Bitcoin has been around for five.  Artificial inflation is constantly debasing the value of a dollar so the price of goods will always rise albeit very subtly.  This the value is always changing.  Just because you (in a little microcosm) cannot judge the value of a muffin in bitcoin, similarly a Chinese consumer cannot judge the value of that same muffin in USD.  As such, perhaps there is an African whose national currency is worthless and so he uses bitcoin everyday. I'm sure he might be able to judge the worth of that muffin in bitcoin.

All currencies inherently represent goods and services. USD is created from the lack of these or in other words "debt". Real money HAS to be scarce by definition.

I wasn't commenting on the privacy implications simply the potential for true innovation regarding bitcoin based systems.  You sacrifice plenty of privacy using the internet to unload your thoughts, ideas, and motives.  There are plenty of websites that track everything their users do and sell that data for profit.  However, there are plenty of tools at one's disposal to counteract these tracking methods and maintain privacy.  I expect the future of bitcoin to be much similar.  The sheep will always be sheep, the wolves will always be wolves, the honeybadgers will always be honeybadgers.

This sort of environment encourages "illegal" activities.  It is in the best interest of the government for everyone to feel in a legal safe zone so that citizens support a system where their best interests are not threatened.

DISCLAIMER: OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTIONS ON USER BASE GROWTH AHEAD
There are ~2 billion internet users today. Let's assume that jumps to ~6 billion by 2100 (conservative estimate).  Let's also assume each person in 2100 makes 2-3 txns a day on the bitcoin network.  15 billion txns a day with $0.01 fee = $150 million in mining rewards per day.  That's about 75x greater than the current reward scheme at today's price.
I am fully aware that processing that many txns is laughable to most but I'm also aware that it took humans 50 years from making the first airplane before they landed on the moon.  Anything is possible.

The reason interbank transactions take 2-3 days to clear is due to fraud protection. And the receiving bank has to confirm there are funds in the sending account.  Fraud protection is covered within an hour in bitcoin.  There is no trustless fraud protection in any current form of fiat interbank transfer.  And it's unlikely there can be one without a distributed and cryptographically-secured public ledger.  The only way to have that is to do the opposite of what you propose.
Also, consumer transactions *are* interbank clearances.

All money is imaginary points just with more importance.  Every "point system" has its own level of importance in society and in someone's life.  Think of money as a representation of "social energy".  Whether or not someone receives money does not mean value was not transferred, it was simply not represented through the medium of money.  Now imagine you are a listener to a talk show and you hear someone give a fantastic speech that changes your life and you want to make sure that person can spend more time devoted to giving those speeches and developing further ideas without having to work for money elsewhere.  I believe your worries stem from a place of what can happen when people get *too much* money (corruption, greed, power-mania)

Absolutely, I agree.  But you have to remember we're dealing with a global phenomenon like the internet.  Is there a supreme leader of the internet? How are standards handled in protocol changes like ipv6?  Most changes happen very slowly and it really doesn't matter what new protocols they change unless everyone adopts en masse which rarely ever happens (unless a dire or urgent situation).  Even today most full-nodes are operating on 2 year old bitcoind software.

There are several definitions pertaining to guilt.  Personally,  I would never attach an inward emotion such as guilt with legality.  So in my opinion, "guilt" has zero weight within a legal context.  
I understand the state uses the word itself in order to make one internalize the state's disapproval of an act but as an individual separate from the state, I do not accept that definition of guilt.
Perhaps "unlawful" would be more appropriate than "guilty"

Means nothing if you cannot transact with them.  Literally piece of paper with numbers on it.  Absolutely worthless if you cannot afford to transfer them to another person.  Even worse off than gold to be exact.  Imagine bitcoin is *global* store of value..

I'd somewhat agree.  Reminds me of post-revolutionary France with existentialists idealizing of a free state with a self-regulating anarchy.  While I support this notion and envision its grandeur.. there will always be the few assholes who grab the torch of opportunity and come marching in with guns just because they can.
The purpose of creating a publicly operated political system is to maintain a defense against such outside or foreign attackers.  Even though defenders can become corrupted from within, the power to overthrow them *must* remain within the public realm.  It is only a matter of time after that power is revoked before overarching power grabs from defenders breed an internal revolution.
EDIT: I realize this has little to do with bitcoin, just got me thinking about the concept of anarchy in general.  Luckily bitcoin's resistance to censorship is what maintains that the overthrowing power stays in the public realm.

Another way of looking at it, is that USD is making massive gains against the stock market and people are wanting to get into USD/fiat currencies anyway possible.  Whether by selling stocks or by selling commodities.
Until bitcoin is widely used and accepted in many places, it will remain a commodity or store-of-value that rarely interacts with the broader world markets.  Perhaps a bitcoin-based stock market would help bitcoin's fiat-price stability in global market movements like this.

Bitcoin changes very frequently.  I'm suggesting that people plan ahead for which fork they are going to choice when the time comes.  If you are unprepared you can find yourself being forced to an unfavorable (for you) fork simply to be able to trade goods.  Bitcoin is *technically* non-democratic but *socially* it is.  If you want to be using it to exchange with other people they will have to be using the one you want them to be using as well.  This is why it's important to have established goals and a well thought out plan of action.  It's important to propagate the action plan also.  Uninformed people love picking sides based on illogical means.  Clearer plans are often favored.

Think of keeping bitcoin on your personal device like keeping cash in your wallet or under your mattress (cold storage)
Now think that certain bank-like institutions use bitcoins instead of dollars and insure your money up to a certain point (just like fiat banks).  How do fiat banks secure your money?
Bitcoin the currency can have all the same rails of operation as fiat.  Now if you choose to use the bitcoin network then you are your own keeper much like with cash and physical security.

I can tell you've never used any exchange you think you know so much about..
Several exchanges use pool funds as credit (much like a bank) and offer a yield on stagnant coins left there.  Many fractional reserve (high-leverage) exchanges have multiple platforms which include direct fiat conversion which they charge for on top of no-fee trading.

Exactly.  A spam attack is meant to fill up the mempool due to over-crowded blocks which slows down confirmation time.  If we raise the block limit, the spammers will have to use 8x the outputs and fees.

That's correct in how margin works but orderbooks change very quickly during sharp movements and sometimes blow past margin calls before the exchange has time to post it.  Which means someone has to cover the "10x" that was lost.  Usually a lender with real btc is involved when using margin.  With futures in btc there's currently 50:1, there is no lender and the exchange takes on the risk.  This is my understanding of it.

Centralization in a different way but correct.
In regards to mining:
Mining conglomerates can work together (through BIP100 voting) to raise blocks to a size that only they can propagate (using super fast bandwidth/mem etc) which in turn can make smaller nodes/miners lag well behind the network (if they have slow connections). This would diminish the small-miner share of the market and further exacerbate mining centralization.
EDIT: A few researchers have said the network can currently handle ~10mb blocks without much disruption.  Which is why I support BIP101 and predictable, non-manipulable max block size growth.

The problem with this "service" is that it directly compromises the functionality of the bitcoin network rather than simply participating (running full nodes) and taking notes (gathering info). It is actively inhibiting transactions and propagation while forcefully breaking the privacy of certain users.
It's especially concerning considering the leaders of Chainalysis involvement within Kraken (an exchange with full access to the identity of their users) and Mycelium (a widely used personal wallet) providing the possibility to connect full dox and ip addresses to much of the network for personal and/or commercial gain.
This action *could potentially* compromise the full financial records of these services' users while at the same time crippling the network's payment system.

This is true, but it's not unwise to think of a nation's economy as the first domino to begin the collapse.  Historically, there have been plenty of empires that collapsed due to economic factors.
And by the way, bitcoin enables the masses rather than disables the masses.  So it's unlikely that bitcoin's rise will bring about societal collapse.  More likely it will neuter particular governments.

Solvency.  In 2008, all the major banks had a large portion of their reserves tied up in derivative markets (literal gambling) and were making enormous profits with the majority of the public's money.  Then when the derivative market crashed all that reserve was wiped out leaving many banks with no money to give their customers when they came asking for it.  What the "bailouts" were was the government allowing the Federal Reserve to issue new money to the banks to fill their reserves and remain solvent.

Coinbase is a bank for bitcoins.  Sometimes they take a while to broadcast transactions and they are the ones holding your money.

Everyone in this thread is oblivious to how forex/stock/commodity markets work yet continue to have the magical answer as to why there was a bubble.. 
This entire market from the start has followed traditional "technical analysis" lines and market fundamentals throughout each bubble.  Market traders control the price of everything.
If you cannot speak the language and read the patterns it's as though you are aimlessly deciphering hieroglyphics.  Of course it will make no sense to you.
And this "willy bot" shit reminds me of people who believe in god.. They read an easy, simple to understand explanation for how it all works and believe that is the sole answer.  Mt. Gox wasn't the only exchange operating during the $1,000 price bubble ya know.  Every other exchange saw people buying/selling at the exact same price with real USD and real bitcoins.

If you've ever actually bought anything with bitcoin you'd know there's always a visible address next to the QR code that you can easily copy/paste into your wallet.

Right now the world needs a slap in the face in terms of economic growth and resource consumption.

Is there a case of coinbase terminating an account that had a one or two "buffer" addresses the coins were sent to before a gambling site?  If so, then I think you may be correct, but if you send directly from coinbase to a gambling site, you're using their payment network (along with bitcoin's) to facilitate that transaction which directly ties them to the gambling site in which case they'd be held liable if accused in court.

Thanks for clarifying.  This is extremely well thought out and glad you're bringing your expertise to the space.  I understand that at the moment this is a derivative platform but eventually you hope to see it become the standard marketplace for actual price discovery among assets?

Yes, totally understand.  I mean that's what we're witnessing with bitcoin adoption in general and bootstrapping an "out of thin air" economy.

The easiest way:
Download 'Mycelium' from Android marketplace.  WRITE DOWN THE 12-WORD SEED THEY GIVE YOU (VERY IMPORTANT).  That 12-word seed is the master private key for every address that wallet creates.  Make multiple copies of it and keep it safe.
Then send whatever bitcoins you plan on buying to that wallet using one of the addresses it creates.  If you lose or break your phone, all you have to do is re-download the mycelium app and type in that 12-word seed and your wallet will be accessible.
If you do not want to keep your bitcoins on your phone if you feel it's unsafe then simply do the above and delete the app.  Then whenever you want to access them use that 12-word seed.  Make sense?

imo not all coins are shitcoins if they present a *substantial* improvement (economically or technologically) to the cryptocurrency space.  most at this point are absolutely unwanted or not needed and often are harmful to decentralization (pre-mined etc).  that's not to say they don't work as an experiment but can corrupt the overall crypto-movement if needlessly takes up more space and attention than should be warranted.

1. Let's assume Bitcoin is already the de-facto way to send money.  Then they have no incentive to "promote" anything.
2. All it takes is to send a tiny fraction of btc to Coinbase and watch it travel through the Coinbase backend revealing other addresses.
3. Offchain transactions don't mean anything if you can't get real bitcoins off the exchange.  See: Mt. Gox
This raises a good reason why bitcoin anonymizing features need to be implemented sooner than later.  It is beneficial for governments and businesses alike to stay anonymous concerning private debts.

All those problems you suggest come from "under and over valuations" of a currency etc etc...  If everyone used bitcoin, there would be no separation or misrepresentation between currencies.  All nations would be operating under a unified valuation system and therefore be on an appropriate valuation with everyone else rather than off-kilter central bank whims to which the market reacts strongly.  "Adapting their money to their economic circumstance" is just another way of saying "getting a new credit card to pay off the old one".  It doesn't fix the problem, just prolongs having to deal with it.

I'm sure they're just covering their asses for kycaml laws. Not sure it's mandatory though

It's ironic when people say "USD is backed by the government" when there is nothing written anywhere in law or otherwise stating the value of USD is tied to anything.. which is exactly like bitcoin.. it's all decided by the market rate..

I actually think blockchain.info is one of the worst wallets around.. but we haven't been talking about that because you've been blathering on about credit cards for an hour.  You can fuck off now.

Technically true.
"Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government[61]) from "making a tender" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment[62]) of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation,[63] unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank[64])"
EDIT: I LOVE THE DOWNVOTES FOR POSTING THE CONSTITUTION

Good.  I wish you had left with them.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:07:48
Is this true? Source?
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:47:19
Are you arguing with the constitution?  Because I literally just posted the constitution and no opinion of my own.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:40:29
litecoin no.  peercoin yes.
mainly because peercoin uses a centralized clearing house and isn't really decentralized..

"This decentralized network is totally awesome but the decentralized incentive to operate it is a joke.  Only a centralized incentive can work because .. uhh .. the value changes .. and .. economics.. It's totally possible to have a centralized core of bankers run this decentralized network.. right?"

USD = currency of the future because Wal-Mart fucked up a transaction.

Just like how data collection killed email?

Exactly this.  Quit giving the biters free publicity.  Just build your trusted and solid product and people will want that.  Shit look at apple.  They overcharge everything and people pay for it just like people pay for rolex.  Go for the upper echelon and top quality.  When securing a large amount of money, people are willing to pay extra for the best.

Sorry, just seems like more reading could be done.  It's not just bitcoin that has exchange rates.  Literally every commodity/currency in the world works in this same way..  Think of a never ending auction where people are bidding and selling.

There are many merchant services like coinkite, bitpay, and coinbase that utilize BIP70 which magnet links to a wallet and autofills all the necessary amounts so the user only has to click "send" to pay.
It's really quite genius and intuitive. You can read more here:

This is maybe the first title of an article that I've seen defend bitcoin as much as most msm bashes it.  HAHA LOVE IT!!

You should get rid of this option entirely.  You are missing a lot of revenue from processing it seems... Not worth it for whatever "logging-in" does for your business..

Bitcoin is more than simply "instant and free transfers".  What the blockchain carries (the currency) is more important.  The highway was revolutionary, but it would be pointless without a decent vehicle.  Same goes for "blockchain tech"

I used a VPN on an irc network once and it linked to some other user so everyone in that channel thought I was that guy.. IP addresses mean nothing.  What a fucking joke.

I would suggest never downloading a file in an email unless it's from a close friend.  No sane business would ever email you a packaged file.  They would host it on their servers and send a link for you to download as you could verify the domain.

technically they could all be anon with just "usernames" but the escrow itself (the multisig txn) would be the only way to leave feedback so you'd know that both parties were involved.. Maybe a small fee for the escrow dispute overseer to disrupt potential "false reputation spam"

This kind of in-fighting among "bitcoin news sources" reminds me of american wrestling (WWF / WWE) and is so goddamned lame. Please don't upvote this.
