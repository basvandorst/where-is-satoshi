Wrong, no, but it depends on your goals. As safe as possible? not even close.
I think you should always have a back up. It is also a bit safer to have your back up use a different seed, and password. That way if someone get's your primary password they cannot take all the Bitcoin from the back up.
So say you are at a coffee shop, and someone watches you type the password. If you are using a seed as a password than they can gain control of the whole wallet.
If you use a different password than they would need physical access to the wallet for the password to do anything.
I am less concerned with my smaller "spending" wallet than my cold storage wallet, so your goals matter.
If you just want to be safe, you should keep some in cold storage with the seed written on a physical device. Or even better encrypt the seed with a password you will never forget. That has the same level of effort as you use now, but is much safer. No one can rob you through key logging, and even if someone has your back up they could not get the BTC.
Another choice that is easy to do, is to set up a multisig wallet. Have two people you trust on it. That way you need 2/3 people to use the money. Even a robber with your PW wont be able to move it, but you can see he tried and then change it. If you ever die, your two trusted people can get the money without a problem
If this is for $10 who cares? if it is for 10K I would never use a seed as a primary password.

A fork is just an Alt coin, if it is not accepted as Bitcoin by most people. So yes any fork could and has happened.
It would not be the end of the world because I would just keep using the pre fork code.
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:21:23
This could be a problem from the current code but I think it is easily fixed with a patch.
There are two patch option (which are actually the same for BTC owners)
1) change the code so units less than a sat can be sent. We can always expand out and allow smaller and smaller units to be traded. It is digital so there are not physical limits. They have to pick a limit, and they went with a sat, but they could expand the limit in the future.
2) Air drop BTC to each address equal to the current balance times 1000. This would lower prices by 1000 but each person would have 1000 times as much money so we are all exactly as wealthy before and after the drop, but we can trade in larger units. This is different than inflation today because banks get the money first, it is not divided based on current holdings of money. So instead of acting as a wealth transfer it just changes the units of trade
My guess is they would use option one, but allowing people to trade a thousandth of a sat, is is the same economically as the second option where we all have a thousand as much bitcoin.
Since it is digital we can always cut the sized smaller and smaller, the limit is just the current code.
A final option that takes no patches, is to use a lightning network. We can have credit on the network that is far less than a sat. So I can buy coffee for 1 millionth of a sat on the lightning network, but the BTC block chain will only record records if they are over one sat.
I essentially have credit on the lightning network, after some time if I have accumulated a few sats I can pull that into the official block chain. The big transactions would be recorded there while small ones are done on side chains.

you could use one wallet and add a label to the business public addresses (or just use one business address). Or you could use two separate wallets just so you know they wont get mixed up.  My wallet lets me write a note on each address, so I can remember what I used them for. 
Typically people create a new address for each transaction but using a single address would make book keeping very easy. Block explorer will list the exact time,  date, amount and address of the sender,  for every business transaction you ever had.
So you could have wallet one with addresses
A: business
B: business
D: Personal
In which case you always send or receive from address A or B for the business. You would add a label so you do not forget. Typically the wallet will have a quick drop down of labeled addresses to send or receive from but I have not used Trezor
Or you could have wallet one + wallet 2
Wallet 1
A: business
B: business
C: business
D: business
Wallet 2
E: Personal
F: Personal
G: Personal
H: Personal
The short answer is as long as it is on your wallet you will be fine.
If it is easier to have different wallets so you do not have to track which address go to business and which to personal that would make sense too.
Good luck I am glad to hear you are planning to use crypto in business. I was very confused at first but after a few transactions it will all make sense.  It is really great for donations and I try to support companies that offer crypto donations.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:58:24
I am almost positive my wallet allows me to schedule a payment. If you can ensure the wallet is running after you die you can schedule a payment a few years down the road.  The key part I am trying to avoid is needing to keep my wallet running
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:43:51
There are other stable coins.
In the first few minutes people will panic buy BTC. This will create short liqs on leverage sites. Then the tether pairs die. You expect other stable coins to trade above $1 
After the dust settles BTC is not tether. The fact that tether is trading near $1 means that people using other coins are willing to buy at this price. 
I do not care what you do though.

There are almost no scenarios where it goes to zero. I think a very large crash could happen if
1) The UN bans Bitcoin and all nations put huge effort into prosecuting ownership. It is permissionsless but there will be less people wanting to buy it. 
2) There is a 51% attack, and people switch currencies instead of forking BTC
That is all I can come up with TBH. I think the price would rise in a EMP attack or nuclear war. Cell phones are the last to go down, and so long as there is a satellite people can use BTC. Banks, ATM's, and digital transfers would go down before Bitcoin. 
On the other hand the government is probably in turmoil, so no one will want fiat. The apcolapse would be a BTC gold mine. Regions with war and unrest tend to move to crypto, as the local currency collapses.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:08:31
There are predefined rules. My wallet will not accept transactions that break any of these rules.
If a miner were to give themselves a higher reward no nodes on the network would consider this to be "real" bitcoin. They could say they have 1 trillion Bitcoin but every other person will ignore them and keep the block history running beyond this point.
In fact if they did this I would steal the hash code for the block, add a valid mining reward and get free Bitcoin. 
There money is worthless so there is no point in doing this.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:58:21
I have never checked the accuracy of them. Economically I am assuming that if the returns are high than everyone else will buy making it unprofitable.
Is the 100k estimate gross or net? What are you assuming electricity costs to be? If you are trying to mine BTC I am  the pools are so large that you would be unlikely to even hit a single block. But I have never mined seriously before so that comes only from my current understanding.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:39:47
I was a moron and fell for one of these, being in a rush I did not check the public key or the download.
If you have your keys or seed, do not turn on the computer, and import them on a clean system. If you are paranoid start a new OS or run a Virtual machine.  Immediately move the BTC to a new address and wipe the system

@_date: 2019-07-20 18:59:27
I do not see a problem with leaving it. What do you think the issue would be?
If you transfer the money from one address to another all you are doing is paying a network fee to have it on another public address. It will still be associated with you.
I am not sure what level of understand  you are at so I do not mean to patronize. The wallet does not actually do anything special, You could import the private keys from one wallet to another and spend the same money. All that stores the Bitcoin is the blockchain and the wallet is just an easy way to interact with the block chain. 
Your wallet will store hundreds of public private key pairs. So you simply post one of the public keys as your donation address, and then the wallet knowns you own that money.
If you bought bitcoin else where a new public address would be used. If you had one BTC in donations, and one in purchases your wallet will show that you have 2 BTC, but if you send it without specifying and address it will pick one. If you spent 1.5 It would move 1 from the donation address and 0.5 from the private address.
For privacy that is not great. Your name is tied with the donation address, so if I see that the other address sent money to the same location at the same time as the donation address I would know both belong to you.
If you are not worried about privacy than there is no need to worry. But if you are you will need to do more than get a new wallet.
Over the course of owning a wallet you will likely have thousands of public address.
I hope that helps

I would never recommend doing something illegal.
However hypothetically I would recommend going on vacation and then spending a lot of vacation money
The block chain does not store things based on location. No matter where I am in the world I have my Bitcoin. There cannot be a bitcoin tariff or customs checks it just exists on the internet. If you happened to have bought a large amount while abroad it would look like you spend a lot vacationing, but any Bitcoin you bought there would still be with you when you go back to India. If asked you can show you spent all the money on your trip and not on Bitcoin, it is not suspicious. 
If that happened you could buy stable coins at any point, crypto exchanges do not care about ID. So one could trade freely on the market with any Bitcoin they had from vacation.
I would also hypothetically recommend using a Bitcoin mixer, or changing through a private coin. One should hypothetically cold store it, where no one would have any idea you own it, or run a VPN with a kill-switch when trading on a hot wallet.
But like I said no one should do that.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:51:09
Someone should jump in who is an expert with coding wallets, but I think this would be trivial.
I am not sure if this is what you are thinking of, but you can set up a script to watch the public address. Once a day it checks if the balance of the public address changed. If no than it reduces the count down by one. If yes it set the count down back to five years. If the count down goes to zero it send your private keys as a message to a wallet address you specify.
That way five years after you die the person would have access to your private keys, but only they can open it.
You could do the same thing with an actual wallet, but then you have to make sure the wallet stays online after you die. 
IDK just a thought. Is there a reason you do not want to use a multisig custodial wallet?

3 ways
1) Binance, Bitmex, etc charge lower fees if you use high volume. If you are spending a lot they want you on there platform so they lower prices. This creates liquidity for the rest of us. There are no network fees on the exchange so they can make millions of buys and sells for very little cost
2) The fee is per transaction, so if I move $1 of BTC it may cost me 10 cents for a 10% fee. If they move 10 million dollars of BTC the fee is still 10 cents for about a 0% fee
3) you are over paying for fees. I know of exchanges with 0.01% fees if you wait for a bank transfer.

The state wants to bottle neck Bitcoin. This is done on purpose, you only run into the problems on regulated exchanges accepting USD.

Sure I agree with what you are saying. A proper reading of the first amendment would prohibit banning Bitcoin.
My point, which you seem to agree with, is that they have consistently interpreted the constitution in a way that benefits the government.

I would recommend getting a hardware wallet if you are going to house money that matters to you. That makes the money very safe
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:16:50
My point is that you should assume the system is compromised. BTC wont move magically.
If you have no reason to think the seed was compromised it is more likely the computer or network is compromised. Obviously a virus gets on a system without you knowing, and any method you use to check is far from full proof.
It is your money but I would be extra safe. If you want to test, generate a new wallet using the same software install. Then add $1 ans see if it gets stolen. If it does  the computer is compromised 
If it does not someone probably has your seed. But again the fact they have your seed almost certainly means the computer is compromised. You have to think how they would get it?
It should be written down on paper, so it was either stolen from your house, or else there is a key logger or other spyware on the system.

Congrats. You are very early to the party by the way. In 60 years you can say you got in before 99% of people. We all think we got in late, except for people in 2009-2010. People buying at $20 were beating themselves up for getting in so late. I think you will be very happy in 10 years
My only recommendation is to spend a little. I try to hold as much as I can, but there is something special about knowing you used it to buy things.  I have bought some software, and a couple cheap things like soap. But if you expect it to go up than it is silly to spend most of it. On the other hand not spending any somehow loses the magic for me. 
Most people lose at trading. If you want to put in a couple of sats for fun that is fine but treat it like gambling. Keep the vast majority in HODL mode.

Internally the price should increase. people wishing to obey the law will sell decreasing global price in the short term. 
Then if I want BTC it is more risky, sellers will only offer me the Bitcoin at a premium. Cocaine is very cheap to make, most of the cost comes from the risk of smuggling it.
 BTC is much easier to transact secretly than other illegal items. I would sell from a legal country to an illegal one, if they have a way to pay me, but the principle should be the same. Probably a slight increase in price

For an easy purchase Gemini, Coinbase, local bitcoin, many other if you already have crypto. 
Be aware they are taking a fee for your desire to have Bitcoin now and simply. If you use the "advanced" websites like GDAX or register as a trader on Gemini you are charged less for the exact same thing.

Change your wallet. If you are using a high fee it should be on the next block. The only reason it is not "confirmed" is that your wallet requires say 20 confirmations before it is considered real, change it to 2 confirmations or 1. The transaction only took 5 to 10 minutes.
Since you are waiting to get USD that is on them and not Bitcoin. 
If I reasonably trust someone I will be fine if I see it in the mempool with a decent fee and move on. I know they can "reverse" this but if I know them, or it is less than $50 I do not mind
Also lightning networks are a thing if you care so much about speed.

I do not think you are missing something, but I am also not worried.
If a 51% attack would happen we can reorder the blocks by consensus, and then change the mining algorithm.  This would be very bad in the short term but I would not panic in the long term.
If these miners did this we know who they are. The top firms are known so they would be hit with major law suits. 
Even without a law suit they are investing heavily in crypto. If the price tanks because of a 51% attack they lose out on future income. If BTC went to zero there rigs are worth zero as well. 
I am not an expert on mining but that is my thoughts abut the incentives at play.

I looked at the site you listed bellow. The only one reported to give 100k is on prerelease. As they note, the return is very uncertain since it is not on the market. 
You can assume that it the returns start at 100k a year, than a lot of people will buy the mining rig. That reduces your return. So even if true supply of hash will increases and your returns will decrease bellow the expected result. 
It is better to look at rigs with an established return rate to get a more accurate estimate. There numbers look a little high to me, but the ROI is still going to only be 5-10% a year at best. You have to realize that the money spent on the rig could be invest in other places. So each dollar of electricity, and each dollar spent on the rig could have bought BTC, or stocks. When you account for that the returns are probably going to be low at best.
If yo are not sure I would recommend buying BTC and read about mining as a hobby. If you feel confident later you can always buy a rig with the BTC
You can buy a rig later with BTC you buy today, but a bad rig cannot buy BTC later. Best to wait until you really know what you are doing since the decision is one directorial

The 12 word phrase store every address of the wallet. That is all you need (or anyone else) to recover your entire wallet with out without your computer. Some people have done the math, but it would be very hard to guess the 12 words. So it is safer than it seems. Much safer than a standard password
If your wallet has a password, than the data is scrambled on the computer. The only way to unscamble it is to know the password.
So a thief would need both your computer and the password OR the 12 word seed. Keep that seed very very safe. Do not save the 12 word phrase on your computer in that case all they would need is the computer

Many of them are entrenched in the current system. There investments are based on the monetary policy of the FED and they see no reason for an alternative currency. Dollars work well for them so there is no need to switch from there perspective.
Innovation is rarely understood by the old guards.  Software was considered a bad investment over hardware because it was not physical like goods of the past. They just have trouble having a different perspective, than what is useful to them.

I was imagining signing the message with their public keys, and your private keys. That way the information is not stored as clear text. Since  what is being sent is encrypted you can safely run the script on a server that is not your own computer. When they have the message they can decrypt it using their own private key. Basically how encrypted email works
Personally I do not see a conflict, since my goal is to leave the Bitcoin to family after I die. I do not need to ask permission to do this with a multisig account which I see as the main goal of Bitcoin. But I can respect this view
From my understanding a mutisig is technically a smart contract, where the rules are 2/3 people must agree to move the money from the contract.

There is a long term work around but you will have to wait for this transaction.
What you can do is transfer money to coinbase and hold it as dollars or USDC coin. Once those funds have been there for a while they can be transferred right away even if you trade for other coins.
So if you store 3k in USDC and want 1k of BTC you can buy it and withdraw right away. If you want that money in as cash in your regular bank account you can move it over.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:05:08
You cannot know.
We do not know how many addresses are linked. I may own 100 public addresses with 0.1 in which case I would have 10 BTC. An analysis of addresses would show that 0.21 is larger than all of those. You can do a more complex analysis try to associate addresses but this wont get everything.
A average comparison is easy. There are there are about 7 million BTC and 7.7 billion people so the average BTC per person is 0.0009. So you have roughly 23000% more than the average. You have to be above the median but I do not know what percentile
Of people who own BTC your relative amount will be much less, although probably more than average.

Say you want 1k in BTC

Because the government wants money and they will do what they want.
It used to be the way you said since that would make sense,  but it was changed last year.
In 2017  you would pay income tax on the 10k you used to buy the Bitcoin,  a sales tax on the car, a one time ownership registration fee with the DMV,  a yearly registration fee for keeping your car, and a  sales tax if you ever sell the car again,  but not capital gains tax on the Bitcoin used to buy it.
In case you cannot tell I am not a fan of the state I think they are extortionists. I would never condone illegal things, but one could get "a sweet deal" on the car and if some BTC showed up in the sellers address as a thank you for selling at such a low price, I think that would be more than fair. The gift is not taxable so you would not be paying capital gains tax, and he was nice enough to give it to you cheap so the sales tax is lower.
But of course you are not paying for the car with BTC, I cannot stress that enough. That would make it  illegal to not pay taxes.

They are completely  different coins.
The reason there prices often correlate is because general sentiment of crypto will change the price of all coins. If people feel good about crypto adoption both BTC and BCH will rise, if there is bad new about crypto both will decrease.
The reason for the similarity in names is that Bitcoin cash forked from Bitcoin. That means they copied the code that  runs Bitcoin, changed it some, and then started the block chain at the same point as Bitcoin. From that point forward they are compete independent of each other.

Honestly 12 days seems kind of long. I have had it take that long but not much longer. To check in the app try to withdraw, when that fails click the info button. It should say there is money on hold and the date it will be available. 
Ill give an example of what I mean (I know it is weird)
say I have $4000 in my normal bank account
* I want $1000 in BTC
* I wire $2000 to the crypto exchange
* I wait 12 days
* I buy $1000, in BTC and $1000 in a stable coin (USDC, Tether etc)
* next week if I want $1000 in BTC I buy with the stable coin
* I can instantly withdraw this BTC, since the money was there for 12 days
* I then move another $1000 from my bank and wait 12 days, this gives me an instant slush fund
* If my bank account is low and I need $2500, I sell $500 of the stable coin and wire $500 to my normal acount
* This get's sent within 1-2 business days because the 12 days are over.
Basically I turned the exchange into a bank account, but one that lets me instantly withdraw crypto currency when I want, while not reducing my overall savings if I need cash. 
In your current spot I would call customer support if it takes much longer

I play an economist so I have thought about this some


Yes and no. Other things take electricity, so they could also be said to be making a "floor" as well. What I think is special about BTC is the electricity has no time component. 
Today wind and solar have issues meeting demand and specif times of day. Electric is not made equal. However cheap electricity can always be used for BTC mining. 
You would be surprised that some cities shut down power production, because you need the electricity to always be equal to consumption. I think the that extra wind power could now just go to mining when off times. 
But if I can produce steal with electricity, and the dollar output is better than mining than steal is the floor not BTC. Since BTC is mined in places with "free" electricity I think it will never be a floor in cities unless the grid is flooded.
For mining the time does not matter, so renewable in the mountains have economies of scale per watt. But economically these scales provide less profit when sold to consumers. So these scale will make it so that BTC mining is never profitable on grid electricity.  


No it would become a low risk asset but not a no risk asset. If the economy crashed (although I think this is less likely on a BTC standard) than there is less stuff to buy. That means the BTC will buy less stuff. 
Since people care about stuff and not having BTC in and of itself there is still a risk. However prices will be counter cyclical. If people are worried about the future prices decrease and BTC buys more, if people want more stuff today they will spend more and prices decrease. 
I wold say prices will look a lot like Gold up to 1960, except they would be more stable giving that new "mines" cannot add to supply. 
it will likely be "risk free" in that if you save BTC it will buy more in the future than today. Just as I can buy an Iphone for less than an old flip phone, as the economy developes the same amount of money will buy higher quality things.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:02:02


What matters is the circulating supply. Assume BTC is the only money, and 99% of all BTC is held in storage, that means 1% (or 210,000 BTC) Will be the money supply. This number can increase significantly so the economy is not stuck
What is unclear today is that money is the trade off of consuming now versus consuming later. Absent inflation people would save more yes, but then the market will equalize. People need and want things today so they will trade some BTC for those things.
But that however increases the circulating money supply. If there is only 1 BTC in circulation and I spend 1 than prices will decrease by 50%. People would want to spend rather than lose value on BTC, up until the circulating supply reflects the trade off of spending today vs later. So if time preferences decease, meaning people want more stuff now, than the circulating supply of BTC will increase and each BTC will buy less things today. If timer preferences increase than more people will save and BTC will buy more now. This acts to stabilize the market
This balances future wants with present wants. A big problem today is that with inflation there is less investment. I know my USD is slipping away every minute of every day, so I prefer to use it right now. This makes people under invest, over spend, and take on too much risk when they do invest.  In the gold standard people used to save there money in a bank. This made sense, but now the FED takes 3% of  all money and gives it to bankers. These average Joe people cannot save money so must either, 1) take on debt 2) Invest in things with returns over 3% which is much more risky.


Fees should be unchanged. The supply of blocks is fixed at one every 10 minutes. Users are bidding to be on one of those blocks. They do not care what the hash rate is at all.
They are each biding for a slot on that block, which remains the same no matter how many people are mining.  So the fee is only related to the demand for transaction on the network.
This means that the overall mining reward will decrease. There is no longer a inflation tax on users going to miners. So some of the more costly miners will shut down.
So fees should be the same and mining should decrease. All else equal.
However the important question is harder to answer. Because things are not all equal. If the value of transactions goes up, than the fees will increase and there may be more miners.
I could see large Lighting networks each needing to bid larger fees per block than we have today, even if the per user fee is lower. So we have increased adoption by say 10000% but fees decrease by an average of 2000%. That would mean each transaction costs less than a cent, but the overall mining reward of fees is 500% more per block than today.
I would say the decrease in mining could be a problem. Once a 51% attack is feasible something needs to change. If this does not happen because of increasing fees per block that is great. If it does get close I would expect Bitcoin to change the mining algorithm which is any easy enough fix.
Coins like Monero already use an algorithm, that limit the effectiveness of larger hash power. Right now you are basically entering a lottery where your odds are the number of hashes your computer puts out, divided by the overall hash of all computers. Large rigs have advantages because they can scale to be thousands of times more hashes per unit of power than you or I
However you could make the algorithm be the natural log of hashes gives you a ticket. In which case someone with 1000 hashes would have 6.9 tickets, but someone with 100 would have 4.6 tickets. Even though the big rig has 1000% more hashes it only has a 60% chance of winning. That means it loses it's economies of scale advantage. So more smaller miners will enter instead of a few big ones.
Those are just my thoughts though, I am not an expert, although I am interested enough that I think I get it.

It is extra security. The private keys are on the wallet, so they cannot be stolen from your computer or by hacking. To send BTC you will have to confirm with the device so no one can move them without physically having the device, and knowing your password.

What wallet should you use? It does not really matter. The only thing I can think to look into is if his wallet uses legacy or Segwit adresses. If his wallet supports both it should not matter. If he is new to crypto try to help him pick out one that does both.
However the Bitcoin is always stored on the block chain not the wallet so the wallet itself does not matter too much. 
Personally I might gift a hardware wallet as part of the package. Something like a Tezor or ledger, that adds security and kills two birds with one stone (assuming he does not have one.

If half of all BTC is lost than prices will be cut in half. If you hold 1 BTC you will be able to buy twice as much with it but no new money was created. basically the guy who lost it (or died) gave everyone holding Bitcoin a tiny bit of his wealth.
If he had 1 million dollars in BTC and dies without giving out his private keys, that 1 million dollars is divided among all holders of BTC as a percentage of total supply they own. So if had half of all BTC than I would get 5000k when he dies.
The price of Bitcoin should rise as there are fewer of them. If the market value of all circulating Bitcoin is constant taking money out of circulation will raise the value of what is left, until the overall value of the market is the same.

"actual" economist here.
Yes this graph is showing inflation/deflation. Adjusting for inflation would make the line flat.
The point is that someone holding $1 since 1913 would now only be able to purchase something worth 5 cents. 95% of the value of the dollar was absorbed by the bankers who printed the money. Effectively they spent other peoples money. 
It is still arguable that inflation does not fully account for the quality of goods. \\A record player is not as good as an Ipod but would cost the same in there time period. But the point is if there was not inflation that person keeping a dollar would be able to buy even more things today

There are two things he could be working with, exchanges and wallets.
1.  exchanges let you buy and trade crypto
2. wallets store crypto
If they are exchanges go to his history. There it will tell you what withdraws were made. That will give you a list of withdraw addresses. 
You can then check those address to see if there is still money in them.  Search for block explorer and type those withdraw addresses. They will look like a long string of random numbers like this 
Further check if he used any other crypto currencies, there are thousands that are not Bitcoin. If those accounts have withdraws for other types it should say. And you should check
If you find funds take your time getting them back. You will need to ask a lot of questions. Check if his computer has any wallets by searching for wallet, bitcoin, crypto or whatever. Hopefully he used a wallet stored on the computer of phone. If not a web wallet will be hard to find unless he left notes on which accounts he had
Many wallets have a recovery phrase. With 12 words you can recreate the wallet. Is there anyplace he could have safely stored these on paper? That is standard procedure. This may be in a lock bock, or storage. He could have also bought a hardware wallet that will look like a USB drive

In a way they try to not ti account for it. If the basket once included a flip phone, and consumers stop buying them they are replaced with a smart phone in the basket. If they did not do this the market would show huge deflation. The flip phone price would drop by say 99% so if it accounted for 3% of the basket there would a 3% decreases in "price levels" showing deflation. As I am not an expert in inflation calculation I may be missing some fancy method they try, but from my understanding they explicitly try to avoid including technological innovation in inflation. 
You can look up price deflators, if you are interested in the second method. The idea is that the "basket" should be weighted by what people spend money on across the whole economy.
If GDP was 11 trillion this year, but if you replaced current prices for all goods with last years prices GDP would be 10 trillion than inflation is 10%. The price deflator would be 1.1. This means that inflation is weighted by how much people spend on specific goods. So if 20% of income is spent on gas, than gas prices would be weighted by 20% in the overall calculation. Essentially you are multiplying the price change of each goods by the percent that good added to GDP, and then adding up all goods.

Mining difficulty increases **because** prices rise. Price goes up more people can mine at a profit
Increasing mining difficulty does not increase price. If my computer starts mining that does not change demand for Bitcoin but difficulty increases. 
The supply curve of Bitcoin is fixed and the difficulty to mine a Bitcoin mirrors the demand. However the price of Bitcoin is only related to the demand.
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:56:25
They have trouble with this, so no.
There are two ways they calculate inflation. The most common method is to have a "basket" of goods and track the prices of the goods in those baskets. The basket is selected based on what consumers purchase, but can change over time. In that case it is not accounted for.
In fact there is no way to account for it (I am an Austrian so we like to point these things out) there is no mathematical way to say how much better an Ipod is than a CD player. Since value is subjective we cannot use math to say how much better one thing is over another in a abstract sense. This makes the very concept of inflation suspect. I for one prefer listing the rise in circulating money rather than looking at price levels, as a benchmark that is objective.
The second method uses a GDP deflator, this takes the GDP this year and divides it by what the GDP would be if prices from last year were used. This however still cannot account for new or improved products.
While inflation is listed at 2-3% it is probably more like 7-10% in my view. Absent printing money prices would decrease, and quality would improve, so using a baseline of constant prices understates how much the FED has affected price levels.

In the short run the hash rate will decrease. You are paid both the mining fess and the block reward. When the mining rewards are done, than all that is left is the fees.
There is no reason for these fees to increase, as they are bid by users looking to get a transaction on the block. They do not care about the hash rate used to get the block so there bids stay the same.
This means at the switch, the reward for mining will decrease. This in turn means some mining operational that were profitable are now sub-economic and shut off. However if the price of bitcoin rises due to demand, or transactions become more needed than the mining reward will increase and they will come online.
 This is no different than when the block rate gets cut now. The first blocks gave out 50 BTC in mining rewards, which was halved to 25, and is now 12.5. That change is the same as what will happen when we go from  say 1 BTC to zero. 
This will reduce the network security but whether it is a problem or not depends on other factors. It was not a problem in the past when the reward was cut, but that is not to say at some point we should not be worried. One would hope that the fee is enough or that a change to the code will be made if it becomes clear a 51% attack is possible

Cryptography is more precisely what Bitcoin uses but digital signatures are  created with a encryption process.   I found that digging into how encryption works clarified the process for me better than when I tried to understand cryptography.

In the long run you should not need to panic sell. If the price did go to 100k over night I would sell some expecting it to just be a short term bubble, but I hold some no matter what to spend when I am older. If it is 100k in 25 years I would not worry about a dip.

Governments can take wealth through inflation. That is a hidden tax on consumers. Imagine the state doubles the money supply. Prices double. If you own a dollar it is now worth only 50 cents. Where did the other 50 cents go? The state that printed the money can now spend and it's value is also 50 cents. They were able to take 50% of all the wealth just by printing money. 
If they ban crypto they can regain more power to tax the people. This is why I support crypto and also why a state would want to ban it
Another reason is that they lose control of transactions. Bitcoin is public so it is hard to hide your transactions. However no one can stop you from transacting.
Today the government could use banks to ban people they dislike such as protesters or rebels. Bitcoin protects these anti-government groups by giving them a way to transact without needing permission from anyone including the government or banks

Thanks for the added information. I did backwards engineer some of my understanding of Bitcoin through figuring out RSA encryption which certainly led to confusion. 
Do you need to be able to backwards engineer a message for it to be considered encryption? 
When I look at where my computer stores passwords I can see the hashed values.  I have at least heard people call that the encrypted password, but you cannot reverse engineer the plain text password from the hashed values. 
In my mind the public key private key pairs are parallel to this. The non-reversible public key is a hash of the private key.

In any investment never put in more than you can afford to lose. Whether that be stocks or crypto. Also one should not put all of eggs in one basket.
If you diversify your investments and keep only enough Bitcoin that you are comfortable losing in the short term, than I doubt you will have health problems. For some people that may be most of there life savings, for others only a few dollars. You can either work on being less worried about the present , or you can change your investment strategy and sell some Bitcoin
I have a lot in Bitcoin so I want it to go up, but  it is a long term investment so I have no stress. A dip means I can buy more. I also do not own so much that I would not be able to eat if it went to zero. I think those are good rules to follow

Not that I am aware of. You could use an API in a exchange to automate the effect
So Coinbase is set to buy some amount of Bitcoin each month, which is a built in feature. Then you get an API from coinbase and program it to send a specific Bitcoin amount to a specific address at a specific time. 
Another option is to load a Bitcoin wallet and sign transactions  for the future. I have not done this but my understanding is that the lightning network works on this principle.

This link is dead for me.
Also is that a problem then? you can now see and spend the Bitcoin from the Mycelium wallet, or am I mistaken?

The HODLR Idea is that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency. If you get in early you will get massive gains. In 30 years if Bitcoin is accepted like cash you do not even need to sell, you just buy what you want with it.
Bitcoin Mooned to 20k because  of speculation in a bubble. There would not be a bitcoin crash if it mooned because it actually became the dominate money or store of value. So no in that case there would not be a big pull out of Bitcoin, the use of it is what drove the price up not it's speculation.

True but you can check a couple hops to see. If they use a mixing service you cannot really know.
@_date: 2019-12-11 02:29:35
Thanks. I appreciate the info
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:54:45


True it is a mining fee but a mining fee is a form of a transaction fee
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:20:40
You need to define "best". There are trad-offs to any wallet. Without knowing your goals I cannot tell you what is best
* If you want to store Bitcoin securely for a long time a cold storage solution is best
* If you want ease of use for many purchases a phone wallet is best
* If you want secure transactions and low fees a full node wallet is best
* If you want private transactions a mixer wallet is best

No problem hope that helps. I find it very interesting but it was confusing at first.
It is fun to figure out each step if you are a curious person. Of course one can use Bitcoin without knowing any of this, but I think it is useful to understand.
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:18:29
You can easily check.
Just view the coinbase transactions and see what is left in the wallet. For pools you have to check at least two hops because the users will be sent newly mind coins/
Here is a miner address I found
They have received 4864,338 Bitcoin and sent 4863,968. Meaning they HODL 369 BTC. My guess is most miners keep a portion and sell most, they need a revenue stream now but want some upside.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:07:16
No problem

There are many videos on this you should check out. Simple explanation
1. Private keys are used to generate public keys
2. Bitcoin is stored in public keys
3. If you can sign transaction with your private key it can be shown you own the public key
4. You send a signal to the network to move Bitcoin from your public key to another public key, signing the request with your private key
5. Miners verify that you are the owner, and add you to block. They can see the message was signed with the same private key that created the public key that currently has the BTC. 
6. Once other people verify the miners  block meets the rules of bitcoin the block is validated. These rules include that only the owner of the private key can move the BTC in the public adress.
7. After enough validations of a block people will trust the Bitcoin has changed addresses by the owner of the private key.
It would be good to look up encryption in general to understand the process. This is the same way passwords are verified on computers without being able to see what the password is
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:28:29
It depends but typically yes if you put in the effort to understand bitcoin.
Currently the transaction fee for Bitcoin is about 25 cents. This means any amount of money you send whether 1 million dollars or 10 cents will cost 25 cents to send. If the Western union fee is higher than this than it is cheaper to use Bitcoin. However if you are sending $1 it is probably not worth it, bitcoin is excellent at sending large amounts to anyone
Bitcoin has no borders so you can send it to anyone. you can even cross all boarders with millions of dollars and not have any taxes or risk of theft, it just exists on the internet. That makes it great for international exchange
If you need to transfer the Bitcoin into the national fiat the ease of this depends on the country. You can use peer to peer exchange, you can use  Bitcoin ATM. You could also set up a trading account and redeem stable coins. For example there are crypto currencies that can be redeemed for a British poind that are traded on online exchanges. Simple trade the Bitcoin for that currency then set up a bank account with the issuing company and redeem them.
If you are unsure about the process however I would just use Western union. It is not worth the stress, and bitcoin will not come back to you if you send it to the wrong address.

I would sell some and buy the dip. We really do not know what will come in the short run. If you are comfortable with the risk  of losing out on Bitcoin gains sell some, if you are comfortable with the risk of short term bitcoin loses than hold. IMO
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:57:54
No problem I was confused about it in the past.
Actually that recovery password works without the ledger software. You plug the 23 words into a algorithm and it spits out the private keys. That is why anyone could steal your Bitcoin id they have that 23 word recovery phrase. The ledger software has the algorithm built in to recover a wallet, but I could use the same recovery phrase in most modern wallets. 
Here is a article explain how that works. I could be a bit off as I am not an encryption expert. [
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:21:59


In most wallets yes. There is a setting for what level of fee you want. Low fee means it happens slower, high fees are quick but cost more.
You can input the amount you want to send and the wallet will take out that amount minus the fee. Only the sender pays the fee
On an exchange no bitcoin is actually moved. They store all the Bitcoin and only move it when you withdraw, they just move credit around to different users to keep down fees. The buyer and seller both pay a % fee to the exchange.  When you withdraw the bitcoin you have credit for you pay a network fee to miners.

If you see the transaction on the block explorer link I sent but it does not show up in the wallet. Than the wallet is probably not able to check the block chain because of a internet issue. 
All the wallet is doing is checking the block explorer for addresses it knows you own. That is the same as looking at the website I gave you. Assuming it showed up on the block chain you have nothing to worry about you still have the Bitcoin. The bitcoin is stored on the the block chain and not the wallet, the wallet just saves your passwords and acts as a easy way to look at the block chain. In such a case try restarting the app, if the issue continues there should be a way to export the private keys. Hopefully you have a 24 word recovery phrase. You can create a new wallet and start it from those 24 words, after doing that the new wallet will see all of the Bitcoin in the old wallet.
If you are unsure you can DM me the public address of the receiving wallet transaction, and I can check that it is a receiving wallet issue.

Lets do some very rough math
It is estimated that 4 million BTC have been lost. That is about 25% of available supply over a 10 year period, it is more complicated but say we lose 25% of 21 million BTC
The effective market cap of Bitcoin would need to be 1.5 Trillion dollars. You can deflate another 10% from inflation to be 1.4 Trillion.
That is more than every physical dollar put together, it is 60% of all M1 which includes travelers checks liquid investments. Or it is about 12% of all M2 money which includes non liquid assets. 
Over the next 5 years I find that unlikely. I own a good chunk of BTC so I am not hating, but you need to be realistic. There are good returns to be made but hang in for a longer time period than 5 years
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:42:00
Can you provide the public address that you are sending the bitcoin from? 
You should paste the address [here]( and see what transactions occurred on the block chain. When you say it is the "same" do you mean nothing was moved from the address on the block chain?
 If that is the case then the first wallet still has your Bitcoin. Just import the private keys into a new wallet and then try to spend it again.
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:36:43
A few ideas come to mind.
1. The mining fee is too low and the transaction is stranded
2. you downloaded a phishing wallet that stole the Bitcoin when sent
3. The wallet is out of date and is syncing the blocks before you sent the money
4. There is a glitch in the transaction history making it read the wrong number
I would check the public address you sent it from, see if the transaction is on block explorer, or in the meme pool. If it is in the meme pool than you can increase the mining fee and double spend in order to strand the first transaction. If it went to the wrong address you got phished. If it is no where to be found the wallet did not send the transaction and you can reload your private keys and try again.

Peer to peer is about the only way. They could use a Bitcoin ATM. Banks need to wait to allow withdraw for legal reasons. What I do is have a slush fund in coinbase. I can get 1.2% API for holding dollars. Then I have the option to withdraw any BTC I buy instantly. After that I refill the slush fund.

Many companies will "accept" Bitcoin. When there is an automated system to convert to USD there is no cost or risk to them.
They are happy to have customers pay in BTC so long as they get USD. That just adds to the customer base. This is just like a credit card. They will accept it even though they are being paid by another company. 
You may not pay the credit card company for a week, but the store is paid now by the credit card company. In this case you may pay in BTC but the exchange pays them in USD.

Never. I will starve to death before spending one Sat. He who dies with the most Sats wins. The point of any currency is to never use it and pile up more.  Good luck and HODL on
The truthful answer is when I want to spend the money more than having the Bitcoin. At some point in my life I will  want to repair my car, go on vaction etc.
It has more to do with what will change in my life than how Bitcoin will change. It is a good hold and I do not need much now so I will HODL for the foreseeable future.

This is more of a personal question.What I would ask myself is.
-If I were debt free would I take out a loan to buy Bitcoin?
That is really no different than taking out a loan while you are in debt. I would not do this but that is up to you. I happen to be very anti-debt but I recognize other people have different values.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:16:14
I think it will be worth one Bitcoin within the next 5 years
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:50:47
Interesting , thanks for writing this. I have a couple questions:
1. When you do a statistical adjustment for age, how does the relative wealth level and martial status stack up?
2. Is the claim that investors are uninformed come only from anticodtes. I would argue most crypto investors are actually well versed in economic theory compared to the general population. Certainly there are bad investors in the stock market
3. When did most current investors first buy crypto? I would be interested in seeing the skew between early adopters and recent ones. If older ones are more informed, younger/older etc
4. How frequently do users buy crypto. For example do we usually buy some each pay check, buy once a year or only one time
5. What is the average number of cryptos owned by the average investor. How many do they own now (ETH, BTC , NANO) and how many have they owned over the last year (indicating frequent trading if this number is high)
Thanks again

People being dumb is not in any way related to Bitcoin.
* Yes BTC has been used for illegal activities, so has the untraceable USD.
* Yes people have been scammed to steal Bitcoin, they have also been scammed out of USD
* Yes people have taken out loans to invest in BTC. They have also taken out loans to invest in real estate and stocks
If it does hurt BTC's image it is because people lack critical thinking skills.
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:15:59
Me too. I have "risky" investments like Bitcoin but not more than I can afford. I have no debt so even if Bitcoin goes to zero I will not be a slave to someone else I need to pay.
If the stock market crashes and BTC goes to zero I can still feed myself.
@_date: 2019-09-22 22:14:28
This of course is a major value to Bitcoin. It was built out of the failure of Egold and other similar projects. 
The creators of BTC saw that any digital currency that can be shut down will be regulated out of existence once it threatens the power in control of the fiat money supply. Just look a Libre, it needed permission to get started and did not get it.
While it will suck **when** Bitcoin gets more regulations, we have built a robust network. We do not need permission to use Bitcoin. I would count on these regulations to come, even if there were no idiots in the BTC market once it hits 100k or overtakes USD it will have massive push back from regulators. Whether that comes now or later is not too much of a problem
