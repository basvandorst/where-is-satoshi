Is r/bitcoin the final say in the units that people who use bitcoin will use?  Seems like people should use what they want and what people like will win out in the end.

I for one am spending my Bitcoins and I think most retailers convert them to cash immediately. Sometimes I don't buy back as many as I spend. I really think coin base or someone needs to add a auto buyback feature.

Actually it was used in two episodes and in the second episode they equated the Bitcoin value to USD.    Edit: also, the person who owned the second one was not a criminal just a victim.

A simple explanation since i dont have time right now for a detailed on. I am, as far as libertatians are concerned, a statist. I believe strongly in civil liberties, but i think that government has a role in certain areas. I am also anti "big business" more complicated than that, but for ease of explaining I'll go with that. I also think that the entire banking system is horribly corrupt. I am very anti corruption. I believe in what was the founding ideas of the progressive movement to end corruption.   I see Bitcoin as an amazing technology and the future of money. The idea of bitcoins can destroy corruption if taken by the state. Imagine the transparency you could have in government if you could watch the money flow through it.   I also think that a bitcoin type system could make a ubi possible. Things like every transaction could have a small fee that pays for the ubi.  This would mean foreigners would help pay for the ubi.   A monetary supply that changes with the population size.   The idea of bitcoin makes a lot of things possible but since they don't exist yet, Go Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:30:03
If the government cut off the internet/power wouldn't that have made Bitcoin a weakness?  You now have no way to use your money. At least cash you can put in a safe. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:08:38
I disagree with the libertarian view on taxes, and therefore I disagree with points 1 &amp; 3. I believe in the existence of the state, but with limited specific goals. Defense(and I mean defense not the best defense is a good offense), protecting rights of individuals, and scientific research. I think economic freedom grants the ultimate in individual freedom and only the ubi can achieve this. The use of my ideal currency automatically has a built in transaction fee/tax. Therefore you cannot avoid paying it and no use of force will ever be needed.

If there is one thing I learned from politics is that peoples attention span e short and this will be mostly forgotten in a few weeks.   Bitcoin will be a term they remember in a negative way but will remember and without much reason can be swayed back.

I think people are spending them faster than they are being bought. Everyday there is another company accepting them and those companies are quickly selling them. So maybe growth = price drop

I was giving a suggestion that I use for a passphrase. I am not familiar with electrums see process so i dont know about altered words.  I just figured if my method was ubsecure that would be a nice small change that would make it orders of magnitude harder to crack but still easy to remember.
Even if I don't alter a word I still find it highly unlikely that it could be cracked. I just don't see how the first 12 words from an obscure book is easy to crack. If I'm wrong then I have at least one password to change. I see how it could be cracked if I used 1984, but not something less obvious.   Please let me know how it would work and I will change that password tonight.

I was telling someone about bitcoin yesterday and said that "you know what will be the determining factor for bitcoin?" Porn.  It decided vhs and it will decide bitcoin. No one (well a lot of people anyway) wants to have a credit card charge to a porn site and bitcoin will be perfect.  If the internet is for porn so are bitcoins.

These graphs look highly suspect. The two methods are literally the same graph just plotted with a different x value. If he was using the old method he would have been getting a totally different looking graph as it would have different data.

Maybe PayPal can be the company that makes bitcoin easy to use for everyone; with a small fee of course. They could even be a mediator for small businesses and customers over complaints (some companies maybe use this to lore in customers) by holding payments for a few days.

They should factor viewing comments into the score. Like it is half a vote when you don't.

You could definitely handle 10% of all B2C transactions with the current value of BTC, assuming that the rate at which those who spend the currency is fast enough to not cause the price to rise.      
If I gave you a dollar and then you gave that dollar to a friend and he gave it to another friend then $3 in payments were made with a single dollar.

The market cap of twitter is expected to be $13 billion and isn't even profitable. People are betting on its future. If you ask me there is more potential in bitcoin and why I think it is still undervalued.

After reviewing the numbers of the report I agree. Plus we do not know how many Bitcoins actually exist(not lost). I just think that its hard to know how quickly they will move through the economy until they are used, and it is possible that a low value could still be used in a lot of transactions since bit coin can move very quickly from person to person.

Well it could just be the currency that is used for nonessential products. Take star trek (I know it is fiction) they did not need money so one could assume all their needs were met by replicators but there were still credits people used to buy luxury items.

If people decided to stop using twitter tomorrow their assets would not even pay the debt they owe.  Your stocks would become worthless.  Bitcoin could be worthless tomorrow just like twitter.  Both companies values to the investor is based entirely on the public using it.  Unlike companies such as Boeing which have assets exceeding their liabilities.   Yet there isn't the same criticism for a company like twitter to have such a huge growth rate.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:04:22
I agree 100%. I tell everyone that I tell about bitcoin that there is a chance tomorrow it will be worth nothing, and you should buy knowing this. (I usually focus on getting people to use bitcoins to buy things or to transfer money to other countries)   
I wrote this because I feel that there is little difference between investing in companies like twitter and bitcoin vs investing in established companies like Coke or Boeing.  However, I never see the amount of attacks on startups value as I see on bitcoins. Especially on companies, such as twitter, that have no physical assets if things go bad.
