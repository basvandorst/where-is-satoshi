Just got it :)

Thanks :)
Everything is off chain until the transaction is complete. So when you run out of money or you're done using the internet it gets posted to the block chain. 
Yes. There's a local wallet that you can transfer money to and from that funds the transactions.

We could definitely implement this. The feature would have to be off by default though. Privacy is a main concern.

There are grace periods and anti-abuse provisions built into selling "micro-time". These are pretty fun to develop.

Thanks for the support. There's been a lot of obstacles getting to this point.
I'll have to think about this one. The client nodes would need to know their connections are being tracked as well. Anonymity and privacy are core values at BitMesh. We shy away from tracking / logging features but I understand the use case for accountability.

The demo will be a video showing bitmesh working with micropayments. Not a software release just yet

Thanks for posting. We're looking for feedback and would love to hear initial thoughts.

Haha never looked at it from that perspective... When I think of IoT, I think of refrigerators buying milk for themselves when they run out ;)
According to wikipedia: "..."things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices." I'm not sure we fit the bill  since we are harnessing present connectivity and NICs to communicate with one another. More like an abstraction layer that provides additional value rather than manufactured with the intent to do so.

Micro-payment channels are aggregated off blockchain until the peers are done transacting.

5 seconds was just for the demo. When we release, the time / payment option will be negotiated by the buyer and seller

Data does originate from the provider or providers (depending on the mesh situation). I'm not sure how coffee shops or any other open public access points deal with this but you mitigate risk by routing traffic through a VPN. 
Maybe we could set up a BitMesh VPN service later on or build in another service provider. The only problem is a potential for a central point of failure in that sort of model.

Yo Ryan, check out  - we are already accepted into Boost VC and are working on a similar idea ;)
