The only place I use BTC to buy something is because I get a discount for using it which is this: when I buy CBD oil online, that particular company that I buy it from gives me a 20% discount for buying it in BTC. 
BTC is currently more of store of value or an investment opportunity than a payment system at present, at least for people living in developed countries.

Do you get a discount? I live in AZ and buy CDB oil online and I get a 20% discount for buying with btc.

Convenience and speed will cost you higher transaction fees and/or give less favorable conversion rates. As you are intending a long term investment, you could opt for a slower method with lower fees. Going through your bank will take longer but will be a better buy.

Your bitcoin is not actually inside your wallet. Your bitcoin exists as transaction(s) in the distributed ledger (blockchain) that is the bitcoin network. It might help to think of the wallet as more like a keychain. You hold the key(s) that unlock the transactions in the distributed ledger so that you can send your coin  to an address in a transaction.

My understanding is an increase in difficulty can mean miners are more likely to need to immediately sell a higher percentage of their reward to cover operating expenses instead of hodling. This puts more btc on the market. Don't know if 2% would make a difference, but good to be aware of. Thanks for posting this,

Having tried trading, I can say it is harder than it looks. I experienced impatience, fear and greed. It is easy to let emotions cloud rational analysis and action.

I am on a Mac. I bought my first bitcoin (20 bucks worth) through Coinstar/Coinme back in April. I had a difficult time doing the photographs for the KYC on the website at home to redeem what I bought at the Kiosk. The photos dialog box just wouldn't come up.  I had to call customer service and the guy told me it was a known issue for the Mac and we managed a work-around but it was a big hassle. I don't know if they fixed it by now. I didn't care so much about he exchange rate for such a small amount. I would suggest that you try a small amount first and get familiar with how it all works.

When explorers display btc transferred in a tx or a block, are they just adding up all the values of the inputs and outputs (and calculating the mining fees), knowing that in most tx's some of the outputs are going back to the same 'owner'  as 'change'. I know that change outputs are often disguised for security reasons. Is there a reliable way to determine what part of a tx is 'change'?

I have been using BLOCKCYPHER which has limitation but it is free. It has good documentation. The downside is limited calls per second and it will only retrieve 20 block transactions per call. Also I couldn't get the event handler to work for new transactions in the mempool or new blocks, etc.

Thanks for your detailed reply. I am working on an infographic style blockchain explorer with animations to be run in a browser. It crossed my mind to put the data in SQL. I thought it might be slower to do it that way, but I can see there would be a lot of advantages for my project. So far I have been using an API by BLOCKCYPHER and now mainly working on the animation part with some static data. I just spun up my own node a few weeks ago and my next hurdle will be to RPC my own node instead of using BLOCKCYPHER. I will certainly take a look at what you have done with SQL. I do have a 1 Tb SSD.

Each transaction contains a script (a program in the bitcoin scripting language). The operations available in the scripting language are narrowly focussed on bitcoin and how it works. You could for example have a transaction that requires the use of two out of three different private keys  to spend the bitcoin and distribute the keys among people in your organization as a security measure (so that no single key holder can spend the bitcoin in secret). There are other scripts that only make the bitcoin spendable after a certain amount of time has elapsed. There are other things you can do with the scripts, these are some that are commonly used.

I also have a ledger. After your wallet creates the transaction to receive the coin from your exchange, it will show a link to view your transactions on a blockchain explorer website. There you can see what your transaction looks like in the bitcoin network. You can see what block your transaction gets included in and how many blocks have been mined on top of it. It helps to see what is going on in the network as you wait for your transaction to complete.

I FOMO'd at the end of June. Went through some sadness and frustration. So disappointing. In the meantime, I was thinking more and more that I want to HODL. I made a commitment to HODL what I bought at the top for at least 12 months.  It doesn't bother me anymore. The price doesn't matter when you think in terms of years. The price DOES matter when you leverage 8x. Do you really need that kind of stress? I know I don't.
