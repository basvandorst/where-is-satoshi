"Its an altcoin forking off"...Thats not how that works, or what that means.

This is literally the perfect example of everyday joes waiting to get into bitcoin from traditional exchanges. They want the exposure of an ETF because its all over the news and yes they could just buy some but that would mean learning how it actually works...GBTC to the uninitiated penny stock trader is a unicorn.

Gold star for a reasonable logical deduction

One doesnt simply see the bottom nor the top.

"I dont know anything more than anybody else." Are you assuming others dont know more than you?

CREDIT THE FUCKING ARTIST. Covering the eyes with letters doesnt make this yours...
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:28:19
Lmao if its soooo easy to call it why are you so proud of your guess? Btw LOTS of people called the top and the correction. I personally have been too but im not here bragging :P
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:41:36
What i said is true because its based off factual events and observations. I gave you facts and you gave me "maybe thats true" lol 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:30:38
Banks do more than process transactions. Loans, IRAs,CDs,Bonds, Bill payments, etc. Your BTC wallet isn't even close to the functionality a bank provides. Js.

You know theres an interesting theory that bubbles dont technically exist.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:59:27
Dude...wtf are you smoking 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:39:35
No it didn't. Trust me, I was a miner for both. Eth classic had and still has no actual development.

Whoops i was replying to the wrong comment (my apologies). This was my response above to NoCal
"He's right, all cloud mining contracts are inherently unprofitable if not scams. To put it simply, your contract is for X hashes × Y time resulting in ~Z Bitcoin(s) at the **current network hashrate**. Thats easy to understand. But noobs usually dont realize that the network hashrate **almost contantly rises** which means over time you see less and less profit. Which again almost always means buying a coin is more profitable than "cloud mining". I could explain further, things like if price of BTC rises (which you expect it to if your buying a contract) Hashrate will rise as well, and other factors but i gotta go to work. This should do."

Also has the most users...hmm could be connected?
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:29:45
Exactly.  A+
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:16:52
I dont know how many times i have to say it. "Coinbase is complete **shit**" , they always have "technical issues" during major price drops, their customer support is a complete joke, and they like to disable or close user accounts for seemingly no reason. They closed my account of six months for  bank chargeback, which wasnt my fault and i promptly paid them back for. Just use gemini instead, support actually responds (which ys know, is nice when your money is on the line)
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:44:38
Im sorry does SEGWIT2X enable enhanced programmability? Until then Ethereum is here to stay, i mean to say smart contracts on Ethereum have been getting better and better over time. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:49:08
Clearly the entire Ethereum protocol was single-handedly developed by one person.

And the crowd goes **WILD!!!**
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:44:18
Until you can pay your taxes solely in BTC we will always need an exchange. P2P just doesnt cut it everywhere. For example their are only 2 BTC merchants in my city of 250k, and both are sketchy af.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:03:02
If markets were rational we wouldn't be here.

Lmao, Coinbase is a joke. Freezing accounts and monitoring users is inherently anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:47:57
Lmao, thats cute.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:58:16
Right, because OP can definitely pay taxes in BTC, no fiat necessary, also Visa converts back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:45:36
Idt thats how this work lol "There's no free lunch" +the fork is priced in.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:22:37
Actual scientist here just thought I'd chime in... The science is definitely on our side, thats why we march. You think lab nerds would protest (publicly and online) if we had **any other choice?** Humans are naturally idiots, stop being an idiot.
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:35:08
Who do u think made Tor??
"...Tor was not only developed for a time in the early 2000s by individuals who "were on contract from DARPA and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory", but since its inception the bulk of its funding has come from the federal government of the United States.[18]" - courtesy of Wikipedia. Your welcome.

Yes, cloud mining is a ponzi. In other news water is wet.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:01:06
People are idiots. This sub is full of idiots who think they are being clever.

I'm not...generalization is an asinine way to view the world.

Bad timing...
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:09:23
I hate to break this to you but its a ponzi, a long running one but a ponzi nonetheless. He has been paid from new users funds. Ponzis are great until they end lol and who the fuck reinvest their earnings into a ponzi. So much wrong so little time

Lmao this is why I always do a background check before sparring with trolls.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:38:10
Another one that grinds my gears is the : You can just make a cryptocurrency, so bitcoin isnt special.
Yes there are thousands of cryptos but only two stable multibillion dollar ones...
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:47:56
They are the ONLY unit of account? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:34:19
IMHO people are over-reacting about the hard fork, the platform the greater development will be the main chain and within 6-12 months everything will be close to normal. Using the closest example: within minutes of Ethereums hard fork people knew which one they want to use and both sides still exist and somehow grew.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:56:59
That's a fact.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:10:37
You just made my point for why it isnt a good store of value. Good stores of value should neither GROW or DROP by any large percentage over a short period of time. Imagine taking a 6 month bitcoin loan for $30000 and finding out you actually have to pay $60000 because its price when up. But i suppose some just wont understand...
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:04:18
"so people have to pay for each day of mining rewards. the higher the price, the more that needs to be injected each day." ...You do know they pay for those mining rewards with **electricity** right?
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:03:26
I second that motion. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:54:04
Irrelevant to by he topic. Also chill tf out about scaling. Its literally on its way. This thread in no way lead to your random rant on blocksize...
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:15:58
A store of value doesnt have to perfectly maintain its value, it just has to have a small/predictable rate of change. Notice you can tell exactly how much a dollar has dropped in a year, its predictable. Your loans denominated in dollars will have the same value +/- 1-3%
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:16:02
I disagree with most of what the author says, ESPECIALLY the "Fan responses", but the author has one very good point. This claim that BTC or any crypto is a "store of value" is at present completely false. Something cannot both be a store of value and drop 20% in a day. I love Bitcoin, i really do but it is not and has not ever been a good store of value..
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:49:01
Amen lol
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:55:07
Lmfao i find myself constantly thinking that.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:54:20
Thanks for the reply, i agree that people have different definitions but the textbook definition is the one that matters most and the term "Store of Value" has a specific definition thus the audience would be wrong. "A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be PREDICTABLY useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future." Taken further a "good" store of value is something that will have very little volatility going forward hence why i emphasized the predictable nature.
You need to know that you can buy ~100 eggs next year, not 100 +/- 40%.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:59:13
Loan denominated in BTC are just not likely to ever really be a thing..
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:58:27
Its literally backed by electricity cost. That is a valid "anything"
