Just looking at your posts it's pretty obvious you're just trying to get attention for your failing blog or whatever and I see you've already posted it over at B1TC01N ¢4$H and I'm sure that'll get their dicks hard for the 400th time hearing this even tho it will NEVER happen
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:54:40
Are you sure coinbase doesn't work?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:16
Don't sell now it's currently dipping but that dip will be over shortly it currently would be around $6,000 for one whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:17:43
People will hodl unless they're weak hearted and if that's the cash the alt coins can have em
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:40:52
GENTLEMEN LETS NOT REMOVE TRADITION FOR ITS ALL WE HAVE, ITS 'HODL' AND 'HODLING'
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:28:09
The same way any form of currency/stock does, the people's belief in that currency or stock, the dollar or pound for example could fail tomorrow all because everyone losses hope in it but it's the same way with bitcoin only it's only had exponential growth in the past and with past growth gives people more of a reason to support it giving it substantial growth but it still isn't backed but any government also making it semi-decentralized still.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:25
Hey man profit is profit
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:04:20
Venezuela is in the middle of a financial crisis bitcoin is allowing them to have a stable currency when they don't have one currently due to the socialism in the state.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:58:52
It helps speed up the network allowing it to process more transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:57:05
I would also like to point out how after every dip there's a Big increase.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:09:58
I think he is referencing bitcoin (gold)
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:54:13
Thank you seems like you're one of 3 people who gets that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:43:46
Okay don't quote me here but from what I know I believe hashing power has todo with mining and finding block whilst nodes help speed up the network allowing transactions to occur easier.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:34
It's off a forum where a drunk guy spelled it wrong and we've kept it since.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:19:17
Bitcoin is the currency of everyone knows so if it fails cryptos in general fail.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:50:00
It'll gradually get better it won't be like a flip of the switch miners will need to switch back over burn you should begin to turn a profit if you bought yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:01:24
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:53:34
Anything is possible but I feel like with this recent rise bitcoin has established itself and it's more or less gonna be on how much faith people truly have in it as a currency like if you look at paper money as just paper it's worthless and it'd he corrected to be worth $0 but no one can truly tell the future it's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:16:43
I would concur.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:17:24
I'm not saying it's bad man good on you just people around here get irritated when talking about other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:28:13
I don't think we should be worrying the community with these posts but you are entitled to your right to speak your mind but man I don't know how long you've been invested in bitcoin but these things happen all the time bitcoin will rebound, I would understand more if bitcoin were like $100 per bitcoin but it's not it's still over $6,000 per one bitcoin it's not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:27:32
No one can tell the future all you can do is invest and hope
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:54:45
Yea I concur I appreciate people like you on Reddit who can have civilized discussions like this I've been in it all too many times where people are just annoying assholes but yea you make some very good points.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:21:11
That 20% would probably be added right back on by transaction fees LMAO
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:26:47
I say make a shirt that looks like this picture except make outline the coins in white and put the bitcoin symbol on it so it comes off a cartoony but slick[coinshirt idea]( 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:49:50
It's because of high activity I believe it should go down later
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:09:24
Hey man your the one who sounds crazy hit me up in a month and tell me that bitcoin is still doing bad and we will see who's wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:24:49
They do it so people do purposefully advert another crypto because that would just hurt the bitcoin community, if you wish to talk about other cryptos goto their subreddits or goto r/cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:00:58
Dude honestly we got Christmas early because when people like that sell off their coins we not only get a more reliable community but we also get more coins!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:58:11
I personally believe bitcoin would flourish in that situation as it is independent from any governing body it stands strong by itself and most likely as things like bank runs would occur people would possibly stop trusting banks and start trusting bitcoin to keep their money secure even though its just as much a gamble I believe it would more heavily legitimize bitcoin on the international stage as a currency and I believe the price of bitcoin would definitely spike. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:27:46
A single Venezuelan dollar equals $.090 so it's pretty bad.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:54:13
Possibly 5k so I mean the chances are there man.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:44:13
Then what do nodes do?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:02:45
It will never happen I'm sorry to tell ya. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:30:41
Nodes help speed up the network, the reason transactions got blocked up in the first place was because of such slow networks then those contribute to the end all build up.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:41:20
that's pretty decent from other stories I've headd
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:19:11
It's all speculation but I'd like to believe since its independent from a true government that it would prosper due to the fact that people would lose faith in let's say the dollar then people begin to put more faith into bitcoin and more businesses could turn to accepting bitcoin as a true currency.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:26:38
Yea it gets pretty bad
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:45:26
The community and people who are putting up nodes to help smooth out the process rather than some of the people who are just complaining not really helping much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:29:28
Hey man it's all hypothetical he asked us to be the devils advocate not the crusaders of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:13:30
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:52:39
Bitcoin itself will grow but the fees are due to high activity
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:57:31
Yea and it's also possible a black hole appears tomorrow and kills us all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:00:19
2 for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:21:59
Recently since its gotten to $7000
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:20:15
It's yours kid don't listen to anyone else they just want ur money and you aren't entitled to give them anything.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:09:28
bitcoin (gold) I think is what he is referencing
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:22:39
It's been happening to everyone it's backed up it will be cleared up soon just give it time sorry this was your first experience not the best but I promise it'll only get better from here.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:30:46
Congrats hope it had a good amount on it!
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:07:47
He sounds the way trump tweets.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:26:46
Yea but once the economy died socialism killed it even more.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:14:34
Calm down and HODL if you don't freak out and sell nothings wrong it'll recover even though I don't personally believe anything is happening I just think you all are a little hyper sensitive.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:02:56
Dude it's fine everything is okay they're probably all going to halt transactions deal with what they've got then from there continue as normal. It's fine whatever you do ride the wave it's not just you dealing with this there is a whole community and we are all confident it'll be okay :) trust me you'll be happy in a month just HODL for now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:32:55
Basically bitcoin is said to be under attack because of the recent unfolding of unfortunate circumstances between the hard fork not occurring, the recent correction, the clogging of the mempool and how some people are coming after bitcoin but its not really much to worry about in my opinions it's simply just an unfortunate set of circumstances which will pass in the coming days.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:01:28
Hey man if you code it and show me a finished product I'll buy into it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:35:28
Don't worry it's been like this for the past couple of days it's just backed up it'll get there the worst thing you can do is worry just hunker down and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:47:24
That's exactly what being backed up is they're slowly getting people thru and attempting to clear it up, im not lying I'm attempting to calm the situation so people don't flip out over this it's best to keep calm then flip everyone out because that just causes more of an issue for people so stop calling people out when they're right and just trying to help the community stabilize itself.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:13:02
Last time I checked this was bitcoin not bitcoin cash buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:08:35
Very true.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:14:57
I bought $100 worth
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:21:30
Don't panic people like this it's the last thing we need.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:46:56
I say if it's below 6,500 buy because that's about as low as I've seen it dip recently
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:29:55
It'll get there just it's out there in the deep space that is the web floating slowly making its way over only start to worry if it no longer says pending and its not in your trezor...then you should worry....alot
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:29:27
It's probably afraid you're referring to the other bitcoin so they're just trying to play it safe maybe contact a mod about this issue.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:52:59
I don't know I have hope but hey it's one mans word versus another.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:23:12
It's really not I don't think you understand what is happening everyones said that since the beginning of bitcoin yet it is still alive and thriving, it is doing better than it did a month or two ago, its just because of a correction and because the hard fork didn't happen with Segwit2x so calm down everything will be fine, just hunker down and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:14:07
Nope high activity making everything very slow.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:25:11
No shot man.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:39:40
Yea it does it can turn out just as bad look at the Great Depression, hell the way the US got out of that besides WWII was socialism but with saying that recently socialism hasn't been too promising. Especially when a global superpower isn't socialist.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:41:41
Hey man he simply asked me to be the devils advocate but I like this little debate we having going, to rebuttal id like to say how while yes you make an outstanding point about how it is truly valuable I would like to just say how the internet does serve us a purpose whilst some people and I do say only SOME because it is not applicable to all could live without bitcoin but the internet is so interwoven into our society we couldn't go without it
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:00:12
With fact it's the basic crypto that everyone knows so if it fails the general community will think cryptos are useless throwing them away thus killing them all
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:18:33
No because all others are based on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:59:28
For a newbie I'd say coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:05:43
That's due to such high activity recently it'll all settle down later I don't blame you for getting out of it for now, this is just for newbies who really want to get into it and are getting slammed with all these 'BITCOIN IS DYING' posts I don't want them freaking out because all that does it elongate the whole process.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:59:44
Once you realize a true community is behind you and doing the same thing with you and holding you get calmed pretty quickly because you know you aren't alone and that there are people with much higher stakes in this then you and they're holding tight.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:17:02
I know back in 2013 it was considered the best and while I don't personally use it I have many friends who do and they very much recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:00:35
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:19:27
You're like infowars but for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:18:18
A single google search shows it's socialism which killed it man.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:48:16
I feel like it's gonna stagnate here for a while since 2x was postponed indefinitely because 2x seemed like a real quick make or breaker for bitcoin and would've shot it up in price or the incredibly unlikely event and killed it, so since he hard fork was cancelled I believe it will stay here for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:37:20
Prices will go down once everything clears up.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:30
Basically get the bitcoin core on your computer and let it run in the background non-stop what it does is it speeds up the speed of the whole network allow transactions to process better.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:50:22
While I'm not expert on this by any stretch I'd just recommend getting a raspberry pi 3 and using that to mine I feel it'd be much more effective than a usb
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:22:19
Not below $5,000 and if you think that's truly bad think again because that's better than any other cryptocurrency out there so if you're asking this to know if you should sell, don't you just make it worse just hunker down ride out the wave and HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:04:32
What site is this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:39:24
Leader of the [slush pool](slushpool.com) 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:37:09
[you can check here]( 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:44:50
Yea it got backed up and that backing up caused more backing up just a whole domino effect should be cleared up soon and best of luck with that transfer hopefully it goes thru soon!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:23:14
Thanks for the coins! And a much better community!
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:05:24
How early Monday?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:53:26
Hell yes
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:34:26
They're both still called bitcoin just one has 'cash' at the end and the other doesn't 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:45
Services are closing down transactions in order to deal with what is already happening
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:25:47
No because they know if they do that they wouldn't get re elected.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:13:25
They can't really devalue it flat out but they could try things like banning stores from implementing it as it competes with the dollar and could really just attempt to make it useless but people would find a way around and it would be only a minor negative impact, there's no way they could kill it because bitcoin isn't dependent on any government.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:49:15
Bitcoin is based on belief and not value,the dollar is based on both because it has universal value but bitcoin whilst it does have some value the value is so limited that it depends on belief and also value is determined on belief in a currency if everyone decided it was useless then it is it's our belief in the currency that keeps it going.
Then you spoke on how a belief can just go away, well I'd like the flip it and show you as evident with this recent spike to $7,000 yes belief really can just come and go because just as everyone believed in it as a currency it spiked to $7,000 everyone could just resort back to a different currency or another crypto currency then bitcoin would be dead it would be like the Great Depression it would be dead within days.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:23
Yea that's true just I think they'd rather be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:47:38
Fuck dude that honestly sucks and fuck them for being such assholes I really hope you get it back for your sake while bitcoin is still going strong. Upvoted for ya bro
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:51
I'm looking at your account currently and all it is, is jacking off BCC, BTC is not dead and will never die hit me up in a week and we will see which is doing better
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:44:40
I hope so too how much did you have In bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:20:09
Its not bitcoin that's broke It's most likely the service you're using, some transaction fees can be as low as ¢.15 when there's low activity just when tonight when  a correction like this happens and people panic in order to control the high activity transaction fees go up whenever all this calms down and it goes back up past $7,000 it should stabilize and not nearly be that much.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:07:06
Oh okay didn't know appreciate you letting me know.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:08:11
Smarter than all them they're probably going for BCH currently lmaooo
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:59:12
If you use a service like coinbase you can hold it in your account and just make small deposits so you don't create such a ruckus within the bank
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:24:12
It'll get there eventually just give it time everything is a little backed up right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:34:04
Nope not at all and neither should you because it's the best crypto out there no matter what anyone says, it's $6,000 per bitcoin better than anything any other crypto could do. so don't worry ride the wave and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:08:02
Everything will be solved soon enough faith is what gets us thru life just stay confident.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:04:05
Dude it's fine it'll go up and down and you're gonna wanna sell a lot of times you just gotta wait it out
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:59:27
That's how cryptos work they bounce around a lot just ride the wave man.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:13
It will just they'll have to clear them up one by one.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:43:17
Bitcoin is so much more stable than their tho lmao
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:11:28
Same to you man I just believe E has so much more potential
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:46:38
It means hold just it came from a forum where a drunk man was attempting to spell 'hold' and it kinda just became slang from there.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:35:21
Lol I'd do it for plain old bitcoin only.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:14:06
You're not wrong it is in shambles but you gotta act like everything's fine so the newbies don't freak out and mess it up more selling stuff clogging it up more ya know?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:38
Nope more like $5,600
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:55
Congrats my boy!
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:20:48
The same way it got to $7,000
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:46:32
Old news it's getting cleared up now
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:09:46
I believe he is attempting to talk about bitcoin (gold)
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:56:57
Fork never happened/isn't going to so people went back but that's not the only reason why the price is dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:09:14
I'd say it's 50/50 because you're gonna have the miner over in Asia that'll have flipped yet only half of the North American and european miners. I don't believe it will hit its max by 10 am but I don't believe there will be much of a profit in my opinion but who knows nobody can truly tell the future that's just my take.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:27:24
Do it when everything is clear and there's not so many stuck transactions, once that clears up buy as quickly as possible because the market will fix itself very quickly
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:48:01
A network collapsing isn't unheard of whatsoever
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:15:15
The fact it's more of an investment then just moneu
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:03:58
This is good it's going to calm the issue
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:54:45
The consensus between the whole community would be split between something like Segwit2x and something not like it, this alone could immediately kill it the same way Segwit2x did.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:36:27
Not backed by any government could fail at any moment if everyone realizes that it's just a bunch of 1's and 0's with no true value much like with paper money, how it's just paper and not actually useful. The usefulness comes from our belief in the currency which can fail at any moment. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:22:18
So have I with everyone attempting to get me onto a currency which will be back down to $100 by next week
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:08:31
That's the point of this thread if you truly wanna help the community don't worry with them stand up and try to calm them as best as you can and to be fair it's dumb to sell now rather than HODL because no matter what bitcoin will always be around and on top of that in 10ish years it'll run out driving the price thru the roof so to HODL now and not panic the community by selling more is the best bet for all of us.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:44:35
hodl buddy it'll all get better.
