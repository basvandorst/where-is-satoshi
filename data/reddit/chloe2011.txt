Dillingham, we have a population of just over 2000 people. Nothing here apart a few restaurants when they can be bothered to open, and overpriced groceries.
I'd much prefer to live in Soldotna or Juneau.

I'm going to keep my mouth shut on this and just ROFL

Good for that streamer, ain't gonna click them links though.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:33:42
How much do you need?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:52:02
and then they were fake.. sad day!

The only way to prove it is if I win, so make me the winner then I can prove it. Problem solved!
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:38:41
I don't know anyone that can help me out this way, a few people online have offered but they just turn out to be scams.
I'm hoping to one day be able to move out of Alaska or into the city, I'm getting tired of living here.  Thanks for the advice!!

None of the exchanges work for me since I live in Rural Alaska and have a PO Box for an address, and my bank card never works due to something with the address. I tried to get in when BTC was at $900 but couldn't. I kinda just gave up tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:52:25
calm down and keep bitcoining.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:14:33
Proving you have the funds doesn't prove you are going to payout.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:00:02
When I grow up I want to be a HODL-er.
I can't even find a way to purchase Bitcoin (safely) let alone HODL it! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:06:22
Calm down and keep Bitcoining.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:34:23
I keep saying this every year and I still have 0 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:13:14
Cheap fix IMO
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:51:08
Thief's don't return what they stole.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:46:31
Remain positive because there is a 1% chance!
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:14:46
I want 1 whole Bitcoin dammit!!
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:49:36
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:11:09
Only god knows.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:16:43
How do you expect us to educate these fools?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:52:01
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:58:47
That was a great read. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:40:27
Next step

Joe Manchin is a idiot this on't go far.

Erik will be taking over Gox next just wait &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:00:08
No road access to anywhere here can only fly. It's $600 to fly to Anchorage!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:04:38
Good job!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:14:17
If I can find someone I can trust I would. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:00:50
Can't because billing address not recognized. I have tried several places. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:03:03
I know it seems like an easy task but trust me when I say I have tried. It was hard enough just to open a local Wells Fargo bank account here.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:19:11
$350 for 6mb with a 100 gb bandwidth cap and it is terrible. 
A lot of people think it is cool to live here, but it's super expensive and you can't get anything done because we have nothing lol. It's a good place to visit but living here is another thing. I'm trying to make enough money to get out of here.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:31:41
I will look into this. Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:33:30
No, I have never heard of it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:48:51
Ok will try soon. :-) Thank You and God Bless!!
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:33:30
No, I have never heard of it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:20:39
It's been about an hour, 20% to go.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:15:31
Sadly no. The balance is 0.0021 BTC :( Pathetic lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:19:38
Haha I doubt I am that lucky, my other half wouldn't allow me to invest much into Bitcoin, it's probably the worst regret I have had.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:21:26
It was a pleasure to entertain you find folks at least.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:18:57
Nope not even $10 sadly. Oh well it was worth a try.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:36:05
Hmmm is this safe? I'd hate to lose the little I got.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:33:30
No, I have never heard of it.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:38:30
Ha! Well this might still be America but doesn't mean my problem doesn't exist. This is Alaska where some people don't even have running water, they need to use a bucket for a toilet and throw the waste in what they call a honeybucket. Some people live in sheds here and rely heavily on there hunting skills to put food on the table. 
Do some research on Rural Alaskan towns then BELIEVE ME!

Wow just wow..
