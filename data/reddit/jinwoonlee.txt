Hey quick question.  It's a little off topic, but does bit pay offer services in Korea that can be paid directly to a Korean bank account?  I sent them an email but I haven't gotten a response from them.  I see you can donate with KRW but didn't see anything more.  I would like to promote it more here in Busan at businesses I frequent often. I think a few of the owners at the restaurants would be pretty interested in taking it as a form of payment.

@_date: 2014-12-06 09:30:23
I've been doing it for about a 6 months.  What I did is open a Korbit account then connected it to my Korean bank account.  Then I buy bitcoin then transfer into my Coinable account and sell it there.  They then deposit it in my american bank account.
When I use KEB bank which is the one I USED to use to send money home it ended up up costing me about 48-50 dollars.  18,000 won from KEB,  20 dollars from some middle man and 20 from my american bank.  
Last week when I sent money home it cost me about 3 dollars(Coinbase fee) .  :)....Love bitcoin.

Is this Bitpays big news?
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:55:32
I believe I did everything correct.  The other paper wallets I've created work just fine.  There were only 2 of the paper wallets that kept only sending .005btc, which said was the "transfer fee" but didn't send the 1btc I sent to the actual wallet.  So I have an empty paper wallet, minus .005 btc in my blockchain wallet.

@_date: 2014-06-13 08:44:39
Yeah but what if a bank did a cost/benefit analysis and their "experts" decided that it's beneficial to run and mine Bitcoin till certain time.  Since a bank makes a lot of money transferring money and remittance and bitcoin, if it becomes extremely successful,  would  it cut into their overall profit.  Woudln't it be better for the bank(s) to ruin the faith,reliability, and optimisim of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies before it's too late to take the &gt;51% control of the protocol and show it's not that reliable?
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:12:12
I wish places in Busan would start taking bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:46:43
BUSAN!!!!! COME HERE!!!!
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:55:03
Yes I do,  they transfer the fee to wherever it goes and don't move the bitcoin to the new wallet.

Yeah,  if you already have accounts set up it's pretty easy.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:16:20
Can you do that with an account with BTC-e?  
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:48:17
I highly doubt it.  You have to have a Korean bank account I believe.
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:09:52
Yeah I hold some as well...I bought some a year and a half ago and I have slowly bought some over the last year and a half.  
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:17:37
Are they licensed as a money transmitter?  If they are why don't  they alter their business plan to also act as a currency broker?

@_date: 2015-01-25 07:19:10
Yes, at level 2 you can.  But to get to level 2 you need to verify a Korean Phone number.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:07:42
I notice using Circle it takes a 3-5 days before I see the deposit in the bank.  With Coinbase it is usually a little faster but I don't save as much since their sell price is lower than their buy price and the take a small fee on top of that.  I'm usually not in a hurry so I just use Circle.
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:44:26
U are not currently in Korea?  Do you have a Korean bank account?  I have a korean number so it was very easy and quick.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:02:11
Hmmm...I'm not sure...your trying to trade it like you would on BTC-e?
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:24:30
I think some of the savings I incurred came from the difference in price of the two exchanges.  Pretty much I bought bitcoin for $553 on Korbit and then sold it on Circle for $568.  So there is a bit of a difference in price.  I do believe Korbit charges a few cents when I send bitcoin out of my account but it's only a few cents.  And I know if I sell and withdraw money from Korbit they charge about $1.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:28:40
There is a difference in price between the two firms.  Korbit's and Circles prices are different.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:00:08
I have to deposit it into my bank afterwards then send a payment to the man
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:42:06
Thanks....Do you know any exchanges that use Authy, not Google, as a 2FA.
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:15:54
I'm not too sure....I was sleeping heard my phone ding and looked at it. It said Circle gave me a confirmation code for a transfer.  Which was strange since I wasn't trying to send money.  It did it again a few minutes later so I figured someone hacked into my computer(macbook).  So I got up and started changing my passwords for different accounts and moving my bitcoin to other "offline"wallets.  By the time I got to BTC-e they already stole it and deposited it into their wallet.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:04:43
How trust worthy is nitrogen sports?
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:35:46
Yup I use it to send money home.  It's easier than registering and buying bitcoin on Circle and Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:04:47
already have!
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:30:55
Congrats! They said it's ok you don't have to have a Korean Phone number?
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:07:13
I believe Korea has some crazy restrictions when it comes to money on the internet.  For example you need to have a "code card" in order to transfer money.   And you need to use IE on a lot of bank internets sites.   I don't believe you will be able to use it just as an exchange.  Here is a link for their different levels and what you are able to do at those different levels.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:27:11
I think I have to wait for 4 confirmations from circle before I can use the funds/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:22:34
I already put limit orders in ;) but i think it will be awhile before it hits them.  
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:16:54
I plan on it...I was trying to sell some bitcoin in Korea and rebuy in the USA at a cheaper price but this spike is going to make me lose the profit I would have made....I just hope it dips for long enough and low enough to re-coupe my initial bitcoin I sold. Then to the moon I hope it goes! 
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:08:49
I just sold bitcoin and the price when up.  So I didn't break any of the guidelines. Not sure what you're going to report about. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:29:32
what exchange are you looking at?
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:29:02
I do have some in a cold wallet that I don't plan on selling, but with the stupid BU and Segwit delima, the ETF's not getting approved, the 30-100 difference between Korbit and GDAX, I was hoping I would be able to take advantage of the price difference and sell some in Korea and buy it at a cheaper price in the States.  (arbitrage(think I spelt that right)).   But you're right this is "always the way," "sell low, buy high." 
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:12:11
Wonder why I can't log in ��
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:27:49
It's working for me now.

Email them a copy of your passport and bank info...I had to do that before they gave me access.
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:16:55
So if they are approved and 300 million is injected into the bitcoin ecosystem in the first week of it's opening.  What's a good estimate of how much 1 bitcoin will be worth?  
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:12:04
You're welcome! glad to sell you some cheap coins before the price started to go up. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:46:03
I thought since it was staying around 680 it would stay around there or go back up :)...but what do I know. I'm always wrong.
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:39:20
I use Korbit.  When the price usually settles I can usually make a profit or it only cost me a few dollars altogether.  Now though it's a little more expensive because of China.  Using the banks I tend to have to pay40-50,000won so I still save money.  15-18,000 from KEB, 20$ from some clearing bank, and 12 from my bank at home. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:23:34
Will do! I'll keep you posted!
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:43:58
You have to put in your phone number which means its not to anonymous ....but I guess it's easier than going through the process of opening an account with Korbit or another exchange which can take days.  
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:49:14
bitcoin's rise
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:41:19
I used buy off of Coinbase then sell it on Korbit when the price difference was 50-100,000 but that as when btc was 900-1200 a coin. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:32:42
Just on my way from work and saw this in the Jung-dong in Busan, South Korean subway station. :)
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:31:32
I should buy all 21mil including the unmined ones! That will jack up the price for sure. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:44:00
I think it's different.  Abra I believe individuals act like atms.  With Korbit and Circle, they are doing the buying and selling of bitcoin.  It makes it easier for an individual who knows very little about or nothing about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:19:40
I wish I had more in my bank account back home :(...I use Korbit all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:33:19
I agree.

@_date: 2016-12-16 08:41:17
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:22:53
They changed their business plan.  You have to choose a currency and stay with it for what I understand.  They gave a press release about it.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:49:50

@_date: 2016-12-28 00:59:19
My Korean isn't good enough to do the translating for it, otherwise I would.  I would like Korbit to be an exchange with their list price because I buy off Korbit when I transfer money home. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:14:08
I'd sell 1 to recoup my initial investment and pay off my stupid annoying student loans.

@_date: 2015-07-10 10:20:56
Same thing just happened on Korbit(korea) 310,000 to 360 not about 330,000. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:16:56
Well on Korbit(korea) it shot up from 310,00 won to 3600,000 with an hour.  Now its around 335,000won.
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:27:22
I still have problems with it freezing when I try to send an attachment or bitcoin. I've had it for months now. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 04:30:12
Should exchanges be marketing to countries that are about to go into default, since it's too late for Greece. Then use Greece as an example.  "Don't let the banks freeze and take away your money like Greece did.  Be your own bank......BITCOIN."  
@_date: 2016-09-11 22:49:56
I used Korbit to send money home every month to the USA!
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:37:52

There is a limit.  I paid the max limit and just paid the rest in cash.

i bought a few now how do I use them? If i wanna sell them how do I do that?
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:17:17
So does this mean if I start using Korbit/Circle again and withdrawal it into my bank account it will take less than a day to see in in my bank account? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 05:42:04
Why did Circle lower my friends weekly withdrawal to 300 a week? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:13:32
I just paid for half of my new Macbook in bitcoin at the Namba Biccamera in Japan!
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:25:09
I had that problem.  So I don't use Coinable anymore.  I prefer Circle these days to buy and sell bitcoin. After that I just put my bitcoin on paper wallets.   I don't put my trust in 3rd parties.

Working in Korea, we only pay 3% income tax and when buying things it's definitely lower than the states. I don't even know what the VAT/Sales tax is because here you pay the price you see and never see what part is taxed.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:26:02

I emailed amazon asking if they plan on implementing bit coin as a payment option because I believe what bit coin can do for our future and decided to help the bit coin community by doing my christmas shopping with bit coin.

There has been a lot of studies done on price of things.  Many people are more likely to buy things at 99.99 dollars than 100 dollars. Also one reason stock splits is because people and buyers feel like it's too expensive. Using and quoting mbtc or dbtc will make people perceive it's cheaper to buy in and they can afford it.  If we are trying to get people in developing countries we need to make them feel like they can afford it.

Hey are you going to have it in English?  I would like to buy bitcoin from you if your legit, your fees are competitive, and I can understand what's on your site.  I would like to be able to buy bitcoin with my won instead of sending it home and then using coinbase.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:46:57
Yeah,  I know.  Anything over 10,000 sends up flags which is one reason I"m asking before I do this.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:13:48
I wish I was home to show my support.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:29:32
I may do this with my friends on Facebook.

Not many people know about it yet here...when you type in bitcoin in Naver(their google) not many things come up.  However my Korean friend did send me a korean news article the other day.  :) Bitcoin should really take off soon here in Korea....I'm excited.  I've been here 4 years I hope I can start paying my bar tab in bitcoin soon!

I want to open a Korean bitcoin account, (korbit or buybitcoin.co.kr)
Their exchange is closer to mt.gox.  While Coin base is about 20 below....I want to buy bitcoin in dollars and sell them in won.  And keep doing that....I have an american bank account and a korean one.  
If I can buy bitcoin for ex: 420 at coinbase and then transfer it to my Korbit account which shows a sell price around 445 I want to do that and then repeat.  
It cost me about 40 dollars altogether to transfer money home so as long as I can buy at least 3 bitcoin with a spread of 20 dollars then I'm making money.  And if the price of bitcoin goes up I make even more.
I also want to know what kind of tax implications there may be. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:45:28
I'm not using Mt.Gox...It will be buybitcoin.co.kr or Korbit.co.kr.  and then transfering those funds to my korean bank account.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:46:12
I'm not....I'm in Korea so i'll be using a Korean brokerage.

With btc-e you can trade your bitcoin against the dollar.  They have that option.  For example right now its about .038 per litecoin. If you sell it at .040 you made more bitcoin.  After that you wait for litecoin to go down again and then rebuy.

I just did my first arbitration trade with korbit today!....I was a little nervous since it was all in Korean....From now on I'll be doing a LOT more :)  I'm glad me living in Korea is gonna pay off now!

I think we need to be a little careful with that because your average consumer isn't to bright.  And since we want people in developing countries to eventually use it, we don't want them to get scared because they see a significant drop. This could work if the major exchanges start quoting the prices by the mbtc and 1 bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:33:20
I use btc-e and trade against other crypto currencies then use coinbasee to cash out. Usually I just reinvest the profits.

I'm able to use arbitrage since I'm living in Korea. I just started doing it this week.  I make about 70 dollars per coin after fees from my banks and exchanges :). I was able to buy at $1000 and sell for 1,200,000 won which is a little over 1100 dollars then minus transfer fees.  So far it works!
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:11:40
Sounds good to me.  We should be saying something like 1 bit point is selling at 10 or 100 dollars.  This would help people that don't have a lot of money that want to get in, feel like they are getting 1 of something instead of a fraction of something.

Does this virus effect macs phones and tablets?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:59:57
I hope they do freak then sell and the realize this is good news and buy back in so I can get more bitcoin!

I have bought quite a bit of bitcoin and I do plan on holding :)  I'm trying to raise awareness.  I believe just being passive isn't helping out anything. Isn't one of the points to bitcoin is having a currency everyone will/can use?  Also I've learned in a psych and advertising class hearing things from people you know and trust, like family and friends is the best type of publicity, better than the news or some ad you see.  I personally got into bitcoin because a close friend talked about it all the time.  I don't know if I would have bought in if I just heard it.  Lately, I've had a lot of friends have messaged and talked me about bitcoin and how they can get in.  Some have bought and some were hesitant because the price.

For anyone in Korea wanting to open a bitcoin broker account theres korbit.co.kr and buybitcoin.co.kr  However they don't have it in English :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:03:01
Around 3oo dollars....Now I tested it I will arbitrage 3 or more coins at a time to spread the cost between the coins and to bring my profit up.  This was my first week doing it.

Can this/these be the intrinsic value? 
I find it valuable that we have something, bitcoin, that we can send around the world extremely fast and cheaper than a traditional bank. I also find value in bitcoin because I/we don't have to use the banks and other financial institutions. I understand we do need them but if this grows we won't need them like we do now.  
Bitcoin is also free from one single government from manipulating it. I Know they can make it illegal or put restrictions on it but they can't completely get rid of it. They also can't make more to cause my money's value to go down.
We can bypass nonprofit organizations and give directly to the people who need it.  
Putting all these qualities together in one technology/program/network; can't these things together be the intrinsic value?  Maybe I just don't understand intrinsic value.  I personally find value in all these things. No fiat or commodity have been able to do all of this as well.
