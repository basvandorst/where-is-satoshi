Please read the white paper and the definition of proof of work.

That's the thing I don't understand.
Why the fuck would my coffee shop ever be sending me money?
Most people get money from very few places: their job(s).
Most businesses get money from their customers but never pay money to them.
You have to cast the net fucking wide to make a network of bidirectional payment channels encompass enough of everything to be useful. Because all of these bidirectional channels will almost always only be going in one direction.
I don't think they will be wide enough to be useful when first implemented. Therefore they will never get critical mass to ever become useful.

This attack might succeed.
If the value of BCH approaches ~ 0.7 BTC, even after the difficulty adjustment, and even accounting for transaction fees on BTC, it will be less profitable to mine BTC, and every miner will jump ship and BTC will be dead by the end of the week.
We are at 0.33895700 right now.
If we see another 15% decline in BTC, and another 100% increase in BCH tomorrow, they win. BTC chain dies.

The new DA doesn't kick in until Monday.
The new difficulty jump under the current system hits tomorrow. That difference in timing is likely all they need. And part of the reason why so much hashpower jumped over ahead of the price increase.

If BCH hits .7BTC or so, it won't be profitable for any miners to mine BTC, even after the 400% difficulty adjustment for BCH tomorrow, and even accounting for transaction fees.
If tomorrow sees a repeat of what happened today, BTC is dead by the end of next week.

Someone should spend their bitcoins on having him killed.
They can still be used for that, right?

I was being sarcastic to underline the craziness of what was saying. 
Sort of like [this.](
There are a lot of cool things about bitcoin that make it different from paper money.
Being a medium to transmit a number representing a medium of exchange isn't something unique to paper money. That's kinda sorta what currency is...

Do you know what 'exponentially' means?

He also seems mostly retarded.

They're a bunch of spergy weirdos with poor social skills. What were you expecting?

I have a hardware wallet that I ran through an industrial shredder.

Bitcoin's numbers stored on any medium, and tracked electronically are much more respectable.
My numbers are better than your numbers.

A GH/s?
Don't be stupid. 10+ TH/s won't net that much.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:51:17
Yeah! It would be a real shame if a cabal of miners had inordinate control over the source of monetary value!

So we are learning that whenever these assholes get together in a group, they lie to each other, themselves, and the public, in equal measure.

Straight to the top.

Do you know what the word 'consensus means? It is all or nothing. You either have it, or you don't. If *anyone* disagrees, there is no consensus. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:43:03


This is you. This is how you sound.

The real word will still kill these tough guys and put them in jail and hook up jumper cables to their genitals and pull out their fingernails and stab their kids in the head.
It's kind of hilarious.

That's all that stops some people some of the time.
It doesn't stop some people.

An infinite amount of time given the current unequal starting position.
