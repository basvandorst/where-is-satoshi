perhaps if the content within the 'bill of sale' is illegal, then for sure.... 
"For sale, 3 stolen laptops and some other pirated software on usb-drive..."

I never said issue. I meant to communicate that having bitcoin as a payment option would be sweet as  key lime pie.

Binary blobs, like drivers.. sprints carrier IQ spyware , carrier bloat code like HTC contracts  linking shit...... Opposite of all that

Sometimes the program source code has been compiled into machine/CPU specific instructions when you download it. Take busybox for instance. It is an open source project. While say, similiar apple iOS programs used in their environment  are not.. (correct me if I am wrong)

Why is this such a Cool story bro? No really why is your bitcentrel better than this entire list..?

The wallet is encrypted and password protected.

The units are not meeting the spec advertised.. they will ship when the wattage is fixed. Also, it takes a lot of QA to build each one someone said. Dunno keep the faith.

How about that new reddit with 'secure storage'  and anonymous delive-site (legal dropsite). I think if the business model was as open as the bitcoin wiki, they could be a subset of crypto currency... 
Everytime I write that I think cryptonomicon...l8r

More likely to be hit by lightening than have attackers steal bitcoin keypair password by keylogger attack.

I saw a shady Buy Amazon Gift Cards with Bitcoins... Thing is, I want to spend over 50btc on some items I havnt found on sites like bitmit. Does BitSpend work with customers spending more than 1,000/usd on single or multiple items? For instance if wanted to buy a 1200/usd TV. Or two 600/usd items.. 
That's all.
