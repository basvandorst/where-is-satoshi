Thanks! I agree with them that the curve should probably be a logistic growth curve instead of a logarithmic one, however I found it to be challenging achieving a proper fit. Since logistic curves and logarithmic curves are so similar for small numbers i went with a logarithmic model instead. For larger numbers i believe the dollar itself would be difficult  to use as a measuring stick.
Perhaps compared to the dollar a logarithmic curve might even be better due to the devaluation of the dollar if we reach some kind of hyperbitcoinization. With this in mind i chose to go with a logarithmic curve.
I believe the best way to improve the prediction would be to use block numbers instead of days, this way the periodicity could be more exact.
My limited knowledge of math in general and statistics in particular might however be fooling me.

Great question! The standard correlation coefficient between them is 0.8686. I believe it could be even better if i if i used blocknumbers instead of dates when generating the cycles. Right now i have assumed the period to always be 1319 days for convenience.

If the booms and busts are indeed caused by the reward eras an interesting question to ask in my opinion is if it would be better for Bitcoin for Satoshi to have chosen a more granular reward scheme? Perhaps if the changes between reward periods was smaller we would have less volatility and Bitcoin would have an easier time becoming a currency?

        a = 6.26798265e+00
        b = 4.80385779e-19
        
        p = 1319
        cycle =  (p/2 * np.sin((np.pi/(p/2)) * (x + p * (5/6))))
        y = b * (x + cycle)**a
The constants a and b are derived from an exponential fit.
p is the approximate number of days a reward era lasts.
One interesting interpretation of this relationship is that the cycles sort of only shift us back and forward in time during the reward cycle. This is similar to the way in which Austrian economists believe central bank interest rates affect the economy.
