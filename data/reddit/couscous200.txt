YOU SUCK
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:16:03
Might as well hold it at this point.  You made a horrible decision, now deal with the consequences.  You are gambling with your savings so you might as well be hopeful that it goes back to 16k or more one day and break even / go positive
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:51:52
What should you use instead of coinbase?

It's taboo to talk about using your gains here.  You're never supposed to sell.  ONLY HODL.  It will only go up and when it goes down, oh the memes my boy, they will flood!

If the price goes down this is why, two trash ass rappers
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:15:06
Stop posting this garbage.  You know nothing about bitcoin and these are horrible rules to follow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:20:13
lol don't steer people the wrong direction mate.  You guys have no idea how low it will go this time.  Stop posting memes and start posting real information 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:13:47

@_date: 2018-08-18 15:46:18
Oh yeah almost at $7k
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:35:51
Lol you spent all your savings on a highly manipulable cryptocurrency?  Do yourself a favor and diversify, you will never move out of your parents house just buying bitcoin.  It's a good investment, but a very risky and volatile one.  I wouldn't suggest putting more than 5% of your money in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:15:17

@_date: 2019-11-22 12:07:08
Anyone know what’s causing this dip?
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:53:12
last chance to buy below 8k
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:33:46
looks like $7k is the bottom, nice bounce off that!
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:43:49
this is just a normal dip, nothing to be concerned about aka not worth of the roller coaster yet
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:19:43
Last time to buy under 8k
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:39:59
Back to $970, I say it breaks $1k again today.  If it hits $850-900, I'm loading up
@_date: 2019-11-24 15:59:27
Last chance to buy below 7k
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:51:15
you'll be kicking yourself when it hits 1.5 - 2k this month
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:29:57
I thought coinbase was super legit, you think they are doing this on purpose?
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:31:55
Received .085btc a day a go.  Still 0 confirmations and says low miner preference and 30% confidence level.
Can someone explain what's going on and when I will get my bitcoin.  Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:09:51
$800, how many people are buying right now, I'm thinking about picking up an extra 3, should I wait to see if it dips more?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:44:14
just hit $1k let's keep it going.  Wish I bought this morning on the dip!
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:24:25
I would recommend Nitrogen because coin is down rn and if you cash out once it's back around $1k you can make an extra 20% on top of your winnings
Edit: Always use bovada for teasers (way better pay out and ties don't lose)
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:46:14
Thanks so will this eventually get confirmation? Just want to make sure it goes through.  Never seen my transaction this low and unimportant 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:21:28
So there's a chance I won't get my bitcoin at all?  Should I contact who sent me it and ask them to send again?
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:55:51
BOA doesn't care at all
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:41:41
thanks for your help man
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:31:44
No I signed up when they first came out because I didn't know any better.  Please leave this thread for productive talk about this situation.  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:29:24
No way we hit $5k ever again 
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:07:56
47 cents is almost impossible.  Even if btc goes back to $100 a piece the bull run is inevitable, btc should stabilize around $100k by 2020 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:42:17
Jumping the gun man, we won't moon for 10 years...at least 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:09:31
see you at $5k
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:17:07
holy shit btc dominance at 69.2%
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:34:27
looks like $6k was the bottom
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:54:37
Daily discussion is LIT today, how low can ya goooooo
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:54:08
To $10k soon
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:02:01
Lol another 13 year old that doesn't care about how his $100 in bitcoin is now worth $60
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:37:38
LET'S BREAK THE $6K WALLS DOWN TO $5K
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:48:21
redditor for 2 weeks that has $6 invested in crypto
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:40:45
It's going up to $7k by the end of the week
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:11:46
Btc is still over $10k and ppl are calling it a bear market because of a small dip lol
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:12:19
Seems like $6000 has crazy support, any chance it breaks or is this a clear indication of the bottom?
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:23:48
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:50:47
The only way it's going to go back up in price is if people are interested in it again.  Even if it pumps up to 10k again people are going to unload to take some profits or break even if they bought during the huge pump.  If it goes to 20k quickly it will pop the same way.  It needs to grow slowly and adopt more users.  90% of this sub holds a small amount of btc and posts memes about hodling and they aren't selling.  They also say to keep buying the dip.  It's not a bad concept just buy smaller amounts so you're utilizing the average cost method.  I would take most of the bullish posts on here with a grain of salt 
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:20:59
I thought we were gonna free fall right to $5k yesterday but there is extremely strong support at $6k, safe to say it's the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:10:09
Not even 5 bitcoins on this shitty ass exchange.  Why the fuck would you post this? 
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:48:21
Wow thank you! Hope you’re having a great day!
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:08:16

Yo are these charts right, it hit 10200 while I was sleeping?
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:25:29
on your mums chest
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:51:54
No way we go below $9k
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:31:07
damn what caused the dump, we were almost at 10k
@_date: 2019-08-07 02:03:58
Spot on, no one knows for sure.  It could go to $20k or $2k but it’s still revolutionary technology that most barley understand.  If you’re looking at it from a strictly trading perspective you’re going to get burned by the whales.  The market is completely manipulated and it’s the wild Wild West
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:29:14
about to break $6k :)
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:50:21
This guy fucks
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:20:39
Wtf is going on lol
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:35:01
Damn big ole pump
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:06:39
hmm testing $6k resistance again, I don't think it breaks this time!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:29
lol get a job
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:03
lol now it's below $10k
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:11:59
And it's almost at $2k lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:36:43
Anyone worried about how fast the growth has been? Shit could easily lose half its value.  I don't understand why it's growing so rapidly.  I believe in BTC I just don't believe this growth.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:27:00
Shits going to $5k don't buy more now 
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:51:13
Dude me too! Was about to buy it on amazon for like 90 bucks, got that shit for less than 60 shipped
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:03:53
Lol this sub is filled with shit posts
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:09:42
nice job!
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:09:30
Alright alright alright
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:18:24
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:16:36
Yeah the fact that 2 buyers can change the market that much is why an ETF will never be approved.  Not sure how you would stop this.  You can argue we don’t need an ETF, but it would be a lot better if it was a ton of people buying a small amount of btc, increasing adoption, rather than whales controlling the market.  What goes up must come down?
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:10:59
And there it goes
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:55:27
there goes $5k support
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:08:01
how low is it gonna go?  and why is it dropping?
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:55:51
Won't go below $4k, you can make my words
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:08:40
No chance
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:51:29
You billed $250 but it’s only $200, I mean 190, oh actually 275.  Oh fuck it 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:18:56
Thanks for the jinx 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:04:41
3500 is bottom 
@_date: 2019-01-27 19:49:06
Good news... btc dips lol
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:24:26
I enabled 2FA and did a third withdrawal this way.  Will they all go through faster now or will I have to wait for support.  Just want to make sure my funds are safe.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:05:09
what is going on lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:09:29
shut the fuck up
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:12:21
anyone else having these issues?  Wondering how long it takes to resolve? thanks
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:51:05
Great thanks for your reply man.
Seems like a lot of people are having issues right now.  I just want to make sure the withdrawals eventually get approved.  Poloniex is a huge company.  I don't see them holding our funds forever.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:00:30
any updates? 
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:54:43
BTC will NEVER go below $8k
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:16:40
I have it enabled now, hopefully they go through soon!
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:54:33
Check it out guys, earn free BTC and even earn interest if you use the site as a savings account!  Cheers!
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:11:24
I would say it broke out of the bear market when it stabilized around $3k and broke up past $10k
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:58:59
lol RIP ETF
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:16:27
we will never go below $9k you can make my words
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:00:11
Let's break down to $6k walls!!
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:27:50
I wouldn't buy anything on margin, including bitcoin. You have to look at bitcoin as a risky investment and just go for the dollar average approach to buying 
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:21:37
Still up from last year, I think we are good btc ain’t going anywhere
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:09:02
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:42:22
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:41:49
HOW LOW CAN YOU GO!?
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:36:50
Hold, won’t break $8k
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:45:34

any updates of withdrawals being processed and support getting back to everyone.  I don't care if these withdrawals don't go through this week.  I just want to know my funds are safe.  Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:56:28
So true! Better idea would be put it in crypto and loss 30%
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:58:16
Ask yourself if you would be happy if it was good for bitcoin.  Life in general gets tougher but your $20 in bitcoin went up so you can brag to your imaginary friends
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:43:27
please make it stop
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:40:24
Seems 8k was the bottom
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:22:14
Back to $5k
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:45:16

"You see, I'm not gonna do it. I can't do it two nights in a row. I would, but you see, the way I got my bank account set up, I got a checkings and a savings, but all my money is in my savings, so I gotta switch it to my checkings, but it's gonna take 3 business days...I don't think it's gonna go through." - Kevin Hart

Exactly that guy is a fucking idiot.  It's a bear market where btc is headed back towards $5k and less
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:24:33
It won't go lower than $6k trust me
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:00:30
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:35:04
Next stop 6k
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:46:33
$5k by Christmas 
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:52:33
it will not go below $8k - EVER.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:59:12
lol it's bear time again
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:05:19
My charts show $19,200
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:02:35
Wouldn’t it be just as easy to long btc?
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:27:25
Strong resistance at $8k
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:42:08
lol seriously what did ppl expect this shit to go to $5k this month.  I'm happy it dropped
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:07:21
Wishful thinking and I fucking hope so!
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:03:03
Seems legit
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:17:46

@_date: 2018-12-07 01:00:28
Can someone tell me seriously what is going on? Is this just the bear market or is it a pump and dump on bsv?
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:35:47
Love this cult of a subreddit
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:45:12
