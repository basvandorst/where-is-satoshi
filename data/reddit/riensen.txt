An example from your laws shows, why crypto is necessary instead of laws: "When there is general consensus (for example, 80% or more of the workers agree with the verdict)". You never state which algorithm you use to reach a decision amomg nodes. Keidar and Dolev's E3PC would be a well known one. It takes three round trips between the nodes to reach an agreement. I would estimate that takes quite a lot of time in a network the size of bitcoin.

I have read the white paper, but the cryptographic scheme behind "Proof of Bandwidth" is a dead link on the website/not explained. This would be the most crucial part, without it nobody can really assess the solution.

The problem of Proof of Bandwidth is: How would a node prove to the network that it has provided bandwidth to a participant, without the network having to trust neither the participant/the node nor a central authority. As even the best cryptographically engineered algorithms break due to various attacks, it further would need to withstand rigorous peer-review by established crypto academics. In other words, this is a HARD problem, providing a solution to this would probably be a major breakthrough in cryptography. What you suggest is a rule based approach and requires trust in judges, verdicts of peers... How could you ever provide security, if it is not inherently based on cryptography?

Will there be an actual paper on this, which allows for peer-review and details performance as well as the cryptographic scheme used for "Proof of Bandwidth". Is there any detailed explanation available at all for the "Proof of Bandwidth" scheme?
