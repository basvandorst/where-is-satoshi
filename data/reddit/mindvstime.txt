That link. Isn't that a win win situation if you bet "No" ? If it gets approved (you lose), but the value of your existing coins will increase. If you win, well, then you win

Haha, really?

And how is excitement related to a multiple of the previous peak? Of course people are excited because new highs are being touched

I would say yes. It has already started recovering. But you could wait till the Eastern world wakes up to the news

In case she doesn't know, ask her how would she feel if she had twin sons instead of him. Who would have been her favorite if she had to choose one?

Are you sure? Did you verify with your parents?

Beginner here and your comments explain a lot to me about what i have been struggling to understand. So thank you. I have one more doubt. If my coins are at an exchange, and not in some private wallet, will there be something that I need to do before or after the hard fork? I have read and understand and respect the phrase 'not your key, not your coins', but still, what will happen to the coins of those millions of users who have them on exchanges? If it's too much to explain, could you point me to a source which explains these fundamentals like 'running full node' etc, which I have seen frequently in threads that discuss this issue. Thanks.

Thank you so much! for taking the time to explain in detail. That really helped.
A couple of small follow up questions if you get the time to answer
1. "old version of the coin that was supposed to go away". In case of bitcoin, is there a majority-favored version that is supposed to go STAY? and if possible to answer that, which version is that (I know the names)
2. Your explanation of full node was very concise and good for me to understand and clear many doubts. "Operators of full nodes are not directly paid". So how do they get paid (if they do get paid at all)?
I do have more questions, but first am going to read more and listen to the podcast. Please answer as short as possible, I do not want to hi-jack the thread from original discussion.
And thanks again!
