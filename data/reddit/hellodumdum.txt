Ugh, ok. Being completely wrong by making absolutely insane statements...then not backing up it up other than calling me boy? That's sensible? Ok cool you libs go back to your think tank please.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:08:40
LOL "your privilege". You realize only the dumbest of the dumb say shit like that?  It makes ZERO. FUCKING. SENSE. to anyone with an IQ over 50 (eg not you). You also realize that corporations pay tax on all the shit they buy and/or hire more people WHO PAY TAXES? Honestly, it's staggering how little you understand about basic economics. And obviously I can think circles around you, but you already knew that.  And lastly if you are rich, there is no fucking way you earned the money yourself.  You are a literal retard.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:48:33
There is no chance you have 25 years of experience in real business. Mostly because your lack of intelligence jumps off the page.  But to play along with your dream... if you were a CTO you must have helped bankrupt every company you touched.  That's cool you think I'm a "boy" (I'll assume that's racist since you are a woke lib) because I highlight the fact your comments are retarded.  Bummer that offends you but it's just reality based on how insane your posts are... yet you think they are perfectly normal / sane.  I've worked in investment banking AND own my own companies, so although Xbox is great (I guess, you seem to like it) I'm basing my comments off real world economics, taxes I've paid, taxes companies I own have paid, logic, etc.  You pull from none of that so unfortunately your dream of superiority over this "boy" fits right in with my original analysis of you.  Good luck old broke man.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:43:17
It's just you are so dumb it's breathtaking.  The fact you REALLY BELIEVE the "rich" pay 0% is so asinine it just proves you're a retard.  The "rich" pay so much of the total fucking taxes IN THE US there is nothing to argue.  You just believe the dumbfuck CNN's and Bernie's and have no common sense.  This is why America is going to shit. Fucking asshole retards like you who don't understand reality

Hahaaa condescending old man ZERO CHANCE you exited two businesses.  The fact you spelled out Internet like a psychopath tells me that much.  I guarantee I know more about tech than you do as that's my business.  And in all my years I've never come across any C-Level that talks / acts like you do... because if that happened (which it wouldn't) they would be laughed out of the room.  I definitely think it sucks that I have to pay a shit ton in taxes for delusional fucks like you to live in basements and expect people like me to pay for your ice cream and Adderall.  
Oh and by the way, zero chance you were ever a Repub.  Every single one I've met understands even the most basic economics and has at least some common sense... neither of which you've displayed an ounce of.  But that's cool you keep believing and maybe someday it'll happen you racist woke bigoted old man.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:52:46
Here's the problem.  LIBERALS DON'T LIVE IN REALITY. So you act like if I made a bulleted list of common sense points... that it would have any impact at all on people who are detached from reality?  I doesn't, I've tried.  This idiot is spewing non-sensical crap and then other low IQ libs suck it up... and this is why you have half the country wanting fucking socialism.  This is so insane that CLEARLY logic and reality don't work.  So fuck it I'm fighting back... all while trying to gain as much money and power as possible so if that shoe drops I'll be in the ruling class of these moronic sheep that wanted it. *Who will then of course complain 24/7 once it happens and they realize how horrendous it is*

I pay way way too much in taxes already.  No way in hell do I want to add another 20%++ then ALSO a huge VAT (or similar) tax.  That is pure big gov't socialism. I don't want it.
BTW I've been to Sweden recently.  Go to Malmo and see how you like these Socialist policies in practice.  $100 says you don't survive a walk through town.
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:03:27
I'm referring to the person I originally replied to... that you then jumped in to defend... thus me stating I'm replying to insane statements that you consider rational.  There is nothing rational anything he (or zhe) said.
Why do I think you're a lib?  Just the way you speak based on fear, not confidence.  I'm sure you'll dispute that but it's the way it comes across.  But I'm glad you're not a lib, and no I don't recommend being a Repub either.  Ideally we all make decisions on policy based on what's right vs what side of the aisle is proposing it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:05:33

Funny I'm heavily in BTC and Tesla as well ��. Interestingly there is one thing about Tesla that I don't hear people talk about (although Elon specifically did)... which is far and away the most valuable: they're building machines to build machines (and the software behind it).  This is so monumental it destroys cars, energy, etc. Elon said THAT is what will get them to $700B+ valuation. Love it.

Generalizations exist for a reason as they generally describe things.  And, in this case, it's astonishingly obvious that libs have lower IQ's (and for SURE lower self-esteem) than the gen pop.  Only a myopic lib wouldn't see this clearly.

There is one group advocating for a number of objectively crazy ideas / laws/ policies.  What would you prefer I call them?  They are liberals, full stop.  Wouldn't it be more unhelpful to generalize vs identifying a specific group of people who have group-think?  It's hilarious to me because an-unspecified-yet-well-known-group LOVES to put people into every bucket imaginable (insert any -ist here), yet those outside can't do that back (in a much less offensive way I might add)?  This is that-group in a nutshell.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:38:21
The second you say anything less than "cut dicks off all illegals are welcome free {insert fucking everything}"... you get downvoted here.  It's a fact.

I'm the only person in this thread w/o mental decline unfortunately.  I run businesses, live in a blue state, listen and watch what's being said and what's happening... and the insanity coming from libs is 100% undeniable.  Catchy sound bites?  That's exclusive to the left and every zhe, zhou, gender neutral (or gender plural? who the fuck knows anymore), me-too, pay more taxes 50% isn't enough!, reparations, gov't please take care of me because I can't take care of myself mainstream media bullhorn nonsense that low IQ non-contributors like yourself inhale 24/7.  But you're kind of right though in that I'm a business owner, so hopefully I'll rise high enough to be a part of the profit machine while the rest of you libs (and those unlucky enough to be washed up in your bile) wallow in that incoming socialist nightmare you believe is your utopia.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:47:56
That's because you are a low IQ blinded dipshit.  We non-libs, unfortunately, have to deal with you morons daily who refuse to use reason and/or lack the capacity to do so. In your case, it's clearly the lack of intellect.  Enjoy your basement meatloaf though!

Nothing NOTHING could ever be as embarrassing as embracing socialism.

Huh, we have different definitions of upset.  Pointing out facts clearly makes you anxious (sorry, more anxious) but that's not upset.  If I were upset I'd be screaming at the sky and crying, punching people who disagree with me, calling you a fascist or racist, yelling about how POTUS is a magical double-agent and we must banish him from Earth, trying to aggressively take your shit (including your rights), kill your new-born babies, and otherwise just being unhinged and coming at you at every conceivable front with zero tolerance for anything outside my myopic world view.  But since I've done none of that (nor will I), you can rest assured I'm quite happy and am stoked with my life.

You are so ignorant to reality I'm not sure this is worth continuing, but I'll try.  Complexities of human life? Human life is complex, but understanding what groups (like libs) are trying to achieve is incredibly easy to comprehend.  It's a low self-esteem, low achievement, low prospect herd movement that wants to bring everyone down to their level.  This is so blatantly obvious that the only people who don't see this are those (you) knee-deep in this myopia. Their social reward system is predicated on what you catch other people doing (or not doing, but still accusing them anyway) vs what they actually do.  So where does that leave us?  A group and a generation with no sense of self, looking to be outraged at every corner, no idea how to achieve personal success and fulfillment OR how to get there... so instead they say the world is unfair and feel justified in making everyone else suffer (this is perceived suffering of course) along with them.  Welcome to socialism and the nuthouse of liberalism.
