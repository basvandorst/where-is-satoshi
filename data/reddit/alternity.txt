I had to contact them basically. They can reset Google 2fa if I remember correctly but it takes correspondence.

Since 2012. I've found it fun to tinker with and have learned a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:37:55
I have the same regrets. In 2012 I got into BTC and had that "I get it" experience. I was fascinated at how reliable and innovative it was and for once made me feel in control of my money.  Due to my finiancial shape for the past few decades I couldnt in save any or get people to invest. I've spent about 50 coins since then and now am looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars I could now have as opposed to being flat broke. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:04:42
Paper Wallet for sure Ive been wanting to do this...

@_date: 2014-03-27 22:17:30
They should they already accept Gyft cards.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:32:28
Growing pains are inevitable. I admit that it is perplexing that instances of good news are currently doing nothing to affect bitcoins value. Although I think by mid summer things will correct and new interest and innovation that has been pouring in will shine and take things out of these doldrums we are seeing.

My bank account has pennies. Used to have money in it, that's how I bought what little coin I still have. And yes my account charges 10 dollars a month fees which is why I'm closing it at the end of the month.
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:11:19
I finally got to do this a few weeks ago and was glad I did. I tried Multibit a few months ago and obviously there was a bug in the older version because it was taking forever to synch with the network. But the newest version works and syncs in about 15 minutes on a very slow DSL connection I'm using. Next time Blockchain goes down for maintenance like it did a few weeks ago I wont be freaking.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:43:23
mining is going nuts
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:44:16
it's starting to get good

You've got spam!
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:02:30
Interesting. Gives me something to move up to for security. thanks
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:18:17
Im pretty sure spamming referral links is against Reddit rules
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:55:55
Thanks this helps.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:06:19
What would Jesus mine?
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:56:13
Does Multibit download the whole blockchain? Mine synced in a few hours on a slow DSL wireless connection.

I used to work in this industry. Diebold is as corrupt as it gets, they sold their voting system business.

Welcome to the club! Feels good doesn't it? It's hard to tell what will happen to bitcoin. It is a huge experiment. Keep learning all you can about it and try to follow daily news tidbits and you will start to get a better feel of what's happening in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:09:51
Oldest trick in the book.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:39:34
I don't have any stats but I bring it up with friends and strangers and surprisingly most people I talk to have at least heard of it.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:19:44
Looks pretty secure. I have an account but haven't deposited any coin yet.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:49:14
Feels like some good news finally. This makes me real happy.
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:53:30
I will definitely look into this. I have been putting off trading because I'm not really able to learn the curve of watching price fluctuations and using gut judgements.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:55:12
don't quit your day job
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:57:56
Cool that must have been kinda distressing then fun when you replicated it.

way to go. have fun with it and don't get too obsessed like I did. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:09:57
What I see as a problem eventually is that the blockchain can process so many transactions compared to the massively large transaction rate that credit cards do per second.

Gyft is pretty cool. I use it quite a bit. It is easy and straight forward. Purchases are immediately available and I've not had many problems with retailers being able to successfully use them.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:57:40
I used Gyft once at BK. The next time I tried the cashier didn't know how to. Same thing at CVS sometimes you get a clueless cashier and its a no go. Glad you're experience was positive.

I'm staying with a friend now who has internet so I'm not technically homeless I guess, but I was this winter which was one of the worst ones I can remember in my life. I'm in the US and have an old iphone which I can use in wireless mode. The whole bitcoin I had is slowly being eroded to help pay some emergency needs so I want to eventually reinvest because I'm very passionate about bitcoin. I bought in when it was at 11 dollars so I have had an experience that has taught me something about learning and saving money, something I have been terrible all my life. I want to go back to school and learn to code because I want to participate in the community.

They can manually enter the cards number. Burger King is the least apt to utilize the card as I have tried there twice and one worker was too ignorant to figure out how to use it. Also most stores can scan the phone image but I have seen some scanners have trouble scanning it due to a possible reflective issue from the phones screen so printing out the card comes in handy in these cases.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:51:54
Yes. It is a volatile currency and probably will continue to be this way for several years. Once mass adoption takes place we will see it stabilize.  
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:42:14
I'm not a gambler. But I am considering your first option. I would also like to tinker with mining altcoins but that is also out of the question for the time being
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:31:08
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:00:15
I've noticed a slight transaction history glitch. It seems its not showing transactions in the distant past, just up to a certain point. Not quite sure why.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:47:11
didn't work for me either
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:22:35
I sure hope so. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:32:09
spam dust. This was happening on a big scale a few months ago with blockchain wallets
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:35:04
least they're not referring to it as a get rich quick scheme

Wondering the same thing myself actually.

satoshi dice
Edit: that and not buying in many at 11 dollars when I first started researching

Whats the best way to turn a little under a half of a bitcoin into a whole bitcoin?

CVS gift card from Gyft. Fast and easy and I received 3 percent discount. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:23:06
Let's hope so. I like Amazon for the most part. I can see why they want to develop their own form of digital payment services though.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:03:38
I'm not saying this will actually happen. But I have faith in this technology and hundreds of millions of investment capitol and some of the smartest people are backing this train.

Isn't that a great feeling. Welcome to the community.

All I can is lets hope they adopt bitcoin. I do Amazon Mturk surveys and today I took one that mentioned bitcoin and got a good feeling.

Once you set up a hardware wallet and have your own keys you will see.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:08:55
Why not I had one but lost it somewhere. Kuckilly it didn't have but a few satoshis on it..I still have the seed tho.

Well at at first that sounds what happened to me after I enabled it. But now I look at my settings and it says I neverd did set it, so now Im confused.

Did you recently enable two factor authentication?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:52:34
Yes and each day brings more happiness. At this point I don't really care if we see thousands of dollars or go to zero. Time has come for change and this time 1's and 0's will triumph!  
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:05:10
I am no mathematician and I guess it's impossible to predict value of bitcoin through mere graphs and charts but this gives me a good feeling.
