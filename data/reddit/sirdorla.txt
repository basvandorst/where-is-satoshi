*Unsheaths katana*
Seriously though, your misinterpreting that source a lot. 
 of electricity generated is *USED*. 
The phrase *rejected energy* dosent mean the electricity is generated and thrown away (also impossible), it means [the electricity was never generated in the first place]( Think of it as a efficency percentage. Like every normal car will make 500hp of energy, but only 150 of that is kinetic. It dosent mean the 350hp are somehow "not used" and thrown out the window, it's just heat and noise that isn't useful. Working on reducing this number is important but your not the first person to realise more efficient power generation is important.
Also like I said, it just highlights how important it is to reduce energy consumption. 
The problem is [crypo is already at 0.5%]( This is a massive number when you think on global scale. Then imagine how much it would use if everyone used crypto all the time, a market cap billions of times what it is now. Its not sustainable and someone needs to find a solution. 
If you really believe in crypto's mission you should highlight the importance of finding a solution for things like this instead of just trying to distract people by complaining about the laws of thermodynamics as if it was something created specifically to undermine it. Crypto has to work past this if it ever wants to achieve global adoption and by sweeping it under the rug your actively working against crypto's future.

Yes this is a innate problem with electricity that's existed since the first wire and is physically impossible to solve completely.
It also means crypto, or anything that uses huge amount of electricity from the grid, is a even bigger problem because if the supply is inefficient that's added onto the extra demand already being created.
I don't really understand why you brought this up, but it really just highlights how the energy used for crypto is a big deal.
