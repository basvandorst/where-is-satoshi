Likewise it is also more profitable for them to not create a fork which could cause confusion or concern in the market and hurt their earnings. Its interesting because people talk about how raising the block size will harm decentralization. But right now there is centralization in china. Raising the block size may knock out some of that centralization which would actually decentralize the network.

So can you choose a fee based on how soon you want the transaction completed? I didnt realize that transactions could be chosen by the miners, I thought it was all automatically put in line as they come in. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:54:26
Lol it literally was designed as peer to peer. And if we are both running full nodes it functions as such.

If you've got 11k to lose then sure. Its just a lot of risk to throw down. No one can predict the next swing, its still possible for this all to go to zero.

Per my current understanding, the best solution to me seems to be Bitcoin Unlimited, which allows variable block sizes and leaves the choice up to the miners on what they want to mine. This also is interesting as over time a common block size will emerge as the most popular.

My understanding is that for the lightning network to work you will need to have hubs with adequate coin to cover transactions. These hubs are centralization and exactly the kind of thing bitcoin was created to avoid? From wikipedia it claims that the attempt to raise the block size to 8mb with [bitcoin XT carried 75% of nodes support. But that was not enough to pass.]( In general when 75% of people agree on something it seems likely that is the correct move. The reason I ask all of this is out of concern on the future of bitcoin. As I read more it does appear that the future of bitcoin core is not in line with the original whitepaper? Again i'm new to all this, I've really just been digging deep into the tech today. I'm by no means an expert and literally this is "just what I've read" 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:54:10
But there is an argument against that. Should we hamstring the system so that people on dialup can contribute? That seems like a poor strategy. Likewise you don't want to make the block size so big that only miners on commercial fiber lines have the bandwidth to contribute. There is obviously a true block size limit, but is it actually 1mb is the question. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:09:54
With lightning you are literally going to a system similar to the dollar. IOU's based on Bitcoin, like paper money based on gold. Transactions handled outside the blockchain is an entirely different concept and really no longer relies on bitcoin. The system is vastly more complicated and essentially throws away all of the bitcoin theory and advantages in favor of faster and cheaper transactions. I cannot predict what the end result will be, but to me, it seems very similar to fiat systems currently in place.

So use layer 2 which defeats the whole purpose of blockchain, yay!
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:20:39


So? You yourself said that 2mb blocks (which would also be equivalent to doubling the transaction capacity) would be full the moment they were deployed. So while it is a solution to double capacity without increasing block size, its a small bandaid at best no?
Satoshi seemed to implement the 1mb block size with intention it would be change before it was an issue. It was implemented for spam reasons and not for decentralization and mining reasons correct? Was it not the intention all along to raise the block size. Even if that wasn't an ultimate solution. 


Does that include the other bitcoin forks?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:58:04
Blockstream has 8 devs working on bitcoin core, it also accepts private funding and has raised some of the most capital of any bitcoin entity. No other company has as many devs paid for bitcoin core work. IE blockstream contributes the most in funding (by paying the devs).

These are the only exchanges that seem to link with shopify at the moment. Coinbase is not accepting new business accounts so they are out. Which of the remaining 3 is the best? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:45:20
Maybe I should post another question for this. But how does the transaction make it into the permanent ledger then? When the transaction comes down is it only handled by one miner or multiple miners that then share the ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:27:42
It wouldn't require a hard fork. A fork is when there is a split. Rule changes can be enacted without splitting. The problem is things like lightning will create payment hubs. Which is centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:09:10
It has already been forked, this is where bitcoin cash came from. I am in the research process as I said. The implementation of the 1mb block size seems that it was intended to be temporary. But now that Satoshi is gone it is dependent on all nodes agreeing to raise it. Something like 75% of nodes agreed it should be raised but that was not enough hence the fork. To me, bitcoin looks unscalable with a 1mb block limit, you claim that raising the block limit will increase centralization, but not raising it will harm the network, and will also cause centralization by implementing things like lightning which will require hubs. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:43:54
Is it true that the 1mb limit was placed as a temporary stop for spam though? And that while block propagation could be an issue at some size, 1mb is not necessarily the cap where suddenly everything beyond 1mb creates centralization?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:58:51


This sounds just like the peer to peer bitcoin dream :/
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:55:47
If you spam it at 100M and no one picks up 100M blocks it won't be processed and that will be the end of it?

Which fork are you referring to. My understanding is that there hasn't been a bitcoin core fork in awhile. 


Most miners want an increase in block size. Its not just the chinese, so I don't agree that its going to grant them more power. I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion. 


Because of the great chinese firewall. Data in and out of china is slower than much of the world, north america and europe for example. By raising the block size you may take some of the chinese miners with slow data throughput offline. This will inturn reduce the amount of miners in that location, which decentralizes the network a bit.

Smart investing is Mr. Negativity? TIL.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:11:54
It does suck, and its still an issue with other coins, like bch, you can't scale the block size forever and jumping to 8mb is just a temporary fix. I have seen people compare bch fees to btc but thats pointless because they aren't comparing volume to volume, while bch fees would still be cheaper at same volume in the future they will still grow outrageously high. I just wish there was another solution being proposed as I dont think lightning is the right move personally.

@_date: 2017-12-28 02:56:02
That is not true. You setup a transaction block and then transfer ious back and forth till the completion is sent and it is written to the block. You don't seem to have a very solid understanding of bitcoin or lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:05:43
There are significant fees both when you open and close a channel and have to write to the blockchain. There are also fees for transactions as that is how they encourage people to let themselves and their funds be used for hops.

TLDW? I thought coinbase was the most legit in the US? Thats all I know and all i've really looked into. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:46:45


Which when you scale adoption is still going to result in very high fees, so theres that. 


But they do so by forcing the use of hubs and locking up currency. These hubs may be subject to federal oversight which will essentially make them into banks. While I agree that bitcoin needs to evolve to compete, that doesn't mean that lightning is the best solution.

It is 100% artificial
NO SHIT?! And could those programs also be kept with artificially low limits because it allows a company with patented side chain technology to make money off the artificially low limit hrm?


Yes it is


No they aren't.


Yes it will. Even core agrees that with segwit and lightning they will still need to increase block size at some point. 
Lol this is my favorite one thanks for posting it, I guess you didn't make it to the end?


In order for the Bitcoin ecosystem to continue developing, the maximum block size needs to be increased

Can you post a source with who the top funders are?


Are you referring to segwit? The blocksize has not increased on core since it was limited to 1mb by Satoshi in 2010. Feel free to post a source stating otherwise. 
Lightning is necessary because the low blocksize is resulting in high fees and slow transaction speed. If the blocksize was increased so more transaction volume could be handled fees would decrease and speed would increase. Reducing the need for the lightning side chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:41:27
That is true. You have to ask yourself this. Blockstream is the primary contributor of funding to core. Blockstream stands to make alot of money off lightning networks. Isn't it surprising that the core won't upgrade their block size, which makes lightning necessary, which benefits the funders of core... hrm.

Bitcoin was supposed to be peer to peer. It was supposed to eliminate the "trusted middle man" and his fees. This is throwing all that out and going back to a system similar to checks and credit cards where theres a middle man processor. Why do we need this new form of currency when its becoming more like the established old one that already works?
