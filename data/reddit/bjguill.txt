You may want to consider the Planetary Society.
Their mission is "Empowering the world’s citizens to advance space science and exploration".  They work to produce hardware that can ride along with other missions launched into space and do many other things.
They accept Bitcoin:
Here is information on their 501(c)(3) status:

Probably TMI here, but after years of drinking lots of Diet Cokes and Diet Doctor Peppers, my teeth aren't anywhere as bright as I'd like them to be.  Would probably have to photoshop them to look nice if I showed my teeth all the time.  :-)

Are you talking about State-specific licenses, FinCEN registration, or something else?

Ha, yeah I get that a lot.  Problem is that my last name is hard to spell for most people, so the first name is much easier to spell out if I'm trying to tell someone the link over the phone.

It's much harder to be profitable now.  When I got my first two Jupiters, the price of Bitcoin (compared to USD) was skyrocketing and the Difficulty wasn't too bad, so they were essentially money printing presses.  Now, the BTC-USD price is about half, the Difficulty is sky high, and, if you are in the US, the IRS rules aren't favorable to miners, so a significant chunk of your income goes to taxes.  You have to really do your homework to determine if you will ROI.  If you buy a miner these days, while you may not make much money (compared to the past), at least you are helping to support decentralization of the network, and that will be important for the future.  We've already seen a big evolution as the industry moves from individual miners to large multi-thousand machine mining data farms.  The latest machines from various firms are also very loud and very power hungry, making it harder to run from people's homes.  My Jupiters are whisper quiet compared to my CoinTerra and Spondoolies-Tech machines that both sound like jet engines.

I had that happen with an account at Union Bank (regional bank on the West coast), and it was likely due to a combination of wire transfers and Bitcoin transactions.  They are legally not obligated to tell you why they are closing the account.  Technically, they sent me a warning, but it went to my PO Box and I didn't retrieve it until they shutdown the account, so it was a surprise at the time.
I've had many transactions with my Chase account and Coinbase over the years and have not had a problem with Chase, though my last Coinbase transaction was back in March or so.

How is this for proof?

Wow.  I guess since Kardashev Capital has spilled the beans on their losing bid ($221.51), I can spill the bean on my losing bid.  My company, joyteq LLC, bid $51.63 per coin for one of the 2,000 coin blocks.  I figured it was a giant longshot, but you never know if you might just get super lucky (low turnout, or perhaps people only bidding up to the amount of the required deposits).

I sent in my registration information and completed the wire transfer for the deposit on Friday.  (I'm doing it under a LLC co-owned by my wife and I.)  I have not been confirmed as a bidder just yet--I believe that should happen on Tuesday.
Probably not the best idea to announce intentions prior to the auction.

Chase locked out my account yesterday because I initiated a wire transfer to Coinbase.  I had to call them to answer a few questions.  They asked me why I was transferring the money, and I told them I was simply sending it to another account.  Then I was specifically asked "Is this for Bitcoin?"  I got worried for a second, but figured honesty is the best policy, so I said "Yes".  He then asked if I planned to do additional wires to Coinbase, and I said "Probably".  He said "OK", and unlocked my account, and approved the wire transfer.  It was a bit odd.  I've done ACH transfers with Coinbase before without incident, but this was the first time I tried doing a wire.
