What's fair about everyone taking a loss instead of only the wallets which were hacked?
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:00:25
So, like not even a basis point of the population? Shit.
@_date: 2016-08-16 11:49:46
Good explanation, but no new information. Not actually from BitFinex
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:16:03
What's the hardest scenario to guard against? How does Coinbase handle that scenario?
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:04:27
That's exactly fair, actually. You put your bitcoin in someone else's wallet, that wallet gets hacked, you take a loss. They are cutting USD and all alts here.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:18:40
It's a currency exchange, everyone is nothing but greedy
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:18:36
Then why does your title seemingly address the block size debate?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:20:07
Except it's not a solution, now everyone is affected instead of just bitcoin holders
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:27:09
Props to them for not "socializing" the loss.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:26:14
So when one of their crappy alt-coin wallets gets hacked, we're going to be OK with them socializing that as well?
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:36:41
Unless you were holding an alt
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:56:24
This sounds like you are attempting to place the main share of blame on BitGo, which I can't imagine they deserve if your servers were breached, and if you were their only customer with this incredibly unsafe setup.
Looking forward to more updates, but so far pretty disappointed in how much hand-wavy language there has been.

My opinion is that were past that point, but I would be happy to hear yours
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:47:04

I can start copy-pasting from the articles if that will help you

And pay the trading fees to do so
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:19:16
Why would exchanges or miners care to lower bitcoin fees when they can just use cheaper chains? It's already happening
It's up to devs to give the users what we want
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:15:01
Sure a lot do, but I doubt players like bitfinex or polo would use it to generate transactions

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:57:53
I didnt say they have ties to Russia, you're putting words in my mouth again. I asked why an organization devoted to transparency would take such an action. Im questioning the idea that they are in any way unbiased or more trustworthy than a press organization
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:56:57
Not if they have to pay trading fees to buy BCH, or transaction fees when sending to another exchange
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:01:40
It might not deploy nicely with their infrastructure (maybe they have different concurrency needs), or maybe they want logging it doesn't come with, or instrumentation, and maybe they want all of these things, and in a language they can work with easier.
For broadcasting using core makes sense, but not necessarily for transaction generation or wallet management
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:17:09
Its all one search away,
Its even on their wikipedia 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:33:39
If a new chain has majority miner support, why shouldn't it be Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:43:41
So the same leak appeared in two places, WikiLeaks, and in court records. Only file was different between the two, one showing a $2b wire between Russia and Syria - WikiLeaks release omitted this file. Pretty cut and dry
My question to you is, why are you so willing to accept their lack of explanation? They've been asked during every AMA, and the only reply is boilerplate
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:59:03
Then it's not a Bitcoin integration - it's a Coinbase one. I assume any currency would be useable then
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:15:37

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:34:10
Not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill
I'm also not saying anyone Russian is bad. I'm asking why an organization devoted to transparency intentionally left out a document pertaining to Russia, and only them
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:47:03
Exchanges should be rolling their own wallet software, usually.
Core is built for individuals. Plus with the volume of money an exchange handles you can't really expect them to process it all with someone else's software.
One of the times Cryptsy got hacked it was because they used the native wallet of some shitcoin instead of building their own.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:03:04
That's not arbitrary though, its people making a choice. If the trade volume and miners choose a fork, that should be bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:50:44
Also the "quickly" word here can't be accurate. I can't remember the last time I had a transaction go through in under 20 minutes

Coinbase never mentions localbitcoins. All they state is that the levels of activity in his account require action. Then they asked for three pieces of information, and at that point you talked about selling bitcoin.

What they mean to say is that a distributed public ledger using encryption is a great idea. That would be basically a blockchain. However, using bitcoin's blockchain may not be good for everyone.
Say Bank of America wants to use a blockchain to transact with other banks. It would be fast, secure, all that jazz. They wouldn't want to be subject to the current volatility, though, so they would basically create their own alt-coin that is fixed at a 1:1 ratio with the dollar, and transact that way.
That is what most of us mean when we say that the blockchain has promise, but it may not necessarily increase bitcoin's value.

I live in Pensacola.  The city/county is very hostile towards the homeless.  It's a typical "look how that free-loader exploits the system" mentality.  The city thinks Satoshi Forest will be a focal point of crime and make life too easy for the "murderous, free-loading, drunken" homeless.  
Additionally, the police in the area are known to beat, shoot, or run-over anyone they deem scum, and get away with it.

I'm not saying government is humanist, I'm saying that money contributes far more to human suffering than any single social structure.  I would rather see finance and banking turned  upsidedown than just not get taxed.  Taking away government does not reduce death of the population, people will still organize to gain money and power.  If money is more democratic, the need to kill is diminished.
In my opinion.

I'm certainly not willfully disregarding facts.  I'm trying to help you realize your post is pointless, and relies on straw-man arguments.

This statement is not entirely true. Ripple is essentially centralized, but it still incorporates cryptographic security and fast transaction speeds (when compared to ACH). Ripple gives the banks a way to stick to their business model while adopting some of the benefits of Bitcoin.

I paid for merchandise yesterday in bitcoin at a physical retailer, no information is stored.  However, brick-and-mortar retailers are allowed to, and DO store information on your shopping habits based on your credit card.  They build customer profile databases and market to you based on that profile.  [Here is one story about it.] (
Also, for you paying off your credit card at the end of the month may be a convenience for you, but not for everyone, some of us like other options.  I bet you would see it as less convenient if you needed to put some kind of emergency charges on your card and lost your job the same month.

They call it a meme coin because it is based on a meme.  
Bitcoin is just named Bitcoin.
Just because it's idea has spread (a very little bit) through the culture, does not make it a meme.
It's a product.  Bitcoin is a meme like the new Honda Element is a meme.
The picture of the Shiba Inu was already a meme (internal monologue dog) , so they based a coin on it.  Thus, a meme-coin.

I hope your right, but the fact is that the U.S. pays triple the price for half of the bandwidth that similarly populated countries do.  The difference being that countries like Sweden and South Korea have invested in fiber-optic infrastructure that encourages real open-market competition. 
Edit:  Similar market manipulation happened with electricity in California back in the 90's, when Enron would have it's subsidiaries deactivate power plants strategically in order to drive up the price of electricity.

I treat bitcoin as my long-term savings.  I put 5% of my pay into it, and spend another 2% of that at a local pub that takes bitcoin.  I'm young enough (I think so anyway) that if it fails, I'm fine, and if it goes where it should I will have a nice little security blanket.  It's all about risk assessment for your personal situation.

Everyone had an idea things were bad there, the community was in denial.  Fiat withdrawals took months, and support was non-existent.  The only reason the price stayed near 550 is because the top-brass held their coin and told others in the know to do the same.

With the Authy app, as long as you maintain the same phone number, installing the app will automatically generate valid login tokens for you.
That being said, having a backup is always a good idea.
If you plan on changing phone numbers, Authy has a process for that (here:  If you maintain access to both phones, you can do the change with no trouble at all in your Coinbase settings. Also, you can always use the Authy app for Chrome, which will generate valid tokens on your PC.
The PC app will make you more susceptible to hacking, but you can use it as a band-aid during your phone change - just use a unique password and uninstall it after you make the change.

In case you are wondering why this is in the Bitcoin subreddit, I guess this is the reason: 
“In two years, we will be the biggest company to offer two-factor authentication,” Palacio believes. One area outside of the enterprise Authy has made some real inroads, too, is Bitcoin (which also explains at least partly why the Winkelvoss twins invested). While Authy will emphasize enterprise adoption in the near future, Palacio did stress that he believes that “the really big growth is in developers adding 2-factor for their external users. And as they do that, they also add it for their employees.”
Also, they are partners with Coinbase.

I am less worried about the trolls than I am new visitors.  
The troll campaign was used by cigarette companies for decades, and by creationists today.
By creating an unfounded argument and sticking to it, it creates the illusion that there is an actual debate with two opposing points of view. In reality there is one small group antagonizing a larger community.
If we prominently display real instances where bitcoin is not ideal, or shortcomings, it demonstrates that we are building towards a goal instead of simply selling a product.

With bitcoin you don't have to worry about your personal information being sold or stolen, and there is no need to pay it off after the fact.  What you buy will not be kept in a database with your name to be used for marketing later.  Also, you save the merchant money in processing fees.

They have great discussions, and most of them are pretty well versed in how the protocol works.
They troll us because we take the smallest things as if it were life or death, and does get ridiculous at times. 
Just look at this rhetoric, "...a new system that moves power out of the hand of the elite and back into the hands of the people." That isn't proven, that isn't a fact. Bitcoin is a developing technology, and it is whatever we make it to be. puts the carriage about five miles ahead of the horse.
The term "statist" is thrown around here with the same tone you would call someone a "bitch" in prison. That isn't normal (or preferable).

I don't think block reward is an inefficiency.  Miners need incentive, and as price rises more people begin mining.  As price falls, miners leave for more profitable coins.  Block reward is what makes Bitcoin work.

No doubt at some point exchanges would want to use funds to expand or other ventures.  Let's say they offer account holders the option of investing in the exchange in exchange for reduced fees or a return later.  I guess I'm describing a Certificate of Deposit offered by the exchange.  Would that be a workable business model?

I will start by saying that "Scalability" is somewhat of a heated topic even for the most informed.
Each individual transaction does not carry it's whole history with it, although it does include information pointing to the previous inputs. In this way, since each transaction points to its origin, it is possible to track the funds to their origin, without each transaction carrying the entire history with it.
Keep in mind, this does still does make the entire blockchain to grow larger and larger.

The "request money" feature is awful, and is different than "send invoice" which does present a bitcoin address, and can be sent from your merchant tools. 
For yourself, you should have just logged into the mobile site on your phone's browser. From there you have a few options to see a bitcoin address.

Driving down the price does not hinder its ability to be used as a reserve currency. The executives and employees can still hold personal funds in Bitcoin, or the company can set up/participate in a bitcoin investment fund which would be allowed.

Try organizing a local bitcoin meetup, and when you know how many people you have interested you can approach locally owned bars and restaurants with something like, "We would be interested in having a meeting here for local bitcoin enthusiasts, it's about ten or fifteen of us that live here, and we would love to pay our tabs in bitcoin.  I can show you how to set it up, and it will save you around 2% per transaction."  
What worries about bounties for people giving leaflet to businesses is that while it would work in many cases, there would be those that hound businesses and end up giving bitcoin a bad image locally.

Their "head of risk" describes it pretty in-depth here: 
tl;dr, the key is broken up and in the hands of multiple people, behind different physical vaults in different parts of the world.

I would not.  Part of the reason I like bitcoin is the potential for cost savings by getting rid of the VISA fee structure, this would mean part of your transaction still goes to VISA, and the processor.

NN doesn't give anyone the ability to block content, so I don't have to worry about who to trust with that. Without NN ISPs can block or throttle to push you to their services. ATT already has a history of doing that, when they were blocking Skype 
Today the government can block content. Without NN, the government and the ISPs can block content

What you're suggesting is that we boycott all legal bitcoin operations in the US, including individuals selling on localbitcoins. That is not realistic or beneficial.
Any entity selling bitcoin in the US over a certain volume is considered a Money Services Business, and is required to report illegal activity on their platform. At least CoinCafe is telling you ahead of time.

Good news, I think we're both right.
If the merchant was using an iPad they couldn't have been using an the merchant app because apparently Coinbase doesn't offer one due to "restrictions by Apple" ( So they would have been using the normal Coinbase wallet which isn't intended for merchant activity at all. It does offer a QR code, but not when using the "request bitcoin" function, only when viewing your wallet address.
In this case the merchant would have been better off with bitpay.

I am a seller on localbitcoins that operates in cash, and yes the public location is a must.  I prefer to text or email with them in great degree to find the place and time that works for both of us.  Play it honest and in public (it's a legitimate exchange, no need for shadowy stuff) and remember that if anything feels off, you can walk away and take the necessary steps to cancel the transaction.  
Edit:  I manage at a restaurant too, I've also given BTC customers I meet on my break free cookies or appetizers just 'cause.  I see local cash exchanges as a great way to build the community, and again, if it feels shadowy, just walk away.

So, taking three-five days to transfer money globally for fees ranging from 2%-14% is the monetary equivalent of the wheel?  Considering today's communications, we can do better.  That's where I see the bitcoin protocol coming in, or something based very closely on it.   Visa charges retailers anywhere from 2-5%, and these are businesses sometimes making 1% margin.  
There is a place for credit, but the credit system is becoming synonymous with cash, and that's just not going to work in reality (as shown by the global recession).  I don't think bitcoin will overtake banks or money, but I do think we need it.

Guy I've known for years was pretty skeptical when I told him I put some money in BTC.  I explained to him the limited nature of bitcoin, that it can't be counterfeited, and that even though there is a frenzy for them now, even if that wanes that the usefulness of it will always have a place somewhere in the world.
He's a big smartphone-tech guy, so I told him to download a wallet.  As soon as it finished, I sent him $0.10 worth and told him to Google some about it.
He registered at Coinbase yesterday.

$12 to transfer $100 is not negligible.  If you instant transfer their maximum, $2999, the fee is $145.  With bitcoin it would be pennies, and the receiver would not need to go pick it up somewhere.  
This is what we call 'better,' also faster, and cheaper.

It is as anonymous as you make it.  Because of the public ledger, laundering funds can actually be harder than using cash to do so.

If banks were the safest, securest, and easiest they could be, we wouldn't need bitcoin. =)
I should have said it initially, by secure and safe I meant not accessible to anyone outside of the user.
I know for those of us that know what we're doing current solutions are already safe and easy, but there is still room for an app that is intuitive to the average person in design, while enabling multiple levels of verification before any transactions can be sent.
Coinbase could be there tomorrow if they would allow (or even make default) 2FA for all transactions, and released a wallet program for offline storage that can interface with your online account when desired.

As I understand it, there is a contingency plan to provide a client option that will only save the most recent transactions.

That's 12%, that is FAR from free.
The entire premise of this conversation is that bitcoin is still waiting for a company to make them more accessible.  I don't recall saying that "BITCOIN IS HERE IS BETTER THAN WESTERN UNION"  but that it has the potential to be.  
My friend in Burma(Myanmar) who has bitcoin already, we transmit funds seamlessly, no problem, much cheaper and faster than any other service.  My initial point was that we are still waiting for a company to develop an accessible wallet for the person without computer security knowledge.

Your definition of 'negligible' is not shared with business owners and most normal people, I'm sorry.  Also, bitcoin saves a lot more time if you're talking about parties already using it.  So, the longer you use it, the more time and money you save, setup cost is covered by future savings.

I can tell you I'm one of those regular guys that just bought in last week.  I work in fast-food and when I tell co-workers what bitcoin is, they not only understand, but they understand the implications and immediately ask how to get some.  One high-school kid even said, "Well, we moved away from the gold standard initially because paper was easier to move and transfer.  Bitcoin could be like gold but without that problem?"
As techinical as bitcoin is, the benefits can seem obvious.

No doubt it's not great, but it's not all bad either.  Did anyone really want banks as part of the bitcoin structure?  The notice did define bitcoin as a commodity, giving some clarity on how it will be taxed, and still allowing for it to be traded.  Whether or not it's traded for goods or services isn't something they can stop at this point.

Bitcoiners don't like ripple because ripple hopes to provide some of the benefits BTC can but in an entirely centralized and controlled manner.  For profit.
  If Ripple got itself out of beta and solved the question of  initial distribution, then partnered with a major credit card company, it may pose a threat to BTC  becoming 'mainstream.'

Coinbase is dealing with the same uncertainty we are when we buy BTC.  No company on earth would hire going "OK, yesterday we did X transactions, surely next week we will do 400% of that.". If they take their time to find the right hires maybe it's because security is their priority.

They also won't let me buy any more until then, even though I've been paid since and would like to buy more BTC.  Today they start allowing new users to instant buy up to 1BTC, meanwhile my .5 is still processing and I have to wait until Monday (after the senate hearings) to buy another .5, when the price will either be $600 or $60.

My point, although sarcastic, is that more bitcoin can't be made out of thin air like other digital currency issued by central authorities.  Bitcoin has uses and security, unlike other attempts at digital coin.  This is why we believe in it.
The idea has been around a long time, but bitcoin has gotten closer to perfecting it then ever before.
