Storing your entire savings in the wallet that you are using to reap mining rewards would be analogous to carrying your life savings around in your pocket. The bitcoin wiki talks about [splitting your wallets]( between spending money and savings. This would keep your money safe when you are not trying to spend it.
But when you _are_ trying to spend it, I imagine that even a financial institution can't protect you from a trojan keylogging the secrets/passwords that you use to log in.

If someone had a _true_ majority, they would have the ability to destroy the network by making it untrustworthy, but the Bitcoin network is impervious* to a Sybil attack since there is no (\*known) way to fake the proof of work that valid nodes are doing. One way or another, you need the majority of CPU in the network in order to re-write recent blocks of history.
Satoshi's argument was that the long tail of participating nodes would be sufficient to protect the network, but also that a participant with a majority of the processing power would have more to gain by simply reaping the rewards of block/transaction processing than by doing something like double spending, which would cause the value of whatever they stole to drop (due to lost trust).
An attacker would need 1) interests external to Bitcoin (which would make it more profitable to shut it down, rather than to profit from it), and 2) a majority of CPU power. Competing digital currencies, governments and corporations have the most to gain.

It's a nearly $1 million a year salary for maintaining 2-5 servers. My point is simply that you will not be taking food off Tycho's plate.
MtGox has other infrastructure to worry about, including dealing with banks, lawyers and the government. They will need every penny to stay legal.

They ask for a copy of a passport or drivers license. After providing ID, the limit goes to $10K/day or $50K/month.

Calling it speculation implies that the speculators are looking for growth patterns without bothering to understand the fundamentals.
I've invested in Bitcoin because the technology behind it is innovative (see: [Byzantine fault tolerance]( and because that innovation has enabled it to become the first of its kind: a truly decentralized, consensus-based currency and transaction system.
I'm investing in the growth of an economy around Bitcoins: if a new business accepts Bitcoin safely (not exclusively: credit cards aren't going anywhere), it has very little to lose, and plenty to gain. There are 8 exchanges so far, and I'm counting on it becoming easier to exchange Bitcoin to and from local currencies. Since it is subject to local law, this is one of the riskier points, but even assuming the worst: the developing world needs Bitcoin more than the US does.
As an example: count the number of people in this thread that are unable to pay the author for his book:

It's a cartel without any barriers to entry: all you need to do to become a member of the cartel is have some CPU power, and you can help keep them honest. That is why it is so important to mine solo or in smaller pools when you can afford the variance.

Would love to see another example of distributed proof of work used to solve the byzantine generals problem. I wasn't claiming that digital currencies as a whole are new, just that distributing a thing makes it into an entirely different thing: that's innovation.


You are a master of generalizations sir, but yes: this is likely true. I expect the value of BTC to [fluctuate before stabilizing]( in the long term. The only question is the height of the Plateau of Productivity.


You're hand waving here: I don't see why not. You have to wait at most 20-60 minutes to sell BTC, and it can be completely automated. Your risk is the amount that BTC can fluctuate in one hour.

Your wallet does not contain Bitcoins. It contains private keys which certify that you own an address in the block chain. Bitcoin is a currency backed by the stability of the network maintaining the block chain.

Difficulty changes do not drive the price.
Price drives profitability which drives the number of people mining which drives difficulty.

You'll note that I commented on that article on May 18th. While more anonymous than Bitcoin, Lucre is _not_ decentralized: you still need a trustworthy party to handle the minting process.


You are speculating.


Yes, for the cases where it is already possible for you to use your accepted-everywhere first world credit card. But Bitcoin enables transactions that used to be impossible or impractical.
And we haven't even begun to discuss micropayments, but they will also be a significant driver of Bitcoin. Tada: 1E1uxpBaPVAJroFUHQ4Ui2EHAU3igrUTPw : an address specific to this comment.

Assuming you give coins to that new address, the transaction can be traced back to any of your previous addresses. If you have managed to keep your entire transaction history anonymous, then yes, that will work. But that is very unlikely without a _lot_ of precautions.

Your 2 or 3 partitioned nodes would need to complete 2016 blocks at the previous difficulty before it would adjust to a comfortable level for their throughput... which is essentially impossible.
Also, the "length" of a chain is defined by the total difficulty of the blocks contained in that chain: a chain of 100 low difficulty blocks could be "shorter" than a chain of 1 high difficulty block.

Smaller attack surface area. When you plug it in to a computer, there are a very small set of carefully controlled interactions that the computer and the device make. A large part of the safety is due to not running a full operating system (Windows/Linux/etc) or any other software. Fewer access points, less potential vulnerabilities to exploit.
