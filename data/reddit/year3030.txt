Bro chill out this isn't a crash it's a correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:48:15
Honestly you guys should sell *some* if you are holding quantity. This is a good price. In my opinion it's pretty much guaranteed that at some point the market will crash again. It will then rise again, but this is a good time to lock in some profit. If you are wrong and want to cash back in later you are only losing a fraction of what you could have lost compared to a crash.

Well when BTC hit $1000/coin a 50GHs miner looked pretty attractive if they had them in stock, as they were advertising.
I was one of the original pre-order, took 9 months to ship. Ordered another one, just got it 6 months later. So I know the drill.
When they were advertising immediate shipping though I obviously questioned this. I would have ordered if it was actually immediate and had a guarantee, but yeah bullshit as usual.

Soooo why are you guys leaving your coins on an exchange in the first place? You should setup your wallet on a netwbook or print them to paper. Seriously.. that's the beauty of the crypto is it not? And when you want to sell it might take an hour tops to transfer.
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:13:45
If you look at a forex chart you will notice that most currencies are trending right now and the US dollar is pwning everyone. All this means it that serious investors are most likely not paying attention to crypto right now and haven't been for 3-4 months because there is HUGE fucking movement in the currency markets.
So crypto will creep back up at some point. I haven't paid attention to any of the charts for a while but currency goes up, and down. Just remember that BTC is not in an isolated environment / market.
Edit: After looking at this chart I'm glad I cashed out at $1,100 ;)

I'm hopping around and trying to scan the net for new coins so I can get in first, hold and get out. I seriously think though that Doge is a great bet. You don't know me from the next guy but I'm usually right. I'm not saying it will ever hit prices as high as BTC, but worth it.
If WDC doesn't have a long term upside I probably won't mine it. The ones that are good at the ones that are first or change the platform, like Litecoin did with Scrypt. 
I'm mining PeerCoin right now since it has some added benefits and they are "tending" to the network in a careful manner.

@_date: 2014-10-05 13:17:42
Well it's not necessarily volatility but it's a wide range and technically it's a trend or a rally. One of the major factors are better than expected numbers for jobs reports. News moves the market plain and simple. So if a lot of numbers and reports (not just the jobs reports) indicate the US economy is improving hence strengthening the dollar.

Man.. when will people learn. It only costs like $200 to trademark something with the USPTO. If Gnome desktop or other projects don't trademark their stuff, well experiences like this will teach them how important it is to file some of the usual paperwork. 
I won't create a new product or company name if I can't trademark it. And that is also one of the first things I do. 
So the lesson is that $200 is &lt; tens or hundreds of thousands defending your name in a legal battle.

@_date: 2015-02-08 23:30:13
Well it will be but we don't have the technology yet. I have some theories on this however I haven't formally written them up yet.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:19:24
Why divide this into two camps? It's really a spectrum if you ask me. Think about the internet in the mid to late 90's, that's when business took over and it changed the landscape of the net forever. BTC will pretty much be the same thing if you give it enough time, unfortunately. I was a hardcore internet believer back in the late 90's but that didn't stop the landscape from shifting.
As far as the selling I think it depends when you want to get out.
I just wrote a lengthy price / strategy post that explains some of my current reasoning as to when to get out, you may find this interesting. 
Honestly I think both camps you have outlined sound nice however there is more to it than that. Not to mention that in order to have a currency be worth something it has to be liquid so those people that are selling and buying are providing liquidity to the market. 
Without the liquidity factor everyone would just try to sell and the price would bomb because no one would want an asset they can't move. So even if people are selling right now it doesn't mean they aren't true believers they are in a sense the spark that drives the market engine. 
On the converse the people that are holding are providing a solid foundation for the market not to slip too far. The market currently does not have a well defined pattern except climbing and then retracing. I haven't done any technical analysis but I bet it would follow fibonacci levels nicely. So both sides create the dynamic liquidity and the foundation to give the currency value. Just like if no one was selling, if everyone was selling you would also get a crash.
So you need to have that nice in-between of buyers, sellers and investors who hold in order to drive the market and give the currency value. Right now everyone is doing their part.
I personally took my hard earned BTC and purchased some new mining equipment. Does that put me in camp one or two ? :) If I had to pick one I'm a free range investor who is going long and going to try to time the exit strategy just right. So someday I will exit, or maybe start doing some strategic sells / buys but that doesn't mean I want to be labeled a non-believer. Let's not forget that this is also a currency and if you want to be successful you also have to have an exit strategy.
All I'm really trying to say is that it's not as black and white as we might want to make it.
NinjaEdit: I think the reason it doesn't matter is because the believers know the price will go back up and the tech will survive.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:31:32
I wish you could get gold for this.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:38:18
If you know how BTC works its based on the hashes generated by the SHA256 algorithm. The puzzle that BTC solves is trying to generate a hash based on random input plus the previous block to generate X amount of characters of the hash of the previous block.
In a similar sense if you set the target to be 1HiMoM it's relatively easy to generate vanity public keys that start with the first few characters you want. 
So if you wanted to generate a hash that starts with 'a' it would take a few miliseconds, if you wanted one with 'ab' it would take a few more, 'abc' might take a few seconds or less, etc etc.

eBay does a lot of what we call split testing which is A/B testing. It's highly possible it's still there, just try clearing your cookies a bunch of times, try different browsers and computers. Usually you can just clear your cookies and hit ctrl+f5 a bunch of times until you get a different display.
Marketers do this all the time to sell you more crap, they change their site and test it to make sure it gets higher conversion.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:19:26
Disclaimer: I am not giving investment advice whatsoever and this is my own opinion and you should make your own decisions based on your own research.
I didn't get a chance to read today but yeah what OP says - I mean seriously it's an investment in an INCREDIBLY risky asset - It's 100% risky you could lose EVERYTHING.
I was actually talking to a high profile investment analyst tonight and they won't even touch it with any sort of length of pole because it's so risky.
My personal opinion though regarding the market behavior over the last year is that the price spikes, dips and stabilizes and then rebounds 4x. 
In 2010(?) it hit around $28 then crashed sub $10 and was around $9 until Jan 2013. By May I believe it was up around $268 then dove to as low as $63 (That's more than you lost now if you bought at $1200, for perspective). Then it stabilized and rose to around $130 until it gained momentum and jumped to around $1200 (twice) before dipping. This is part of the market pattern, get used to it. In my opinion (make your own judgement) the price will stabilize for a couple of months and then rebound again and hit $1200 or go higher.
BTC is purely speculative and hinges on market psychology more than any other currency or asset. It has built in panic syndrome. 
So don't freak out and hold your position until you can exit cleanly or with a profit, the price will bounce back in my opinion.

The only thing that the price of gold and BTC have in common are that the prices are very close to each other. Specifically gold has been used for investing for a long time and is a natural resistance level (check out support / resistance if you aren't familiar with it). 
So I agree its arbitrary and it's all psychological. Gold has been used for a long time though to measure wealth. If BTC can pass the price of gold all we did was break through a resistance level and there will be another one after that and so forth. I think this is going to be a hurdle though and the price will probably hover around 1200 for a while. We will see if I'm right.
If it goes above 1400 / 1600 then I would expect some more big jumps.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:44:01
Couple of things.
DWAVE is basically a super cool (super conducting) calculator. This means that it is fast at *some* operations however not at others meaning it would not be good at cracking encryption, as the wiki states.
However I do not consider DWAVE a true quantum computer but rather a fast calculator using super conducting materials.
My understanding is that a true quantum computer will use bits (qubits I believe they are called) which compute in infinite parallel universes. So if this is a feasible computational model then there will be no encryption (except quantum encryption) that cannot be cracked. 
Just as a side note quantum encryption is based on the spin of a particle. If it is observed mid-transport from A to B then the spin changes. This is based on the physics principle that if you observe something you change the result. So it's not true encryption it just lets you know that your communication was intercepted.
A true quantum computer will most likely be developed by a government and if they wanted to crash the network it would be a sneak attack and there wouldn't be time to upgrade since they could corrupt the block chain, start draining accounts and cause a market panic that would result in BTC being worth virtually nothing.
In fact the computers I described are supposedly in existence but they only have a few bits since they are hard to make. So even though they might exist they are not powerful enough to do any damage currently.
And lastly every security expert will tell you that nothing is 100% secure, ever. There is a saying that the only secure system is the one that is turned off and unplugged.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:13:04
I haven't gotten around to writing my thoughts in detail yet however .. this is pretty normal. I mean the price hit around 260 or so earlier this year, dropped to like 60 and made a comeback. 
All currencies and markets rise and fall. The major problem with Bitcoin is that there isn't a central authority to help stabilize it. 
So the best thing for all of us to do is just hold and act as the backbone. E.g. don't panic sell. 
You should still buy and sell to give liquidity to the market and take profit but don't freak out and sell because the price is dropping, it will be back.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:42:23
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:43:56
The rule of thumb for the BTC market is that the market is going up. Don't get spooked, you need to hold. I never thought I would see 1k this year this makes me think it will hit $5k next year.
The way to enter or exit the market is in steps. If you are going to sell to protect from losses then sell half. If the price goes lower buy back in. If the price goes up you are still in the game.
If you are entering the market spend half (or one third) your capital and hold, if the price goes down you "double down" to offset your first entrance point.
If you think the market is crashing, get out! Frankly I wait to see a significant dip or put an order in for very low, like $500 so I don't have to sit around and wait for it. I'm basing $500 on the previous low after it hit $900. 
A better target today would be to set 1/3 your capital at $800, $700 and $600 so as the price tumbles you get more skin in the game at better prices.
Then for an exit do something similar, sell half at $1200 or a new high.
Honestly though I would just hold. I have more faith that the market is going to go up than it will go down so once you are in I would just hold.

Yeah I know, I'm just surprised that one vid card and two asics could heat an upstairs ;)

I guess the biggest question I have is whether or not BTC will significantly pass the price of gold, currently it's hovering around par. If it hits 5k I would expect to see 10k at some point. Essentially this market is a perfect bubble because there really isn't an underlying asset, resource or central authority to direct it. As a perfect bubble it could just keep climbing until everyone gets spooked.
People will get spooked at significant price points like $1,000, $5,000 etc, all the high round numbers. That's why the price dropped at $900 because someone who knew what they were doing was getting out before everyone else got spooked at $1k, at least that's my theory without looking into it. The price hit like $900.43 though and tanked to $500 so I think it's a good guess.
So I would sell before the price hits those points, then if it climbs out or dips get back in if you want. Or it's always good to take some profit.
How high will the price go? I think the highest would be 100k but I'm not holding my breath. I wouldn't be surprised to see 5k or 10k though, and maybe someday 25k.
In general though I give BTC 3-5 or maybe 10 years before someone brings a quantum computer online or does a 51% attack (think government backed hardware production) in order to trash the market. It would be interesting to see these scenarios though to see if the network can evolve. I think PPCoin protects against a 51% attack so the BTC network could always evolve. 
The way the blocks are solved using two SHA256 hashes may protect against tampering using a Quantum computer because of the level of complexity to calculate however the public / private key system is potentially vulnerable against quantum attack. 
One of the definitions of a quantum computer is that the bits calculate in infinite parallel universes though, so even a double SHA256 hash may not protect against infinity. The current "Quantum" computers though are just super cooled calculators and are only really good at some operations and they don't even know the physics behind it. 
This is all speculation on future timelines of future tech that is being worked on. No one can make any solid predictions so just do some homework and go with your gut.
TL;DR Getting back to the original comment, 
I guess what I'm saying is I woudln't be surprised to see 5k, and if we see that it could get even more interesting. This all depends on the market psychology. I think the current barrier is the price of gold. So probably if we hit 1600 or even 2k we will see the bubble continue on up. If the market hangs around the price of gold then we might be around $1200 for a while.

If quantum computing takes off we might have a problem:

Because you get paid more. It's a vicious cycle.

Yeah I spent my life in the most rural of areas, to each their own. One of the places I went to school growing up was literally a "village", not a town or a city. The city I grew up in had about 4,000 people and t was the largest city for 100 miles.

I had one of the original pre-orders, I was around 3000 so I was one of the first to receive my shipment. When I first got it I was raking in the BTC left and right but as I predicted the hash rate spiked. My earnings have dwindled however I made enough BTC in the first 15 days to pay for the hardware. Albeit I had to wait 9 months to get it.  So my BFL story is bitter-sweet with a happy ending.
So the lesson is that BFL takes forever to ship so anything you buy now will not be worth it in the future.  
However if you are investing in BTC for long term investment get whatever ASIC hardware you can assuming you can calculate how long you actually think it will take BFL to ship to you (9 months probably) and how much your device will make at that time. Weigh that against your budget and your investment goals and there is your long winded answer to what the best option is at BFL.
Right now I would pre-order the ASIC based PCI cards that they are pimping on their homepage. These have the same power as their mini-rigs for about 1/4 the cost plus you should be able to stack them into a single 4u chassis.
With that said look to other vendors, but the wait is probably just as long and the price just as high.

50% is a rough guess, depends on how cold it is.
