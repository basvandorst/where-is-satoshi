BTC is making an insidious headway. The result will show - be hard to ignore - soon.

Other alts may gain larger market caps because their blockchain issue unlimited quantities... I agree.

The first to enter the market (ETF or Bakkt) will enjoy the first mover advantage. Whether it maintains the grip will be a thing for the market to decide.

As much as I would have loved to share in your view to an extent, don't you think the applicants (CBOE, Winklevoss' etc) and the regulator (SEC) would have said so from the onset if it were a mere impossibility? I mean that would be tantamount to an insane waste of resources on both parts preparing and reviewing the filings.

I'm close by: between $50K and $80 in 2021. This range is more likely to be realized IMO.

Agree too. It's like this is what many anti-ETF campaigners don't understand.

That'd be awesome!

I agree with you that the system seems unsustainable. But I am not a financial expert hence my confusion. The global economy seems to be edging towards a downtrend but some players are saying it is not likely to result in a collapse. We'll see.

Adoption is  key. From ordinary users to merchants, Bitcoin gets stronger the more it is used thus reducing its volatility which in turns repeats the cycle - more people agreeing to use it and it gets stronger and the volatility lessens etc. Its current high volatility rate is, on several levels, a major setback.

You can hardly win arguments that are based on generalization. Try to be specific in a particular area and you might be good to educate your opponent(s).

Your point is valid and well-noted. But I think it will go through this time. I can't say why though other than they (SEC) are quite aware of the martket's expectations with regards to Bitcoin ETF and, on the other hand, CBOE has been around for a while. They (CBOE) ought to know what to do and how to do it to get the desired result.

I guess it's being used already. It may take some time to fly!

The anonymity angle to Bitcoin makes a lot of sense. It has been set free to sail on its course without any recourse to hold anyone, in particular, responsible for its direction. The other point about network effect also played a role. There is this aura about Bitcoin that makes it a better choice than all others.
