It is instant for me. They require 6 confirmations tho.

That is a very good experiment, because I am gonna bet that nobody from this thread will actually try to crack it. Its like saying - "Hey guys, I didn''t lock my car today, so if you can find it - its yours. I live on Earth and my car is black".

As a person who lives in a 12th world country, nobody knows what bitcoin is, so imagine it as if it is banned here, but yet I am able not only to invest into it, but trade (in this case there's plenty of foreign exchanges) it. You can't exchange local currency to a foreign one here, not in the bank, so basically it is illegal... but who knows what I am doing with my bitcoins? It's so awesome.
I mean even if you can't use it in your country, you still can invest, transfer - that's the feature, you can't just BAN it like that.

I am sorry, but this was brutal.
When I see something like that, I can't help but think about all those people who invested their time into it's creation. People who care about it, people who are proud of it...

It was your choice. I just felt sad, because you destroyed someone's work, something produced my human being, with love (or without)... it is time, it is history.

OK, so you are saying that modification is NOT random and is systematic, to put that in other words, the manipulation is "reasonable" for human mind.
The problem here is that even if you pattern is "reasonable" machine still will have to try ALL possible options making it *nearly* impossible to crack. What you want to see, is bunch of redditors spending their free time guessing HOW you decided to mask the pass phrase. Machine can't guess, too brutal.
As for the idea of "insecurity" related to those wallets, I think the problem is usually with users forgetting their pass phrase and not other people cracking it.

Its not $450, its a whole BITCOIN!
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:41:33
Sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:09:08
Did they ban internet? One can't just ban bitcoin.

Oh yeah, since we are talking about it, any chance to get iOS 6 version?
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:24:51
Well, I thought it was produced in China... and I believe they are humans. 
I am not trying to force you into thinking different, I am just expressing my feelings. Not in a mood for arguing about very subjective things.

When my electrum says received but unconfirmed, can I send it out before it is confirmed? 
@_date: 2015-07-26 08:45:04
Right for sure!
