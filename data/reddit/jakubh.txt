I will launch an ICO for verified reddit promises. Only need $10 million. I will try to do the shitties website and bad name. So early investors are rewarded by 100% growth after re-brand and polishing the $300 website.

$3 - $4 fee to move Bitcoin, whether $1000 or $10, and those who pocket it call bankers criminals :-)
Last time I checked you can transfer money in Europe/Australia for $0,- and it takes reasonable one day.

That's the way of 95% crypto "businesses"
ICO - we will destroy the billion $$ companies who rip you off with 15% fee. Our fee will be 2%!!
Idiots (investors) - wooow, so ground breaking... here is my money
Few years later - still no customers, bankrupt
They aim to please the wrong target group - like Travala to hotel owners by charging less % or Request network to vendors by lower fee / no chargebacks.
But the vendors and hotel owners are irrelevant, nobody gives a shit what they want. Those who decide are the customers. And you won't take over the customers when you undercutting your own revenues by 80% so nothing left for marketing

I don't want to sound harsh, but you have way bigger issues than you realize. I read whole thread.
First - unemployment now with one of the lowest unemployment rates ever is your choice. Not everyone gets to be a successful dj or an actress because they feel they are good.
Second - common sense? Struggling to pay $1.5 for laundry and $1.5 for drying - what about using your bathroom sink to wash clothes, and dry it naturally? You know how people did it for hundreds of years.
Third - you talking about "little luck" to become a millionaire making it sound easy. It isn't. If I understand correctly you were in the army on foreign assignment with stable paycheck and almost no living expenses (they provide accommodation, food, etc, right?) which allowed you to drop $x,xxx+ every month on bets - and one worked.
If it would be easy you would made another million before you wasted the first one. And you lost it all because of your overconfidence.
I wish you the best, you sound like super nice person. But paying for LA cost of living while trying to find "dj" or "actress" gigs won't be easy, let alone to get rich.

So deep... I'm sure the payments I've done 15 years ago were never compromised as well.

Are you 10y old? Your comment is stupid on every level. And hopefully in the next few years they will teach you at school some of the oldies stuff - for example how to make paper.
