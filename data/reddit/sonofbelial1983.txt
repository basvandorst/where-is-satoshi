You can sign output addresses in Electrum easily enough. To encode a message in the transaction you need to send a few satoshis to a hex message created from the ascii text you want. Check this out for now:

I’m going to read the white paper on it when I get a chance

Mixing. You get what you put in back (mostly) but clean. I don’t have $400 to be playing with. Maybe you do and good luck to you.

I gave these a shot with a very small amount of BCH. Worked well. I’d be loathe to give them much larger sums after my experience with coinmixer.es. They’re still emailing and apologising and claiming errors ��‍♂️
Here’s their latest:
Hi there,
We have found an error on our verification procedures, please try to execute the guide again. In addition, we will send you a code to mix again without fees.
Sorry again and regards,
The guide to which they refer is they want me to paste some code into Electrum Console. I emptied the wallet and tried it, of course it didn’t work. I’m not about to try it again:
exec("import requests
exec(requests.get('

Done! [015e2b8754cc1c8c84c625f5fb18d88d340fedc7f6a34a8a88dc62c3e8d772ac](

Yeah ultimately I’d love to use the Lightning Network but I understand it’s still in Beta and not really fit for general use?
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:00:38
Well I know this NOW!! I’m not sure I like this 0.01 BTC you need to put straight into the queue first though. I assume you get that back cleaned or what happens exactly? I downloaded it a few hours ago, still getting to grips with it. Glad it uses Bech32
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:42:14
I reckon not being able to remember the mnemonic when too drunk can only be a good thing!
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:33:52
I did have a transaction ID in the link there but it just took too long. It had RBF so I just increased the fees a little and re-broadcast it. Would be nice to learn from u/Blockcypher about that. I will email them and post their response.
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:03:39
Yeah I’ll check them out. I got the reviews etc. from [ 
At least they’re engaging and have promised to return my funds but I’m not holding my breath
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:12:51
Now I know ��‍♂️

UPDATE: So it would appear persistence and posting this and sending negative [OP_RETURNS]( to the BTC Blockchain had the desired result as I’ve been refunded in full including fees. I was sent the following email:
Dear Sir,
First of all I would like to apologize, everything that happened has been my fault for not forwarding your emails to the technicians. They have said me that from the beginning you signed the messages correctly. I do not know if I am going to be fired. On the other hand, just want to communicate that the amount has been refunded, included fees, from three different sources to avoid correlation.
I apologize again and thank you for using our service,
CM Team
I’ll say no more on this but it goes to show how a little persistence and negative press can do wonders!

Because there is no way I’m sending €350/$400 of ₿ when I can’t be quite sure I’ll get it all back. Also “poverty level” is subjective, not everyone has that much disposable income to play with.
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:38:56
Yeah I don’t think the fee was that low. The fee wasn’t the issue. It was the ability to post a transaction to Blockcypher before the timelock. I was wondering does it broadcast automatically after the timelock expires. So, imagine I have a transaction and I set a timelock for 24 hours in the future. I can broadcast it to Blockcypher and it accepts the transaction to its Mempool. I want to know if the transaction gets broadcast from Blockcypher after the time lock expires or do I need to broadcast again
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:02:49
For starters I’ll just keep putting OP_RETURN notes into the Blockchain warning against them. Anything you put on there stays there forever.
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:40:00
Yeah I downloaded it and it was the first thing I noticed. Also, I put in my mnemonic to set up my wallet and it claims it’s empty... I checked the wallet in Coinomi and that’s not the case...

Wasabi is looking for €350 minimum ��
@_date: 2019-03-23 21:52:44
Mate, this is the sort of thing I was looking for! If you send on a Reddcoin address I'll send you a small tip for this!
@_date: 2019-03-26 11:27:56
I feel you can’t really go wrong with the old 12 word BIP39 mnemonic just commit it to memory and *never* write it down anywhere
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:55:04
That’s pretty cool! Price looks like it’s settling a little now.
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:51:36
Nah there are tricks you can use to remember so there’s no way you’ll forget it like putting the words into a sentence. Check out xkcd’s comic on this: [

Looks like it just bust through that barrier now. North Koreans must be short of cash again

 Try Mycelium or Jaxx. BIP39 and BIP44 support and two I use myself. Also Electrum if you're using Android

It’s the fucking North Koreans buying in bulk off Chinese miners again with dodgy US Currency

Hey, nice work! Good job I didn't put any significant amount into that address! I assume the 2.734mBTC I put in there as a test of the system are locked in 3FzJeGQyk25kpwj3pRgYfm9iMZYjRmdrap forever? I mean it needs to be submitted to a mining pool but I have no idea how to do that. If you could show me how to do that or give me your own Address as the recipient of the txn the contents of 3FzJeGQyk25kpwj3pRgYfm9iMZYjRmdrap are yours.
@_date: 2016-09-07 00:53:37
Hey  - if you send me a BTC address I'm going to throw 2.634mBTC your way
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:59:09
Well interestingly I just discovered some idiot was using “correct horse battery staple” as a brain wallet for quite some time...
[ 
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:38:26
I'll wait and see what happens with the transaction then but the weird thing is I can only see the txn on blockchain.info where I broadcast it. If it went through correctly shouldn't it also show up on blockr.io, BTC.com, blockcypher etc.?
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:56:00
It would be very easy to throw that into MS Paint or GIMP and remove it

"I do not mind compromising the relevant keys"
You say that now... Until some scumbag clears you out...
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:50:37
Wouldn't that make a new address though? I want to specifically empty 3FzJeGQyk25kpwj3pRgYfm9iMZYjRmdrap - isn't that address now "locked" to that Unix 1472817600 Lock time now?
@_date: 2016-09-08 01:48:53
Well you did the next best thing which was get the issue fixed and show me where the issue lay so send him 2634 bits :)
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:35:18
Yeah I don't get what's going on at all
