Speaking of which, is there a way to change what directory the bitcoin-qt client stores the blockchain data, I'd like it not filling up my smallish ssd.

Well no, I suppose you could monitor the device for an extended period of time. Not like it can transmit data magically.

That's the problem with labels like liberal. People aren't black and white, just because you like Obamacare, doesn't mean you also like gun control for example.
I consider myself pretty liberal. I don't see a world without any form of government working and thus if people are then forced to live in a world with government, a certain standard of living should be provided. In my mind that should include the the ability to get health care without going bankrupt and becoming homeless.
Since I can't just go into the forest and build myself a house wherever I want for warmth as well as plant food on the land, welfare should be provided so that people may afford to live in a home and eat.
The same thing applies to roads. I can't just build roads to where I need to go, so the government should handle that.
Money doesn't fall under any of these type of stipulations. It is just a tool used to trade and a better tool is a better tool.

Which will never happen. Gangs would form, and then larger gangs would form and so on and so forth.

I am incredibly happy that I randomly ran the client like 3-4 years ago for a week or two and got 50 bitcoins. Still have them. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 06:44:22
My argument wasn't that roads wouldn't exist, my argument is what stops one guy from buying them all up and charging huge amounts to use them. There is a finite amount of space for competition and in well established cities it would be pretty much impossible to compete less you tear down a bunch of buildings.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:34:56
It is extremely unlikely every person who owns bitcoin will lose them. Even if all but 1 existed, that one would be divided up amongst everyone since losing them all like that would not happen instantly but be gradual. Even if there are only 0.000000000001 BTC left, it would just be divided more.
There is a bigger chance you will get hit by lightning or die in a plane crash, and yet people still walk around outside and travel.

Sorry that sub seems to just be full of people bitching about various things.
I like driving on roads, and taxes pay for them. Sure some private company could also build a road, but they will most likely charge me to drive on it. Maybe they will decide to increase the prices while I happened to be driving my pregnant wife to the hospital.
All I see are millions of situations like that being a possibility. Like this guy  he mentions how politicians don't give a fuck about any of us (and I would agree), but do you think these types of people will just disappear. They will seek power where they can find it and you will have smaller pockets of the same bullshit happening all over the place.

Road company 'A' buys out road company 'B' and 'C' effectively becoming a monopoly of a large city.
How is the free market going to fix that? Is someone going to buy all the buildings in a line, tear them down and build more roads?
@_date: 2013-09-18 05:02:56


Well technically that wouldn't happen in anarcho capitalism since there wouldn't be any countries, but I haven't read anything to convince me that wars would still not rage on as they have since the dawn of humanity.


I think there will be more lessor assholes, death by a 1000 small assholes. I also don't think the balance of power will stay balanced, there will be someone who manages to get more power than most everyone else and they will abuse it as history has shown time and time again.
@_date: 2013-09-17 23:22:19
This is silly. If states break down there will be chaos in those areas until they reform again in some form or another. And who is going to maintain the internet or power generation for that matter while this chaos is happening? Of course without stable internet and power how are you going to effectively use bitcoins? All those people who bought shiny metals instead will be laughing at you.
If governments don't form, gangs certainly will (safer in numbers after all). Those gangs will prevent you from travelling on their turf so there goes your ability to travel wherever you want.
What's that? Some conglomerate poisoned your water source? Guess you will have to pack up your things and leave since there are no more regulations and they don't give a fuck about you. Maybe you can find enough people to form a militia against them or something for revenge.

I haven't moved my coins in 2+ years so that is not really a good indicator, I just have 2 wallets, one for spending the other for holding.

I read an article on slashdot 3 years ago on bitcoin, thought it was cool and downloaded the client and mined 50 coins and then stopped because I was freeloading at the time and didn't want to use so much of their power. The recent hoopla has gotten me interested in it again.

I supposed that depends if he even cares about money if he can convince his army to enslave a group of people to do work for them for free or else we blow you the hell up.


Who gets to decide which "private, voluntary legal framework" gets to be used? The victim or the accused? Let's hope there are no conflicts of interest between the two parties whichever it is.


What if the serial killer is really good at hiding the bodies, so that they don't even know if there is a serial killer or they were kidnapped or ran away. The Insurance companies doesn't pay shit and there is no one to pay the police to investigate since the families of the victims are poor.
I know kidnapping insurance! Then rival insurance companies can kidnap the clients of other insurance companies so that their rivals have to pay out large claims and put them out of business.


Unless they used bitcoin instead of anarcho paypal.


So he admits that it is completely possible that states would arise, but at least we got a fresh start?
As an aside, his writing isn't very accessible, it reads like an end user licence agreement.

That is the issue, even if anarcho capitalism could create a stable society, I would have to research every decision I make taking up a considerable amount of my free time. 
How do I know the beef this butcher is selling me is safe to eat. Mad Cow doesn't show symptoms for years. All mandated health and safety standards are gone and while some are ridiculous and overbearing some are most certainly not.
Also look at how much stuff we import from other areas, if that is to continue and there are no regulations, how the hell do we know what it is we are eating.
I can't just avoid food from certain places since there will no longer be origin stickers on my food.
The main reason humans were capable of advancing technologically as far as we have is because we didn't have to spend all day procuring our own food and doing everything ourselves.
Also what about radio frequencies, want to broadcast a radio station? Too bad some kid is also using the same wavelength. What some asshole is jamming your cellphone, tough luck.
What if two people own half a small lake, what prevents the one guy form syphoning all the water out of it into a reservoir he built.
How are land claims made, since there is no laws which means no property lines and thus what are you going to do about me building a new fence an extra couple feet closer to your house then the old one. Can I kill him? Do I tear it down? Or will he "fake sue" me for damages? What If I try to sue him but he never agrees on a judge and stalls and stalls, is there a time limit to come to an agreement on who the judge should be? But then what happens when that time limit is reached. What if he argues that the old fence was not built at the edge of his property. Would there be some private property line record keeper? How would that record keeper be at all profitable? Or do those who don't pay the record keeper risk getting screwed? How is the record keeper vetted, what prevents that record keeper from faking records after being payed a nice lump sum.
Also what about all the land currently owned by the state, who gets that? Can any Joe just go there and start clear cutting trees and selling the wood?
@_date: 2013-09-18 03:12:31
Those communities would become the new state. Over time more and more rules/laws would be put in place as they got bigger. Some of these communities would turn into cults. Some would strip away the rights of minorities and the weak. Communities would fight other communities. It would be another dark ages.
