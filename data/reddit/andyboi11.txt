This concept is so obfuscated, my head spins. When Bitcoin can't make it mainstream(as seems to be the case now), will this ever? 
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:47:25
If this is true, then I am afraid I am gonna have to agree with what apple did. I know I am going to get downvoted, but unless the bitcoin industry gets it act right and deliver consistently good products/services...like functioning exchanges/following KYC norms/govt. regulations, apple store rules....blah blah... we are never going to earn the trust of the mainstream.

That's no surprise, their currency is fucked up and has been tanking a lot lately against the USD. 1$ is worth 11k rupiah. People would lap up BTC at the drop of a hat if it were available there.

My prediction : Bitcoin will move to no.5 Spot by end of the year only behind Visa, Master, Amex &amp; the chinese Company.

In the short run no1 knows.. 1$ is also possible like you said if a big flaw in the protocol is unearthed. Other likely scenario : some other crypto takes over... But if BTC goes mainstream, the price is only going one way - NORTH
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:09:50

@_date: 2014-02-04 15:06:36
Problem with using terms like micro, milli, nano is that they are not intuitive by themselves and rely on the major unit. So when some1 says for example 100 micro BTC.. you need to divide BTC by 10^6 and then multiply by 10^2. This can be overcomed if we have a name instead for an intermediate subunit.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:33:39

You are mistaking counterfeiting for heist when u mention Mtgox. I don't understand your point. Bitcoin cannot be be counterfeited period. Fiat Ofcourse can be and always has been. Mt gox was a third party whom some ppl entrusted their money with. Too bad for them the company was defrauded and became insolvent. That's not fake money, it's money lost to thieves due to bad security...more like a heist from a bank vault....but not counterfeiting certainly...
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:08:52
Coz its cheap. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:03:38
The very fact that you can actually do this with bitcoins tells us how far superior it is, esp. when you consider WU and their enormous fees. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:13:32
Well you do own them, but they are locked in an online wallet held by MtGox. Once withdrawals are working, the price will shoot back up.

Long story short - 
Your public key is = bitcoin account number, 
Your address = is a shortened alias of your account number (that you can share with others). 
You private key = Like your password... Do not share this.. else any1 can spend your Money. 
I am sure you can find better and more elaborate explanations elsewhere on the net.

@_date: 2014-02-13 16:11:09
Bitcoin prices are still heavily news driven. When the big news turnover is low, interest dwindles, trading volumes slide and so do the prices because hoarders are done hoarding. Only the businesses that deal in BTC will keep trading volumes up. This continues until another major news breaks out...
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:48:19
Thanks! That is a very good explanation. So for routine transactions of typically &lt; 50$ worth 1 confirmation should suffice I guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:51:06
This is a good innovation, because sooner or later when the "tipping point" arrives, a lot of people  would have moved onto BTC already. I would imagine that in that world, retailers would need to show prices in both the currencies.

You missed the point. You can still get 900% if you just hold on to your bitcoin without betting. But if you bet it's 1000% including price of Berkshire stock. So it's not much of a gain really. But again, who knows if bitcoin could really become 1000% of current price. Most realistically it may at most just double or reach 2000s in my opinion within an year which makes this gamble worth considering.

I think this is a non-issue. The mining difficulty adjusts based on the total network hashing rate. So even if there was only 1 miner left in say 2015.... bitcoin would still be alive! Same like how Satoshi mined in the beginning of bit-time...

News driven market reaction is far better in comparision to insider trading and manipulation by the trustees that happens across all major stock exchanges. Bitcoin mining is not open to manipulation, while exchanges may falter but that's only a temporary problem.

I read somewhere last week that there is already someone offering 'bitcoin fixed deposits' for one year with an interest rate of 5% PA. Remember that currently bitcoin is still inflationary and shall continue to do so until 2040. Currently 3000 new coins are issued daily...and YoY inflation is abt 11%. Ofcourse 'we hope' that if bitcoin price goes to the moon....no1 would want to lend their money, but that's a bit naive.

Most sites using BTC required 3 confirmations, but now after the transaction malleability bug most need 6 confirmations. I thought that is a problem with the other coins too, but may be the block times are shorter on the alt ones which would mean even less security, methinks.

Why do you say there is no threshold ? If for example one issues 30k shares of 0.01 BTC each and assuming all get sold then he would have successfully raised the required 300BTC. And if the IPO flag is kept on, then the shares can't be traded. Ofcourse, to get people to trust you is another thing and that's your choice to not be an issuer of the security. Was just a suggestion to use that as a platform for crowd-funding.
