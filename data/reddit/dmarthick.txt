There may be some confusion with equating “financial collapse” with “end of civilization as we know it”.

It’s true.  But many previous months events have not been the same this year.  The bear has hold tight. I think there will be a rise of some sort between now and end year.  But who knows.  We may bear on for another year.  I’m pretty much 100% sure another will come tho. �� in time

Here’s a thought.  
Wait for it.  
No one knows! ��

Cartoons like this I get but to casual observers would reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is a cult.

I prefer no dollar symbol. Bitcoin and crypto is the alternative and antidote to fiat. Plus crypto is global. The $ perpetuates a Satoshi Link to a fiat symbology used by only a few, tho influential, countries.

I am Aussie too. I probably wouldn’t do this myself.... so there my disclaimer.... However, if you want some help i could buy you some BTC with your cash then Tfr it to your wallet or ledger.    IF there’s someone you trust you could do this.

I would give away 10-20% depending on amount. Continue to invest in crypto, housing and stocks. Continue to help financially secure my kids and grandkids future. Work less paid hours. Take some time out.  Mostly. I’d keep doing what I’m doing now but with greater freedoms.

2.5% net worth in for us. If u have a housing loan do u have any real savings? But if it moons I’d take our initial deposit plus some profit and put back in about 60% crypto profits which could equal approx 15% net worth at that stage- rinse repeat hopefully.
