It would, of course, have been true if you were talking log probability instead.

Then the creator of bitcoin is female. Um... I'm not entirely sure how that would affect things at all? (Or are you saying that in the attempts to solve who Satoshi really is, the assumption of he being a he was causing people to miss some obvious female candidates?)

Nitpick: Distributed in proportion to how much probability mass each of the remaining hypothesis already had, rather than evenly, no? (ie, so the relative odds remain unchanged)

What stops most of the usual financial instruments and institutions from being reinvented in a bitcoin flavor?
ie, even in a bitcoin economy, someone might want a loan. And given that demand, well, loaning with interest will become a thing. And given that, someone might say "hey, let's have interest bearing accounts, CDs, etc... with the interest paid by the loan business", and from there you get fractional reserve banking, tracking debts/negative balances, other abstracted financial instruments, etc...
And from there, looks like many of the abuses could potentially happen too. Not _all_ of the abuses, but it does seem like some of the issues could happen again. Or am I missing something? (I admit I'm certainly no econ or finance expert)

What's a quantum computer got to do with anything? Is there known to be  any quantum algorithms that'd usefully speed up breaking AES?
@_date: 2012-12-18 07:13:37
Ah, Grover's algorithm, whoops. Still, that only halves the number of bits, effectively. (an QC operations may themselves be slow.) It doesn't take it from exponential to polynomial difficulty or anything like that.

There's no proof even that classical computers can't solve NP complete problems in P time. However, QCs are not currently known to be able to solve NP complete problems in P time. (or, more precisely, NP is not known to be in BQP.)

That's not the issue. I was talking about the issue eimikion brought up, and noting it's potentially a general problem of bitcoin. If the value of a bitcoin keeps going up, why would I want to spend any "now" (for any possible now) when I could get more stuff for it by holding on to it and spending it later?
Eventually, if bitcoin survives, the value of a bitcoin is essentially a reflection of how much stuff you could buy with it. Since there will be, maximum, something like 20 million bitcoin ever, a bitcoin will always have value of at least 1/20 million of "sum of all stuff that can be gotten by bitcoin" essentially. If BTC goes into widespread mainstream use, then you end up with that total value being something like having growth proportional to, say, the global index, or the gdp of the nation with the most bitcoin users or something like that.
Don't misunderstand, I really do like the idea of bitcoin, I just think the "there's a fixed upper bound on the number of bitcoin that will ever exist" aspect is kind of a bad idea.

That very problem was pointed out to me as potentially an inherent problem with bitcoin. Only a finite number of bitcoins will ever exist, so as long as there's economic growth and as long as bitcoins keep being used/existing, they'll deflate.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:29:28
You might be right. (Though _IF_ bitcoin has the property of ultimately in the long run acting like "a share of the global index", then its deflation will correspond to market growth, which will strongly disincentivise any investing in other stuff.) Purchasing stuff that you need now, yes.
Although a bit of conversation did point out that I was mentally modeling bitcoin in an erroneous manner, so... depending on how other large scale trade ends up going, the long term deflation rate may be less severe even with constant economic growth.

A transaction has one confirmation of there's a block confirming it. A second confirmation if there's a second block confirming it (that is, a second block that continues the chain of the first block that confirmed the transaction) etc. ie, the more extended a blockchain that contains your transaction becomes, the more confirmed. (Since each additional block makes it that much harder for a fork or other issue to undo the transaction)
