Yes. And should've sold then too. Like I said, you can always get back in...


What a fucking idiot. You can never know when the top or bottom is. The point is that if you don't understand that 10X+ gain in 4 months is a good time to take profits, you are a fucking moron. Only a braindead imbecile doesn't understand the concept.


That's the point moron. It's impossible to pick tops or bottoms. That's why when you have a 10X increase in something, you take profits. 


It's not hindsight moron. It's investing 101. Only noobish morons don't understand it. If something increases in price 10 fold, you should take profits.


Like I said moron. Not hindsight. Weather it is apple stock, price of my home or bitcoins, if it increases 10 fold in 4 months, I will sell all or most of it. 100% of the time.

You are too stupid to understand my argument you dumb worthless cockroach. I'm not saying anything about volatility you fucking moron. I'm just poking holes in your idiotic argument - "Nothing about Bitcoin has changed since you bought.".
Yes nothing about bitcoin changed. So what? Nothing about bitcoin changed when it jumped from $85 to $1200. You dumb worthless shill.

The reality isn't worse you fucking moron. A world without FDIC is worse. There is a reason why the FDIC was created.


Sure. But the chances of every account holder withdrawing cash is 0. 


Do you know what oxymoron means moron? Jumbo shrimp != government corporation.


Amazing isn't. Wow, you know what everyone else knows. What's next? You are going to write the earth is spherical?


Amazing. You've yet to write anything insightful or interesting. Just basic nonsense. 


Not just FDIC insurance moron. ALL insurance of every kind. For example, during natural disasters, the government steps in and provides the "insurance".
I love worthless shills like you that know nothing and yet act like you know what you are talking about. In all your gibberish, you didn't quite explain the negative? 
In an extreme situation, the government steps in and the taxpayers collectively foot the bill. Nothing inherently wrong with that moron.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:18:50


Most, like you, get the gist of it. 


About what moron? 


No they don't you fucking worthless cockroach. The fed doesn't go around handing out cash to taxpayers...


And? 


You think janet yellen gets the money that the FED prints you jackass? Well if you want to join the FED then get nominated.


It isn't a group of oligarchs you fucking filth. It's a group of worthless jews like yourself. Funnily enough, bitcoins are peddle by jews as well.


Oh good, because that's how bitcoins works as well....................................
What a jackass.


Name calling? Stating obvious facts isn't name calling.
You haven't a clue what you are talking about because everything you know comes from silly "documentaries". You haven't an original thought in that tiny brain of yours. In one sentence you say the fed gives money to taxpayers. In another you claim they hand it out to their friends and family. Dumb ass cockroach...

What a fucking idiot. Learn about the FDIC. You are INSURED up to a limit on your bank deposits.


The bank could default and not pay ANYONE anything and you'd still be covered. Like I said, learn about the FDIC.
Typical retarded cockroach who doesn't know anything about anything. Fucking worthless shill.

Why? is exactly like a boiler room. Everyday there is a new submission that tells everyone not to sell their bitcoins. "You don't lose if you don't sell". "It's going to the moon!". There is always a savior. Overstock? Amazon? The chinese? Now wall street. That's pump and dump 101. Tell your "clients" not to sell because there is always hope while you sell out...


You have to understand that bruce fenton and many here on are shills with enormous financial stakes in bitcoin. They want to draw in as many people into bitcoin so that they can dump their bitcoins on the dentists with $300K. The idea is to transfer as much of their cash into the early adopters pockets. That's pump and dump 101 right there.
isn't here to educate you on bitcoin. exists to move cash from your pocket to some else's pocket...

But you didn't sell. So you have no profits. 


Noobish logic. Keep chasing moron. 


Look in the mirror pal. 
The only reason you are so defensive about me stating BASIC investing facts, is because you aren't doing so well.


Ah, pure noobish logic. There is always additional gains waiting for you. 
I'm done wasting my time with you. Most noobs who trade start off thinking like you. I certainly did back in the day. It's idiot's reasoning. Those who learn the basics quickly will make it. Morons like you who never learn get quickly tossed aside. For the final time, taking profits is not a bad thing moron. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:54:14


Are you retarded. Cbax1975 was referring to a parabolic spike. A parabolic spike is when smart people sell. You can always buy back in when the price drops. Also, it was the mother of all parabolic spikes. 


You are not smart enough to know that you should sell something when it's price jump more than 10X in a few months?
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:41:12


Right. That's what I said.


That's my point you worthless cockroach. 
If the price is 1000 or 500 or 10, that's just how the market works. YOU try to use the fact that nothing about bitcoin has changed as an argument that it would go back to 1200. YOU DUMB FUCKING COCKROACH.
That's what I was slamming you on you dumb shit. 


No moron. But are you going to tell it to go back to 1200 since NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH BITCOIN. YOU WORTHLESS COCKROACH.

The pumpers would have dumped long before it hits $10. It will be the bag holders that will cry out in agony.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:14:08
This is the type of garbage boiler rooms peddle to suckers everyday.
When it was at $1K, don't sell because it is going to $10K. It's never a good time to sell bitcoins right?


What's a "couple of years"? 3, 4, 10? Also, what will the price be in a "couple of years". 
Fucking worthless cockroach.
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:23:17


No you weren't you fucking moron. You are too stupid to understand what you wrote a few comments above. MY COMMENT WAS REFERENCING YOUR CONTRADICTION moron...
1. The bad part is the taxpayers get the money from a central group that just creates it.
2. This way no group gets to give their friends and family all the rewards.
In one part of your response, you claim that the feds prints money to give to taxpayers. Then you go on to claim the fed gives it to their family and friends. You dumb cockroach.


What a fucking idiot. Yes it is better to have a system where one person controls 5% of all bitcoins and a handful of people control over 50%. 


No you dumb cockroach. Those that got in earlier, CASH out and use CASH to buy "harder" assets. 


I know what the fed does you worthless filth. I don't need you to google and copy/paste. 


Why is quantitative easing in quotes moron? We already know who is benefiting you dumb cockroach.


Of course there is corruption you worthless filth. 


Fuck off you dumb shit. Go google and copy/paste some more. You are nothing but your typical worthless trash with superficial understanding of everything. You don't know what bitcoins are. You don't know how the fed works. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:00:03


But moron. You said that we don't know what the top or bottom is. Besides, like I said, YOU CAN ALWAYS BUY BACK IN. If you sell at $200 and the price drops to $20, YOU CAN BUY A WHOLE SHIT MORE...


You are surprised? Everything I've said should lead you to the opposite conclusion. I'd rather have ACTUAL gains of 10X rather than a POTENTIAL gain. "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"


From OP's post and the OP of this comment thread. Are you this fucking stupid? Follow this comment chain moron. Do you know what the parabolic rise means?


No moron. It's just that you can't even keep the topic of this thread straight. What a parabolic spike do you think this comment thread's OP was referring to you dumb cockroach?


There is no contradiction you dumb shit. It's BASIC investing. Point out the contradiction. I bet you can't.


It's the ONLY way to get rich moron. You don't get rich by NOT taking profits. Dumb shit. Basic investing 101. This applies to ALL investing and trading ( stocks, options, currencies, real estate, etc ). ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRICE JUMPS FROM $85 to $1200...
Dumb fucking shit. I can't believe the worthless shills that are attracted to bitcoins. Like flies to shit. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:43:52


You are the prototypical bag holder... 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:37:11


Ah the last defense of a moron who lost an argument. 


Look in the mirror pal. You are the epitome of a pure worthless trash.
It's like I'm telling you that the earth is round and you refuse to believe me. Everything I wrote is STANDARD investing. Taking profits is a good thing moron. Don't be afraid of it. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:29:56


Nothing about bitcoin changed when it jumped from $85 to $1200. So stop with your fucking bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:16:28


Of course they did. If they didn't sell, there wouldn't be any bitcoins to trade. Someone has to sell at $1200 and someone has to buy at $1200. Who do you think were selling? Smart money was dumping on morons.


Fundamentals? 


To make a profit moron.
