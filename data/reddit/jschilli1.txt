Uh.. yeah, preev is fine.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:23:53
can't tell if you're being snarky or not
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:16:58
So, this is actually good news?
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:08:50
hella generalization, i like it.
oh look, some random-ass flaw in an american system, americans are fucking idiots, right guys?
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:42:51
god this is retarded
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:31:17
So fucking circlejerk. This is how Apple does business, they don't hate Bitcoin. They want to keep a closed ecosystem with all payment functions going through them. Also, Apple phones only become usable after jailbreaking, everyone knows that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:51:15


That's all the explanation I needed.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:28:31
It just seems like this entire thread is "Apple hates Bitcoin! I hate Apple!", while Apple's really doing nothing new here. Anyways, most bitcoin users as of now are tech savvy and jailbreaking is painfully easy even if you aren't.
Whatever, I can understand your point of view and there's not much point in my arguing mine.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:35:19
yeah ok kid, there's idiots in every country.
dae hate america?!
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:53:34
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:02:39
thanks for the prophecy, let's see if it holds true.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:45:46
Their app would have been removed... get real.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:15:52
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:40:54
+10, what
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:56:27
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:48:44
Well, I guess I'm a "long time Bitcoin user", then. Cool.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:39:08
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:51:39
He's joking about BFL's "2 weeks" promises.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:15:55
i think you're delusional
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:00:13
For BTC, try bitstamp.net.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:47:35
awesome ty
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:40:04
Buy anything on the internet with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:48:54
Use them to buy shit online, just use SnapCard.
Edit: unless you meant 32,000
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:58:54
Don't. The golden days of mining are over. :(
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:32:11
Yeah, OP posted a link to the Spanish blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:53:20
Hahaha. Knew somebody would say that.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:05:59
Hope not.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:11:06
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:01:41
wow this exists
dunno if i like the whole 'anon' vibe though
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:50:13
fuck the haters xD
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:18:10
Because OP is foreign?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:36:37
It's been around for a while. They don't track you.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:06:31
Why do you frequent shitty subreddits? There's a whole new world of reddits out there for you to discover, and that way you won't have to complain near as much.
@_date: 2013-02-04 20:48:43
Targeted ads.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:21:39
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:09:21
Jailbroken devices say hi.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:48:33
Transaction cost can be free...
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:23:55
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:46:29
Then use Coinbase. Or Blockchain. Or Electrum. Jesus.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:34:27
Just hope it doesn't keel over.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:40:37
anonymous is legion!
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:21:34
The blockchain would get huge. Why do you think the limit's there?
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:05:11
Nope, you can as long as you have the IPA.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:52:29
I don't think that's how most OSS versioning works. .10 sounds like the next step after .9.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:37:19
And after, it would go 1.1, 1.2 ... 1.9, 1.10?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:33:40
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:29:08
...uh yeah
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:45:07
It's common sense. The blockchain is a log of all bitcoin transactions. If there were, say, 5,000 per second, it would get very large.
Obviously, right now we're nowhere close to that number. The point still stands.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:19:56
No, it isn't.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:35:50
lmao tell that to the producers
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:29:21
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:48:21
obvi troll is totes obvi
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:27:52


No, my sandwich cost me the same today as it did yesterday.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:10:36
Are you thinking of MoneyPak?
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:30:06
i just discovered 4chan last week too
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:08:40
what a vet
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:34:00
Then use Electrum.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:04:56
They're both rogue agencies for the most part, I doubt they do.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:03:46
Oh, I know, I was just seeking a bit of clarification on what he actually meant.
Probably shouldn't have implied that my way is the 'right way'.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:36:43
