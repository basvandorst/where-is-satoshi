could you see the personal benefit of people getting negative interest rates to buy a house? I’m not saying it’s better than bitcoin but as a world reserve the dollar can be packaged with wrapping paper and a bow.

my question is from a hypothetical stand; what happens if the halving takes place in 2020 and global demand for bitcoin goes down regardless of scarcity?

people are so scared of margin and leverage because they haven’t built and backtested strategies around leverage before. It is definitely in everyone’s best interest to learn how margin can create a more efficient portfolio that can still stand a stress test and have a positive expected return. For instance, leveraged bond funds can create higher returns at a lower beta than the market.

I can agree with that but when I say annual returns I’m referring to in places other than bitcoin. (8%/year in index funds, dividends, etc..).

yep! the leverage of my short futures positions has my delta exposure of my overall portfolio almost flat and my large equity positions are all collared with puts for safe exit points. Adding bitcoin to 5% of my portfolio will also hopefully reduce the volatility in a bear equity market.

word of advice. There’s absolutely no need to risk losing any bitcoin by trying to find a good bitcoin hustle on the internet. You’ll have much better returns over the years if you just buy and hold!
