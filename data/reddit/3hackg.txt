99% same code is essentially the same code and this doesn't suddenly make it decentralized because it has bigger blocks.  
Bitcoin Cash is very centralized compared to Bitcoin - 97% of the blocks are being mined by a single "unknown" mining entity and these block rewards (newly minted BitcoinCash coins) are ending up in 1 of 2 addresses

So its not just that BTC2 will have issues with transactions from BTC1 able to be replayed on it... BTC1 will also be in jeopardy of transactions from BTC2 being replayed on it? Doesn't this just make both chains incredibly insecure to invest / hold funds on?  
Surely BTC2's developer would know this in advance, so is this just a way to take down both chains? 
Like "hey I'll make a coin that I'll know will be like suicide and I'll take down Bitcoin1 chain with us"... if This developer is invested in BitcoinCash it would sound like quite the conspiracy story

Some people don't have enough fiat to buy that much bitcoin so for many it is a great strategy to increase the fraction of a full bitcoin you have. Once you have a full coin I would agree its best to let that sucker grow on its own and focus any new fiat on some other fav coins. Bitcoin to me is one of the lesser exciting coins but it will always be the great beast that it is and a must have for all crypto fans

His hotmail address was in the header of the welcome email sent out to new users who signed up to the forum! Plain as day! He changed it early on to fix that, but once there were several emails out there in the wild with that header info, it was a clue waiting for LE to come across... which they did, and got his IP and name

OMG what an idiot, look how they first caught on to him - he had his personal hotmail address in the header of the welcome email for the forum signup! Wow, rookie move there

Where are the photos of your setup, solar panels, miners and all? I don't see any proof that what you claim you have setup over there even exists.. I'm willing to remain open minded though - let me know when you update your post with photos (unless you mean to say you have solar panels, bitcoin miners, but no cell phone camera)

I don't believe there is any risk of PoW change... any talk about it is akin to trying to fight someone by pulling their socks down. Won't do much  
and the discussion won't go anywhere serious

I agree - don't put $2,500 in 1 BTC, spread that money over BTC, LTC, etc. I would spread it out over 5-8 of the top performing coins and look at the total portfolio. Some days a coin or two may drop but the majority should rise over time, thereby rising your total portfolio value. Diversify works well in crypto, not just stock market advice
