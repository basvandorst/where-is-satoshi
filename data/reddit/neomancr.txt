It's all obviously such a cover just to rob people. The media have all already decided to portray the allegations as completely true as usual. 
“BTC-e’s system was designed so that criminals could accomplish financial transactions with anonymity and thereby avoid apprehension by law enforcement or seizure of funds,” the indictment says, pointing out that BTC-e only required “a username, password, and an email address,” unlike “legitimate payment processors or digital currency exchangers.” The indictment also points to suspicious usernames like “ISIS,” “CocaineCowboys,” “blackhathackers,” “dzkillerhacker,” and “hacker4hire” as additional support for the money-laundering allegations.
That's the spin they're putting out. That everyone who had an account deserved to have their money stolen because they were all criminals with suspicious user names.  
It's like when Prosper was attacked for bypassing the banking system and allowing people to loan money directly to one another. They couldn't have that and accused the lending practices of breaching discrimination laws because some people were being passed over for loans for being ugly.   
The fact that all it took was allegations to steal millions of dollars from completely innocent people should not be so easy.      
It's well known that for decades billions of dollars have been are still are laundered through Wallstreet and that's considered a good thing since stock prices would drop without the stimulus. 
There have been articles about it for most of our entire life times that anyone can Google any day. It's not even a secret.        And it goes as far as you want with records dated back to the 70s at least.   
The American dollar has been the medium of money laundering. The allegation is purely a polical device. 
Would anyone create a btc e account to launder money? Sure. Would the feds do it to steal millions of dollars?
