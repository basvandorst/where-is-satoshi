That's the thing, I had 1 transaction where I recieved 370$, I sent 367$ to a different person and while that transaction was pending in my history all of a sudden both transactions in my history disappeared aswell as the remaining 3$ I had in my wallet, as if those transactions never happened. But I did 100% have the money in my wallet previously because how else would I be able to send money and it said that I had 370$ in my wallet, but its like the person who send me the money took it back which resulted in both of those transactions ''never happening'' and just being removed from my history, but if the money was in my wallet there shouldn't be a way for that person be able to take it back right? 
So, no, I can't provide a screenshot of recieving the money, its as if this person sent me fake money or something, so weird and annoying..

How do you know it will be confirmed in 1-2 hours? I have already waited for about 11.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:30:49
What do you mean by the source address, as in my address? because I don't have it, how am I suppost to send it again if I don't have the money returned to my account?
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:04:13
Which means what? It won't get confirmed? I just sent an amount to 1 person so I don't know why.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:15:33
I tried it and there is still nothing there. No, i dont have any transactions there, I had 2 before, the one that I recieved and the one I'm talking about now which was pending, after a while after sending the transaction and while it was still 0/3 in pending my transaction history suddently went blank and nothing was there, aswell as the remaining 3$ that I had on my account but I just assumed that those 3$ went to fee or something, really weird and I don't know how ill get my money back :/
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:23:03
I didn't put a fee manually though? I just put in the amount to send and the remaining money (3$) from my wallet got taken out, does that mean that a fee exists?
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:08:59
Alright, thanks. I'll see if the money pops up then.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:49:38
Thanks for your help but it still says I have 0 :/ Feels like the money is  still ''stuck'' in the the transaction or something, I have no idea :/
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:33:45
I noticed that the money on the transaction is more than I had in my wallet, maybe thats the problem? I initially sent 370$ and had 3$ left in my account (now 0$ left) but on the transaction the amount is higher, I don't know why. I would appreciate it alot if you tried to help me!
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:16:54
This seems to be the case, and if it is then this person has already ran away with that money :/ Don't understand how money can appear in my wallet if its not confirmed yet, it should only appear when it's 100% my money and I'm pretty sure that it says on the site that you can't get back money which is already sent and confirmed.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:46:10
I didn't pay any attention to the transaction I recieved, I just saw that the money appeared in my wallet and assumed that it was mine, becasuse why would it else appear there?
@_date: 2017-04-09 01:03:28
I've imported to electrum aswell and the transaction does not show up anywhere anymore. I'm pretty sure that I indeed do not have the money and won't get it back because if you look at my address that I sent the money from it says that I've never had nor sent any money, ever and the 2 transactions that previously were in my history (the one that I recieved money and the one that I sent which was pending) are now gone, completely blank. I did however have 370$ on my account that got sent to me and that I saw in my wallet, and how would I be able to send money if I didn't have any? But it's like the money that got send to me got unconfirmed (even after appearing in my wallet and after me sending it) and returned to the person who sent it which shouldn't at all be possible and is complete bullshit.

My account is pretty new so I don't think I ever got/made a 12 word recovery phrase :/ But i don't understand what this will do? I'm already logged into the account that I had my money on previously.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:28:22
I just tried and it said ''transaction does not exist''
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:16:19
I'm using blockchain. I've read elsewhere that people have said that it might take days, weeks or even that it will almost never get returned/confirmed, this is what scared me and why I posted this. I can handle waiting 3 days but is there any proof that it will 100% be returned at that time? Thanks for helping me by the way.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:32:28
I'm not sure how it works but I had the bitcoins in my account. Doesn't it require to be confirmed for it to appear in my account? If not then that might be the issue.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:13:31
Because I don't see the money in my wallet and there is nothing in the history, but im not 100% sure. 
I'm not sure what you mean by origin bitcoin address but ill provide a  screenshot of how the transaction looked before it got denied, maybe its on there:
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:26:49
Does the reciever have to confirm it aswell for the money to go through? Because I sent the money to a site called opskins.com and it had a 15 minute limit for you to send the money and by the time 15 minutes had gone the transaction was not confirmed yet.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:46:38
Ok, thanks. Just one more question, after I sent the money my send and receive history suddently went completely blank when it previously was 2 transactions there, at the same time the remaining 3 dollars I had left also disappeared but since my transaction is still "pending" even though it's not in my history I shouldn't have to worry about this? Maybe it's a bug on the site and maybe the 3$ went towards the fee? Or should I take something away from this?
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:24:17
Your link didn't work for me btw
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:32:37
What do you mean by sending the money to a different wallet? How can I send the money if it doesn't appear on my blockchain account? or you mean connecting my wallet ID to a different wallet?
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:43:16
Nope, still same :/
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:25:13
Quite quickly, like 1 hour probably.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:50:32
blockchain, the history of my transaction doesn't even show up there ever since I sent it.
