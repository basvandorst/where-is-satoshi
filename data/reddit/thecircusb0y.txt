Heat, my bitmining rigs are heating my apartment up nice and toasty for these chilly nights. 
I plan to find GPU water blocks, so I can use the heat generated by the mining rigs to heat cold water input into the hotwater heater, or maybe with a heat exchanger into a tub for a hot tub . :-)

I bitmine because it's cheaper on electricity than my space heater. 
I guess I also hope that one day the exchange rate is stupidly high. 
Come spring/summertime, I don't know if I'll still be mining.

You um, you have to explain why his logic is flawed. That's how these discussions work. Unless that was your last bit of ammunition. In which case, I think you just lost the debate.

Prizes don't credit anybody anymore, Not after Obama got a nobel peace prize for wishing peace in the middle east, and then carpet bombs Libya.

I didn't know libertarianism and bitcoin we're mutually exclusive; Let alone do I feel that there are any true libertarians in government that have power. 
I do agree that the politicians will have to change with America, but they're still just as deceptive. Look at this past week with the gay marriage activism at the federal level, while the Monsanto Protection Act was signed through; It's sick. 
I think the "justice" is that Bitcoin is taking off with every government action to regulate virtual currencies (or try) and or subject the people to robbery on the bank accounts.
