If I paid for it, I'd probably feel inclined to "get my money's worth."
Furthermore, who pays for something with so many ads?

It was a level playing field without the license.

Just out of curiosity do you recommend Cyanogen?
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:59:29
I love that there's a word for this.
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:20:28
I agree, but I also think something like a billboard or tv commercial might be effective as well. Maybe a paid search campaign...

I've literally heard of the same shit being promoted elsewhere. It's like some old guys hear about bitcoin and think it would be better if it was backed by a central authority such as Delta. Then they think they've come up with a revolutionary idea.

It's a little table.

And soon we will hear the constant jeers of the international media, "Lazy Americans! Notorious tax dodgers! You brought this unpayable debt upon yourselves!"
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:16:29
Then they enslave us.

You don't have to assume, they said in plain English: Facebook is the leading social network, not "Facebook is unbeatable."
Go back to your troll cave.

We don't know how magnets work; your argument is ridiculous (I'm not even sure what you're arguing). 
I just wanted to mention that Circle and Coinbase are the reason I recently got into bitcoin after hearing about it for years.

It's infinitely divisible.

I agree with email, but I feel like porn was traded on irc forever-ago.

I downvoted because the comment was an insult sandwich. Not bad otherwise.

First they wrote checks.

It would be cool to run a political party this way, or a direct democratic government.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:29:34
I suddenly want to buy a lot of bitcoin. All the cool kids are doing it.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:22:44
Don't keep them under your mattress.
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:51:20
Then this becomes a semantic argument. Regardless, I think you can understand their meaning. It's certainly not the first time this argument has been made.

I agree with you, but there are adults using bitcoin today who were babies when that book came out.
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:34:28
Could bitcoin nodes be run on a mesh network?

Seriously, this is the level of their readership, people:
