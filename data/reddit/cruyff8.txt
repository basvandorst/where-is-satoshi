It's possible iff the other side of the transaction accepts it; I don't see why it wouldn't be.

There are a [few escrow services for cryptocurrency]( As I don't use it very much to pay for stuff directly (opting instead to convert it to fiat currency, before using it), I can't be any help in a recommendation one way or another. I'm sure others will though, and I'd defer to them.

Advising denizens present, the site is in Chinese. Not sure if it's legit or not, as I can't read Chinese.

Having a few manufacturers gets each economics of scale, which drive down production costs. It may be more competitive, but profit won't be too high for each participant in the market and there is a temptation to merge. When taken to its logical conclusion, you get the status quo.

The US (and other fiat currencies) are designed to be depreciating at a low rate by default. Bitcoin is designed in the opposite way.
When viewed in this sense, the USD is functioning as intended, going down in value over time at a consistent rate. BTC, however, doesn't universally appreciate, indeed it fluctuated [approximately 10%]( in the last 24-hours alone.

Volume in trading is related to volatility, which seems to [correlate to negative price swings]( I don't think this is Bitcoin (or even crypto) specific, but just a general feature of any marketplace.

Profits become real when you sell an instrument. Until then, they are mythical.

They do respond, just seem to have a pretty severe case of attention deficit disorder. In that, they tend to lose interest after 1-2 messages.
