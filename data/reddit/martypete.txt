the point i was making was, you're trying to say that Bitcoin security is the same as someones private key security. They are two different things. The network is secure but if your private keys are not well secured, then your funds should be moved to an address that has not been compromised. This may have been what happened with these guys moving their 50BTC

Its hardly a trick. The stipulations are clearly outlined. if you dont like the price you are being offered, then nothing is stopping you from finding a different phone to trade in....
Also I wanna clarify how this works. The money you receive up front for trade in merely satisfies the requirement for us to pay for your ETF. the full ETF amount is reimbursed on the back end in the form of a prepaid mastercard, up to $350, regardless of what phone is traded in at the point of sale

the block reward was 50 when bitcoin first started. most people were solo mining, so many wallets had even deposits of 50 BTC for a long time. the reason they have not moved, is that many miners lost or forgot about their wallet keys long ago. gotta remember, even at the $750~ for a single bitcoin price were at today, one must remember there was once a time when 50 BTC were collectively worth less than a penny.

okay. lets say you have decent credit. Galaxy s4, $26/month for installment. $70 for fully unlimited (no throttling) and $10 for the Assurant insurance which comes with JUMP. JUMP allows you to basically start your phone installments over every 6 months on a new phone! WITH all this youre looking at $106 before tax. ATT and verizon both would be able to get you a 4GB data plan with unlimited talk and text for $110 monthly before tax, then you have to sign a 2 year contract, so $100-200 up front for the phone. then insurance is 8$... edge and next program are even more expensive and confusing. trust me if t-mo is available in your area you should at LEAST check it out.
EDIT: The installment term is 24 months, zero% financing zero% interest, and should you NOT JUMP to a new phone and keep yours for the 24 months, your 26$ installment disappears and you have a lower monthly bill . employer discounts range from 10-15% and they apply to all plan charges with the exception of installments which arent technically usage charges but finance installments. that means anywhere from 12$-$15 off if you work for any decently large corporation!

~900 people own over half of all Bitcoins. The wealth distribution in the Bitcoin world is even worse than the fiat world.
there are estimates that 30%-40% of those coins belong to wallets whose keys have long been lost or forgotten about. BTC used to be worth less than pennies. on a side note, wealth distribution does not bother me with regards to a fixed, steady, deflationary money supply. capitalism will still direct wealth to the hard working and profit motivated.
EDIT: if you knew ANYTHING about bitcoin, you would have not posted this statement because you would understand that bitcoin ADDRESSES containing bitcoins does not necessarily mean someone holds the private keys to use them. many of those keys are lost forever, rendering your argument far less credible, if not discredited. but thanks for trolling.

 "A Thorough Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Secure Paper Wallets (w/ An Online Component to Monitor Your Balance 24/7)"
EDIT: OP claims "digital security needs to be fixed". I disagree. What needs to be fixed is people's addiction to "convenience" and their understanding that security is inversely proportional to convenience. Meaning, the easier something is to get to, then it is inherently more insecure. Fortunately, this was a relatively inexpensive lesson for OP. ~$1,500 is not a grand sum compared to some of the hackings ive seen on I saw a guy lose 36 BTC a few weeks aso which is what motivated me to write this tutorial on cold storage. 
People always say the reason they dont use cold storage is convenience. OP couldve easily had 1.5 BTC in a paper wallet (printed securely offline) with encrypted private keys that have NEVER been on the internet. and 0.4 BTC in his hot wallet. and this lesson would've costed $1100 dollars less. Should the need arise for you to immediately need more than $400, all you need to do is get to a computer or file cabinet (wherever you have your encrypted keys stored), scan your private key, enter your passphrase to decrypt it, and sweep it to your hot wallet. takes the total of time it takes to get to your house + 5 seconds. not a big deal to make sure your BTC is secure.
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:07:03
This is the correct answer. I am but at most a novice user of bitcoin. I generate secure keys offline using a linux distro and github repo of bitaddress.org. I keep my hot and cold addresses bip38 encrypted with different passphrases. Used to use blockchain android app all the time no problem, then the update.
So, first thing I notice, multiple input TX's. Sweet. first android wallet that I knew of that did that (now know mycelium will do multiple input TX's as long as all keys are present)
But no BIP38 sweep, no import. almost had a heart attack trying to decode my cold storage --&gt;&gt;
Moved to mycelium and never looked back

@_date: 2014-08-28 17:18:12
easy, someone points a gun in your face.
EDIT: in the heat of the heist, hopefully the thief getting just a fraction of your bitcoins (while convinced that you DID indeed keep them all on that single wallet) leaves you alone, with still a large portion of your money still safe. always a good idea to split up wallets. This obviously only applies to people with considerable BTC net worth. Unlike myself...

i find it hard to believe that an android would not have the same capability to sync your DSLR shots. In fact, the Galaxy S4 and the Note 3 come with a 2 year 50GB dropbox subscription as a promo. Dropbox is an app that automatically syncs your photos as soon as you take them, and you normally only get like 2GB instead of 50GB. i would definitely look more into it.

So i buy BTC from a buddy of mine every now and then. The cheap bastard never includes a fee. However, I know he's good for it. What I do is I create a new wallet for him to send it to first, and then I send that BTC to *another* address, and attach a fee to the 2nd transaction. This usually gets both transactions confirmed on the next block.
My question: If some random person were to do this, send me a TX with no fee, but then lets say hes nefarious and he then transfers all his BTC out of that same address with a fee, and that second transaction gets confirmed, does the first one to me just stay unconfirmed forever? and I would have basically been screwed? am I correct in how all this works?

@_date: 2014-01-04 02:01:21
normally you would have to "sweep" the private key into another wallet and designate a change address for any funds leftover. because this shit confuses me, i use the blockchain android app.
It allows you to send from a paper wallet the same way you would from a hot wallet, it just requires you to scan the QR code for your private key, as blockchain app would have no way of knowing it otherwise, because it has never been used. Once you use that key, blockchain automatically sweeps the key for you, and then dumps the change right back into the paper wallet.
At this point, this wallet is no longer considered cold storage (bc the private key has been exposed to the internet) so most people would THEN do a second transaction to sweep the leftover funds to another one of your paper wallets, one whos private key has not ever been used, aka Bacon02 from the article above^^

well theres 2 ways to do it, if you "sweep" the funds using the blockchain wallet app for android, it charges 0.0005 BTC by default, which is alot considering i want to pay the least fee possible. 
If you do a "custom send" then you can send exactly the amount you want and manually attach a .00000001 fee (the least amount possible) instead of the 0.0005 that comes out automatically when you "sweep" a private key. same end result, the coins are moved, except one way lets you keep 0.00049999 BTC in your pocket.
EDIT: After doing this custom send, you have input the private key into your device, blockchain automatically deposits the change right back into the same wallet, but this wallet is now considered "hot" and needs to be treated as if it were compromised, which is why i reccomend after every transaction from a paper wallet i would immediately transfer that remaining change balance to one of your other cold wallets whose private key has never been used

you're completely omitting and disregarding the BTC already in circulation. The fact that the amount of coins mined per day will drop from 4000 to 2000 per day will have little effect on an economy that will have 14+ million BTC in circulation at the time of the halving. The only thing that will happen is that scarcity and value of BTC will both increase their rate of growth, assuring increased purchasing power and lower prices denominated in BTC

Coinbase is an exchange. On the spectrum of risky to secure, storing your coins on an exchange is historically the riskiest. Coinbase claims to be different in that they store 90% of your funds in offline paper wallets inside bank vaults, but as long as your coins are on an exchange, they are nothing more than promises, and that involves you trusting the exchange to not get hacked, pack up and bounce with your coins, etc.
I buy my coins with coinbase, when the coins are in my coinbase acct, i go directly to the Send/Request page on the left hand side of the main page, then click SEND MONEY on the top right. Enter the amount of BTC you want to take out of coinbase (i always withdraw my entire amount) to your paper wallet public address. 
Coinbase also has a feature to automatically export your coins to a printable paper wallet, but once again that method is not secure enough to my liking. I know once my coins arrive in my paper wallet address, they are mine forever.
EDIT: Coinbase also operates as a merchant tool, meaning that it will allow you to accept bitcoin, but once again using this carries the same risk of using a hot wallet. when you send bitcoin to their wallet, that is a hot wallet that can be compromised if a hacker has the right tools. all the Blockchain does, with the "watch only"addresses on the other hand, is reference to my coins so i know my balance, but has no way of knowing the private key to spend them

If it's by a private entity, then yes. He is merely trying to keep people from becoming disenchanted with BTC because of an exchanges bad practices.

It most likely won't have the dramatic effect you think, if he is in the US, unless his class is full of global businessmen or migrant workers. we're so spoiled with how good we have it here (ESPECIALLY 19-20 yr olds) easy access to banking, and operating in the closed little box that is the U.S., that no one cares if you can send money across the world, because a large majority have never needed to =\ college kids are too busy caring about sex, booze, sports, and celebrities. 
EDIT: not dissing college kids, just saying they have other things that are priorities for them. I don't think you really start caring about economics or things like bitcoin until your eyes have been opened a bit to the way things are in the real world, apart from academia.

**WHAT IS A BITCOIN ADDRESS?**
A bitcoin "Address" is nothing more than a pairing of a public key (which you share with people to receive money, think of your public key as INBOUND ONLY traffic) and a private key (which cryptographically links to your public key, allowing you to spend said funds, OUTBOUND traffic). As im sure most of us would have no issue with money accidentally coming INTO our account, your public address can be shown to anyone. However, to spend/move those funds, you must possess the PRIVATE key. this is why they are named as such.
an address is a randomly generated pair of keys, one public for receiving funds, and one private for spending.
**OKAY, SO WHAT IS A KEY, AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?**
Okay, this one is going to make you techies cringe. Key pairs are generated using complex codes and algorithms and javascript and shit, and these algorithms basically spit you out two keys. One is short, and that is your public key. the other is long, that is your private key, which allows you to spend funds.
The public key is mathematically derived from the private key.
Now i know what you're thinking, Dafuq? Couldnt someone just take my public key, plug it into a reverse key generator, and determine my private key, and then spend my coins?? Well this is where the genius of bitcoin comes into play:
Your public key is derived in such a way that, if someone wanted to reverse math your public key to find your private key, it would take the worlds most powerful computer something like 43928409382490832904839028490328 years to perform the calculation, because math. Boom.
keys are generated mathematically using complex algorithms, and shit.

i appreciate your honest answer. you know one time i almost sent 1 bitcoin instead of $1.00? the only thing that saved me was the fact that I was using a watch only cold storage address for 95% of my funds, so instead of sending $600+ dollars by mistake, it comes back with insufficient funds. Download the blockchain chrome browser if you must use it on a desktop. use the blockchain app if possible, and use cold storage, "watch only addressses"!

if you make another transaction with a fee from the unconfirmed address, that may speed along the confirmation. what i mean is: buddy sends me X BTC with zero fee, is unconfirmed, but right after, i send that unconfirmed money to another of my own address with the default fee. since they link to each other, in the blockchain, if the latter tx confirms, so does the earlier one. i could be completely wrong, but that has happened to me.

the point is, all the information is out there. you just google bitcoin and read about it. read the wiki. watch videos, read articles, read tutorials, create a wallet, send some money, print some paper wallets, read about encryption, THEN go over to macroeconomics, read about inflation, quantitative easing, monetary policy, counterparty risk, derivatives, naked short selling.
THEN, you may postulate a question without being ridiculed, because it will be an informed question. but like ive said before, when we see the posts like "derp whats stopping me from just making more bitcoins" its just a facepalm to absolute maximum, and it gets old.
There is a reason the FAQ is in GIANT GREEN LETTERS on the front page and clearly says READ BEFORE POSTING.

The only thing you are using your smartphone for is to monitor your balance using your "watch only" addresses (your public paper wallet addresses) thru your blockchain app.
If you do not have a smartphone with the blockchain app, you can still monitor your balance by creating a bookmark to 
blockchain.info is just an app that references your paper wallet on the blockchain, which is what basically tells you how much money is in your address.
has i know the best way to do it would be to just use Blockchain.info's online wallet at  , or even install their chrome extension ( for added security. you can add your "watch only" addresses using your PC, but you will have to copy and paste them from a PDF file that you print right after generating your keys. I would not reccomend manually inputting your public keys EVER. one wrong number or letter and youre sending your shit to a completely different address.

Just because its legal, doesn't mean it's not fraud. They are claiming to have more money deposited than they actually do. IE mtgox. So the logic goes: when banks are allowed to create money out of thin air, its perfectly legal, but when you or I do it, it's counterfeiting.

i agree, hence why i say, in this case, there have been enough complaints about BFL to warrant a lawsuit. Businesses have 1 job. deliver on a promise. whether it involves a timeframe, a product, or both, it is still one job. BFL has proven repeatedly that they cannot do their job, which is provide pre-ordered miners that perform as described within the timeframe expressed in the original order. Did you miss the fact that they did not even show up to court?

you make it seem like gaining control of 51% of the Bitcoin network is some run-of-the-mill task. the bitcoin network has more computing power than the worlds top 500 supercomputers combined. Also, if you DID have this type of computing power, you'd make way more by actually just mining, rather than trying to break the protocol, and effectively ruining the integrity of the money you just stole. Think about it.

you are mistaken sir. There is not enough money in cicrulation to pay the debts of everyone. If by "the money just keeps going around the system" you mean keep creating deposits out of thin air, to pay the interest on the PREVIOUS debts that were created out of thin air, then yes that is how it works. that is why the fed is printing a good $1Trillion a year in legally counterfeited money. because the economy is grinding to a halt as everyone in the world works to pay off their debts. This encourages printing and spending policy.
bitcoins on the other hand are created on a value basis. meaning that the block rewards are rewarded based on providing value to the economy by mining, securing, verifying, and propagating transactions. So the economy is value based, rather than debt based which results in the small financial elite who have the power to create money out of nothing having control of the entire world. This results in saving, normal interest rates, and free flowing capital.

if you trust coinbase's security enough to have them print you a paper wallet, i would assume it would be just the same if you kept it with them on a hot wallet. i trust my blockchain wallet more than coinbase, so other than my paper wallets, i keep my spare BTC on my blockchain hot wallet.

the BIP38 encryption protects you against this. it's why the BIP38 protocol was created in the first place. with BIP38 wallets, you can literally walk up and put your wallets in a thief's back pocket, and know that your funds aren't going anywhere.

that means if you would like to save $10 per month, we can slow you down to 2G speed after you have used 2.5GB of data. If you'd like to save $20 per line you could get throttled at 500MB of hi-speed data. Its all about how you use your phone. some people can absolutely use less than 500 MB of data and therefore reap the benefits. Other people like me, who watch many many youtube videos, would benefit from paying the extra $10 for 2.5GB of hi-speed data or the extra $20 for fully unlimited no throttled hi-speed data =D

Maybe they shouldn't have let someone control their private keys. The whole point of bitcoin is eliminating the third party risk.

You are completely mistaken on how this works. I work for t-mobile. I do this daily. Its hardly a trick. The stipulations are clearly outlined. if you dont like the price you are being offered, then nothing is stopping you from finding a different phone to trade in....
Also I wanna clarify how this works. The money you receive up front for trade in merely satisfies the requirement for us to pay for your ETF. the full ETF amount is reimbursed on the back end in the form of a prepaid mastercard, up to $350, regardless of what phone is traded in at the point of sale

The law needs to be enforced universally. Cops are never held to the same standard as the laws they enforce, nor do they enforce them fairly (ie targeting black people, letting cute girls off with warnings in situations where they would have otherwise been arrested) GTFO of here with your knee-jerk statist cliche retorts. Stop blindly following the law and learn to distinguish right from wrong. People like you are literally the scum of society and the reason we have mass genocides still happening today.

i guess a good point would be, if you're in the market for a cellphone, but you pass up buying the phone in hopes of buying a better, more valuable one next year, but then that model gets released, and you pass up THAT phone because you think your dollars might get you even MORE in the NEXT year. fortunately, this doesnt happen, as eventually you just need to bite the bullet and buy the god damn cell phone. 
People still have to buy things, regardless of how deflationary the actual currency or product happens to be.

the payments are made quite quickly, pretty much instantly. what you are talking about is a confirmation of a transaction into a block, which on average happens every 10 minutes.
what it comes down to isrisk reward, the risk of someone trying to double spend on a bar tab is much much lower than the risk that patrons will be annoyed with having to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation before they know their transaction has gone through, so i think most merchants will just absorb the risk.

i dont think it will always be like this. we are still very early adopters. you used to have to memorize a shit ton of numbers for websites, before DNS protocol was introduced.. as far as i understand. the more adoption we have the more innovations we will see in the field of wallets and safeguarding coins.

I personally switched to Mycelium after updating the blockchain app and trying to load my BIP38 keys, and almost shitting myself because they wouldnt decrypt. turns out it was a bug.
Mycelium is cool because they use Deterministic wallets, meaning that you get a new address for every transaction and if you just memorize a 12 word seed then you have your entire wallet backed up in your BRAIN. WAY better IMO
There have also been instances where the blockchain.info block explorer has been wrong on confirmations, propagation, etc and ive had to use

That's interesting. I guess I never saw a reason to transfer coins INTO coinbase just to send them somewhere when I could just create the transaction myself with mycelium. I'm would assume you are a very small minority whose coins spent from CB are not directly purchased from CB.

Glad you asked. Being able to print and create money out of nothing, and loan it at interest, dilutes your purchasing power. It is effectively LEGAL counterfeiting. you have more and more pieces of paper chasing a fixed amount of goods, and a fixed amount of those pieces of paper chasing interest repayments that technically do not exist yet!

i cannot believe with all the reports of hacking, compromised accounts, etc, there are still people storing 36+ BTC (more than a years salary for many people) in a hot wallet. The only way to truly secure your BTC is a BIP38 cold storage paper wallet, printed securely using an offline bitaddress html page from github. i dont have anywhere near this amount of bitcoin and i take as many security precautions as i can. sorry for your loss, and i would just take it as a very expensive lesson.
EDIT: this story motivated me to write a very thorough tutorial on paper wallets, check it out here   ["A Thorough Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Secure Paper Wallets (w/ An Online Component to Monitor Your Balance 24/7)"]( we need to get a serious handle on the amount of BTC lost due to irresponsible coin storage. it is putting out a negative stigma for the people considering getting on board with BTC. if everyone handled their coins responsibly, it could increase worldwide adoption much more quickly.

went ahead and included it. I've heard some scary stories about true crypt not decrypting correctly, and thats just too much for me to bear, if a hacker can find out not only the fact that you have a wallet to begin with, then hack your cloud server, then hack the BIP38, then he deserves your money. =D

Already did, called my bank right after and they said it was refused on your guys' end. Not really sure where to go from here, the chat support is completely useless, and  everytime I reach out via email I get no resolution, so if your suggestion is to do the same thing again, I'm not sure the outcome will be any different.

I love how every single and I mean every single person that hears about bitcoin Thinks theyre the only one who has ever thought that mining is a good idea. When you think about buying gold or silver do you first think about dropping a few hundred grand in a rig and going into the foothills of the mountains? No, you just buy it. Mining is not profitable, especially for someone who knows nothing about Bitcoin. and unless you want to lose a s*** ton of money, ask any person who tried to get into mining back in October and November and they will tell you they would have made way more money buying and holding Bitcoin.

the ETF will be reimbursed up to $350. so the answer to your question of how hard you will have to fight, should be: not at all.
SOURCE: 
"What if the value of my phone is $0?
You can still qualify for the full ETF reimbursement. To qualify for this promotion, you need to trade in a phone or device, even if the trade-in value is $0."

because none of you do ANY research without posting dumb ass questions that have already been answered time and time again over the last 5 years.
EDIT: it would be one thing if people who didn't know shit posted legitimate questions, but the questions by people who know nothing about bitcoin are usually something snide, like they just singlehandedly figured out the weak point of the bitcoin network, like, "WHATS STOPPING SOMEONE FROM JUST COPYING BITCOINS?" it just makes you facepalm to the point where tolerance becomes quite low.

i keep hearing this argument. read me loud and clear: claiming that bitcoiners have "faith in the state to not want to destroy a competitive currency", or are "depending on other people to not wreck their money" are complete fallacies. you are just lumping incorrect assertions that someone could somehow sabotage bitcoin (even though it hasnt happened) into your statements.
@_date: 2014-06-28 08:13:14
i agree with you on this. Hopefully the ETF's will not stifle real world demand and stagnate the price like gold and silver have done over past 3-4 yrs. also in the event of hyperinflation i worry about another mtgox scenario (oh noes, our ETF's coins are all gone!)

you clearly do not understand how fractional reserve works. as long as less people are withdrawing BTC or fiat than depositing, you can run a fractional reserve. there is no way for anyone to say they havent been doing it for some time now. usually this type of stuff only happens during a price dip.

when you publish this kind of FUD about bitcoin, you don't need to tell people you aren't holding any. its quite obvious. if you cant understand how bitcoin is valuable then you need to do some more research. how many conference talks have you watched? how many hours have you spend on youtube and reading articles? is it in the thousands of hours? it needs to be in the thousands of hours for you to really understand it. think of bitcoin as a car, that comes with its own toll free roads, that can fly across oceans. wouldnt you pay more for that car?

from what i've seen the only trolls in here seem to be pretty anti-bitcoin. and theyre usually nice to the naysayers and skeptics, with whom they agree.
bitcoiners for the most part are pretty straightforward and we just believe in the protocol. We enjoy fantasizing about going to the moon, and in fact many early adopters already have, and wish nothing more than for all of us to be bitcoin adopters.
Granted, the techie guys in here can sometimes be pretty harsh, but hey, they're the talent. They created this whole thing. The reason we are all here is because of cryptographers and programmers.

if it is so easy, why aren't you rich on a beach somewhere, instead of trolling r/bitcoin? if it were easy to mine, everyone would do it, and then the currency has no value. you forgot how to economics.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:11:39
greed is inherent in any culture. as long as they are mined at a fixed, predictable rate (unlike the fed) wealth will distribute as it should. alot of people at the top will have most of it, but at least theyre not in bed with the government helping them print it.

its the school system here. they introduced the Prussian school model about 50 years ago, and that generation is now in power, with an even MORE indoctrinated generation (mine) coming right behind it. its gotten to the point where questioning the government is actually sort of a taboo. even the other day, asking my manager if i could opt out of a 401k plan (i can save my own money) and he asked why. I explained I'd rather save my money than have the company invest it in the stock market, and then pay 50% taxes when i want to take it out. he said, "oh we got a conspiracy theorist eh?" its gotten to the point where even the simplest everyday compulsory things like income tax, nsa spying, drone strikes, doesnt even cause a stir in the average american's mind. however, get DUCK DYNASTY or mainstream media involved, and millions upon millions of people suddenly care. the master plan is playing out quite nicely over here.

risk of what? if you are worried about risk, you need to do some research! a weightless, instant, scarce, hardcoded form of wealth has no risk. it will have ups and down but if you are long-term, the only thing that might happen is governments cracking down on it, but people think that will be about as effective as outlawing the internet.

"The goal of bitcoin miners is to pull in more than what they spend on their rigs - some cost over US$20,000 - and the electricity they need to keep the machines running 24 hours a day.
It has become so hard to make a profit that comparisons to the 19th century California gold rush, when money was often made selling shovels to naive prospectors, have become a running joke among bitcoin miners."
So yeah, the labor-intensive process here would be working your ass off to save the $20,000 you would need to be profitable. if you mine on your CPU, with the current difficulty, you could make about 1-2$ per WEEK in BTC. You also need to be well versed in coding and security to run a profitable operation, or your shit will just get jacked by hackers.

whats hard to grasp for most ppl is decreasing prices (shelf prices denominated in BTC, not BTC/USD price), having to use a lower and lower denomination. unlike the dollar, which we are so used to increasing prices over the years.. where you used to be able to buy some shit for 5cents, which now costs a dollar and pennies alone are practically not worth the effort to pick them up. theyll get it eventually =D

My father preached the scam of the federal reserve since i was old enough to talk. Once I heard it was a hard coded limit, deflationary currency run by a decentralized network, its a no brainer. I was bullish on gold until i realized that people are perfectly happy owning a piece of paper SAYING they have gold, which the bank doesnt even physically have. this manipulates prices. Bitcoin is immune from this; why would you accept a certificate for bitcoin when you can just as easily buy one from ANYONE and get it transferred to your wallet?

i feel that is a bunch of keynesians that i wouldnt trust with 10 dollars, let alone my life savings. BTC is ACTUAL money, not leveraged instruments like ETFs that could implode literally any day, BTC has shown to be actually getting less volatile with each downturn and then consequent upswing. and we are still performing somewhere in the 5000% range for the year. we dont need your 401k's, we can save our own money.

Bitcoin is awesome. Here is the way I see things going down. as more and more people go off the grid by using BTC only, and as the governments watch their fiat dollar buy less and less and less, even while extracting exorbitant amounts of taxes from our paychecks, our value and net worth as a community of early adopters will continue to increase. 
People say that the government has an army and that is what backs the dollar. to them I ask, would YOU continue to serve without a paycheck? or would you join the side with the money that actually works? 
there will be no fighting, because without money purchasing power, the government cannot wage war. i just got a liberty boner.

then you need to understand what open source means. the entire history of transactions is available on the block chain. the monetary policy is hard coded into the source code, 10 minutes per block, difficulty goes up with the total hashrate of the network, and we will top out at 21 million coins, at which point a tiny fraction of a percent for transaction fees will sustain the network thereafter.
i for one do not speculate on value, i use my bitcoins to buy things, like alot of people here. and i always buy more when the price dips, because ultimately i believe their utility makes them hugely undervalued.
If you think an open source peer to peer ledger is somehow less transparent than corporate shares and holdings as they are handled now, you are sadly mistaken. besides, BTC is not a stock anyway, it is a CURRENCY. you need to do more research.
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:20:05
my buddy just dropped 900$ on pee pee coins. not sure when people will realize that while the altcoins rise in conjunction with bitcoin, the PER BTC ratio of these coins, which is really all that matters if you are speculatiing, is mostly stagnant.

the only way they would be able to "lock it down" is if they shut down the internet, or power grid. barring those options (which would no doubt render us with much larger problems than money), they will be about as effective at shutting down bitcoin as they are with bittorrent.

its volatile because its being adopted so quickly. dont let that throw you off. and i would go so far as to say if we didnt have day traders we wouldnt have these crazy sell offs, but i actually encourage it because it allows me to buy more BTC every time it dips. As the price stabilizes over the next few years, the day trading will stabilize, and from there we will see a very steady valuation in all currencies. ive heard people describe it as the beginning phase for any start up (before most companies go public, which is why by that time, most of the volatility has been leveled out.)

If I have a paper wallet, generated offline securely all that good stuff, then printed it to a password protected PDF file and uploaded it to a dropbox account, what are the realistic odds or possibility that someone could somehow hack my computer, get into my dropbox, hack into the pdf, and then decrypt my private key? 
Sorry, I'm just not really programming literate, more of a big picture kind of guy, I'm super excited about BTC and am VERY familiar with austrian economics and the precarious situation in which the USD (and all fiat currencies for that matter) finds itself.

sweet, thanks, its just missing on the phone app. just curious does anyone know how to enable change addresses in the android app?
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:15:20
precisely, the people who can bring the beautiful features of BTC to the laymen with security and stability will be at a premium
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:48:45
right. same applies for USD.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:51:10
this is literally the same shit that happens today. theives know to get any real loot, they have to get someone to the ATM. alot of people do not carry cash anymore. So yes, realistically, you could get them stolen by force, but this applies to ALL money. even the little numbers in your bank account balance.

without a doubt. s4 and note are top tier.

BTC runs on the notion that money is money because of its features:
1) fungibility - meaning i can clearly see that 1 BTC = 1 BTC or 1$=1$, not applicable to things like shells or rocks.
2) transportability - bitcoin can even be stored completely in your head, all you need is the private key address and you have access to your funds
3) scarcity - only 21million will ever be mined, its hard coded in the software for the difficulty of mining to go up as the computing power of the entire network goes up, but thats hardly a problem bc the units will be divisible up to 0.00000001 (satoshis)
4) recognizability - transactions are confirmed thru thousands of "nodes" (usually miners running very complex computer systems) that keep the entire blockchain or ledger of transactions going
TL;DR these 4 qualities encompass its "intrinsic" value
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:57:30
out of all the bitcoins that have ever existed. exactly zero have suffered hyper inflation. ill take those odds.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:39:38
could you elaborate please?
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:44:31
bullshit article trying to get people to sell. try again, BofA.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:03:53
im confused. from what ive read, they would have no way of knowing that information transferred is bitcoin, kinda like how they cant really "shut down" bittorrent... can you explain how specifically they would go about it? i understand that hollywood represents a very small amount of money, but the financial sector i can see how they would do everything they could to stop it. just wondering exactly how it would be possible if they cant even stop something like bittorrent. explain it to me like im 5? thanks =]
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:53:25
we are SUPER early adopters. this thing is so big, and people have no idea now. dont underestimate the profits that might come from being awake to how REAL non debt-based money works. most people just live their daily lives chasing this paper they know NOTHING about.

how do you feel now OP?
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:10:39
You were not arrested. You merely subitted to incriminate yourself. Get a lawyer asap. Ever notice one thing in common about all law and order episodes? They always get the culprit to confess. I think this is a ploy by the mainstream media and networks to get you to think that you are actually going to help yourself by confessing. When in reality you are just making the job easier for the police to bust you which is the ultimate goal no matter if you are guilty or not
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:24:38
lol thats what i thought. silly paul.

FinCEN eh? lol
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:46:27
no need to worry about that any time soon. 21,000,000 BTC x 100,000,000 (amout of divisible BTC in 1 unit, aka a satoshi or 0.00000001 BTC).
2,100,000,000,000,000 or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis.

@_date: 2013-12-19 14:58:42
you completely missed the point of this post. he is insinuating that newport beach lamborghini will need a suicide hotline due to the depreciating value in BTC. However, it is obvious he did zero research before posting, because all of these transactions are converted immediately to fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:30:02
your posts are ALWAYS dumb and trollish, thats why you get downvoted
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:06:56
someone already downvoted it, i thought it was cool, as it is bascially mixing the "risk" of selling and trying to take profit with the "inherent expense" (economic terminology fail?) of buying food.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:39:20
have you ever mined? especially in this insane difficulty? ever tried procuring an ASIC? you seem to know nothing about how it works, which is making you look quite silly.
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:26:51
Its not technically illegal but it would however make you the biggest douche on the face of the planet. Find another way to solve your financial issues. Other people's gifts shouldnt even have popped into your head in this matter.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:00:43
aj is just like schiff. they need to learn, research, and then position in BTC. it is the currency of the silent revolution against the fed and USD, which is what they both advocate for and will profit from.
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:42:46
i think alot of us did. i can understand why peter schiff (who is one of the smartest proponents for austrian economics) is against bitcoin, he SELLS metals. but how on earth can Alex Jones not understand how bitcoin has the potential to free the world, by causing a mass exit from the banks, and a switch to real, non debt-based money?

hes a philosopher with some pretty controversial ideas. check him out on youtube
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:30:46
2 days to make ~$0.30... you need a job to invest any real money in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:01:01
its anything BUT stable. but i know the mechanics behind it, and i know the mechanics behind the USD. ill take "finite amount of supply" over "print and borrow into oblivion"
