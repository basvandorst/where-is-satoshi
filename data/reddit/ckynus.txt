The price is what people are willing to pay for it.

The government is still attempting to catch up and decide their position on the whole thing. Better question is why do you care? Just bounce your IP and do your thing.

I assume you never lost anything on mtgox, silk road, or any of these exchanges that vanished in the past. Understand if your funds are online you don't have the wallet. If they go so does your wallet. Also you are missing out on the free money forks, and who doesn't like free money.

not saying its is definitive proof, just saying there were very little variables to this which makes it awful suspicious. its not like i use this account often and would be unsure as to where it went bad. i used it in one place so its quite simple to put them on my short list of suspects.

There is bitcoin abc fork upcoming splitting from bitcoin cash. So obviously people are stocking up on it because they like free money.

but that is the point. i give my info to coinbase so i can send them money. somehow that info then ended up in the hands of a scammer, that's where i have a problem.

I am going to get bashed for this but I had a bad experience. There was a false charge on my account. They later admitted the problem and credited me.

not $50, $49.95 that is the distinction to make. fraudulent charges under 50 do not warrant the effort for the banks to recover.

Yea they reimbursed me but I canceled that credit line anyway as a safety precaution. I don't think the experience I had is the norm, but just giving you a heads up.

i did that first thing of course because i noticed, i was simply attempting to notify others of what happened to me so they could be careful themselves. i was not expecting people to attack me for besmudging their darling coinbase.
 websites get compromised occaisionaly and i was attempting to advise caution.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:04:09
why would it be any different. the info a legit business needs to make a charge and the info a scammer needs are the same.

I feel like life sentences in America always end up shorter. I assume he gets out at some point.

That's what happens the price is volitile. But my assumption is it will continue to rise until Nov 16th after the segwit fork.

Huh? Are you saying the dread pirate Roberts doesn't have gazillions of bitcoins stashed away waiting for him?
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:22:43
He sure does look poor
