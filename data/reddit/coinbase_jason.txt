Just an update. The updated certificate is now live on our production servers and we've tested that the error with Mycelium no longer occurs at this time. Thank you sincerely for your patience while we worked to get this updated!

For point of sale acceptance, most merchants currently use a phone or tablet device to show a QR code to the customer.
We recommend creating a Hosted Checkout page at:  (Item name: Your Store Name, amount: a small amount such as $1.00), click "Show advanced options", and check the box for "Let the user change the amount". Then you can bookmark this page on the phone or tablet, refresh the page or click "Start a new payment" at the bottom of the order page when you have a new customer, and set the amount to be paid. Your customer can then scan the QR code and pay the order.
That'd be the easiest way to get started accepting bitcoin payments using our merchant tools for a brick and mortar store.
