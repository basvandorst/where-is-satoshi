Isn't the in game token worth like 100k+ gold now???
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:14:41
This is true. But some exchanges have a flat per transaction fee as well.

Wondering what's going on exactly? Trading started shooting up at around 4am PST. Not quite familiar with my timezones.

You can buy fractions of a coin. You don't have to buy one whole coin.

Login is fine, but I get an error any time I try to go to the settings page.

You’re one of many my friend. It will rise again.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:28:30
I am also curious what caused the sudden jump.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:52:01
From what I understand, it's not viable anymore unless you've got a super computer. It'll also overheat/possibly destroy your machine if you're not careful.

I hear CMEME will be trading in futures soon.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:43:55
Tell us how you really feel.

QuadrigaCX. Coinsquare.

No. A lot of people will lose money trying to time the market. Not to mention you need to be moving huge volumes to capitalize on 1-2% price fluctuations.

Seriously... Just this morning I was setting my 13k alert.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:47:03
1. Any amount is enough. You can buy fractions of bitcoins. As long as you believe the price will go up, you're fine.
2. Hardware wallets are popular. Look into Trezor or Nano Ledger S.
3. Not sure what you mean. Either you keep your bitcoin on the exchange, or transfer it to your wallet.
4. Buy low, sell high. Timing it? Good luck. You could also try dollar cost averaging. You can use limit orders to set your own buy/sell price. Just have to be realistic that the market will hit said price.
If you're in it for the long term, don't worry about trying to time the market. Just buy, and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:03:57
So... Get off your ass, and buy?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:40:06
If they did, they'd be millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:27:38
Layman here, could you tell me what's happening? Just noticing the current price rise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:13:00
The important thing is that we broke past the 10k wall. It's still uphill from there -- Every day has its swings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:56
That's the thing, though. When you're buying through an exchange, they need that information because it's the law. If you were trading bitcoins peer-to-peer, all you need is a wallet. You could be completely anonymous otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:37:21
I also think it opens up Bitcoin more into the mainstream due to increased exposure.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:21:00
Just think about the long term. Bitcoin has already come back stronger.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:31:09
You got balls, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:25:36
Been waitin 72 hours to get verified so far. From what I understand, it could take up to a week to get verified now because of the increased account signups?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:07
I haven't started to dabble in limit orders yet -- Are there fees associated with cancelling/expiring a limit order? Do limit orders expire?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:40
Considering everyone who has ever bought bitcoin has done it... you can join in or not. It’s to prevent criminal activity. ISIS moving cash, etc
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:45:07
It's steadily been going up since hitting 10k earlier.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:25:24
Jokes on you. It’s already past 13k... Canadian...
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:07:38
60% of the time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:21:56
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:21:47
Is just a number. What happens when it goes to 6?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:04:04
Open up a coinsquare or quadriga account. Transfer Bitcoin to either. Sell from there.
Coinsquare verification was instantaneous. Quadriga took about 3.5 business days -- But I think I prefer trading on Quadriga from now on.

Lower fees when depositing via interac online. Placing limit orders is also much simpler.
