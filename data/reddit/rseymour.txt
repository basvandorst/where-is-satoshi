This is just conjecture. Delightful, but still just conjecture. Assuming Gox have not lost much BTC (no rock solid evidence they actually have) they are still viable with their user base. Their tarnished name would die, but their accounts would live on if an investor or investors would buy them.
Look at how many "first mover" companies and products crap out, from Friendster/MySpace to Yahoo, to Palm, to Creative (rio anyone?)... Still much of their intellectual property and/or userbase got bought up.  That's the exit Mr. K should seek.
I think this is just downtime before assets are liquidated and lawyers are upped. Losing that much coin would be amazing, Occam's razor suggests gox figuring out that freezing trade would lower the price of BTC to the point where their BTC and fiat reserves would balance  again.  When that happened, boom, open up trading and all is well. 
Same sort of shit the US govt dealt with when we were on the gold std and that the Greek/Cypriot/EU countries have to deal with on the euro standard.  If you can't directly control the supply of BTC you have to fuck with demand circuitously to maintain 100% reserve.  With high frequency trading, confirmation times, etc. it must be a real bitch.  Glad I didn't have to design it on the fly, rewrite it once after a big hack and then watch it slowly burn up as my cash reserves got eaten by various legal fees and operating costs.
Good luck to kraken, coinbase, etc.  It is a damn hard problem.
Of course localbitcoins is doing just fine afaik.

NY has the most mature financial regs in the country.  If gov.

There's a lot to be said against bad reactionary laws, but a lot can be said for moving fast to legalize new tech and ideas that are otherwise illegal.
Also I believe the US District court in NY serves as the de facto court for moving financial regs to the federal level.  This is big news.

So the question as well as I can formulate it (also an engineer, materials science actually) offhand is:
If the value of one bitcoin is increasing monotonically due to deflation and eventual fixed number, then let's fast-forward to all bitcoins being out there.
Then up to that point people have generally been hoarding, losing wallets, occasionally buying things, but assume in the end there are enough holders out there that there could be some sort of economy.  What is the incentive to buy anything with bitcoin which is always going up in real value vs a floating currency like the dollar?  The only argument seems to be that I can send bitcoins free of charge anywhere in the world.  No fees if I don't care about speed of the transaction.
I'm just working this out in my head, but essentially, is the value of a bitcoin sitting on your computer worth more traded into dollars to buy a vase from Ghana (with associated transfer fees) or is it worth more as the method of transaction.
If it is worth more in dollars, then hoarding will win out assuming rational actors?  Right?  I bet I missing some other pitfalls as well as other reasons to do transactions in bitcoin.  Illicit transactions are a big one, but that just sucks for the legitimacy of the system in general.
@_date: 2012-12-12 17:51:16

I personally think you are absolutely correct.  I think bitcoins will become a fixed commodity not a currency.  The only hope they have of not being hoarded is that they are usable in situations where other forms of transfer are not possible.  I'm not sure if that usability will keep them worth anything though.
I'm interested more in your thoughts as I'm only a fan of modern economic theory, but never wanted to go past 101 in college.

The only problem with this is that it makes the whole flyer seem like a joke.  They could've worded it better, but putting "using cash" and "using credit cards under different names" on the same sentence is decidedly ludicrous.
Also the one for tattoo parlors being on the lookout for customers who insist on using cash... what about tattoo parlors that insist you pay in cash? ... In spite of that, some of the other warnings are seemingly obvious, but at least they are genuine.  The cash blunder just makes it seem like they are missing the grasp of the reality of... purchasing things...

To all of the folks whining about Wikipedia not accepting bitcoins (or other commodity donations) can someone hire a CPA and a lawyer to work out how they could handle the accounting and possible tax liabilities?  
The third party that would take the accumulated bitcoins and translate them into currency would need to have their accounting air tight as well I imagine. 
Do any major accounting systems handle bitcoin right now?  What is the cost of moving to one that did or upgrading what they have?
It is not as trivial as putting a BTC address up for a large nonprofit. The little user groups worldwide can accept them without the overhead.
Wikipedia.org can accept them when they get the pro bono support to flesh out an infrastructure for them. I imagine it could cost $3k-$15k to do it right. But I don't know Jimmy Wales or the org that well. 
If their payment processor started doing it they could leverage that.

I have no philosophical reason for using bitcoins any more than I have a philosophical reason for surfing the web.  It's cool, it's a neat protocol/concept.  I think all of the libertarian stuff is crap.  
Bitcoin is a nice way to say I have 10 things and I want to give you 3 things now I have 7 things and you have 3 things over a wire in a trustworthy way.  It removes the write-once copy-infinitely nature of digital 'ownership' which I think is a new concept.  That's a concept, not a philosophy.
To reiterate, I don't agree with any of the grotesque outmoded paranoid pseudo-philosophies that seem to lead some to bitcoin.

Well, CUDA has the power of now 4 years (gosh I'm old) of development, which in my opinion was why it **destroyed** the Cell.  With cell you had to do DMAs by hand, everything was stupidly hard and when you looked at CUDA code you got very jealous.
So now it looks like ATI/OpenCL may come and sneak in with a bit faster cards.  Thing is, nVidia may still stay ahead simply by virtue of huge developer support (their debugger for example).  
Most of the code I'd like to see sped up, won't vectorize well, so it won't go over on GPGPUs.  In many cases it becomes easier to compute the same thing over and over as needed instead of store it/pass it.
Got a little wordy there at the end... bottom line, study hard for your course.  Good luck!  Sure beats programming form validation for web sites.  ;-)

I have a masters in high performance computing from USC.  A distributed network like the bitcoin net is very good when the computation requires relatively small shared memory and very little internode communication.  The bitcoin model is perfect for this.  Protein folding is also pretty good, but the serious protein folders want lots of teraflops under their control, not farmed out to people just for the hell of it.  In the end of your sim you want a fair amount of data.
The wicked stuff that my group does, billion atom molecular dynamics doesn't scale well on distributed networks (grids).  Same with CFD, etc.  You're dealing with movement of particles (or charge or whatever you want) and you have to track a lot info going between nodes.
So... what you want is an [embarassingly parallel]( problem.  Bitcoin is bigger than folding at home because even the hint of $$$ gets people excited!
Of course when the market corrects down to $5 or less per coin... well... so it goes.  I don't think bitcoin will go away any time soon, even with quantum computers.
Google compute offers grants for people with embarrassingly parallel problems to solve on google computers.
One neat thing for computational science/physics is that as graphics cards get bigger and faster (also there is the whole issue of vectorizability which I've conveniently glossed over) you can run multiple *systems* on one machine (or one card) or cluster then compare the end results.  That's sort of what folding at home was doing, only now you can do much larger things.  Parallel replica MD.
Cool stuff.  Bitcoin got the magic bullet cash money, into the equation.  If you could do parallel scientific computation for $$$ you'd be onto something.
Also, all hashing crap, password cracking, blah blah could be done easily.

This is *the* problem of using bitcoin as a currency.  Who says there is any logic to have bought something with BTC at $20 when later it's up over $40.  You just missed out on doubling your money.
A person could make the argument that they want to keep the BTC ecosystem moving, but they certainly can't make the argument that they got more value spending the BTC at $20 than they would've keeping it and spending it later.
The counterargument is that BTC can be used more conveniently for certain transactions.  For example bitcointip, etc.  I think small transactions and large (somewhat illicit?) transactions across borders will keep bitcoin alive, but in the middle:

Bitcoin won't have the government protecting its value unless there is some real legwork done by our legislators and economy wonks to track prices, etc at the very least. 
So bitcoin will be as valuable, but it may never stabilize ever. The fact that there are less and less being mined over time will create a scarcity which will continue this upward trend. At some point one could imagine all of the bitcoins mined sitting at $10k each. At that point volatility would be down and you could make the calculation do I use ACH, PayPal, western union, a paper check, etc to send my money. With transaction fees (and possibly exchange fees if the person needs cash) you may or may not find bitcoin to be the cheapest. 
If it isn't the cheapest, then what are they worth? They could be worth a lot to collectors perhaps, but like civil war coins they wouldn't have much value as currency... More just as curios.

Another lesson in why actually spending bitcoins is often a bad idea.
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:07:52
I'm gonna go through this point by point since these are smart points that disprove my argument to some degree:
* "you own your own money" -- I think you have ownership of any material item you have as much as a bitcoin.  Some will argue that law permits the government to confiscate currency, but civil asset forfeiture laws do the same thing.  Ownership is just as much *protected* by a government as infringed.  
* "supply is limited" -- Bitcoin may be the first digital creation with scarcity.  That is freaking amazing.
* "transactions must not be reversible" -- no takebacks, not sure how that is important.  The micropayment channel concept involves creating a transaction and a refund transaction simultaneously, which essentially allows a reversible transaction over bitcoin.
* "central authorities are detrimental to the quality of a currency" -- are they?  The US, Australia, etc have powerful currencies and have central authorities controlling them.  Bitcoin requires a decentralization for fairness only., if the blockchain processing power were to be centralized in the future it is possible that 99% of the users wouldn't even care!  interesting thought right?  If a benign dictatorship of infinite computing power took over bitcoin in 2030, would the main users care?  As long as their transactions went through.  
And you're totally right about mp3.
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:07:34
I think you are right about source code and opinions. Indeed the design of code is often centered around patterns that utilize metaphors from human interaction.
The point I am trying to make is that bitcoin in particular is a method of accounting for transactions in a publicly verifiable way. It maintains a certain degree of anonymity, but beyond that it doesn't have an agenda that an impartial observer could recognize. 
I could make the same statement regarding BitTorrent, Tor, the MP3 codec, or other open standards, but I couldn't make the same statement about closed DRM schemes. 
A bit of software may express an opinion, but I'd like to see open source examples with opinions outside of the README, LICENSE and comments in the code. 
I can think of the early samizdat (ruby cms, communist) maybe WASTE (but what sort of politics?) any other ones?

I think bitcoin was at least 10x overvalued at $250.  But I think we can rely on the markets to come up with some reasonable value long term (as I wrote 20 years)...  Even then it could be disrupted by something that could run faster with better features, etc.
I could go all day about how *jacked* the US policy is currently.  I think we need to be spending money as a government until our GDP starts growing.
The stock bitcoin user arguments about fiat being the spawn of the devil fall flat for me.

Think outside the eurozone where corruption is more rampant. I'm not saying that it's a great use case, but it's one of about a thousand. 
I feel like there are possible futures where the bitcoin economy crashes under its own wealth condensation, vast sell offs and demand dropping to levels that can't support online exchanges. It could happen, but it's hard to imagine the ultimate death of the blockchain from disuse/misuse. Then again it will happen someday maybe in the mid to late IPv6 era?  
Hard to predict these things, isn't it?  I just know its the only investment I've made since I could get in small on something I believed in on technical merit. The last one (the google ipo) took too much capital. 
So here we are maybe it will drop to $1.75 in a few days. I still think the validity of the tech remains. The exchange rate is highly speculative.

I don't think you understand this.  Liberty Reserve had direct ties to child exploitation.  Child exploitation was the theme of the forum (which had other speakers).  Bitcoin is the most important virtual currency.  Her objectives were:
* State that law breaking organizations like Liberty Reserve have been and always will be held accountable for their crimes
* Bitcoin the currency represents the future of digital currency.
* The service corporations that utilize bitcoin will be held to the standards of all money service corporations.
* Tie it all into the topic of the forum by bringing up child exploitation as a way that virtual currencies can be used criminals
Does that make sense?  If you watch CSPAN or go to these forum events, this sort of presentation is quite normal.  A speech is made on topic X even though the forum is about Y.  Y is addressed in the speech, but only in passing.

I just submitted a pull request so it can handle encrypted wallets (but it hardcodes the flag setting an encrypted wallet).  I will work on it more to catch the encryption status of the wallet.

Sure, gladly.  Let me preface with my answer to 
* 1a: prices will 'stabilize' like any limited resource, meaning they'll go up until that resource is just another thing.  Copper prices are pretty stable I imagine, but it is still worth something (there are a bunch of kinds of copper now that I tried to google it)  
* 1b: No telling.  Sometime in the next 25 years?   
* 1c: Answered in a, probably rather steady prices, going down only once   an alternative cryptographic currency/commodity takes hold  
Now back to 2, or why all that stuff doesn't matter all that much:  
* 2a: Fanatics, technocrats, political ideologues, hobbyists, investors, bitcoin companies and government agencies (not in that order).  
* 2b: Yes, the exchanges are the main problem if you want to do a dollar-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;dollar transaction instead of say a (dollar)-&gt;credit card-&gt;dollar transaction.  I put the second dollar in parenthesis since you pay your CC after the transaction.  Ideally I'd want to move dollars to bitcoins the moment before I spent them in order to reduce any possible losses and right now I need to have money on a working exchange to do that.  Too hard for me, so I'll keep using my CC in general.   
* 2c: No idea if their business model is sound due to the volatility mentioned above.  I hope so.  They obviously handle the bitcoin-&gt;dollar part of the imaginary transaction above.
* 2d:  I don't know much about it but I believe Japan offers 0% interest loans and they're doing ok (depending on which economist you ask).  The US is pretty close.
I recall telling a friend about bitcoin and saying that the real value is that prior to bitcoin you couldn't send a fixed number over the internet...  In other words, I have 2 apples, you have none and I give you one, now we both have one. I could never do that online with anything.  With bitcoins I can make that transaction, timestamp it, and everyone can prove that we each have one bitcoin.
Question 3. How much is that simple new ability worth?

I'm sure you know carpenters, etc who work do years under the table. Millions can't be hidden, but people (especially undocumented workers and the working poor) live on cash under the table. I think that's more due to fiscal policy punishing people through income and payroll taxes while letting institutional wealth run wild (all in the name of lowering the debt). But I'm in a minority in /r/ bitcoin. 
In general tho, pay yr taxes.

One of the hosts of the forum was "The International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children," hence as is the norm with stuff like this the talk was tailored to work in this context.  In this case it wasn't hard since Liberty Reserve had direct connections with such things.
A great quote from the end: 


This was her tying into her prior remark that virtual currencies are legitimate parts of the currency system writ large and the organizations that play ball with bog standard rules and regulations are going to have a bottom line advantage in attracting customers.

I think there is something to be said for comparing the consensus manner of the blockchain to organization, but it's actually a democratic process at best.  If you have 51% of the network you can control what transactions get into the blockchain history.  You don't need 100% consensus.  Unlike OWS.

Civil asset forfeiture comes as part of the evidence gathering process.  As long as there is a warrant search and seizure are allowed.  People have been fighting to make such seizure less damaging to suspects for ages, to very limited success: 
[edit] errrgh, it's been ages since I was read up on this stuff.  I forgot that the main issue is that you can have your stuff taken.  Then you could be found personally innocent in criminal court, but your stuff is still gone in civil asset forfeiture because you have to prove your belongings are innocent.

As a (the only one on reddit?) non-libertarian fan of bitcoin I approve of this.  He's had to forge a 3rd way with the most crippling defeat of modern american politics: the no man's land of being one of the few men ever to win the popular vote and lose the office.
He doesn't have much credibility anymore, but his looks into the future have been surprisingly prescient over the years.  His gravelly voice seems to be a self-caricature at this point, but he's a very informed man.
Good on him.

Relevant since the blockchain provides a great dataset for doing large scale data mining and network analysis to expose suspicious groups. It's funny that people confuse normal bitcoin use with privacy or anonymity. It's barely more private than a cell bought with cash. 
Tor is supported by the US government, along with a bunch of tested encryption protocols. The laws that legalized this were passed at the tail end of the Bush admin after years of *illegal* wiretapping of a similar nature. 
The only thing he revealed was the code name and all he did was break the laws he'd sworn to uphold. Whistleblowers.gov exists for a reason and I wonder if he tried it prior to going for 31337 points.

But the informal economy is how many folks earn their income: 
The value of bitcoin is in the transaction chain and the fact that the ability to flash bitcoins across the net without third parties is unmatched. Their are other crypto currencies, sure, but bitcoin is the first mover. 
Is it a speculative asset? Yes. But it's not just a speculative asset. As long as I can buy $1000 in BTC, bring it to France and sell it for Euros it's worth it on the chance that I can beat the exchange rate. In fact if it were illegal it would only increase in value I imagine. 
I'm glad it seems to be a legally defined part of the economy in the US, Germany and China. We'll see what India and other big players make of it. 
It's in no danger of hurting national economies any more than trade in any other commodity/asset (LCDs, textiles, etc).  But the countries that make the right moves involving Bitcoin might profit handily by cornering the market. 
Fun stuff but I'd like to see it drop a factor of 50 or even 500 so people aren't so put off by the price of a single coin. Total catastrophic disruption of the current bitcoin economy now would only strengthen it in the future.

Bitcoin is a protocol and like email bad things happen over that communication method. Spam could've killed email's usefulness, but spam filtering saved it. Bitcoin will work as a protocol for communicating double entry accounting regardless of volatility in the USD &lt;-&gt; BTC trade.
