You can move your money to your wallet, you just have to pay a fee. It’s costly because it’s the most expensive, widely used and energy consuming crypto.

@_date: 2017-12-16 12:25:20
It has increased almost 2000% this year alone and it’s just getting started. If it does it again next year with mainstream adopters then that values it at roughly 400k, although I think it will end up about the 100k mark. You should ask yourself why would whales sell if it’s going up?

I’m not sure what the definition of a store of value is, but to me it means tomorrow I wont be poorer than today. It used to be PMs but they are cumbersome to buy, hold and then use.

If I was in Greece around the time of their financial crisis I would’ve put all my money into bitcoin, those who kept it in a bank lost 20% as a ‘haircut’ to pay off creditors.

Block size is exactly the current problem. It needs to increase now, it’s unusable. It has none of the attributes bitcoin wanted to be. It’s not usable for micro transactions, it has priced out the ‘unbankable’, it’s slow. If I wanted fucking electronic gold I would’ve bought some coins.

I’d ask the opposite, why wouldn’t someone accept it as payment? 
Fiat currency is dead, it was when the central banks were given complete control over monetary policy, and their decision ... a stealth tax on every citizen through irresponsible money printing and fractional reserve banking.
1 btc will always be 1 btc, completely open and transparent. No fraud, no printing, complete trust. That alone in monetary terms is priceless. Trust in fiat is at an all time low, trust in bitcoin is on an upward trend. This is a tipping point in world economics and wealth distribution.

Falling real wage (take home vs inflation) along with stagnated productivity sounds great. Lets just carry on with that because you know better to be in the club than outside. 
We wont be the last to leave. As soon as you take away the democratic right of a country (check out Greece and Italy who have had voted policies overturned) then what is left for the worker. No surprise really then that non-EU european countries rank higher than their EU counterparts in life satisfaction studies.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:56:13
Depends. As long as the rate of increase in pay outstrips inflation they will have more disposable income and so may actually end up buying more. Your zero change assumes pay increase matches inflation. Don’t forget the rich still need to buy stuff. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:51:04
Nope, my £ is still a £. But what it does mean is that it is more expensive for that CEO to buy his second home in Spain. A devalued pound increases exports and rebalances our economy away from net importer to hopefully net exporter. This has a double effect of increasing manufacturing, again rebalancing away from the financial sector with which we rely too much on for our economy. 
CBI have said that Brexit will be bad for business. Why do you think that is. Because they will have to pay people a real, decent, living wage when cheap european labour ends. Simple market forces of labour availability will do this. Oh, and this means that CEO will get a pay cut, and less dividends from his shares, but this will be terrible for Britain of course.

I said apple.

The OP mentioned he was selling his bitcoin and putting it into apple and amazon stock. I replied by saying he will not 10x on those stocks. Read the fucking OP before replying with this shit.

They are meant to be impartial, their coverage of Brexit showed me otherwise. Full of overpaid TV ‘celebs’ who just tax avoid. Joke.

I’ve never put money into jesus, it’s a scam.

Say what you like about bitcoin but it has made me more money than the stock market ever will. Do you think you will make 10x on apple stock? You should see volatility as confirmation that this is still in the early growth phase and that institutional money isn’t in this market yet (otherwise they would be buying up massive amounts of coins on these dips). This is all still individual investors with weak hands.

If a government banned bitcoin I would question what sort of government you have. 
They wont anyway.

Those gains can be seen in traditional assets, but they are not available to buy for people like me and you, because institutional investors have a monopoly over them. I don’t play the lottery, but I do take calculated risks.

Good, I hope they do a better job of looking after it than us

Volatility = profit if you have no fear

Maybe he is still conscious, stuck in an eternal frozen body in a vat underground, with no way out. Honestly why would you do this? The risk is eternal misery with no way of getting out, it’s nuts people even try this.

Sounds reasonably bullish. They are basically saying it needs regulating, which it does. Against scam ICOs to protect investors ... nothing too out of the ordinary here and likely to replicated in most western countries.

This is the biggest crash without a doubt. Mt gox was a freak but that market was artificial because people couldn’t actually cash out so making the value of dollars less, and therefore the fiat price of BTC more. 
I am now genuinely worried that the whole tether thing may in fact be true. And this market is a mtgox equivalent.
