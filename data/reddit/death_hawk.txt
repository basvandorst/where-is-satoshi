I would laugh so hard if it stayed exactly where it is. Forever,  
Actually I'd cry a little as well.

Do people seriously click random links in email in this day and age?  
I mean... c'mon...  
Should I also post a warning that the Prince of Nigeria isn't going to send you 5 million BTC but only if you send him 50BTC to bribe the guards blocking the vault holding the King's private keys?

I'm getting this right now. For example, I get emails to xim7rbntbj6 Like WTF. So I have to train my spam filters manually. 
Plus I'm being backscattered because stupid admins aren't using domain verification and think that I'm sending them spam and send me failure reports.

I watched OP's video first and was like "neat"!   
So I googled (Youtubed) to see what Paypal's ad was and was surprised it was identical except with a different lead out and ONE tiny clip at 0:17.  
It's literally a rip off. I'd be asking for a take down too if I were Paypal.

See that could easily be seen as a parody then.  
I skimmed the comments in this post looking for other versions but came up empty handed.

I watched both side by side and there's 2 changes. One at 0:17 with a chart of pricing instead of someone on the phone with the Paypal app and the ending with Bitcoin's logo over Paypals.  Everything else was literally identical.

I'm more curious to know what country DOESN'T have checks.

Why not $60M?

They have one in Vancouver too

Knowing BTC it's probably $100 now. Oh wait. Now it's back to $1.
