Not really. No one would mine based on this block as it's not valid, it therefore will be orphaned. The invalid coinbase also is not spendable yet.
Of course if all (or most) actors in the network mine invalid blocks then non mining validating nodes would add value in a situation like this

The crucial information bit here is that you don't establish the channel with the wine merchant (that would not require the LN, google Payment Channel) you establish the channel with a LN Hub and can pay anyone on the network with your money that is in the channel while it still remains yours to control (no third party trust required, resolving unfaithful actors however requires onchain transactions)

This sounds like a nice idea!
I don't think moving coins to specific addresses per product is a good idea though - it compromises pseudonomity and it would require the app to control private keys (which might be a problem) also doing that might be considered blockchain spam.
Aside from that: is there anyone that would actually want to use such an app (maybe you could manually use it as an fiat cash register too which would be nice)? How would it be monetized (the app provider should not control private keys of the shops - there can't be automated fees!)? 
Merchants would be responsible for securing their private keys which most probably are not comfortable doing.
Would there be liabilities imposed by law on the app provider as we are dealing with cash?

Depending of the stage of the outbreak you are right. We can only hope that the next difficulty adjustment will be in reach for the remaining miners. As the electricity infrastructure will not crash all at once (it will take weeks to month) and the rate of downfall will vary depending on location we should be fine.

Sounds like your Multibit might be set to use mBTC instead of BTC, so when you entered 0.02 you actually entered 0.00002 BTC -&gt; you should be fine. I would however expect that you only receive ~8€ worth of BTC as Virwox has very steep fees. 
(0.02BTC are currently worth ~7.5€)

Can a normal user not submit a transaction spending an anyone can spend output? A user not knowing about SW could do it without malicious intent and a miner not knowing about it either would mine it without malicious intent.

Why would a non segwit node reject it?

BCH has ~10% of Bitcoins hashrate, that means that 90% of the BTC hashrate remain mining BTC, this hashrate is completely capable of switching to BCH in an instant.
All current BCH transactions could be reversed within ~3 hours (roughly 12 blocks*1.1 so 14 blocks) if the complete available BTC hashrate attacked BCH (and we are pretty sure that there are single actors controlling at least 30% of that hashrate)
This of course is not economically feasible as it means lost opportunity for BTC block rewards
edit: reworded first paragraph for clarity, also we figure out by now that BCH likely has much less than 10% and it's currently looking like it's less than ~7% - left the original 10% figure for traceability.

That doesn't make any sense.

I don't know about US tax laws but the way I understand German tax laws are that in Germany you would need to pay taxes as you mine the Coins (with a day-precision of assumed complete selling) since you are generating value. You however don't have to pay capital gain taxes when selling the coins after they have been mined as you are not trading with them.

At the time of writing it looked like that on  (12 BCH blocks vs. ~100 btc blocks at same difficulty)
Currently to me it looks more like there is much less miner support for BCH. (BCH still at 12, 133 behind now)
Looks like the "mistery miner" stopped mining (see also  )
Note: I'm not trying to push any agenda here, just stating my obeservations, these are neither BCH positive nor negative.
edit: changed bth to bch

Hashes/second can only be guessed based on blocktime/difficulty.

Verifying something is solid gold requires complicated processes and specialised equipment. Verifying a crypto is valid is a basic operation within the system

The problem here is that making miners is expensive and energy for private homes is too expensive for this to ever make economic sense
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:31:26
I would advist critically considering this. Try to sell the amount you need for your house ASAP to get out of the price rollercoaster (which might or might now crash back down to 1~5k at any point in the next few month) 
Check how your local taxed work, in Germany you get a certain amount without tax and after that it's a flat 25% capital gains tax -&gt; there is little to be gained by waiting (could save ~1k)

As you can see from the graph averaged over full days upload never went higher than 6.5mbit/s. High(er) end consumer connections (read &lt;= 50€/Monath) in Germany easily get 5mbit/s upstream sometimes 10. For me it would be interesting to learn about the burst upstream used/required.

Ah yes, the cutoff at 23 and numbers starting at 00 should have been a giveaway. Sorry for that.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:52:38
Easier: yes but also the economic viability of the attack becomes less and less.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:07:02
If you believe the other chain to be an "attack" why would that concern you?
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:42:30
Only if you expect both chains to hold value which should not happen (but can)

Which is not a trivial feel. Also remember that 1% of BTC hashpower is worth 0.125BTC every 10minutes. Thus for this to be worth it large amounts of BCH need to be transacted/reversed.
From a legal standpoint the person doing the trade would owe the exchange money so you need to do this on an exchange that can't proescute you (ideally because it doesn't know who you are)
Due to mining centralisation the miners doing this will be rather easy to spot, however it might not be illegal to mine on an old chain (which would cause the reorg). That depends on whether this is an attack/a hack or a feature/a mistake/a bug. The difference is arbitrary.
-&gt; It's certainly not a trivial attack. But definetly possible.

Would also like to hear an explanation.  explains the address format if 11111 is indeed algorithmically harder to find than 11119 that would be a property of how normal distribution of numbers of ripemd(sha256(ecdsa pubkey)) behaves which I personally find unlikely (but maybe ripemd just doesn't like to produce 0s)
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:17:42
It's not.
