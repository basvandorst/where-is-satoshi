Yes, the method is called cash deposit. 
First, make sure you have enough cash for the amount of BTC you want. For simple deposits, I recommend that you enter the amount of USD you want to pay, rather than the amount of BTC you want. After that, look for the cheapest but rated seller accepting cash deposits in your country. Read their terms if they have any, then press the initiate trade button. Write down their bank account information and then go deposit the money. Don't forget to ask for a receipt. Take a picture of the receipt as proof, don't lose it. Upload that and you're done. :) 
I can't reply for another 10 minutes because of my downvotes.

Hello, I'm also under the age of majority, and I've purchased BTC successfully using LocalBitcoins without a car. Unless you live in a rural area, there should be a bank branch nearby. You can deposit into people's accounts without being a client at the bank. This is what I did. Hope this helps. :)

This is one of the areas that Doge excels in. :)

It may get annoying, but those "fun-sized" tips are mostly confined to and related subs, so steer clear and you'll be fine. 
Bitcoin does seem a little unapproachable by the average Joe, and I'm saying this as a user/miner of BTC since 2009.
I mean, you can't deny that is much more newb friendly.
