Right? It was awkward. Usually the interviews on the show are atleast somewhat informative. He didn't explain what it is, he didn't even bring up legit problems with it. Instead, he says people buy drugs with it (because people don't do that with dollars) and mentioned how he thought about buying one in person and that would be sketchy. Uhh, okay?

That is a direct, un-apportioned tax. All direct taxes have to be apportioned to be legal based on the constituion. Also, the required number of states needed to ratify the amendment to allow the income tax was never met. This has been cited in modern court cases.

The federal reserve regulates the currency, and the federal reserve is not a governmental entity. It is private. Anyhow, yes, they can regulate the legal tender. That doesn't make it illegal for citizens to barter any way they see fit. We could trade in the currency of chickens if we wanted to. They can create and regulate the legal tender of the nation. Doesn't mean we have to use it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:37:51
I wasn't taken seriously when I commented this on another post, so I will restate it here:
We are not investing in tulips here, we are investing in an idea. How long will we watch the federal reserve print money? How high will we let the debt go? How many times will we watch the government temporarily relieve the symptoms of the unhealthy economy, only to create a bigger problem later on? How many quantitative easings? How much more full of shit do our politicians have to be before the feeling of taxation without representation lives again?

If you COULD care less, that means you do care. If you couldn't care less, that means you do not care at all. Also, I understand that you are saying you mostly appreciate the idea. But, be honest, it would be nice to make money. It is silly to say you couldn't care less about your money.

Please stop. The statement that no criminal is happy is ludicrous. George Jung, for one, said he would do it all over again if he could. What defines a criminal in the first place? Somebody who breaks laws? What if they don't agree with the laws? What if they unknowingly break a law? Your claim is absurd.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:18:10
you are saying the site that sees 80% of total bitcoin trade is a scam? I don't hear anybody else saying mt. gox scammed them. If you sent money while you were still waiting for verification, that seems like a bad idea.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:51:37
Over half of bitcoin owners have never owned more than 10 btc. I wouldn't say "a lot of us are considerably wealthier than we were before." A few extra thousand is nice, but I don't see too many people making boocoo money that I would consider to be "considerably wealthier." I also wouldn't say we "busted our butts to earn money." I read and watch the bitcoinity chart. It's pretty easy. Who am I to say that I'm not lucky for coming across bitcoin? Perhaps it was clever of me to seize the opportunity once I discovered it, but can you really blame other people or call them stupid for being weary and not taking the gamble? Winning a gamble involves luck, and investments are to a certain extent, gambling. Even if you put all the pieces together and make the wisest investment possible, nobody knows what the future will bring. Luck is involved. I'm not trying to discredit you and say it was 100% luck, and I also feel somewhat clever in hindsight of my investment. I just think you may be getting a little carried away, friend.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:39:22
The people who make the rules made a rule saying they could do it? Seems legit. You don't see any harm in the printing of money being privatized? They decide to print more money, our money gets inflated. A private, non-auditable organization should not have control of the country's money.

I don't work, I am in college. However, the fact that people get arrested for not paying federal income taxes doesn't mean it is justified and covered by the constitution. State taxes are different. Like I said, search for the law yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:43:49
Sure they would disagree, because they don't know the constitution. They are charged with evasion of something that is not demanded by the constitution. People go along with it, so it works. Similar to people paying "protection money" so they don't get hurt. Sadly, it doesn't matter at this point that there is no law that can be found that justifies incarceration. Everybody (including myself) is too scared not to pay taxes in fear of the unjustified consequences.

The people who chose not to invest also work for money, they just did other things with it. Sure, I read and learned about it because it interested me. It was information easily obtained in my spare time, nothing pressing. The people who chose not to invest probably read other things and learn other things. Just because we have different paths does not mean one works harder than the other. You took a risk that paid off. They chose to avoid the risk and keep their money safe. Both approaches have reasoning behind them.

There is technically no law requiring people to pay federal income tax. That's why it is taken directly out of the paycheck, or else nobody would do it. There have been countless workers for the IRS that have gone searching for the law that requires people to pay federal income tax. When they fail to find it, they quit and stop paying taxes.
