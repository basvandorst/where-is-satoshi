In order to acquire bitcoins for your wallet, you will have to:
* Have a bank account
* Have credit card
* Meet a stranger face to face and exchange cash for bitcoins.
From what you describe, only the last option is available to you.
What do you want a bitcoin wallet for?

Will goods ever not be priced against another currency (e.g. USD)?
If I ask how much a GeForce GTX 770 costs (roughly) in BTC. I assume one checks the USD price (or other currency) then converts it using bitcoinwisdom/coinbase/what have you.
Will there ever be a time when the value of things can be gauged in BTC directly? How?
Many people on this sub claim that the USD is unsustainable (inflating out of control) and will eventually collapse. When that happens, how will US retailers price their goods in BTC?

There can only be one cash out indeed (times however many whales there are). However it could, in my opinion, be enough to irreversibly shake up the confidence in the bitcoin economy.
Is there $300million worth of btc in the exchanges' order books? If Karpeles/whoever stole the coin decide to cash out, that's $300m needed pretty much instantly. As the buy orders chip away at the 300m, it'll likely be more like 200ish (or less) but it's still a very large sum of money that needs to be injected into the bitcoin economy. The "yay cheap coins" posts are cheap (free) to post on reddit but when facing what would be a bank run, I'm not sure we'll see people actually going through with it.
To brush it off as a "we'll just absorb the price dip and carry on" is pretty optimistic to say the least. Time will tell I suppose, or maybe not.

Bitcoin price has little to do with what I'm asking. Even less to do with slavery.
I'm asking about the number of coins people already have (regardless of whether they're worth $1 or $10,000). It feels like new user are entering a game of monopoly where a few players already have more than half the money out of the bank. You can either buy from them, or roll the dice and hope to get coins from the ever-diminishing bank vault (mining).
It just doesn't seem that attractive to me.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:34:16
Is it still early adoption when more than half of all the coins that will ever exist are already in circulation?

So your answer would've been completely different if I'd removed 6 words from my original post? (i.e. *like the 1% elites of today*).
If so, I'd like to hear it please.

If the $ crashed, how would an american retailer price their goods in BTC?
Forgetting USD/BTC ratio (since hypothetically USD would be near worthless), how many BTC would a top-end PC be worth?

A non-issue? I don't think it is for people already 'convinced' to define it as an issue or non-issue. I'm currently from the outside looking in and it seems like a huge issue. If you dismiss it lightly, it will add the things preventing me (and others) from joining. If there is a good explanation as why I shouldn't worry, I'm happy to listen.

So this international business will have to first buy bitcoins (using USD or other FIAT), then sell those bitcoins to Argentinians in order to get ARS?
What's to be gained here for this imaginary international company?

Hey guys I'm also an early adopter and definitely not a desperate "investor" trying to stop a haemorrhage. You should certainly listen to my unsubstantiated claims that I give you with no credentials or no evidence whatsoever!

If that's a lucrative operation, I suppose any export company can do it in any country where there is btc demand.
The 'lucrative' part is the tricky bit tho.

Short answer: Not worth it.
Longish answer: Easiest way to start would be to approach it the way a late-comer would approach a booming IT technology. You need to be either 1) intelligent enough to think of a revolutionary way to mining coins that hasn't been thought before (we're talking math-genius territory) or 2) invest very large sums of money, probably high 6, low 7-figures and pray that you will make you money back in the next 12-24 months.
Bottom line is: The "mining-in-your-room-while-you-attend-classes" era is long long gone. It's now a big boy's game where the big fish crushes the little fish.

Bitcoin (like most things) is worth only as much as people are willing to pay for.
If you've got the market cornered, you can dictate your prices. Simple example of an unregulated market.

Seems like a pretty far-fetched scenario. A company having substantial ARS expenses but no ARS revenue that they could use to pay such expenses?
What are some example of such companies/businesses?

Bitcoiners hoping to see bitcoin succeed believe it will succeed.
More shocking news at 10.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:51:39
People accept dollars despite its many flaws because it's the world's currency (and arguably the world's religion).
Bitcoin doesn't have that luxury and still needs to prove itself. A simple example of this is the army of bitcoiners endlessly promoting the gospel of bitcoin. If bitcoin was so brilliant, it would grow organically without a need to be pushed onto people incessantly.
But I digress; I still see wealth distribution as a big hurdle to increased adoption. Telling me that the big bad dollar is ten times worse doesn't appease my worries on this matter.
The big bitcoin fans are in, and have been for a long time. The investors (with a healthy risk appetite) are in. The techno-savvy entrepreneurs are getting in at a good rate. But what about the rest? I do believe that in order to attract the more common people (like myself), bitcoin will have to answer the more common questions. Not by mocking or belittling the USD or other established system but by providing simple and convincing answers to basic questions. I often get hit back with borderline conspiracy-level answers when I ask pretty basic economics questions about btc.

Whatever you decide to call the phenomenon, I believe it is the cause of the big drop in donations.

Many consider Bitcoin to be in its infancy still, with the best yet to come. The words 'early adopter' are thrown around quite often when describing current users. However, more than half of all the coins that will ever exists have already been mined. This means that more than half of the "bitcoin wealth" that will ever exist is already in the hands of a select few.
Isn't that a very skewed system that will create a tiny privileged class and leave an overwhelming majority of the world in "bitcoin poverty"?
Won't this wealth gap lead to some scenarios where people either:
- become very envious and 'riot' against the bitcoin rich (like the 1% elites of today) or 
- become disinterested in a coin game where other players already have a huge head start?
How do we attract several billions of new players to a game when over half the chips have already been handed out to a couple million people?
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:59:04
I see your point but my question wasn't so much about availability or usability but more about 'backing' and valuation.
Coinbase is a blessing and a curse in that it allows any and everything to be sold for bitcoins*.
*^(not really for bitcoins if you prefer dollars/euros/others, we can do it, no problem!.)
I'm asking what will be the basis of valuation of 'things' (in btc) if other currencies spiral out of control.
For example, when the Argentinian pesos shit itself, many people revert to USD because it's a safe value (for now).
When many (all?) inflationary economy eventually collapse under their own flaws (as is often preached on this sub), will people flock to BTC? And if so, how will the sellers, the barterers and everyday users of bitcoins know how much things are worth.
That's what's leaving me puzzled.

John and Audrey both have accounts with Coinbase. They both have 10 BTC on their account. John decides to give all his BTC to Audrey and does so. The computer at coinbase sets John's balance to 0 and Audrey's to 20.

Simple answer: Once BTC value started rocketing late 2013, everyone got greedy and started hoarding. Now that the trend is slightly downward, everyone continues to hoard in the hope to catch the next upward swing.
It's quite simple really.

What's the general/popular opinion on the growing trend of off-chain transactions and payment processors stealing the spotlight?
Seems the likes of coinbase/bitpay are spearheading the bitcoin mainstream adoption which is promising. However (IMO) their model goes against the 'spirit' of bitcoin which is to keep things decentralised and free from a single point of failure/control.
Anyone worried about this trend?
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:32:08
Not the wealth of other but rather the disproportionate distribution. If Satoshi comes out of hiding and cashes out, that'd be devastating for bitcoin. If Karpeles, or whoever stole the coins cashes out, that'd be a big blow for bitcoin. There are a few big fishes that can have huge impact on the bitcoin ecosystem and that's what's worrying. Them being rich is not really a worry to me (it just makes me jealous oviously).
