I have lately had paypal and my insurance company make charges to my bank account that I did not authorize and this caused fees from my bank. Then my bank charged fees for being over drawn from other fees.
When it was said and done I was charged $130 in fees simply because paypal and my insurance withdrew from my savings as opposed to my debit card and overdrew by $10.
So simply because I didn't have an extra $10 in my savings (which I did not authorize them to take from) my bank expected me to pay $130 in fees.

It shouldn't be to hard to pick up something for a decent price that will make you money.. 
Learn about Bitcoin difficulty and how it is predicted, it will help you determine what the best price to pay for the best machine will be.. realize that these $2,000 miners will be worth $500 in 3 months.. learn what miners are out there and what they are capable of and get a good idea for what you will want..
Realize that new miners are being released all the time and when they are - people dump what they have on ebay to get the new stuff. 
The first couple to hit ebay will be WAY overpriced, patience pays off. Wait until the market is saturated and snag the best deal because you will know what the difficulty is and what the best price to pay will be. 
2015, fuck yeah.

My friend asked me to get out of bitcoin last night.. He is one of my more skeptical friends, pretty negative and will pretty much support the unpopular opinion just to take the contrary position. 
He asked if I could transfer bitcoin to my bank account on the spot and I said yes pulling up my coinbase account. I sat there with my finger on the trigger and declined. I'm not going to do this just to make a point. "Why not? Cause it won't go through?"
I reached the point in the conversation where I was done indulging his idiotic argument. 
"No, I'm not going to do it because I make money simply off of the bitcoin in my holdings. I'm making money mining and off of dividends from bitcoin based businesses" I replied.
"Yeah but you can't spend that money!"
Lesson: some people are just trolls.

This community has warned against Mt. Gox repeatedly. When I decided to jump in I did research and followed common sense. That common sense led me to Coinbase, whom I trust entirely. Those who stayed on Gox knew the risks. 
As a result I still have all my money. What we are seeing today is probably the lowest point bitcoin will be at all year. 
There were two entities whose existence was detrimental to the positive growth of bitcoin. With Silk Road and Mt. Gox out of the way the confidence level in bitcoin will only go up. If anything the fall of gox is a sign that the coast is clear to start investing.

Gpu mining on a Mac is worthless. I tried it. Coinwarz.com will tell you how much money you could make.. If you to make any money at all on a Mac you need an asic device. Whatever you get you should be spending $5 per gigahash or less if you can . Example: you can get a 180 gh/s ant miner s1 on ebay for $849 right now. That's $4.71/gh/s and it probably gonna be the best deal you can get unless you find a 1T hash asic for less than $4000.

If we are really thinking about the future then let's think about the future. 
As we lose jobs to automation and robots the structure of our society will change. We will either have a guaranteed base income or a more socialist state where unemployment skyrockets but it will just become a normal thing. Population controls will probably put restrictions on how many children a family can have and that will influence the amount of people who can be gainfully employed vs the Non working class who will probably be enrolled into state run programs, colleges, military, ect.
Eventually you won't be paid a salary so much as a base pay with an added percentage based on your contribution and level of skill. Crypto currency could play a big role in this new system. We will probably switch to a credit based economy in the next fifty years. Governments will come up with their own digital transfer systems to be managed by the banks, which will become their new role in society - to serve as public ledger.
By the time you get a paycheck in 2035 it will most likely be a debit into a digital account that is issued to you at birth much like a ssn. This account will be controlled and managed by a bank acting on the governments behave. When it actually come time to spend your money you will probably have to make a request into whatever becomes the physical medium, be it bitcoin, usd, or something totally new but I imagine there will be several options. 
So by the time you factor your minimum base level income and your percentage your pay won't be that far off from everyone else's. Your food and basic needs will be met by your base level income. Your medical expenses will be covered by the state. The only thing your money will actually go into it frills, and luxury items, hobbies, and whatnot. 
Or we could be ruled by corporations and I could end up being totally wrong.

I agree.. I have several bitcoins but even if I'm living on the streets homeless I wouldn't cash them in. Bitcoins future potential is so much greater than many realize.. Even if it hit $10,000 - I'd only cash out maybe half.. This currency will be generated until the year 2140 - I equate my current holdings to getting IPOs of coca cola and apple when they first hit the market.. 
The long term potential outweighs everything at this moment in time.

I first heard about it several years ago messing around with the dark net and for network. I logged onto Silk Road and saw the bitcoin symbol weighing in @ $3/1btc.  A few months later I return and see the price has grown to $100/btc. 
I started looking into getting some but at the point the only place I could find was gox and they were only accepting cashiers check or money order.. Too risky..
I forgot about it for a while and then boom btc hit 1,200. I started back peddling and investing $100 of each paycheck and then I started mining.. As of today I have a whole bitcoin. And with my mining and investments I pull in around .01 - .03 per day.

The "question" you ask has an insulting tone to it in case you haven't figured that out.

Storing vast sums of money for nothing.. Typically if you had a million dollars and tried to take it to a bank they would tell you that it is only insurable to $250,000. Aside from keeping yourself armed to keep your loot or finding a place to secure it yourself - you put it in bitcoin and what you get back would be a single key, written on a piece of paper that can be hidden anywhere. You could literally hide millions of dollars in the pages of your favorite book.

Ebay. The antminer s2 cost my $350 and makes about $5.00/day - I will make my money back in about 3 months, after that it's all profit. I just buy them and once you spend a single frustrating day setting them up the upkeep is very simple - you get used to the noise and they just run.. 
I keep them next to a window, they've been running constantly since Feb/March 14. I've made about 2.3 bitcoins total mining. 
People say - "just buy Bitcoin" but I think mining is fun. You get to sit and watch your machine make Bitcoins.. I can switch pools - over the summer I mined the fuck out of new altcoins and dumped them on the exchanges. I made a lot of money that way. Mining Bitcoin is worth it.. You can't expect to make significant money doing it but it's fun and you develop a deeper respect for the process of mining and Bitcoin too.
You can get many small cheaper units. The smaller you go the less you will make and more expensive the equipment will be ($/gh).. If you want to learn about the process then it's totally worth it to spend $20 on a gridseed 5-chip orb or an ANTMINER U2 or U3.. but you won't make money.
To make money you would have to get a deal on a miner where you are paying $1 for 3 gh/s. or better. You can get close but you will need free electricity to make money (Electricity is free in my flat ;) .. But you won't make anything significant without spending $300+..

I don't see bitcoin as being a primary mode of transactions in the future but rather relying a different, faster coin or set of coins that are intrinsically engrained into bitcoins protocol.
I see bitcoin as virtual gold. It will be store of value for other coins. Sure you can pay for things with it but for the most part you will keep it in cold storage and only break it out when you need more doge, lite, name, peer or whatever kind of currency is used to actually transactions. 
In five years time bitcoin will simply be to valuable to carry around on you. Sometime after the initial mainstream adoption efforts will be made to make it simpler, and safer to use and a secondary currency will be implemented to perform this function. 
Maybe they adopt an existing coin. Maybe they start making companion coins to bitcoin: minibit, bitusd, bitjap. 
But anyways that's how I see it going down.

Yeah. Personally I believe that there is a campaign to discredit bitcoin. It is coming from the banks but they can't let it look like it's coming from them because that is exactly what would cause bitcoin to blow up. So they enlist their politician friends, their friends who work in news. If any of these entities wanted to play up the positive aspects they could. There is also a huge difference with the type of coverage between the mainstream news and the financial news.. 
Mainstream news really focuses on the sensationalism, they paint it as a taboo reserved for hackers and drug dealers. Articles on Forbes and other financial sites tend to pride themselves on the research they put into it because people actually expect financial advice from these types of sites.

The changes were denied cause I don't keep that much on my cards..

Well there is that. I mean it isn't the most secure method but by identifier I mean something so you know what it is.. Like foobarGmale vs foobarBtC vs foobarFac3b00k... Adding numbers instead of letters is great too.

Why not use bitcoin as a payment for undistributed films. Keep it DIY 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:56:33
You should just buy one. I know you may not want to but you will put in just as much time and energy if not more to get a free one than to get the money to buy one. It's like you're going out of your way to be lazy about it.

Hey you know the image that people associate with bitcoin? Ya the one we've been using for five years. Let's take it and add another "symbol" in there. 
Ugh.

I'm in for about 1.5 purchased between $500 - $890. I'm holding until at least the halving of 2016, maybe longer.

I kind of saw it as being an encrypted USB stick wallet that doubles as cold storage.

Adafruit Dropped the Ball!! I just got a 10% discount using promo code BITCOINBF, when the page refreshed at the top it says save 15% with promo code BLACKFRIDAY... SO you get LESS of a discount for Bitcoin Black Friday than regular Black Friday? WTF?!?!?
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:08:05
I agree, unfortunately I think the average person who doesn't know any better would jump at the chance to keep crypto in a bank where it's "safe". This is of course missing the point entirely - which is my worst fear: An amazing protocol like bitcoin being hijacked by the system it was created to escape from.

a. In my mind I saw a bot that constantly monitors the hashing rate and then communicates that info to the pool.
b. The idea is to have miners from every pool dedicated to the cause so at the time of switchover it would pull miners from the pool in question.

And there it is. This is one of the major elements of mainstream adoption.

Yeah. Same here. Weeaboo level 5000. Exactly what I would expect the emperor of dogecoin to sound like.

I believe it will start with an in-house protocol. Then they will develop an app that connects your bank account to a digital wallet to kill Venmo and other digital cash payment apps. By then most other banks will be in tow and crypto will be the next hurdle. They will start an exceptance program to buy crypto from users at a reduced rate to get cash into their bank program - a major bank reversing their decision to buy bitcoin but not sell it will create massive sell off and price decline in bitcoin as people realize they can easily go legit. Once they’ve driven the price down enough they will open an exchange to trade at a premium - selling people back their bitcoin after that crash the market. Just a theory though because the idea that they only want an in-house protocol doesn’t add up in my opinion.

I read it differently. By entering the space they are attempting to create a narrative. And I believe that that narrative will be: 
“When you use our cryptocurrency the dollars are in our bank, you can see them. When you use Bitcoin where is that money?”
Mark my words they will use their coin as a way to cast doubt on other crypto, drive the price down while they buy and THEN allow customers to buy crypto from them - I imagine this process will take about two years to complete.

Bs. I've traveled the us on Bitcoin - once you have it you are good 
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:02:05
There are two Bitcoin ATMs within a mile of my house. Seems pretty unfair to only try to buy on exchanges and then say you've been having trouble buying "all day". It's Bitcoin, you can get it faster than a Visa card if you really want to, just takes research.

Wow!! A lot of no's. I came here to say no as well. The halving is coming up - buy Bitcoin instead

No I had more than 5500 in my account and tried to withdraw 5500 and they told me that same day cash withdraws have to be less than 5000

Coinbase but it would take a couple of days to get, you could initiate order today though.
@_date: 2015-10-23 14:08:19
If you have less than $5000 in your account then yes. I went to my bank a few months ago and tried to take out $5500 and was told it simply couldn't happen, that I had to give 24 hours notice.
