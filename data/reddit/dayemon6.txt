He has been saying for awhile now, take what you would throw away on a weekend out, that is what you can afford to lose. So taking your family to a movie theater for $100+ or put it in bitcoin and just don't go to the movies that weekend. Seems like pretty decent advice to me.

You mean flavor-aid 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:59:33
I was always 100% put in the trezor and hold. But I'm not so sure with segwitx2...this time I might actually keep on exchange so I can make decisions quickly, instead of being locked in cold storage, not knowing when you will have access to the new coins.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:20:20
I was worried too that I've been day trading. But I have no worries the segwitx2 will f everything up anyway, and there will be a good time to buy back in low.

Am not Chinese, but can drink beer and play darts. How much is the security deposit?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:18:16
Yes move usd from bank account to coinbase. Then free transfer to Gdax.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:01:23
Here is the link describes it all

Buy on Gdax next time for no fee. Christ thats a large fee.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:58:23
There is a lot of this going on. They usually never actually mine. They are just Ponzi schemes, if it just started up you can usually milk a few bucks until they run out of new subs, and shut down and run.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:15:19
I know. But no one really knows what is going to happen with the gold split on the 25th with coins in cold storage on a trezor. With no replay protection I don't think they want to support them.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:49:32
Well out of all the exchanges I wouldn't think coinbase would just disappear tomorrow, but the point is any fiat/coins left on an exchange are not owned by you unless you own the private key. That is one risk. 2nd is during splits, you put trust into whoever is holding your coins to disperse the split coins to you. If you own the key then you control what happens to the split coins.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:01:25
Well at the very least you can just deposit your fiat in coinbase and only use Gdax platform to trade for free with 0 fees. The only fee I ever pay is the miner fee from transferring coin from hardware wallet to gdax.

I tried to pitch a movie. But I didn't make past Harvey Weinstein's casting couch. That guy was all hands.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:10:28
Basicly when you ach transfer, it's the fiat banking system fucking you. For me after like 5 business days I see it posted to by bank as a pending transaction. The very next day, I see it went through and posted from my bank in the morning, and then at 12pm est time like clockwork, I have access to the money in coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:03:24
Problem is coinbase only lets you buy $150 per week with a credit card. Extremely annoying since my bank wont seem to allow any transactions through my bank account.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:45:17
You sir are a fucking genius 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:55:10
I'm just surprised that gdax doesn't have that option like coinbase does. Prob for security reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:19:35
Do hookers accept bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:22:54
Yeah I watched a thread on that. You could make like 25 fake accounts with the free money they gave you. You could also watch their wallet to see when they were gonna fold. I couldn't get into it early enough so I just watched for entertainment.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:15:48
Use Gdax and transfer your fiat from coinbase with no fee. Then buy bitcoin on Gdax using a limit order for no fee. Then send bitcoin from Gdax to wallet for no fee. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:46:52
Yeah they have been saying this for awhile now but I never see it happen. Maybe next year.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:45:59

Assuming it is still an allegation, but didn't the FBI "fake" torture someone on video he supposedly paid to have killed?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:51:10
Agreed. I will never use the metric system when it comes to measuring length.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:56:48
Well if they are gonna go all FDR tax rate on us, I guess the IRS will have to get my private keys for my trezor through torture, which should also be legal by then. They will probably have to ban guns first as well.

I plan on putting my coins in cold storage on a Trezor before the split, what problems did they have last time?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:58:45
Crazy. They broadcast the NFL players making political statements by taking a knee all day long. Guess that freedom doesn't apply to you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:37:12
If holding and safety is your concern get the trezor. Send your coins to gdax from coinbase for free, then send from gdax to trezor for free. Then hold and ride out the split sometime around nov. 18th and watch what happens after.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:02:04
Ah yes. Social Security. That ponzi scheme is gonna make Bernie Madoff look like little rookie bitch. All in due time.

A damn fine dinner off the $1 menu at McDonalds, then buy more at the dip this morning.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:33:51
The price was around $2500 when I first started. The shitty limits of how much you are allowed to spend per week on the exchanges, by debit/credit and the bank account limits were a serious bar of entry for me. I would have liked to have bought big then, but because of those limits I lost out and I almost said fuck it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:50:55
Smuggling gold in the ass. Genius!
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:32:27
You make a great point. I too am interested to see how millennials and future generations cope with this buzz word of sustainability. Personally I believe the politically motivated global warming/climate change or whatever double speak it transforms into over the years,is bullshit used to control us. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be looking for more efficient ways to maintain the block chain.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:49:58
I have never been charged a fee if you send to wallet from gdax. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:58:26
They would do a withdrawal every 4 days like clockwork. So you knew when their wallet got low they would make up an excuse of no pay out until new "investors" paid in. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:31:00
Same here. Mostly gold nuggets found in the walls and dollars spread out among book pages. That generation understood exactly what can happen to fiat. Skip a few generations and that attitude has been lost. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:51:17
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:58:59
Right now it is more of a store of value than a currency.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:21:12
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:11:54
Kinda funny though, can move .3 coin from trezor with a .91cent fee to gdax in less than an hour....but it takes a week to move fiat to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:21:40
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:40:53
Well check this out.  The bitgold devs couldn't even figure out how to implement it themselves and put a worthless 250btg bounty out for someone else to write the code...
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:44:26
Do these coins need to be in your own private wallet before Oct. 25th to get them?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:46:45
Transfer fiat from coinbase to gdax for free. Then buy bitcoin with limit order for free. Then send coin to wallet for free. EZPZ 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:32:59
Sweet another ponzi scheme to take advantage of.

No proof it will. Only proof they are still working on it.

just hit 6400 I would not buy right now
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:52:33
It looks like Trezor hasn't released a statement on what they plan on doing for gold yet.

An hour pending on coinbase now to get off the exchange into a trezor.

Can I still buy a nice house in Detroit for $1 with plywood windows?
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:37:52
Also consider using your bank account to move cash with the 7 day waiting period to your cash account in coinbase. Then transfer for free and instantly to Gdax.com account so you can buy on the exchange for free with no fees.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:48:54
I agree. You don't have to maintain an outrageous style of living like everyone expects you too. I could easily live off that.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:56:08
I heard a number today that it would cost you ~$31 billion to control that much mining power to double spend a coin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:35:06
I'd can't tell from the 5 secs I looked st their site, but there are a ton of Ponzi schemes going on like this, usually fake mining scams. Rule of thumb if it just started you can take some profits before they collapse.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:05:52
Deposit ach always sucks....but you can transfer your USD to Gdax instantly and trade for free directly on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:23:55
For the Trezor! You know the Trezor! What did you think I meant?

@_date: 2017-10-24 02:47:49
Exactly. Their website makes everyone think it has protection right after the fork. Bullshit.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:13:24
Can't speak for Europe. But in US gdax is free to buy and sell with limit orders. Free as well to transfer fiat from coinbase to gdax. Also free to send bitcoin from gdax to a wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:51:50
It will come down a bit, it's too high right now, just wait for it, or put a limit buy order on exchange for a lower price and hope it hits around 3-4am 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:49:25
So i just copy and paste this right? oh wait...
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:34:01
Well like I said the person didn't actually die but FBI made him think he was killed.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:11:21
So it's not a good idea to use my 24 trezor seed as 24 different passwords on 24 different porn sites?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:48:48
That is what is great about trezor. You can have all the malware you want on that windows puter. It will not affect your transfers at all. That is the purpose of cold storage.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:00:39
I prefer Champion Edition.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:24:31
I thought about that but that seems kinda risky, even though it is just a public key. But it still exposes that transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:35:08
Free to send from gdax. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:13:20
Tee hee 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:43:45
7 days to clear into USD account on coinbase. Then that money in your USD account can be transferred to Gdax instantly, and you can buy and sell instantly with a fee or free with a limit order to buy or sell.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:19:24
When is this shit gonna crash?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:54:53
Wow that is scary. That site claims they have replay protection when they don't. Fucking scammers.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:35:29
The bank transfers are always ACH and take forever. Best bet if your doing small transactions anyway is to link a credit card. You will be able to buy $150 per week instantly with the card. The $150 limit slowly refills over a week.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:52:54
There you go giving them ideas 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:19:11
I'm standing in line at a wawa trying to buy a coffee and my debit card is being declined. Thanks coinbase!
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:56:50
Lol very true.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:05:50
Yeah they just knocked my credit card limit from a pathetic $150/week down to $100/week for no reason. Been member for 2 or 3 months now. Oh well their loss, I will just stop buying with a cc all together and they lose the fee's while I buy for free on gdax.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:42:22
It's not coinbase. It's the fiat ach banking system. Happens every time until it clears.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:26:09
I like to keep gdax logged in on my ipad throughout the day. How else am I supposed to operate dangerous heavy machinery, while watching the market and making trades at the same time?

Really? I did not know this.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:45:45
Use the public key address where you sent the funds to look to see if the transaction was confirmed on the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-10-31 21:07:05
Just get into cold storage before fork no problem.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:52:46
If I were you I'd just move your coins to a private wallet and bunker down til the dust settles. If you sell for fiat your just gonna leave that on the exchange while waiting 7 days for the ach transaction, which is pointless.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:04:58
Could be a number of reasons. From lack of evidence, to the corruption of cops, to not handling it properly,  etc. ect.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:41:58
It's what the shitty limits on coinbase are for. I'm still stuck at $150 per week. But if someone stole your credit card they wouldn't be able to spend 10's of 1000's in an instant.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:42
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:26:45
Coinbase then transfer to Gdax to buy for free. Then back to coinbase to send to wallet/hardware wallet.
