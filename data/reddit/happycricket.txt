Pretty sure he means that if Greece spirals out of control there is a short term opportunity for bitcoin to go higher.

The best article I have read so far about bitcoin. The author does a great job of spelling out the overall "vision" of bitcoin.

Everybody likes free money....and its critical to get bitcoins into as many pockets as possible. I can't think of a better way to raise awareness than giving bits to somebody that doesn't have any.

Agreed, my first twitter tip went uncollected. I'm sure it looked like random spam from an unknown follower. Facebook will be different. 200 bits @_date: 2014-12-12 15:09:21
Yes...can we squeeze another layer in there?

Good to know. Thanks. 200 bits @_date: 2014-11-12 01:33:47

I've been using Trezor for a while. I haven't had a single issue with it. I use is as a convenient form of long term storage, not as an everyday use device.

This incident forced Bitstamp to becoming stronger. Probably needed to be done a long time ago, but its not easy to make the massive updates that they were able to make without shutting down for a few days. 
Just another example of how resilient the Bitcoin ecosystem is.

Great list. If a journalist could really predict the future, then they wouldn't choose journalism as a profession. These predictions are great click bait but really have no value beyond that. 500 u/change tip

Bitcoin price is going up again.....send out the muppet!

Tipped a cup of coffee. He may be too busy to even accept it....but I think this is a great way for podcasters to accept support from their listeners.

Agreed. This "blockchain is the real technology" meme is just a way to dismiss the real threat of bitcoin. People continue to repeat it, but it just I don't think most of these people really understand what they are saying.

Jeremy Alliare published this just a couple of weeks ago. Doesn't sound like he's erasing Bitcoin to me.

It did happen. I can confirm that I'm in this email. Rather than sending individual emails, one large group email was sent about duplicate order confirmations.

Good day to be a PokerStars competitor.

It was pegged to the USD Value....so its not a contained bitcoin ecosystem as of yet.
