Sure seems like it lol
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:28:01
Really!! That's great!

Which is...when?? Lol
@_date: 2015-12-31 22:03:10
I think you're on point and being objective. Seems like there's some super intense drama that someone's trying to take you into though lol

"Eh um hmmm uhhhh"
The musical sounds of an old-world economist trying to stay consistent when all he knows is now wrong

Wow. That was surprisingly tame for Fox News. Barry held it down.
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:33:03
Yes. Awesome. Unsolicited feedback: turn down the rap vocal a touch (or wash it in more reverb) to let it meld and allow the listener to lean in. Typography is a bit plain and static. Use element 3D to make some grimy 3D type that evolves. Great job.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:29:35
Awesome job! Coupon?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:52:08
That's a problem akin to a bait and switch in the value proposition. I'm not a fan.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:52:56
That's an awesome one. I'd imagine you would only use that analogy with people who understand the depth of genetic diversity...a somewhat complicated topic considering that a large majority of our DNA is actually identical

Are ulterior motives and conflicts of interest the same thing? With a coi you might not even be consciously aware of what you're doing and saying differently in order to satisfy your subconscious desire to keep the dollars flowing. Doesn't an ulterior motive imply that a person is consciously scheming?

Is ignoring that fiduciary responsibility really a crime?! Im aware of the law you're talking about and I've heard this point before but it just doesn't seem to make sense. Case in point: is RIM (blackberry) liable for criminal penalties for their record breaking losses as of late? How about the companies of the dot com bubble??

You must not understand investing. The above statement holds true for any asset worth holding.
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:17:28
you could also just pump the price up like a whale and then skim off the top when people see the movement and buy in...I think it's equivalent to spreading misleading news
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:12:14
Maybe just an interactive tutorial with affiliate links to coinbase... that could be pretty successful for you Sir. Good luck! I love the idea!

Seriously... his get away so far has been anything but clean. There's no way in hell he'd still be in the public eye (unless he's the worst con man ever) if he had planned this job since back in 2011. He had plenty of time to plan some sort of get-away!

I don't like how with mycelium it doesn't convert fiat amounts you have to do the calculation yourself. Clunky! Other clients such as the "bitcoin" client (Andreas Schildbach) allow this functionality and it makes the process of payments WAAAY easier.
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:26:41
They still think bitcoin is a company
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:24:51
It doesn't matter. You don't have to wait for them.

Plz explain why...I agree..just curious why you think that
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:42:46
I'm not sure about that. I read a pretty good book called "Beyond the Keynesian Endpoint..." by Tony Crescenzi. It laid out an incredibly sound economic basis for why it is no longer feasible to think that monetary authorities are capable of printing their way out of the next collapse. Very interesting. Similar to some of the stuff that Peter Schiff would say but without the douchey ultralibertarianism and gold worship.

Actually, they made the wrong call by writing pro-bitcoin articles and *telling* their readers that they were invested in it. MSM is always invested in the shit they hype, they just don't *tell* their viewers.

I was wondering what would come of this lol
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:58:30
it's a common misconception that the federal government's job is to tell the states what they can and can't do. That all started with the civil rights mov't (which obviously was a good thing) and has been going awry ever since. The founders of this country intended that every state should be its own experiment. If you don't like the bible thumping in Oklahoma, move to Cali...etc...While of course the constitution draws the boundaries for those experiments. That's how the founders wanted it.
That's not what we're getting these days. Centralized power grab.

@_date: 2014-02-19 03:30:43
Hmmmm....well, I can see a bit of cronyism potential derailing the idea. Let's say one of the cc companies sees it coming and comes to the table with a concession to die for...but whatever offer they make would hit their bottom line/earnings pretty damn hard and I doubt their egos could face it
Meanwhile, it would only be a matter of time before other companies adopted the idea and demanded similar concessions....etc....the free market absolves old technologies of their dominant roles quite well over time so if the idea has obstacles they will most definitely be in the form of non-freemarket antics dreamt up by the incumbents

What we need is a maximized supply chain that can meet and beat the lowest prices offered on the internet because of it's ability to accept bitcoin.

I've been thinking of similar ways that the network will be transparently 'hijacked' by bigger entities that see profit potential by cutting out the middle man. What you've explained is exactly the kind of thing that will push btc into the mainstream... Without the mainstream having a choice in the matter :)

How about you could create a "class balance" for each student that could be increased or decreased by all sorts of things at the professor's discretion. Lets say he wants a phone free day and puts up a $50 bounty that comes out of a slush fund required of each student at the beginning of the semester. Then an app counts the amount of times the phone moves during the class and reports it to the professor and effects their payout...or payin...and then the phones that don't move get payouts of the fund?? Just rambling

I think it would be interesting to see. If our dollar is hit then the Chinese will stop sending us cheap shit to sell at Walmart because most people won't be able to afford it anymore.

Exactly. Just use dollars. You are not at all in tune with what makes bitcoin awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:50:01
How are you gonna pay for it? By credit card? Well then Walmart just lost 2-3% on the transaction. A lot of the benefits of bitcoin will be realized by the retailer and that's why they'll adopt it.
They're the customer essentially...they're the ones who have a variety of payment processing technologies to choose from, each having its own cost structure. Bitcoin (&lt;1% fees) sits alongside credit cards (2-4% fees) in the market and that's why businesses are adopting it. Really, the main obstacle to adoption at this point is volatility and that's addressed by OP.

I agree to some extent but you must recognize the amount of bribery it took for them to attain their dominant position. I like that OP is quantifying  part of the impact he's making by using bitcoin. I'd go even further and say that every $100 Visa or WU don't get matters because it's $100 less for them to go bribe Congress with for the purpose of suppressing future financial innovation.

It would be cool if there was a framework for automatically granting credentials to a customer from whom you've received bitcoin based on their ability to sign a message from the address they sent the bitcoin from. I was thinking about this in context of beta releases for crowd funded projects. People would be incentivised to donate more if they knew that it would give them exclusive access to the end product.

I have a feeling it has to do with the elegance of the solutions being proposed. Maybe the bitcoin protocol could use a little elegance. The other day I tried to pay a friend using electrum on my mac and I had to manually type in his public address and manually calculate the mBTC amount. Not saying this is what glyph offered, but this might be part of the issue. They are crazy about that shit.

U have a bit of reading to do sir

Probably won't break even. Those boards are expensive!

wtf am I missing something

Actually,  this same exact thing happened to me at PIA about a week ago :( I'm corresponding with tech support via 1 msg per day but they still have failed to send me my login cred
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:24:20
Fuck yes again. I'm doing this.

There is some epic stuff in that little exchange at the end. Really good article even if the author doesnt fully understand the implications.

I registered an account and it looks like the service is priced in bitcoins...does that mean that the subscription price is locked to the bitcoin exchange rate?? That seems like it would be a deal breaker for a lot of customers.

Being a prick??? Where did THAT come from? Would he be a prick if he was selling on localbitcoins?

The only rookie mistake is seeing those as rookie mistakes. Every rookie looks back and sees "I should have played that trend.... and that one, and that one, and that one..."

How does a patron tip the bartender as part of their bill? Just wondering how you handle this...
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:33:51
Is that related to their run in with DHS in the US?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:32:44
So true. Central banks go to great lengths to control the market for the currencies they issue. In some ways that's all they really do. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:36:08
That is some bullshit. Rich people with massive influence exist in all religions. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:45:23
This is a BIG point I haven't heard mentioned elsewhere

Does the Google server store the OTP entries you have in the app?? So if I print out those ine time codes (for google auth) they can restore all OTP entries the app has even if I add more entries after I print the codes?

Some people do it but it's really cumbersome. ACH withdrawls take time, making it a lot different than what happens on wallstreet.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:18:25
Each ACH must be signed by the president

I like this point. Democracy as an idea had always had merit. Historically it has been difficult to execute in a way that serves the people. Now adays we have tools that could make the next iteration successful.

Won't let me cash out unless I have a balance  of 0.01 or greater (the catch!)
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:28:40
Interesting. I wonder about that. Can you explain why or how they wouldn't act rationally?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:16:01
Good job man. You'd be my favorite uncle for sure! Kids love stuff with official-ass holograms n shit lol Or at least I always did!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:18:21
I feel like I'm having this same problem right now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:23:13
Fuck yes
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:02:56
How can you be holding and not care if it hits 1 or 10,000? That's just irresponsible.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:11:48
But also only divest what you're willing to lose

Don't you think your 10% trailing stop would have left you out in the cold long before 1000% gains?...just look at the swings man they're gut wrenching. If you believe in it, buy and hold.
I'm not trying to tell you those same thoughts haven't been coursing through my head...they definitely have. I'm just saying I don't act on them because when I did I lost 60 btc ; (
Edit: oh..I see you mean start the trailing stop when you hit 1000% gains. That kinda makes sense. At that point I'd ask what if it doesn't hit 1000% gains before the pull back? What if it hits 999.89% is that still a rookie mistake?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:28:35
Does anyone know any details on cost structure for this thing?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:22:25
Catchy...very catchy brup!!
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:09:35
I haven't done this yet. Can someone please elaborate on what would happen in the following scenarios (or why they couldnt/wouldnt happen):
1. Seller gets the cash and refuses to release the btc to buyer
2. Buyer gets cash taken by seller (robbery)
3. Buyer gets the wrong amount of btc transferred
4. Seller is forced to transfer btc (robbery)
Sorry I'm paranoid
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:25:53
nice advice
