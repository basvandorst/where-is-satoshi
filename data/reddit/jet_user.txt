The ability of BTC users to use features of other coins via swaps will be limited by liquidity of those coins.

Small clarification: I mean it is https now and was http 3 months ago. Don't know if retroactively editing URL on reddit is okay, but I'd try it to aid linking discussions together.

Does it mean top 100 addresses will control block production?

Thanks for your reply. It is wise to only hold things you understand.
I asked because designing cryptocurrency protocols requires thinking through myriad possible attack vectors, and I noticed you had some concerns about the design in your article. I think existing implementations are worth examining precisely because they did tons of work to account for many of these attacks.
Perhaps this is also why it ended up so complicated. As I dig further I realize that all bits are necessary, but I agree it is more complex than Bitcoin. Incomplete or complex documentation didn't help either, although this has improved, as well as the GUI getting better at guiding the user. If you have any more feedback on showstoppers I'd be happy to collect it.

Yes! It reads like you're getting closer to Decred design.
I only wonder why you did not further look into it and/or mention in your article (Mar 7) if you were aware of it at the time of [this comment]( (Feb 6)? In a similar way Cobra also ignored the existence of Decred when discussing hybrid PoW+PoS design in his [open letter to change PoW](
Not seeking conspiracy, I just think it worth exploring the experience collected by the project digging this direction for _years_.
P.S. Seems your previous [article]( about voting on Bitcoin [submitted]( to r/Bitcoin was [censored]( =\

But from the OP


So voters can collectively decide which chain is valid, if the proposed hashpower-votingweight ratio is satisfied. This is what I call "control block production" - voter's don't produce the blocks directly but choose which blocks (chain) they accept, and reject the others. Am I following correctly?
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:23:03


Is this voting optional (not for every block)?
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:28:36
I can't see the post, what happened?
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:29:24
OP is reddit jargon for "original poster" but is often used to refer to initial post that started the thread.
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:11:01
Decred actually uses PoW+PoS hybrid described in [MC2 paper]( It's not based on Proof of Activity (common misconception), although PoA spurred to move faster and helped with the attack cost estimation and stakepool concept.
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:15:05


Not just a hard fork. Voters signing (approving) blocks is effectively a transfer of power from miners to coin voters. I doubt miners will voluntary relinquish power. If it ever comes to this hard fork it will be very contentious.

In a community you care about other people and what they think.

There is a hybrid PoW-PoS implementation that is in production for 2+ years: Decred.


The consensus is a set of 3 to 5 minters (stake voters) are randomly selected via deterministic algorithm that takes entropy from previous block header.
The process is better explained in the docs: [link]( [link]( [link](
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:55:53
If only OP shared his inspiration...
_spoiler: this is how it works in Decred for 2+ years_
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:25:36
Is he walking away?
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:47:19
Enjoyed the article, especially stressing the _trustless_ property at the end.
With many new people entering the space and figuring out things, it cannot be stressed enough what makes cryptos great. Better repeat core properties a few extra times as a proactive attack against silliness like which coin unit is cheaper or what coin has bigger blocks.
One thing I found inconvenient with this repost is that it uses different URL and differs only in http/https. Clicking 'other discussion' doesn't discover [previous discussion]( with 47 comments, so the discussion is scattered across several submissions.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:23:18
What if evil miners spin up more nodes to support their new consensus?
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:46:26
Sorry I didn't understand your point. I'm talking about coin holders (PoS miners) keeping PoW miners in check.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:36:52
Hope so. Segwit2x aborted so we didn't see what would happen. Could economic full nodes still win if 2x had more hashrate and longest chain?
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:49:54
Good point. Reminds [this post]( on ASIC resistance.
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:02:26
The author literally describes Decred without a single mention. I'm speechless.




The problem was foreseen in 2015 and explained in [these]( [three]( [posts](
I could tell more about the system if there is interest.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:47:36
It does cointain "Bitcoin" in title and is not "mostly about some other cryptocurrency", so sidebar check ok. Perhaps it violates some other rule?
I'm not surprised it's not a friendly place for altcoins, but some clarification for removal would make it look better.
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:34:42
PoS miners can strip reward of PoW miners if they misbehave.
