Oh, thought of something else. Say you have an alert set for the price going above $150. If its hovering between $149 and $150, are you going to keep getting alerts each time?

Are you being serious? You expect everyone to buy a netbook just to use Bitcoin without fear of it being stolen? If that's necessary, Bitcoin is not going to take off.

Awesome, thanks!

You can't use BTC on an iPhone, though, which I assume bitpwn has.

It doesn't look like there's a way to verify your cell phone, though. i.e. I could put in someone else's phone number and have them sent texts without their permission. Unless I'm missing something?
It does look, cool, though! I've signed myself up, thanks!
Edit: The cell phone verification has now been implemented. Thanks!

No, it's 13-14. You can figure it out the basic age for a grade by adding five because most people enter kindergarten at age five, making them six when they start 1st grade. Add a year to get the range for the kids whose birthdays are earlier in the year. There'll be some exceptions with kids who are born around the cutoff date (usually the end of August/beginning of September) and obviously kids who skip/repeat grades.

Ohh, I hadn't considered that. I was thinking about the fact that you can't buy them through the iPhone app. But you can buy them through the website using your iPhone, okay. Thanks!
