I'm loving some Ardor. Its a hedge for your hedge. A non Erc20 blockchain option. And its a direct child of the only functioning PoS network in existence (NXT). And I got tons of OMG.

They may go off twice before the fork. I didn't think it would do what it did until tomorrow. I'm buying some alts now, and I expect 5800ish BTC in next 24-36 hrs.  That's the bet I placed, not too greedy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:05:34
I hope to be a bitcoin millionaire on the days I'm not an altcoin millionaire, and vice versa. Lol!
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:12:38
Sell alts when they are all red? Are yall crazy? Buy alts now, sell when BTC corrects after $6800. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:57:44
What kind of ban are we talking here? They may tell people to stop, but if heard c oinbase alone was reporting 40000 new accounts a week. Mathmatically they will never be able to hire enough people to shut this shit down. All they can hope to do is collect a sales tax from all the cool shit were about to buy. But they can fight it if they want, ill still buy cool shit.

I think the low prices alts should be taken advantage of more than high prices Bitcoin. I don't know if that makes sense to anyone but me, but that's how I look at my purchases. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:28:23
As for the fork, my guess is as good as anybodies, and I have no clue. I'm 75% BTC and 25% alts in USD. Dunno what that really means yet though. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:41:32
I don't think the alts can go much lower. I'm buying as we speak. I've been placing orders since yesterday evening. And ill sell when BTC takes a dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:18:23
And I got some VERI while it's on sale. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:48:09
I want one of those badass Cap'n Crunch hats the backup dancers are wearing!
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:49:56
It's just how I roll. Its simple, any newb can get one and be safe. I'm sure with proper measures web wallets are safe too, but I just don't trust them as much. You get what you paid for, and web wallets are free!
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:35:08
Thanks, it's my day job!

That lady spent a lot of time and effort being wrong. When she mentions the best parts of Bitcoin she says "that will never happen, so lets stop thinking that"  . If you believe you will be a slave to the banks and governments forever, you are right. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:39:40
Get the Trezor. None of your BTC is safe until then. You wouldn't cash your paycheck to set it in your yard, would you?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:22:08
5-6 pm. Everybody has to stop trading at work so they can drive home to trade more. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:56:34
I had my BTC on a Trezor, and got my BCH onto hitBTC in time to get $700 a piece for them. Something you couldn't do waiting for someone else to decide how to handle your money. If you're serious, get a hardware wallet. I bought a wallet before I bought any crypto. Just something someone smarter than me recommended. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:33:57
Any hardware wallet. Its a secured way to simply and safely store your private keys as soon as you get into crypto. I like Trezor, but that's all I've used. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:37:19
Trezor is what I use. They fixed the bug. Way safer than any non-hardware wallet will ever imagine being. Youtube is the best resource, but can't replace practice. It's a minimal investment if you're serious. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:10:07
You gonna wait for it to hit $10,000? Buy some BITCOIN!
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:17:46
You write them down and keep it safe. All I know is none of the people begging for help on ether scan used hard wallets. You can do whatever you want with your money. Since I plan on retiring on mine, I spent $100 on a wallet. You get what you pay for, and web wallets are free. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:04:05
If you held on Trezor you could be got your BCH on hitBTC in time to get $700 a piece for them instead of waiting for someone else to figure out how they're going to handle your money. I recommend getting a wallet before any cryptos, if you're serious about not being a sad story in the message boards on etherscan. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:31:25
Basically it's where you have to get started unless you know someone who will change out fiat or anything else on a p2p level. It's high fees, and you don't control your private keys, but its insured and very customer friendly. Its a minimal fee for convenience in the beginning. I always recommend getting a hardware wallet before bitcoin told you're serious about this. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:36:44
Well, all the things you mentioned get hacked, a lot. Think of Trezor like your bank, and everything else is as secure as your pocket. Keep what you want to use there, but no more than you are willing to lose. The convenience of other methods DOES COME AT THE COST OF SECURITY. Do what you want, but I don't want my computer to ever know what keystrokes unlock my private keys to my big stash. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:25:18
You can find an individual with enough bitcoin he doesn't mind selling for what you have to offer, or you can spend about 3 months cultivating a reputation on coinbase. There may be a few other options. But its a secret. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:19:29
Just saw that. Lol! But if you have not yet, see my previous post. Everybody needs 1 before the dollar totally implodes. 
Edit: the problem with that statement is, not everybody can have 1 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:18:51
Just buy as many as you can now. Mining will never catch up with compound interest. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:44:22
It's sterling silver and 14k gold. Chain and pendant set 1 BTC. Check out Bad Bronc on facebook and Instagram. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:10:31
Or you can wait for it to double, you know, if you're still not sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:31:25
It will take better care of you than money in the bank. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:39:41
Even if its online storage, someone watching your desktop can potentially see what you are typing, not a chance I'm willing to take with my retirement. If someone steals your Trezor, and you secured everything properly, you are safe. If someone steals your phone, and is sufficiently motivated, YOU ARE SCREWED. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:36:07
If you do enough research, you will see the only money that will get wasted is what you don't put in Cryptos. If you just do BTC and ETH now and hold a year or so, I promise it will outperform anything on EARTH!
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:03:05
The longer they keep it down, the more paychecks we can stuff into it. They're doing us a very frustrating favor. Lol!
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:08:25
No PICS, never digitally store your info. Pen and paper only. Or I guess an analog photo if you really trust the Walgreens picture guy. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:49:06
Thank you! Everything is negotiable. Lol!
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:53:19
And someone has to be willing to sell. I won't sell do any fiat, good or bad. Peer to peer is great, if we don't want their fake money like they did in the 30s, crypto are the only way out. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:56:37
Not until the real BTC that he's spending to do all this stops going up. Lol! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:52:22
P. S. smash your phone in a fit of rage, or lose it, and let me know how sorting all that out on an android with all those 2fA and shit. It will be a nightmare waiting for support emails. Trust me. They are great as long as nothing goes wrong.
