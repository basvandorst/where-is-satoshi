Where's the btc boc

They moan about volatility as usual but failed to research BitShares market pegged assets. I can't take these people seriously, they are so outside the loop, they can't keep up with all the innovations going on. Soon you will have a bitcoin wallet with integrated bitAssets such as bitUSD, bitGOLD and more allowing you to hedge instantly and whenever you feel the need. Its a game changer folks, and one that will finally put the volatility critics to bed.

Mmmm Mac D, they accept bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:03:25
What they've basically done is rob their own customers of over 7000 BTC. Then they put up a bounty to see if people could catch them, they couldn't. Now they feel safe and will use some of that 7000+ BTC to pay to have their site upgraded. Then they will resume trading for several months and sell the site or maybe just continue ownership and rob everyone again next year, probably both if they leave a weakness in the security on purpose again.

Fuck Coinbase! I don't give a fuck how much they have raised the profile of Bitcoin, they are ultimately hurting its core principals in the long run. Fuck the banks, fuck the regulations. Close down and fuck off.

I'm very bullish on bitshares and bitassets! A decentralized exchange is what satoshi wanted and I'm sure he's smiling now...
