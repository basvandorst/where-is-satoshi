Christ, really guys? I'm a loooooong time lurker and this is starting to get real grim. Are we being real with ourselves here? That Bull run was pathetic. I stopped following when the market started to go up and just went into "put my head in the sand mode" for a bit. I come back to check thinking the market will be in full swing just to see we are back at 7k?

Here’s a question to the Bitcoin accumulater crowd. Wouldn’t selling your bitcoin now be the best way to end up with a greater quantity of bitcoin? If you sell for 100 and the price drops to 90 then you can buy 90 dollars worth plus and extra 10 dollars worth. 
What would be the benefit to buying right now when the market is looking so poor?

Trading volume and consumer interest just isn't there man. It's not taking off in 2018 like people hyped it at the end of 2017. Recent news is good but nothing major.

Buying while the price is crashing is risky as well, no? Much more risky in the currrnt environment I’d say. An accumulation strategy in general is risky. Better to buy a little bit after the price starts to bottom out than to buy while it is still crashing.

I've seen you around here since the start of the year. If you don't mind me asking how do you feel about what has happened. You have been very adamant about the price going up.

Because you could instead wait until it falls even lower to buy. You risk losing thousands now when you could instead wait and buy even *more* bitcoin in a safer market.

And how much value has bitcoin lost since last December? How in the world could that be your logic against altcoins?

Why is it surprising that the people who were correct (the anti-HODL group) got downvoted to hell? Because it means that this place is not a place for discussion or a place of intellectuals willing to objectively discuss the market. It is people just spreading FOMO online about missing out on 100k coins and creating a sad echo chamber. I expect reddit to be above facebook comment sections. 


And this market is a correction back to where the price used to be for bitcoin. Like you said, it has really changed so why would the price change?

I just want this to be put out there into the ether. I have been checking and following bitcoin since at least 2014. I have been lurking and browsing here since at least the start of this year. I can say definitively that anyone saying that bitcoin is going to drop to 4k (which for some reason was always the marker) or that bitcoin is overvalued got downvoted to hell and back.

The manipulation was the 100000000% increase in a matter of days last year lol.  There have been articles written about it and experts have essentially taken that as fact for a while now. The price was literally manipulated up and based on speculation/FOMO (GET BITCOIN BEFORE IT GOES TO A TRILLION DONT MISS OUT). This is just a natural correction down to where bitcoin has been for years. I.e. this is the normal price not the manipulation.

This argument is going to be used to destroy people advocating for bitcoin in just a few months. How's bitcoin going to look "compared to 12 months ago" in December? Or are we going to switch to "compared to 12 months, 19 days, and 4 hours ago" as the new barometer?
