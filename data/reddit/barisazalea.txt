I am explaining that how i'm sorry for people arguing over coins instead of spreading the knowledge of blockchain. And do you really think that i am pumping anything? I hope you can understand me someday.
This is my only other post in any blockchain related subreddit except some newbie questions.

This is exactly what i was trying to say, thank you. I know i can't just vanish billions dollars worth industry. But i am sure there are people still believe blockchain is much more than this.

I am not into politics since i am already living in hell lol.But governments can have other countries as a slave with their money, thats why i dont think there is going to be a war too.They are already fighting with money

Thank you so much.I can say that rates are okay but not sure about fee's and how much they usually are.Since we dont have paypal i dont have much choice to buy.From where i buy fee is %8,9
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:34:31
I am living in İstanbul and my place of residence(ikametgah) is in Bursa so i didnt try to take it but didn't know fee is that low. Fuck.
Edit:buying with debit card maybe thats why fee is high
