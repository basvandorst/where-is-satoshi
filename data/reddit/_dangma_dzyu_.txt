Wrong again. The Federal Reserve answers to **NO ONE**. 
Hence, why they've never been audited. 
Please research moar, so you don't confuse others.
The government has zero control over the FED. I know that doesn't sound right to you, so you'll reject that fact out of hand, but that's the fact and if you researched it, you'd know. Since you obviously don't, there's no reason to continue argueing with what you *believe* is true. Look up the actual facts.

Ah. That makes so much sense. But even if us poor common folk ever did figure out the secret recipe, we'd never actually make a road because that's the government's job, and without them it would just never get done. We'd all be stuck on dirt roads.

Fiat doesn't depend on who issues it. (Although if you don't think the government is behind BTC, then you haven't been around long enough).
Back in 2006, it was publicly predicted that TPTB would issue a new global currency in 2008/2009. See "The Hidden Hand Dialogue" for more infor on that.
But regardless, "fiat" just means not backed by anything. 
And for the record, by your own definition, USD isn't fiat, because the US Government doesn't issue USD. That's done by a private company. That company is called The Federal Reserve, and it is no more "Federal" than "Federal Express". 
So either way, your theory got BTFO.

FIAT = Not backed in anything of value.
BTC = Not backed in anything at all.
BTC = FIAT.
Greenbacks, Dinars, Shekels, etc = Non-Fiat, because you can/could exchange them for precious metals, which have actual value.

Straight out of the Hasbara/JIDF handbook (handed out to jewish college student to make extra money while in school), call anyone who points out "Israel"s atrocities as "Anti-Semites" and/or "Nazi"s. 
Ad Hominem 101
And FYI, there are no Semites in Israel, you tard. The Semites are in Palestine, and they are Arabic. 
Modern Jews (Khazar converts) are not semitic. 
Also, pointing out that the land is illegally occupied by jews has nothing to do with being anti-anything. Only pointing out the facts.

You're right. I'm guilty of overlooking the **other** side of genocide and apartheid. I'm just not seeing it in the bright light that you see it in, I guess.
I confess. I can only conceive of genocide as something *bad*.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:06:58


Sad if true. Although, I don't believe you. No one can be this retardedly brainwashed.




Nope. Sorry. Understanding that land was **stolen** from Palestinians, and now there is a genocide being committed against the arabs. . . doesn't make you an anti-semite. How retarded are you?




Nope. Sorry. The word is self-explanatory. **Anti** = Against, **Semite** = Semitic People. Jews are not Semitic People. Nice try though. Sorry you don't have rudimentary reading comprehension skills.
Obvious bullshit propaganda is obvious, and hitting on all the JIDF talking points.




"The Jewish People" who weren't Khazar converts, were killed in WWII. The Ashkenazis set up the Balfour Declaration before WWII. They used WWII as an excuse to steal the Palestinian land. Using insane propaganda (6 Million, Lamp shades made of skin, and soap made from jewish fat. . . all proven lies).

Bitcoin is Fiat. . . 
It is not backed in anything of actual value (gold, silver, etc). It's value is based on Supply and Demand. That's Fiat.
The difference between BTC and USD and most other currency, is that BTC is not used for Fractional Reserve Banking. 
Fiat + Fractional Reserve is where the real problems come from. 
BTC = Fiat  
USD = Fiat  
Greenbacks = Non-Fiat. (RIP Abe)  
Shekel = Non-Fiat  
Dinar = Non-Fiat

Bitcoin is Fiat. I'm sorry that you don't understand what fiat means. Fiat means it's not backed by anything of value (like precious metals). Fiat means that the value is determined by supply and demand. Bitcoin is fiat.
I'm sorry that this is news to you.
And no one said anything about BTC replacing USD. But it absolutely will.

Well, being based on Crypto, and a limited supply, it's not exactly the same as printing it out of thin air whenever you run out. But it's def not backed in Gold/Silver/Wheat/Etc, so it's def fiat.
Just wait until Coinbase starts Fractional Reserve Lending.

I would buy $1,000,000 worth of raw LSD crystal (xtal), which should get you almost a quarter kilo of raw LSD. That's 2.5M doses of LSD. I'd sell each dose for $10, cash on the streets.
Not only have you cashed out your BTC, but you've turned $1M into $25M. Now, let's say it takes you $4 million to launder that cash properly. You've still gained $20M profit after laundering fees.
