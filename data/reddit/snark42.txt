You can get flagged for smurfing if you try to play that game...

As long as you don't want to withdraw cash (ie will accept bank/cashiers check) and have the funds to cover the deposit by at least 2x this is a non-issue.  If you deposit a cashiers check from a big bank you can probably get them to call to verify the check is legitimate and have access to the funds right away.
If you want to get cash they generally need a few days notice to get that much cash together or some nonsense.

Indiana has it in the constitution that the jury can determine the LAW and the facts.  It's pretty rare for nullification to be allowed/recognized though.

Not really.  You pay property tax eventually, to the state.  Some states have an excise or transfer tax.  You pay income taxes when you sell the property to the IRS and State .  The IRS doesn't have a real interest in your cash purchase other than you may deduct property taxes paid.

Why?  Assuming seller would accept CAD (or BTC)

This not true for a cash transaction...
That said I get your point, you'd pay on the currency conversion as "income" a the time of the transaction regardless of value (bought a $500,000 house with currency you paid $250,000 for.)

You forgot about the hedge against USD inflation this offers as well.

Long term capital gains rate on AGI less than 37,950 for single filer (more for married filing jointly) is 0% in the US for federal tax purposes.  Some states treat it differently so you may owe state income tax.
Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income.

They're also doubling the standard deduction so you could have another $6450 on top of whatever the bracket max is.  However, they are getting rid of the personal exemption I believe, so it might only be an extra $2400 on top of the 0% bracket.

Legally employees are entitled to a lot more than independent contractors (minimum wage, benefits, mandatory breaks, company pays employment tax on them, etc.) so it's not being technical.
That said I think most people are happy being contractors for Uber (part-time or what not) and the media attention/lawsuit is silly as they knew what the deal was when they started driving.

ObamaCare requires that companies pay a fine if they don't provide benefits, so that's federal but not technically required.
Apparently paid breaks (usually 10-15 minutes per 4 hours work, plus some sort of unpaid lunch) are state laws.

Independent contractors.  They get their contracts started and canceled.

He wasn't charged with the murder for hire which likely was entrapment.
