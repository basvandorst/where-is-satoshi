I'm graduating with my major in CS next fall and I don't know about that. BTC can definitely be stopped (see: banks and credit unions banning BTC transactions) and/or effectively legislated away. Other cryptos which have advantages over Bitcoin may take over. People could lose faith in the whole crypto scene due to it being the real "wild west" of investing; there are as many scams as there are coins. Lots can go wrong. I think the technology is cool and some of it will survive 20 or more years, but we don't know what will survive. None of it is proprietary to bitcoin.
I'm actually almost worried that so many of my senior undergrad friends know so much about Bitcoin when 6 months ago they knew nothing. It's like Joe Kennedy said in 1929 just before the Great Depression: when shoeshine boys are telling you about the day's financial news, it's time to sell.

Is there any non-illegal reason a currency like Monero would be accepted by the mainstream masses?
I'm all about privacy, I'm specializing in cybersecurity and understand its importance. But just as my mom isn't using a VPN, I don't see why my mom would convert her fiat to Monero. Privacy so often is only a concern to people who have something to hide, and I don't see why that would change.

@_date: 2018-01-27 01:56:02
This is actually a good comment which might not be appreciated here.
BTC right now is a speculative asset, nothing more. It has no function as a currency and may never. LN and segwit gives us a chance to say "well maybe someday" but that someday isn't today. It will crash lower than it is now, it has no other option. That doesn't mean today's a bad day to invest, it just makes it a much higher risk than most investments.
Not to mention (from my own observations) the community largely has no idea how any of this works and are buying in because they want a 10x ROI. Novice investors + bad investment practices + general confusion = something bad.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:41:56

I've never claimed any absolutes here. What you define as a peak is always relative to your investment goals. 
If you miss a wave, miss a wave! Miss 10, 50, 100 waves. The majority of us here have missed the majority of the waves. You don't measure your investment success based on what didn't happen. But if you keep buying in at ATH thinking "oh gee this is it, it's taking off and I'll miss my chance," say goodbye to your money. The people who did this at $8k got lucky, the people who did this at $19k didn't.

Why immediately jump to Zimbabwe dollars, the worst currency on the planet? Is that Bitcoin's benchmark? 
I can convert my USD to CAD and rest easy knowing that my gains or losses will be minimal in both the short and long term. Or I can convert my USD to BTC and constantly worry whether the value will drop by 25% over the weekend. Not a good store of value at all.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:46:06
The key difference is in the volatility. If a company lost 20% of its stock overnight, it would be chaos. That's a year or several years worth of slow sustained growth gone down the drain.
For Bitcoin, 20% swings overnight in either direction aren't that uncommon, so it's tough to call them crashes and recoveries. Everyone invested knows that this is a volatile market, a "live by the sword, die by the sword" type of investment. 
So you have to look towards its (relatively) long term growth: it's down close to 50% on the month and there's no real ETA on when buyers who got in at 15k will get their money back. We're still waiting on the recovery from the 19.2k pop, that was supposed to have happened by now.
Bitcoin's growth as a speculative asset puts it firm into bubble territory. You don't think this type of 1200% growth per year is sustainable forever, do you?

I disagree. At 19, you should be focusing on moving out, affording college, buying a car, renting apartments, and getting your life started. And odds are you're being paid less than $20/hr. It's one of the most financially unstable times in your life. $5000 for me at 19 was like 5 months of work.

Come on, I know you probably support "the blockchain technology" but Bitcoin is no longer a useful currency, and its functionality as a shit currency is certainly not where it derives its value from. It may be currency on paper, but in exchanges, it is a speculative asset.


Please do not fall for this age-old "new paradigm" trap. You will end up losing money and convincing others to lose their money. Bitcoin is nothing special, at all, period. I say this as an owner.


If BTC's mainstream use case is not realized within the next year or two, I can certainly give you a good prediction what will happen with it. BTC is under the spotlight today, it can't keep being that internet money with massive fees and slow processing times used to buy drugs online.

You'd probably have to do more work. It's tough to find data since most places didn't have a minimum wage, but here's a random excerpt from a [document]( about laborers in the boot and shoe industry in 1914:

Because it reeks of horrible financial planning and discipline. If you have the money to invest, you should invest it when you're confident, which would be at one time. If you don't have the money to invest and you're investing each paycheck, you shouldn't be investing.

Bottom line in all of this is you should never buy at ATH, period. It's pure FOMO. Some idiots will get lucky, most others won't. 
If you "believe in the technology" and are making a long-term investment, you can wait a few days or weeks to buy in at a lower price.

A hodler is someone who holds Bitcoin. Everything else you just made up.
The vast majority of people are in BTC to make money, this sub's hyper-fixation on price over application is evidence enough. The "hodl" meme is just a lazy way of trying to convince others to never sell so the price goes up. When you view BTC as an actual *currency* and not a *speculative asset*, holding eternally makes no sense.

That analogy doesn't make sense: Ethernet and Dial-up had no major competitors, Bitcoin competes with every single coin on the market. Its share of the crypto market cap shrinks every month.
What you've called Bitcoinization should be called "Cryptoization". Crypto will survive, crypto will get stronger, crypto will offer solutions to today's problems. Bitcoin may not be the one to do it. 
A good real-world analogy of what I'm talking about: Betamax vs. VHS. Betamax came first, Betamax ran into problems it couldn't answer, Betamax went to zero, VHS took over. Home video recording survived and got stronger, Betamax got squashed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:55:49
When did I say otherwise?
I'm saying when *you're* making decisions on how to invest, *you* should invest smart and not worry about missing any waves.
Take literally all of 15 seconds to look at the history of the coin and you find it has plenty of plateaus and plenty of dips. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:30:49
This isn't about confidence, it's about your ability to afford what you're buying into. Repeatedly buying into the same investment is usually a sign of an investor who is spending too much money on his investment. 
Easy example: You start off buying $1000 worth of Bitcoin. The price dips two weeks later, so you buy another $500. The price again dips in another few weeks, so you buy another $500. So you originally planned on only spending $1000, but now you've ended up spending $2000 because your emotions got the best of you. This is bad investing, you can't slice it any other way. If you were confident and could afford to spend $2000, you should have spent $2000 at the start. If you couldn't afford $2000 at the start, you're now deviating from your investment goals and you're spending too much money.

@_date: 2018-01-27 00:23:01
What does "Buy the dip" really mean? I'm not talking about the definition, but rather the application. 
If you're a disciplined investor, you should be going in risking x% of your assets and no more, and you should have a buy-in strategy, a specific financial goal, and an exit strategy. Where does "buy more whenever it dips" fit into that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:53:12
Of course minimum wage has evolved a lot (so has the dairy business), but to put it into perspective, minimum wage in 1913 could get you half a gallon of milk per hour. Now it gets you 3-4 gallons. That's the point I was trying to make.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:55:08
But the way it's usually phrased, this isn't a one-time buy-in. Some people are buying in multiple times. IF you truly believe in the technology and that the price will rise, when would this ever be a good strategy?
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:46:17
Like I said, everyone who gambles believes they will win, but this is a zero-sum game. A lot of people will be losers and nobody thinks it will be them. I hope at least you've done your math so that if Bitcoin tanks, you won't have to re-enter the workforce.

We have to start accepting sooner or later that the blockchain argument is falling apart, the blockchain is not proprietary to Bitcoin. Nothing is anymore. It seems like every other crypto out there has solved something which Bitcoin is struggling with.


How do we scale Bitcoin up to the level of Visa if it consumes as much power as it does performing a single transaction and is restricted to a decentralized network? Don't get me wrong, decentralization is cool for a number of reasons, but not if you're trying to make Bitcoin better and faster than the alternatives.

There are also a lot of morons here who think they're financial experts now that they've gambled and won. And their greed prevents them from ever investing with discipline. They have lambos in their eyes. Some chunk of them will lose everything and realize that what they had was always enough, then throw themselves off of a building.

I agree, I bought into BTC at a pretty low and safe amount last week, but this community makes me second guess everything.
This community is a case example as to why BTC is a terrible cryptocurrency. Almost everyone here is buying into it, waiting for it to appreciate, and then exchanging it for dollars. That's not anything like how you would treat a stable currency. That's how you treat baseball cards. Imagine buying into pesos or rupees that way. 
This community makes no fucking sense, either. They want BTC to develop as a normal currency, but they also celebrate the massive price rises. So which one is it? Any currency which rises 19.6% in a week isn't a stable currency, and any investment that stays mostly flat isn't a good one. Clearly 9/10ths of the people here give no shit about cryptocurrencies and just invested with dreams of getting rich quick.

We're still years from mass adoption, we have big technological hurdles to overcome, we have loads of competition from other coins who have already cleared those hurdles, and we still have no clear mass adoption use case in reach. And worst of all, the clock is ticking. Bitcoin is already under the spotlight and it can't be plagued with these problems for years if it's going to succeed in the long term.
Every new technology under the sun could be compared to the automobile. Vast majority of those technologies mean nothing in the long term.

We both know that's not why most people are buying. 
Otherwise, people in this subreddit would be impartial if it hit $30000 in December or $0 instead. That's so obviously not the case though. All anyone cares about is the price and anything that sounds bullish. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:41:31
The thing nobody here wants to tell you is that you shouldn't use the Bitcoin subreddit to ask whether or not to invest in Bitcoin. Of course they're going to say yes -- they've already invested a lot of money into it. They need people like you to buy in for the currency to succeed.
The reality here is Bitcoin could be the next Beanie Baby. It's worth nothing unless other people are trading. It's treated by most people as more of a stock than a currency, which is what keeps me from buying more into it.

This is exactly the bad bumper sticker logic that makes people go broke.

Bitcoin went very mainstream last year. Is appearing every day on CNBC and being the discussion of Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner not enough? 
 Also be careful what you wish for. More mainstream adoption without nuanced understanding of the technology or the risks of investment will kill the currency like you've never seen before. Bitcoin bubbles are fueled by a big influx of new buyers, and if people get bit and lose thousands, they will not be returning.
Ask yourself whether your vision for Bitcoin is that of a healthy cryptocurrency or that of an apparent get rich quick scheme. You can't have it both ways.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:42:42
Yeah awareness peaked in Nov-Dec when it was on CNBC each day and every family was talking about it at the Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner table.

What's there to cite? Bitcoin on paper is a better utility now than it was last November and December. LN is going to fix everything, or so they say. We already got the mainstream acknowledgment we wanted. Yet current prices are a disappointment compared to the projections going into the new year.
If this is a solid technology and not a get rich quick craze, where has all the energy gone and why aren't we seeing actual widespread implementation? This is the core of the bearish outlook.

The problem with BTC is that it's labelled a currency but traded as a stock. That's why few places accept it. What would you rather I give you, $135 in cash or one stock in John Deere?
If it doesn't stabilize then it will never be a real currency, and if it doesn't become a real currency then it'll become as valuable as Beanie Babies. That's the long and short of it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:39:06
I'll deny it for him, I'm as far from as it gets.
This sub is crazy, the delusion here for Bitcoin is off the chart. The article isn't accurate, she wasn't even offered Bitcoins. And the idea of "if they held onto bitcoin then they'd be a millionaire" ignores how markets work. This sub is in a frenzy over someone criticizing the currency which has already crashed before in the past few years.
Let's face it. You guys need new FOMO investors to make money. That's what this is all about. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:00:00
Don't look past the obvious. What do people do more?
1. Buy Bitcoin to use it in exchange for goods and services.
2. Buy Bitcoin to sell someday and make money.
Which I agree, is not exactly a stock, but is definitely not within the spirit of a currency. If nobody is purchasing anything with Bitcoin, then it will fail again.

You just supported his argument.
Whether BTC is in a bull or bear market, its month-to-month fluctuations move with extreme volatility. I can invest in Yen tomorrow and in 5 years my portfolio will not have moved as much as BTC does in a single day. That is why BTC is a horrible currency.

Let's be serious for a second. Bitcoin dropped from 19.2k to 7.4k in just a few weeks after virtually nothing changed. BTC is arguably in a better position utility-wise and adoption-wise now than it was in December.
What's holding BTC up from, say, sub-1k? Why should the price even go up?

You're right, it's a completely new paradigm which puts everything you know about finance and economics to bed. Those laws just don't apply anymore.
It's real simple. You know how charts keep going up and to the right? They're just going to do that forever and ever until we all are filthy rich. It's mathematically impossible for it to crash -- McAfee told me so. Best of all, this is only the beginning. Remember how small the internet was in the year 1690? That's how small Bitcoin is today.

The old "house money" fallacy.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:49:25
Bitcoin right now is half the value it was 3 months ago, and virtually nothing has changed since then. On paper, Bitcoin should be stronger now with more segwit nodes and the slow adoption of LN.  To pretend like we know enough about what's going to happen over the next couple years is ridiculous. 
And to bet student loans on it is extra dumb. Your principal affects your interest payment, and when you finally graduate college and have a job, that interest could be the difference between crawling out of debt and staying in it forever.

Lots of great techs didn't make it past that initial hurdle, though. I'm not saying Bitcoin won't, I'm saying it hasn't yet. 
Cryptocurrency may have a promising future where all these kinks are worked out, but Bitcoin may not be in that future. Home video recording is in our society today, Betamax isn't. Airline travel is in our society today, Concorde isn't. We just don't know yet what the future holds. I'm mostly only saying this because OP's "the internet survived, so that means so will Bitcoin" argument is going to end up making a lot of people lose a lot of money.

3rd graph is also insanely incorrect. First off, comparing your technology to proven technologies of the past is a brainless endeavor, you can insert anything popular in place of Bitcoin and it works. Second, IF you're going to compare anything to past technologies, it should be **cryptocurrency as a whole**, *not* one particular coin. 
Every single line on that graph represents a technology battle between two or more major competing technologies.
* Electricity: The famous AC vs. DC. 
* Internet: Pets.com, Kozmo.com, eToys.com... massive corporations died in the dotcom crash.
* Auto: Oldsmobile, DeLorean, Pontiac, all gone.
* Computers: Man alive, where do we begin? Compaq, Wang Labs, Tandy, to name a couple that are no longer with us.
Here's another little story. In the late 1970s, the race was on to bring video recording devices to the consumer level. The technology began with Betamax. Betamax owned 100% of the market share, but it couldn't provide consumers with what they wanted most: the ability to record a film on one tape. Years later came a technology you may have heard of: VHS. VHS gobbled up Betamax's entire market share. VHS survived for many years, the home video recording device market still exists today, but Betamax died.
Anyone who puts a single cent into Bitcoin due to horrible graphs deserves to lose any money they may lose.

@_date: 2018-02-12 05:33:49
Nobody knows. Right now, some of the drawbacks involve its ridiculously high carbon footprint, the fees and confirmation times which will get worse as new people join, and the wild west state of crypto regulations (ex: Bitconnect). I think also it won't be widely adopted for its actual purpose (as a currency) until the prices stabilize to the point of where investing becomes unexciting. Nobody wants to barter with something volatile -- there will always be a loser in every fair transaction.
All that aside, I think the  roadblock right now is all the technical jargon. The plumbers and hairdressers of the world do not understand forks, mempools, hash rates, signatures, or even fiat. Do they need to know all that? I don't know, but they're not buying into it right now.

Dude you've fucked up in a major way. It was your shitty decision making and delusional "it's still okay!" thinking which got you into this hole. If you keep going, you and your sister will be flat out broke and on food stamps. Stop all this fucking nonsense, seek professional help **immediately**, and if all goes well you will learn from your stupidity and will never gamble your money ever again. If you're *really* lucky, your sister will talk to you decades from now. If I was her, I wouldn't.
I mean holy shit dude.
Edit: By the way, you owe your sister $35,000. You know that $410,000 you lost? $375,000 of that was yours, and $375,000 was hers. Your spent all of yours and some of hers. I don't give a fuck if your dad gave it to you. If your dad gave you a pie and said "split it with your sister" and you threw 55% of it into the trash can, you don't split the remaining 45% with your sister. You give your sister the remaining 45% plus an extra 5% from somewhere else and you don't get to fucking eat because you threw yours in the trash can.
