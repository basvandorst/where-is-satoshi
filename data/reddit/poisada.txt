thanks. I am amazed how hundreds of people make 30 minute videos explaining bitcion and cryptocurrency, but never tells you straight up how to just get started, what your very first steps as a newbie should be. I always suspected this whole thing was easier than it seemed after watching multiple videos and reading many articles/ texts on the matter.

I'm just incredibly confused over this whole thing with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and all that. Yes, yes, blockchain, decentralized, bitcoin mining etc. But how do i get started with this stuff? I have not come across any straight-to-point real guide on how to start. I think that way is really the only way for me to understand/ learn what all this is about -just getting started.
Is there an app i download? Do i make an account or something along those lines somewhere? I search and people mention like 100 different things. It is all quite confusing. As far as i understand, you need a wallet which displays the amount of cryptocurrency you have, and then what? Is that all you need? And is bitcoin bought and sold as any commodity? You just find some site that sells or buys bitcoin, and then with your wallet get started? I'm just overall really confused over this whole thing.
I have read a bunch of texts on crypotcurreny and bitcoin, watched multple videos explaining it, and i still just dont quite get how to get started. Where do i start?
EDIT: Okay, i went into the android app store and downloaded Coinbase. When i open the app it shows the fluctuation of bitcoin over time, and there is a button that says SIGN UP. So i suppose i sign up? Then what?
