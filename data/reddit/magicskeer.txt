So the link to a resource file is decentralized... But the resource file is still centralized?
What is the point?

You mean:
2^256 / 2^160 = 2^256-160 = 2^96

My interpretation of [source](
1. There is 1 public key per private key
2. The public keys goes through a series of hashing 
  *  The result can be considered random due to [avalanche effect](
3. The *almost* final result is a concatination of a hash and a substring of a hash (and therefore considered random)
4. Take base58check encoding (doesn't change anything)
Therefore, since the address is considered random, there is a bit of justification that the distribution is near uniform.

If I understand this correctly, I essentially send my bitcoins (separately) to joinmarket, and eventually withdraw them such that they are shuffled and anonymous?

I want to point out 2 things.
1. You are putting your trust into your bank, thinking that it will acknowledge your money, and that it will reverse the transaction.
2. If you flip the scenario around, then wouldn't a recipient of funds want to ensure that those funds cannot be reversed?
As for reversing transactions, there are bitcoins escrow services that you can utilise to achieve the result you want.

[Pigeonhole principle](
Basically you have *n* items, and you put them in *m* containers (in whatever way you like). If *n* &gt; *m*, then there must be at least 1 container with 2 or more items. (There must be 1 ~~private key~~ address with 2 or more ~~addresses~~ private keys.)
But in this case, simply 2^256 ~~addresses~~ private keys, but only 2^160 ~~private keys~~ addresses, then splitting them evenly will result in an average of 2^96 ~~addresses~~ private keys per ~~private key~~ address.
