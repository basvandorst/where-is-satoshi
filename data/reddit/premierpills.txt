got my bch , sent to a easier looking wallet bch-wallet.com
was gunna send it to shapeshift. it never showed up after days.
messaged support multiple times, sent 1.6063 bch. how ever in ticket i mentioned i only sent 1.6.
me thinking i got fucked over got a message saying it was recieved, then my balance showed 1.6 bch. (sent 1.6063) idk fees but maybe they are just hoping im using this as a storage wallet so thought i'd send more??
but then i tried to send the bch to a different wallet, and its been over a month with no response from support.

It never showed in the wallet after a week or two
I messaged bch support check site they have a option .
I said I deposited the bch and sent the txt ID. 
Magically support responsed 4 Days later and said ur acc has been credited .
So now I finally could send my bch to shapeshift to concert and sent to my btc wallet.
I sent it, it said confirmed.
Now my wallet balance is 0.
Shapeshift never got anything , I messaged support and told them that several times with no response , BCHsupport
It’s like they never sent it
