-how our money system is flawed 
-they won't understand y we need new money if they think ur money works now
-benifits over fiat
-how fiat is running stuff
-how cool it is to gabble with tinny amounts of money 
-how you could hook it up to video games
-the email of money?
-how inconvenient banking is right now
-how its a irreversible thing, try to get them to snap and have that mind change, like explain how money could be joyous, not a pain, and always feels like its evaporating, how we could have the reverse of inflation
idk just spitballing :)
