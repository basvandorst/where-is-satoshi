One theory is that the huge run-up we've had is big money buying in so that they can sell and realize a short position on btc before buying back in at the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:37:38
Yeah no. Bitcoin is trackable like mad.

No kidding, you can't even buy two single family homes in my part of town for a million dollars :( when it comes to commercial real estate, a million dollars is a tiny amount of money to start a business with.

The alts haven't moved much with this latest run-up though so I think they may be somewhat decoupled now. Your point about diversifying is still a good one though.

If anyone has a connection to elon we could put this on the test of the falcon heavy in Mars orbit. He would love the idea of incentivising future space flight. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:06:52
There's zero reason to do this and every reason not to.

Get elon musk on board, he's launching a Tesla roadster into Mars orbit to test the new rocket. Yours would be a perfect thing to include on that launch.

It can't be denied that btc does take some very domain specific knowledge to secure well though.  Keeping your cash reasonably safe is relatively intuitive comparatively. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:00:01
Outlawing it would hurt it, but couldn't kill it. That's the whole point of decentralization

On the other hand, it's possible btc is MySpace in this analogy. I believe in cryptocurrency but I think there are enough places to innovate in the space that it's very possible btc itself may not be the final form.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:33:34
I personally don't see this as the way forward, gold has real world utility outside of a store of value. If btc has no utility other than a store of value then it's very susceptible to the fads and whims of the population and there's nothing really backing it beyond sentiment. That's why I really hope we don't let go of the idea that btc is a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:56:51
Functionally, for many people they have. I'm very pro cash and anti CC in principle but even I barely walk around with cash in my wallet and I use it in maybe 1% of my transactions. Cash is king but convenience is the Queen.

They didn't push segwit2x, they did exactly what they should do and tried to allow the users to do what they want with segwitx2. Exchanges are centralization, we don't want them out there throwing weight behind this fork or that fork over another, they should remain as neutral as possible and allow the market to decide.

Because over the long term things need some utility in order to maintain stable value, otherwise it's just a collectable, like stamps or antiques.

If it goes too far in the direction of a store of value but has little utility as a currency, then demand could fall until we hit obscurity eventually.

The only thing that will be worth anything in an emp scenario will be goods. Food, beer, seeds, medicine. Gold might help high rollers who are connected to the world market but I think that's about it. Dollars won't be worth much.

What makes a hardware wallet better than say, a paper one?
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:49:19
Five years online is like 20 in the real world. I think your not far off. Biggest downside I see to bitcoin is it's not user friendly to mom and pop. But then I stop and think about the fact that every day that  goes by, the number of people who were born with an iPhone in their hand goes up. Eventually the world will be entirely filled with people who grew up with the internet, and are tech savvy, and from what I've seen of gen Z, they aren't gonna trust banks and governments all that much. That's why I'm bullish long term.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:02:28
How do the off chain transactions ensure no funny business or cheating?

@_date: 2017-10-03 18:57:22
I think banks may be replaced, HOWEVER, there will still be entities sitting between most people and their bitcoin for the plain and simple reason that bitcoin is much less simple to use securely for the average everyday person. It's not TERRIBLY difficult to do it right, but it's harder than keeping your money in the bank and praying the FDIC insurance covers you in the event the bank fails. We need to be realistic about this fact and find decentralized solutions to it if btc will ever reach mass adoption without centralized exchanges and companies sitting in between the population and their coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:53:38
I don't see much patience for that, end of the day, forks present some risk to HODLers and are a pain for miners and just a lot of bother and worry for many entities. I can see maybe a few more forks max before there's some real resistance to them just overall. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:58:43
If an attack like that happens it seems like it would originate from outside. A government or competing fork might have reason to do it for instance.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:55:40

For mass adoption we need to consider simplicity for the end user. Cryptocurrency just does not have this, period. That is the biggest liability that I can see.
