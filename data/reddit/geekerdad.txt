Just look at that surge in price after MtGox got hacked and it’s BTC stolen!

I’m not much impressed by quoting averages right now, when the largest exchange, Coinbase, is paying ridiculous fees (3-4 times what they could be at least) to perform on chain transactions.

Better to say “if it had worked”.

Let me know when the volume being handled by Bcash is remotely similar to that of Bitcoin. And how well things are working then.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:32:58
Microsoft has reversed its decision and since you can buy as small as 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin, it will take a while before that unit becomes too expensive for someone. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:31:21
You had me at “theoretically”.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:27:25
The fees are settling down. I'd expect 50-60 sat/byte transactions to go through soon. But yeah - capture the hex of that transaction.

Recover means the device the wallet was on has been wiped or destroyed and you need to get back your wallet. You can’t recover a wallet in this scenario with only a pass phrase. You need seed also.

Miners are responsible for writing blocks to the block chain that contain all the transactions. Miners also verify all the other miners’ work. Nodes verify the miners’ work but don’t write blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:26:11
Tell me what happens AFTER you buy your legitimate BTC and want to send it to this wallet. Cuz it looks to me like if you click on "receive", it displays the BCH receive address by default.

I’m not sure what you mean. I don’t have a ledger, I have Trezor. But I believe the concepts are the same.

Real life libertarian sighting. Increasingly rare around here. Take my upvote.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:46:06
Nope. Same as Coinbase . 4-5 days. I am kicking myself for initiating the transfer to GDAX last week and losing out on the $5,700 price....all to save a 1.5% fee. Paid $6,700 today.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:57:25
You can buy without money in the exchange. Coinbase does credit card and Gemini let's you buy with bank transfer at current rate. You don't get the BTC until the transfer clears, but you lock in the price.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:58:07
Not the first BTC transaction, but wasn’t it the first use of BTC as payment in the real world?
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:58:18
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:30:15
So true. I initiated a transfer to avoid the 3% fee on Coinbase and use GDAX instead. In the meantime, BTC went up 20%. Should have just bought with the 3% fee on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:57:56
I'm gunning for $1,800 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:31:44
...and beginners don’t even have a clue what that means
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:45:58
It seems you are right and I jumped to that conclusion. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:01:26
No, the price is locked when you purchase, so it doesn’t matter if BTC goes up 100% while you wait for the transfer. On Coinbase you will get the price when you clicked purchase. You just don’t get the bitcoins in your wallet until the money transfer clears.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:49:17
I am new to bitcoin. Bought my first $750 worth on Coinbase, then got a Trezor and successfully moved my coin there. Went to buy more and thought...wait, I'll do GDAX. Here's the thing though, with GDAX you have to transfer your USD in before you can buy. So in the days while I was waiting for the money to transfer, BTC went up $600. I would have been better to just pay the 1.5% on Coinbase than wait for the money to transfer to get 0%-0.25% on GDAX. Even though Coinbase doesn't give you your BTC immediately when doing a bank transfer, you lock in the price when you hit the buy button.

It didn’t sound like that to me. He didn’t argue that the limit wasn’t there all along. He was just saying that since it hadn’t been hit, it meant it had no effect on the dynamics. I think that’s a reasonable conclusion to draw. The counter argument that it’s impossible to switch to unlimited size because there will be unlimited demand for transactions is not necessarily supported. Ultimately, I agree that scaling off chain with lightning network probably makes the most sense.

I assume you want to print these QR codes to give physical hard copy out?
A private and a public key? Or just the private?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:57:08
Internal website is probably safer than email. As long as there is decent security on your site. You’re literally laying cash on the counter here, so be careful. I don’t know the specific systems that will work for you, but if you have a Python programmer, I believe everything can be done with Python libraries. Essentially you need to create the key pair, load BTC to the public address, and serve the address and private key as QR codes to the user to scan with their wallet software.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:50:12
If you’re going to use quotes at least quote properly. I was talking about a “reasonable conclusion”not a “reasonable limit”. Yes, you describe an important attack to be mindful of.

Search the public address for your wallet on bitcoin.info. See what it shows as the balance.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:52:01
I thought the public address is exposed on the blockchain as a UTXO from the moment the paper wallet has funds added to it. If the fear is quantum computing eliminating the effectiveness of the one way hash algorithms in use in bitcoin, the whole system collapses, does it not?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:16:01
It means people are selling alt coins and loading in to bitcoin before the segwit2x fork coming up, to profit off the new coin most likely.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:10:02
Frozen or "pending"? Sounds like just the wait time for bank transfers to clear.

Oh yes...did a bit more investigation and found what you are talking about. Good article here for anyone following this:

How is it that GDAX let’s me transfer fiat in for no fee, buy BTC for no fee and withdraw BTC to hardware wallet for no fee? All while the mempool is backlogged?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:03:01
Think of it this way, the pin protects your hardware wallet. The password protects BOTH your wallet and your seed words. The pin can be removed or changed at any time and you don’t have to generate new addresses. The password cannot change and neither can the seed words. If your wallet is stolen, the attacker needs your pin and password and can then access your Bitcoin. If he got your password he’d still need your pin. If he gets access to your seed words, he doesn’t need a pin to use them to steal your Bitcoin, but he does need the password.

One of those things will happen, or it will HODL.

I think it’s a sound argument on his part, actually. It doesn’t matter what the limit is if you never hit it. The growth happened without ever hitting a ceiling until recently. I think it’s fair to say that for the first 6years or so it was effectively limitless, which is what he said. Now I wouldn’t take it as far as he did by saying the market should decide and the limit should just be removed, because of the possible trade off in security by more centralization of full nodes. Since full nodes aren’t incentivized, we’ll see less of them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:39:37
Don’t do that. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diverting your IRA contributions is not wise.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:22:14
Super deceptive. A newb would very easily deposit his newly purchased Coinbase or Gemini BTC right into the BCH wallet, which seems to be clearly intentional on the part of this wallet's developer. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:22:10
Yep. A week ago, half that fee was confirming.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:58:35
Also the BTC Price history shown on Coinbase has large sections of flat lines. I'm new to this, but it seems odd.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:56:19
This makes sense to me. Thank you for taking the time to explain. My thought process was more about the arms race for more and more hashrate, which has required the difficulty to be dialed up substantially. I was thinking that all that hashrate should be used to speed the system, so transactions could be verified more quickly, but wasn't accounting for network propagation and forking issues.

Just got a new mac and I set up my old MacBook Pro to run the full node. Took about 20 minutes to set up, including installing GPGSuite to check the hash of the installer. It says 2 weeks to download, but I'm sure that will speed up. I have 75 MBit internet. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:19:38
I'm ignorant to the block size issue. Wouldn't blocks just be smaller if they came out quicker?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:23:57
Keys refer to the way bitcoin works. The only true way to know that you own and can spend bitcoin is to have the private key to your wallet. If you hold coin on Coinbase, you are entrusting them to hold the key and you never know what it is. That said, it's a safe place for new users and people that don't want to get into the nitty gritty of the security necessary to hold their own keys. If you lose the keys, you lose your bitcoin. There's no way to retrieve. Some of the hardware wallets, specifically Trezor, make it easier for you to do it right, though, if you do want to take control of your own keys. Just read their manual on their site and you'll learn a bunch more.  In my opinion, worth the $100 to store them on your own. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:26:37
If you had any article or post to point me to about this issue, I'd love to read more.

From what I can tell, you automatically will have an identical amount of B2X as the BTC you have before the fork. Everyone on the system will. Any client or service that connects to the B2X fork should be able to use your current keys to access them. If you don't have your keys (like in the case of Coinbase) you are at their mercy when it comes to how your account will work.
