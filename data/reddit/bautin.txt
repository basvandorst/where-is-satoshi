Sorry, it wasn't for you in particular, I was just adding to your point.

Yeah, you "sell" coins you don't have at the higher price with a promise to deliver those coins at some future date. The hope is that the value of the coins go down, you scoop them up on the cheap and meet your obligation.
The problem is when the value goes up instead and now you're on the hook to buy the coins that are worth more than your initial sell.

Oh my fucking god. You're like an idiot.
You can't overdraft because well, first, you actually can. You just have overdraft protection. And second, you have additional restrictions on your card. That you placed there.
You didn't "opt out" of overdrafting, you opted in to other services to try and prevent you from doing so.

You know you have an account, but your don't really know anything about it. Which is it?
The Chase Liquid card can be paid into with the Chase apps. Even "depositing checks". 
The bank has a routing number. Not you. That's true of any account though.
Now. There is a possibility that you still have a minor account, which means that you aren't the primary account holder and therefore can't make any changes. You're just authorized to do certain things.
In which case: Get a real bank account.
And that's the bank's routing number. It tells other financial organizations where to get their money. It's basically a fancy address for the bank.

If you have a debit card from your financial institution tied to an account of yours, that's a checking account.
And regardless. Congratulations. Your unique experiences and situations are not representative of the entire world.

_A_ Chase Bank account, not _your_ Chase Bank account. Someone else has an account, they make money off of your money and let you use the money you've given them.
Also, apparently you can even overdraft your prepay. With ACH transfer. Which is the way automatic billpay is set up. Which is the way I said they could still overdraft.
You don't have a bank. You don't have an account. You don't have a debit card. And you can still overdraft. Exactly what were you disagreeing with again?
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:28:41
Oh, that's the _obvious_ answer. But the dude apparently has no self control.

It's not technically returning anything. It's just cancelling a preorder.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:27:46
I like the part where he claimed he "opted out" of overdrafting.
Yeah, you can't really opt out of being financially irresponsible.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:35:26
If you have an automatic billpay set up or still write checks, you can still overdraft.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:42:43
They might just stop allowing him to preorder things.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:48:04
Or get an actual bank account.
The difference is that transfers still have to clear. It's not instantaneous. You could go around, spend all the money plus some on your prepaid and if you're fast enough, it'll clear. Those who process last will be fucked.
So, you just don't take it. Especially if it takes you a while to clear a transaction.
With an actual account, the bank will approve the payment regardless and then put you on the hook for it. Then charge you a fee for basically forcing a loan out of them.
Now, you can apply for overdraft protection which is usually a standing line of credit in case you do go over.

That's true for most subs, you can always go back to when the sub was "more civil".
It's a function of population.

A prepaid card. Because that's what it is.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:18:33
No, it's not. And you don't have a bank. You don't have any sort of account. You can't overdraft, because you can't even draft.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:31:14
Dude, couldn't balance a checkbook. So he often spent more than he had in his account. Or he withdrew money that was needed for an outstanding check that he forgot about.
He claims to have "opted out" of overdraft. But you can't really do that. You can opt out of overdraft protection, but if a business is trying to cash a $25 check against a $10 balance, you're going to have a bad time.
So instead, he runs his little scheme. It's impossible for him overdraft because he's the only one making claims against his account.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:12:38
Really? Because instead of addressing the criticism, you have instead dodged the point and made baseless claims. Even now, you are working from a position that I have "a point of view" about Peterson himself.
I never said that Peterson could be a bad guy. How about you address what I specifically said instead of what you wanted me to have said.
How is "Yeah, but he's saying he's helping" meaningful in anyway? It's not. _You_ have to come up with a better argument. _You_ are the one I am criticizing here. _You_ are the one I have an agenda with. And that agenda is to get you to drop shitty arguments. Use good ones.

It's kind of funny, bitcoin drops a significant percentage and it's a "dip" and you should "buy the dip". We'll all be lambos when it inevitably shoots up again. I mean, you really think McAfee is going to eat his own dick.
Stocks fall 6% and it's "tanking". It'll never recover, the future is crypto.

It's a common tactic used by people who want to deceive you into buying into something.
It implies the narrative that it's stable and everyone else is buying into it and you'll be missing out if you don't.
But if I have 1 of something then make another, I'll have 2 and increased supply by 100%. Do you know many companies doubled production this year? None. We're the fastest growing company.

It is a different question though. Whether or not the technology can be separated from the currency aspect is immaterial. Can an unbacked, decentralized, unregulated currency work?

What accusation? I specifically said I wasn't talking about Peterson and what he's doing. 
I just said that it is possible to position yourself as someone offering help, when what you're really doing is growing a cult instead. Every charismatic cult leader purports to help their subjects, but what they're really interested in is acquiring followers. They aren't interested in actually helping. So the claim that "Well, he's encouraging self-help" is meaningless. Is he actually helping them?
It's fine to believe he is, but to base someone's character on what they claim it is is a short road to being taken advantage of.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:35:43
Not speaking to any specific thing but it is possible to encourage "self-help" as a means of control and influence.
Hell, a lot of the "self-help" industry is about promoting yourself as someone who can direct you to the means to help yourself. Most people have certain opinions on Tony Robbins, but "all he's doing is encouraging people to help themselves".
So let's not pretend that positioning yourself as a demagogue to a certain segment of the population isn't self-serving in some manner.
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:18:17
I don't really have any feeling towards Peterson either way. I know he's fairly popular among certain circles, has a philosophy that's summed up as "clean your room", and a couple of other things.
You're really reaching here. And wrong. You are also chastising me for "speculating about ulterior motive" when it's you who is doing that to me.
But if you want examples of people who have used the guise of help in order to line their personal coffers or reach influence in some manner, all you have to do is look to your cult leaders. Jim Jones, Koresh, Manson. Your despots like Castro, Stalin, Mao.
And I'm not expressing skepticism against Peterson. I'm simply saying that your argument for him is bad. I'm sorry that you can't handle criticism. Or that you can't find any other quality besides "markets self help to incels" to use as evidence that he's whatever is being discussed up top.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:28:41
Which is why we don't judge leaders by their claims. And we don't judge people by their stated intentions.
You are doing some backflips to try and make it seem like I'm saying something I'm not.
To give an example using nobody being talked about so far: Bill Gates. We aren't judging him because he's saying he wants to cure malaria. We judge him for actually attempting to cure malaria. For taking demonstrative positive steps to doing so. And while I believe the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation accepts donations, they've also dedicated a large portion of their personal fortune to the task. And as far as can be told, he doesn't seem to be doing so to gain any sort of influence. If anything, he's using influence to bring attention to the problems he wants solved.
I don't care that you're defending Peterson. I care that you're using bad logic to do so. If you were using the Epicurean argument to defend atheism, I'd also call you out on that because it's a shitty argument.
