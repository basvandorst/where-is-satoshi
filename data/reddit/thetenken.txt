price currently chilling sideways (last hour) but who knows what will happen during bedtime, set up some buy orders.
9540 - quarter of my usual DCA
9450 - half my dca
9250 - 1 usual dca
feel good about filling first too but won't be disappointing if it goes back up either :) 
if you need someone to support you in buying some rn I'll say yeah, if you want to sell and need someone to stop you then yes don't do that.

Set a buy limit order, you never know could fall again to that price point

Using that same example as before your profit before tax is $1000, but let's say you bought in at 2 bitcoin at $13000 but some huge emergency comes up and you need cash desperately so you have to sell even though price is $12000. 
You sell both bitcoin you have but at a loss of -$2000. If those are the only taxable events you made that year so $1000 - $2000 so your NET capital gain is -1000 which you can deduct that 1000 on your tax form. So it would be in your favor to declare your loss. 
As always make sure to read up for yourself and verify words of me an internet stranger. I been doing some research on this myself since it's pretty confusing and somewhat interested in how the IRS will or will not change how it taxes cryptocurrency in the future.

Bitcoin will never hit zero because I will buy all of it before it gets there ;)
Anytime you sell you create a taxable event so you’re supposed to pay taxes on your net capital gain. 
Anytime you day trade you take that risk of not being able to get back in lower but that’s just how it is. 
If you sell crypto you’ve had for over a year it’s at a lower capital gains tax versus held less than a year it would be taxed at your normal income tax rate. 
Say you bought one btc $13000 and sold at $14000, you made profit of 1000 and so let’s just say you’re taxed at 20% that’s $200 with profit of $800

you only lost $30 if you sell. 
if you really need that $120 badly then yes but next time shouldn't spend more money then you can afford to lose.
i think most people here would tell you to buy the dip and hold onto your butt
if you think bitcoin will go down and not come back up then yes sell, if you think it'll get higher than 13.6k then no
