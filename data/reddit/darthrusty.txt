@_date: 2017-08-10 21:30:55
Correct.  There are things you can do to unstick the transaction.  But until the transaction is confirmed or cancelled, the btc is inaccessible.  This is what I'm trying to explain to OP.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:49:39


First, they only admitted it was a failure because it was a good PR more.  They didn't actually believe it.
Second, the SEC under Trump has announced that while they're keeping an eye on crypto, they haven't made any moves as of yet and decided against pressing charges but instead just issued a warning.  Under Clinton, I have no doubt the SEC would have issued full charges and would have already written up excessive regulations in an attempt to shut down crypto exchanges.
Fully agree that Trump and his entire administration is authoritarian and Sessions' push for harsh drug enforcement and civil asset forfeitures are an absolute atrocity.  But I don't think they're smart enough to even begin to try and go after crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:19:02
I don't think i called it anything.  Just said you don't have access to your btc while it's in transit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:18:26
Correct.  Which is what I told OP.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:56:04

Will be interesting to see crypto become the new safe haven that gold is now.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:34:50
It's a transaction that is sitting in the void waiting for an open space on a block to be recorded.  You don't lose the coin but you also can't access it until it is confirmed.
Edit: can't use it until it is confirmed or returned.

It seems almost like a hostile take over.  Especially because the narrative seems to push that the goal was always store of value and not payment currency.  If you've been in for a long time, I feel for you.......sort of (them gainzzz tho).  Seriously though, I hope btc is able to find itself and sort out all the infighting.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:16:12
I'd be interested in reading a history of bitcoin to see when/how the flip from currency to store of value played out.  When I got into crypto late/'16, early/'17, it was still very much meant as a payment method.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:00:07
Ok, so don't ask about long confirmation times or you're attacking BTC. And don't call out anyone claiming transferring BTC is an attack or you're a shill.  Seems like a perfectly viable and sustainable community model.  Good luck to you in what I can only assume is your sophomore year in high school.

Account moves 7000 btc to exchange.
"I've had three people offer me 200k btc"
Seems to me that the 200k someone is allegedly trying to sell of is a bigger story than the 7k that moved or the 35k sold in the previous round.  I love that they just make a random passing mention of that 200k and then go back to the 7k as if it matters in the face of 200k.

There have been numerous articles over the last few months (year?) about Venezuela as a case study for widespread acceptance of crypto as a currency.

Right.  Which is why I added the "humanitarian tragedy" part.

Absolutely agree tha the moon talk ruins the discussion.  I'm pretty heavily invested in numerous tokens but am far more interested in the advances in technology that they bring as opposed to the gains (which I won't complain about).  That's one reason I keep trying to look into the Venezuelan adoption of bitcoin.  It's very much a test of bitcoin as a currency and is even more interesting in the face of the scaling debate and numerous forks.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:02:08
I do not know the exact answer to either but both are exactly what I've been trying to read up on since last week.  I know that this is the Fed's job (stabilize rates as a monetary policy) so the act of injecting funds into the repo market isn't bad in and of itself. It's one of the tools the Fed uses to keep rates and liquidity stable. But I don't know if there's a magic time period where it becomes an issue itself or becomes a sign of a larger problem (i.e. recession). 
I don't think the Fed will stop if the loans have a positive effect on rates and liquidity. If the overnight loans stop working to relieve the rates, I'm sure they have other measures they can try, but with an already lowered Fed rate and an ever increasing deficit, I'm not sure how many options they actually have at their disposal. 
IMO, the overnight lending isn't a bad thing on its own, but is a sign of other potential issues.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:08:22
It's not a total of $128B. It's $50B one day, then that amount is repaid immediately, then $75B the next day, then that amount is repaid immediately. So it's a net gain by the Fed of whatever the interest paid is (~2.25%) on the overnight loan.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:04:07
Is there a source for this seemingly random chart?

So that was my biggest question.  If the Bolivar is so devalued, how are people able to use it to purchase any meaningful amount of BTC or any other currency.  Sorry about your plight and I truly hope things get better for you guys soon.  
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:10:11
It's not a cumulative amount. Each day the loan is paid back plus interest. I don't know at what point it becomes a serious issue but the fed hasn't injected hundreds of billions in total, it's just issuing literal overnight loans of 50-75B. Again, I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing as I'm not super familiar with the direct effects, just making sure there's an understanding of the operations of the action.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:03:21
The Fed has been injecting $50-75 billion a day into the overnight lending market for a week now (the same $50-75B each day as the money is paid back in the morning). It is the Fed's job to do this in order to stabilize rates at a specific level, but it becomes an issue if the market doesn't stabilize itself after an extended time, or if the Fed has to inject an ever growing amount.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:02:57
Is there any sort of magic timeline where the Fed goes from "this is just something we just need to do temporarily" to "well, shit"? What are the next steps if the overnight loans either continue for an extended period or begin increasing at a drastic level?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:07:12

@_date: 2017-05-01 19:12:44
Yep.  Both the investment aspect and decentralization aspect of crypto are what bring me to it.  I don't use it to hide income and have thus far recorded gains to report come tax time, but I like that crypto provides a safe space from gov't's grubby fingers.  Something they can never touch.

Outside of a lack of merchants accepting crypto, my biggest reason for not using it is exactly as you state; I don't want to buy a $1 soda today that turns out to be a $100 soda a few weeks from now.  It's the story of the $3 million pizza all over again.  
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:13:33
Not that I know of.  But then again, those currencies aren't traded, they're simply used to purchase in game items, so they're strictly internal use currencies.  Would be nice if crypto were treated the same but I think becuase they are traded on exchanges, the gov't sees them more as an asset with taxable realized gains.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:09:04

1) I see litecoin positioning itself as the everyday use coin. Especially if the value stays less than $1000 and finds a somewhat stable ratio to BTC.
