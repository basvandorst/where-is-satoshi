"Mom bring that back ASAP please. Keep it safe and don't let anyone but the cashier touch it."
That shit would be bubble-wrapped on my desk in less than an hour.

In the US, politicians are very careful about voting for anything that would increase the consumer price of fuel. Sure, the gas industry changes prices, but no politician wants the "Gas is too expensive!" buck to stop with them, because its one of the things that nearly every voter, on both sides of the political spectrum, has to buy on a regular basis. If you get blamed for the gas prices your next re-election just got twice as hard.

If you would read the entire thread, the customer contacted support shortly after opening multiple accounts, the act violating the terms and conditions. 
So the company had a chance to deny the guy service, and conveniently failed to take any action on the matter until he had won a substantial amount of money.
I would further argue that asking the support line if he's OK to gamble after opening a second account would warrant a KYC check, or at LEAST the customer should have been informed at that point of how to make the request formal.

So you let someone continue using the site after they admitted directly to the business that they were breaking your Term&amp;Conditions, then denied his winnings at the door on the way out.
I dunno, if someone came into my casino's customer service dept. and asked if card counting would be ok, I'd probably ban him at THAT point, not wait until he tries to cash.

* Don't invest with money you can't afford to lose
* Secure your keys/words in 3 ways in 3 different *physical* places
* HODL, look at the price history of bitcoin with them and make sure they know that long-term holding is the most likely strategy to pay off.

whats the point of encrypting your wallet words? Now you've just got another private key to look after.

housing is not an invenstment for the vast majority of people. it is a place to live, and the value of it goes down over time, inflation and maintenance will likely eat away at resale value.
