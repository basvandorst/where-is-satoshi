Basically mining is pretty much generating hashes until one works. BTC and NMC both use the same format of hash generated the same way. So if you think of a hash as a "key" you're basically generating one key, and then testing the same "key" in both a BTC "lock" and an NMC "lock" to see if it works on either one.
(They're probably doing this with *all* hashes sent to the pool, and simply only hand out the NMC to people who specifically *ask* for it by setting up a NMC address for their share.)

 maybe?
My idea wouldn't be particularly nice looking, just a random piece of most likely hot-rolled or cold-rolled mild steel with the scale cleaned off and the alphanumeric keys stamped in. The main point is function - stamp it nice and deep, and it shouldn't be too affected by fire or floods, other than maybe a bit of rust from either (which is why you stamp it *deep*), and a bit of clearcoat (or wax, or maybe cosmoline or whatever) should help against water if you're that concerned.
Occurs to me that if you don't have access to a bridgeport, other options for removing the keys afterwards (assuming you don't care too much about re-using the stock for new keys) would be to run a chopsaw or angle grinder through/over the keys. (Maybe eating the edge off with the chopsaw repeatedly until the keys are fully gone, rather than just chopping through the middle with it, to avoid partially readable characters being left behind.) Or if you want to be creative, take a welder to it and either run a bead over the keys or better yet just burn right through them.

After emptying the wallet, where one apparently would traditionally shred and/or burn a paper wallet from what I've read, run a face mill or endmill through it, deburr the edges with a file, and stamp a new set of keys in its place.

bitcointip/altcointip were "on chain", using individual wallets for each member, which (at least in the case of bitcointip, I don't know for altcointip) the user could gain direct access to. Even if all of reddit suddenlty evaporated, users could get their coins from their wallet.
Changetip, on the other hand, has a combined wallet for everyone that only they have the private keys for, and does user-to-user transactions "off chain" - they simply change who has how many BTC in their database, as the BTC are in a combined wallet anyways. (Well, they keep most of it in offline wallets as I remember, but from the user's end it's all the same.)
Both methods have advantages/disadvantages. On-Chain let you have more access to your wallet if something went wrong, but off-chain avoids confirmation waiting for user-to-user transactions, and also avoids blockchain transaction fees for user-to-user transactions, which is particularly useful if you make many small tips.

I remember seeing a thing a while back called a "spinthariscope" and wondering if one of those mounted to a CCD would make a passible source of entropy? I know CCDs do have a certain amount of noise that lets one tell if a particular camera took a particular picture (if the noise isn't properly obscured, at least), but coupling it to a spinthariscope and using it as on/of for each pixel rather than paying attention to a range of levels may make it less of a problem possibly?
Would be particularly interesting if there was an easy way to make a little USB box with that stuff and some glue logic and so forth that all you need to do is plug it in and the computer will recognise it as an entropy input device, not sure if there's a way for it to hook itself in in place of the stock PRNGs some devices have though (android tablets? Is there an easy way to 'hook' PRNG calls on those or something?), may still need programs to be written to specifically look for entropy devices... Also maybe give it a switch on the side or bottom to put it into a KBD/Mouse emulation mode for software coded to use those as sources of entropy.

Well, if 1 uBTC were to equal 1 USD, then 1 mBTC would be 1,000 USD, and 1 BTC would be 1,000,000 USD.
(Or is "bits" a decimal place off from uBTC one way or the other? I can never manage to remember if it is or not, so the math may need adjusted for "bits". I'll leave that for someone else to deal with though, the math definitely works out for uBTC though.)

So clearly the answer is to make the premises much larger, using all the extra area for some other non-electricity-intensive purpose, diluting the overall kWh/sqft to below the given amount.

mBTC makes more sense than "bits" to me too, yeah.
BTC is the primary unit (like watts, or amps, or liters or whatever). So 10^-3 of them should be mBTC.

Basically, each keypair has one public and one private key, which are tied to each other with fancy math.
If it helps, you can think of the blockchain like a bunch of those locking mailboxes with a slot in the top. Anyone with the address (public key) to one can put money in, but only the person(s) with the key to the lock (private key) can open it and take things out.

Reminds me of all the games that let you spend real money to buy virtual stuff, like a new shirt for your avatar, or a paintbrush to recolor your virtual pet, or a fancy hat to wear while you shoot at the other players. or something else like that. Except in this case the entire game is that you're spending real money on the virtual gem.
I could see them gradually adding more gems though, and using the index page as a listing with a little thumbnail of each. This one becoming "The Original Bitcoin Gem", and the others being things like "The Bitcoin (Emerald|Ruby|Sapphire|Topaz|&amp;c.), with only one of each particular gem. (Perhaps expand into things like turquoise, lapis, amethyst, tiger's eye, gold nugget, &amp;c. eventually, also.)
Of course, since there's no option to not sell (that option would break the game anyways), the only way to increase your virtual "collection" is to buy the gems back again for increasing amounts. Even when they all hit ridiculous prices (and new ones would probably get bumped up to the price level of the older ones pretty quickly - though I can see the "Original" staying slightly higher), somebody's sure to want at least one just to call it "theirs" - especially since if someone else buys it again, they're not actually out anything - if nothing else, they've gained slightly.

Well, if the offending fans are against the side of the housing (like the one in the back of a computer), you could probably remove it, and use some sort of ducting to attach a larger fan with a similar CFM to the outside in its place. (Larger fans with the same CFM tend to be quieter. Also, try for a fan with metal blades and a metal housing, those are usually a lot quieter than fans with plastic blades/housings. (For example, an 80mm Vantec Tornado (plastic) moves 84.1 CFM at 55.2 dBA, while a 150mm ebm-papst 7112N (metal) moves 211.9 CFM for 55 dBA (about the same). In this case, the sound level stayed the same for nearly triple the CFM - For the same CFM, the dBA would be lower. Basically small/quiet/airflow, pick two.))
Edit: Re: "has to blow less air". Do try to stay to at least the same CFM if not slightly higher, or you can compromise its cooling ability and overheat things inside, and overheating its insides is bad.

Unfortunately, the closest thing to a "miner" I have is the PCI (not PCIe, just PCI) GT430 in my old AthlonXP computer... :-(
If I *did* have a bunch of old miners, I'd probably be trying to see how many of them I could keep going at once without tripping either of the breakers for my dorm room... :-P

Basically I've found the easiest way to think of it is this:
Think of the blockchain as a big logbook, listing out who owns how many bitcoins, who they got them from, who *they* got them from, and so on all the way up to whoever initially created them.
Except it doesn't know you by name, it only knows what key pair owns how much.
The public key is what you put out as a "give coins to me here" address.
The private key is a special way to tell the huge logbook (blockchain) using crypto that "Yes, I really am the owner of (matching public key), and I do indeed wish to transfer X bitcoins from its total to (some other pair's public key).
What the wallet is is basically just a fancy keyring to hang your public/private key pairs on.
(I know this description is somewhat simplified, and likely technically inaccurate in a few places besides, but it seems to get the gist of it down, at least enough to explain it to someone who has no idea what's going on without confusing them too badly.)

Just because there'd be no more *new* coins, doesn't mean you can't still *get* coins for mining. Where do you think the [transaction fees]( go to?
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:33:28
I believe it's also possible to manually create transactions such as paying address B from address A along the lines of "send (from addressA) (0.75 to addressB) (0.2499 to addressA)" (Which would result in 0.75 going to addressB, a 0.0001 transaction fee, and the remainder going back to addressA.)
Though I also remember something about reusing addresses that way being a bad idea, something about some kind of attack that it could (at least theoretically?) leave you open to...?

Yes, a *bit* is on or off. A Bit*coin* is made of many bits.
And much like a bar of gold, it can be cut up into smaller pieces, which can be cut smaller themselves, and so on. Except where with gold you can only divide it down to an atom, bitcoins can always have more places after the decimal added to the protocol if they're ever really needed.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:43:00
Well yes, the public key is one-way generated from the private key, true. I do understand that part.
But it is still useful to think of public/private keys as a "pair" even if you were to re-generate the public one each time you use it rather than keeping them around as a pair. (Among other things, ever notice that paper wallets tend to show both, not just the private key?) And as I mentioned, for things like watch-only wallets on devices that you don't completely trust (or may have stolen easily), you may only have the public key stored in the wallet, and the private key stored on a more secure device or even only on a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:09:04
I could see the QR code also containing a payment amount, especially if it's just passing a Bitcoin URI, for example one using [the simple syntax form of BIP 0021](
    bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;[?amount=&lt;amount&gt;][?label=&lt;label&gt;][?message=&lt;message&gt;]
Obviously, the user would be both shown &lt;amount&gt; and then promptred to accept/decline (send/cancel) the transaction by their client.

I got to the same results before I posted by **21000000/.00000001=2.1E15** satoshi, but yeah. :-)
The point was that they were talking about "only" 21m bitcoins, and didn't seem to be factoring divisibility in.
And if 2.1E15 satoshis *still* aren't enough for them, they can wait for the day more places are added after the decimal in the protocol. :-P

Well, you have their name and address. Mail them a bill, with a payment due date. Maybe even use the fancy kind of mail that tells you they did indeed get it. And if they fail to pay after a bill or two are recieved, that's what those annoying collection agencies are for, right? &gt;:-) (Might be able to file some sort of lien on them until they pay you even, not sure on that...)
Normally I wouldn't suggest those things, doing them isn't being very nice to the person on the other end, but with the buyer being such a blatant asshat, well... They kind of have it coming.

Once you install the program and run it, it will generate a wallet, and give you keys. The public keys are the adddress bitcoins are sent to. The private keys are used to spend the bitcoins.
Keep the wallet file backed up, because if you lose the keys, you lose the bitcoins they correspond to. (Also don't give other people copies of your wallet, because if they have your private keys, they can spend your bitcoins.)

@_date: 2013-10-07 17:17:11
I still say that a wallet is more like a big keychain, just with pairs of addresses (public/private) instead of funny-shaped bits of metal.
And an encrypted wallet is like taking one of those big keychains and throwing it into a safe.
You can even make multiple copies of those keychains full of keys (non-encrypted wallets), and throw them in safes (add encryption) with different combinations (passwords), or several safes in different places with the same combination (password), or even just leave the keyring laying around by itself (non-encrypted wallet) if you so choose.
As long as someone has access to one of the keyrings (either by finding one laying around unprotected, or by opening the safe with the combination (decrypting the encryption with the password)), the keys can be used to access the coins in the blockchain with the keys (the private addresses from the pairs).

Once they hit a certain point, nobody's getting new coins, them included.


And so what if they set a transaction fee of X amount? A lot of places already want a specific transaction fee to process the transaction, yet lower (or sometimes even zero) fee transactions do eventually go through anyways, because there are still miners and/or pools who will still do the work in exchange for the lower fees. (As I remember, the Eligius pool will accept all sorts of strange things and happily mine them into a block...)

Huh. So it's *explicitly* specifying "Bitcoin"? I guess we know where alts like Litecoin and so on are about to become more popular if this somehow does end up ending in a ban. :-P

Couple quick questions - 
1) How much "tip" would it take you to at least break even on it? (I may be cheap sometimes, but I'm not *that* cheap that I'd not at least tip to break-even if not even more.)
2) I noticed that the site doesn't mention attaching a message with a code to the payment anymore, and as I remember, it used to say something about that - Is that not a thing anymore? (In which case I could probably even pay with the tip bot by tipping the payment address, since I'm lazy (and bitcoin-qt mostly just fails horribly and in all sorts of creative ways on my ancient AthlonXP computer anyways...

As far as cooling goes, you could probably point a cheap case fan connected to a generic power brick at the Erupter for basic cooling. (My GT430 didn't have a fan, just a heatsink, so I attached an 80mm case fan to the card's heatsink, it really does keep it a lot cooler.)

What phone? What does/doesn't seem to work?
If the main issue is screen damage, maybe buy a damaged one of the same model with a good screen off eBay or similar and put the good screen on your phone? Even if the rest of the phone is halfway trashed, as long as you can access your data that way to transfer it, that's all you really need, right?
(Depending on the phone, for all I know, there may be some way to mount it to a computer to transfer files either by USB or if all else fails possibly JTAG, but I couldn't say for sure.)

The "addresses" in your wallet are really key pairs, one public, and one private (it usually doesn't show you the private ones unless you ask it the right way). It's easier to think of a wallet as a big keychain, with all your "keys" on it. You can even make copies of the keys and add the copies to another keyring (importing a keypair into another wallet). If you only add the public key of the pair, then it's watch-only, of course, and will not let you move your bitcoins from that address with that wallet. (Which actually has several very good uses, but that's a bit beyond the scope of our current discussion.)
What these provate keys do is to "sign" a transaction (apply a special 1-way algorhythm with the key and transaction as inputs, creating a signed output thing), to tell the network that "Yes, I really am who I say I am, and I really do own this address, and I really do want to transfer X bitcoins from this address that I own to another address that I may or may not own."
Make any more sense?

Well, let's say you had a pound of gold worth X amount. suddenly, the price of gold doubles. Do you have any more gold? No, you still have a pound of gold.
The quantity of something (like one bitcoin, or a pound of gold, or whatever) is not the same as the value of it. And no matter how many times you divide it, or how much the value of it changes, the quantity will still stay the same. (Well, people losing their keys may cause the *available* quantity to decrease, but the total quantity will never increase once they've all been mined.)
