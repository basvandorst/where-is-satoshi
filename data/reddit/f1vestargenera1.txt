I'm curious why you didn't use an SSD? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:29:23
Well yes the performance might not be different. But if I were to carry something like that around, I wouldn't want to have a spinning disk for storage. It just feel it's bound to get corrupt since it gets moved around so much. Idk, I could be wrong but that was my initial thought. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:51:09
In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with having small fees on each transaction. Obviously the users would want as small a fee as they can get, but the system won't work in the long run without fees. This is okay.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:55:57
The dream is possible imo.
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:08:46
UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT. that means all it takes is TWO people could keep it "alive". Very fascinating in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:54:23
To build on this, I think it's possible for mining to become so decentralized that everyone has small micro-mining processors that can generate a similar amount of income as the person spends in transactions. So as to almost negate the transaction fees?

The "Gaming Culture" has less to do with actual games and more on the idea of depersonification of whoever you are dealing with. Its the same situation in other areas of the internet. The idea that EVERY single person that you type to on the internet or in video games is a real, live person is something that humans (in general) don't grasp well. Its a lot easier to justify being toxic to a piece of text on a screen than a person who is actually standing in front of you. It happens everywhere.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:06:15
I do agree with you, I too wish people could grow up and be kind to others. I find it easier to brush off toxicity when I realize the reason people are toxic in the first place is just part of human nature and they might not be bad people, but just maybe not fully aware of their actions.
Welcome to the world of crypto and I hope you stick around and continue to learn everything you can about bitcoin and its technology.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:24:49
Logically, I think you might be correct. Lets just say you use a lower than average fee for your transaction. Your transaction might not make it onto the next immediate blocks, It might take a few blocks to get included. Once your transaction is recorded on the blockchain, any block added on top of the block that your transaction is included in, is going to add another confirmation to your transaction. In theory, blocks should be solved on average every 10 minutes (this doesnt always happen, but on average it is the case), so the confirmations after your first should be consistently 10 minutes.
Delays could also happen in confirmations because of miners not finding a solution to the algorithm. This part is random, so sometimes it doesnt happen 10 minutes on the dot.
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:28:13
It seems most people see it as a way to make money.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:47:11
I've been buying since I first heard of the technology in January. And I haven't stopped.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:07:46
This isn't a game =)
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:47:56
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:20:22
Pain is temporary.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:02:54
Gold has no fundamental value either. Things only have value when humans decide that they do.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:10:54
Don't go to .com!
It's a scam site and tries to trick new people into thinking they are buying actual Bitcoin.
The real Bitcoin site is bitcoin.org 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:18:24
Or is the idea for you, to get rich quick?
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:21:09
Thank you. Let's make the world a better place.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:23:19
Feels good! The more coins held by the community and the fewer held by whales, the better off we all are.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:00:07
I'm unsure of the point of doing that. All i'm saying is, I think that's what she was referring to. Of course I could be wrong, That's how I interpreted it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:16:42
Agreed. Don't you think though, that until we get a global general consensus on that idea, exchanges are necessary? For people to join the network.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:57:47
What makes $4400 the next big level?
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:37:16
I think you might be confused. 
The issue is making large payments relative to other amounts that are stored on the network. If the price goes up, people would keep less Bitcoin on the network. You could still make a "large" payment relative to what others have on their channels.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:55:50
Well done I think. You sir get an upvote.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:57:17
Looking into the future... Why would we use exchanges? We will just be using a block chain network.. no exchanges. That would be the goal right?
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:45:03
Would you mind explaining your thought?
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:51:25
I agree with you. 
To get Bitcoin where we want it to be is going to take a lot of work. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and has a long road ahead of it. What's different here is that Bitcoin is a community driven technology. There is no company or organization behind the wheel doing the work for us. This means that the weight of growing this tech will fall on everyone in the community. We need to get involved and help in any way we can.
I am fairly new to the scene and am just starting to get involved. I just downloaded the block chain and am now running a full node out of my home. I am looking into what it takes to run an ASIC. I am slowly buying bitcoins from cash I can afford to invest. I do not want to become that annoying guy who pushes bitcoin in everyone's faces, but I will slowly start spreading word and recommendations to it as it grows and becomes more stable.
I believe in Bitcoin and am trying to pull my weight.
Let's keep this technology alive!
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:39:02
I'm confused, you say it's not manipulation, but instead that we just got done being manipulated? Regardless, I think we should stop selling, and just buy and hold. That's my opinion.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:32:14
I don't think she said separate Bitcoin from ITS block chain. She said something more along the lines of seeing the block chain technology as a stand alone technology without an associated currency. Like for example for the technology to be used in a business that doesn't employ a coin along with the chain.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:39:03
Put your bitcoins on a paper wallet and you could literally say the same thing for it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:15:03
What do exchanges have to do with this? When I take Bitcoin and put it on a paper wallet, the only way to get access to the bitcoins is to have physical access to the paper. Just like the gold in your scenario. Hide the paper wallet in your safe and guard it with a gun. It's just as secure.
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:55:22
Based on your text, I can tell that you might not mean value in litterally the price in USD, but instead the value and health of the community and technology as a whole. This is good.
Obvious answers would be running a full node, and a miner as to have a say in the future of Bitcoin. Also buying the coin and holding or spending it. 
If you have any knowledge or are willing to gain the the knowledge of computer science and help by creating the code for future implementation. From what I can tell, this is where the community needs the help the most. Bitcoin is not ready to tackle a global economy. It still has a lot of technical issues to overcome before it can be used by everyone on the planet. The faster we can get technical issues fixed, the faster adaption and value will increase.
I think that everyone has their role to play if they want to help. The issues that I'm looking to help with (since I don't have any computer science knowledge) are I'm running a full node, looking into what it takes to run a miner, I'm buying small weekly amounts of Bitcoin to store away. I'm also trying to spread word of the technology, not just the price, this is important as people should see Bitcoin as a great technology that could change the world, and not just a speculative investment.
I hope you can find ways to help the cause friend.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:52:34
You made an account just to post this?
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:30:16
No need to be facetious. It was a legitimate question. Not everyone is going to know everything about the community. Let's be kind.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:51:50
I think it's easier to store and transfer $1 million in gold than an equivalent value of oil or iron. It's more valuable, so it takes up much less volume. What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:31:24
I think that maybe you are confused about the definition of a bank. Because miners are certainly not banks. Also, you can't hack this network. If you know how to hack the Bitcoin network, please do! We could learn a thing or two from your attack. As far as hacking individual person's networks, we will simply have to learn to keep our value in places that can't be hacked. Like on the network.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:30:45
I think I misspoke in my first comment to you. I didn't start buying as soon as I heard about it. I heard about it in January and bought at 11k. I'm not so bothered to check what month that was in, because like I said, I don't care about that.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:07:06
Right on. Spend and replace.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:59:00
I see your point.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:09:19
You are correct. And that is very important. But I also think it is important to put the technology into the hands of everyone (not just rich people having a HUGE majority of the  value), I want this technology and value in the community, in every day Life, with people like you and me, who browse Reddit. Because we are (for the most part) good people. So... Hold onto your bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:19:17
I wouldn't mind if it dropped even more. That way I can get more haha. But I don't want YOUR Bitcoin, I want the whales' bitcoins. Let them sell to me, and sell to you too. The cheaper the better for us.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:11:51
I've bought some products online with it..
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:13:40
I like this.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:08:19
Yes! This would help so much. And we don't necessarily need them so much in 1st world countries that have access to better resources and banks. The most beneficial places to have them would be in places that are poor and unbanked. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:24:25
I would try to convince him to educate himself on Bitcoin and it's protocol and principals. Then he/she can make that decision for themselves.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:20:47
Don't keep your money in exchanges. Not your keys, not your coins. You're right though, people will have to learn better practices when it comes to who they let control their currency. The whole idea here is to control your OWN money, and be your OWN bank. It's possible, but most people don't realize that idea is possible because it's never been possible before. All we need is more education.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:03:00
Haha! as a lot of this community would like to do during times like these.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:21:40
Can you explain why you dislike CNBC having a real-time price tracker? Seems pretty harmless to me.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:17:50
I'm not saying they are buying. I'm saying they are selling. Buy their Bitcoin, and hold it, so they can't get it back. That's the idea right? Of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:47:09
When gold was used as a currency, I cant think of anything during that time period that gave it practical value. You are right, today we can use gold for technical purposes like in electronics. But before the industrial revolution, it was strictly used as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:24:13
No, I didn't buy right away. I didn't know what it was. I first bought a small amount at $11k. And like I said in other comments. I've been buying since. I don't mind the price, I'm well off enough with US dollars.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:05:41
I think most people wouldn't pefer to keep a large value of Bitcoin on a network that is relatively new and untested for payments that are much smaller than they originally alloted for. That's what I would do, I would pull value out of the channel if the price of the coin went up a significant amount. Just because it's not needed
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:50:33
There are ways to code programming into Bitcoin to do those same transactions you are talking about. I'm not a programmer so I don't have much technical knowledge, but I'm pretty sure those are non-issues that just need time to be implemented.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:36:45
That's not entirely true. Spending is good. But so is holding. They are both beneficial in different ways.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:29:46
0 to 100 real quick
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:04:52
I am right there with you friend. 
Here's to hoping Bitcoin can become everything we envision it to be! ��
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:58:05
And that's fine. As long as you're not losing money to the whales trying to manipulate the system. Or maybe you ARE a whale. /s
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:14:00
Do you mean blocksize when you say capacity? Because when I hear the word capacity I think of the 21 million Bitcoin capacity that will never be able to be increase by any attack. 
I understand your point about attacks being good in the sense that we can learn from them and make the network more robust. But I think your choice of words are where my confusion lies.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:39:49
I'm just trying to help the technology. I'm not going to be hostile with you. If you don't agree with me that's okay.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:57:41
I didn't down vote anything. But what do you mean by saying an attack that increases Bitcoin capacity?
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:35:00
I understand now.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:50:29
Bitcoin is not the market. It is revolutionizing the market. Bitcoin is a technology. A technology that I believe in and want to support.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:12:54
So you are manipulating! Haha. That's okay though because I trust you over the elite rich (For some reason). Do you actually think the price will keep falling?
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:34:00
Totally agree. We need more bitcoins held by the community and fewer held by whales and financial elite! The price, for people who actually care about the technology and the vision, is just secondary.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:02:22
I think there is manipulation. Maybe both.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:44:56
Haha no
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:43:44
I'm not worried about an investment in the currency. I'm well off, and very privileged without Bitcoin. I'm not here to gain value.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:43:15
Not everyone buys Bitcoin to make a profit. Some of us are simply here because we believe in the idea that Bitcoin can better the world. 
And personally, I think people like you who are only in it for the money and profit, are parasitic in nature and do a lot more harm than good. But maybe that's exactly your plan. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:05:51
Also, I think what you said implies that you agree there is manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:50:52
I don't know of any resources to help with your question specifically. But I just wanted to say that this community needs people like you. We need developers and people willing to work on the ecosystem. I hope you can learn everything you need to and are successful with what you want to do. Keep doing good man, props.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:44:27
Okay, you are TECHNICALLY correct. But when gold was used as a currency, the technology that utilizes the physical properties of gold (electronics, etc) did not exist.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:20:56
Okay yeah but I meant more like WHALES ya know? Like corporations and stuff.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:13:21
That's actually not what I'm saying.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:47:53
Oh, reading your first paragraph I thought you were talking about cash. 
I might suggest you educate yourself on what "money" is. And why "money" never really has any inherent value. Unless you want to have to trade cotton for eggs and milk.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:12:19
I agree. Most certainly.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:40:46
That's why I think we should buy their coins when they sell them, and keep them for ourselves.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:11:13
But if you are a company, you can use the block chain technology without needing to incentive miners. Just run your own miners and pay the electric bill as a running business expense. Blockchains don't need to be decentralized.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:33:01
I already have electrum 3.0.6 on my desktop. I don't know how to update it to 3.1. do I have to completely redownload the new version?
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:43:31
Thanks for the post. Straight to the point with some good information. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:55:06
Why do we care about Satoshi? I get it, like he was the one who published Bitcoin, but he shouldn't have any more say about what happens to Bitcoin than you or I or any one of the developers, miners, or users of Bitcoin. That's the whole idea, it's supposed to be decentralized without leadership. Why put so much weight on one person and their opinion?
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:04:59
Actually not a fact. I've never sold Bitcoin for real money, I've only ever sold Bitcoin for real products. So again, you say "fact" but probably meant to say "assumption". Maybe English isn't your best language, understandable.
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:29:43
You're talking about something like SAO.
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:47:52
My bad, I didn't open your album. Didn't see the second picture. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:23:28
Bitcoin is not an English only currency.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:36:26
I'm with you there, I've been looking for a good place to get actual Bitcoin news and not just marketing. I've just started using bitcointalk.org and it seems alright, but I just have a hard time being on that site for a long time without getting tired of it. 
If you find any other place. Post it here for us would ya?
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:47:37
I don't believe that just because someone makes a chart, that that's how it really is. But i think your point about Reddit being bullish on Bitcoin is not very well thought out. Reddit doesn't even represent a small fraction of the whole crypto community. Just because there is a photo of a lambo on the front page of Reddit, doesn't mean that a large majority of people in the crypto space are not in the "depressed" state. What happened over the past 7 months is certainly depressing for a lot of people.
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:52:08
I would like the same. A lot of bad-mouthing but not much facts to go around.
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:59:50
Where did you find those "facts"? 
Or maybe you meant to say "opinion". Lol
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:21:55
Looks like you don't have any BTC to spend.
