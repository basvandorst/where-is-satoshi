Hello, 
First of all backup your wallet, and create a backup of the backup. There should be a backup option in bitcoin-qt.
Secondly, the wallet is stored at C:/users/username/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin with the blockchain, Its called wallet.dat. Go to this directory and create another backup just to be safe.
When you download and install the new client it won't delete the files in the above location.

I have two questions.
* Firstly I don't know much about ramdisks, but I remember reading on some forum that if your pc crashes while some game is loaded into a ramdisk it could end up causing a lot of issues. Is there any truth to this?
* Secondly, are you only looking for big investors or is there a way in which rather than a few people buying 5 percent equity for 50,000 usd anyone could buy 0.01 percent equity for 100 usd.(in a manner somewhat similar to kickstarter - if share issuing regulation/fees become an issue you could also look into mastercoin/colored coins capabilities in issuing digital assets)

I agree,
I think that ppcoin and namecoin will probably succeed, litecoin will probably beat both for a short period of time, but then crash as soon as an asic is developed capable of mining litecoins, and they lose their only advantage. Ripple will probably do wellish as well, but its a marketplace not actually a currency...

Two of these inflationary currencies already exist. Look up proof of stake.

I think that Bitcoin will capture a large majority of the market for virtual currencies, and most copy cat virtual currencies such as litecoin will fail.
I also think, however, that those virtual currencies which came out early enough, and are different enough might manage to capture small but significant portions of the market. Three currencies I think have a shot are Peercoin, Namecoin, and Mastercoin. Although due to being built atop the bitcoin protocol I'm not sure if mastercoin counts as an entire new currency.
Namecoin : Domain Registration
Peercoin : Proof of stake(Low energy), steady 1 percent inflation, etc...
Mastercoin : Similar to colored coins allows the creation of digital assets, difference is they are backed by mastercoins. Were not actually mined, but produced at a rate of 100 per bitcoin during a one month funding period, all coins were sent to donators.  Think that they will probably do very well as they take the idea of colored coins, build upon it, and expedite development through the initial 6000 invested bitcoins being divided into multiple bounties.

Regarding said pruning, is there a built in function which prunes the block chain, or ...

I manage to occasionally day trade For minor profit by
* only trading when I can stay and monitor the price for a few hours
* trading in lower altcoins
* comparing prices across several sites, so if the price of peer coins is suddenly ten percent higher on site a than b I sell those I have in site b, rebuy on site a, and send the profits to my wallet. More funds from wallet to site b.
Note definetely send all money through your wallet as you can check details there.

This may be a bit late but, Although one could monitor banks and exchanges for people buying and selling large amounts of bitcoins, there are several issues. Namely 
Issue 1, bitcoins are a currency themselves
Issue 2, unlike in banking transactions, large transactions can be carried out without any meaningfull log.
Issue 1 ; If bitcoin establishes itself as a currency people laundering in bitcoins won't need to withdraw or deposit them all to often. Take for example some drug dealers. 
They're expenses buying drugs, there profit selling them.
Instead of having to deal in large amounts of a currency, which would have to be dealt with through either banks or actual cash, both of which could lead to them needing to go on the grid, hence a chance for arrest, bitcoins would allow them to circumvente this to a much greater extent. Say a million people buy 50 usd worth of bitcoins each,  then some  10 percent use it to buy drugs, now our drug dealer has a supply of bitcoins without ever having to go to a bank, If he need to pay his wholesaler he can pay through bitcoins, again without any danger of records in banks, or having to carry around a large pile of money. 
Something comes up and our dealer needs to buy something, he now has two again low risk options, he can either pay in bitcoins, or if usd are needed and exchanges are being monitored, take a flight to any other country without such sanctions, and sell them there.
Although a drug dealer was used as an example this could extend to people attempting to launder money as explained in issue 2.
Issue 2, someone wants to transfer money say a bribe or a bonus. In the case of the bribe they would prefer not to have anything linking it to them. while in the case of the bonus the receiver might not want to pay any tax so would want to avoid declaring it. In either case bitcoins would come in use, as the person selling money could easily create a new anonymous wallet with their funds, and send it to another anonymous wallet owned by the recipient. Then using the methods mentioned in issue 1 they could both withdraw the money. At best all records would show is that person 1 withdrew some money, and person 2 received some, however there would be no evidence showing that it was person 1 who sent the money to person 2. I'm not to familiar with this part and one issue could be that transactions are part of the public block so someone might be able to tell that person a bought 100 bitcoins, sent them to a chain of random wallets and then eventually to a wallet which was tied to person b , but  there would still be simple workarounds. For example person a hires person c for 1 percent of the total. so person a transfers money to account 1 and person c uses account 2 to transfer money to person b. and keeps both accounts separate.

Wouldn't it be cheaper to change it to an alt, transfer it out for pennies, then sell fot bit coins?

Your employer would probably pay the taxes to the government before handing you your paycheck. Also, he would probably report how much he paid you, so you would just have to pay taxes the same way you would if it were dollars. Although it might be harder for the government to seize the taxes in such a situation they could just imprison you for tax evasion if you didn't pay.

It doesn't matter what the us says, the market s much bigger than USA, which has other services like PayPal. Bitcoins biggest markets right now are elsewhere.

I had the same issue a week ago at 135, took out half, so even when the price crashed I had made a 100 percent profit, which is only rising now. Worst case of you selling half you loose 50 percent of potential gains, best anything that happens is still a profit.
Just my reasoning if it helps

Hello, 
The block chain is currently around 14 gigabytes in size, and average transactions per second just cracked one. So (as I understand four years of sub 1 transaction per second = 14 gb),
So will the blockchain remain small when we are at visa transaction levels? (average of 2000 per second)? (going by 7transactions/second = 1mb 2000t/s should = 285 mb right?)
Again I am not too familiar with the small details, so am I making any mistakes here? (e.g. perhaps bitcoins won't directly be used that often, or transactions will somehow be made smaller)
And if my calculations are right, is this acceptable given the current growth rate of storage/data transmission?
Edit; 4 -&gt; 14 gb

BTC-e, Vircurex, and BTC38(it is in Chinese, but Google chrome will auto translate everything you need.)
The major money however comes from finding new smaller exchanges, but these might be scams so you can't often keep more than ten or twenty dollars on these sites.

Actually He would still be semi-rich compared to before buying, its if he buys before a crash, or if value just doesn't go up that he looses money.

Hello, sorry for the late reply, power went for a second and my pc had to restart.
I haven't read the FAQ recently, although after just rereading the point there are still a few things I would appreciate clarification on.
* How difficult is it to double spend? i.e. could it ever grow to rival credit card fraud if bitcoin gains popularity? Could your average computer/television store accept payment without confirmations? 
 * The finney attack mentioned needs a block to be found by the miner, does this mean that now that it is nearly impossible for any single person to mine a block by themselves the finney attack is very unlikely?

I would, but given fees and waiting periods I don't have enough money.
It takes 2 hours to buy move and sell bitcoins from one exchange to another, 2-5 days to move the usd in and out. With my current disposable income it's more lucrative to simply invest in bitcoins, and a few alts.
