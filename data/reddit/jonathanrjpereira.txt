I can display Hash rate and Blocks until mining reward is halfed.  
I'll include the GitHub link once I have tested the electronics out.

Is there a website where I can find a live count of how many are left to be mined?

Cool. I'll try to make a prototype physical counter. I'll update this thread when I make any significant progress.

I'm in here for the long run.

I live in a very humid city near the sea. Things begin to rust if they're not kept in their packaging within a few weeks. But it works fine.

Yup. But many other stats too. It can also be configured to be only a price ticker if you want.

Around a year ago, I came across this [post]( on r/bitcoin that talked about building a Bitcoin Clock across the street from the famous NYC Debt Clock. But instead of counting up like the debt clock, the Bitcoin Clock would count down how many bitcoin remains to be mined. Hence I decided to make this project.
The Tracker web scrapes the data from [ and hence can display several statistics such as: Price, No. of coins mined, No. of coins left to be mined, Blocks until mining reward is halved, Hash Rate, etc in real time.

Feel free to ask me any questions related to the build process. If you're a programmer or engineer and you would like to contribute/add more features/ bug fixes check out the GitHub link above.
Edit: No Pi's we're harmed in the making of this project.

I was inspired to make this project after I came across this post on r/Bitcoin around a year ago:  
**Code:**  [  
**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**  [
In addition to the Number of Bitcoins left to be mined, it can also be configured to display Price, Total Bitcoins ever Produced,  Blocks until mining reward is halved, Difficulty, Hash Rate, etc
The data is extracted by web-scraping the website [ using a Raspberry Pi &amp; displaying the data on a 32x8 Dot LED Matrix display.
If you have any questions related to the build process, let me know in the comments section.

In some cases, a few of my other dev boards don't work properly because of the shorts caused by the salty air.

Because the ticker gets the data from bitcoinblockhalf.com , it can display stats like Bitcoin inflation until next blockhalf event based on current price (USD), Total Blocks, Blocks until mining reward is halved,etc.
