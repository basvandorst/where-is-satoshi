Because maybe they where profitable at some point? Maybe they had hoped it would be profitable, but no one used it? Banks do things like charge for accounts that don't have some minimum balance, or don't have other features associated with them. So seems reasonable that over time some accounts aren't profitable enough to manage.
I don't run a bank, but I'm sure if there is money to be made running a bank full of low value unused accounts, you're welcome to do it.

And I'm not storing my money there out of kindness. Both the bank and I get things out of the interaction.

and it didn't guess corect once.

Ive yet to pay a fee for an atm for a bank I use. It's only to access someone else's ATM.

Yeah, don't pay that either 
@_date: 2019-03-17 23:56:25
Pretty much. Which isn't the worst deal. Plus some banks will reimburse the fees

A data base entery costs money. It costs physical space somewhere. It costs electricity. It costs rent. It costs labor time. It costs computional time. Sure, the individual cost of some number of bytes might be small, but do it for a million or more accounts, and it's likely not trivial.

Also if you want to collect the debts, because no one can seem to afford to pay you back. Safer to just not lend.

If they know how much money was in the machine, they can just reprint the bills.
Bills that are damaged or mutilated are often destroyed and reprinted.
All paper money has a life span, and has to be refreshed.

They did release a bunch of them. Kodak was a behemoth, and selling cameras wasn't a business that would sustain them. Film money dried up faster then their investments in cameras and sensors and other efforts materialized.

In the United States many student loans can't be forgiven. So it's a particularly bad way to raise money to take a risk.
