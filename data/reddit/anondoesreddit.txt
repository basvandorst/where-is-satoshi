$2800 IS MOST LIKE IT
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:56:01
Sell one kidney then at next ATH, buy 3; just in case.

Ya'll don't get bored with the same fucking gif over n over n over again..? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:55:29
$2600 is more like it.

What a shite trader you are 
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:54:01
I make $100 at a minimum via day-trading, daily.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:45:42
Ain't too hard to tell, innit? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:52:57
Once it will stabilise I'll buy few coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:06:26
BTCUSD$4200 IS THE RESISTANCE.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:56:32
Mighty shite decision mate. I bought at the mega dip 2 weeks ago  and I won't buy more unless it drops till 2400!
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:41:46
I usually trade 2 to 3 BTC daily, it's very easy to make $100-200 with that volume.

Quality analysis mate.

Yeah man, Zebpay is for position trading but as a said, I'm a scalper. I make a lot of arbitrage money that's why I have accounts in all 6 Indian exchanges. Belfrics used to be decent, this happened for the first time. Maybe they got greedy... 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:39:28
PLOT TWIST - A TRANNY. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:37:47
Hmm, having my fingers crossed. I will try to get my account verified again and wait it out. I have dealt with Belfrics guys in past and they're decent that's why I took the risk of going all in at their exchange.

Yeah man. Zebpay is trustworthy but the Spread is too wide there. 2.30 buy and 2.10 sell..

More than 12 hours. My account at Belfrics.in shows I have the BTC there but I can't even withdraw it now since its "unverified".

Hey, If you guys use tradingview you must know that you can't edit or remove your calls. And what if i tell you that I called every big move weeks ago there. All my 10 calls were 100% accurate. If you want to check for yourself I'll share the link. I predicted each big move, bullish or bearish few days to weeks ago. Each 100% accurate. 
TA is as much art as it is science. people pay me monthly salaries in BTC to give them market forecast. 
You guys should know better and stop knocking everything off before you try it.

I only regret not buying more at 1800s 
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:03:23
looks like my prediction was spot on! it got tested at 1900 thrice and now battle for $2k begins.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:01:27
What's a bull trap?
