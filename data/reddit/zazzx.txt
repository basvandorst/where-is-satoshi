Because they're not used as currency. Myth?. I'll admit that economics isn't exactly a hard science like physics, but saying deflation doesn't produce job loss and wage erosion is like saying inflation doesn't raise asset prices. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:27:49
I'm going to assume you have no formal education in economics - as often is the case -  apart from what you're friends might spread on Facebook, or what you read on some subreddit once, or some YouTube video you watched. 
You're putting the cart before the horse, as they say. Prices don't adjust to inflation, this is a huge misconception, in fact price movements are inflation/deflation. Inflation is simply an increase in demand for goods and services, it is simply an increase in the aggregate demand within an economy. As more people want a certain good, it's price will overtime rise, simple supply and demand. So what causes an increase in aggregate demand? More money in the masses' pockets, as more people have money to spend the demand for the goods rises and prices adjust to this demand, this is inflation. Wage growth, more jobs, tax cuts, and lower borrowing rates are the major factors that affect aggregate demand, these all lead to inflation. That's why healthy inflation is a good vital sign for the health of an economy. It's why currency speculators will jump on a currency showing higher inflation, they know the central bank will have to raise yields on the currency to keep the economy in check.
Deflation is a decrease in aggregate demand, therefore deflation is a loss of jobs and loss of wages. It's a decrease in economic output.
Right now the USD yields about 3%, that means anyone with savings in the USD can receive a risk free 3%, this rate is rising and is typically around 4-5%. There is absolutely no excuse for losing spending power to inflation.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:18:38
That's a corporate greed problem, not an inflation problem. A hundred years ago it would have been unthinkable for a company CEO to earn more than x10 the average company worker, but nowadays executives get paid million dollar bonuses for doing the least amount of work, while cutting/holding wages to increase profit margins.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:30:47
In the long run you can, and that's what most people do.
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:22:08
You do realize that deflation is one of the worst things for a healthy economy right. Deflation ensures job loss and wage erosion, why the fuck is deflation a selling point if bitcoin's purpose is to act as a currency. 
Edit: To be fair high inflation is equally as bad for an economy. The key is to have a currency that doesn't experience either inflation or deflation(especially deflation). This is why inflation goals are always 0-2% for the year. With the help of better economic theory and practices the USD has become [very stable over the last 40 years.](

Oh no, inflation is robbing us of our purchasing power over the last 100 years... back when the AVERAGE hourly wage was less than a dollar.

How does that money get into the hands of consumers, the Fed isn't going around giving people baskets of money. Think about it...
Most of the Fed's money, 4.5 trillion, is sitting in treasuries and mortgage backed securities (from the 08 liquidity crisis). That money isn't in the consumer's hands. 


No one willingly offers more. Businesses raise prices because they can; the consumer has more money through job growth and wage increases creating a higher optimized price for a business.


People don't value dollars less. This is an important distinction. It's supply and demand as you mentioned, higher demand = higher prices. You can have higher demand even under a fixed money supply, that's why some of the most inflationary periods in US history were under a fixed gold backed money supply.




No. As in a flat earth or gay frogs.
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:06:14
Inflation is not an increase in money supply. Inflation is an increase in the prices of goods and services facilitated by an increase in aggregate demand.
If I can sell a widget for 100$ to 10 people I make 1000$
If I sell that widget for 10$ to 100 people I make 1000$ 
If I sell that widget for 50$ to 50 people I make 2500$
This is called optimization, businesses can't just raise (or drop) prices, they optimize prices to maximize profit.
Now if overtime through an increase in the working population, wage growth, and an increase in population/immigration we get an uptick in aggregate demand, optimal prices for a business/asset will rise.
That widget that I was selling for 50$ now has 60 buyers, I make $3000.
I decide to raise prices to 55$ dropping buyers to 55, I make 3025$.
Prices for goods are always optimized for the aggregate demand for those goods and services.
The only way for a central bank to influence aggregate demand is through interest rates. They can loosen and tighten monetary policy, which impacts the price of debt for banks and ultimately the consumer, allowing the central bank to prevent over growth - economic growth happening too fast isn't good because it causes price instability - or to give the economy some stimulation to help kick up inflation (prevent deflation). Inflation is a vital health sign for an economy, the goal is to keep it 0-2%. There has never been another time in history where [price stability]( has been greater than the last 40 years. No three year period of net deflation since the 30's depression.
Also, realize that inflation still happens under a fixed money supply, and has been much more viscous in the past leading to extreme deflation.


Absolutely laughable. Truly the rise of anti-intellectualism.

Inflation is a function of aggregate demand within an economy. The absolute risk free savings option is currently sitting at 3% and rising. If someone loses spending power it's their own fault for not picking up a risk free 3-5% in treasuries. 
The AVERAGE wage in the US 100 years ago was $1.28, today it's close to $23. Now those same people who don't like to increase wages, imagine the opposite, where they have to cut wages to keep in line with the deflation.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:20:23

First of all "return to the balance sheets" here means bitfinex would pocket the money for themselves at the end of the month, as they don't ever exchange the USD back for tether.
Second, even if bitfinex pumped price through unbacked tether and then sold the pumped up bitcoin for real money to essentially back up the previously printed tether, that would still mean most of the run up to 20k was through artificial demand, and this is still extremely illegal.
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:02:10
It doesn't, but it does other things I value more in a payment system. Like instant free transactions, fraud protection, and world wide acceptance amongst other things. Bitcoin has its niche, but I would much rather pay using Visa and prefer the stability of fiat. Bitcoin isn't a currency; everything is priced in fiat, you can't buy anything priced in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a payment system and a speculative asset, crypto is unique in that regard, but unfortunately it's only good at one of those things.

You are overestimating the usefulness of blockchain tech. Used as a payment system, it's slow, inefficient, and an ecological disaster.

@_date: 2018-06-17 18:50:32


You have a source or did you just pull that out your ass.


The underlying blockchain will still get clogged up, if lighting network causes any meaningful uptick in bitcoin use, the technology can't handle use because it's massively inefficient at a fundamental level.
As a consumer, I want a payment system that is fast, completely free, protects me from fraud/allows transaction reversals, is widely accepted everywhere, and doesn't require me to buy into a volatile, heavily manipulated speculative asset before I can make a purchase for something that's priced in dollars. I don't want to go through an unnecessary middleman to pay for my goods. 
Bitcoin doesn't offer any of these things, LN *may* solve the speed issue, but bitcoin is still no match for something like Visa.

Bitcoin isn't a highly liquid market, it doesn't take much effort, relative to more liquid markets, to push price around. The mtgox trustee sold about 18,000 bitcoin from 20k-6k, assuming average sale price of 13k that's about 234 million USD worth of bitcoin, a very small amount compared to bitcoin's total market cap. Price fell 70% in just a few weeks, granted he wasn't the only one selling, but he was the biggest seller. So selling just 1% of bitcoin's market cap brought the price down 70% because of the lack of liquidity. It's the same for the way up, a couple billion fake dollars injected into the market would skyrocket the price, plus the rising price attracts more speculators which further raises the price creating a positive feedback loop. Without the help of the tether printer bitcoin would most likely still be trading close to $1000 today and probably most of last year.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:15:03


Your falling for the sunk cost fallacy without realizing it. If he sells he has cut a loss. Period. What he does next with that money is up to him. If he believes the best move is to buy back in (at a lower price or higher price) then do that, if he believes the best move is to move into an index fund then do that. The point is that he has removed himself from is losing investment and given himself the option to put his money in a better investment opportunity, that better investment might be bitcoin again.
By holding you're simply saying the best possible position for my money to be in is bitcoin. A losing bitcoin position. Your gambling on bitcoin going up tomorrow and staying up (no rational person would hold if he knew bitcoin will go down in the future), while op is gambling on bitcoin going down tomorrow, no rational person would sell if he thought price would go up. I would much rather be in OP's position and gamble on a lower bitcoin instead of holding and believing today is the bottom over and over (that's essentially what you're saying by holding)
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:51:33
He's right, about bitcoin not being a currency, whether he's a *bitcoiner* or not. Bitcoin is as much a currency as Visa or PayPal, just because a merchant accepts bitcoin doesn't mean the stuff you buy is priced in bitcoin. If the merchant has to adjust prices every time the number of dollars a bitcoin can buy changes, then the currency is dollars not bitcoins. When's the last time you've checked how many euros your dollar buys before making a purchase in USD.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:58:00




This combined with the fact Bitfinex won't exchange tether for USD even though they claim its backed 1:1, plus the fact that Bitfinex hasn't provided a single audit since the inception of tether and continue to refuse an audit, you'd have to be a special kind of stupid to think tether is legitimately backed and wasn't used to pump price. But just keep blindly defending your shitcoin.

I explained how lower prices at the cost of decreased aggregate demand within an economy isn't optimal. The tightening and loosening of monetary policy through central bank interest rates has a direct affect on the prices of goods and services, higher rates and tighter credit means suppressed demand for goods, hence why the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as inflation rises.
You still haven't answered my question, name a single benefit of a currency going through deflation. I say currency going through deflation because there is no such thing as an eternally deflationary currency; even during the gold standard and bimetallic standard, both fixed money standards, there was fluctuations between wild inflation and deflation. These wild fluctuations between inflation and deflation are intrinsic properties of a fixed currency with no protocols to tighten or loosen credit.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:40:00
Bitcoin isn't a currency. Nothing is or ever has been priced in bitcoin, fiat is the currency, bitcoin is the payment system. But bitcoin isn't so good at being a payment system, compared to Visa and company, so it has found its use as a speculative asset instead.

Because they gain financially from pumping price up through tether and then selling those coins for your real USD. Rinse and repeat with a new batch of tether each month.

@_date: 2018-06-12 23:35:27
Obviously no one wants to pay more for goods, but your grossly oversimplifying the relationship between inflation, aggregate demand, and wages. These aren't three separate independent factors, but are heavily connected. The free market can only facilitate inflation in goods and services, businesses raising prices to optimize profit, if the aggregate demand is able to accommodate the higher prices. The important thing to note is that inflation lags aggregate demand within an economy, which ultimately lags wage increases (or alternatively cheap credit). If businesses are forced to reduce prices  to optimize profit, the reason is a reduction in aggregate demand, so deflation is actually a symptom of a weakening economy. When did the US experience the greatest deflation over the last 100 years? It was during the 1930's, definitely not a decade you'd want to live through.

There are things that have intrinsic value outside of their purely supply and demand speculation. Commodities, as you mentioned, are needed for food, energy, and commercial production (even gold). Stocks have intrinsic value because the underlying business produces actual revenue, which is either reinvested by the business or paid out to shareholders as a dividend. Bonds intrinsic value comes from their fixed interest rate and a guaranteed return of your money at maturity. Real estate is a physical asset that can be used to live on, or generate passive income. All of these things have a speculative price, but there is a reason for their existence outside of speculation. Bitcoin is just pure speculation, just a casino. Turds being traded for thousands of dollars, being masked as high tech, when in reality blockchain is low tech and a massive step back compared to modern payment tech. It's a casino for the naive and gullible.

It means if you make less then $36 an hour, it's worth your time to pick up a penny, assuming it only takes one second to do so.

Of course they are. You can shit on fiat all you want, but in the end of the day it's the only measure of value that actually matters.

Venezuela's problems arose from extreme protectionist policies that lead to capital flight and a drop in foreign investment. Hyperinflation is the symptom. Your comment just highlights your lack of knowledge on the subject of economics, but of course in your mind you're an expert in economics. Truly the rise of anti-intellectualism.

Fiat currencies are currency and bitcoin is not a currency, never has been. Goods and services are priced in fiat currency, traders speculate on currencies, but the fact that they are currencies gives them intrinsic value.
Bitcoin isn't a currency, nothing is priced in bitcoin, merchants adjust prices to keep up with how many USD bitcoin can buy, thus USD is the actual currency. 
As you mentioned, bitcoin is a payment system, it does have intrinsic value as a payment system, but it is a horrible payment system. Blockchain is an ecological disaster, massively wasteful, slow, not protected against fraud, expensive when use spikes, dinosaur tech. I want a payment system that is instant, free, easy to use, doesn't require me to keep my money in an unstable speculative asset, and protects me against fraud and theft, something like Visa or PayPal.

A hedge fund *hedges* their bets so their return on average is usually lower than that of a pure equity index like the spy, but they actually take on less risk. This hedged risk allows them to manage massive billion dollar portfolios. Sure you could just stick all that money in the s&amp;p500 and possibly get a larger return, but all your eggs are in one basket and your risking a lot more that way.

What I find funny are the people who come here and say past performance has absolutely zero bearing on future performance, and then proceed to predict price will keep going lower because of the recent trend.

The Fed is audited every year by the Government Accountability Office. It's financial statements are also audited annually by an independent auditor and results are given to the Office of the Inspector General, which then releases the results to the public. 
You can see the 2016 audited financial statements here 
The balance sheet of the Fed is also published every year. Here is the latest:

Liquidity determines stability not market cap. You will have lots of volatility even with a large market cap if the order book is thin.

The problem with your analogy is that a flop of Td5s5c doesn't give you any significant edge in figuring out what the next two cards are likely to be. There is a lot of "bad" TA out there like harmonic patterns and Elliot waves, but technical principles based on mathematics such as regression trends, standard deviations, and moving averages are able to give you a real edge in predicting price direction. The problem with TA critics is that they don't understand random variance and that a positive ev trade doesn't mean it has to work. Most profitable TA based trading strats only achieve about a 50-55% win rate, the key is to manage your risk to reward; cut the losers short when the trade is invalidated and let the winners run-on and grow bigger than your losers when you get the price direction right. Also key is proper money management; dont risk more than 2% of your bank-roll on any one trade idea. The problem is your average joe won't be able to trade TA because they don't have the psychology to apply a slight edge over a long period of time and withstand draw-downs.
The best comparison for proper trading based on sound quantitative mathematical principles is to being a dealer in a game of blackjack. The dealer will always have a slight edge over the player, at least 52% winrate if the player applies proper game theory. To an observer not familiar with the odds the game will look very random, the dealer and player winning almost the same amount of hands, looks like no one has an edge here. We Know of course the dealer will always crush the payer in the long-run.
