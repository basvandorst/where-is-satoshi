In your previous comments you say you buy stuff with bitcoin


On the day-to-day, I'm trying to live as frugally as possible so that I can buy myself more of that sweet BTC.
So I’m confused. Are you holding bitcoin or using it everyday.

Gold has actual value. Because in addition to being valued for its ability to be shiny jewelry, it is used electronics, medical and industrial applications.

So it’s almost purely speculative at this point.  
I can see the utility of bitcoin as a currency, but it can’t become a viable currency until it achieves stability.  When you and I started this conversation, bitcoin was valued at just over $13k. It is currently less than $12k. 
Imagine you sell used cars and sold a car for 1btc yesterday. Whatever profit you made on the sale was washed due to currency volatility.

That’s not true. Apple stock has value because the company turns a profit, has a healthy balance sheet, and for the foreseeable future produces products people want to buy. JCPenney stock is worth for far less and dropping because it is no longer profitable, competitors are crushing and there doesn’t seem to be much of a future for it. When I own a stock I own a portion of that company.  That stock’s value is based on the financial health of the company 
West Texas crude has value because it can be refined into useful products. It’s value it directly related to its availability in relation to its need. 
What is the basis for bitcoin’s current valuation? Why would I want to buy and hold bitcoin?

Going out of business sales are usually held by a third party. The company going out business sells its inventory to a liquidator. Liquidator sells the goods.

That would be the gold standard without the gold.

You save 100% of your net income.  So who are you sponging off of?
