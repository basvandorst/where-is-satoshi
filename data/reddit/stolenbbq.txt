I'm trying to like them, but all I hear is bad reviews. I might wait until there's a new US business to take their place. I know it's "growing pains" but it seems like 1/2 their business model is molasses.

Arr. I wish there was other options in NA. All I hear is horror stories about Coinbase. I figured I'd give them a shot, since I won't be buying a ton of BTC, but now I almost wish I paid the fee and went with BitStamp. If BTC keeps shooting up, I'm missing a lot of gains by waiting for the incredibly slow Coinbase.

Every aspect of coinbase has been under scrutiny lately. For good reason, it seems.

Brand new to BTC. Waiting for Coinbase to charge my bank so I'm able to verify. How does one go about making damn sure this feature is on?

How slow is CB? I am waiting and waiting for them to charge my bank, but it hasn't happened yet. All I want to do is buy some BTC. :'(

How is that terrible advice?
If you think you're able to predict the market, *especially* the Bitcoin market, you're a damn fool. Nobody can. You're nothing more than a two-bit speculator that can't afford milk.

For me, it's verification. I am on my fourth day (est. "2-3 business days") waiting for my bank to be verified. I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and nothing. I don't have to tell this community what I've already lost in this endless waiting game. 
Just a bit annoying to wait 96 (so far) for two small bank deposits. Come on, guys.

Verify my account. It's my understanding that they lock in the BTC price once you order, is that correct?

Hmm OK. Let's hope soon. BTC is shooting up in price!

This should not happen. Get it together, Coinbase. Fuck sakes.

I'm going on my 4th day right now... still no sign from coinbase. It seems like they're having immense growing pains. I can understand that, but it's a bit frustrating when BTC is going up and I can't buy in and in op's case, he can't get out.
