 I was looking to buy bitcoins, and found Instant Bitcoins, when I checked the company, the 3 months old update says "First Gazette" which is a Notice for Voluntary Strike Off and Possible Fraud

Lockspin(UK) Ltd looks legit, and they actually made some money last year   
  
I am wondering if the money came from the bitcoin business

isHappyHalving  = function(a){return true;}

what I meant by 5430s/sec is the minimum you could charge for a minimum slot of time, 1 second  
But nobody stops you to charge 5430 per 10 seconds or per minute. In this case the blockchain transactions would happen less often, which might be a good thing.

the 5430s is a min limit that was introduced by Gavin I think.  
I don't have a whitepaper, it's a simple idea. I am trying to implement it using available APIs for the moment.
