I wonder how the Brothers Chaps feel knowing they, at least in part, helped to inspire something like this.

DO IT!

Why does that have to be a bad thing, though?
What we're doing is publicizing ourselves, not just Dogecoin but crypto in general. You think someone interested in Dogecoin isn't going to hear about and possibly get into Bitcoin, as well? This benefits you, as well as us.
While we're doing that, you guys work on keeping it legal for all the new people hit by the publicity to use crypto. You guys work on ensuring no one gets in any trouble for paying their bills, mining, buying food, anything with crypto.
The way forward isn't slinging mud or hating each other. It's cooperation. It's collaboration. We both play an essential part. No one will use crypto if its legal but they don't know of it, nor will they use it if they're scared of legal action. (Though crypto is inherently infeasible to regulate, but that's another matter entirely.)

I believe they are looking for ethically obtained adult foreskins for research. You could contact them and ask.

That's alright, then. Still, increasing advancements in regenerative technology will result in reversal of male and female genital mutilation that much quicker.

Well, unfortunately, Foregen does suffer from a lack of publicity. If this took off, we could do a lot of good.

It would be so amazing if cryptocurrencies had "proxy wars" (that really just benefited everyone through greater exposure) through competing sponsorships.

Make competing sponsorships! Imagine a guy in Bitcoin shorts and a guy in Dogecoin shorts boxing. Or two entire teams of Basketball players in jerseys of the respective cryptos!
The moon is the limit!
