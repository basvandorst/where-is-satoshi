I couldn't find the friendly gesture, but yeah I'm holding. If I thought about selling I'd have to get out my Ledger, send funds to the exchange, pay a huge fee just to get it there then pay another huge fee to sell. I'll just hodl it out.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:03:30
Good insight, once buying comes back with volume it'll be a huge swing in the other direction.

So you're saying there's a chance?
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:21:44
I bought a tshirt for myself and a sweater for my daughter in 2014 from overstock.com for .22 bitcoin.

I agree, wish we didn't have to pay capital gains on crypto at all. It's just another way to screw us.

Well shtbag, Bitcoin has always been king so today it'll probably remain king. Have a great Sunday!
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:11:56
I wouldn't be surprised if it dips a little more and then bakkt news comes out that they are launching soon and we shoot over 10k.
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:33:29
Seems probable to me. Everyone knows about the CME gap at $7500 so once it gets filled I bet everyone will jump back in.

It was amazing. Thank you
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:24:16
They say bitcoin makes most of it's gains in only about 11 days a year or something, but yeah this is a big move because of big news.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:40:52
Yeah that's crazy. It kind of forces me to be a hodler. After 1 year of not selling the tax rate drops a bunch I believe.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:28:07
On Gemini you can set buys for any repeating time period you want and the dollar amount. It's really easy with the phone app.
@_date: 2019-02-12 08:13:50
I'm pretty sure there was news the other day that showed that a lot of Mt Gox coins were sold onto the market starting in Dec of 2017 and all the way through 2018 which is what caused the steep decline in price. And I think the 2 guys that did it are done selling now so that should be bullish. That's a short summarization from my bad memory but you could look it up. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:19:46
I moved .19 bitcoin to an exchange from my ledger and the ledger put the rest of my bitcoin into a different wallet address. I had been checking the one wallet address on my phone for months just to make sure it's there but then it showed 0 bitcoin so I was freaking out for about 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:42:37
I've chatted with a couple guys that have recovered their wallets after a reformat and they said there is a program called pywallet that is specifically made to recover bitcoin, litecoin ect private keys. They say it can be up to 90% gone and the program will figure it out. I'll know if anything is left within 25 minutes of a drive scan.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:45:43
I have app on my phone called "coin market app" and it has a portfolio section where you can put in all of your buy and sells and it makes it easy to see your average costs and profits. It only updates once every couple minutes though.
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:09:17
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:02:49
Lol well done
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:57:25
Yes, I bought @ $6500 in November the day before the big dip under 6500. I kept buying about once a week and I bought a good chunk at $3239. I was down for a few months and it was crappy feeling but I knew it would turn around eventually. Even though I'm in good profit now it still sucks to see it go down, but I'm about 95% sure we'll see 20k again and new all time highs, it's just going to take some time.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:41:28
Did you hold through all That?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:49:15
If McAfee is right and bitcoin goes to 500k in 3 years and Ethereum goes to 200k than yeah Ether is a way better buy at the current prices. I'm not saying he's going to be right but it is just a thought to consider that he could be right.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:03:58

Wow, that guy has done his homework on Bitcoin and he gets it. Those were some awesome answers he gave Joe.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:08:38
And BCH is crashing so it could be that those buyers will move to BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:31:44
I know, I had them back in 2009 before I even knew what bitcoins were. I won them from a online casino and I downloaded the full bitcoin wallet and had them in there. I'm getting the laptop back from my sister's friend at thanksgiving and I'm hoping there is a way to recover my wallet's private keys and restore the bitcoins. I know it's surely been written over but it's worth a shot.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:26:50
That's kind of how I'm looking at it, if i had access to those bitcoins since 2009 I probably would have sold them when it got to $20 or lost them in the mt. Gox debacle.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:23:33
1028 of them got lost on my old laptop that I gave to my sister, so there's that.

I lost an entire bitcoin on feebitcoin.io or whatever a few months back by playing the stupid high low game. I setup an auto playing thing that was working great for hours at a time but when I wasn't looking it got like 30 negative rolls in row and wiped me out. I was soooo pissed and I still am about it. I'd stay way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:47:16
I just sent .48 bitcoin and it costed 0.0015825 BTC or $11.50, seems like a lot to me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:23:24
Meh? Or Meh!

I'm never naming my child Rog.. after that A hole. I just wonder if he really believes his bs? He already made millions in bitcoin but the greedy bastird has to scam innocent people of their hard working money? Screw BCH and that guy, long live bitcoin! To the moon.
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:18:58
I'd say you're wrong.

Lol. You were getting close to the moon though. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:01:01
That would put litecoin's market cap @ 60.5 Billion,
What do you think Bitcoin's market cap would be then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:21:46
I didn't know that the laptop was still accessible until a few weeks ago, my sister told me she gave it to her friend who she still talks to. I told my sister a couple years ago that the laptop could be worth $700k but she said she didn't have it anymore and I really didn't ask anymore questions then. I guess there is a program called "pywallet" that can recover your private keys even if it's been written over 70 to 80%. I'll know within 25 minutes of a scan of the drive if there's anything left of my private keys. My sister got the laptop back a week ago but haven't had time to drive a couple hundred miles to get it yet. 
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:19:16
I'm thinking that's what's going to happen. I bought last December and I'm still holding. I sold a little at $10,500 but still holding the rest.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:52:47
Oh yeah I'm great at that. Might need to source a new alphabay before hand though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:49
God here, yes those extra bitcoins were sent to test your honesty, if you would dm me I'll send a address for you  to send the extra bitcoins to. This is a test in your faith in me, if you fail I'll smite down on your cat with tremendous furry. Ok good luck on your test.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:45:53
I just sold and I want in again now but LOW as well. This might sound crazy but could you DM me when you think it's time to get back in? Doesn't hurt to ask right.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:11:05
This is me, I'm dealing with two broke down cars right now but I'm getting my laptop back from my sister's friend that at one point had 1028 bitcoins on it from 2009. I'm hoping for a miracle to recover my wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:51:49
How and where?
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:27:19
It looks like we're heading down over the next few days and there's a big support right now around 7k. If we bounce and get through some of the moving averages with authority then we continue higher, but if we bounce and fall back at 7k we could go a little lower. I don't want to bet my house on it, but that's what I see happening. 7500 Bottom would be fine with me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:57:15
Yeah I agree with you it's nuts. I just wasn't sure if you were being sarcastic somehow because when I looked on your transaction link it didn't show how much the fee was.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:52:22
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:28:12
Switch to Gemini. That $100 purchase would only cost about $.40 and they don't have any withdrawal fees for the first 30 withdrawals in a month. I just bought $1200 worth of bitcoin on Gemini and the fee was $3.00, if that was on coinbase the fee would have been like $30.00.
 Gemini is way better, but they don't have a nice trading platform like gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:31:03

I honestly think the real creator of bitcoin died years ago after struggling with ALS. Most of you have probably seen that video that came out a few years ago and it made sence that the real Satoshi quit posting while the guy they pointed out in the video was dealing with ALS.

@_date: 2019-01-06 09:38:58
The VanEck ETF decision day is Feb. 27th so I'd think Bitcoin's price should see a little upside between now  and then. And if it's rejected it'll probably dump pretty hard. Bakkt should be up and running by then so I don't know if that'll smooth price action out at all or make it even more volatile?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:36:53
I started buying again two weeks ago right before the first big crash. I saw the wedge on the chart and thought it might break to the upside. I bought at $6500, then $5500 then $4300 two times. I'm down a lot right now and kind of scared to look at how much. 
I'm still tempted to buy more if it goes lower. I bought some ether to. Just bad timing dang it.
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:21:54
A couple years ago there was a website that you could start your own cryptocurrency for $5.00. You could pick how many coins there'd be, when the halving ect. I think there are some free ones now to. Bitcoin's advantage is it's network's size, the more people who run nodes and mine around the world the more secure the network is. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:54:58
Nice. They know what's up.
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:53:53
Lol, nice work. Any idea if Grin will be on Binance?
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:04:59
I think we'll be fine. It won't matter much when the price shoots back up.
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:28:22
At today's prices that's worth $47,050. Bitcoin is saying hold my beer.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:49:55
Ok that answers my question. Thanks
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:49:14
That's a very good read and very bullish for bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:54:35
I bought that book to but haven't read it yet. I think some investors are a little worried about those hard forks creating new coins though. And then there's a fork of fork. All of those forks are making the hard money element look soft to some people.
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:24:17
Are people still using bitcoin for dark web stuff? I thought those sites all got closed down?
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:48:07
That's all true. As long as the nodes and miners keep supporting the main chain they keep bitcoin strong and secure. Thanks for detailed reply. This explanation will need to be passed onto big investors for them to understand it better. Long Live Bitcoin!!

Don't worry about bitcoin halvening, it's not happening for over a year. Bakkt did get delayed but it's still coming soon supposedly so don't worry about that. There's a lot of good news for Bitcoin recently and with it already being so low lots of people are expecting the price to rise in the the coming weeks / months. Leading up to the halvening has always caused the price to rise in the past so most people will be expecting the same thing this time.
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:45:10
That's good news. Moon soon?

I had a laptop that I gave to my sister back in 2010 because she said she needed one. It Had 1028 bitcoins on it that I won from a online casino in 2009, and I reformatted the hard drive before I gave it to her. I told her about the bitcoins a week ago and and she said she gave the laptop to her friend a few years ago and that she still has it. I doubt I'll be able to recover my wallet but I'm getting the laptop back and I'm going to try using a program called "pywallet" to recover the private keys. 
 The fact that I can still get the laptop back is a good sign to me. 
 Good luck getting yours back but without the private keys I think it's impossible.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:18:06
Good point.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:59:09
That's awesome. I put 1 Btc on a usb drive that I bought at the very peak of 2013 at around $1050 and gave it to my daughter for her birthday. We then watched the price keep falling for awhile and she wanted to sell it and buy other stuff so I sold it at around $670 and gave her the money. And now I kick myself for not making her keep it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:40:24
Good read, I didn't know the Philippines accepted it as legal tender so that's good to hear. The more countries accepting bitcoin the better and it'll just increase the price significantly. I have to load up more.

Great Job holding all this time even through the low times, and great move getting ethereum so early to. You're set for life if you keep holding for awhile longer. If I were you I'd keep at least 20 bitcoins and 100 ethereum for the very long haul like 10 + years. You basically hit the lotto twice.

Ethereum is a platform for businesses to use the blockchain for all kinds of secure and verifiable transactions. New games coming out are already building apps on ethereum, there are many ideas that people way smarter than us are working on that will be built on the ethereum network. I get that it won't be a limited supply like bitcoin which makes bitcoin able to have a very higher price potentially, but there will be thousands of companies using the ethereum network and all transactions will have a very small fee to operate  which will drive the price up. I think ethereum's market cap will eventually surpass bitcoin's but the price per token might not. Also when ethereum goes to POS holders of 10 or more tokens will earn interest which will further increase the demand for it and increase the price. Ethereum isn't trying to compete with bitcoin, it's just leaping from the shoulders of bitcoin in a different direction.
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:08:13
I have a GTX 1070 and a 4790k computer. You can very well just use nicehash and get a little bitcoin that does add up over time. I use the GPU to mine ethereum on nanopool and I use the CPU to mine on Nicehash. You'll have to do some steps to get everything working good but your CPU will kick ass on Nicehash. My 1070 earns about .05 ethereum a week at 32 m/hs. I got MSI afterburner overclocked the memory and under clocked the core, also set power to 60% so save on electricity. 
Nice setup by the way.

Gemini is a lot cheaper with fees. I've been with coinbase for years but those fees always bugged me. I just signed up with Gemini last week and I bought $420 worth of bitcoin yesterday and the fee was only like $1.05 on coinbase it would have been $6.25
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:46:01
Nice, I just signed up with Gemini last week after being with coinbase for years. Gemini says the first 30 withdrawals per month are free so that's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:32:09
Congrats, that's a very nice accomplishment at that age. I've been telling my daughter about bitcoin for the past 4 years but I can't get her interested in it and now she's 18.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:40:53
How many bitcoins did it make for you?
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:04:59
It's a way to trade stocks that support bitcoin. It'd be a way for people to invest in bitcoin but instead of buying bitcoin directly they'd be owning shares of stock that represent a certain amount of bitcoin. It's been turned down 5 or 6 times already but if it goes through bitcoin will Moon because lots of people will be investing the traditional way with bitcoin. It'd support 401'ks ect. So lots of money would be thrown at bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:34:24
Yeah it frustrates me to, and the fact that she just gave it way without even asking if I wanted it back. I told her a couple years ago when bitcoin was around $700 that those bitcoins were worth $700k and she just said that she gave it way then but didn't tell me that she knew where it was at. I should have got on it back then.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:50:58
I watched a documentary about bitcoin and I forget the guy's name but I think the real guy got ALS and used the name Satoshi Nakamoto because it was his neighbors name. He never wanted to be known.

I bought in November at $6500 the day before it dropped a lot. I kept holding and it took about 5 months to get back to even. So I feel your pain but you should be ok in time.

He sounds like a smart guy, now lets hope he's right.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:19:46
I'd bet it's worth 10x what it is now. It's growing in recognition and usage every day while it's also becoming more rare from lost wallets deaths ect.

If you don't think ethereum has a good future you're a dumb ass. I've done my research but I'm not going to try to change you're weak little mind.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:49:50
If Bitcoin is going to a million dollars sometime in the future, it sure does look cheap right now.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:45:00
So Bakkt is open for institutions and Bitcoin's price is dropping. I bet institutions will slowly start accumulating and eventually the price will start rising and somewhere near a new all time high they will open Bakkt for the general public. That's my guess and I think it'll take some time.

Good info. I'm going to try this soon with an OLD laptop that I had between 754 and 1028 bitcoins on it in September of 2009. I just found out that my sister gave it to her friend a couple years ago and she still has it. I know it's a slim chance of getting the .dat file recovered after all these years but it's worth a shot. It did have the entire blockchain on from back then so it'll be interesting to see if I can get anything off of it.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:06:06
Lol sorry
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:54:33
I saw that to, looks like we're heading back up to $7k though.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:24:40
I just took a little profit, my average buy is at 4250 for bitcoin and 140 for eth. I've kicked myself before for never taking any profits, and just looking at the Bitcoin chart to me it looks like it'll come down in the next couple days.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:23:03
Good job, I got a buy on Gemini at $7079.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:18:45
Yes, a couple months ago I was watching ether and fell asleep while it was at $160, when I woke up in the morning with a bad hangover it was at $140 and I felt robbed.

Does Japan trade in Futures? Bitcoin is world wide so I'm not worried about what our little part of the world says about it. It's going to take some upward price movement to reverse the futures but they'll get on board eventually. From what I saw on the gold chart they introduced futures at its peak and then ETFS at the bottom which drove the price way up. Maybe a ETF will get approval while we're here at the bottom like Gold.
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:08:47
Ok keep looking. Hope you find a good one.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:32:51
Something I've learned through research about the 2018 bear market, Mt Gox coins were sold starting in January 2018 and they were sold at every attempt at a recovery and at the big drop in November. Court records showed the sale of thousands of bitcoins at the corresponding dates of the large drops in prices. They were sold to repay mt Gox investors from the 2013 hack. The investors  will  be paid in fiat, not Bitcoin. Since these coins aren't being sold anymore for the foreseeable future, this is why I believe bitcoin is having a chance to recover.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:30:07
Me to. Just did again 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:36:11
I've lost 10k in the past 3 weeks, I started buying literally the day before the first big crash. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:55:19
Yeah that's completely nuts! And he has probably made a killing shorting bitcoin from the all time high. 
I'm just sick of him making a killing off of the Bitcoin brand name and trying to convince people BCH is the real bitcoin. Every time he talks he bashes BTC and promotes BCH.
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:57:46
At the time that article was written Bitcoin was $9979 so it wasn't written recently, but other than that it's a good explanation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:43:12
Ok, that makes sense. I hope the Tether stuff was just fud.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:06:34
At some point it'll turn around, a little buying pressure could trigger a massive short squeeze soon.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:36:33
But now we have the Bitfinex and Tether scandal going on which could be another Mt Gox scale tragedy about to happen. Which might be why the price is pumping so hard, so they can cash out while the price tumbles.

Who's ready for another Big Green Dildo? I know I am.

Good read. Bitcoin is a worldwide currency and the world is coming to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:40:14
I'm saving some USD incase bitcoin drops more but I don't think it'll be dropping lower than $3750 anytime soon. The last couple times it got down there it shot up faster than I could walk across the house to get on a PC. It seems to me there are whales sitting there and they are forcing shorts to cover fast. But if it ever does go lower I'll be ready to grab more.
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:21:14
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:38:07
It doesn't have to be on the 3rd, it's supposed to be by the 3rd. The theory is that exchanges are using our bitcoins to lend to shorters to short Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:04:04
That's weird, cool, and funny all together. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:31:19
I need some pain killers for this blood bath. I could see a commercial for pain killers that accepts Bitcoin, would probably do really good.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:12:37
I'd be happy if 1 Satoshi equaled 1 cent, but a dollar ok.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:23:55
Yep that's exactly what happened with my last six purchases. Oh what a feeling.
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:14:40
HODL doesn't mean sell! Ok I tried 
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:55:51
Yeah 10% is pretty high. I switched to Gemini a couple years ago and I think it's 1% plus no withdrawal fees for the first 25 withdrawals each month. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:48:48
These tweets from money managers will be more impactful on Bitcoin's price once Bakkt is up and running. It'll make it easier for common folk to call their investment broker and tell them to buy Bitcoin because they saw a positive tweet about Bitcoin. It's coming and I think smart money is loading up now. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:49:44
Bitcoin's price is going in the wrong direction, Bitcoin needs a pep talk, you're better than this Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:59:28
This is crazy! I sold 0.102 Bitcoin and a Few ethereum, but I couldn't talk myself into selling it all even though I'm expecting the top to blow off soon.

When there's blood on the sheets, buy new sheets, when there's blood in the streets buy Bitcoin.

I've heard blockchain is owned by Roger Ver and it's a scam. I heard the same thing happened to another person a couple years ago. When I visited the site last week on my phone Google wouldn't let me view the site because of security reasons. Don't use Blockchain.com
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:46:17
Not bad... A for effort.

For the 330th time Bitcoin isn't dead. Some alts are dying though and they're trying bring Bitcoin with them. It's like the black plague going around but Bitcoin has a strong immune system. Everyone thinks Bitcoin is infected with the plague to but it's not, it's just a virus that will soon pass.

@_date: 2018-12-06 10:48:49
The scam coins are exiting the space right now and dragging the price down and people know it so that's why there's so many shorters right now IMO.
I think it'll start going up in January and then I think mid year to the end of the year next year it'll grab more traction because of the upcoming halving. The US futures contracts might hold it down for awhile but Bitcoin is global and eventually it'll start rising and the futures will change direction and it'll help Bitcoin keep rising. 
 I'm not worried about buying at these levels because I don't think it'll be down here for too long.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:53:01
That's what's happening right now, and there the fact that we're bouncing off of the 200 week moving average it's creating a major bullish move. I watched massive shorts get liquidated at the very beginning of this move, I saw a 3.3 million dollar short get liquidated.

Back in the day I paid $2800 for a butterfly labs 60 ghs asic miner and was making about 0.0241 btc at first but it soon dropped to 0.0124 a day and I sold the miner for a huge loss. Today that miner is completely worthless.

Every day bitcoin adoption is growing world wide from poor 3rd world countries to the big hedge funds all over. The bitcoin network is getting better and faster all the time now. It's just a matter of time for a ETF approval and bitcoin will literally go to the moon. We're lucky to be able to catch these low prices and accumulate IMO.

 I did watch a movie about silk road a couple years ago that covered a lot of what she said but I don't remember the name of it. I don't think the movie covered how our agents were actually doing crimes to behind the scenes.

Does anyone remember that supposedly private email of Roger Ver's about 11 months ago that said he was going to be working with Bitfinex to short Bitcoin until it goes to $1000 or less? Everyone said it would never happen but we are way closer to that now. I'm pretty sick of Roger and his greedy selfish ideas. Do you guys think BCH ABC and sv are selling off and causing this constant drop?

No problem, my daily limit on Gemini is $2500 but was only $500 for about 6 months I think. I bought $2500 worth last week and the fee was $25.
