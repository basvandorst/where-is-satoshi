No simple man says he is simple. The man who says he is a simple man is then not a simple man at all.

I see you've said this a few times in this thread already. I'm confused by your logic because according to it, if crypto currency  has the chance of getting supplanted by crypto currency  then no investor should invest in neither   nor any other crypto currency because it could always just get replaced and thus lose its value. 
Each time the top crypto currency gets replaced, it gets harder for that new top dog currency to get replaced, since it must be better than the one it replaces. (So it's harder for  to replace  than it is for  to replace 
Say  is nearly perfect; it has only one "flaw" which  doesn't have, thus making it "perfect". Obviously  would replace  It couldn't get replaced by anything better because it is perfect. 
So relating this to your example: if bitcoin, which you mentioned is your idea of near perfect money, was replaced by another crypto currency, that replacement would *have* to be "better." If Bitcoin is so great and it got replaced by something *better* I would think it rational to invest in that.

Hey so this sounds great and I read as much as I can about it (don't know C no one has asked this: what fees are associated with this, specifically the autobuy feature?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:44:14
