Swearing is a sign of intelligence and honesty. It’s been studied.

Just a typical bitcoin bullrun with overbuys and corrections and fomo.

Because going faster that 2-2.5 x the 200 day moving average is asking too much of a bull run. Even for Bitcoin. Chill out we are still in a long term bull. As for Eth, well you shouldn’t store value there anyway.

My plan is to sell on the way up starting at 70k until hopefully between 90-150k whenever the Mayer is over 2.5 then buying back in at 50k in 2023.
So Between 90-150k

Are they saying National Security so they have a reason to bypass the first amendment?

Somebody has some heavy shitcoin bags.

I use Coinbase pro as my BTC checking account. That way I have to replenish what I spend, and I don’t have to pay fees to move to my wallet and then to the merchant, saving double fees.

I didn’t think it was possible for anyone, even the president, to bypass the first amendment.  Cryptography is considered speech in court rulings. You could probably argue that money is speech as well.
He could really make it difficult to buy and use as currency though. But that shouldn’t effect sov usecase much especially worldwide.
