I don't usually down-vote, but for you I'll make an exception.

Maybe tell us something we don't already know?

When you say "Could governments" you mean to ask can all major gov. work together in a reasonable fashion to make and enforce a law they think is good? If so, then the answer is no. Has nothing to do with crypto, they just can't do shit together.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:36:51
Ah. Also no. The only thing gov. can efficiently do today is limit access to the traditional banking system. I can trade via VPN, encrypted channels, and if needed, we can even use "hidden in plain sight" methods (I send a meme, looks like any jpg file, unless you know how to extract the encrypted data in it). Same thing with home (small scale) mining or even solar-powered mining. All you need is a small encrypted channel and no obviously large electric bill.
Countries with weak privacy rights can probably do a bit better, but they are also more corrupt, which makes for different opportunities.

To be honest, there are many ways to (legally) capitalize crypto gains. Israeli banks make random branch-based decisions with little or no central guidance. If you bring your funds through Israeli exchanges (one real exchange with low volume and one that buys and sells for you but takes a 5% cut) - no problems in most cases. If you do it by selling to a local (OTC, one of the exchanges handles that as well for big volumes) - no problem. If you bring it from a known international exchange - maybe yes, maybe no, no rules here.
The problem isn't with crypto, Israeli banks are now extra paranoid after getting huge fines from the Americans, for helping with tax evasions. Rather than just not doing that, they make you run in circles for every international transaction by private people. When adoption will happen, they will be glad to take your money, hopefully by then you won't have to use them.

That is really stupid. Unlike bitcoin (or gold), there is no set amount of fiat in any major economy today. Phrases like "current currency supply of the United States ($3.3 trillion)" don't really mean anything. The fiat world, via fractional banking, mandatory reserves, quantitative easing etc' made it impossible to track how much money there really is. Wikipedia lists 6 empirical measures of money.  Is it 3.8T (M1 USD) or 14T (M2)? Or maybe M3, that the fed no longer publishes?
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:50:59
You got this wrong. BTC is up because the fed did not go with a 0.5% decrease, but only with 0.25%.
This is the bubble game, and the fed just said they are going to play slower. It will devalue fiat, make some people very rich and many very poor. Trump wants the recession after the election. This signals that the fed, while playing the game, may not be willing to throw the economy under the bus for a few more months of good stock prices.

One solution (already implemented in a crypto-&gt;cash exchange, forgot the name) is both parties deposit funds into a smart contract. If the buyer receives the goods, he frees up the payment and he and gets his deposit back (sender gets his deposit + payment). If it's a scam, he burns the whole thing down, and both sided lose money. No point in scamming if it costs you money.

But we all know in practice this is not the case. When a big company buys a large share of another company, the price is rarely the stock price, the other way around, the stock price adjusts when the sale price becomes known (and I'm not talking about mergers, that may have a synergistic effect).
If Bezos wants out, negotiating with Berkshire is definitely a good strategy, but dumping it on the market and assuming Berkshire will just buy at is not. Berkshire, by the way, often buys large chunks at companies at terms not available to small investors. 
Last thing about "efficient markets" - how can someone seriously claim the market reflects real value when even big companies change swing 30% back and forth in a few months without any significant change to their fundamentals ?
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:12:50
Amazon is worth \~940B, that doesn't mean Bezos can sell his \~100B in a day, or probably even a year, without cutting the price significantly. 
Value is always calculated by multiplying the price of one unit by the number of units. This is a much closer estimate of true value (whatever that may mean) for something as liquid and dividable as bitcoin.

No, this was the actual (obvious error) display, and both from the mobile and the desktop. After refreshing it went away, came back and went away again.

Bitcoin has an issuance rate of 4%, the relation between issuance (how much more supply) and inflation (how price of products changes) is complicated (percent wise, the trend is clear). For example, in the past 10 years, the amount of USD (for example M2) approximately doubled, but inflation is not reported as 100%. 
Moreover, some countries (like the US) cheat on the inflation figures, by calculating it not as changes in prices, but amount of money needed for the same life standard, thus removing and technological advance (this is done to save the gov. money, by devaluing some entitlements). This accounts for about an extra 1.5% per year if memory serves me right\*.
\*This may sound like a conspiracy theory, it is actually not a secret, and even mentioned briefly in the wikipedia of CPI.

If you're not afraid of the blockchain space (sounds like it), you can hold some of your cash as an Ethereum stablecoin like DAI, and get \~10% APR lending it on compound (on chain smart contract, but not completely trustless, as the team still holds the contract keys for upgrading and security \[they say it is temporary, but still some risk\]).
1% is a bit low, 5-10% per investment means that if you're 50% BTC, you need 5-10 good investment opportunities, not the easiest thing today.
US bonds may be attractive now, if you buy at a yield of \~1.9% and it goes to zero like Europe, the price of the bonds will go up. 
Not an investment advise, just a guy sharing his thoughts.
P.S. heard stories that some channels censor comments about other coins, this isn't the case here, it it? ;-)

No one will call you antisemitic if you respectfully give a hate-free, fact based opinion.
Iran is a country that in addition to striving for nuclear weapons, is actively waging a proxy-war on Israel by supporting terrorist organizations. The US and all of its middle east allies would like Iran not to have that capability. You can think that the US control over the world financial system is problematic, as is its use as a weapon. I'll even agree with you on that. No laws prohibit you from speaking the truth (unless your name is Assange).
The nice thing about Bitcion, none of this makes and difference.

Not at all. HF are standard in Ethereum (to avoid tech stalling, the network will, by design, slow down to a halt without a HF) and having the coins in your own wallet prior is the safest way to make sure you get both coins in case of a fork (not likely this time).
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:03:22
If every French person tried to do this, the Bitcoin network will stall, fees will become too high. Need more base scaling (and L2 solutions).
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:53:05
I've recently suggested something similar for Ethereum ([ I think it could be  a good global crypto event, helping to reveal scams and retake sovereignty. The date for Eth is Jan 16th (next HF), but I think there is a big advantage if it all goes together.

I don't only own, I also use it (Augur for me, others have other uses).
