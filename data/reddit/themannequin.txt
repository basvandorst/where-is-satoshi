Unless we can simultaneously thwart greedy capitalism and corporatism, bitcoin will never realise it's potential. If our economy does not see some serious changes first something will fuck it all up.

I dont understand how news regarding the legal status of a prominent bitcoin supporter is off-topic in bitcoin discussion.
Even if you don't like him, he's pushing a big agenda relevant to the future of bitcoin.

I used the word "prominent" which you conveniently ignored.

Me too. What does this mean, I haven't looked into it? Are deposits into coinbase USD instant?

Lol enable is a strong word. You really can't enable a drug addict, they enable themselves after a point. You can give an addict money, but if you dont they're going to find it somewhere. You can give them a convenient dealer but there's always a backup. Ross helped make the game safer, that's all. The true addicts buying from SR didn't become addicts because of SR, shipping times don't allow for that.
A lot could be said about the quality of family that raised the typical drug addict, also. I don't feel bad for the parents of most addicts I've known because most of the time their parents led or neglected them down that road.
I guess I'm trying to say something about not making assumptions. As an ex junkie, I'm feel I'm qualified to make presumptions. They could easily just be bullshit, though.

45 years? We just celebrated 100 years since the first passed ban, which was heavily racially motivated, on opium and coca products in the US. Let's not forget where most of these drug bans came from. The drug war carries a lot of history of prejuduce and racial exploitation.

"with you druggies"
You're a real treat. You know nothing at all about me and you're making examples out of absolutely nothing.
If you wanna believe that you've got a friend in the government, that they're always there to protect your own best interests and that what they say is irrevocable truth, fine.
That seems a little like a fantasy world to me.
I'm facing ugly reality. In the real world, people, especially politicians and state officials, are dishonest and deceitful. Thats on you if you can't see it.
Maybe this judge is right and maybe Ross attempted murder. That doesn't mean that the DEA and their task forces are all fucking shining diamonds. 
Corruption exists everywhere, and that's reality.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:42:27
Of course, but this isn't a criminal trial. I thought we were discussing the morality of the issue and whether Ross should be supported and defended. The laws are too numerous and broken, they'll work whichever way best serves against him. He is guilty, 100%, of breaking the law. There's no arguing that.
On a legal platform, though, attempted murder accusations aside, is providing a safe environment  for illegal activity as heinous as the activity itself? They're trying and publicizing him like a cartel leader when all he seems to have done was act as a middle man on a site he made that eventually got too big for his control (and perhaps ego). Should he be punished like a kingpin? He will, probably, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to be making an example of some drug abusing tech geek who earned a meager sum (in context to the cartels) while actual drug cartels are murdering, enslaving and ripping people off every second of the day.
As far as I know, and as far as the DEA knows, Ross is far from that. He's helped protect people from dangers like that, he's helped undermine organized crime (despite the fact that all drug sales profit cartels) by giving people an alternative to meeting gangs and their lackeys, by slowing down local drug trade it keeps the issues further up the chain, further away from home.
The impact wasn't large, I'm sure, but it was an important stand to make.

I'm of the belief that drug use shouldn't be any concern at all of the government's. I don't believe Ross or SR have done anything wrong, except getting caught.
Bitcoin has done wonders in undermining laws that are only kept in place because of the profitability of incarcerations.
You think drugs are bad? How about the police who throw teenagers in jail over a gram of pot? What about the imprisoned heroin addicts who needed rehab, psychiatry, help, etc. but were instead locked away. Who are the bad guys, really? Freedom of bodily choice vs a cold metal cage... This is far from black and white and Ross is definitely not to blame for any crimes committed.
Shit, the fact that people didn't have to go out and meet strange, potentially dangerous people because of his website practically makes him a hero. He's provided a level of harm reduction that hasn't been seen since clinics started giving junkies sterile water and clean utensils.
There were a lot of road bumps, but I honestly think what SR did with BTC was nothing but positive. Drugs are desired and will never go away, so all we have is harm reduction until we can bend these laws to actually get those addicted the help they need.

By "echo chamber" do you mean "people I disagree with?"
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:19:50
True, and I was going to mention counterfeits and elaborate but I got lost in a rant somewhere.
I don't have a defense for fraud, counterfeits, etc. Their sale was simply one of the road bumps that maybe should not have been allowed, as it causes direct harm to government procedures and adds additional stigma to something that could've been more.
Still, they explicatatly banned illegal pornography, they're not without all moral.
For the most part, it was drugs. Some large guns got through, but as far as I remember seeing (I'll admit curiosity piqued me) it was mostly gun show or flea market grade rifles, knives and brass knuckles.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:33:47
1 month of drug rehab and 6 months of out-patient treatment and probation are cheaper than mandatory minimum incarceration nearly 100% of the time. That's all I have to dignify your completely out of touch response with. Not that I blame you for being out of touch with something as awful as drug addiction.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:04:56
Libertarians are certainly not people I like to associate with.
I like BTC for its globalized, instantaneous use, first and foremost.
I just don't think Ross tried to have anyone killed.
I'm also aware that the DEA tends to bend the truth when pushing for a vital conviction.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:19:08
Please read further for some examples of me engaging people who argue otherwise.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:43:16
It has nothing to do with media bias, but everything to do with believing the word of a corrupt drug inforcement agency that has proved again and again they'll do or lie about whatever necessary to make a conviction, to make an example.
Ross is a big fish, and they don't want to lose him. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:15:36
Silk road didn't sell anything, first of all. The vendors did. That still doesn't make it legal, of course. The point is "should it be illegal?"
Consider that all of the weapons sold on SR are also obtainable at any gun show, auction or flea market and they did not allow the sale of illegal pornography.
Again, this is not black and white. There is a lot of pull on the good/bad scale of SR, but as a whole the concept was necessary and beneficial, to BTC and to the safety and privacy of struggling addicts.
Edit: I am now aware military grade weapons were sold, despite their gun restrictions, but I believe weapons were removed? I don't know, and don't care to do more research. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:11:18
Again, I'm not arguing whether not Ross legally deserves punishment. I've never once implied that, in fact I said again that "I believe that Ross.." and I said elsewhere something like "Ross is 100% guilty." 
I can't criticize laws that are in place as they're acting out around me, because that's just how law works and I have to accept it? At least until I can change it, according to you, which I can't do if I can't criticize it.
You're trying to put me into a loop. That's unacceptable.

Ok, your depiction of him is fair. He's nobody special, nobody worth praising, he just figured out a loophole and any good that came was likely a result of more juvenile intent.
Still, the effects are there. Serious or not, taking money out of street dealers hands is a good thing. It cuts back on gangs at home and gives them less incentive to keep selling the stuff. I don't know how organized drug gangs really work, but it seems to me like the more money thats flying above their heads, back to the source, the better to divert crime at a street level, where the most obvious crimes take place. The drugs are sent through the mail, a large part of the way that would otherwise occupy the time of the abused drug mules (paid and feared into taking the fall if caught) who transport the stuff across boarders.
It helps keep the crime of it all behind closed doors. Most drug organizations glorify drug dealers and hustlers, this undermines that. It keeps addicts, essentially slaves to a product, away from their unpredictable gangster salespeople who depend on their continued problems, who would enhance their problems.
Two grey faces hundreds/thousands of miles apart eliminates that attachment. Addicts can use other sellers, like on eBay, they don't have to put up with the scumbag because he's got them on a leash. Because he's the only one who's got their medicine and they'll meet whenever, wherever and under whatever conditions or prices that he demands.
A lot of this whole argument arises because of stigma and because generally people don't really understand the relations between these other types of people (dealers/addicts) and can't relate to their situations or problems.
If you knew any, or talked to any, you'd perhaps see how seriously this deviates from the traditional, stigma fueled system that has been established in drug environments.
Buying drugs is not like going to the convenience store, it's that "junkie lifestyle" that's really happening on the streets. If we can remove that junkie lifestyle from the streets, out of sight, the stigma dissipates and laws are more easily changes to help addicts and punish suppliers and abusers. We can stop throwing people in prison for doing nothing but harming themselves. I hate seeing people who have just been dealt a bad hand that led to some sad, personal, life choices be punished for it. Theyre being thrown in prison for funding a black market that illegality has itself created.
There's more to it but I'm sick of typing. I hope you can maybe see how I'm not arguing in favor of drug markets but in favor of keeping addicts safe, and getting them help.
We're doing everything backwards in the US.

I know this isn't what you all want to hear, but as long as drugs are illegal bitcoin won't die. The dark net markets alone could keep the currency afloat, but if that's all they're being used for one could argue that they're "dead."

Venture Brothers has made me incredibly picky. There's a distinct difference between "smart dumb" and just "dumb," you realize after a few seasons of something more substantial than Family Guy.

Couldn't a crash from $1200 cause bitcoin to initially hit below its bottom? Like, it would rebound ($300) and drop again to stabilize at its true bottom (~$200) for a while before starting it's incline again? I don't understand this part of bitcoin very well, I'm just making questions.

@_date: 2015-04-14 19:05:45
I wouldn't say much of that inflated pricing was real, though. How much of a hand do you think Mt. Gox had in its pricing? It crashed almost immediately after (and during) the closing and continues to drop as sites like SR and Evo continue to go down.
Bitcoin probably shouldn't have moved past 200 or so yet, it was it's immediate and widespread use on the black market that gave it so much value. There was a ridiculous amount of demand for magical Internet drugs, which caused a lot of demand for bitcoin but the demand was never FOR bitcoin during that time. It was a vital means to an end and if anything Ross said about Karpeles and his affiliation with SR is true, he was likely manipulating the demand to increase the value.

Why keep bitcoin out of an exchange during a bubble, specifically?
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:20:59
Surely coinbase couldn't pull something like this off, though? I mean, they're certainly no Mt.Gox. Could someone actually hack coinbase and the repercussions would be on the customer?
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:25:49
I don't really think tech support is the right avenue for these sorts of things.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:37:31
If coinbase were hacked and their users were left out in the cold, bitcoin is going to be in for some serious rocky roads in the future reguardless of whether or not you kept your (what would then be inherently flawed) currency during the coinbase crash.
Who would invest anything into bitcoin if the largest, most reputable and most 'official' bitcoin exchange could just be robbed blind with no penalty?
I'd certainly struggle to stay on board.
Like I said, coinbase is no Mt.Gox. Nobody was entirely surprised when that ladder tower came crashing down.

Have you ever seen one? I bought a Hisense (that same model in 32in), I thought I'd regret it, but for the price they offer a surprisingly good picture.
I'm sure it's not worth that now, it's dated af, a little worn, but it wouldn't have been a bad deal 2 years ago. It's a great brand to look for on sites like craigslist if you just want an extra used tv.

Aluminum is around 80c per pound last I checked.
Recycling glass isnt profitable because nobody wants to use it, they'd rather drain resources for a slightly higher quality product or less effort than spend time purifying glass for reuse. It's a lot harder than just melting down aluminum cans.
That doesn't mean it shouldn't be recycled. If taxes have to subsidize the cost, I'd rather have them spent on keeping our planet clean and in resources than having that money spent warring and bailing out corporations.
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:48:11
Most people work for about 10-15 cents a minute. It would probably take all of 10 seconds to deposit the can and scan the machine with your phone, instead of throwing it into the trash can. Hell, you could even bring TWO cans and double your profit. Bring a whole bag!
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:45:50
I mean, you're paying for the bottle after all. A barrel of crushed aluminum cans  can be worth as much as $100 and it's practically impossible to recycle glass, tin and steel without just giving it away.
Half the cost of a god damn snapple is the glass bottle itself.
