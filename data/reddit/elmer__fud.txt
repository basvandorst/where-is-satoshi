No. Banknotes no longer have anything to do with gold.
Back before the gold standard failed banknotes actually were, in theory, IOUs for gold but they were bearer instruments, meaning that the physical holder of a banknote was considered its owner. Nobody needed to consult a private ledger to figure that out, whereas the Coinbase "bitcoins" are actually bitcoin IOUs that are tracked solely by the Coinbase private ledger. If you consider that equivalent to an on-chain bitcoin then I don't know why you'd even bother to create the bitcoin system in the first place.

In the sense that FDIC payments don't go to the bank but rather to FDIC, and banks don't regularly run away with customer funds because 1) they have effective, legally mandated financial oversight, and 2) in the event it happened the responsible parties would get caught and sent to prison, and the funds returned to customers.
This regulation is the fundamental reason why banks, unlike bitcoin enterprises, don't run away with customer money and are thus considered safe.

The only people who actually want to buy stuff with bitcoins are the early adopters who got them for much cheaper, and can thus make a profit. Since the merchants accept bitcoin payments through payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase, it's their investors who are currently footing the bill.

That's exactly what the purpose of this measure is. SNB is the Swiss central bank, not a normal bank, and the account holders are mostly other banks. Now they no longer can store their money in the central bank waiting for better times, and are more likely to inject it into the economy.

Okay, fine.

Bitcoin has some niche uses as a medium of exchange, but that does not mean that the unit price should be high. The current price is based solely on delusion and greed, and that's why it's crashing.
Edit: Quick super-simplified example based on just the equation of exchange, MVP=Q
M is the size of money supply (in BTC),
V is the velocity of money (1/year),
P is bitcoin price (USD/BTC),
Q roughly corresponds to the size of the bitcoin economy (USD/year)
Now try to find a set of values that justifies the current price.

Not really since the point of deposit insurance is that the depositor does not lose anything. With the bitcoin scams and mishaps the victims typically lost everything.
I'm not saying that for example an automated, transparent auditing system would not be a useful tool.
My point with the regulation is that a "fully trustless" system will never be secure. There will always be an unexpected design flaw, technical breakthrough or a clever social engineering scheme which allows someone to bypass the security and defraud people. Without the ability of other human beings to intervene they will get away with it.
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:23:11
You misunderstand the idea. Because of FDIC-like insurance schemes individual banks can fail, shareholders can lose their equity, yet depositors get to keep their money. It's the banking system as a whole that is safe, despite occasional bank failures.

SEPA from Sweden takes longer because it involves the conversion of kronor to euros. If you do a SEPA transfer from an euro-denominated account it should be just as fast as elsewhere.

Why should these transactions which use the internal, private, centralized ledgers of a private company be considered Bitcoin transactions at all? They don't use the protocol or network in any way, basically it's just customers shuffling Coinbase IOUs around.

Transaction Malleability served its purpose, that's precisely why Mark introduced it when he designed the Bitcoin protocol.
Just take a look at the early Bitcoin code, it was clearly written in PHP and then translated to C by Dorian, Finney and Szabo.

Now this may come as a surprise but when you buy your $10K aren't crypto-alchemically transmuted into butts. They go to the seller who then deposits them into his or her bank account. The banker does not care.

SATOSHI MINED ALONE
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:39:34


That doesn't sound reasonable at all.
The bitcoin blockchain will never be used to secure anything truly important on a large scale. This is simply because the POW security model (mining) has linear scaling which is terrible, as any competent security/cryptography expert will tell you.
Simply put, if a malicious party doubles its computing resources, all the honest miners have to do the same just to keep up the status quo. Compare this to a well designed security architecture like RSA, where the attackers doubling their brute-forcing resources can be countered by adding a single bit to the key length (exponential scaling).

But enough about bitcoin mining.

Renewable energy is not free. You can always use it for another, possibly more important purpose.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:05:33
This does not help at all unless the fundamental security issue is resolved, and so far nobody has proposed any solution. The sidechains cannot be more secure than the main chain they depend on, and thus inherit its weaknesses.
