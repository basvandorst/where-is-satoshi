What does my political affiliations have to do with my inquiry here? 
Checked there. No good. Uploaded the txt and a sample file. It’s not a known one. The persons business had an open RDP port directly to their server and a China IP got in and attacked. Other machines on the network also had the same credentials so it was easy to spread. Very difficult and expensive learning experience

That’s good to hear. The individual this happened to found a friend of a friend who has BTC and he offered to help out. Fingers crossed now

The delay is the pain in the butt. Everywhere we’ve checked either has significant delays or limitations to start. I’ll forward that link on thank you

It’s worth the high amount of money to try to get the data back to them. It’s a business. The backups are also encrypted. A lot of money but there’s nothing else to try. Awful situation.

They had an open RPC port. An oversight and a lesson learned

Local PD sergeant said he’s had more cases where they don’t get the data back. I’m hoping you’re right though as the business owner is most likely going to pay. There’s zero recourse that I’m aware of if they just take the money and run. Scary stuff

One from February... it’s bad
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:26:20
Not myself but yes

Not sure what else to do. Even local PD said only hope at ever getting the stuff back would be paying but they didn’t want to endorse the idea either. Attached backup devices also got encrypted. Decades of data gone. 
Please don’t scold me on best practices though lol it’s not my business. Messaging on behalf of a friend because he doesn’t know what to do.

My suggestion to them was acronis. They have cloud storage and Ransomware / encryption protection.

It’s a property management company that got encrypted. No other choice but to try.
@_date: 2019-12-29 04:04:26
They offer one free decryption to prove they gave the ability to do so. I was thinking what you were until I heard that. Just posted in the Ransomware sub as well. Hopefully someone has some input. Can’t identify what attack was used unfortunately.

Friends and family ended up being the way to go. Friend of a friend rather. After getting stuck with waiting for verifications or having other initial limitations, this was the easiest way to go
