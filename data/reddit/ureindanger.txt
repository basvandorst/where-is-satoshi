Roger Ver is a fraud anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:26:37
Heheh perfect, scammer Roger in the true light.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:38
Good advice!
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:19:53
It's because some people are just racists and don't trust anything connected with Brazil.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:53:16
ahhh gamers :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:05:24
True, but even if Bitcoin disappeare now, alts would remain existing after a harsh dip.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:08:56
CoinMarketCap deleted from bookmarks, LiveCoinWatch added, thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:15:05
Roger Ver is is a douche bag.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:56:54
Yeah, I get your point and it makes sense. I think the more adoption happens, the harder it will be for them to ever block Bitcoin. See how S.Korea reacted over the ban proposal, they gave their government a warning straight away since they are the ones who do the voting and give permission to politicians to do politics, but when they cut into a healthy flesh then they had to stop right away. I hope the same way public in USA will react if such proposal ever gets into motion.
When Goldman Sachs is building crypto exchange, then you know that Bitcoin is getting a huge approval and after few more crypto projects from the big financial institutions, Bitcoin is getting into a great position since soon it won't only be "USA government vs Bitcoin", but it will be "USA government vs Jews &amp; Public &amp; Bitcoin". I think everyone know how close "jews" are with the USA government, it's almost like talking about the same subject.

Oh, this explains everything!
Lame move by Stripe, just lame.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:23:30
By temporary you think Rootstock team will do hard fork in the future and exempt themselves from fees?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:48:57
2 transactions, not 3, and CURRENTLY fees are 20$.
When many enter LN, fees will drop drastically since on chain transaction number will diminish.
Also you won't need to close the channel since everyone will be using LN and for you it's the same where do you store your Bitcoins, if they are in open LN channel or not.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:24:07
Fuck China, fuck regulations.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:04:49
All this won't matter soon with LN.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:21:21
Perfect! It's happening :)))))
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:32:22
Pure speculation.

@_date: 2018-01-16 09:30:04
Interesting theory but seems like crap honestly.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:51:35
Well with Bitcoin on LN first, ShitCash will most likely stop to exist before implementing LN since it has no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:52:12
Many make conclusion that LN is distant because they see poor Segwit adoption. But LN hype and Segwit hype is something completely different and businesses will rush to implement LN.
BCH lovers will soon be crying imo.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:16:04
"Their shenanigans"? UK/Gibraltar literally took their shit first.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:18:26
Fuck man, why not go live somewhere else, to some safer country, Ireland for example?
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:08:11
Rootstock is centralized, they even go that far to take 20% of fees for themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:12:40
They need to do an audit, without audit they are looking like a fishy business.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:31:13
I bet p2p transfer focused alts would also sky rocket in the same period.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:18:26
Make sure you buy when fees are low or you could end up receiving 15$ or even less.
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:43:02
I wouldn't say "kill", but it will definitely make it unusable for poor users and for smaller value transfer. For example 5$ transfer doesn't make sense on BTC anymore. Rising fees will boost other altcoins with lower fees.
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:14:34
Doesn't sound like CSW at all :)
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:39:00

Do you have to host your own node or you trust somebody else?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:09:41
What do you mean by "dominate"? USD will still exist even if BTC proves itself as fairer, better, whatever. Bitcoin is attacked all the time, but I don't see Trump heading to his financial department and forming an focused attack on Bitcoin, seems too SciFi to me.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:01:41

Exciting news! One question, how did they solve opening and closing channel spam problem?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:04:50
You got some great marketing brain (y)
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:23:25
There are so many other usecases into alts than the store of value. Also there is greed, people will always want to get more BTC by getting into alts. Also with the current adoption of Segwit and LN, you can expect congestion and high fees when the hype hits again triggering usage of other blockchains instead.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:09:00
Yeah you know me deep into my soul.
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:44:22
Still to onboard on LN you need to pay the fee.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:53:38
Careful there, you're playing with people's hopes and money and you'll get downvoted to hell because of it even if you speak truth.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:07:24
What do you expect from that savage country.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:52:26
LOL Brian's response is hilarious really.
He could clearly see 30% increase in BCH price before the listing occurred and therefore if he has any honest intentions he could have not list it after seeing the price increase prior listing.
Roger clown Ver tweeted about Coinbase listings in 2017 so he clearly knew it's gonna happen. This guy is acting like he's a father of BCH or something.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:58:57
Upvoted, hope it gets solved for you ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:35:13
Roger is a douche and a loser, no money can help him.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:57:56
Oh yeah, there will be blood, BCH will be the first victim.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:10:43
God knows what do they use those Tethers for, maybe they are used to buy BCH? :)

Hope jail becomes Brians new home for the next few years.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:59:33
It doesnt have the fix that BTC already has by having Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:48:03
Becahse BCH is a fucking fork. CONSENSUS is what you should be looking for and the only one who still has it is BTC :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:16:15
hehhe even if they agree to implement it in the end they will already be gone since BTC will have the first move advantage :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:11:08
Bcash has 100k transactions daily and they are all from exchanges. Basically Bcash has 0 real world adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:22:48
He is a clown.

Old news but shows a great use case for Bitcoin being a limited in supply.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:12
If he saw BCH price increase few hours prior Coinbase announcement, why did he list it at all? Also why did he let the exchange happen for those 4 minutes?
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:14:01
This kind of news give comfort in bearish days :)
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:23:51
Is there a BTC wallet at the moment that makes LN handling easy? Would like to try selling my service through LN.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:21:28
No, they suck. 8 $ monthly even if you don't use their service. If you want to close the account they will ask another 16 $ because it's hidden in their TOS. Stay away from Revolut.

Those are some faithful bagholders nowdays with current BCH prices.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:49:25
Didn't look like a good solution in December 17 with 400k+ transactions a day. 30 min for 3 confirmations?! I consider BTC as a perfect store of value and that's it, but there are many more use cases to cover using cryptography and blockchain. Ethereum with virtual machine and smart contracts is also "reinventing a wheel"? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:35:24
Proud to see the amount of great answers/info inside this topic. FUD is just not working over here, too much knowledge.
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:50:47
Eventually we will have to raise blocks for global LN adoption anyway, so why do it later after the shitsrom and not before to buy some time for LN infrastructure and adoption? How will someone from Venezuela open a channel for 20$? That doesn't sound realistic.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:56:55
How do we make big guys like Binance to upgrade finally? :/
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:13:18
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:32:39
I would wait for more confirmations of course. It sounds better then the disaster we're going to face soon IMO and we still have to increase the block size eventually, it's not a question of increase or not, but when, I say fast is the best option.
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:38:46
No I don't.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:12:42
Did Binance ever stated the reason why are they not supporting Segwit? I guess they are making quite a big percentage chunk of daily transactions on BTC chain.
@_date: 2019-03-22 08:38:40
Good news
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:45:01
Like 40k transactions daily? That would be few thousand dollars daily thrown away. Why are they spamming anyway? Why not using testnet?
@_date: 2019-03-28 12:40:49
Also cases like this one when they lock your account and ask you to prove the source of your tokens LOL [
Bitfinex sucks.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:28:48
How many transactions do you think Veriblock does on the mainnet daily?
@_date: 2019-03-21 19:15:54
Buy it, use it, promote it.
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:06:48
I understand but still we will have to eventually raise blocks to 64-128mb blocks to for global LN adoption anyway, why wait and get into congestion situation that will hurt LN adoption?
You always have miners who are incentivized to run full nodes.
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:21:00
In fact I forgot that I've recently downloaded whole chain via Bread wallet, and it took 2-3 hours if I remember correctly, and my mobile phone is total shite.

Nice post sir, thanks
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:47:38
As far as I know we're making higher lows since July. When it comes to Tether I agree, it's a huge liability and I love the fact that other stable coins are getting used more and more to lower the risk of Tether exploding.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:13:56


That debt FUD around Tether is pure speculation.
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:29:28
Great news!
@_date: 2018-10-08 08:30:46
No, I'm actually happy for every bit of adoption.
@_date: 2018-10-17 10:16:36
I don't think this will last long, USDT already went from 0.92$ to 0.97$ and not so long ago they did the audit and showed that their funds are spot on.
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:48:27
Hmm I see your point but it's pure speculation, no proof to back it up.

It ain't going to drop any further IMO! We're making higher lows since July. Also when you check coin.dance volume of localbitcoins especially in developing countries Bitcoin is bullish! Other than that Bakkt and Fidelity are around the corner. On the down side I fear Tether.
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:23:00
He was greedy yes, but calling him a retard in the current situation is not really nice. Binance should release his funds immediately and cut the bullshit which is clear by all the posts between OP and Binance.
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:29:02
IMO this argument doesn't justify it if there is a better solution to a problem. Or you don't believe the global warming which is a huge issue.

@_date: 2019-06-29 09:05:47
Can it go that high then it's expensive and congested on 14k?

be careful of what you think of.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:29:38
How will people from poor country start using LN when the entrance fee is already over 5$?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:51:01
73k unconfirmed transactions at the moment with fees being at 5$.
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:32:17
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:49:29
Any ideas how good it is compared to Wirex and Epayments for example?
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:28:29
There is still 55% of the network not supporting Segwit, but I guess we cannot rely on them and hope they will upgrade and support Segwit before the disaster like we had in January 2018 with 20-30$ fee per transaction.
We need more time for LN and Segwit to pick up and we don't have it so either it will be block size increase or disaster again.
I would prefer block size increase which would also make BCH and BSV pretty much absolete. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:49:59
It's not ready, today we had like 100k unconfirmed transactions with some users paying 8$ transaction fee and we're far from 100k, while you're talking about 300k, imagine the number of users and hype then.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:18:07
LN is far from being usable :/
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:26:27
But you do realize that eventually we will have to raise block size to 64-128 mb if we want global LN adoption to happen, right? So my question is, until when do you wait with the raise of the block size?
In the mean time, until that happens, other chains will just get new users and the congestion will become frustrating to deal with.
Other than that LN adoption will get crippled as well because it will become expensive to open and close the channels.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:33:50
Wow, didn't know that one. It's completely useless then. There was no need for it at all, just a bizarre decision by CEO.
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:54:08


Maybe yeah in the future Lightning will become easy to use for an average user, but today it's hard to use it for an average user and soon it will be expensive to open the channel.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:56:05
It's already decentralized enough IMO.
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:17:50
I don't care dude, bottom line is, Bitcoin is not peer2peer cash.
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:32:58
Even if they do it doesn't matter. Bitcoin needs to be resistant since it's a permissionles network, anyone can use it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:35:39
Soon, when congestion forces people to pay above 10$ if they want to be included in the next block, people will just start using other coins and pump their value that way which is a shame for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:17:26
I use Trezor. So you expect an average user to use only wallets with RBF option? lol...
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:10:55
That's what I've read on this channel from developers themselves.
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:16:19

All it takes for BTC to moon into few trillion market cap is to overtake PP, CC's and other expensive, centralised payments networks **online** and this extension looks like the easier solution than all the others mentioned, while you're also using permissionless, decentralised and and almost feeless service.

Preparing for Moon. :)
Our bodies are ready.

Hmm I don't think you gonna see those prices again, hope you didn't sold bro.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:29:22
I think this will go away when Binance opens it's doors today.
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:41:06
Yeah, I guess so.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:56:15
Great news, merry Christmas indeed!
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:12:36
Totally agree. "Shitcoins" will eat it alive in the end, but I'll always be a Bitcoin fan anyway.

Bitcoin mining is just a perfect match for Siberia.

Is it true that routing problem = max 100k users supported on LN before hitting the ceiling?
Is there a possible solution to this problem? 
I'm afraid BTC won't be ready for the next bullrun and that we're going to experience crazy fees once again which would be terrible. I also wonder why we haven't increased block size just a bit to buy ourselves time to polish LN? I remember all the miners voting for 2x. Another great thing about it would be sending BCH into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:43:23
Is there any LN wallet that is as seamless at using as any Bitcoin wallet? I'm not into setting up a node at the moment.
Is any exchange using LN at the moment?
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:10:23
We'll have to wait and see what happens :) I think BTC fees will soon be going through the roof and people stop using it for small purchases.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:52:56
Thanks! I know segwit adoption is at 50% so there is still 50% of transactions potentially switching to Segwit and getting us more room in the blocks. I just hope it will be enough for the next bull run, last time it sucked.

Hmm, I don't get this chart, because looking at the default volume, it's a huge contrast to late 2017 volume when the default volume and this one were pretty closely related.
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:03:49
What's the general opinion from people about cryptos? Is it getting used all over the place (I read DASH alone has 2500 merchants accepting it.) or you would say it still not so mainstream yet?
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:39:27
Fuck them, ignore and stop using.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:51:45
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:29:03
True if big.

I'm also interested in this topic. First question which comes to my mind is how to safely do the exchange bitcoin &lt;-&gt; house. At some point you will need to hand over the private key right? When do you do that, after the papers are signed? Will the property owner want to sing the papers without seeing the money first?
To me it sounds like escrow service is needed for this type of transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:53:38
But how do we reach consensus then if not by miner signaling?
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:06:48
Hope you're right :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:55:49
Hardly IMO, tomorrow Binance is opening deposits and it's the biggest gateway to altcoins, we'll see what happens. Also Tether/BTC buying pressure won't last forever. Congestion will happen sooner or later, raising the fees to the ruff and pushing users to alts but also to LN adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:25:33
He hopes, otherwise he made some terrible trades lately.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:49:57
Hmm, no I'm not a troll at all, just asking a question. Actually I love BTC and I'm pretty disappointed to get 5 downvotes for a question.
@_date: 2018-12-26 12:24:30
Will enjoy watching the downfall of Jihan, Roger and BCH all together :)
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:34:13
I'm pretty sure some mining pools would lose a lot of individual miners if they would be trying to vote something fishy to benefit only miners.
Isn't in whitepaper consensus defined by miners since there is no other way?
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:46:47
Jihan Woo is too powerful and getting him out of the game would mean more decentralized BTC. I also hopes BCH dies all together with him.

I want Tether out of the game as well, they've always had that scammy scent. But, I can't believe people calling for a flash crash. I hope they recover from that 850 mil loss, and people stop them using eventually. That way they would not effect the market at all.

Hate to spend my crypto. I always have the feeling that I'm overpaying for something because I know crypto will be worth much more in the future.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:31:31
Are you saying that is possible to double spend on NANO?
