It might not be readily apparently here at the end of 2017, but crypto absolutely will be used as a major medium of exchange. It's like saying back in 1992 that no one will ever use the Internet because it's too slow. It's completely ignoring all the innovations and applications that are yet to come that will open the field wider and allow more people ease of access.
That's where we are right now. In the next two years there will be many exciting additions to the world of cryptocurrencies, some which have not yet been imagined today. Bitcoin may not be the main medium of exchange, but it's already proving its value as a store of value (i.e. digital gold). The applications will only grow as time and technology march on.
The genie is out of the bottle and can't be put back in. You have to keep in mind that innovations are coming which will increase its scale and ease of use. It might not have been worth owning a cell phone in 1989 or having an Internet connection in 1992...5-10 years later, both are ubiquitous to society.
Edit: I don't know if Bitcoin will be the de facto world currency like many people seem to claim. Other currencies out there might be used instead, or have yet to be developed.

We might never see that price again. Keep in mind that literally everyone is waiting for the dip. There's too much hype right now. I expect it go to even higher before it starts to fall back.

Thanks, I corrected it.

There will be a dip, you just don't know when it will be.
Will it get to 12,000 and then dip to 8,000? Or will it go as high as 17-18,000 over the next months and then dip to 13,500?
Point is, you just don't know. You should buy something if you believe in it enough, if you think the value is going to go up over the long term.
No one knows when it is going to dip. The people waiting for it to go down to 8-7,000 may never see that price. It's not as inevitable as you believe it is.
As far as making a lot of money off $100, you're late by a couple of years. If Bitcoin goes to the moon ($1mil), that'll "only" get you $10,000, and by that point, the dollar will be devalued since Bitcoin will be so big.

Hell yeah!

Well assuming a $1mil coin .03 BTC would equal $~~3,000~~ $30,000. If BTC reaches that high, however, ~~$3,000~~ $30,000 will be worth much less than it is today

The 24 hour volume is very high. Usually hovers around 25,000 or so but now it's 43,000 and rising.

I sort of have an idea for sci-novel or short story where treasure hunters/spacers from the 23rd century look for the lost wallets since BTC can buy entire planets by then. Would be a neat idea.

Exactly this.

Yeah that hurts. I plan on buying more to replace what I've lost. I got a 20% discount so BTC would have to rally 20% in the next few days for me to break even. But I wouldn't blame yourself, there's no way anyone could have predicted the rise, and ultimately, bitcoin was designed to be used as currency so don't let the hindsight get to you.
