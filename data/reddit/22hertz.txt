Facebook censorship in full retard effect. Was trying to promote my new music video when I get this - access denied! At first I couldn't figure it out because I and my band have nothing to do with any type of cryptocurrency business. Then after much grief and trial and error I discovered it was because the snapshot that facebook got from my youtube account shows that I 'greatly appreciate tips'. I can't wait to see the day that this fucking centralized garbage faceshit site gets replaced by a decentralized version( and it's coming).

Then who was the first rock band with an album released accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:46:48
Yeah I should have stated in my original post a band with at least one album out.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:04:07
No, we're independent.
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:00:58
I'll look into it.

Our first show was Jan. 1st 2015, so yeah, we are starting from the bottom.

We are located in Toronto Canada with 4 members. The reason for my claim is at the time in early 2013 I searched for bands accepting bitcoin and I didn't find any. If their was, they were not announcing on the interweb.
