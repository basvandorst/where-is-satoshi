Gemini. Tiny fees 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:09:48
Moving money takes time. It's exactly the same for every exchange, about a week wait. At least Gemini you are able to trade btc and eth in the meantime, while Coinbase it sits there completely unusable. Gemini fees are also significantly lower

Resumes? It's trading right now

Ditch coinbase and never go back.  Try out Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:56:41
Nah I think it's done going up 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:57
Oh okay. I haven't tried. Have only used Coinbase but have Gemini ready to go 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:57
Gemini is where you can buy Bitcoin and Ether with $USD, just like coinbase. It's also an exchange where you can trade Btc and Eth, like GDAX.  GDAX is the same company as Coinbase.

Yes. But they won't admit that they have no idea what will happen 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:45
What does pre-credited mean exactly? I have gemini and it looks like I have to wire USD first, wait a couple days, then buy btc/eth

How much do these organizations skim? What about real individuals that need help? Like a friend of mine is about to lose his house, wife was laid off from work, and now they have a second baby on the way. A single Bitcoin would literally save them

They probably did sell a lot of it. It would be super easy to withdraw a few million, put it in a high yield account and live comfortably on the interest

Crypto isn't stock. So is "insider trading" even illegal? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:37:29
Pump n dump. I'm starting to notice a lot of big names announce on their channels to buy Bitcoin. They do this because they already have a ton of money invested. If they hold while their millions of fans invest, the value goes up so their ROI increases.    
   
Pretty sure Tai Lopez is doing this at this movement

This is good for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:23:04
Yes it has to be claimed. I'm not an expert but I read something earlier saying anything under ~39k doesn't get taxed 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:34:56
would love this

Will there be a dip though? Last dip was $5900 and here we are at 10,000

My state doesnt allow gdax. Minnesota. Is there a way around this?
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:40:06
Same. Wish I just put it into my 401k
