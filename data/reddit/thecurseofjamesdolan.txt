This is actually wildly accurate.

It might not be "feel good Kool-Aid," but the reaction to it is similar. And the fact that the reporter agrees with your value set re-enforces that reaction.
You agree with the supposition, and you agree with the philosophy that led to the supposition. And so you think highly of the article and highly of the person that wrote it.
Rather than praising the reporter, you should be discussing his points. Can't he be wrong? Sure, there are other options than MTGox, but it's it a big deal when the biggest name in town continues to be unreliable? You can buy from a number of other exchanges, but the strength of a currency often relates to it's stability and overseers. And that extends beyond one exchange.
Rather than swirling in a circlejerk, I think the best place to approach most issues is from an objective point of view. Be critical, poke holes. That'll usually lead to a better product and discussion. 
Believing in something so much that you are unwilling to accept a counterpoint is often dangerous. You see the same thing with the adamantly religious, or 2nd amendment advocates or women's rights activists. People that fight for a cause, typically go to the mat defending that cause.
Those who disagree "don't get it" or "are ignoring the real issues" or sometimes simply "are liars." Those who agree are "a good reporter" or a "reporter who gets it."

As someone works in the news, it's really hard. Especially general news, where you cover so many topics. That being said, the person who made that graphic, probably wasn't the person that booked/interviewed Matonis. Whiffing the graphic, doesn't mean they didn't know who the guy was and what he really does.
The guy that made the graphic may not had an understanding of bitcoin and thought the Bitcoin Foundation was the organization that runs it. Horribly incorrect, but not an unforgivable mistake.

Supporting something to borderline delusion -- vigorously supporting anything good and comfortably ignoring any problems -- is not good for anyone. It's what every zealot does and a big part of what's wrong with the world.

That's how it works. Police agencies gather evidence, they file charges based on that evidence and issue press releases. Press releases are often posted on police websites/other mediums, twitter being an extension of that. Now I won't deny that the press releases are partly the police thumping their own chest and proving their worth, but it's also a matter of public record and access to information.
I do agree it'd be nice if we, as people, actually believed in a culture of "innocent until proven guilty," but that's a society wide culture change. 
It might not be a bad idea to change the system of when charges get released. Maybe wait until closer to the trial -- in case it's an incidence where evidence changes or gets update, clearing a suspect. That'd be a nice change. But then you have to walk the line between freedom of information and privacy for the accused.


No, if there's no evidence or probable cause that I've committed those crimes. But you can't be charged without some type of evidence, or at least you shouldn't be. And if you are, you can always sue for damages and send out your own press releases.

Because it supports the subreddit's agenda, acts as a commercial for this dude, even though the post isn't quite accurate.

What's a good website to start buying? I've been waiting for another crash to get in the game. I'm still kicking myself for not buying in ~2011 when the price was ridiculously low.

That's a little hyperbolic.

No, they are doing the 21st century equivalent of sending out a press release.

It's not just this post. It's the whole culture of "Hey this is good... upvote upvote upvote" without any thought of the content or skepticism. It's not just this post, it's all of them.

You can say they're concerns or a risk of losing the reserve status. But to say it's in any way imminent is overblown.
