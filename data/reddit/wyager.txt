What do you mean? Satoshi himself suggested the notion of SPV wallets in the initial whitepaper.

Bitcoin doesn't need more than a few gigabytes of storage. A few hundred gigabytes over the next few years. Getting a few hundred gigs of SSD storage is cheap compared to the costs of other components of server hardware. Those costs will only go down.


That is completely incorrect. Coinjoin is practically unbeatable. Even the "best" (in terms of just privacy) proposed solutions, like ZeroCoin, are only marginally better.
Good luck associating stealth addresses reliably.


And how long will that last? They can do it *once*, and then they no longer have that power.

Namecheap has been taking BTC for a while. I used them to get my domain.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:29:01
Well, the person who created it clearly had some idea of its purpose; for him, Bitcoin was a lot about taking control away from banks.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:57:37
Maybe. But how would you do such a thing technically? And there can't be more than a few percent benefit over standard chain pruning.

Don't trust OS X (although you probably *can*, you also probably *shouldn't*). However, since you're using Armory, you're fine.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:08:38


You don't have to. If you happen find a place that no longer takes Bitcoin, fix it on OpenStreetMap. There are many thousands of people using OpenStreetMap, so eventually all mistakes will be fixed by someone. That's the power of wiki-style editing.
Your criticism is like saying "I'm not going to edit millions of Wikipedia articles."

You clearly haven't been here very long. Today's exchanges are exponentially better than the old ones.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:14:01
If you buy on an exchange and then immediately withdraw, the risk is very low.
You could also use a different purchasing mechanism, like LocalBitcoins.

You may want to look up BIP 70. It's an in-progress protocol for human-friendly Bitcoin payment links.
You can already have a `bitcoin:` url, which is pretty nice.

The nice thing about Electrum is that you only have to back up your seed, and you have all the addresses you will ever use backed up.
Once you start importing private keys, that's no longer true.
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:44:06
In what regard? I don't use any kind of bank at all when I work with Bitcoin. In fact, none of the people I know who actually understand Bitcoin used a bank or exchange for anything more than purchasing BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:45:04
Banks also support withdrawing cash.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:09:16


Unfortunately impossible. Addresses don't actually have "balances". Bitcoin transactions are scripts that can be of [pretty much arbitrary complexity](
For example, I [send the same transaction to 3 different people such that they have to vote to spend the money.](
For these reasons, there's no way to tabulate the "balance" at each address. The concept of "balance" doesn't really exist in the Bitcoin software. Only transactions have values, not users. The protocol itself doesn't care who can spend a transaction.
When you see a "balance" in Bitcoin-qt, what that really means is "The total value of all standard simple transactions that you are able to redeem is X BTC."
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:49:06


Yeah, so now the government knows that 1f4675fgnx748owhx4w58of7xh4w48fnx7 sent money to 1hz45fn784z87fhnw4z87zw4857hn34r55. Big whoop.
If you don't want the government to know about your BTC usage, just buy with cash and then be careful how you spend, or mix your BTC through a trustless mixer. Any such links are completely deniable. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:42:00


No, but that doesn't mean the government is the only entity capable of building it.

Also, if John uses a trustless coinjoin system, good fucking luck finding *any* connections.

"Wow bitcoin is so stupid, who will build the roads?" and "Doge is so much better!!1!11! 1 second block times!1!11!" are not constructive criticism, they are spam.
Every time I've seen actual constructive criticism (or unconstructive, but otherwise valid, criticism) of Bitcoin on this subreddit, it's been upvoted and addressed.

You can remove the business yourself.
CoinMap pulls data from OpenStreetMap, which is wiki-style editable.

The ability to quickly query any address's balance and UTXO set is nice.

My mid-range laptop processes around 700 transactions/second. So we're currently choosing to cap the network at about 1% capacity (for my laptop). Factor in Moore's law and the many ideas for further optimization and we're completely fine.


Stealth addresses, coinjoin, BIP32... need I say more?


In what way does this actually negatively affect Bitcoin? I get why people don't like uneven wealth distribution by itself, but literally *every* exchange system throughout history has had rich users and poor users. This has not prevented the systems from being effective.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:27:11
I hate this subreddit because of the dogecoin pumpers, irrational defeatists, and irrationally optimistic people. At least posts like these cause interesting philosophical debates.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:22:35


Right, so why can't people just purchase road passage rights directly? It would be nice if we didn't have to funnel the money through a wasteful bureaucracy first.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:14:17
Why? Coinmap uses OpenStreetMap, which is user-editable and highly extensible.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:02:35
Not quite. That's not actually how quantum counter-crypto works.
ECDSA is vulnerable to quantum solutions to the DLP, so any address from which money had already been spent would be unsafe.
However, Bitcoin addresses that have not yet sent a transaction are also protected by RIPE160, which is relatively safe from quantum attacks.
Of course, we *would* want to change to some post-quantum signature algorithm well before this is even an issue.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:47:58


Do we really want exchanges to treat us as poorly as "normal banks" treat us?
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:29:03


Yes, I know, but I don't think it's very reasonable to call Satoshi the "CEO". Bitcoin isn't a company. I was just pointing out that the title is a little silly.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:50:24
Free market indeed. Now Vircurex will fail, and a better company will come to take their place. Probably one that implements proof-of-reserve.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:20:58


No, because some transactions have more complicated spending requirements. For example, "only this pubkey can spend, and only after this date, and only if this pubkey signs off on it."
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:59:28
I have some of my Bitcoins right here on my phone. Easier than an exchange, and safer too. People simply need to do a bit of research before they jump into something.

This isn't really P2Pool as it was intended. The whole idea behind P2Pool is that you *are* a node.
This is better than nothing, I suppose...
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:50:56
I disagree. I've seen a *lot* of distinctly critical posts at the top of the page. I also look at the new posts from time to time, and whenever I've seen a critical post that brings up a good point, it gets at least to the bottom of the front page (sorted by "hot").
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:42:53
Yes, that's called "pruning" and is currently being developed. You can actually do it live, not just annually or whatever.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:43:18
Again, this is basically just pruning.

You think most consumers know how credit card protection works under the hood?
Consumers can be insulated from this sort of thing. Or they can just not use it, since the trust relationship is usually "trusted seller, untrusted buyer" anyway.

That's a client implementation detail. Most modern Bitcoin clients have this as well.

Bitcoin's resilience to fractional reserve doesn't depend on *anything* but people not being stupid. You simply need to *hold your own Bitcoins*. You *clearly* do not understand the purpose of BTC if you leave your coins under someone else's control.

It's *exceptionally* unlikely that we will actually need 100MB/10min any time in the near future. It's just good to know that even a relatively weak computer could easily handle that much.
Also, service adoption grows by, at most, an S-curve, which will level off. Moore's law grows exponentially and will probably not level off any time in the very-near future, especially in the area of storage technology.


That is completely, absolutely false. I think you may be confusing coinjoin with something else. Coinjoin supports an arbitrary number of users, limited by block size.


Which means wallets can easily and securely use a new change address every time.


Which means that the new address is *only* known to the transacting parties, and no one else. It can not be linked to the owner's other addresses unless the owner uses inputs from multiple stealth addresses.


If some rich bitcoiner wanted to try to fuck with the bitcoin economy, they only have a finite money to spend. Pump-and-dumps don't cause significant net devaluation.

Yeah, if people use Bitcoin in the worst possible way, completely contrary to the purpose of Bitcoin.
Obviously the government can take money that is held in a centralized location by a single entity. The whole point of Bitcoin is that *you don't need to trust anyone else with your money*, and if you do it right, no one can take your money from you.

I'm fairly well versed about how Maidsafe claims to operate. I could critique it better if they actually released a reference implementation instead of vague impossibilities.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:08:31


Maybe you're not understanding me here; *I* can compress it very easily, but no one else can. As far as the maidsafe network is concerned, I have petabytes of data, but any machine I control knows how to reduce that to a few bytes. 


Why? As far as the rest of the network can tell, I'm operating normally.


Again, why not? How does the network do distributed random selection? This is generally something that's pretty easy to screw with.


Why not? It doesn't actually cost any money to run a node (and I could run a billion nodes off the same machine), and it's not like the network can force me to store anything.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:53:44


No, of course they haven't talked about it, but it's the only way to prevent gaming of Maidsafe's consensus system.


Because it's impossible to have distributed metering consensus. Depending on the mechanism used to allocate and reward storage, I can always do something like store "exabytes" of trivially compressible data for myself (while pretending to be multiple people) and earn tons of safecoins doing it.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:56:36


How do they decide "randomly" in a distributed manner? What prevents me from tampering with this "random" selection, so that the chunks go on machines I control?


Even if the distribution of selected "vaults" was a PRF (which I doubt), I could still attack the network by making trillions of sybil vaults.


And if I request exabytes of data? Will the cache nodes cache all that for me?
You're just running around the actual problem, which is that (as far as we know), distributed metering is impossible.
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:23:47


Unless the node selection isn't really random. I can store it on arbitrarily few physical nodes.


No, I will not. I can use trivially compressible (to me) data. I could easily generate an arbitrary amount of data from a few-byte seed.


Not if I'm paying my own nodes.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:26:01
Maidsafe is objectively a scam. Vaporware. "Safecoin" is impossible to deliver as they've described it.
They might just turn it into a centralized service, at which point it's not very interesting.
