Hah. Of course when you say nobody gives a crap, that sort of like saying there is no economic incentive. Intel could, but they dont. If there was money above their particular opportunity costs to be made they would. Maybe having a bunch of cryptos with that 'nobody gives a crap' property could be advantageous.

True true. I wonder if it is more accurate to say there is no asic-proof. The cryponight algorithm claims to be resistant and seems to be successfully resisting asics so far, as far as I can tell. I suspect the difference is in our definition of effective asic resistance.

As pointless as intellectual property itself. This does nothing a notary can't already do. IP is a dead man walking. Perhaps Ascribe finds a niche, but touting it as some kind of solution to file sharing is inaccurate. It doesn't even claim to mitigate, reduce, or effect copying of information which cannot ever be stopped and will only get easier. Capitalism is for the physical objects not thoughts, ideas, dreams, or imagery.

World Crypto Network has been producing increasingly better quality content for months, but today I clicked their latest video titled "The Bitcoin Group  Bitpay Hacked - IBM Bitcoin? NH Bitcoin Bill - Commodification" and received a message that YouTube censored the content for violating thier scam policy. 
The video has 253 views; Has anyone seen it who can report on the contraversial content?
