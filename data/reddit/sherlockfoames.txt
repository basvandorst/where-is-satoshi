There are very stark realities of over exposure is what it tells me, nothing more.

Of course the difference is low risk. Bitcoin is still volatile at the moment, great ROI sure... but we both have no clue what will happen in the next week. I'm hopeful for consistent gains of course but this is high risk, don't put in more than you are prepared to say good bye to

My middle name is Peter, after my grandfather who committed suicide after Black Friday 2 months before I was born. Settle your rage kid...
Reduce exposure by not having all your eggs in one basket

When it dips do not panic sell. Buy more!
Also keep your eye out for some good ICOs, do your research and enjoy the gains

Bitcoin is intended as a publicly owned bank. With this as the main intention of the service I would be upset if some small amount of people could fleece the system to make money.
Perhaps this is why it is so slow to be adopted, then again. Change is slow - Always has been, always will be.

Not if everyone accepts it as a reality, which is happening more and more every day

Do you understand the concept of a fictional reality?
Both gold and crypto are a creation of it. 
Sell your gold bro, before crypto destroys its value.
