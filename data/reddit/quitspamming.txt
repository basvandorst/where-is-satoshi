They are doing an active ICO for a 100% pre-mined "SendCoin".

Please, get this upvoted for visibility. Another horrible scam is about to happen (well, is happening). Lets save who we can.

Thanks for the input, Alejandro's Amsterdam friend.

Blocktrust should have zero reputation after taking this guy on. Just because they're on Blocktrust does not mean they can't send their own BTC to the sale.

The have faked their volume in the past days, showing life of traction. They were @ 20BTC a few days ago, now 150BTC. 
Trying to prevent anybody from putting money into it by being fooled by the fake volume, and so, you can see what kind of a real person Alejandro is.

While I agree, I'd prefer scammers to not get rich through fraud. Investing in an ICO with legitimate statistics is one thing, faking the transaction volume and support is another.

Faking transaction volume and a planned pump and dump is not "free market at work" -- its "scammers at work".
Thanks for your input though, Alejandro.

Faking transaction volume != putting money into the Bitcoin market cap. Also, never said that. Thanks again, Alejandro.

Lol, whatever helps you sleep at night.
