We are saying that users should be able to easily find all the key arguments for and against a given protocol change.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:35:38
You can’t. But you can come up with a set of rules which the majority of people will voluntarily sign up to.
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:04:15


I really hope this is not the case.  We believe that both Gavin and Mike are trying to improve Bitcoin in their own way.
It should be possible for the community to argue *publicly* and vociferously and then move on once the decision has eventually been made.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:35:51


I completely agree with this statement.  However, there is **not** consensus on how best to achieve it.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:11:45
Agreed.  Messy public debate (as occurs at "Speaker's Corner" in London) is not to be feared but rather embraced.
However, we realised the original proposal would implicitly lead to a more closed system where debate was carried out behind closed doors in future.
We wanted to take the opportunity to draw further attention to this.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:46:47
If it is still felt that the BIP process is fit for purpose then we should continue to use it. Mike and Gavin have chosen to side step this process, suggesting that it has not worked well in this case. We need to understand why and potentially make adjustments.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:15:23


This is an example of a change management protocol improvement. This process will likely be more quickly followed in future disputes, thereby bringing transparency to the debate and avoiding delays due to inefficient communication versus delays due to disagreement. In any community there is always a protocol (written or unwritten) on how to effect change. This is called politics, and we want Bitcoin’s politics to be as transparent as possible.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:29:45
Neither the length of time nor the level of ire is the issue.  Rather, it is the apparent lack of transparency by which some of the conversations were had and the more centralised governance process that may come about as a result.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:59:54
A Scenario:
Alice the NSA agent is back and wants to destroy Bitcoin or at least cost members of the Bitcoin community dearly.
1. She introduces a subtle bug in the protocol which would result in a serious zero day exploit.
2. A new release comes out containing the bug and Alice waits for it to reach widespread adoption.
3. Alice exploits the exploit.  For a short period she has complete control and uses it to seriously damage the Bitcoin Network and/or the Block chain.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:28:47
The change protocol should aim to ensure that all users of Bitcoin have the opportunity to hear all the arguments transparently. The length of time to come to a consensus is not the issue (in fact, we stated as much in our OP).
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:10:59


Bitcoin was specifically designed to be a decentralised alternative to the centralised financial system.  If it's management becomes centralised, even if the nodes remain decentralised, it will fail in it's core purpose.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:50:39
Agreed. However, if we make it through this particular episode, it is incumbent upon the community to learn from the situation and improve the way in which changes to the system are made so that episodes like this do not drag on for so long or reach as great a level. We feel that further decentralising the processes around BIP submission and agreement would be the way to go.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:12:25
No, but it *would* definitely be more rigid. The Bitcoin protocol is much more rigid than simply allowing anyone to print their own digital money and hope that consensus will resolve the double spend issue. Without the rigid set of rules that is the Bitcoin protocol, the system would fail. The protocol that governs changes to the Bitcoin protocol needs to also be both decentralised and somewhat rigid.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:26:16


Agreed.  The way Bitcoin defends itself is by its members highlighting issues and taking action to correct them.
One or two flaws can destroy a piece of software. Without people identifying and taking action to correct them, they will not be resolved.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:56:53


Yes, this *is* the case currently. The fear is, with 1 - 2 people managing the project, there would be less oversight.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:55:48
It appears most of the core devs do not agree...
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:32:57
Yes.  This is indeed how great changes start.  Innovators like Satoshi, Linus and Jobs all started in this way.
This is how great systems are started but it is *not* how they are maintained.
Proper maintenance of a mission critical system is considered, stable and gradual.
I would classify the X MB Block-Size change as a maintenance change.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:49:33


Is this an argument to move to a more unilateral and opaque form of governance?
Bitcoin is still young and some of its change management processes may need to be improved.  But potentially having 1 - 2 people control it will fundamentally weaken the goal of a decentralised payment system.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:24:03
This suggests that the BIP process failed on this occasion and may need to be improved.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:03:20


This is a fallacy.  If we believe that enabling the notarisation of transfers of bitcoins is a valuable service **now** then it should be possible to charge a fee for this service **now**.
Bitcoin has already achieved critical mass.  We now need to prove that people are willing to pay a fair market price for using it.
Mass market adoption is inevitable. We don't need to force it to happen but we *do* need to prepare for its arrival.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:41:51
The problem we see is the precedent that will be set for future changes to the Bitcoin protocol if Gavin’s proposal gains traction without having gone through a robust, transparent and decentralised process. I suppose this is a question of "Who watches the Watchmen?"
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:29:56
Both links show the developers saying that they are against a *near term* change.  That is not the same as not wanting any change near or long term.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:51:35


It is a widely held belief that most people *are* ignorant of the decisions which affect them.
Do you really think all bitcoin wallet holders will pour over discussions on redditperform all the background reading required, and ponder at length before downloading a new version?  How often do users do this when there is an update to iOS, Windows or Minecraft?  Why would it be any different for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:15:32
We are stating that the process by which any change occurs is as important as the final decision and will form a significant part of our decision on whether or not to implement it.
Also, as a concerned member of the community we wanted to voice our opinion and highlight a key issue affecting Bitcoin’s long term future.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:41:11
It is not easy.  Also, it may not be possible to have fully decentralised governance.  However, the more centralised the governance is, the more it is open to abuse, corruption and failure.
The current BIP process is reasonable, and has delivered progress so far.  Maybe it can be enhanced further but moving to a system where less people control changes to the project seems like the wrong call.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:36:52


I don't think we are at an impasse but progress is slow.  Many major systems (TCP/IP being one of them) take a while for changes to occur.  This will likely be more and more the case for Bitcoin over time.


Protracted and potentially heated public debate should definitely happen.  Opaque discussions amongst a few "more important" members of the community should be called out.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:49:55
Yes.  However, it would have been good if this had been done initially, *before* lobbying various exchanges and miners, as is the normal process.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:55:17
New ways of working may well be required, although I think getting inspiration from how other systems have worked in the past isn't a bad idea either.
More importantly, a system with frequent, contentious and existence threatening hard-forks will find it hard to gain wide spread adoption.
As mentioned in the OP, the more critical a system becomes, the more stable it needs to be.
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:01:28


A hijacking of this nature would presumably be very transparent to the affected user.  In this event, a possible improvement to SQRL, BitID, etc. could be the ability for the user's mobile app to log out of the same session by calling a "log out session callback URL" supplied at the time of log in.
This would of course require additional integration.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:43:30
Unfortunately most users will just upgrade automatically, trusting that other more engaged and capable individuals will ensure the software is "good".
I think it is incumbent on those who can to help does who can't for everyone's benefit.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:40:05


... and there still is no BIP.
Also, this may have been a sign that the prposal was not well thought out enough, premature or both.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:09:40
The key word is "publicly".
My understanding is that many of these conversations were not public and therefore it was not possible for the community to respond to and, if necessary, counter them.
We would prefer to see proposals stay public from the beginning.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:05:17
There is no restriction on who can contribute improvements to Bitcoin Core.  The same may not be the case for Bitcoin XT.
If it is still felt that the BIP process isn't fit for purpose then we need to understand why and potentially make adjustments.
The current BIP process is not perfect but it *can* be improved and the proposed alternative (reducing to two people) seems to be a worse state of affairs.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:17:13
Are you referring to the current regime?
AFAIK, the current process does not prevent anyone contributing to the Bitcoin protocol.  However, the complicated nature of the problem ensures that there will only be a small number of people with the unique skills, knowledge, interest, time and temperament to contribute in a meaningful way.
More importantly, if you feel that the current process is too centralised then wouldn’t the proposed alternative (i.e. moving to Bitcoin XT) be a backwards step?
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:19:55
What is your evidence for this view?  Is it solely the length of time the topic has been debated?  Would you similarly conclude that the length of time it has taken for people to ratify new versions of TCP is evidence of foul play as well?

If you do not choose to back up your Gauth (actually TOTP) tokens, they will not be uploaded to Authy's servers.  Furthermore, backing up requires a password and all tokens are encrypted client side before being sent to Authy.  If you add a new device, the new device will need and require your password in order to decrypt your TOTP tokens.

Just to be clear, BIP100 does not automatically mean a block size increase.  It could end up staying at 1MB indefinitely.
Rather, a vote for BIP100 is a vote for *the potential of* a block size increase without a further hard fork.

3 responses:
* Adverts fund content producers.  Replacing adverts with bitcoin generated by mining allows the content producers to retain an income without damaging your viewing experience.
* If AdBlock becomes pervasive, the quality and level of choice in online content will drop as  content producers are increasingly forced to leave the market or cut back their budgets.
* $399 is the price for this development version.  The final versions will be much less expensive (sub $50) embedded ASICs and software installed on mobiles, tablets, laptops and routers.
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:26:47
This is clearly a developer edition.  I would hope that later versions will be significantly cheaper and likely embedded in mobiles or laptops.

If 21 Inc were to preload bitcoin onto their Bitcoin computer there would be three issues:
* A number of users would sell all of their preloaded bitcoin immediately and then cease to use the device.  Mining provides a constant incentive to keep this device running and to re-engage with it.
* By mining, device owners gain insight into one of Bitcoin's most fundamental and innovative new concepts.  This may help start users down the road of greater understanding.
* There would be a much smaller resale market as users are unlikely to preload bitcoins onto the device when they sell.

It is often [cheaper to make something yourself]( (especially when you excluding your labour costs and profit margin) than to buy the same thing.
In general, consumers are willing to pay for convenience.  If this was not the case, most of the items on sale would not exist.
