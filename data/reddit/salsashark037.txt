Not only is it improbably, unfeasible, and likely impossible; there's no real reason to add decimal places. If Bitcoin's value grows to the point that you need to buy something worth less than one satoshi, then buy it with Dogecoin.

New plan, guys. Every time I decide to sell my coins or make a large bitcoin purchase, I'll let you know that the price is about to skyrocket.

Glad that I bought mine two days ago. This hadn't started yet. I received them in my account yesterday, so still at the lower market price. (Just under $500).

This is the easiest and most practical way to keep your coins secure. I keep most of my coins on a very secure wallet. A small amount (normally around .5 XBT) is in my mobile wallet (phone) for when I need it quickly. My Bitcoins never stay in the exchange for longer than it takes to buy/sell and transfer to/from my other wallets. Don't store coins in an exchange.

Of course this happens during the time of the month when I'm broke...

It's been a running theme for me. The price always drops after I buy. And just as you would expect, it always raises again after I sell.

Well, I just bought more, which has so far been the best indicator that the price will fall. Expect another 10% drop in the next 24 hours.

I think of it less like investing and more like donating to the network. It's altruistic. It's a way to help everyone that uses these tools even if there is no tangible direct benefit to you.
