I have yet to see this "informed consensus" that Bitcoin is traceable. What has been shown is that it is possible to use network analysis to gain high-level topological information about parts of the network and, in some cases, discern some identity related information from it. The concrete event studied was a reported theft of a large sum of Bitcoins (25k) that was reported on the Bitcoin forum. What they have essentially done is mapping out relevant parts of the block chain in the form of a directed graph and employed network analysis tools to make some interesting conclusions but in the end, no individual was deanonymised and certainly not through an inherent flaw in the system. Here is an arXiv link to the study in question: 
All this is a natural consequence of the fact that the Bitcoin block chain is a (necessarily) public resource. It really isn't a surprising result. Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous in the sense that you can do whatever silly thing you'd like (like bundling up all your money under a single account) and still expect that nothing can be concluded from the public block chain. However, in this scenario, where what.cd gives out unique addresses to each donor, provided they proceed intelligently about it, it could be quite hard to trace it back to them.
What is needed is an easy and intuitive UI that masks and automatizes this multiple-account handling logic so the average user can still gain some of the benefits from it.

It is extremely unlikely that this was a collision.
