NY resident here. I have been quietly bootstrapping a bitcoin startup for the last 8-9 months, and I'm a month away from launching. I have 10k+ invested, and I'm now terrified that this regulation will ruin everything I have been working on. The requirement they are asking will just push my launch even further away, and I can't imagine submitting everything they are asking w/o seeking extensive legal counsel which isn't even possible as I'm 'all in' already - and there's no guarantee if I did that I would be approved. It is not an exchange, but rather a new service that doesn't exist now… and it would involve transacting bitcoin, albeit in small amounts. 
This is currently a proposal if I understand correctly. Does anyone know how long it might be before the regulations go into effect? 
I will leave New York if necessary. At this point I will leave the country… and I'm now wondering where i would go. Could I conduct business with Americans from abroad? 
So many questions.

Now, the Ethereum developers want your bitcoin - and fast, before the NY regulations take effect.

Without revealing your identity, you are asking for $120,000 USD to fight regulation and your credentials are that you spent some time in traffic court ROTFLMAO. 
You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do.

No offense and it's ironic given the subject matter, but to me this site looks like a cash-grab. If I'm sending my bitcoin somewhere, I don't need regulation - I just want a little back story on who's receiving it and then I'll make my decision based on that.
