well considering i bought my bitcoin for my kid, it only makes sense to hold it n not touch it til he grows up
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:30
everyone that lost the paper wallet didn't deserve the 2 bitcoins anyway
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:25:20
diversity is up to my hubby xD he can try to beat me in wealth growth outside of crypto
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:21:32
all my money is in bitcoin and alts and i never felt better about my life 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:50:58
buying after it went straight up vertically is a no no
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:00:44

@_date: 2019-06-19 22:48:33

seen this from a nice chart on fb "dollar is money not a payment network. visa is a payment network, not a money. bitcoin is money AND a payment network"
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:28
that was great. i luv it.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:44:47
dont. btc might never drop below 5k, or it could be worth 1mil in 10 years, or it could go down to a dollar. dont gamble with a loan. gamble w money you can afford to lose
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:30:41
none of them said they already own some hrm. interesting
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:38:52
this. tho i am more bullish but you should always be prepared for the worst

universal basic income
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:04:39
he bought bitcoin at 20k
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:28:29
i think that is not the social credit yang wants. he has always been a very big supporter of universal basic income.

the sharp declines that happen out of nowhere with no bad news

the real satoshi has spoken
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:44:47
its always easy to see in hindsight. dun beat urself up for it. if u chose to be a hodler then just hodl for a few more years. market always go in cycles. what goes up will come down and what goes down will go back up. next time try to utilize ur experience from this to better ur chances of profitting
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:46:43
it's not forbidden. it's perfectly legal to own crypto in china and use it. ICOs are forbidden lol, and most (or all) exchanges.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:32:54
that's what i'm wondering too. why would the price manipulators want to crash the market this much, how will they profit once it's dead :P
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:49:50
they are the biggest miners for sure, but if they sell their BTC it would probably be OTC and not affect market price? another reason i think the massive dumps are caused by manipulators
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:02:40
i always say, if u already held from 19k down to now, why not just keep hodling xD dun got much more to lose anyway
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:06:25
having anyone holding so much bitcoin is never good. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:54:02
forget TA man, bitcoin is doing this to kill off bch xD
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:33:09
i think you have no idea what i am saying. the average joe doesn't need to know what the heck it is, just like the average joe has no need to know how an internet works in the backend. front end is all that matters, and front end is all GUI. grandma doesn't need to know how to build a computer to use a computer. and stupid doesn't need to know how bitcoin works to use a bitcoin IF wallets become user friendly
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:35:38
hopefully after this dump the holders of BTC will be more decentralized, will be a good thing if it ever comes back to life xD
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:05:35
he sold at 6k cuz he was capitulating like the other bottom sellers
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:50:39
hrm i would say mass adoption happens when ppl that uses the internet also uses it. it isnt that far fetched. most ppl dun understand the technicals of the internet either nor how to really stay safe on it but they can because the service providers make it easy for them. same will happen w crypto where it will be easy to use for grandma.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:51:58
it won't move up super fast. it will be a slow rise and if no dumps happen again, might eventually trigger another rapid bullrun
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:16:01
bcash is imploding atm, if this crash gets rid of it once and for all, it would be all worthwhile!
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:00:05
it will go back up but next pump will likely be less dramatic and next dump too. simply cuz there will be a LOT more whales at play. the market is maturing. however if mass adoption happens i think it will pump for years in a steady, healthy bullrun rather than a pump n dump run.

so much for being early investors. my portfolio back to last summer &gt;.&gt;

10 years ago it would be shocking for a 10 year old to code a website. now it's like no big deal, even my neighbor's kid can throw up a simple page. technology advances much faster than you think bro
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:13:15
i had a friend who wanted to use heloc loan to buy "the dip" back when the market fell from 400bil to 260bil. i told him not to do it, hopefully he listened xD
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:31:12
how do we convince u that it is xD
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:28:38
and this is why we all love bitcoin. right? right?
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:33:16
why not
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:43:40
dude it was at 3k for months
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:17:53
we all knew the risks when we bought bitcoin. right? right?
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:15:54
that alignment tho
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:17:23
i think having a porsche already screams "i have a lot of btc" nowadays
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:21:45
they think bigger blocksize is the answer to everything
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:12:57
those girls are obviously up to no good
