Early March: 1m $
Late May: 1.6m $
Mid August: exceeded 2m $ (though we don't know by how much)
Not necessarily to the moon, but substantial nevertheless.

Nope, I think they're top-notch AAA serious business players! 
Look at all the big words they're using here:

Requiring written consent from the party you do a withdrawal from, lest the withdrawer being fully responsible for any damages done.
Chargebacks are quite easy and are a quick and efficient way to get rid of pests hogging your account. That being said, in my 15 years of banking I never had to dispute a single transfer.

Dunno if Dell, Overstock and friends report on their Bitcoin sales volume.

Interesting - different countries, different DC building mentalities :) 
And there are quite a few [gaseous halon alternatives](

And I guess most merchants would happily pay for a business account at whatever bank compared to the risk and maintenance costs of holding your own coins in a live transaction environment.

There's this concept of a quiet and private place where you won't get disturbed by people trying to shove you random things down the throat, say for example, magical internet money.
I'm annoyed enough by telemarketers and people doing phone surveys, if anybody would try to push Bitcoin on to me at my doorstep I'd probably go ballistic. But that's just me, YMMV!

Though they look like regular water-based sprinklers they usually are hooked up to some inert gas. This usually suffices to put out fires without killing the hardware in most cases.
You can easily spot the water-based ones by having a small [glass ampulla]( which bursts when being exposed to heat.
To this day I haven't seen a *serious* datacenter sporting a water-based fire protection system.

Yes, especially with all the anti-money-laundering regulations in place, the central banks KNOW NOTHING and are shivering in fear of what may come. /s

Nobody uses Bitcoins for drugs, mmkay? Or hit contracs. Or DDoS. Or buying malware. Or buying stolen data. Or anything like that at all!

I'd go with "mostly used for that", but that's just me.

If you're holding _A LOT_ of bitcoins, get some people with security know-how involved, otherwise chances are that you'll end up as a sob-story here months/years down the line.
Imagine you're holding the equivalent amount in cash in wherever your computers are located - I guess you'd get some extra security installed by people who know what they're doing as well.
