Haha, I have no idea what that means but thanks!

Damn. Thanks for the quick lesson. Not sure I'll bother to try getting into this but learning a bit about it has been pretty cool.
How do people actually store bitcoin by the way? Is it literally just one website that secures your total amount? Or are there like specific apps or programs you need to monitor yourself to make sure nobody takes them or something?

I still have absolutely no idea how to even obtain Bitcoin or what it even is. But it seems every week or two its hitting a new high and you're all super excited about it. Its pretty cool to see people who understand it, seemingly, doing successful and well for themselves with it.
Good luck to all of you and hopefully you continue to see success with it!

What stops the government from stepping in and regulating then? Is there a central organization that circulates and monitors this?

So how do people even come upon bitcoin then aside from buying them? People "mine" them or something?

I don't understand Bitcoin nor have any idea how you earn them (or come by them?) and store them. But evidently this seems like an exciting time for all of you who do. Hope you all make a small fortune! Good luck!

I still don't even understand what bitcoins are or how you go about obtaining them. How do you store them? How do you keep track?
I've never understood it and I tried to learn it back in the day so I could buy some early just for fun but I couldn't wrap my head around it.
I guess if I had just tried a little harder maybe I'd have a bunch of money by now.
