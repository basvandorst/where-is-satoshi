I think you've misunderstood blockchain.  It doesn't require bitcoin to function, it's more of a protocol to distribute transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:50:34
Here's your homework assignment:
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:27:12
what was the tweet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:14
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:02:56
Same - I don't hold much but I just sold enough to cover buying in plus a little spending money.  Something's fucky..
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:04:49
And?  It's true - you don't know.  Nobody does.  ^^^^^(except ^^^^^the ^^^^^mega ^^^^^whales ^^^^^who ^^^^^own ^^^^^everything) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:26
How convenient...didn't this happen before too?  
Super sketchy
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:52:10
Ballsy bordering on reckless..can you afford housing/food if it does crash (emergency fund)?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:04:40
Is there a place/site to watch BTC futures in real time ala gdax?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:42:53
Bingo...still don't understand why futures are a thing (what value does it add since you're not actually exchanging the asset?) but thanks for the link!  
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:37:07
Why not just buy the actual bitcoin?  Won't it's performance reflect the same as these penny stocks?  
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:36:00
Feel like it'll tank soon too
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:02:51
Because companies utilize Reddit as a platform for free advertising 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:22:53
This was actually really cool - thanks for sharing!  Subbed 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:30:10


@_date: 2017-08-11 03:45:38
Just because it's free doesn't mean someone isn't spending the money or time (=money) for "grassroots" exposure 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:58:07
Needed to read this right now.  Thanks,
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:27:37
According to who?  
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:00:39
Is this true?  Or are you spreading fud?  
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:38:07


Holy shitballs
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:21:42
I'd be very surprised if we created true quantum computing in our lifetime 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:24:27
I'm still not sure I get it :/ If I moved my btc from coinbase to a paperwallet - how do I sweep *both* btc and bcc?
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:02:54
Man, if you think the value of btc and other alts hasn't already been manipulated by truly big $$$/corporations, you need to wake up and smell the coffee 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:12:08
I'm just salty I didn't do anything with my bcash
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:16:23
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:50
I was primed to sell at 12 but it never quite got there.  Bummer
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:45:17
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:13:57
welcome to reddit
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:57:16
Stay skeptical - this is pretty inorganic growth  
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:48:23
Pray tell
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:29:59
I'm pretty sure it's like the g in "gigantic"
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:37:18
Hold the line.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:18:08
Not doing anything with my bcash will probably turn out to be one of my biggest regrets grrrr
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:32:49
Not at all, bcash was a failed coupe and in no way similar to regular dividends.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:58:28
Having to upload a pic of my drivers license sketches me out, guess I'll eat the coinbase fees 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:18:33
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:43:48
Why not sell close to 10k and use the profits made to buy more in the dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:39:35
With the extraordinary increase over the past, hell, *week* even - you don't see a correction soon?  
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:41:36
saltiness 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:54:36
I'm out at 12, buying back in when it tanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:46:12
The price has climbed way too high way too fast, there is no way there *won't* be a correction.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:07
Should bitcoin holdings be reported to the IRS? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:05:50
:D :D :D 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:35:45
ahhh, clarity.  Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:00:48
hmm sketchiness there 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:22:08
What else could they do to devalue?  
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:20:23
You don't believe in market manipulation?  
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:13
Sign me the fuck up for that!  
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:05:52
Doubtful, interesting theory but doesn't hold water 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:04:59
old hat out of touch 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:20:54
Isn't holding the opposite of betting emotionally attached?  
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:49:19
Sorry for being dense, but I don't get the association.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:13
Sign me the fuck up for that!  
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:07:20
For not talking about crypto all the time?...yeah probably 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:04:39
Damn dood you're just eating those fees up, eh?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:20
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:49:19
Sorry for being dense, but I don't get the association.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:09:56
From where, though? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:20:23
You don't believe in market manipulation?  
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:20:18
Hmm are you calling shenanigans?  Free press for the lawyer...
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:04:50
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:47:22
The likelihood of tracking down the attacker and getting coins back is next to nothing, unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:25:18
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:20
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:23:25
It's a pretty convoluted process 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:42:06
awesome - thanks!   
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:24:49
Isn't that always the best plan? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:19:17
...I don't get it...fiat = powder?  
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:25:23
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:29:12
What happens if I never claimed my bcash?  Will I lose it if I don't sweep before this fork?  
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:33:36
 I'm guessing?  
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:47:54
Why not - what does that indicate?  
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:30:25
What's the logic behind this claim?  
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:35:45
ahhh, clarity.  Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:12:42
It doesn't have to be at an all time high, it just has to be more than when they bought (minus fees)
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:23:58


que?  As in it didn't move?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:30:33
1 bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:45:39
Fool and his money...
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:29:44
You should check out all my sweet spinners 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:48:04
no, wait till it goes under 1k
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:40:36
 seems to indicate ETC is a bad play
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:30:10
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:25:58
Why 6?  Not saying you're right or wrong just curious why you think there.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:41:12
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:29:12
People are celebrating this because something that they own is increasing in value, making it a return on investment.  The economy doesn't run on bitcoin (yet..maybe never) so for now enjoy the ride.  
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:29:15
Thanks for this - I'm looking for a cold storage solution that will hold ETH, litecoin as well as bitcoin - any recommendations?  I've been wanting to get off of coinbase for the past few weeks but keep getting distracted.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:36:38
Interesting read - regarding his ethics policy, I can't imagine putting out this quality content and doing all this research without owning any bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:42:54
So for the time being you'd still recommend mycelium for an android wallet?  
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:53:55
What do you suspect?
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:08:34
Literally no one knows what's about to happen.  Buckle up, buttercup.  
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:04:33
I'm sorry but this all sounds like a terrible shit show.  Way, way too many question marks up in the air
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:33:13
Hodl: Balls. of. steel.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:38:20
What android wallet do you recommend?  Breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:44:01
Did you find an answer to this question elsewhere?  I'm very curious about this as well
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:31:59
What makes you think the fork is going to increase the value of bitcoin?  I can only imagine it will cause even further confusion for joe shmoe 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:45:18
Why so heavy in litecoin?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:29:54
:( ?? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:29:43
follow up question: Can I send multiple transactions to the same paper wallet address?  Not that I plan on accessing those bitcoins any time soon, but moving OUT of the paper wallet sounds like a bum deal unless you're moving everything (ie change address)
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:03:11
No one knows, man - do you have $200 to lose?  
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:41:43
Are you serious?  What's wrong with writing "lol" it's just additional information to make the tone of the message clear (snarky, in this case - typically jovial)
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:09:08
"Legacy" is what's live now, you want legacy?  Pick up some bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:16:06
You seem like you know what you're talking about.  I'm trying to move from coinbase to paper.  Do I have this sequence down correctly?  Coinbase wallet &gt; coinbase multisig vault &gt; bitaddress.org &gt; BIP-38 encrypt with 32 char rando string &gt; Print several addresses that I'll divvy up my bitcoin hodlings &gt; transfer from coinbase to paper wallet?  Is that it? 
Edit: Seems like BIP-38 might not be helpful.  Also, sounds like when I access bitaddress.org, I should use a usb bootable os, like mint or ubuntu
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:09:59
The more research I do the more it seems like taking care (!) of a paper wallet is the best route
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:07:16
Proof?  Are you speculating? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:07:26
The term itself or our devices being online?  If you're against the latter you're on a sinking ship, amigo  
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:55:50
Encryption ftw
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:16:13
Please let this be a joke
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:34:29
Still can't tell if this ride is fun or terrifying 
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:49:53
story time?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:00:31
Shit that's pretty funny, didn't realize that
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:27:10
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:47:56
To what application does it have potential?  
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:41:56
This is good for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:36:10
So, for the complete dunces out there...HODL?
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:54:23
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
