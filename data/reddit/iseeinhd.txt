Define “we”.

Can’t it be both?

I’m not even selling and this pisses me off!  Every single time there’s the slightest uptick in activity, Coinbase basically crashes.  If they haven’t figured out yet that these spikes in activity are and will be the norm... and they need to be able to handle them, then they never will.

Blockfolio app.  You need nothing else.

As a relative laymen - though having TRIED to have become as aware of the environment as possible over the past few years - it seems to me this 30% correction consists of about 25%, usual pump and dump bitcoin as the public awareness continues its exponential rise... and 5%, and orchestrated timing and/or priming of the “known to be coming dip” by the bitcoin cash rebellion.  
So.... they probably consider it a win. And maybe for them it is.  This portion is almost business as usual. 
What I don’t see as “business as usual” (ironically) is the “insider trading” scandal at Coinbase.  This has the potential to more significantly damage public and institutional trust and investment.  I think that’s what may make this dip different (i.e. potentially deeper and longer than usually).  Not only that but it will assuredly reraise and intensify the conversations and heat regarding regulation. 
I guess we wait and see.  �� ��������
Here ends my possibly completely misguided rant.

Am I the only one that hears "Canadian Bacon", anytime someone actually says "Canadian Bitcoin"?

Gotta be a 14k Gold meme out there somewhere...
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:41:42
So will 14k BTC when it hits 24k.

Super response!   Thank you!   How do I guild you sir?!
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:48:39
Lol... I do appreciate the feedback.  And yet my confusion continues based on then fact that there seems to be "absolute certainty" in both sides of the argument.

I bought at $2839.58...   also bought LTC at $37.25 a couple weeks ago.  Does that count?
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:27:58
So that has been made train of thought as well... and on that note... IF there is a HF and thus there becomes BCC and BTC, depending on how many people jump on board with BCC, how could this not have a significant impact to the value of BTC?   Seems if say 30% of people go the way of BCC, that would inherently reduce the value of BTC by way of 30% less demand, no?

Disclaimer: I am just knowledgeable enough to be an idiot when it comes to BTC, ETH, crypto as a whole....  And I posted this simply because I saw BTC ramping, ETH dumping and when I did a very brief search to see if something was happening... the first article that popped was that from the NYT. 
This is essentially a shitpost.  But I found the timing intriguing at the least.  
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:20:54
Meh, I’m happy to see 8k again.

Lol, touché sir... touché.
