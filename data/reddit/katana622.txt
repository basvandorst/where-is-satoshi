what happened to the coins?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:30:07
none really, thats the issue. The tech will survive and adapt, btc? not so much.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:34:32
Pretty smart!
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:46:41
im saying why call it bitcoin if everything is in satoshis? its like if we had dollars and then at 10k dollars we call it flobols or something.... you see what im saying? Everything should be said in bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:17:37
on credit card?
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:52:29
It doesn't work the same because almost all day to day transactions will be much much less than a single bitcoin. In fact there are only 99 amounts between 1 dollar and 2 dollars or 0 and 1. The same is not true for bitcoin.
In my opinion the denomination we should always use is bitcoin  (Maybe bits) and then make it clear using formatting or symbols etc to make it clear. With around 8 digits below 1 btc we will need a concise way to format a long number usually being preceeded by zeros. 
Calling something 100mil satoshis is not that clear especially from a mass adoption route.

I had 5 regular charges on my credit card, then 5 reversals, then 5 charges again. the first 5 charges had 20 dollar transaction fees each (before i knew about it.) the last 5 charges came with only 10 dollar fees. hopefully stays like that.... At one point my visa balance was -300 I didnt even know you could have a negative balance on a credit card.

i just dont get how if you have that many for such a low cost why not just wait and wait you almost cannot lose money and if you do it isnt a lot.

on coinbase, if i buy ach 100$ and it takes 7 days, do i get my coins at the price i bought if I didn't add usd to wallet first?
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:57:21


everything you said is not based on fact and is just your opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:11:19
Time to purchase is a few seconds what are you on about.
You get cash back monthly, so you make 1 purchase a month not daily. What?
You're still dollar cost averaging per month, trying to time the market is a shit idea and having a few dollars back a day won't do anything extra here it just makes you sound dumb.
Even with fees you will be ahead almost all the time on 2% cash back vs 1% so thats also a non-factor as well. 
Basically there is no reason to have the 1% crypto card vs a 2% cash back one. Let alone I use a 1.5% cash back with rotating 5% cash back on categories which is way way better than the crypto card in every way.

Also when you invest in a company the idea is you're investing in a company that is providing value in the form of products or jobs or services that will continue to grow. 
Some people see crypto as a gamble because by buying it you arent really developing products or creating jobs or whatever. With crypto you can help more by helping the network or creating products that make it easier for crypto to be used than you would help by simply buying more crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:19:18
im thinking you are just dumb.
why would visa care if people call banks? visa doesnt care if you buy crypto with your bank account. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:30:08
same with me! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:22:30
Did i say i was? I was saying for people who got in a long time ago the argument is valid because they are still up. 
For people like me or worse we are not up so the argument seems stupid.

Something you may not have though about eapecially in the early stages of adoption is the branding or marketing. Ks or whatever sounds completely foreign to new people. Maybe using a symbol to represent ×10^n and keeping bitcoins? Idk.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:51:54
yikes if thats true that costs a bit too much just to help out at least for me.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:22:38
Can someone pm me when it becomes 12k
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:17:20
transaction fees maybe? idk
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:54:17
Just because you think youre investing doesn't make it investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:38:26
I am someone who hasn't been following bitcoin since 2013. 2 months ago it was 20k. Just forget about it and youll be fine. You only lose out when you sell. If you were hoping for a quick flip maybe you're fucked but if you wait until the end of the year? Youll be fine!
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:25:22
This website is an ad for an ad agency.

Heres the definition take it however you want.
a person who uses encryption when accessing a computer network in order to ensure privacy, especially from government authorities.

people wont be getting paid in bitcoin probably ever. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:44:30
hows your credit history? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:54:53
10k to send 1 cent what the FUCK
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:37:16
thats how it works...you bought a certain price and you got it for that price. same thing can work favorably to you as well.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:21:09
you mean when buying?
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:55:39
If you got in way back in those months it is entirely reasonable to think that way. For me, it doesn't matter its still up 5 months ago because I got in at 11k a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:52:15
no it will always work, you just change how much a sat is worth ie:1000 instead of 100. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:17:52
i mean when people go to day jobs and get paid in bitcoin which will basically never happen.

And? If someone improves who cares why they did it. Its business.

I make 35k and 690 credit and got in so yeah maybe :/ sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:34:25

@_date: 2018-04-15 06:39:55
