I fell for it the last time Bitcoin dipped to 10k and panick sold, not happening again.
There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Multi-account? That's not me,  just one account here is enough to enjoy Reddit. Votes mean as much to me as all your remarkable advice given through our exchanges.  I would be honored if we could be bfff Reddit friends. If not I understand, this is Reddit after all.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:24:53
Yep, not budging, bought in at 5k and as majority has stated: "invest what your willing to lose". I might not get  rich off Bitcoin but it's still a great ride and learning experience. Is that loser talk? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:05:37
Thanks for the helpful tool. Don't forget Reddit also has that dash of sarcasm. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:10:55
Either way, enough about the piss poor job I did to convey my thoughts. Bitcoin is now down to $9.6k, getting a little anxious here. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:31:06
Tried my best, sorry if I let you down. I have limited resources at the moment. I'll make it right for you if that counts.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:49:27
Geez, thanks for dedicating that for me. No one has ever done such as thing,  I "liek" it a lot. I'm glad I used MS Paint, we would have never met and have this interesting dialogue along with the time you took to give me a Simba shout-out. You're the best!
p.s - your edit &gt; mine
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:02
Not me that's for damn sure... I'll be honest, last dip we had like this I panicked and sold.  Just checked it when it dropped to $10k and [idgaf]( , I'm hodling this time. Lost out big last time I panicked, just riding the waves now, shit won't phase me. A few weeks ago Bitcoin literally went up from 14.8 to $17.5k within a couple of days. Keep hodling everyone, you'll be sorry later if you sold.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:22:08
I suppose, maybe you can provide a link to acronyms that you cool cats use such as /s.  I'm just a lost cause, I need to learn to Reddit the right way like you, you're such a badass. /s
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:30:10
I can't imagine what those who put in at $17k feel right now, if they haven't cashed out by now.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:19:12
What exchange would you be using at the moment?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:18:42
Same, just ride it out. My typical luck in the past was I sell at 14.2 then market shoots to 17.5. I buy at 15k and market drops to 10k. IDGAF anymore, just let it be.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:32:29
That was great, lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:30
Call me a rookie then. Wake me up at $14k, every dollar counts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:29
Arms are heavy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:14:05
I'll feel better when I see a consistent $16-18k then upwards. Is the crash really over because we're at $15.2k? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:15:02
The floodgates are opened, crazy it’s almost halfway to $14k already.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:21:48
Just woke up to [$12.8k]( 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:37
Shits been getting real the past month, fuck that... The past days..
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:45:28
BTC kicked my ass today. Held steady at 17.3-5 all morning, I buy in at 17.3k and not even an hour later it drops to 17k, then slowly down to 16.5.  I need more patience, still learning the ropes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:20
Tell me about it... Once $19.3k hit I literally spilt my coffee while I said what the fuck out loud in my office. It's fluctuating between $15.5k to $16.3 and I'm just sitting here like [this now]( , watching GDAX. Really thought that BTC would break through the 20k wall, all in time I suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:23:33
[MRW](  I woke up to bitcoin edging $12K.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:41:53
$12k, got over the hump! HODL on, get this shit to $13k now. Been a hell of a month!
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:57:23
I asked myself that same question when BTC was at $5300, hesitant on investing when it was high. Glad I did, advice to you, better now than tomorrow.. look how far BTC has come within a matter of months. You won't get rich but jump on the train and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:34
This is [insane]( . Keep on chugging along BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:07:06
$12,988.. do it already!!! Come on $13k!
Edit : BOOM!  $13k!!! She’s picking up steam, HODL on because this rise has been fucking insane the past month. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:49
Hope you're right, I'm trying to be too. Last post I did was at $15.2k, within minutes it dropped to 13-14k. Very bumpy road right now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:32:16
I'm pretty sure it went to 25, sorry if I'm mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:24
I made that mistake twice, lost money because it recoverd the following days. Not doijg this again and striking out. As said before, put in what you're willing to lose. hodl is where I'm at. Either way, congrats on your gains?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:58
The people that got out at $8k are probably kicking themselves right now, nice chunk of money but $14 k now? Imagine next week, next month... I'm gonna hold for a loooooong time. BTC was all fun and games for me at $5k but this is getting better than expected. This time around last year I read articles how 2017 projected BTC to top at $1000, this went 14x that prediction. Even if only multiplied 2x next year that would be awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:03:31
Please fucking HODL! Not a huge baller on owning bitcoin but the money i invested has more than doubled. Want to see this thing hit 12k already.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:11
I think we broke GDAX, shit won't even load now.
My coinbase in the same boat.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:32:06
As coinbase is synced with GDAX, is there an app that syncs with Gemini? I'm interested in switching.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:15
I'm scared... It just dropped back to 17.1. Fuck! HODL motherfuckers.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:37
You can barely type, it's okay I just spilled coffee when I saw it jump to $18.3 after leaving my desk for a few moments. It's going back down now . $17.9. Come on keep climbing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:32
Hope not at this point, this is great
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:55:09
Come on [$8K]( !
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:33:04
That didn’t take very long. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:21
My mind right [now]( . $11k down to $8.8k now heading back to $10k.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:49:54
Would be useful if you mentioned said site. We like Bitcoins too... Unless you're trying to get us into a timeshare scam ��.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:17:11
No shit, I woke up to 10.9k , I don’t hAve several BTC, just enough to let me enjoy the ride and I’ll say it’s been a good one so far.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:04
Fucking couldn’t buy shit during the dip at $8800, kept getting errors, dammit
Edit: finally after several errors and “high traffic notifications” I got through at $9700. Watching GDaX like a mother fucking hawk right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:05
Same here with Coinbase, GDAX gonna give me an anxiety attack, one minute $10k the next $9.5k... like when do I put in on more??? All I know is shits getting real with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:34:02
Yeah, when it dipped to $5300 ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:14:19
I panicked because I'm a newb. I just started investing in BTC about a couple months ago, seeing it dip was breaking my heart. But yes, I did read that trading is a big factor in the dip, that is one of the reasons why I was hodling. Lets hope to see 7k+ today.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:52:09
I count the days when. BTC hits $250k, then we can use the Captain Ginyu meme from the namek saga.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:15
Damn, Bitcoin. You scary.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:56:11
Waiting for the next 7.5k dip.. now here we are stagnant at 9.2-9.4k. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:44:00
Tell that to the folks that bought btc @ 17k. Not that I'm one of them... Looks like all cryptos fall with BTC. Hodling stong waiting for the recovery. I bought in at 5k, gonna hold even if it dips below that. Again, as told many times: "only invest what you are willing to lose".
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:06:20
Nice username. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:58:56
Just let it roll, shit.... Fed up with how Bitcoin will meet Its demise. Yet when it soars to 14-16 k in a few days we we get the bullshit "Bitcoin will hit $100k in December 2018", get over it and let the chips fall where they may. No offense, OP...
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:08:26
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:07:36
I missed the 7.5k boat this morning... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:40:56
Make profits for those who put in at 17-19k lol.   I'm not in the red yet, I'll hodl indefinitely, I'm willing to lose what I invested. But I'm also being patient for the time when Bitcoin sky rockets.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:29:56
I can make something happen. I'll buy now and expect the price to plummet. Or sale and expect a good price spike. Works like a charm Everytime.
