i think i almost got myself ripped off on the same one! it looks identical to the helix site right? luckily after losing 400 bucks the first time i triple checked everything before i did it and realized i had a scam url , i totally agree though dude I don't use anymore darknet bitcoin wallets or tumblers.

ha def.... i've stated how naive and stupid i was, i have learned my lesson, yes. I only figured they were still there because other people who said they were scammed reported their wallet going to zero almost immediately. This was the first time I ever tried buying Bitcoin and I fucked up. I've had plenty of time to get over the loss though and I've successfully purchased many BTC since then. Just happened to come across something i scribbled down about the site so i was curious and seeing them still sitting there ..i just had to question it.

I used coinbase for awhile and did not have any issues.. I recently deleted my account on there only because I started using circle and it is a much easier process and you can get your BTC instantly with a debit card as soon as you sign up. With coinbase it took awhile from time of sign up until I was given the option of instant buy and I would have to wait up to a week for my coins to show up in my wallet. So I would definitely recommend circle if you are using a bank account and want your coins ASAP. If those things don't matter to you , as NimbleBodhi said localbitcoins.com is best for anonymity it's just a little more work.
