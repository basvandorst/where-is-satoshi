Probably should have said 'before that happens'. Before you have a chance to buy at a lower price, the usd price will bounce back. Note that's not my opinion, more like the most optimistic pov.
It is still a bit odd to see such divergence, usually traders in other markets see the writing on the wall and sell, driving down the price before any arbitrage is necessary. Perhaps it indicates a lack of pro traders on the nz exchanges.
If the nz exchange usually tracks the usd ones, you can certainly expect it to come back into line eventually. Whether that means the usd rate rises or the nzd rate declines is less certain.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:35:08
Doing that is called arbitrage. When there are violent moves the arb can't keep up. The main problem is usually moving/exchanging the fiat currency. In this case converting nzd for usd and the delay in wiring.

Ah, so possible insider trading. Yeah, good Q.  It seems very hard to enforce or prove after the fact.  Almost all big news seems to be traded before it's publicly available.

They could hurt the price, but we could still make transactions. Fees would become more reasonable for those who use it as a currency rather than a get rich quick scheme, so that would be nice.

What was shady? People buying into a thin order book is what I saw. What's to investigate?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:29
Sure. They would probably do it with a hard fork instead. Ln and other 2nd layer tech doesn't strictly need segwit, it just makes things easier.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:48:18
aiui, the fees are the same, only segwit transactions are actually slightly larger, they require an even higher fee.
The "segwit fixes fees" meme relates to the overall fee pressure decreasing when more people start using segwit and so block space pressure decreases.
So the more people use segwit, the lower fees will get for all users, whether they are using segwit for a specific transaction or not.
At least that's the theory.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:40:16
Open a support request, I bet they'll fix it (maybe not right away, but eventually).

It actually makes a perverse sort of sense - give the banks a taste of their own medicine.  Use their "funny money" to buy "real" bitcoin, then default on the "funny" debt, keeping the "real" asset.  Move to Argentina and live like a king.

Thanks for the reminder.  Have been wanting a 4K monitor (cough TV) for a while.  I can't believe how cheap they have become.  Just ordered one.  Never heard of seiki, hope it's not crap.  I got the 10% discount.
Note I couldn't find the bitcoin payment option.  Apparently it was the digital audio cable I had in my cart.  Removed that and was able to purchase the monitor just fine.
No screenshot, you'll just have to trust me.
Edit: Update, it was crap.  I sent it back.  Now I have a big credit at newegg to use up.  It had a couple of problems: It made a noticeable noise, similar to fan noise.  When it passed digital audio from the hdmi input to the coax digital output, it distorted.  You could back off the source to 80% or so and get around it, but it was clearly introducing a loss into what should have been a pure digital pass-through.

I'm on the side of optionality too.
One effect of a viable sidechain ecosystem will be to pressure core devs to respond to pressure from the community.  Their sensible and responsible actions reinforces bitcoin as the "one chain to rule them all."  Those who disagree with what they do can move to a side-chain (at their peril).

Yeah, do *not* use a brainwallet unless you really know what you are doing.  The phrase you pick will probably have insufficient entropy.
Trezor is very good, but it still relies on a paper backup that must be guarded carefully.  But at least that gives you a second copy.  And it's easier and more secure to spend than paper wallet.
I personally do the two copies of a paper wallet thing for long-term storage.  In addition, I keep a "checking account" amount on blockchain.info (with 2FA of course) as well as a "walking aroud money" amount on android bitcoin wallet with very little protection (password on my phone, but not the wallet itself).
Different solutions for different problems / amounts.
edit: there is no such thing as 100% security.  
    The only secure computer is one that is turned off, locked in a safe and buried 20 feet down in a secret location, and I'm not completely confident of that either.

It's simple supply and demand.  Do we really need to review how markets work?  If there isn't enough goxbtc, the price goes up.  If there is too much, the price goes down.
I think a lot of the high risk people will be trading back and forth repeatedly to capitalize on the price swings.  So they may buy and sell the same goxbtc over and over again - to each other, etc.
For every buyer there is a seller, for every seller there is a buyer.  Yada yada yada.
The price does seem a bit inflated at .144 - no doubt due to the lack of supply that has you confused.  But there will always be "enough", it's just a question of what you want to pay.  I'll buy if it goes to .05 (20:1).

1) Withdrawal btc from gox, capture the transaction and alter the txid.  Quickly submit it to network.  If modified transaction is mined, proceed to step 2.  If not, re-deposit btc and repeat until modified transaction is mined.
2) Hacker to mtgox: "I never got my money."
3) mtgox cluebie: "Oh, I see that txid never got mined, OK, will refund your account."  (gox's big mistake, nothing directly to do with blockchain)

I see side chains giving us two great things:
First, we can develop a successor to bitcoin and migrate to it in a leisurely way, taking our existing currency with us. No need to trade on an exchange. No fear of picking the wrong horse. This puts pressure on bitcoin developers to do the right thing and keep people happy.
Secondly, we can add side chains which perform specific niche tasks while still using the same currency as the main network. No fragmenting the monetary base.

A switching power supply is not what you mean.  You mean a dual-power or universal power supply.
Switching power supplies are the norm these days.  They are named because the incoming power is "switched" to a high frequency (300-500hz or so) before being stepped-down to the correct voltage.  By using a higher input frequency, the size of the transformer required can be reduced significantly, saving weight, space, copper.
- 60hz AC input (sine-wave)
- rectify &amp; filter - DC
- switch / invert to 400hz AC (square wave)
- step down transformer to 12V (or whatever) AC, 400hz.
- Rectify &amp; filter &amp; regulate -&gt; 12V DC
It's much more complex and one would think it's not worth it, but it pays off compared to simply stepping down the 60hz input.
Funny story - when I first got my hands on an IBM PC it was a portable and I couldn't get it to work when we got it out of the box.  It took a lot of time to figure out there was a little switch on the back to go between 120 and 240 that came default set to 240 even though it and we were in the US.  First time I had seen that.

@_date: 2014-01-17 21:06:38
In general I agree with what you say.
I'd just quarrel with  "This will affect the price .. minimally".
Even prior to the event, it seems to be affecting price (down almost 5% in the past 24 hours) as speculators guess the future effect and "build it in" to the current price.
I don't think it's likely, but if a single buyer decided to buy it all and cash out, they could drive the exchange price very low.   You could clear bitstamp's entire order book (price = 0) with a sell order of this size.  A rational person wouldn't do that (they'd lose their investment) and even if they did, the price would surely recover quickly (cheap coins for the masses!).  If someone got a really great deal in the auction they might be tempted to sell until they hit the price they paid, depressing the market to that point.
In short, these coins are entering the money supply.  More supply; equal demand = lower price.  The real question is what price will they bring?

I could make the same bet with myself by selling my brk and using it to buy bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-05 05:22:44
No.  Exchanges will always try to find the best price first.  You can't please sellers or buyers by skipping over orders in the book.  You might please the one that got a great deal, but you'll piss off everyone else who got passed over for the same order.
As an example, say we have Joe asking $700 and Jane asking $800.  Now here comes Jake bidding $800.  If you fill Jake's order with Jane's for $800 you just pissed of Joe who was asking only $700.  Sure, Jane is thrilled.  She sold at premium.
Now imagine there are 1000 Joes you just skipped over to fill Jane's order.  Those other 1000 are rightfully waiving pitchforks - as OP is.  Not to mention Jake will be pretty pissed as well when he discovers there were a lot of lower offers.

I'm at the beta stage on a system to monetize online content using bitcoin.  I'd love to get a few bitcoin sites signed up (lookin' at you coindesk, bitcoinity, bitcoin magazine) so we can boot-strap this thing!
For now I include a couple of test publishers to show how it works.
My system is different from others in that it is voluntary.  syndicoin.co (not .com) makes it easy for you to reward the publishers of content you like.  Coin goes directly from your wallet to the publisher's.
I'd love any feedback ... some specific questions:
- The site design is low-fi.  Positive or negative?  Should I get a full-screen picture of happy beautiful people enjoying a sunset on the roof of a loft apartment building in brooklyn?  How about some newsboy clip-art?
- Do any other wallets support BIP70/BIP72 and thus this service?
Here's the text of the site for those who don't want to click through - but please do click through and try out the interactive parts!
Financing online content with bitcoin.
Syndicoin makes micropayments a reality by aggregating small payment requests.
 For consumers
No signup or pre-funding required. As you browse the web, syndicoin keeps a private account of payment requests from participating sites.
When you are ready, visit syndicoin to review and pay for the content you like. Remove items you dislike, then click pay. This will launch your bitcoin wallet where you can review the payment one more time before broadcasting it on the network. By paying for content, you reward publishers and encourage them to rely on direct funding instead of ads.
To try it out, visit test publication 1 and test publication 2.
 For Publishers
No signup required. We never hold your coin and have no record of your payments. Include a small piece of code in your pages and start accepting bitcoin payments for your content. It will not slow down your site's page load time (loads asynchronously) and is very lightweight (less than 1K compressed).
[ code omitted]
Visitors' browsers save payment requests as they surf. Visitors need take no action while browsing.
Visitors will be asked to pay for all the content they have consumed when they visit the Syndicoin site. You can encourage them to do so if you like. Clicking on a bitcoin link in a page using syndicoin will open the syndicoin payment review page.
When they make a payment, the coin will be sent directly from their wallet to the address you specify. If there is only one address, there is no fee - even if there are multiple payments for that address. If syndicoin acts as an aggregator for multiple publishers, a 1% fee is included.
Payment requests are saved for any and all "bitcoin:" links on your page. BIP 21 amounts are accepted in lieu of the data-attribute pricing system illustrated above. A default amount of 1 mBTC is used if neither of the other methods yields a price.
Currency conversion is performed at the syndicoin payment page using BitcoinAverage's 24-hour average. Currency may be any of the fiat currencies supported by BitcoinAverage, BTC (XBT) or bits (micro-bitcoin).
 Other Details
**Can publishers request payment after page-load?**
Yes. Just call the syndicoin javascript API: You could use this to charge by the minute for video, music or web-based games. A call to the js api causes no network activity.
**How do you make money?**
A 1% fee is added to all syndicoin payment requests with more than one output. One-output payment requests are not charged a fee.
**What wallets are supported?**
To use the service, you must use a wallet that supports the relatively recent Bitcoin Payment Protocol (BIP 70).
Syndicoin has been tested with the reference wallet bitcoin core. We have also tested the android app bitcoin-wallet. It does not support the regular payment link. Instead, you must use the "download" link and then open the payment request from your downloaded files. Hopefully bitcoin-wallet will support directly opening the bitcoin payment from the payment page. A bug report has been opened explaining the problem at the heart of this.
Here are some test multi-ouput payment requests: Signed and Unigned. If your wallet opens with a multi-output transaction, it properly handles the format used by syndicoin.
**What browsers are supported?**
All modern javascript-enabled browsers are supported. Some features are used which may not be supported very old browsers:

Just like everyone else, I don't get the goxbtc out unless/until gox makes good.
That's the gamble. But I got them at ten cents on the dollar, so I'm willing to take the risk. Is there still at least a 10% chance gox makes good? I think so.
Btcbuilder holds the goxbtc in their own gox account and releases them to me upon request and contingent on their ability to do so.

The main advantage is convenience - pay for all content consumed in one place, once per month (or any period you like).
It's also more efficient and thus cheaper.  Since all your payments to all participating publishers are paid at once, there is less load on the blockchain.  It makes the miner fee manageable for small amounts.
From the publisher's perspective, it's much easier to implement.  Just include the javascript code on your page with a bitcoin url (either hidden or visible).
There might even be another publisher advantage .. by tracking content consumed and presenting it when the visitor wants to pay for content, you might get a better conversion rate.
The obvious downside for publishers is that it's voluntary - no paywalls or pre-funding.  No guarantees.
I want to make voluntary payments take off by making them super convenient to send and receive.  Publishers can use this and ads in whatever mix makes sense for them.  I'd personally like to see it take off to the point where advertising is not as important.
This certainly uses less bandwidth.

Originally Apple wanted to steer people away from making apps, instead suggesting they do everything using a mobile-optimized web site.  That didn't work partly because HTML5 hadn't come far enough - there wasn't an API to access the camera, for example.
So the apps proliferated into the mess we have today - many of them are little more than wrappers around a web site anyway.
They probably wish they could turn back the clock on HTML5.

Diversification is not such a good thing if you think you can pick a winner.
If I'm betting on a house race and I think I know who is going to win should I place bets to win on all the entries to "diversify"? Now imagine I can bet after the race is 90% run with one horse lapping the rest of the field. Should I still place a bet to win on the  horse? Sure the leader could fall in the final stretch in which case that bet would look smart, but more likely I'm just throwing money at a loser.

Argue if you like, but that is the attack vector as I understand it. These could be very large amounts on multiple accounts.
Edit: from gox's own press release:
"This means that an individual could request bitcoins from an exchange or wallet service, alter the resulting transaction's hash before inclusion in the blockchain, then contact the issuing service while claiming the transaction did not proceed. If the alteration fails, the user can simply send the bitcoins back and try again until successful."

Ah, I misunderstood.  I guess he's mainly referencing the unix "executable bit" which is a key difference in the OS.  If windows sees something that ends with ".exe" it will execute it when clicked.  Not so Linux - here, it must be manually flagged as executable before it is clickable.  So clicking a link on the web and then trying to "open" the file in a file browser will result in an error, even if the downloaded file is a bash script or what have you.


If an application has such a vulnerability it is treated as a serious breach of that executable/data barrier.  On windows it's not really treated as a problem (un-sandboxed word macros were considered a "feature not a bug", activex tried a little harder to vet things, but ultimately failed).




Maybe so, but it's horrible advice and we realize it.  Only for the brave.  In the Microsoft world everyone must be that sort of brave if they want to do something as simple as play an mp3.

I released a new way to tip today - trust-free, registration-free, spam-free, simple and easy.
I think it is the next generation of tipping.
Disadvantages compared to changetip:
 - Requires tipped person publish a bitcoin address.
 - Cannot cheaply handle very small amounts.
 - Requires a wallet that can handle multi-output payment requests.
 - Never holds funds
 - No registration
 - No spam
I posted separately about it here:
I like changetip, but I fear they may run into regulatory trouble.  SyndiCoin tipping should be immune from regulation, since it holds no funds and has no user accounts.
Hopefully bitcoin will be able to scale so it can continue to handle small transactions cheaply.  Hopefully multi-output payment requests will be implemented by more wallets.  Hopefully bitcoin will become the next big thing.  Hopefully the price will go to moon.

But just to continue the theoretical economic argument (assuming space travel were cheap &amp; easy), couldn't you plant a flag on the pile of gold and then sell only what the market would bear?  e.g. sell only for $1000/oz or more.

Just sayin' I like not getting spam.  My background is in anti-spam and bitcoin has always been talked about as a possible solution.  This isn't how it was envisioned to work, but it makes perfect economic sense.  Why send spam when you can make more money directly and skip the sales process?
Sending spam with botnets is similarly a very shady situation with a slim profit margin (think millions of emails sent in the hopes that 1 or 2 my result in a sale).  We've just hit a tipping point where mining is slightly more profitable.
Ideally computers will become secure to the point where assembling a large botnet at all becomes impractical.  Maybe someone will create a "benevolent root kit" that just installs linux on the target &amp; reboots it.

Data (photos, documents, music, etc.) is read and processed by programs (photoshop, word, winamp, etc.).  Everyone should understand this distinction.  Swapping data is like a handshake.  Swapping programs is like unprotected sex.




Most linux users never do anything like that, nor should they.  It is uncommon.  They are habituated to look for software in the distro's walled garden.  Even as an uber linux hacker, I rarely need to install except from the distro's library or the platform's library (pip, cpan, etc.)

A way to interface with that nasty old dollar-based system seamlessly - pay your bills, get paid via direct deposit, etc.
But instead of "holding" dollars (as if that's what a bank does), they are quickly and cheaply exchanged for bitcoin - an audit-able bitcoin address.  Bitreserve - as in, we actually have the reserves to back up your deposits.
So the dollars can actually do the thing people want that's "like bitcoin" - appreciate.  Give them to me raw and wriggling.  Keep nasty stability.

* Content publishers don't usually have much on the page to be concerned with and they're used to loading scripts this way for ads, analytics, discussion or social networks.  This seems like a similar situation.  This system won't be used on a bank or wallet site.
* I want the ability to publish changes.  If someone is worried about it, they can of course copy my javascript to their page and it will probably keep working, though perhaps not - they take on that risk.
* That "10 line script" is actually 63 lines in source form.  It has been minified down to 10 lines, but it's pretty unreadable in that state.

Agreed.  But what does fireproof have to do with theft?
As bitcoin gains adoption, thieves will most certainly look for wallets.  Moreover people will learn to recognize them and might be tempted if they have a high balance.  Do you hide them or put them in a safe?  Both, I suppose.
But back to fireproof - here's a crazy idea - I bet you could create a fireproof wallet with a dot-matrix printer and a sheet of steel.  Your printer might not last long printing on steel, but I bet it would work.  Probably wouldn't make anything QR-scannable out of the box, but would suffice to etch the private key onto the metal in text form.

Reddit is HTML5.  So are most modern sites.  Where do you get information?


Hype is hype.  The reality has been quite successful and the blockchain wallet is just one example of something that wouldn't be possible without it.
Edit: Yes, some "real applications" will always need higher-level access.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:21:26
Yeah, but the oauth provider can be yourself, in which case it's pretty much the same thing.
I don't see what this really has to do with the blockchain.  You could do the same thing with PGP.
Most sites using 3rd party auth count on the 3rd party to do some basic spam control.  On my site, I either do 3rd party auth or captcha to keep out the junk.  Using this system, I could get DDoSed with fake accounts.
But for other use-cases, like hard core crypto and security, this could be great.  But still not better than traditional client digital certificates (i.e. ssh public key auth or browser-based client certificates).
Maybe bitcoin is what will make the general public learn the concept of asymmetric keys.

His last line was something interesting:  "Once you secure my assets, I'm much less worried about my data."  So once we move our money into bitcoin and secure it, there will be less incentive for "identity theft" as such.

Their access only lasts as long as the verified address holds the funds.  So each account has to have a wallet that stores X bitcoins for as long as they want to stay a member.  Two members can't share one address.

I had never heard of Alien Blue, it does appear to be an app, yes.
I like reddit's mobile site OK, though surely it could be improved.  Still better than using the desktop site on mobile.
HTML5 is not just about mobile.
Here's the main booster site:
Google keeps creating these HTML5 tour-de-force sites.  Here's their latest:
But really it isn't so much about extraordinary sites built using every feature in the HTML5 toolkit.  It's more about ordinary sites cherry-picking the features that are useful for what they're doing.  For example, I think gmail uses localstorage to keep copies of the messages so that when you click on them they open instantly instead of having to wait for the server.  Nothing gee-whiz that you'd know was html5, just making things better.  Gmail also uses "desktop notifications" to alert you when you have mail/im even if you aren't on that tab.
I've used the geolocation api to populate a proximity-based search form.  I use localstorage to store trivial user preferences (state of toggles, etc.).  Nice to not have to keep every little session detail on the server in my database.
To me, it's more about progress unhindered by a lengthy standardization process.  In the move from HTML4 to 5, the whole w3c philosophy was changed to allow for more granular improvements.  Small-scope features can be proposed, implemented and released in a relatively short time without waiting for a big "html version".
It's also about acknowledging the "facts on the ground."  html5 is actually a lot less strict and re-allows many things that were forbidden under html4 - html4 attempted to be very strict, removing a lot of features in a "mother knows best" sort of way, even features that were widely used.
Anyway, don't get me started .. too late ;)

Probably shouldn't have said "how it's done" - there are surely various ways to do it.
But when the command finds it's way onto the wire, it must be serialized somehow.  I believe mysql (and others?) use ordinary inline escaping.  They do it correctly and hide it from you so things "just work."
All that happens at the driver level, I agree something is very wrong if an application developer is thinking about such things.

Speculated based on the leaked transaction data to be a bot acting on behalf of Mark or some of his fat-cat associates.  It would place market buy orders on a regular schedule.  It seemed to be part of what caused the wild price increase.
Some say there were no fiat funds to back it, or they weren't on the regular books.  Which means it was pulling bitcoin out without paying for them, gradually making mtgox into a fractional reserve.

Openssl, the encryption system in bitcoin, is from a third-party.  It is the industry standard, but it is old, large, complex and (apparently) riddled with bugs.  We're replacing it with the new light-weight hotness soon.
There is a situation where if fed the wrong input, openssl produces a different result on windows vs. linux.  By exploiting this problem, an attacker could have created a transaction that creates a "parallel universe" blockchain.  People could start spending coins differently within the resulting halves (nobody could spend your coins for you, but someone else might try to double-spend you).
The fix places basic limits on transactions (no strenuous measures), making this malicious transaction illegal - nodes won't relay them and miners won't mine them.  No more parallel universe.
It does shake my confidence a bit, but I am made more confident by the amazing handling of the situation by everyone involved.  These people know what they are doing.  The thing that blows my mind is how the fix (which was public for a long time) didn't reveal the severity or location of the problem.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:34:14
But none of this matters because the fork will take 20 minutes to resolve, one way or another. The loser (core imo) will quickly be as irrelevant as testnet2. Assuming it even comes to that, which I doubt. Just depends how long the holdouts are willing to stick to their guns. Keep in mind the cost.
It's also why payment processors etc. have a say - because they represent users and can decide which version (or require both) is valid.
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:15:55
That is not legit use as I see it. It's another form of spam. Blockchain is not your cloud data store. Store your data somewhere else and put a single hash of it in a single transaction.

I do get that being a mod is a thankless, endless job. And I appreciate you taking the time to talk about it.
 I agree with you until I get to this:


But would you cover an equally big positive story? That's my point; the cherry picking of negative stories which are given an exception to the rules.
I think debate about different ways forward for bitcoin has been stifled and that ultimately causes more forks and hurts bitcoin's viability long term, as good ideas are suppressed.
I won't get into the specifics. I'll just mention that I hold more USD value in BTC than any other coin/asset and I only want the best for it. But I don't like the direction it's going and I don't like the lack of debate about that direction here.

@_date: 2019-04-16 07:37:54
I again appreciate the thoughtful reply. I'll consider being more active here, pointing to good ideas as I see them. To get started:
You brought up big blocks but there are a number of other examples. I think rbf and segwit-as-softfork were bad choices and worse they were done with bad intentions (my opinion only of course).
LN appears to make centralization worse than big blocks do, causing all but the most sophisticated users to seek custodial wallets. Big blocks only cause centralization of mining operations, as Satoshi predicted. LN leads us right back to fractional reserve banking, something bitcoin was meant to avoid.
@_date: 2019-04-16 02:46:35
What am I incorrect about, exactly? I am surprised my comment wasn't removed and my account banned, so I was wrong about that. But I suppose you were referring to something else.

Nod.  I guess I was also forgetting coinbase isn't really an exchange?  The are basically just a BTC store - you buy from &amp; sell to them directly, huh?  No real order book.

Sounds like bad news for the Chinese.  No use for commerce.  Ugh.  Though I suppose this may have the reverse effect psychologically - "if it's banned, then it must be good."
This would fall in the "then they fight you" category.  One step away from "then you win."

Making some assumptions about what you are talking about .. that doesn't seem like the same thing really - if your script sees the price at your trigger and enters a market order, it might be filled at a very different price by the time it hits the books, particularly if it's happening when there is a lot of activity on the exchange.

The fewer bets you make, the better your chances of winning.  
Bet zero times, you have already beaten the odds, go home.
Bet once and you might just come out ahead.  But the chances are slightly against you.  If you win, go home.  If you lose, still go home.
Bet twice and you have just averaged two slight chances against you.  Your overall chance is more likely to be negative.  You probably lost.
.. rinse repeat ..
Play indefinitely = 100% loss.

Sorry for the necro-post.
It's probable I could audit the code - I am no slouch with software.  But even then a subtle weakness is sometimes very hard to spot, if it's written craftily.  It's reassuring to hear you say you've done it - not that I trust a random reddit user obviously, but it's one more data point.  
I'm willing to take it on reputation/faith at this point.
I meant to point out the theoretical difficulty for Joe Plumber to do so.  At some point you have to trust someone.  I worry about Joe buying a cold wallet from somewhere random without even thinking about this type of attack.  "Oh, cool, I never saw a purple one, I want one of those!"  Similar to the 'dancing ponies' malware attack on windows (users will agree to any security dialog so they get to see the dancing ponies promised by the trojan).

Whether one or the other, it's nice to see serious people paying serious attention.  Woo is standing up and saying what he thinks they're worth and why.  And why shouldn't he be conservative?  We don't want to /cause/ a bubble.
I guess he speaks chinese and he seemed to feel the chinese announcement didn't forbid merchants like baidu, good news.

They use a real exchange like bitstamp.  They give you a $-denominated account with them.  The USD can sit there when you're on the sidelines.  Nothing hits your US account.  Technically these people probably should pay short term capital gains tax on those transactions, but many may wait until they actually repatriate the USD.

/me dons amateur lawyer hat.
If what you provide is just software to interface with the relevant systems, I don't see how you would be a money transmitter.  You also wouldn't be storing someone  else's coins which would make people feel safer.
Also if you were open source it would help alleviate security concerns and unleash the "nuclear option" making it much less likely the feds would bother to try to shut you down.
You could even add yourself as an extra output on the bitcoin transaction (which if open source, people could remove, but if it were a small amount, many probably wouldn't bother).  Call it a commission or a tip.  You still wouldn't be a money transmitter, unless simply accepting money is "transmitting" it.

I got a strange timeout trying (unsuccessfully) to remove a limit order.  It worked again the next second.  But looks like no trades  ATM.

This is great because I was just on that article trying to improve it only to find it "locked".  I made a trivial attempt to submit a change anyway and gave up.
Something minor, it sounds like you may rewrite this entire section, but it currently says:
"Bitcoins are stored by associating them with addresses called "wallets"."
I'd say:
"Bitcoins can be kept in digital wallet or printed on paper."
Where we really want to talk about storing them (not in the intro), we could talk about these ways:
- hardware (trezor)
- hot (cell phone, pc, etc.)
- online (like a regular bank)
- cold (internet-disconnected system)
- paper
- brain
- others?

I hear what your saying, but I'm keeping copies simply as a backup. I won't ever take the funds unless the original recipient asks me for help. I'm assuming most people will stick the paper wallet in a drawer somewhere and forget about it. That's a great way to store them. Then when "to the moon", they'll either find that wallet or ask me. If I see one of my backups has been spent, I can discard it. If not I'll just keep it safely in case the recipient needs help.

I'm newly interested in paper wallets, but my security sense tingles when using  third party sites to create them.  We place a lot of trust in the source of the wallet - the creator can keep copies for itself or generate them in a weak way so they can hack them later.
How can we be sure this (or any) source is trustworthy - i.e. they aren't keeping a copy of the private key for themselves?  Seems like the one above and  are pretty reputable and they do all the work in the browser.  But I can't really audit the code myself.
Is there something in the ubuntu software center (I'll trust that) to do the job?  Not a website?
What if I generate a new wallet in bitcoin-qt - could I then create the QR codes myself for it?  Maybe this is the best paranoid path for storing large amounts.

You could call the police or sue them. Neither of these options is typically satisfying.  It is theft and if proven, could result in penalties.  It's hard to prove and hard to capture the culprit when bitcoins and global markets are involved.

I think it's good if the fools get fleeced.  Teach 'em a valuable lesson.  Trezor is a good answer too - pretty much prevents any stupidity.
What you say is true also - there is a place for insured (dare I say fractional) banking where most coin is either in cold storage or invested.

And put those written plans into concrete limit orders.  So you can go to the bathroom without your computer.  If your price is met, your order will happen without your involvement.  How many times I have seen people write "I wanted to buy at __, but by the time I got to my computer the price was back up to __". Let the computer do the work for you.

It's not a problem.  We can just continue to sub-divide whatever coins remain.  If a ship loaded with gold sinks, it just makes the remaining gold that much more valuable.

Speculators make the price more stable, not less. When the sheep stampede for the exits, who picks up the pieces?  The speculators.
Likewise, when there is "irrational exuberance" (again caused by sheep) who is there to sheer them?  The same experienced traders.
Exchange rates between exchanges out of whack?  Traders will arbitrate between them, bringing rates back in line.
Experienced traders like anything that's volatile because it gives them nice swings to profit on.  But their own influence tamps down the volatility.  If they do their job right, they sell at the top (throwing cold water on "panic buying") and buy at the bottom (supporting the price when it gets too low.)
I don't think "pump and dump" means what you think it means.

Soon you will see merchant terminals and parallel support in mobile clients so that bitcoin becomes "tap and pay".  Your client will pass the transaction to the merchant directly (via NFC) and the merchant's terminal will verify it and then push it into the block chain.  So they'll verify the payment before it even hits the block chain.
We aren't there yet, but this is already part of the spec and will become the normal in-person transaction.

You still have no assurance that the keys it produces are secure.  It could be making them from a known (to the developers) random seed or picking them from a small hard-coded set.  Similar to the android PRNG bug.  Being offline in itself is no real assurance.  You need to know how it's producing keys.  That's where open source wins.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:49:01
Sorry it may not be a solid economic argument, more a philosophical one -
I think you have to a world with less growth.  Bitcoin is a catalyst for that sort of move.  People save more, businesses operate on cash instead of credit.  The economy no longer super heated by cheap credit (aka printing money).  And yes, it would be disruptive.  People who cling to the status-quo longest will be the ones hurt the most.
We also have to stop thinking about countries as the drivers.  It's too late for them to control it.  We are individuals acting directly in the world economy.  I can order a case of coffee from the farmer in Argentina.  Or stop drinking coffee because I like my deflationary currency better.  The world is flat.  Governments can be cut out of the loop when they act badly (I'm looking at you China).
The volatility will decrease as the market cap (or whatever you want to call it) increases.  But to a certain extent it won't go away - if there is a war, disaster or just bad policy move in one part of the world, prices would reflect it woldwide.
Edit: First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.  We're in the "then they fight you" stage.

I didn't read the link, but my understanding of BTC contracts is that you take a single satoshi (smallest unit of BTC) and stand in the public square and say "this satoshi is redeemable for X in one year" (for example, one share of stock in company Z).  Then you auction that satoshi on an open market (in exchange for any currency - this is not a BTC excange, but something specific to what you are selling.)  So BTC exchange rates don't enter into it.  You're using the bitcoin blockchain to establish the owner of the contract at time of redemption.
Now that satoshi can be sold to someone else, who can see the redemption claim you have made about it.
