I don’t know anything about trust wallet, but I’ve had mostly a good experience with BRD.  Only complaint is that they never developed a BTG wallet or allowed for withdrawals, like they did with BCH.

There are fees associated with every purchase.  Only way to get around that is to buy from a private party, and even then, good luck getting “market value.”  Did you expect a business to perform a service for you for free?

These people need to have a better answer to “what is the intrinsic value of bitcoin” since it always seems to make them stumble and it’s the biggest question that skeptics have.

You contradicted yourself at the start.  “I can afford to lose this” then”wait, I don’t WANT to lose this!”.  You convinced yourself you were okay with investing when you clearly weren’t.  
If you decide to hold some BTC again, set a reminder on your phone for 6 months to a year and check again.  If you need the money before that time, you have no business “investing” in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:08:02
If you are unable to develop your own strategy, here are some very loose guidelines for you.  If it’s below 40k by the end of the year, hold.  If it is above, sell.  If you hold at the end of the year, sell for sure the following December.  Rebuy when price lowers.
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:09:24

Very informative.  The detailed information regarding your calculations are eye opening.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:24:30
How long do you plan on staying in?  So you think BTC will be worth more by that time?  If so, go ahead and buy... it’s very difficult to time the market.  It sounds like you are a knee jerk reactor... I strongly suggest that you set a date when you buy and fully commit to not selling before that date.
