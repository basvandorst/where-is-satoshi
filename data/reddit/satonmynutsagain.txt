Sigh. Again, I'm NOT just talking about the ASICs. Look around the perimeter of the board that is what I'm talking about. There's no way that's only a 4-layer board with almost zero routing on the top side. And yes you most certainly do need proper power planes here, that would be just insane to try and do otherwise. 
I don't know why anyone would be so hung up on the layer count - this is a very boring topic! 


This isn't meant to be a cosmetically realistic model, the parts are just shown so you can see the mechanical outline. That's useful for thinking about clearances - how it will fit in the box, airflow etc. So those funny looking things are electrolytic caps, but they just get drawn as rectangular for simplicity. Notice there is not a single round thing pictured on this PCB, even though those big blocks near the power supplies obviously must be electrolytics. It's just a very simple rendering.

Yep. Barnhardt is a strange bird to say the least... "the power of Christ compels her".
However, she is very sharp - both a student of history and intimately familiar with the commodities trade. She chose to shut down her own firm following MF Global's collapse, citing a total absence of morals and regulatory integrity that had made it impossible for her to even guarantee her own customers' positions. She says paper markets are entirely predicated on ethics and the rule of law, and once that fails you unequivocally must get out.
I'm atheist myself, but I feel like her fanatic commitment to Christian morals gives her significant credibility in this situation.

Mises' regression theorem has always bothered me. I don't even see how it applies to gold, since gold has great monetary properties but isn't useful for much else. Austrians will point to its "ornamental" uses in support of the regression theory... but I submit that those are also a flavor of money. Jewelry *does* have the properties of a store of value and medium of exchange, albeit not quite as nice as when the gold is pressed into identifiable bullion. The fact that gold also satisfies some people's desire to *display* their wealth is just a bonus feature.

Of course it's bad communication. You are entitled to a proper explanation.
But did they not give you the option to withdraw USD?


Then do it.
If you want your money now, then somebody has to pay the USD/CAD exchange fee. What you need to read between the lines here is that they're waiting for someone else to deposit CAD so that they don't have to take the 2% haircut. I do not object to this in principle, but it should be communicated that this is their policy.
This will be a growing problem for Mt Gox because they are always going to have a surplus/deficit in certain currencies based on aggregate demand for one or another. They need to manage expectations better, and make it clear that they can only promise funds to be available in USD if that is the case.

As I was saying all investment is speculative. 
I can answer your question but first we'd have to agree what we're measuring performance against. I like to use oil, since that's the master resource which goes into everything we consume. This takes inflation out of the picture since it's a total wildcard. 
In those terms, I would say that physical gold is the least speculative play. You have no counterparty risk, and the long term prices are closely related by the laws of nature. Any surprises by central planners will usually work in your favor, whereas if nothing unexpected happens you are most likely to just retain value.
These are very bizarre times we live in, where government debt is considered a "sure thing" while commodities are "speculative". The absurdity of it kinda make my head spin.

I was talking about any corporation with stock. That could be anything from a one man startup to a fortune-500.
But after noodling the general concept of "colored coins" for a few hours here, I can think of all sorts of applications for this. Just for starters how about this:
Right now mtgox provides three functions: 1) letting you keep a balance of cash/btc, and 2) letting you trade them, and 3) letting you desposit/withdraw them.
With colored coins you can decouple all of these. We would create colored coins representing USD redeemable by counterpary xyz. Now function  is no longer needed because your USD balance is tracked in the blockchain.
And function  no longer requires a middleman to facilitate the exchange. You only need an order matching system, but they do not even have to handle and BTC/USD themselves (how they get revenue is a question I'm not sure of).
And function  becomes just for USD in/out. And now it doesn't even have to be the same entity that handles  You could have any number of "USDcoin" types corresponding to different parties willing to trade USD. A cash exchange then has a very simple business because he's not even exposed to the BTC exchange rate.
What's most fascinating here is that you don't have to keep USD/BTC at an exchange in order to trade them. You obviously have the counterparty risk that you're holding backed-by-USD colored coins, but that's not worse than being exposed to a bank-like-account.

The marginal cost may be low but you still have to recover the NRE one way or another. If the quantity you expect to sell goes up then the price on something like this can go down quite a lot. In other words if the manufacturer sense that there is far more demand at a lower price, then he may lower it substantially. This is not the case with all goods - for example laptops have relatively small gross margins so even if you know you can sell more at a lower price, it doesn't mean you can make money dropping the price.
What you're seeing here is really an edge case where the NRE might be a couple $M, but your per part price is only $20. That doesn't mean you can sell them for $60 and make money though, if there's only a market for 1,000 chips. You'd never recover your sunk cost.
At the end of the day what matters is the value to the customer, and that is strictly $/Gh/s, a simple commodity. So it makes sense that twice the Gh would sell for barely less than twice the price, otherwise somebody would just buy two of the little ones.

It's called "layering". You accumulate most of your position at a low price, then place a series of large bids each below the market price, which don't actually get filled, to push up the price. This forces other buyers to pay more because they know their order will never get filled if they're behind you.

Are we going to need banks to handle bitcoin micropayments? I know the protocol can handle very small fractions but it is too slow for an application like this. You need an intermediary to hold a small balance for you that can be rapidly debited (eg in 1 RTT, using a UDP packet).
Another use for this would be a p2p service where you get paid BTC for uploading.

It only claims to detect the most *common* counterfeits. Typically bronze might be used, which would make the coin either too big or too light.


This is correct - tungsten plus a teensy bit of something heavier can match gold perfectly. Even just Tungsten by itself is super close. It would fool the fisch but not an ultrasound - even if you match the density perfectly, the velocity of sound would be way different.


Correct. That's why people should stick to 1oz coins. Much harder to fake.

You misunderstand me. He's not trying to turn a real profit. He's only trying to buy back a larger number of BTCs than he sold the day before, but he doesn't care if the total value repurchased is less! He's not just selling all by himself, he'll create a panic to push down the price. Yes I do think outsiders will participate.
If you don't think this would ever happen then fine, let's agree to disagree. I'm in cash now, obviously, and I've got my popcorn. 


Well sure he could do that and then all bets are off, but he could go to prison. Supposing he actually delivers, how would that work? That's what I'm getting at here.
He has panache. He tells his greedy clients right to their faces that he's going to loot them (arr he's a pirate!), but he wants to see if he can actually deliver on the promised return while still screwing them over because he crashed the currency. 
If he delivers on his promise as stated, then they can't sue him. That's the point I think.

I see you are attempting to withdraw CAD.
I presume what is going on here is that gox keeps multiple bank accounts in various currencies. That allows you to buy/sell BTC in your local currency without paying a fiat exchange rate.
But if CAD is not very popular among their users, they might not have a lot sitting in the account ready for immediate withdrawal. It doesn't mean they're insolvent or defaulting on your balance. They will probably tell you you have to withdraw in USD because that's what other exchange users are selling.
Let us know how this resolves. I would be irritated too if I got an email like that, but I suspect there was more to this discussion which you chose to omit. What exactly was your original inquiry and did they say anything before this or give you another option to withdraw?
@_date: 2012-08-20 18:21:03


Of course, that's the whole point. I'm not sure if you understand the mechanics of a market? 
Pirate IS the bidder here, buying up some fraction of what's being dumped while everyone else would be selling. He's not buying because he wants to own BTC, he's buying them to pay back his clients. He's paying them BTC, not USD - perhaps that's the point you're missing here.
He wants the price to keep falling (precisely NOT the reason anyone would normally buy). That's the whole trick - it devalues his liability to his clients.

If he were the ONLY big player then he would probably lose some money to the extent that others choose to take profits and walk away, but certainly not 99.9% of it!
You are supposing that all those people who sold him bitcoin on the way up to $500 would not be willing to buy it back at any lower price except the $8 where it started, nor would anyone else choose to enter the market as he liquidates. That is unrealistic, but again, the whole premise of ONE big player is extremely stupid. If you had a hundred people investing a *total* of $1B worth, and buying/selling at staggered times, then the price would be perfectly sustainable.
The point is: OP is wrong, because the trading of currencies is absolutely NO different than trading of goods and services.  Bitcoin can accommodate any amount of investment. It does not matter what the size of the "economy" is (presuming what he meant by that is uses besides store-of-value).

Imagine there is some information which is very hard to create, but there is some other representation of it that you can share to demonstrate that you do in fact have said information. A one way function, if you will, where you can turn your information into another form that others can verify.
Well, that's what a rendering like this shows someone who understands board layout. 
It shows me that they are far beyond prototyping stage and have completed the design of a mass-producible PCB in its final form factor. It means they've surely taped out their first run of the ASIC, since they would not proceed to this stage of board layout until after testing the chip in an evaluation board. But it is not nearly enough for me to just go steal the design and make it myself.
I don't know why I'm wasting my time explaining this to you. A person who doesn't even realize how ignorant he is is truly the worst kind of stupid anyone can be.

The coins had higher melt value than their face value. If you spent them at face you were losing several $USD per coin - silver was what, about $8/oz at that time? It was never their intent to make something with significant real value that would pass for a fiat coin having a small fraction of that value. That would be downright retarded, but it's what the feds argued they were doing.

"backed by" refers to some credible guarantee of redeemability. For example, the US government used to say that a $1 note was backed by $1 of silver (then defined as  0.7736 troy ounces of the metal). Or that dollars were redeemable at $35 per ounce of gold. That meant you could go to a bank and trade them for such a quantity of metal. Today, the USD is backed by... the USD. A very peculiar situation which should alarm any thinking person.
Bitcoin is not backed by anything either, but this is a *good* thing because unlike the USD it is an intrinsically scarce commodity. Similarly, you might hold gold because it will always be an ounce of SCARCE gold *despite the failure of any counterparty to perform*.
To say that bitcoin is "backed by" math is stupid. You can't trade your bitcoin for some "math". You trade it for goods and services in the open market. It is valued for its own properties (intrinsic value) as opposed to someone's promise (extrinsic value).
TLDR: bitcoin is like gold: backed by nothing/nobody. And that's a GOOD thing.

It's a balance between teasing and managing expectations. Also the boards they have at this stage might look a little sloppy due to rework - you don't really want everyone to see how the sausage is made.
Most hardware makers don't post board photos before something ships. In this case I think they just feel compelled to release *something* in light of the delays. But as I mentioned the board is not really the hard part - the real potential for delays would be in the ASIC bringup, as a silicon bug could mean having to fabricate another chip. The rendering is however evidence that everything is real and quite far along.

You are speculating not only on the strength of the dollar, but also the future solvency of your counterparty. Neither is assured and in fact under present conditions I would consider both of those to be *high* risks.

Presume I would wait until they ship and that the specs are confirmed.... I'm aware of the skepticism, but I do have some logic design experience myself and I don't see how anyone can say these numbers are implausible without having proprietary knowledge of the implementation.
I think I answered my own question here which is that electricity is de minimis compared to the capital cost, such that I should not do much worse than someone who is paying, say, half as much for electricity. 
I'm just wondering if there's anything I'm missing in this analysis.

Yes I conceded that is not certain. But it strongly suggests that they have already completed the first tape-out at least, since your first chips typically would be tested in an evaluation board which would not look at all like this. That board would be much larger and have test sockets for the ASIC, and all kinds of test points, and it would probably not include much of the ancillary stuff like the host SOC, power supplies etc. Let alone sockets for all eight ASICs, with proper thermal and EMI considerations and everything. 
In other words, nobody would design a board like this if they didn't have the chips to put on it.


A month or two maybe, but certainly not years. They've already done an FPGA with essentially similar technology, so there is not that sort of design risk. Worst case they goofed something and have to fab another revision of the chip, but that's fixing a bug not starting over.

It's cool to downvote if I'm wrong, but I would benefit from some explanation.

Yes, he may be doing it using Gox's API although I don't know how fast it is. The question is, would he have time to respond before the trade is even fully processed by MtGox. Of course he could if they were fairly small trades *approaching* his wall, but if there were a big sell order I would expect it to eat into his wall before he has a chance to withdraw the order. 
This assumes MtGox is being fair and is not secretly allowing anyone preferential access to the platform.
Or he just is confident that his order is much larger than anyone else could put a dent in with one trade. At $400K he is probably right. 
Worst case he buys some bitcoin... not the end of the world.

The *premise* of the question means the thing that is assumed. "a basis, stated or assumed, on which reasoning proceeds."
The question was what input costs are necessary to be competitive *supposing* that the product ships and mining is still profitable. 
I fully acknowledge that the specs are tentative and that the product may or may not ship. We seem to be in violent agreement on this, but it simply wasn't what I was asking about.

Yes the mint guarantees the content, but you can also verify it yourself.  You can measure weight and dimensions, specific gravity, do an acid test, ultrasonic test, x-ray fluorescence, or even grind the surface or cut it in half to look for a fake core. 
With a physical bitcoin you can confirm it has value when you receive it, but you can't be assured that the value won't be revoked by the issuer while it is in your possession. 
That's the difference - a physical bitcoin more like GLD, whereas an electronic bitcoin is more like physical gold.

Ah, thank you! I found this discussion which is exactly what I'm after: 
And my question about the transaction mechanism is answered. This is awesome.
"People having coins of different colors can exchange them securely via a simple bitcoin transaction which would be atomic. 
E.g. one person gives 1 red coin and gets 5 blue coins, other person gives 5 blue coins and gets 1 red coins, they construct a transaction, sign it, and once it is in blockchain trade is done. (If one person signs but other doesn't transaction would be invalid. If there is a double-spend, it would also invalidate whole txn. So trade transactions are in fact more secure than accepting bitcoins.)
So what's left is order matching logic, i.e. allowing person which is willing to trade red coins for blue coins to find a person who wants the opposite.
This is fairly simple to implement and straightforward.
@_date: 2012-09-26 05:12:25


I know. That was exactly my point. Synchronous serial == very little bandwidth. Just three or four traces. But that's just the communication between the ASICs and the host, there is still a lot of other stuff here! 


Um. That's exactly what I said: **"The ASICs I presume would communicate with synchronous serial."** That's why I said this is probably 6 layers as opposed to more.
But you still need at least six layers to do what is shown here. It's not just about bus widths. There's very little space between parts here so you can route almost nothing on the top layer. There's plenty of stuff here besides the ASICs, and you need full power planes internally for low EMI. This is still a high-speed board even if there's relatively little interconnecting, so you can't just snake your power rails all over the place to make room.
It could be done with four layers but you would need a sparser board to allow some traces to be routed on the top layer. I can tell this is not a four layer board, because if it were there would have to be a lot more routing visible on the bottom layer. See how the chips on the top side do have signals coming out of them but they just pop right into vias? But you don't see that many corresponding traces on the bottom side. They can't all be power, so that means there are internal signal routing layers. Again I'm not talking about the ASICs but all the other stuff on here. (presumably an ARM SOC and some memory)
Also realize that the cost difference between 4 and 6 layers is not a big deal when you're talking about a low volume, high priced product like this. It is much more economical in that case to just have a couple more layers than to spend all the extra time on board layout, possibly failing EMI, etc. It is quite a small board here so we're only talking maybe $2.

If you have no background in EE it would take me a very long time to explain to you how to tell the difference between a concept drawing and a professionally laid out board. Do you understand that circuit boards are actually designed by human beings who know what a real board looks like because they make real boards? They aren't just squiggly lines and blocks to me, I can tell what nearly all of those parts actually are based on shape, placement, and the appearance of nearby traces. I can furthermore tell that this is not strictly a lab prototype but is actually designed for production and regulatory compliance. There is a TON of information here.
You could call a PCB manufacturer and have this board fabricated in 24 hours. Stuffed with parts in another week. It's therefore no less convincing to me than a physical board in my hand.
As to how far along they are in bringing up their chip, debugging the software etc - that is not shown here, but it certainly does evidence that a mass producible board design exists.

Manipulation trying to drive down the price.
For several months while bitcoin crept up to $12+, there were *bid* walls. Most of us believe this was Pirate manipulating the market.
After he announced that his ponzi fund was closing, the price dropped. I for one believe that it will drop much further from here, because I think he intends to buy back a lot of bitcoins dirt cheap in order to reimburse his clients (or just for himself, who knows).
One interesting difference is that on the way up, he used very obvious, tall bid walls. Like a single step up of $200K, and then maybe one more at a $1 lower price. 
But now he is stairstepping the asks. I believe the reason for this is that first he needs to make the price STOP before he can turn it around. $10 is obviously a key psychological level which he needs to flip from a support level into a resistance level. Once that happens, then he will try to cause a panic using a taller ask wall closer to the market clearing price.
It's sort of like "putting on the brakes", where he is trying to suppress the upward momentum that had been previously built up. He doesn't want to do one big ask wall because people will trade into it and use up his capital prematurely. If he is successful and the price does start to decline, then he will switch to more concentrated ask walls.

It's not so much where it bottoms out, as the *rate* of decline multiplied by the volume that he manages to trade each day. The "interest" in BTC that he generates for his clients comes from the decrease in value between paying back one client to the next over the course of the week.

THAT IS NOT TRUE. In fact this is the single most important distinguishing feature between bitcoin and banking, and the author got it completely wrong. Furthermore, NO commodity form of money requires "spaces to host transactions" - people simply exchange them.
I'm sorry you still don't understand the difference between transacting in bitcoin, versus allowing a third party to hold a balance of bitcoins on your behalf for the purpose of BTC/USD trading.


You really really don't get it. Bitcoin does not promise or even attempt to hold its value against anything else, to generate a return, or even to maintain any degree of stability. It is, by design, a currency that is valued only by the marketplace.

There is an interesting property that people historically have preferred for commodity money to have, and that is that it is found in somewhat even distribution among the people which use it.
To make a silly example, North Americans would never use penguin beaks as money because they are hard to find here, and this would make the Antarcticans very wealthy and us very poor. 
One of the reasons gold was preferred for thousands of years is because it is found in many places and can be obtained with nothing but basic tools and human labor (this obviously is less true today now that we have mined all the easy stuff that was on the surface).
It is one of the reasons that platinum and palladium aren't widely recognized as a store of value... because they are only found in a couple of places. If we were to use platinum as money then it would make those few places like South Africa very wealthy at the expense of everyone else. (Identifiability is the another problem with Pt/Pd)
One of the features cleverly designed into bitcoin is that anyone can mine it. But as the mining rigs become more specialized, it does become less egalitarian in that regard. I would argue that a little capital outlay for an FPGA is not that unfair in the grand scheme of things - access to cheap electricity is a far more unfair issue since that excludes many people just by where they live.
It is good for bitcoin mining to be as accessible as possible, but optimization is obviously going to continue to be the objective and there's nothing wrong with that. Where I would say we have a problem is if/when people find ways to monopolize mining, eg by patenting the best mining techniques.

Well that's where the "managing expectations" comes in.

EDIT: also what kind of pinouts does it have? I would think it is mostly power pins with not much else but an SPI port for control. Is that true? Would be kind of peculiar for any IC and I'm just wondering if this caused any special design challenges (i.e. very high power dissipation per die area).

This is an issue of semantics but I think it is very important. People who understand the word "hub" from other contexts would think you are talking about some element of the architecture that is somehow involved in effecting bitcoin transactions *in general*. That is *not* how bitcoin works and it is not what mtgox does. 
They are only a place to trade BTC for USD, and as such, a sort of bank which can hold either on deposit for you. The entity responsible for your deposits was robbed - it was not any failure of the bitcoin system. You do NOT have to keep your bitcoins in someone else's bank, and indeed you should not except for as long as it takes you to do your currency exchange.

10x is in the ballpark as far as power consumption per GH: 
"The results indicate that on average FPGAs consume 12 times more dynamic power than ASICs when the circuits contain only logic. [...] When we consider designs that include hard blocks such as DSP blocks and memory blocks, we observe that the gap is 12, 9.2 and 9.0 times for the cases when multipliers, memories and both memories and multipliers are used, respectively."
As for performance per unit price, that is impossible to say without specifying how many ASICs you are going to produce, and knowing the die size, process, packaging to be used and actually getting it all priced out. R&amp;D cost alone is a few million just to make the first piece, then you have to make a few hundred thousand before the unit price even gets cheap.

Isn't he paying them back in BTC? The price will only go down if his clients choose to convert to USD. The BTC are being transferred from a concentrated position which can really move the market into many individual hands - that should improve price stability.
If anything I would think a *default* would drop the price - fraud in general just tends to make people skiddish. If he absconds with the funds then I would be concerned about him deciding one day to sell it all in one go.
I don't really understand what he's doing though, to be honest.

Of course there are ways to prevent and resolve a dispute, but that is a cost of doing business that falls almost entirely on the merchant. Address verification helps a lot, to the point that it's usually sufficient when shipping low value stuff within the US, but it is not foolproof. For example kids ordering stuff on their parent's card without permission, then lying that never did it or received the product. Yes if a merchant followed the guidelines he could potentially get a favorable resolution by disputing such a chargeback, but that takes time (i.e. $) to do.
The problem is now you introduce a bitcoin rebate into the mix and that is a much bigger incentive for someone to commit fraud. Say your nincompoop kid wants some ecstasy but he doesn't have any cash. Well all he has to do is buy a stereo from bitcoinrebatestore.com on his mom's stolen card, collect the rebate and convert directly to drugs. The stereo and getting the USD refunded are someone else's problem, the bitcoin is long gone as well as return/handling costs, and everyone else has to spend a few hours sorting it out.

Nope. I have been thinking about this recently... I used to look at Bitcoin's market cap as an indicator that the currency is undervalued, but the more I think about it the more I realize how meaningless it really is.
It's not like all that value is available to be "withdrawn". Just looking at the market depth on MTGOX right now, if just $2,000,000 were cashed in against the present bids, the price of bitcoin would crash down to $0.60.  Same goes for upside BTW, it takes very little trading to move the price relative to market cap.
Understanding the nature of liquidity is the key to realizing how *any* market can experience wild swings. The price is set only by the people who are actually trading it.
Now this is somewhat in contrast to an income generating asset like a stock, where you will often have strong support/resistance outside of its recent trading range. There you have a return on investment calculation you can do which tells you what the total market cap ought to be. As a simplified example, if there are other investments you can make which you expect to return 5%/annum (1/20th principal), then paying more than 20 times future earnings for a stock would be expensive. Another way to look at it is that the market cap of a stock is roughly what an acquirer could reasonably be expected to pay to buy the whole company.
With a commodity currency it is different because the thing itself is used as a store of value. There is no "right" price for bitcoin, and therefore no magical levels of extreme buyer support. So there is no way to say how much value is really in it. All we can say is what a given number of bitcoins could be bought or sold for based on presently visible liquidity.

That Jefferson quote is fake.  
@_date: 2012-08-06 19:01:55
It's not "getting rid of everything else" that makes it fast. 
What makes it fast is that when you implement certain simple but computationally intensive task in logic, they can be done stupidly fast compared to software. 
Your computer does arithmetic like "add", "multiply", "shift"... and several of these little operations have to be done sequentially in order to calculate a hash. What makes a computer versatile as that these kind of "primitive" operations are all you need to run any kind of program, but they're not perfectly optimal for anything.
An ASIC on the other hand could be designed sort of like a processor that has but one instruction: "calculate hash", which does everything in perhaps ONE step. Then you can even run many of these units in parallel on the same chip for a huge amount of hashing power compared to what a CPU does with the same amount of silicon.
Separate from the ASIC would be a conventional processor that just does stuff like telling the ASIC what to do, moving data around, and reporting the results.

The theory is that once Bitcoin is established, the "network effect" should discourage competition. I.e. anyone could make another crypto-currency, but like bitcoin, it will have to start with zero value - what will be the incentive to mine the competing currency if nobody is using it yet? That may be an even bigger chicken/egg obstacle than bitcoin started with, since the new currency would not be competing with inferior fiat money, but with an established cryptocurrency that already works. 
In the open source world there is a tendency for competition to be negligible where an idea has already been competently executed. For example how many new open source kernels have gained traction since Linux became popular? There is little interest in developing a new one since any developer can accomplish far more by building on what exists.
Now with crypto money there is the special incentive that the founders can mine the easy coins before the value rises. I'm fine with rewarding the founders this *first* time, but I don't want to keep paying that bounty every time someone tries to launch a competitor.

You can't dismiss inflation just by acknowledging it. That is THE speculative component of holding government debt. Since you have no idea how the fed will act, and since their actions affect the value of the currency more directly than anything else, I would argue that government bonds are the mother of all speculative investments!
@_date: 2012-07-20 06:54:41
Liquidity is the ability to trade an asset quickly at a known market price. Eg land is very illiquid because it can take a long time to find a buyer at the price you want. Gold is very liquid because it's a big market where everyone knows the price and lots of people trade it.
Here, bitcoin's liquidity is poor if it weren't for those buy/sell walls. Basically they are faking the behavior of a stable market by confining the price to a narrow range. Otherwise relatively small trades would move the price past those points.

Yes and no. If you are with a credit union and your small bank alone fails, then sure FDIC insures you. However if one of the large banks fail, the FDIC would have to be bailed out by the Fed through another massive round of inflation - probably killing the dollar as a consequence. So you might get your dollars out but they'll be worthless.
Besides tiny credit unions there are now just *four* TBTF banks: 
Consider that in the old days, a run on the bank meant that people would go there to withdraw real gold and silver. But today there is no backing to the dollar whatsoever, nor indeed ANY national currency. So we can't even have a proper run on the banks in the conventional sense. Interesting times.
@_date: 2012-07-04 20:12:04
No, I meant that if I sell you a *physical* gold/silver coin, I can not revoke its value later.
Bitcoin and precious metals have many properties in common but this is a key difference. They're actually the exact opposite in respect to physical vs electronic.
A bitcoin's value is properly intrinsic only when in its *electronic* form, because only then can you be certain that you are the sole key holder. It's impossible to produce a physical coin without introducing the risk that the issuer could defraud you. The physical coin depends on a promise, whereas electronic btc does not.
By contrast, the value of silver is intrinsic only when in its *physical* form. Anything electronic constitutes a promise to deliver value, not the value itself.

Agree. Maybe a simple printed handout explaining the benefits to their business and how to get started? We could have a campaign to pitch it person, give a demo, and answer their questions.
One problem is I think most PM dealers want to hedge their inventory with futures contracts. I.e. when they sell some physical gold they will simultaneously buy the same amount at the same spot price, such that they earn their markup without having to worry about if gold might be way down at that time of sale. 
This is cumbersome with bitcoin since there is no electronic bitcoin/gold market - you are asking them either to become bitcoin speculators by holding a bitcoin balance, or to have to deal with constantly exchanging BTC/USD so they can hedge. Maybe there could be an iphone app for PM dealers to automate it all, including real time quoting of the metal in BTC based on market prices for both?
I think some would be willing to do it, but only with pretty large buy/sell spreads to cover the extra effort and to buffer them from the volatility of BTC.

Yes I know. I'm not suggesting the share value would be intrinsic to the colored coin, as it is with BTC proper.

@_date: 2012-08-02 19:53:21
I don't think you understand what intrinsic value means.  
Bitcoin has intrinsic value in exactly the same way as gold. This refers to the value of the commodity itself, as opposed *extrinsic value* which is typically a denomination printed on it indicating what it may be redeemed for from a *counterparty*.
Bitcoin and gold are both commodity money with very similar properties. Just because bitcoin is comprised of information as opposed to a collection of particles does not mean it has no intrinsic value.

The orange line is people who want to buy, and the blue line is people who want to sell. 
At high prices there are more people willing to sell, and at low prices there are more people willing to buy.
The numbers on the Y axis indicate the amount of $ or BTC one would have to buy/sell in order to fill all the orders up to a given level.
Where the lines meet is where trades are occurring. The green squiggle shows the movement of this price over time.
The big step-up in the graph at $9 is, we think, someone manipulating the market by "layering". He puts a buy order in just below where bitcoin is trading, but he doesn't actually intend to buy that much. It can cause other traders to engage in "panic buying" where they are forced to pay a high price because they think they won't get any if they're behind his order. During this wave of panic buying the price will rise and the manipulator will sell. Once he's out, eventually the panic buyers subside and then the price falls fast.

Around the 8 ASICS is a square outline, and there are two mounting holes on either side of it. This tells me that there is a single heatsink unit, probably including a fan, which would mount over all the chips. 
From a thermal standpoint it looks good - you can see they also kept the high-profile parts away from that area to allow airflow into the heat sink.
...and I'm pretty sure it is a six or eight layer board. 
It can't be less. A four layer board would no way have enough room on the top side to route much of anything because of how densely the components are packed. You can't do squat here with just one signal layer.
And it's very unlikely to be ten or more layers since there probably aren't a lot of wide busses and such that need to be routed. The ASICs I presume would communicate with synchronous serial. So I'm going to say six most likely, and only eight if they were not feeling very cost constrained and wanted to get it done super fast.

The creditor would get the collateral and take any loss, if those were the agreed terms. In saner times, a home mortgage required a substantial downpayment. This ensures that the creditor has some collateral, and the debtor had the incentive to perform.
It all got out of hand with policies to reduce interest rates and push debt onto unreliable borrowers, not to mention tax incentives which punish renters. All of this inflates home prices by creating fake affordability. It's not the homeowner's fault - he needs a place to live, but is forced to play in a throughly distorted market.
