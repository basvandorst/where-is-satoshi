Give me a date please ;) - but seriously, this is like saying the internet will go away. Bitcoin will never hit zero because at the **very least a bitcoin is better than standing in line at 7-11 trying to moneygram** somewhere, so this is the lowest level in my mind, 1btc to $1 USD

If a resteraunt can deny smokers, or people with no shirts, ebay can deny you from selling whatever crap they don't want on their site. It's a free country. This is quite hilarious. bitcoin users on this site, selling bitcoin "rigs", are *barely* customers, they are using ebay for all the heavy lifting.  They are a business, they can do whatever they want.

You are naive thinking that someone who essentially created a system where you can "print your own money" is not capable of any misdeeds or cashing out.

We shouldn't have to pay anymore taxes on a P2P currency, it should stay unregulated.
I think the beauty of bitcoin is that it's not regulated.  It's regulated by math, right.  
We pay taxes out the ass on everything right now, and major corporations jump hoops to launder/transfer their money all around the world and start companies in 4,000 miles away to avoid taxes.

@_date: 2013-10-03 07:09:21
I don't think the poster gets the system of a deflationary, somewhat finite currency.
If bitcoins disappear out of circulation, this should raise the value of everyone elses bitcoin, because it makes it scarce, and more valuable.  In theory.
But part of the "intrinsic value" of the bitcoin was that it could be used "anonymously" on this drug market.  Now that the market is gone, a lot of people may no longer value the coin, but hopefully enough people use it now for things other than drugs.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:02:12
Well if the cyber christ comes and the bitcoin jumps to $1,000 (or a mil) a coin, it will be worth more. Or maybe re-invest the .01 a week you make at btct.co and make some weekly dividends off it.

Most people are used to money systems lacking equality.
Yeah, most people got used to the NAZIs.
The only barrier to mining is money, most traditional forms of advancement involve nepotism.
"Nepotism" - what do you call the giant waiting lists and a few sparce people getting their hands on the rigs.
ASICs are useful for mining Bitcoin and that's it. Miners had to invest that money without being guaranteed any return.
So far we think they are only useful for mining, but they could be re-purposed to crack other code/passwords

2011 Bitcoin forums said there are something like 650,000 bitcoin users.  Is this number not accurate?  If so I'll delete/edit the post!!

Maybe they are mining with it at their facility, because its more profitable than to give it to you to print your own money in your bedroom.

Yes, you can bolt it down from the back or bottom.  This was bolted to the table, and was VERY solid.  It may look plastic, but it was powder coat painted heavy duty steel, like you would feel on a gov utility box, had a solid feel like it would be difficult to rip off and run away with.

Hoarder is like a unique term to bitcoin... it used to be called "rich people saving their money".  To think that "hoarders" should spend their money for the benefit of everyone is flawed and will never happen.

It is legit, this is called the brain wallet.

Ok, well it's really swell that people seem to know what he would do and no one has met him... but enough diversion from my main intent.  How difficult would it be to create a ticker to indicate when he begins to sell or to let others know?  Thanks.

This is hillarious.
When the hell did a company ever require you to multiply PI or 0.00136 or whatever time your order number to get an approximate date on shipping?

Do you fall under the "people profiteering off large scale expensive mining rigs" category Mr.Butterfly?

Wow, paypal taking a LOW BLOW with this survey!  Are they on the run ;) or just getting cocky?

What if there is a script that is pre-set to sell all the coins off at once.

If you mine through command a command line like terminal you may get 20% more megahash per second.  I went up 25 mgh/s in terminal.

Where can I buy this?!?
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:48:08
Haha touche - but I mean a gamification process for people with lots of money to systematically pay off the debt.. Wasn't the greenback a "non debt backed" dollar?
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:17:37
But is it still an ATM if I can't get cash out... isn't that the point?
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:21:41
Thanks Frank you are such an amazing human being. By any chance do you work at BFL?
I wish I had a heart like you, and had an extra $300,000 laying around.

He's a lot better speaker than the Willywonkavoz twins and should have had this guy at the convention.

Is your caps lock broken?
If he sells them for pennies a coin on multiple exchanges, what is stopping him.  
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:04:38
2 coins or 2 million...? Don't you think he would have at least created a few million for experimental purposes to test the load

The photos are all cropped the same way BFL crops their "shipped jalapenos" wonder if it's the scammers same photographer/photoshop artist?
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:47:13
HAHA yes... that too.
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:40:37
So how can it be made so everyone can mine...
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:22:49
Can someone mathematically prove this HAS NOT HAPPENED?  I mean is the laymen casual bitcoin user able to analyze the blockchain and see for themselves?  If so can you send a link?
@_date: 2013-06-20 00:54:48
:) that would be AMAZING.  Greenbacks are now called debtcoins 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:54:33
So far we have seen A LOT of the mainstream bitcoin pillars that have fallen or majorly affected:
1. Silkroad - gone
2. Mtgox (broken...) 
3. Tradehill - gone
4. Satoshidice "blocked in us"
5. BTCT "Trading halted" 
6. Dwolla de-tached from gox
So what is the probability that blockchain will fail? And if not how but when? Has anyone else asked them selves this question?
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:11:04
Banks have managed to keep documentation of 8 billion people on earth spending several times a day, I'm sure this will work itself out, even if it means 3rd parties coming out with a service that stores the block chain on their end, and verifies from one point in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:43:56
BFL delivers?!?!?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:38:25
Thanks, point taken.  I'm just saying for purpose of a thought expiriment, and human nature being unpredictable.
Also everyone is like "satoshi is not about the money".  Ok, I can't confirm this, but say he isn't.  Well why would he care about cashing out safely and incrementally based on stranger's buy walls.  
Better yet, what if there s a script set as a program with a timer set to sell all coins one day. Since it's all an "experiment".
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:51:31
This sounds like an elaborate way of trying to steal the bitcoin idea and capitalize off it... "yeah lets make a new alt currency... in space!"
