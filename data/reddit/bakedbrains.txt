This is again underestimating the other side, which I think is dangerous.
I think they are wrong, but they are not stupid

well you get the gist, will downvote this to oblivion.

Hardfoek is the one of most dangerous things that can happen to bitcoin. 
Unless absolutely necessary, bitcoin should never hard fork.

When the big US institutions learn they're allowed to manipulate a market, what do you think they will do? 
McAfee is a joke compared to these guys.

Make sure you move all of it off an exchange to your own wallet.

From the Man himself - [
Like gold, U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply. But the U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost. By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation, or even by credibly threatening to do so, the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services, which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services. We conclude that, under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation.

Which makes it funnier, even the idiots are realizing the shit that is going on.   
It took a while and they are certain I'm an idiot, but the majority of my family own Bitcoin.

But Bitcoin kills babies

Once you fork off an altcoin you need to refer to it as an Altcoin. Bcash is bcash. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
This Hijacking and smear campaign attempts are just sad. roger should focus on building his centralized Chinese gov-backed coin 
instead of spewing venom everywhere
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:03:53
Roger is just a puppet being played by Jihan. 
Every time he talks in his sensational "bitcoin kills babies" way Jihan just can't stop laughing how someone can be such a loud sheep.
