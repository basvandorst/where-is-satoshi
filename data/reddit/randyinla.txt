Segwit was added to the Bitcoin code for the purpose of taking it down the path to work with LN in the future. It is not part of "Bitcoin" according to the white paper.  A new white paper is better than updating the existing one.

Your question said you didn't want to ask random people... yet you post in a reddit sub... full of random people.  
A new white paper attached to a new coin would be the best approach.  Doesn't make sense to go back and change the white paper because Blockstream wants to now have BTC work for them and make them money.  Very un-Bitcoin like.

The signature is pulled out of the transaction data, out of the merkle tree of who is sending/receiving and moved to the end.  This makes transactions safer to use with the LN.


 
And some people point fingers at others when they are the ones lying.

From what I understand (and yes, I may be wrong) Bitcoin had to have segwit added so that it COULD work with LN in the future.  Had to pull the signatures out... which some believe is a security issue.

He's saying that Satoshi created cryptocurrency... created Bitcoin... wrote the white paper.  Since many people think he's dead now (I have no idea if he/she/there is/are dead or not), maybe Satoshi could be resurrected to update the paper because it's Satoshi's white paper.  ie.Satoshi had nothing to do with SW/LN and probably wouldn't have.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:18:51
Then stop asking random people?  Segwit &amp; LN are not part of Bitcoin, so should never be put into the White Paper.

Install 3 or 4 desktop wallets and a few iphone/android wallets.  See which ones you like.  Use those.  The main point is that coinbase and any other online wallet/exchange owns the private key to the wallet, not you.  You want any wallet where YOU control the private key.  Look into Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets as well.

If he's truly a friend, then part of his anger probably comes from concern that you'll lose money in bitcoin.  
I had a few co-workers give me blank stares when I mentioned I got into bitcoin.  "It's a bubble", "It's too risky and not real" etc.  Only a few who knew about it were excited and a bit sad they hadn't gotten in.  
I found out a handful of co-workers had been into it already, but they were reluctant to talk about it openly for fear of others judging them for it.  Some used to mine.  One has been investing in it since 2011 when it was $0.05 and had made a plan to get out after 10 years or it hits $10k.  He's still in the process of cashing out (over 100,000 coins!!). 
I bet you will come back to this same conversation with your friend eventually, but things will be more mainstream-ish and the media will have been talking about it more and more and you will have more value in your portfolio.  He'll probably ask for your help in setting up his own wallet.  Be patient and HODL.

Coinbase is an exchange.  If you treat it like a bank, you have a good chance of losing your coins.  In fact, you don't own ANY coins when they are on Coinbase.  You own IOUs for coins because they own the private keys associated with the account.  How many posts do you see around reddit of people being locked out of the coinbase or other exchange account?  Coinbase could easily get hacked or have a glitch where they lose your coins.  Why in the heck would you leave coins on ANY online service?  Download a free wallet or a couple.  Find one you like.  Put your coins into it.

GOD!  I would HOPE they don't store your private key on their website server!!!   
Any hardware wallet "should" generate the public/private key pair for you and never, ever transmit it to a server OR store it on your computer hard drive.   Trezor &amp; Ledger are great hardware keys that follow this methodology.
Since wallets only contain encrypted private keys (not coins), it's best to not export them or otherwise expose them until absolutely needed.  The seed words are displayed and shouldn't ever be transmitted via the Internet or touch the hard drive.  ie.do NOT copy/paste seed words into a word document or anything else on the computer.  Write them down and store them safely.  Why?  There are viruses who's sole purpose is to look for such keys.
Many etch the words into a small metal plate so they are both fire &amp; water resistant and then store them in a safe.  The seed words can then be used to reconstruct the private key if you lose the hardware wallet.

Look, cryptocurrency is NOT ready for mainstream grandma/grandpa.  You should know this before exposing them.  Maybe another few years.  Just because someone may not "get it" doesn't mean their money should be put at risk!  If you have informed yourself, then the first thing you should do when giving any cryptocurrency as a gift is to inform them as well.
I never said "don't start off with coinbase".  Yes, coinbase is the onramp for BUYING YOUR COINS.  I said that.   Coinbase is NOT for keeping your coins.

If you're talking about USD transfer taking that long, use the Wire Transfer of USD initiated from your bank's website to Coinbase's USD wallet.  I don't believe the instructions are on the Coinbase how to pages... Click on the Deposit button for Coinbase USD wallet, then choose the Wire Transfer tab and follow the instructions.  Coinbase charges flat $10 for this.  Your bank will charge what it charges.  Mine charges $25.  The longest wire transfer I had was just about a day.  Fastest was about 15 minutes.  Transfer that USD over to your GDAX USD wallet, buy your bitcoin using the Limit buy tab for free, send your bitcoin from GDAX for free, not even the standard bitcoin transaction fee.

No one can stop someone from sending it
Blockchain by itself is not as powerful as cryptocurrency running on top of it.  Cryptocurrency IS a technology whether you understand or not.  Take cryptocurrency off of blockchain and you have a glorified database.  It's the way in which various technologies were added together that makes the sum greater than each individual part.

Every bit of a coin sent in a transaction has a unique entry in the public ledger which is copied to every single miner.  Every single new block has a hashed reference to the block before it.  When a miner figures out the crypto puzzle and retrieves their 12.5 bitcoin reward (how coins are created, btw), the block they create is proof that they solved the puzzle and included the transactions they chose to include.  Other miners then confirm said transactions when they receive a copy of the updated blockchain which has the new block at the end.  
It would take a lot more computing power, time and energy to try and duplicate a transaction than to simply mine the blocks and retrieve the reward + fees.  ie.if someone sent you 1 bitcoin, you couldn't duplicate that transaction or coin to give yourself 2.

Congratulations on moving your bitcoin IOUs to actual bitcoin on your own wallet!  Bravo!
There are a few portfolio apps for smart phones where you simply manually enter the amount of each coin you have and choose which exchange you want to use to pull current prices from.  I use one to track the various coins I own and the total value.  The only annoyance is if I transfer some to an exchange and buy/sell,  because I then have to remember to go into the portfolio app and manually update the amounts there.

Doesn't matter if they drive actual coin prices up or down.  They bet on either future gain or loss.  If they are right, they make money.  It would, however, matter to us if they bet it will drop because many who don't understand the tech will simply look at the futures and panic sell now.

A paper wallet where the private key and seed words have never touched a hard drive would be the safest.  It would typically be used as a one-way wallet, sending coins to it and not withdrawing from it.  You could import the private key into a software/hardware wallet, but at that point, the paper just becomes a backup and the funds attached to the private key become just a bit less secure.
Having said that, I use a hardware wallet.
You can search youtube on how to create a paper wallet or checkout

No one knows yet how Coinbase will implement giving access to bitcoin cash.  ie.if it will also be on gdax, or if it will also be free to send, or if they will go as far as letting people buy/sell bitcoin cash for USD, like BTC, ETH &amp; LTC.

If you are buying BTC, ETH &amp; LTC with USD on coinbase, that makes coinbase an exchange.  The difference between coinbase and gdax is that coinbase offers Market buy/sell ONLY and gdax offers both market AND limit buy/sell.

When I got into crypo in the beginning of this year, everyone's highest prediction was that bitcoin "might" hit $5,000 by the end of the year.  Even back in July, $5k was still the promised dream.  Everyone smiled/cheered, though inside, they didn't believe it could ever climb that high.  
Look where we are now.
The closer we got to $10k, the faster it was happening.  We went from $10k to $11k in 24 hours.  If John thinks it could hit whatever whenever, then chances are it'll be higher by the stated time.

Anyone with bitcoin (and 1/2 a brain) is automatically going to assume the buyer will reverse the charges once the bitcoin is received.  It's a stupid thing to do.  No one is concerned the seller will be scammed, because as you state, can just reverse the charges.  Ridiculous.

China?!  They seem to have a lot of miners.
I find it extremely sad that someone with a recent Masters degree in Engineering would ask on reddit "where would I go to solve a block?" :(    I would imagine you were taught to understand a problem before trying to solve it, yes?  The question shows a misunderstanding of bitcoin, mining and the process of solving the crypto algorithm.
Read the bitcoin white paper first.  Get an understanding of what mining is.  Watch any of the thousands of videos on youtube showing and explaining mining rigs.  Solving a block depends on a few things.  Which mining hardware you buy and where you live.  The price your power company charges per kWh is said to have to be less than $0.10 in order to mine with any sort of profit.  If you don't have the ducks lined up, then the chances of you ever solving a block are next to nil.  If you are able to setup a mining machine, keep in mind you would be competing against people with many millions of dollars worth of mining equipment, all clamoring for a solution to every single block, every 10 minutes or so.
If you do happen to solve one, then that'd be fucking awesome and you should come back and gloat like a bad ass!  Good luck.

Your coins are never in any wallet.  The only thing a wallet stores are private keys.  Private keys give you access to the coins stored in the public ledger, you know, the block chain.

Any wallet worth anything should present you with seed words that can be used to recreate the wallet, should the laptop get stolen.   I tend to think of three levels of wallets:
1. Phone wallet = wallet in your back pocket.  Only keep a few hundred for out and about day to day things.
2. Computer software or hardware wallet = my bank.  I withdraw to/from it to my phone wallet.  Keep more value in there.
3. Paper wallet = long term cold storage.  Most of my value will be in that.  The private key has never been on a computer.  I have never taken coins out of it, only sent coins to it.
You could utilize all three types or just one.  Up to you.

WHY would you want to keep any in coinbase?!  Coinbase is for buying coins.  That's it.  It's not for storing.  It's not a bank.  YOU are the bank.  That's the entire point of crypto.  To not download a free wallet and keep your own coins under your control is just plain dumb.

You never really want to export your private keys as that stores them unencrypted on your computer.  Best to write down the seed words and put them in a safe place.  Some go as far as etching them into metal plates to protect against fire/water damage.

Exactly! With such a small fraction of people actually into it, (was around 0.15% a few months ago.  No idea what it is now) it's currently used much more for trading than buying merchandise.  The more people get into it, the more stable the price will become.  Gonna take a few (many?) years, at least.

It's going up and down because it's being traded much more now than being used as a currency.  The more people who buy in and use it as currency, the less the volatility.  It's still in its infancy.  0.15% of the population are into it.  It will settle down over time.

When I first started buying with CC on coinbase, my bank would cancel.  Coinbase's error capturing sucks, in that, they should pop up a notice that the transaction never went through instead of just refreshing the page.  I quickly switched over to wire transfers, calling the bank after placing each one to make sure they didn't flag it as bad,  and didn't have any issues after that.

It's not so much that it "needs" to, it's that, typically, when anything hits a new high, some people who have been holding will sell for profit.  Sometimes, if enough do that, the price can dip enough to scare new blood into selling and running away.  That can cause the price to dip even more.  Some will see that as a fire sale and buy more, bringing the price slightly up... which probably attracts some of the new blood back into the fold.  The end result is typically a little lower than the high and it could stabilize at this new, slightly lower price.  Overall, people call that a correction.  It had the high, the slight selloff/panic mode, then return to stabilized trading.  The price is then viewed with more confidence than prior to the correction.
So when people say it is needed, I view it more as a warning that it's probably going to happen, so be prepared.  The longer it takes, the more of a drop "can" happen.

Now, how many posts do you see in the /coinbase sub where coinbase has locked peoples accounts or lost money and don't respond to support tickets?  It's not just about the site being hacked or going down or blah blah... It's that THEY own the coins, not you.  It takes less than a minute to send coins from coinbase to your own wallet.  Then you own the coins.  If you don't want to do it, fine.  I'm just sick of seeing people new to crypto not bothering to be safe with their money.

Coinbase is a broker and adds their fee on top of whatever the going price is.  Each exchange has their own prices since they all have different people buying/selling.  Which exchange price are you looking at on cryptowat.ch?  I would think the GDAX bitcoin price would be closest to Coinbase's, seeing as they are the same company.  Meaning they should both go up/down together.  Figure out what the diff between them is and always add that to what you see on cryptowat.ch.  Keep in mind that cryptowat.ch will be a few seconds behind any exchange.  At least that's been my experience watching things from Bittrex on cryptowat.ch.

Go to gdax.com, login using your coinbase credentials.  Move your coinbase coins over to the gdax bitcoin wallet.  Try transferring from gdax bitcoin wallet to your wallet installed on your computer. (I don't know what you mean by green address) There should be no fee doing it this way.  The fee is based on the transaction size, not the amount you are sending.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:06:51
Coins held on coinbase are a sure way to lose said coins.  You don't own the coins on any online service, they do.  They decide which forks they will or won't support.  They only provide you with IOUs to the coins you bought.  Get them off of there, today.
For security, actual coin ownership and receiving any forked coins moving forward, keep your coins in your wallet where you control the private key.  There are plenty to choose from, they are all free, they are easy to install.  install a couple, read reviews, watch youtube reviews, decide which one you want to use. 
 
Be safe and secure and don't worry that you won't receive any future forked coins.

Don't be a fucking douche.  You can market buy on Coinbase or market &amp; limit buy on GDAX.  They are both the same company and they are both exchanges.

A fork is a cloning of the original coin's software and public ledger.  Since the original ledger is copied, any coins listed in it will also be in the new one.  The cloned version of the coin will change it's name and some other settings to become the new forked coin.  If you did not have any of the original coins at the time of the fork, then you don't get any coins in the forked coin.
The only way to avoid forked coins is to not have any of the original coins at the time of the fork.  Even if you don't "claim" the newly forked coins, you still technically have them and they will be subject to taxation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:48:09
I think it's a bubble on top of a solid foundation of supporters/users.  
What I mean by that is that all the new people flooding into crypto are piling their money on top of existing long-term believers.  When news is put out on mainstream media bashing bitcoin, those who aren't into the technicals of what makes crypto solid will panic and flee.  Those people leaving will have a bubble mentality and cause a bubble-like effect on the price.  It will recover as it always has for 9 years.
Whereas some coins are a scam, overall, I don't think crypto is a bubble.  BTC will come back to $11k and beyond.  The more who get involved, the higher the price will go.  We're at around 0.15% worldwide adoption.  The price is going to get astronomical over the next 10 years.

You are in the 0.15% adoption percentile.

I found a comment somewhere that talked of the 1/1,000,000 club.  ie.People who own at least 21 Bitcoin own at least 1/millionth of all bitcoin that will ever exist.  
Wanna be in that club someday :)
An article on the number of millionaires and billionaires world wide stated that, "*Credit Suisse said in the same year [2015] that there were roughly 35 million millionaires worldwide, and was expected to reach 53 million by 2019.*"
If that is true, then there already will not be enough individual bitcoins for each existing millionaire to own one.  This is why bitcoin creates new wealth.  I'm sure plenty of millionaires are already in on crypto in some form, but I bet plenty are also missing out.

Being the 8th, and last, decimal place of bitcoin, the Satoshi is the smallest fraction thereof: 0.00000001.  This would be 121 Satoshis: 0.00000**121**  You cannot have 121.66 Satoshis.  They could possibly increase the decimal places in a future fork (way down the line), but for now, it can't happen.  Maybe round it up to 0.00000122 ?

I have always viewed, "to the moon!" as a speedy trajectory, not a destination.  I don't think we'll ever 'reach' the moon in regards to price.  It could keep climbing long after all of us are dead.  ie.the last mined coin won't happen until around the year 2140, 123 years from now.  
If you believe in the utility of bitcoin as a currency, then just hodl and use as such when appropriate.
If you believe in just a store of value that increases for profit, then get out when you feel like getting out. (if that's what you were implying?)  It's not going to just magically hit a number and stay there forever.  There will be natural recovery periods after huge gains, but it will go back up again after.

Not sure the reasons why he was thinking it would drop Sat, but the BCH pump might continue, causing btc price to drop.  The BTC difficulty algorithm changes Fri.  Even though fork.lol currently says it should go down by about 1.98% (number changes the closer to the difficulty switch), making it easier, if the miners shift their hashrate to BCH, that can cause btc transactions to backup and probably the price to dip a bit.

Do Bank Wire Transfer of your USD to coinbase.  There is a flat $10 coinbase fee for that and your bank will probably charge about $25 flat fee.  Transfer USD to GDAX for free.  Buy bitcoin on GDAX using limit buy order for free.  As soon as you have the coins, transfer to your hardware or software wallet, unless you want to trade on an exchange, in that case, move it to the exchange.  Don't leave it on coinbase/gdax (same company btw) and don't leave it on any exchange after you're done trading.  Cheers!

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:27:16
It's not, "hardware wallet instead of using an exchange".   It's, "store your coins in a wallet you control instead of using an exchange".  
Get your coins out of coinbase.  Coinbase is for buying coins, not holding coins.  Coinbase owns the actual BTC and you have IOUs to those coins.  
If you don't have your hardware wallet yet, download a free software wallet and transfer your coins to there.  "Transfer" simply means to send the bitcoin from one wallet (coinbase's) to another (software or hardware wallet that you own).  It's just a bitcoin transaction.  You will pay a bitcoin transaction fee.  Once your hardware wallet arrives, transfer from the software wallet to the hardware wallet.  Only transfer to an exchange when you plan on trading, then back to the hardware wallet when you're done.
Wallets don't store coins.  Those are all on the public ledger.  A wallet stores the private key to a wallet and keeps it safe.  A hardware wallet keeps the key in the hardware phob and doesn't keep it on your hard drive.  The way that you interact with the hardware wallet, ie.entering in a pass code for example, is obfuscated from any keylogger virus you may have on your computer.  A matrix of numbers are shown randomly on the hardware wallet's screen.  You use that as a map to click in a similar matrix without numbers displayed by the companion software that runs on your computer.  
Hope that clears some things up.  Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:38:14
If they can keep the block size small and force transaction backups and increase the fees, it makes the addition of segwit make sense.  I don't think the end justifies the mean at all.

Coinbase's bitcoin wallet is not "your" wallet.  It is coinbase's wallet.  You only own IOUs to said coins.  Download your own wallet software, create a paper wallet or buy a hardware wallet and transfer all of your coinbase coins to your own wallet where you are in control of the private key.  
The point of bitcoin is that YOU are the bank.  Don't get into crypto, which gets you out of the banking system, only to turn around and treat someone like coinbase as a bank.

* **Store your seed securely**... need to do the etched metal thing
* **Sending lots of BTC is stressful**... Yes, it sure is!
* **Weekly buys/cost averaging**... Did weekly buys at first, then a little trading to gain some coins "for free"
* **Long time for withdrawals**... Good to know! I remember it took a long time to get enough into the system, only makes sense it would take time to get it back out
* **Capital gains suck**... So was the 30k around 14%, or higher?  To be in the clear, I've been telling myself taxes would be upwards of 40-50%, so have been trying to build up my portfolio to have much more than I actually need after sending Uncle Sam his share
* **Being debt free is liberating**... AWESOME!
Thanks for sharing your exit strategy and good luck!

I don't believe the bitcoin software goes below .0000001, so just because you can technically end up with 1/2 of a satoshi, the software can't accommodate it so it rounds up.  I don't think it will ever have a name as I don't believe there will ever be a need to divide a single satoshi.  Agree to disagree.  Cheers.

For those asking how it's different than buying my own btc: I wouldn't have to go through the pain of wire transferring my USD to Coinbase, then send that to GDAX then set a limit buy order just to buy with no fees (aside from the $10 + $35 flat fees CB and my bank charges for the wire transfer).

You could find yourself a bitcoin millionaire in 20 years yet be the poorest person you know.  Think bigger.  To answer your specific question, though, I have no idea.  There are way too many things that can change in 20 years time to know how much bitcoin you need today to become a millionaire 20 years from today.  Depending on how much you put in, it could happen in a couple years, not 20.

Why couldn't it be real?  
1) Why do you think the payment would go through an exchange?  The buyer could simply send the bitcoin from their wallet directly to the sellers wallet.  Done.  That is the whole point of bitcoin!  To be decentralized.  Exchanges are only used to buy/sell other coins/currencies, not buy houses.  You can send $10 worth of bitcoin or $10 billion worth.
2) If you convert the bitcoin to cash, then you aren't paying with bitcoin.  You'd be paying with cash.  Anyone could accept bitcoin if they have a bitcoin wallet to receive the payment.  That includes a real estate company or an individual seller of a home.
3) I don't think I would buy a big ticket item such as a home through a website.

Also, if you setup 2-factor authentication with any bitcoin-related site, use Google Authentication, NOT your cell number.  It was proven a few weeks ago (google it) that hackers could intercept your SMS text messages, use the 2FA number to log into your account and steal your coins.

Coinbase owns the coins because they control the private key of each of their wallets.  You own IOUs for coins.  At any moment, Coinbase could decide there's something fishy with your verification etc., and decide to lock your account.  Coinbase could get hacked.  Coinbase could have any of a number things happen that would keep you from your money... that makes them a bank and you a customer.  Install your own wallet and YOU are the bank.  See how that works?  NEVER keep your coins anywhere other than wallets that you control the private keys for.

Yes.  All any wallet does is store your private key.  
Coinbase for buying/selling BTC, LTC or ETH only (may add more coins in the very near future).  
If you want to use BTC to buy/sell other alt-coins, then create an account on an exchange and transfer your btc there.  
Transfer all coins back to your wallet(s) when done trading.  If any fork of bitcoin happens and they offer free coins, as long as your btc are in your own wallet that you control the private key for, you will be able to extract the new coins (after the wallet manufacturer creates an extraction tool for it)

It was around $5,500 Nov 11 and look where it is now, $9.2k.  That's $3,700 in 15 days, approximately $246.66 per day for 2 weeks.  $246.66 per day for 4 days = $986.64.  So that tells me it's definitely possible and not some wish or dream.  I bet the excitement and psychological attachment to such a milestone as $10k will help it along faster than usual.

Google servers do not generate the numbers that change every x seconds.  The numbers are calculated on the fly on your device.  When you show Google Authenticator the QR code displayed by the service and it creates the new entry for that service on your device, then that instance of Google Authenticator and the service are now sharing a code that will be used on both sides to calculate a new number every x seconds.  I assume this is why LeftHello told you to screen capture &amp; print out the QR code displayed by the service when setting up GA.  You can use that printout of the QR code to setup another device with the same code.  I have not done this myself, but it couldn't hurt to try it out.  ie.use Google Authenticator on another device, hit the '+' to add a new entry and point it at the printed QR code.  Then try to log into the service using both devices at different times to verify it works.

If you do a Bank Wire Transfer into Coinbase ($10 flat fee from coinbase, $?? flat fee from your bank), it can happen as fast as under an hour.  Fastest I've had it complete was about 15 minutes.  I've done 4 or 5.  Initiate it Mon - Fri at a time that your bank has time to send it and Coinbase's bank in NY has time to receive it.  DO NOT FORGET TO ADD THE CODE COINBASE GIVES YOU TO THE WIRE TRANSFER'S COMMENTS!   Make sure your legal name in Coinbase matches your name on your bank account.  After sending each time, I call my bank to make sure they don't flag it and delay it.
Once the USD is in coinbase, transfer it over to the GDAX USD wallet.  It's instant and free.  
Buy bitcoin on GDAX using the Limit Buy tab, not the Market Buy tab, and your purchase will be free, no fee.
Good luck!

Bitcoin transactions are always one way and always initiated by the buyer/sender. 
 ie.No one can make a request for money or "undo" a transaction.  However, there is some new coin I can't recall the name of (I believe it's based on Ethereum) that works with a smart contract for deliveries.  You pay for something and it gets put into holding.  The sender of the merchandise doesn't get the funds until after the package is delivered (checks delivery service scans/system).  If the package never shows up (I assume after a certain amount of days), you get the funds back.  Not sure what happens if the wrong item was sent.  Just noticed the basics of the coin in passing.  Can probably find it with a little Googling.

I've done 5 wire transfers into coinbase and each of them happened the same day they were initiated from the West Coast.  Quickest was under 1/2 hour.  I initiated all of them from my bank's web site first thing in the morning on a business day.  Be aware that coinbase's bank is in NY, so make sure the transfer happens way before your bank or their bank closes.  Whenever I would trigger a wire transfer, I'd also call my bank after to make sure they don't flag it for some reason and cause delays.  Good luck!

Why wouldn't you just install your own software wallet on a computer or an iPhone and accept bitcoin straight to that?  Why use Coinbase?  If someone pays you in bitcoin and you instantly sell it for USD, you miss the opportunity that the $4 you received could be worth $5 or more the next day.  Keeping it in your own wallet is more secure than leaving it on coinbase.  I've never talked to a merchant who accepts it, so maybe this is the norm.  It just sounds a bit off the mark.

Move your btc to your own personal software or hardware wallet prior to any fork.  Don't ever leave your btc on coinbase.  Coinbase is for buying btc/etc/ltc, but you can't buy any other alt-coins from there.  So buy btc on coinbase and then move it to an exchange where you can buy other coins... or move the btc to your own wallet, but don't leave the btc on coinbase. 
edge case: If you have the Shift btc debit card, it can be linked to the btc wallet on coinbase or Dwolla.  So you'd have to leave some btc in either of those places for the card to work.

Re:laughing about buying coffee... I believe the goal is to eventually be a viable mainstream P2P cash system.  Right now, in this still early non-mainstream phase, too many are buying and holding, treating it like stock instead of currency.  So just like the guy who paid 10k btc for a pizza way back in the day that would now be worth around $38million, spending however little amount of btc directly for a cup of coffee today could be worth a lot more in a few years.  Not sure I subscribe to that fully, but it seems to be a common belief.

JuelAhmed: If you do a wire transfer from your bank to coinbase, it can happen as fast as 15 min. Go to the accounts page, click on the Deposit button on your USD wallet, Click "Wire Transfer" directly to the right of where it says, "Bank Deposit" and follow the instructions TO THE LETTER!  The name coinbase displays with the warning is your screen name, but the name they actually mean that should be identical to your bank account's name in your bank is your real name.  I had to email them for clarification because they show the wrong name.  Take the information coinbase gives you about their bank and account, then go to your bank's web site and send a wire transfer from there.  I initiated a large transfer from Citibank in the morning and called Citi a few minutes later to verify it would go through with no issues.  They said it went through while I was on the phone.  By the time I walked back to my desk and logged into coinbase, the money was in the coinbase USD wallet.  Approximately 15 minutes total.  Make sure to take into consideration the time.  Coinbase's bank is Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York.  Start your wire transfer early enough so they aren't closed by the time it happens.  Also a good idea to call your own bank just to make sure they haven't flagged it as potential fraud.   Citibank charges a flat $25 fee for sending wire transfers and coinbase charges a flat $10 fee to receive them.  Much faster than the ACH 7-day transfer and cheaper than the credit card fee (but costs more than the free ACH 7-day transfer... but who wants to wait 7 days?!).  I then transfer the USD over to my gdax USD wallet instantly with no fees and do a limit buy order for bitcoin on gdax, again, no fees for that either. Good luck!

"more in U.S. Dollars" doesn't say IN THE US.  Some places do consider bitcoin a currency, so I say 4) Bitcoin is the right answer.

bcc's whole intention was to fork prior to the introduction of segwit and segwit2x to preserve bitcoin as it was.  They then increased the block size to 8MB and I believe fixed or removed the replay protection (correct me if I'm wrong on this).  That's what makes bcc attractive to me.  Segwit &amp; segwit2x are new additions to the original bitcoin whitepaper and it is yet to be seen how it will all play out and work.

Perhaps the place I read this information meant all miners across all cryptocurrencies and not 'just' bitcoin.

Move your btc to your own personal software or hardware wallet prior to any fork.  Don't ever leave your btc on coinbase.  Coinbase is for buying btc/eth/ltc, but you can't buy any other alt-coins from there.  So buy btc on coinbase and then move it to an exchange where you can buy other coins... or move the btc to your own wallet, but don't leave the btc on coinbase. 
edge case: If you have the Shift btc debit card, it can be linked to the btc wallet on coinbase or Dwolla.  So you'd have to leave some btc in either of those places for the card to work.

There's a slight difference of direction going on.  1) Average people adopting it in the future, "getting it" and being able to use it.  2) People in media today who spout 1/2 truths and think they understand when they don't.  The former will require a lot of tech simplification to be adopted mainstream.  The latter requires people who DO know reaching out and educating those who clearly don't understand.  Eventually, the tech will change enough where everyone will get it easy enough.

Which fee is the merchant passing along through their pricing?   The sender of bitcoin pays the bitcoin transaction fee, not the merchant.  If the merchant then sends their received bitcoin to another wallet and encounters a fee, I would think that would be on the merchant and not passed on to the customer.

I get that he probably meant ACH, but to say it like that's the only way to buy...  You can initiate a Wire Transfer of USD from your bank to Coinbase for $10 fee on the coinbase side and whatever flat fee your bank charges (mine charges $25).  If you put the Wire Transfer in early enough on a business day, your USD can appear in Coinbase within an hour or two.  You can then move the USD to GDAX and limit buy btc without a fee.  ie.you can obtain bitcoin within an hour or two if you don't have USD in Coinbase and instantly if you do have USD in Coinbase.  Stop with the ACH transfers and waiting 7 days.

In this case, both are the same.  The currency name is bitcoin and 1 of those is also called a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:48:37
So many new people are seemingly afraid to move their btc around.  Install a software wallet or buy a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor.  Don't leave your coins on an exchange unless you are planning on trading with them. If you use btc as currency, you'll be sending btc to vendors and other people all of the time.  Get used to it.  Yes, there are fees.  Yes, it can take time.  If both of those are issues, then look into coins like ltc or bcc that are faster and much cheaper.

If a car company released 100 of a certain model and I had one, even if 20 were destroyed in junk yards, I'd still say I had one of 100 made.  Because there's probably no way for me to know that 20 were destroyed.  So, yes.  How does anyone know how many coins are permanently lost?  You are changing the meaning to "1/coins-that-are-still-in-use" (which is fine, if you state it as such) when the original intent was "1/coins-that-were-created"

The more people that buy into bitcoin, the higher the price will go.  Aren't we in the 0.1%?  We are still early adopters.  HODL.  Lately, every time it climbs there is some media coverage that causes the average Joe who didn't even know what bitcoin is to buy in.  On top of that normal ebb and flow behavior, there is a fork happening for Bitcoin Gold Oct 25 and another fork for segwit2x happening mid-Nov.  People will get equal amounts of each new coin as they already have bitcoin.  So many people are dumping alt-coins to build up their bitcoin stash for the free coins.  I expect the price to go down a few days (hours, even?) after the 2nd fork as people go back to their fav alt-coins.

I think you greatly underestimate "their" comprehension skills.  Just because it's not the norm doesn't mean they won't understand.  Also, the technology definitely has to change before it actually becomes mainstream.  At that time, it will be quicker to setup, easier/faster to send/receive and easier to understand.

There will only ever be 21million bitcoins released.  Whether they are permanently lost or not doesn't change the fact that 21 is 1millionth of total coins released.  Just because it's lost doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

This seems no different than when a news anchor goes on and on during some live news event, coming up with their take on why the perp is doing what they are doing.  It's an occupation of talking out of one's ass on the spot.  Of course there will be those who don't understand bitcoin before talking about it.

If you transfer btc from an exchange wallet to your own personal hardware or software wallet, you won't need the exchanges private key anymore because your btc will now be in your wallet where you already control the private key(s).  The private key is associated with the wallet, the account.  When you transfer btc, it leaves one wallet/account and goes to another.  For forks that dish out free coins, you want to have your btc in your personal software or hardware wallet prior to the fork.  The wallet manufacturer will probably put out a how-to for retrieving your new coins after the fork has occurred.

Bitcoin Gold fork happens Oct 25, yes.  Segwit2x fork happens sometime mid-Nov.  My guess is that a lot of people are selling some or all of their alt-coins in advance.  Which could mean, if true, that the price could drop drastically within a few days after the fork(s) as people buy back into their alt-coin of choice because their prices probably will have remained close to where they got out.

The coin software we all use today is much too technical for the average user.  It's like the days before DNS.  You had to know the IP address of a server and the direct path to whatever document you were looking for.  Now, you simply type in "somewhere.com/login" and you get a nice page.  So the coin software of today will have to evolve before avg Joe feels comfortable using it.  The 26-35 character public key needs to have some sort of name translation created, much like DNS, so that maybe  or $MyFancyBitcoinName would find the public key of the person you want to send to.  Rather than conceive of some sort of bitcoin bank, which pretty much centralizes a decentralized currency, think instead that the tech will adapt over time so it's easy for everyone.  We are the 0.1% and it's not in anyway ready for mainstream use yet.

When I first started doing bank transfers to coinbase usd wallet about 2-1/2 months ago, I called my bank after each one to make sure they didn't flag it as fraud or slow down the process.  One of the agents told me if I transfer too much too fast, I might be flagged as a possible terrorist and would have to come in to answer questions as to what I was doing.  I laughed and explained my take on cryptocurrency and how it appeals to me as I'm a software developer.  She said I'd be surprised to find out how many terrorists do similar transactions.  Awesome.
