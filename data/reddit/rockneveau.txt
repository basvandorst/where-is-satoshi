I read that thing like I read a work-related technical journal article.
"Okay, read the title of the white paper... skim....look at graph...skim-skim-skim...table, graphic ... Summary...DONE!!"
Shortly thereafter:

So..... you don’t keep money in a bank either?  Stocks.... do you hold the paper certificates of all stocks you own?  I prefer convenience (and risks) of exchanges and wallets.  Just my way of doing it.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:10:12
Just Hold it until IRS is no longer relevant
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:26:47
Just being silly
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:48:37
Just had to comment how refreshing it is to have a civil discussion on this World Wide Web BBS (I am showing my age here....) ��
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:54:42
I know.   But I’m accepting that risk. My opinion (not fact, just my opinion) is that some exchanges provide pretty secure storage (e.g., CoinbaseVault) and my losing access to that would be another Mt. Gox type scenario - something I just don’t see this happening in the coming years with a high level of probability..  and hacking of the exchange to steal my coin from an electronic vault (with time-delayed two-factor Authentication and e-mail notification of the activity) ranks pretty low on risk as well.
My previous response was not very articulate.  But I am getting sort of annoyed with the mantra (“Not your coin blah, blah,...) and hearing from bitcoin holders who scold and berate those of us who prefer the convenient (albeit, riskier) storage on what I consider to be fairly established exchanges..  A person is not stupid if they make an informed decision to store  coin on an exchange or a wallet.  
I actually have greater fear of having tens of thousands of dollars entrusted to my ability to safely manage and control a little USB-like device and a list of words and numbers.  I liken it to not trusting the banks and keeping cash money dollar bills in a secret hiding place somewhere on my property.  
But that’s just me.  Certainly not for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:30:37
No.... you will most likely be fined and put on a painful repayment plan.  That (to me) is not deep shit.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:46:16
Well stated.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:15:12
I am not filled with rage, silly.  I recognize the playground I am in has no rules.  How can you say commodities dont2have insiders??!!  If you get your hands on a crop forecast report regarding the outlook for corn harvests in the future before anyone else does, and then enter the market with this privileged information, you are doing insider trading.   It's illegal.  But only because it is regulated.  We are not regulated.  But it doesn't preclude the existence of priviliged "insider" information that can be acted on and result in a profit for those that know.  I'm curious as to why you said I was filled with rage.  I am not.  I know where I am and what this kind of investment entails.
I just find it amusing how you cling to the legal definition (i.e., insider trading is legally defined and crypto does not fall within, ergo, ipso facto, thete van be no insider teasing in crypto).
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:42:32
Try to save this.  It will be great to pull out and review 10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:43:31
Well.... its not worthless.  Looked pretty full of worth when cashed out to fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:45:09
Placed a nice pile of fiat into exchange.  Averaging in over next 2 months.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:28:36
Disagree.  It appears to more akin to “cocksuckery” 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:48
Ha!  Nice logic.  I love it! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:53:32
But you get your coin at the rate that was agreed upon at purchase.  What is the issue?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:48
Yeah, yeah, yeah..... Ima keep my accounts open, though.  Where else am I gonna keep my money ??? and how else can I pay my bills????
I guess I could forego direct deposit, ask for a paper check, go cash it down at the package store, and send out money orders via the United StatesPostal Service, but..... 
This is reality.  Banks are a necessary convenience. I need banks.

You should get a Nano if you think this way.

Who is going to investigate?  You are in unregulated space.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:21:11
Look at the rules CBoE put on BTC futures.  If volatility exceeds a certain range, the market is paused and no additional trades are accepted for a predetermined period.
Check out the details.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:39
Ehhh... maybe.  But I think these are different times.  It COULD happen.  But the era of Mt. Gox is in the past.  We have different risks now. IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:48:56
Ha!  Yes, I meet the definition of a Statist.  Got wife, kids, car, House (best investment ever!), retirement plan, stocks....and some crypto, too!
I got probably about 25 - 30 years left on this earth, and don’t want this boat rocked too much, now... okay?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:52:49
Ha!  Thanks for the laugh.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:16
You will get no more credibilty in this unregulated market than Coinbase.  Maybe you should pull out of crypto, set up an account with TD Ameritrade, and invest in the stock market.  I hear Apple stock has a sound, predictable rate of return.  Heck, in 3 years you could realize an ROI of 18.47%.��
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:58:37
Just read stuff relating to your question....you will then understand.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:36:00
Good point.  It is similar.  But regulated exchanges have legally binding protocals that determine when to pause trading for a "market cool down".  (I only know from reading.... not an expert in this area)
Coinbase does it more randomly.... with no criteria other than that their systems just fail open because they cannot handle the volume. (Or.... as I hear tell....to manipulate price and markets.) ��
But.... it does kind of have a (random) self-governing effect, doesnt it? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:42:53
Ahhh... stop yelling at me.... geez, I’m sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:47:16
Based on what?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:20:32
Oh, I can see that.  I just usually purchase with plans to not mess with it for awhile.  Thanks.

No evidence of this being a common occurrence.  It may be on the books, but people in the US just don't do this very often.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:13:25
Ha!  BTC futures is not "pegged" to BTC in any way shape or form?  Well.... then what is it based on.  I'm thinking its based on  BTC/USD.  Seems pretty pegged to me! 
Investing in the future price fluctuations of pork bellies does not require an individual to actually own the bellies of recently slaughtered pigs.  Nothing chickenshit about that, or BTC futures investment.  You don't need to physically own a commodity to invest in futures trading.  If anything, commodities trading is the least "chickenshit" of all the regulated investments out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:50:42
Well, actually,  I am often filled with rage, but it’s not because of Coinbase.

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:17
Its insider trading.  Don't use legal semantics.

Gold is not useless.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:00
There ARE insiders!  These decisions are not made by one person in an information vacuum. F you worked at Coinbase or heard from somebody at Coinbase that BCH was going to get added a few weeks before announcement, and then bought BCH.... you are an insider!
BcH has been climbing for weeks.  Those people likely knew (or were following suit based on FOMO).  Today....its people trying to catch the wave.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:27:24
Welcome.  
It’s not really BTC at all....it’s blockchain.
That where we will find the future (and fiat value) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:57
Okay.... say you work at Coinbase.  4 weeks ago you find out BCH is going to get added to exchange.  You say, "Oh!  When that happens, BCH is going to rise fast.  I think I will buy me some of that BCH".
That is the definition of inside information.  That would not be allowed in stocks/commodities.  Its allowed here, and I accept it as the arena in which I decided to play.  But lack of definition and regulation do not mean that inside trading therefore cannot exist.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:14:31
This is insider trading, but we are in a market that is unregulated.  No laws have been broken.  We realize +3,476% gains in 6 months.... but we takes our chances. I'm playing here because so much money to be made.  But realize there are no laws or regulations here.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:44
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:54:54
Hey!  I just noticed... “zero knowledge”?  That isn’t a very nice way to engage with someone you have a disagreement with.  I have no idea to your depth of knowledge, and you have no idea regarding my knowledge as well.  I’m surprised you would say that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:03:34
Wow.  Having these thoughts swirling around in your head, must give you a different perspective on the world than I have.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:40
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:12:56
Its not.  I always knew this, but today really hit home.  We can't have it both ways.... if we want SEC style regulation on insider trading, we need to accept the bogey-man of centralization and gov't regulation.  And no more +3,678% gains in 6 months, either.
Welcome to the f-ing show....
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:00
Your delusional.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:23
I would cash in on this.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:58:20
Check out Power Ledger if you have not already.  Real world example.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:22
I just love this logic.  You CAN inside trade crypto!  Foreknowledge, whale manipulation, etc. Are all the definition of insider trading.
It's just that we are in an unregulated environment.  But insider trading and manipulation exist. 
Ima keep playing and gather up my crumbs.... and I'm thankful that I got in when I did.
But dont2insult with semantic word games regarding inside info trading.

Uhh... for crypto only.... makes taxes on gains easier to figure out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:27:10
I signed up for unheard of gains for several years, with a cash out to fiat.  I just don't see a viable society where unregulated cutrency is the norm.

We don't really want this for GDAX or Binance.... but gotta accept the associated risks as well.

We seem to be in violent agreement!  ❤️❤️❤️
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:42:25
Thanks.  I think it does nobody any good when asking for advice to say, "It could go to 1 million...or it could go to zero tomorrow"
I don't think many of us think BTC is going to drop to zero anytime soon.  The probability for that is low enough to be excluded from serious consideration for the foreseeable future.
People cone hear for information.  Why get so annoyed about it?  Your not paying for the wasted electrons .
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:32
What??!!  CTFC doesn't even recognize crypto.  They are focused on gold and tin and pork bellies.  Go ahead.... report crypto fraud to the CTFC. This is a "Buyer Beware" Atlas-Shrugged survival of the fittest environment.  Nobody will care if you got tricked out of your little satchel of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:20
Oh.... hey.... woah now. You think any other exchange is going to be better than GDAX?

Stop being a fear monger.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:13:12
Oh.... i look at this only as an investment.  Similar to currency or commodities futures trading.  Fiat goes in....wait a few months/years...and get more fiat back out!
Hopefully it will work... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:09:16
This a real problem.  Its figure-out-able, but I don't see everyone adopting this as a way of life.  Hopefully the future will have more realistic options (like....a Fedcoin?)
