I hope in the future, there's a trustless way of buying online so that when you pay using btc (thru lightning so it's fast) the transaction will only push through if the buyer confirms a validation code from a delivery guy that he received the item (for things like T-shirts). Only then will the btc you have sent shall be given to the store.

You choose it at the beginning.
If your public address starts with 1 = You have legacy/not segwit
If your public address starts with 3 = You have segwit
Note: If your wallet is legacy and you really want to move all to a segwit wallet &gt; you may have to wait until transaction fees are low/mempool is low, then transfer your coins to a segwit wallet. Also, if your exchange does not support segwit, just like the blockchain, you may also spam them with messages for segwit address.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:40:59
Right now you have to create one.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:38:16
Find another cheaper exchange with better fees? :)
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:19:32
I’ll make a node that charges 0.001$ then my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:28:38
I thought users do not need to "keep" the payment channel and only merchants do?
Edit: I need to read more and answer my own question. Thanks

a) Is your wallet segwit in electrum?
b) You sometimes have to wait until the network is not congested.
a + b) I had a 7$ transaction using segwit, you just have to time it.
c) I have read somewhere about users complaining about electrum having extra transaction fee (even if you do custom fees)?
@_date: 2019-07-16 05:25:41
What I can understand is that future tech (like lightning network) requires or is developed around segwit. 
For security, think of Bitcoin Cash, it doesn't enable segwit.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:18:30
Of all the things that did not happen, this did not happen the most.
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:00:28
I think he is trying to say is: BTC vendors who use lightning application, Lightning wallet, and lightning transaction.
I already read your above comments and venezuela has no lightning yet.
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:30:18
If scammers lie, is their argument regarding the greatest scam, bitcoin, false? Which makes bitcoin not the greatest scam.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:33:51
and you need $40000 to transact. (I'm still reading about Lightning)

Shouldn't we also be building better organizations with our new wealth?

I live in Philippines, 1 BTC @ $100k could almost buy 2 houses and lots here. Maybe 1 in the city. or a Condo.
Edit: I should buy more lol.

I'm upset. (Cries with one eye)
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:30:55
x axis is your % rank of people who hold N number of coins

if you have Y coins you are in the X rank

Don't. Stop. Come back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:10
So does this mean that if we reach $100k a coin. Transaction fee would cost ~$40?
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:56:04
Try the segwit wallet within the electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:37:21
A site is asking for your 12 words seed.
Never ever share your wallet word seed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:28
And transaction fees would also move by the next order of magnitude right?
~$10k BTC range   : ~$4 TF
~$100k BTC range : ~40 TF
~$500k BTC range : ~$200 TF
Is it possible to have changes in the minimum transaction fee? sat/byte?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:17
Yes, something like that.

Thank you for this heads up.
So, the best option is to close all channels before a hard fork.
True,  very very messy specially to those who do not know.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:13:20
Is this the real life?

There's a lot of 1 star rating in the BitBit app. Were those problems fixed?

No. You have to go to Thailand for that. Pinoyland does not have that feature.

I don't know what they are smoking in there.
I'll check buybitcoin this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:33:19
Do you support segwit? I messaged Coins.ph support about when they would support segwit address, and instead they responded about segwit2x which was irrelevant. So, I did not bother elaborating more.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:12:42
Huge if correct

Thank you for an honest answer. I'll just use the buybitcoin instead.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:36:13
They are not the target audience then.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:37:31
I have friends on the financial industry and also talked to some college students.
College students are more aware than the financial guys.
On the stockmarket groups, people talk about it as either a get rich quick scheme, scam, won't work, some just buy and sell, and mostly ponzi scheme designed MLM carrying the name of Bitcoin.
I have not seen yet a very detailed guide about BTC on social media here. Mostly those I know who really know about it have their own circle of friends where they seriously talk about it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:58:51
Hi, what happens to btc inside the channels when a hard fork happens?
I'm newb. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:15:21
It means that coins.ph has catched the attention of 2% of your population.
The gray area is if BSP is pertaining to the peso or btc remittance via that exchange. Either way, BSP has nothing against crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:36:03
I think it means that your ledger will update automatically when you plug it in?
But let's still be careful and watch the coming weeks.

From Antonopolous' Internet of Money, Bitcoin runs on four technologies:
* Blockchain
* Proof of Work
* Cryptocurrency
* Peer to peer network
Bitcoin is not bicoin with just the blockchain tech.
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:14:53
Try to upgrade to segwit to lower your transaction fees my friend. It will help you in the long run when you pay your customers' change. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:30:48
Any insights of his you would like to share?

@_date: 2018-02-14 01:37:06
I am sure one reason is the transaction is not segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:17:07
Is it pronounced Hold or Hod - ul or Hod - el?

Why you not using segwit?

Thanks for this. So, segwit can’t do its magic when you use an exchange which does not let you to. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:50:32
So he could take more damage.

@_date: 2019-05-15 00:02:13
It's just insecurity. I just share news to friends but that always lead to a topic of buying BTC or not. It's like schrodinger's cat, telling them to buy or not can result to them winning or losing, and until then, I am responsible to them winning or losing.
I stopped telling anyone anything. Only if they do ask me.
