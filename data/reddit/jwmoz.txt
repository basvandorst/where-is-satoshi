Yep, it was some bullshit story he was telling as well. Had my fingers on h and l and the all in key is nearby. Turned talking to him turned back and I saw a big red loss. Fucker. Overall I'm still up but quit after that.
My friend did some work for doog on his site. Told me doog is all aware the key is nearby and it's there for that reason.

It used to be £1.65 for a Carling in Wolverhampton.  It's ~ £4 in London.

@_date: 2017-07-28 12:11:57
Is the BTC stored on card? E.g. conversion only happens at point of sale?
Else it's a waste of time.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:31:35
Holy. Shit. I got burnt by 12 losses on there, lost around 50btc. Stopped since then over all up 100ish. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:29:56
A blockchain.info tx of mine took 14!!!?!??!hours yesterday to complete as blockchain sent it without a mining fee for some daft reason.
