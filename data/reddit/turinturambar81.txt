Tell that to Keynesian economists, who feel inflation is good and the answer to "too much federal debt" is more.

Having worked for Oracle, they have to be the worst offenders in this.

It would be "thirty-four seventy", not "three four seventy".

That's like saying Beta lost because VHS was a superior video taping format.

It's anti-competitive, in the same way "dumping" in consumer goods is, or Wal-Mart expanding loss leaders to force out competition in a new market. They are using their sheer size to make changes wholesale to the marketplace itself, not decisions that are an attempt to benefit their business in response to market data.

If your house gets robbed, it gets robbed. The thief getting punished is justice, but it doesn't change the fact that your house was robbed. Some actions cannot be undone, which is why insurance exists in the first place.
If I'm Jennifer Lawrence or Kate Upton, I probably don't take any nude photos, but what I definitely don't do is keep them in any sort of networked storage. No amount of insurance or jail time fixes this problem once the horse is out of the barn, so precautions have to be taken to prevent it from happening, more so than you and I. Same reason the president has security detail; his death means a lot more to the world than mine does and so extraordinary measures are taken to prevent it compared to the average citizen.
Where you are wrong is to build up the straw men suggesting that 1) criticism relating to the enablement of this situation is equivalent to "slut shaming", 2) that there's any backlash about the existence of the nudes at all, 3) that the folks you are responding to believe the person responsible is guiltless as a direct result of the inadequate security measures. Believe it or not, people, yes even Redditors, are capable of more nuance than what you are hinting at, which is essentially "whatever justifies titty pics is the argument I'm going to make".

What is your source for your assertion?

Stated in my first sentence. It's not in the spirit of fair competition, just as a few large players colluding to keep prices high in a situation where new upstarts can't compete isn't. Selling at a loss does not benefit the business or the shareholders other than to reduce competition in the marketplace, because by definition it reduces the profitability of their operations.

Bank of America and US Bank are the worst. Chase and Citi are downright reasonable compared to those assholes, at least when it comes to personal banking.

I'm experiencing a new level of confidence in this venture!
