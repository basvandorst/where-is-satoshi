I'd just like to post a followup to my post yesterday that today's conference was a lot more focused.  There was still a lot of amateur grassrootiness, and having the bullion and local currency guys on the panel kind of brought it down, but the (exceptional) Etherium and bex.io talks made it worthwhile.

You were at the art showing (as was I). It was sad and disorganized and made the btc community in Vancouver look like a bunch of flea market rejects: candle makers, day traders, and cash4gold swindlers. When the Doge boys are the only ones there dressed professionally, you know there's a problem.
The organizers did a *very* poor job unifying today's events which were broken into 4 parts at different locations (art auction, gaming, hardware demo and exchange). Today seems like it was supposed to be a meet and greet/market effort with tomorrow being the conference/tech end of things... but... that's not really clear on their website.
 seems to be the best source of info (rather than the coop link that just shows the art show), and [this is the link to the conference meetup](
It's not outa my way, so I'm going to pop into tomorrow's actual conference in hopes that it's less disheartening, but so far I'd have to rank their community organizing skills somewhere between pot rally and farmer's market.
Edit: Just saw the pic, and that Andrew Wagner guy was there and did a brief talk on the mic that was just him talking about Coinfest instead of anything currency related.
