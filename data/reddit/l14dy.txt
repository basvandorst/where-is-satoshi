So, we talk to Bitfury and start HODLpool
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:43:28
Ok, so maybe I rushed into it.
But still, we could make a reddit pool!
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:35:26
Its really too bad we have to do these things though. Id much rather just rely on btc being valued by true supply and demand. But its so centralized... One company that produces ASICs, really??? A hand full of people that own maybe 80% of all coins... Wow!
I have to say, if people really believed in decentralization, they'd sell their coins to reduce their hodlings to say 25'000 BTC. That's 25 MILLION dollars. How many private yachts can you waterski behind???
If the whales did that, there would be more for us all.
And when is there gonna be a second ASICs producer??? I mean, with all this HoneyBadger crap that gets thrown around, Im sure the pro SegWit Community could throw down and we could try to make something ourselves. A truly decentralized mining pool, that was run by us! It probably wouldnt pay off a profit in the long run, but maybe we bream even. We as the reddit pool signal seg wit and tell these BU noise makers to go start their own chain!
I just wish the whole community camr together to fix thid. Its become so sad!
Come on HODLers, lets unite; make our own Mining company, with blackjack and hookers!!
Ill pledge 10k (which I really dont have, but willing to sell my car).
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:47:08
Ok, but I live in a place where 6 cents per kWh is totally doable. We could run a reddit pool where de set up a non-profit or something of the like and run these things in a warehouse. Crowdsourcing?

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:51:59
They could, but the issue lies in the transparency of it. They would most likely issue a Crypto with no public ledger. Not a private ledger like Monero or ZCash... No,just a ledger that only they can see. Such a ledgercan run on a single server, and why not just let companies have their own ledger.
Also, monetary policy is much more complicated than just halving the issuancd supply every 4 years, so they would want some type of Crypto where they can issue coins... A central ledger is just easierto achieve this.

    You act like you've never seen BTC go parabolic before
    Jaws all on the floor like 70% marketcap dominance bust in the door
    Started kicking some ass worse than before, they first doubted us
    over the shitcoins
    It's the return of the, "Oh wait, no way you're kidding"
    It didn't just do what I think it did, did it?
    And Chinese mining cartels said,
    nothing you idiots, BCH dead, its locked in BTC basement
    Maximalist ETHists love BTC, chicka chicka King of Crypto, I'm sick of him
    Look at him, growin organically shooting for the you know what
    Pumping the USDT, "Yeah but its insolvent"
    Yeah, we probably growin too quickly for our own good
    But it's nothing compared to way that korean gambling is understood
    Every day BTC on TV and just let loose, but it's cool for Ethereum
    to pump 20% and start claiming flippening delirium
    My value prop is on your lips, my value prop is on your lips
    And if you're lucky you might get a taste of this
    And that's the message that we deliver to Cyrpto noobs
    And expect them not to know that Jihan Wu has boobs
    Of course they're gonna know what scalability is, by the time they hear about Lightning
    Lightning's got Youtube channels, don't they
    We ain't nothing but cypherpunks
    Well, some of us like pump and dumps
    Who create bagholders and eat each others lunch
    But if you feel like I feel I got the smart brains
    Racking up more gainz, sing the corus, BTC insane
    Cuz this is a long pole, yes, this is a long pole
    And all the other candles are just insinuating
    That BTC is going up, going up, going up
    Cuz this is a long pole, yes, this a long pole
    And all the other candles are insinuating
    That BTC is going up, going up, going up
    Yes this is a long pole, yes, this a long pole

@_date: 2017-04-22 22:17:26
Right, to point 3, you're saging that they could block your commitment transaction to close the channel until your counterpartie's refund transaction unlocks.
Wouldnt we be able to circumvent this risk using CTs, i.e. making the update transactions CTs, so when I tear down a channel, the miner has no way of knowing who signed for the funds?
I guess since my counterparty has seen the tx, it could still collude with the miner.

@_date: 2017-04-29 07:33:08
This is a graph that shows you how many individual unspent "coins" (UTXO) there are. In Bitcoin, we count 0.546294 BTC as 1 or more unspent transaction outputs. That is, assuming you have a wallet that is 0 BTC to start and you receive 17 incoming payments totalling 0.546294 BTC, that counts as 17 UTXOs (assuming you didnt move any of those incoming coins along the way). Now, you can merge them all into one UTXO, but you would have to pay a mining fee. This is sometimes referred to a CoinJoining (or a simple version thereof)
The above Graph shows that for some reason people are either CoinJoining all their "coins" to have just one, or by some weird act of nature, this is just a side effect of the current environment.
Either way, this is good for bitcoin as it helps reduce the memory requirements for running a performant fullnode
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:34:28
Hmmm, it could be that a bunch of people moved their hot wallets into cold storage
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:44:06
Oh, I see what you said now... Misread I guess.
Who knows if fees go back to normal. With full blocks, they won't any time soon. I think BU is dirt, but I also feel that the 1MB limit is somewhat ridiculous. I understand we don't mess with consensus rules, but at some point we will... There's only so much you can take out of a TX... I wish there was a more efficient way to use CoinJoin... But since we pay feed per kb, it doesn't really matter anyways
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:32:35
Lowcarbjc is a total bro, but next time you could keep in mind that you could just shapeshift to anither crypto and shapeshift back after a small pump. If you would have ridden the ltc train earlier in the day you would have made them 20 centses easy

At 50c fees for P2PKH txs, bitcoin cant do the job... For most people thats a half days wage.
Yes, bitcoin will be used as a store if value, but ltc and LN have the potential to bank the unbanked.
Now, btc could get its shit together and activate segwit, but at this point were still a ways off
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:27:27
Yeah, but LTC will get GMax's CTs, Schnorr Sigs, TSigs, MAST and MAST compilers.
Bitcoin is dead in the water without innovation, because even though Im a long time hodler, the time to wait for a BTC tx is unnecessarily long when ill be able to send money instantly for no fee in 6 weeks on LTC

@_date: 2017-09-23 11:52:58
Normal atomic swaps require multiple block confirmations to protect either party against reorg. Therefore, they take a while.
On lightning they're instant because of the HTLC and multisig construction. You can do atomic swaps as quickly as you can check signatures

@_date: 2017-09-23 05:35:57
You do not need transaction malleability. The number of txs makes no difference. There is no situation in which a transaction got malleated in the protocol I desribed and you are unable to recover your funds. Look at the protocol, and think about if you malleated any of those txs, their txid changes... But it doesnt matter, because you don't need the txid
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:29:47
No, you dont need a malleability fix for on-chain swaps. You need it for LN, which allows for instant swaps.

Your iPhone is the epidome of encryption and safety from tracking/persecution. There is no consumer device out there that has the security featyres an iPhone does. Hardware enclaves developed by Apple that have not veen researched en masse like SGX, so there are few known vulnerabilities. The company also took a firm stance towards privacy by not helping the FBI crack the Bernardino shooter's phone. The FBI had to brute force it, which probably took weeks. Every app/process is sandboxed in iOS, so apps can literally NOT talk to one another unless you allow it.
Any security lapses are strictly your own fault.
I'd say iPhone is exactly what a HODLer should buy wih his gains if he would rayher not invest more into crypto.

@_date: 2017-09-16 08:15:38
Why does apple need to reassure anyone of anything? Check the code
No clue what you mean by secure phone, but a battery does not impact the security of the device.
No sim on the phone... im assuming no WiFi/Bluetooth/NFC. You just described an airgapped computer. Yes, an airgapped computer is more secure. But an airgapped computer is impractical. So how do you make a phone secure given that practicality is its main use case. That's right.. you put hardware enclaves in, make the phone super difficult to take apart to ensure no chip fuckery and add sandboxes to protect against remote attacks.

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:28:58
Am I the only one who doesn't understand how it's collateralized???
What happens if ETH vs. BTC tanks? Does Shapeshift send ETH to my contract? How would that be trustless... I have to trust that they fund my contract...
Example: I have a PRISM that has 100% BTC. ETH/BTC is at 0.075. I send 10 ETH and get 0.75 BTC (ignoring the horrendous fees).
Now, what happens when ETH/BTC goes to 0.01? I should still have 0.75 BTC, so that makes 75 Ether. So, where do the 65 ETH come from? Does Shapeshift send them to me?
How is this trustless?
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:46:12
I dont think the whitepaper is the best place to start. Developer documentation on bitcoin.org is my go-to suggestion for anyone new

@_date: 2017-05-24 04:24:09
Right? So everyone agrees with me that this is totally not trustless?
They would need to lock in all the possible potential​ gains... I mean, just imagine a scenario where I had my Prism in Ripple... Wow. So there's no way they can collateralize it.
I think they just mean that the initi ETH you sent to the contract remains in the contract, so you can never lose your initial investment (making it as trustless as the solidity code they wrote.

Empty blocks have a variance like everything else. Empty Blocks have virtually 0 latency, so if you have a couple miners running a huge operation in Venezuela for instance, where the internet isnt great, it may be easier to tell them to just mine empty blocks instead of having to realy all the txs to them.
Sometimes they get lucky and mine 3 in 12 hours.
Also, there was a selfish block about 12hours ago. Antpool relayed a block header. They do this when they find a valid block pretty quickly and just start to mine the next one. They relay the first block with no tx data so it propagates theough the network instantly, ensuring that everyone knows to use this new hash in the block they're making. They send the txs in the next block

Hello all,
so this morning, I created a post to see if I could sell a car I recently received for some Bitcoin. I live in a place where cars are pretty expensive, so I expected something like 20BTC would be a fair price.
Well, I was received by significant ridicule from the community... Needless to say that noone was interested.
Another user u/denk0815 wasn't exactly the nicest of all replies, and for some reason his reply ticked me off more than others...
Well, I wasn't nice. I said some things that aren't acceptable, and I actually deleted the post because I was quite disappointed with my reaction. Needless to say that deleting a post does not make the underlying issue go away, so I would like to formally appologize to u/denk0815 for my behavior.
From the image:
"Block number 47[5]499: &lt;block hash&gt;
Dear u/denk0815,
I would like to apologize for my comments in the post I made earlier today. I acted like a total dick-bag and I have to admit that I feel pretty bad for behaving in such a childish was in a public forum. Now, given that we both live in the same part of the world, I would like to invite you to get really fucked up together one night in Switzerland... Let's say: A town of your choosing (it's a small place). As of right now, I still have a car to come visit, so we could totally meet up.
Please accept my apology as a token of our new found friendship, and let's put this behind us... I was in a somewhat inebriated state and more importantly, I was very distraught by your initial comment, which led me to behave in such a shitty manner.
Let's put this behind us and be friends. What do you say?

Latency, reorg rates, orphan rate, and more importantly selfish mining occurrence (e.g. if antpool releases 5 valid blocks at once).
If all these are lower or at least not drastically higher than with SegWit BTC, I would consider "You win"

I agree with you 100%. I sold all my Ethereum over the course of the last rise from 95 to here.
Even if Ethereum goes up 10x over the next year, your reasoning is 100% sound. Even if lately it seems like you should just do the opposite of whatever seems reasonable (e.g. I sold 25% of the ETH when it went up 25% against BTC... But it went up 200%, so I should have held off)

This guy is no genius. He was offered 100k or 300BTC and he took the BTC???

Why not just take the money and buy BTC with it?
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:47:01
Bitcoin, yes.
Altcoins though??? They're completely quite useless.
ETH is useful for little more than sending to your friends (if they will accept it at 250) and investing in ICOs.

I dont care who can code well. I can tell you that noone in this world other than core has been capable of creating a codebase that implements Bitcoin without it crashing constantly. The changes to the codebase for the 2MB HF are largely hurried and will not work.
I don't care what Adam Back signed, I care about whether or not someone is capable of implementing the shit they spew. I know I can't... Hell, I barely even really understand SegWit.
So you know what I do? I shut the fuck up and let the big boys write the damn code.
If I was capable of writing a HF code, backtesting it and making sure it's all ready to go in 3 months, well then I would be talking... I'm not talking.

There are ways to spend a large amount to a Schnorr Sig, and have a group of people run an online algorithm to determine who owns how much of that UTXO. Theretically, using Schnorr Sigs woukd allow for all those 7billion people to command one UTXO, but for obvious reasons thag's not practical. But you could use this construction to spend the Bitcoin to a Mutual fund structure, and any "spend" of these Bitcoin would pay the one UTXO to each of the members of thr fund according to their balance.
If this setup tx spent to a lightning channel, then they could even all use that money to make payments... granted that one of the memvers had a channel with other nodes.
The whole construction is a bit involved though and the offline algorithm requires linear time to achieve consensus, so the duration to "process" one tx in the pool is linear in the number of pool participants

I work in the enterprise blockchain space, and I can tell you that the denial hasn't set in yet.
I've been working on a small light-weight distributed database protocol (inspired by Couchbase), which piggy-backs the Bitcion blockchain for payments. I think that's the future. Everything should run on the Bitcoin Blockchain IMO.
My 2 Sat 
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:20:57
Well, as you may know: Blockchain is a Solution looking for a problem in about 99% of cases. I currently work on decentralized marketplaces. We are building a platform that will allow a specific product (think financial services between publicly traded companies) to be bought and sold instantly. The key idea is that there needs to be a ledger of who is buying and selling what particular product and then the ownership of said product has the change hands at the same time as the funds to pay for that product. If you run this using a webServer, you actually need to have someone maintain this marketplace and all parties have to trust that third party.
But for some products it's just not worth it to do so. Also, in some cases the stakes are quite high, so it would beneficial not to have to trust a third party to maintain this transaction server.
Hence, we are building it on blockchain(-ish). It's not really required, but that's where we are right now. We've tried in Ethereum (nightmare) and Hyperledger (garbage). So now, we're basically trying to build a distributed database that will then plug into the Lightning Network to facilitate payment.
It's not ideas at this point, we're actually building it. Whether or not it catches on or people actually use it is anyone's guess. Building this platform on a signle server would be damn near trivial, but on Blockchain it's a bit of a pain, so we decided to strike a balance between the two somewhat.

You can (allegedly) change POW through a soft fork.
He is saying there are essentially no ethical changes that can't be done via softfork except changes to the PoW.
-&gt; All ethical changes can be done via Softfork except PoW

Right, we use Bitcoin for the stuff that matters, i.e. exchange colored coin for LN payment.
We use a pretty simple distribuetd database, broadcast protocol, timestamp server for the rest, i.e. submissions to the marketplace, deletions, alterations, etc.

@_date: 2017-06-06 08:47:18
Do you have any idea how many people dont give a shit about Bitcoin, ETH or Litecoin, not to mention any of the other shitcoins? There are so many people in it exclusively because they expect the price to go up. As soon as the orice starts going down (and it will), all these people will run for the exits. 100bn is a huge bubble at this point, because adoption has NOT increased 5-fold, while speculation has.
I was talking about more than just ETH. I was also talking about LTC and how BTC is being used purely as a (speculative) store of value right now.
I said there's no real-world use case for ETH right now, and there fucking isn't. Name one that is available right now that is orthogonal to the ETH ICO ecochamber and lord Vitalik's wim.
You are telling me about melonport. Well, show me their product... Until I can register my company on MelonPort, or register a Private key to digitally sign documents on MelonPort, it's not a real-world use case yet.
You're in a Bitcoin subreddit and my argument was that a 100Bn market cap is primarily a highly speculative bubble that will most likely not live up to its promises. Not that ETH is shit.

Meh... There's really no purpise without monetary incentives. In the absence of money, byzzantine fault tolerance goes out the window. Once byzzantine fault tolerance goes out tge window, you're better off using much more efficient protocols like Authenticated Agreement or Paxos. Hell, Couchbase has terrific consensus mechanisms even for very large distributed networks. Blockchains are oretty useless when anyone can mine a competing chain by simply dedicating hash power with no reprecussions (financial or reputational). If the blockchain gives him no monetary incentive, then he has no reason to mine any particular chain (except honesty)... Every chain he mines on will cost him the same either way, because there is no block reward or fees that he could miss out on by mining a competing (yet inferior) chain
