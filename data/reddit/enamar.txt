Good luck, pal
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:37:28
I wish I could say "relatable".
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:36:53
Pics or didn't happen :p
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:54:41
You can call me unlucky then
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:52:54
I always smile when I see a happy Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:04:30
Let's hope it won't be unlucky to us.

 [  &lt;- you can buy BTC there with a credit / debit card. It should suffice in your case.

Low fees usually lead to scams or not safe exchangers. If I were you, I'd use a secure exchange platform like [CoinDeal]( It has a Swiss VQF license (which is pretty rare) and 90% of the cryptos are stored in cold wallets. Also, there are discounts for CoinDeal Premium users and for SegWit ones.

That I own a full, one bitcoin only to flex on the people on twitter.

I've seen this picture dozens of times and every single time I believe it less and less.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:13:51
As for general advice - hold your cryptos in wallets and not on the exchange platforms.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:00:35
Goals. Imagine your family waiting for you to die in order to inherence your bitcoin and you take your keys to the grave.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:11:47
Try to popularize Bitcoin in your local community :)

Whenever I need to check if the coin I'm interested in buying is in good condition, I use Galaxy Score. 
As for Bitcoin, right now: 
Price Score  2.9/5  (pretty low)
Social Impact Score  3.8/5 
Average Sentiment  3.7/5  
Correlation Rank  3.3/5
(source:  [ )
If I were you, I'd wait for a little for a better Price Score.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:51:05
Agreed. I'd sell it on a cryptocurrency exchange platform if I were you.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:17:57
There are various ways you can buy bitcoin. For example, on CoinDeal you can buy BTC via Dotpay, Epay, Skrill, Mistertango and Payeer.

The future is now
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:22:33
Color me impressed.
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:27:48
Nice one. Did you have it made for you or was it some sort of craft that you're interested in?
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:38:19
coindeal.com 
It's an extremely secure exchanger:
\- it has a Swiss VQF license
\- 90% of the cryptos are held in cold wallets
\- it is protected by SwissSign, SSL Secure Connection and Cloudflare
Not to mention around 50 coins available, lots of fiats and payment methods. AND you get to vote for the next crypto to be added to the platform. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:18:31
Though, you can't buy it if you're from:
The Bahamas,
Trinidad and Tobago.
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:31:10
I'd use coindeal since it's very secure. 
Please remember that low fees/no fees usually lead to a scam. Good luck with your withdrawal!
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:29:01
CoinDeal. You can buy BTC there by Visa (as well as Dotpay, Epay, Skrill, Mistertango and Payeer). Also, it has free deposits via bank transfer, so it's worth checking out.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:12:23
Ah, yes, the "dramatazing" effect. I love it.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:41:50
CoinDeal. If you have a SegWit account you get a 50% discount on your BTC withdrawal fees. 
Also, you should avoid exchangers that have very small / no fees. They usually end up being a scam. Security should be your priority.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:09:54
I'd go for CoinDeal. As far as I know, it has no limits when it comes to buying bitcoin. Not to mention, that if you're a SegWit user, you'll get a 50% discount on BTC withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:41:26
Yup. It's extremely secure. It holds 90% of the coins in cold wallets. Also, it has a prestigious, Swiss VQF License. If you're interested you should check its security here:
