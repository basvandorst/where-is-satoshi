I thought you could do that as long as you declared it first?

You're not thinking sigmoidally...

Oh my bad, I thought instant was only with credit card. You don't really deal with the fluctuation though, when you send money to campbx isn't when you "lock in" your buy. Sure, until the money is actually reflected in the account you can't submit bids, but your money is still in dollars until you do so and you don't have to trade for bitcoin once it is reflected in your account.

I don't think the 3rd party dispute resolution will work as well as planned. Based on what you've said, sellers will want the 3rd party that is biased an usually sides with the seller, and buyers will want the 3rd party that usually sides with the consumer. Since sellers usually set terms, I think they'll be the one to usually set the 3rd party and consumers will be worse off. On top of that, time spent researching the 3rd party and buyer leads to more search costs. None of this accounts for a corrupt 3rd party who misrepresents one sides story, eg 3rd party that usually sides with seller downplays and discredits anything consumer says. Sites like ebay have a 3rd party with vested interest in keeping buyers *and* sellers around for more business. I think a better way to pay for 3rd parties is to have some score system that is then converted to money based on a share of the total *site* revenue. That could avoid some conflict of interest, though I still would wager seller-biased and consumer-biased 3rd parties will emerge and cause problems with the minority of transactions that involve scammers.

I've heard that too - but for a company that does business entirely online using bitcoin does that really matter? It's not like BTCe where little is known about the companies location and ownership, it's a registered business in Georgia that you can go down and sue if you absolutely need to. I mention it just as an example of a US company though, it isn't true to say there's no US competition. If coinbase substantially worsens its policies I wouldn't be surprised if campbx and others began to take more of their business.

Mailing postal money orders to campbx worked for me in the US, if you can stand the ~4 day lag.

This isn't true - there's CampBX, not sure why everyone says there's no other options. CampBX is inconvenient in that there is no bank connection and direct transfer but is convenient in that... there's no bank connection or dealing with direct transfer. You mail a USPS money order and it shows up in your account within about the same timeframe that a Coinbase bank order goes through. Cost of MO+Postage is ~2$, for which you get similar pricing on a real exchange and a much less privacy invasion.

One thing I've noticed and have a theory for - my "mainstream" national bank account transfer b/t my checking/savings is instant. To put $ into my credit line though (same bank), it takes 2-3 days to show up as a transfer done the same way. I'm guessing they do this to catch people that send the $ 1-2 days before it is due, allowing them to charge interest. The bank simply doesn't have incentive to process it faster. Transfer of $ from my USAA accounts and card on the other hand (no shareholders, profits either go back into USAA or given back to users) go through instantly.

On Campbx where I do my exchanges, there is a limit of $1k/day. You have the option of raising it through "know your customer" [(KYC)]( which involves giving them lots of personal information. That may be what he is referring to, though I don't know if KYC only applies to banks. I would be very surprised if there wasn't a similar limit on individuals in the US though.
Funny note on the wiki article, KYC was made mandatory for US banks courtesy of the 2001 Patriot Act.

If I'm understanding it right you don't see the stealth address at all. The stealth address was learned by the sender (you don't see that happen), and he used that information to generate a new address and a nonce. He then puts BTC in the new address and informs the owner of the stealth address of the nonce. The private key of the new address can be determined from the nonce and the stealth address (and maybe also the new address's public key?). The receiver can then sweep the address the money was just sent to. The stealth address only existed for this one-time use address to be set up, have money delivered by sender, and then swept away by receiver just by having the receiver share the stealth address (something you don't see happen) and the sender share the nonce and one-time use address (something you do see happen on the block chain). 
If I have that wrong at all please correct me.

Could you expand on this? About all the tax I pay is automatically deducted through payroll and I still got a surprisingly large return. Are my employers deducting too much or something?

You underestimate the Israeli supporters, though I'd agree they'd get much less money overall. Hamas on the other hand would probably get more money.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:19:43
Not at all. Campbx for example accepts postal money orders which you can get with cash all over the US. Up to $1k/day to stay under KYC limits. Big upside in low processing costs (cost of MO + postage) but some downside in time (~1 week from mail date).

Thanks, I didn't realize this, I thought everyone just got a sizable % of their deductions back... you rock!

Great post - one other risk of fiat is institutional seizure. Didn't silk road have like 80M in btc when it was taken down? That'd be something like 800M now... I wonder if the FBI was actually able to get the wallets.

Do you think he's aware that a lot of dollars don't actually exist? There are way more dollars in the economy than there are paper bills in circulation. Not that there isn't a stark difference between there being _some_ physical representation by fiat vs nil for bitcoin.

No, sigmoidal function (as I meant it) is geometric-like in the 'toe' and 'plateau' regions and linear-like in between. If anything I'm implying we've passed the toe region and are more in a linear region, though I was really just trying to be a pedantic smart ass, since adoption like this is better modeled by a sigmoid which tapers off eventually. On mobile - is there a way to plot r/bitcoin readers over time?
