No thanks.

Why would you put it all on one? You can navigate these waters better. If 100% of your wealth is in btc AND it’s on only one ledger that’s insanity. It all comes down to personal responsibility and asset management. Only person to blame is yourself and the robber for their immoral crime. 
There is safety in cryptography and it’s 100% in your control. Can everyone handle that responsibility? I think so but they don’t educate themselves enough in most cases I’ve come across. If you mishandle your bitcoin it’s only your fault. No one can take it and no one can shut it down. It can be adopted by regulators but they can’t control it’s nature. They can control the people. They can’t control the bitcoin. It’s still early so getting in now clearly as you can tell has it’s risk and reward potential.

The real world always exists wtf are you talking about? This is cryptography not a trip to imagination land. He’s being serious with solutions to the exact problems that were mentioned. If you need someone to help you control your bitcoin then go for it. We are out here strapping up and taking time and sweat to figure this shit out so we don’t get fucked over. People want easy then wait for adoption and buy your bitcoin at 100K+ ya cucks. This is part of the early leg work that will reward you if bitcoin takes off. This is not even near it’s fullest potential. Early investors for a reason dude DYOR DYOR DYOR. 
You really compared a blown tire to cryptography? There’s nothing physical about bitcoin except hardware to store/mine it so the variables between a safe drive mechanically/human error + risk associated with failure/error and not letting someone steal your bitcoin are drastically different come on now. Been in bitcoin since 2011 and these days it’s EASY to learn how to protect your bitcoin compared to then.

Now all the people that roasted me for shining the light can kiss my correct ass.

So you got nothing else to say yet give me a downvote? Fucking joker ��

That’s a separate debate. If you’re in the animal kingdom it’s kill or be killed. If you lack understanding of the modern jungle you as a human participate in you’ll just be subject to modern darwinism. Bitcoin is an advancement like anything else. You want to keep your life and possessions learn how to protect them. There’s monsters in the jungle, life isn’t equal nor fair. What’s your village like? Feel me? Smart contracts can lock funds until all terms are complete and that’s limitless. Just sending bitcoin is outdated. Smart contracts address your concern with payments not reversed.
@_date: 2019-08-21 18:32:08
There’s a lot to consider but the opportunity to securely have your bitcoin stored exists is all I am getting at. How you do it is up to you.

Bakkt will be an authority when it comes to services provided when transacting with BTC. A payment network provider. Instant BTC to USD middleman service so that companies take cash yet you pay with your BTC. That kind of authority in the space. It’s more for adoption of BTC payments with businesses.They do not have authority over bitcoin, no one does. I thought the concern was an authority when it comes to payments. Smart contract terms can be limitless which also offers a another layer to commerce/transacting with bitcoin so you don’t get irreversibly screwed.

Like what you just said has any value whatsoever you fucking cuck.

If you can already imagine those scenarios then plan ahead it’s not that hard. You’re basically complaining about known failures in practice yet aren’t addressing them. You can in fact navigate all of those exact issues so they do not produce the same outcome.

*slow clap*

There will be an authority. For example Bakkt and Starbucks. Bakkt will swap BTC for USD instantly when you pay. So Starbucks accepts cash and you pay with BTC. Bakkt is the middleman. That groundwork is currently underway for such purposes. There is also a smart contract to consider were funds won’t be released until product is received and there’s a number of ways to validate that with current tech integrations.

Cause you’re lazy

How in the world will you get robbed of your bitcoin? If you leave cash on the table how will a central authority help you if it gets snatched? Understand the tech bro it’s multi billion dollar tech not a joke.
You store your bitcoin like a joker you’ll get robbed because you let it happen.

That’s life. You don’t prepare you lose. Assuming highschool is legitimately the same for everyone is the mind of a cuck. Congratulations that’s you. Sorry your highschool experience left you scarred and bruised but for me, I can’t even remember it cause it’s nothing compared to building a household for your ambitions.

Everyones offended by my comment? Exactly WHO do you EXPECT to save you? Fucking aye killin my karma you fucks. No one is going to save you. Not acknowledging that is stupidity at it’s finest. Everyone offering service work like a police offer, surgeon, coach, teacher, etc is doing work to add to society. That’s something to be very grateful for and appreciative because that’s the village bro. There’s people I’ve met and seen that are suffering beyond imagination or have experienced the worst. They understand the world isn’t fair and have much less opportunity. Put in work you wanks and your bitcoin is safe and transactions can be painless and you’re life protected because you fight for it.

Love that you relate!

Bitcoin is fantastic when you have these ingredients,
Smart contracts, understanding of the tech, an above average drive for self preservation, and of course some bitcoin.
