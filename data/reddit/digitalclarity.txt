Look at CoinFloor.  They have a flat rate of 5 quid + 0.38%
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:07:21
I'm in the UK, hence the late local time.

No asset that get's harmed by amateur trading has a place in this world. Chill out it's fine.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:55:54
Well I'll wait for my refund from Coinbase (that'll be the day) and do it all in one go to keep my % fee as low as poss.  Cheers for the help and have a good evening.

I've recently discovered Oppo ice-cream (full tub is 350 kcal) so that might be my answer, ha.
So Halifax don't charge to make the swift payment to the Polish account coinfloor use? (edit: I've just realised that you said transfer+£5 charge)
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:20:56
I didn't know there was a phone number!  Can you post it here?  Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:02:04
Yeah it seems so, thanks for the suggestion!  Though I wish I'd seen this 2 hours ago and saved myself £100 :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:39:27
Yeah certain times I imagine it's impossible to get through.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:41:14
Yeah but how many of these sites am I willing to transfer thousands of euros to without them being 'vouched for'?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:25:05
The problem is that in the UK our options are limited. I've tried 3 sites and coinbase is the one I could get to work with my bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:25:31
Well I held for 15 minutes the first time, hung up, then tried again later for 17 minutes!  Very polite young woman informed me it's being looked into and they've located my money.
I explained that the absence of response means I've now generated and extra support reference on the website, 2 emails and 2 phone calls just to get an update... They're multiplying their workload by not giving updates.  Anyway, let's see what happens.  Thanks again
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:14:07
Thanks, it's been a long time since I've been on my account but maybe time to fire it up again...
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:52:55
Ah well not to worry, people like this are just loud revolutionary types that want to see a total and immediate shift away from the previous system.  Coinbase has its flaws (and its fees!) but it's helped with a transition for us non-crypto expert types.
That being said it's terrible customer service motivated me to put in an afternoon's research on setting up a personal wallet.  Coins now transferred out!
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:34:29
Was on hold for 15 minutes. Hung up before my phone bill became astronomical. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:47:24
What's this?  When I google this it comes up with google pixel phones!
edit: Did you mean Google Voice/Hangouts?  In that case I installed it and will give them another go ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:53:27
Thanks for the info.  I'm in the UK, so I can call them the moment they open at 14:00 UK time.
It does make me feel slightly better that I'm not waiting a crazy amount longer than normal.  That being said BTC has increased by 1000 eur since I tried to purchase 3 weeks ago!  Suppose I'll just have to wait till the next dip...!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:57:43
Someone told me about coinfloor.  I've signed up but haven't tried it yet.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:34:19
Thanks a bunch!!  I'll let you know the outcome ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:02:24
Yeah sure, I get that.  I'll be trying elsewhere that isn't so swamped.  This three week delay has cost me around €200 in lost bitcoin value... Ah well, I'll get over it ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:49:17
Thanks for the info, I created an account to take a look!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:55:40
Yeah that's put my mind at ease, but this whole thing reminded me of that old wisdom that you shouldn't trust all your money in an exchange.  I've now been motivated to set up a private wallet to store my coins.  Coinbase has certainly lost my trust in that regard.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:56:42
I took a look but at this stage I'll be holding off as it seems relatively new to the market, as am I!  I've bookmarked your site and will go back to it at some point though. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:29:45
Just looked.  So yes I can transfer GBP, but my bank charges me £9.50 for the transfer, Coinfloor charges £5, plus the fees...  Already that's over 3% when depositing £500.  That doesn't count withdrawal fees!
Why is it so damn difficult to deposit GBP into an exchange!?  I should probably turn off the computer and have a cup of tea haha.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:13:26
Thanks.  I downloaded Jaxx and transferred some of my funds over, but now I'm reading there's an inherent security vulnerability in their Mac software.  There's no wonder crypto is mystifying the masses, I've spent countless hours reading and learning and I still have no bloody idea where I can keep them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:40:25
Yeah I appreciate this problem is not unique to myself!
