This is very different than day trading since there is nearly no risk. After each trade I re buy the coins with a 5% percent profit. The only risk is that if the price rises extremely fast I might make a deficit. That risk would disappear if I had a verified bitinstant account.

First you have to understand that the crisis the world is facing today is a global crisis, once it bursts all major currencies are gonna undergo hyperinflation and die. Pure math can tell that debt can not keep growing this fast (global debt in 2007 = 70 trillion, now = 100 trillion). Once it bursts the world will be in chaos for a few years and guess what has proven itself to be amazingly resilient ? Yes, bitcoin and gold. People will be forced to use bitcoin\gold to send cash to other countries to buy their goods and bitcoin will quickly show it's supremacy in the domain thus becoming the world currency. I would like to get into details but I am typing from my phone.

Hello Garvin,
 There is one problem that has been bugging me for some time and that is that all blocks are not created equal witch could give miners insensitive to include some transaction instead of others.  Would not it be better if the size of blocks was fixed and then if there were not enough transactions to fill the block junk would be added. I'd like to know your opinion on this.

I got hooked on bitcoin when the price was around 3 dollars a btc. I instantly knew that it was the future but I was young at the time and could not buy any BTC. I begged my father, Sisters to buy btc but they did not listen, so I figured that if I wanted to own some btc I had to buy some myself. I worked very hard on the internet spamming people with ads and succeeded buying 6 btc. I was very happy with them only that sites like SatochiDice started to become popular and so I lost all of my bitcoins gambling. So I worked harder and bought more only to gamble again. This time tho I put a limit at witch after I would stop gambling. The limit was 34 btc and so I gambled from 2 btc to 33.6 and decided to stop. My brother that was near me reminded me that I had not reached my goal yet. I started gambling again and lost everything. 
All of this was a long time ago. I have a few BTC in paper wallet now and I am not going to touch them until they are worth a few million dollars.

They can't even ban physical things like drugs. How do you expect them to ban an anonymous untraceable global internet currency ??
Example : Bob sends untraceable cryptocoins to Alice. Alice is an agent undercover and turns Bob over to the police. How does Alice proves that it is Bob that sent her the money? They can't access Bob's computer because there it is password protected. It is Alice words vs Bob's words which leads to nothing.
