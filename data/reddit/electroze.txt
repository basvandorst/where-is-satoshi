I think it's a bad idea to buy right now. It will probably crash again and keep dropping until its completely taken over by one of the other faster more efficient currencies that are actually usable. When CEOs of the crypotrading sites themselves admit how limited Bitcoin is, its a nice hint to get out of it.

I did sell right before the crash. Good luck in your hope for its arbitrary price. You'll see soon enough.

The only problem to those who think its the best crypto ever are all those who think it's not. Ultimately the price adjusts to demand and if a certain % don't think it's worth buying, then this keeps the price down even if it were the best thing ever. So, for investing purposes to buy low and sell high you're not speculating whether bitcoin is awesome or not, but rather what % of people in the future will think bitcoin is more valuable than they currently think.

Uh, computers have been out for decades before 2000. Most all schools/universities had computers in the 90s- they weren't using typewriters, lol.

Most people are using it as a pyramid scheme though- so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.

People get so caught up in claiming certain people groups are discriminated against then act all insecure if there isn't perfect % representation of each 'group'. It sure makes a great excuse. It's easier to play the victim card than to work hard and succeed. You see what you want to see and reap what you sow.

It's going to crash more, so buy at your own risk.

Game over, Bitcoin will crash now.

Governments control their currency and laws so that's kind of a big entity, not a little one.

Crypto ATMs don't all work and some try to charge $50 in fees to use, etc. Mostly useless.

If it doesn't work, it's useless.
