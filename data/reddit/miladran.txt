Don't worry man, the bankers will help us grow intentionally or unintentionally...
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:56:41
They keep the fees high intentionally.  
Stop using them...
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:46:49
 Overpay for fees
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:04:28
They can't handle the huge incoming traffic lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:13:04

19.268 sat/B is too low nowadays you have to wait for the network traffic to get lower...
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:41:07
Every exchange has it's own price based on it's supply/demand

@_date: 2018-01-04 18:53:39

TorGuard is great!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:45:17
I think blockchain.info shows the number much more than it really is intentionally
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:40:02
Mempool has more than 43k transactions i believe...
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:38:26

@_date: 2018-01-20 19:40:09
A 2MB block with only 225 transactions!!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:42:46
Segwit address start with 3
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:02:43
That's true! lol
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:02:43
50 sat/byte is enough
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:17:36
25.111 sat/B is too low nowadays, but it will get confirmed eventually

@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:39
You lose nothing unless you sell low
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:14:35
You can send transactions with much lower fees  
like $0.3-$1
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:18:00
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:28:37
IDK if they let you change the fees manually, but some other wallets do.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:45:17
My transaction got confirmed in 32 minutes with 20 sat/B  
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:04:41

@_date: 2017-11-18 14:05:19
**It's simple=&gt; limited supply and raising demand...**
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:35
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:03:22

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:34:27
Yes, why not?!  
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:14:11
While he could pay only $0.5 instead!
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:24:31
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:23:02
**It's $11,000 now**

@_date: 2017-11-12 09:20:10
Great! We are getting rid of him.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:56:47
You should move them to an online wallet (Not necessarily an exchange) to spend them.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:27:52
It would be great for segwit addoption
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:13:05
Yes with the seed you can recover your coins, but the hardware wallets protect your private keys better than the other wallets....

This is what i think:  
1. Move your BTC to another BTC wallet after the fork  
2. Claim your S2X with your old private key and transfer it to the S2X wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:16:58

Now is a good time in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-04-18 07:58:48
Sure, he could do that for $0.5 with bitcoin.

Most of the other halving date estimators use 10 minute blocks to calculate the estimated halving date.
Blocks, however, have been mined at less than 10 minute intervals for almost all of Bitcoin's history.
Our calculator uses data from Bitcoinity to get the average block time for the past 6 months. It then uses this block time (currently 9.308 minutes between blocks) to estimate the halving date.
While most of the other sites estimate the halving for late-May, the more likely outcome is an early-May reward halving.

you don't need 3 hardware wallets, you can make 3 accounts on 1 wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:25:23
Move your bitcoins to somewhere which you can access your private keys
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:24:15
if there is a private key, you can use it on blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:31:22
bitfinex.com is pretty fast

@_date: 2017-09-25 14:36:58
Best option is to move your coins to hardware or paper wallet.  
Otherwise find wallets which will support the split and move your coins there...
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:33:43
Yes, more free coins to dump for the real BTC
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:39:30

@_date: 2019-09-08 09:48:38
Reaching your wallet is different than getting confirmed.  
Transactions are instant and will appear in your wallet instantly but the confirmation takes a bit of time depending on the paid fee
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:13:26
No you can always recover your coins using your 12/24 recovery words.

@_date: 2017-05-10 07:04:30
It's not too late yet.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:51:23
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:05:03
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:26:32

@_date: 2017-05-26 07:28:10

@_date: 2017-05-25 17:11:06
Don't worry it will recover.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:57:27

He is not a pure Hodler lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:33

Never sell all your stock at once...
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:08:51
I'll never sell any BTC to buy alts...
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:57:59
$10k maybe
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:04:22
Paper wallet
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:46:00
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:27:03
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:46:38
Yes, sell all your coins....
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:18:51
i can do custom fees on blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:09:54
Because there are 86k unconfirmed transactions in queue...
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:11:08
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:59:50
They have no value until they spend them and when they spend them redistribution will happen.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:29:38
No spams.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:59:18
I suggest you to read this page:  
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:31:51
Yes i have the same problem, my email is yahoo.
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:30:22
If you want to buy cheap, now is a good time imo
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:55:18
Someone has sent him one whole Bitcoin!:  
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:46:45
Unconfirmed transactions can get charged back (Double spend)
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:18:45
Me too  
Still holding...
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:52:56
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:40:16
Last chances to buy below $3000
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:10:57
maybe you have too many inputs...
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:57:19
buying bitcoins everyday is the best investment....
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:14:16
$13 fee is nothing for a $518k transaction lol  
although they could do it with $0.2 fees
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:59:47
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:09:40
yes, me
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:36:54
then 100k lol
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:10:03
2nd best time to buy is Right Now.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:20:54
Your port 8333 is probably not open  
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:43:32
THAT'S NOT BITCOIN CASH....
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:12:48
We still have a loooong way to reach the moooooon
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:53:48
YES if bitcoin goes under $1k
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:59:42
It's a digital currency that has demand, everything with demand will get valuable specially when the supply is limited.  
That's it.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:35:25
I'll buy all at $2, so there will be no BTC remaining for you at $1 :D
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:43:51
Works fine for me!
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:38:04
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:24:05
I sent him $2 :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:23:43
my transactions are not showing on blockchain too, never had this much delay with coinbase!
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:11:53
Because the mempool is empty, no spam.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:17:26
I have 3 pending transactions for 1-2 so far.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:42:18
i think they have mobile app too
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:08:09
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:13:02
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:10:25

@_date: 2017-07-21 13:44:49
NOW is always a good time to buy
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:02:39
Mooon, either way
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:52:03
I see the future...
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:50:17
it's already less than $1  
you can send transactions with $0.2 and get confirmations fast
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:30:21
yes its usually instant but today idk wtf is wrong with them
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:03:21
because they are stupid.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:33:58
It's a good time to buy
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:39:11
You can check transactions confirmation on blockchain.info  
It's safe once it gets 3 confirmation. higher fees=faster confirmation.
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:52:03
