We are using the Indiegogo as a means of raising initial funds and distributing tokens to our early supporters! The goal is uncapped so $100k AUD is the minimum we need to have a functioning prototype out. We already have a team working on initial development. We've already secured VC funding and partnerships to help make this payment network a reality!

we're securing partnerships with merchants to ensure you can use our wallet in store. We also enable NFC payments for any cryptocurrencies or cryptographic items on our network :) The main issue with crypto right now is that it has no real world use \- we're hoping to make it more accessible for your average person

I’m well aware you CAN live on BTC it’s just not as practical as it could be, certainly not for your everyday person. We’re enabling NFC payments for cryptocurrencies, leveraging a technology that everyday people know AND use for payments already. Touch is not a financial institution, simply a wallet enabling ANYONE to use cryptocurrencies via NFC. We don’t hold your private keys or collect any user data.

Your advice is greatly appreciated! I can assure you we share your view on this - but we are not and will not act as a bank. We will prove we don’t hold your private keys or collect data when our app is out! That’s our number one priority - to provide a truly decentralised financial service

We're constructing a HD wallet to hold all different cryptocurrencies! The wallet will function as a light node :)
