No, the printing press will continue adding new money to the existing supply forever, all it needs is ink and paper.  The bitcoin miner will eventually run out of new bitcoins to add to the existing supply and even with all the energy in the universe it could not print another coin.

This is a fiat currency problem.  All governments print their money out of nothing, enriching the printers and stealing the wealth of their citizens.  Voting does nothing to change that. 


Not true.  Money was issued in the past in weights of gold or silver and it was honest, there was no way to debase it without fraud, it was not printed out of nothing.  That was all gradually abandoned when we as a society transitioned to paper money with the intent to enrich the printers at the expense of the savers. 


No one prints gold in a similar manner that no one prints bitcoin.  They may stamp gold into pretty circles with faces on them but that is not the same as printing it out of thin air, they have to put in the work to extract it out of the earth and no amount of work can create new gold out of nothing as a finite quantity exists and that cannot be changed.  Not true for paper money.

Capitalism works just fine when based on sound money.    


That's the beauty of it, it has already happened!  Fiat currencies are now forced to compete against sound money on global markets!  Those who choose hard money will be greatly rewarded over time while those who choose to store the proceeds of their productive labor in a money which can be printed infinitely will find themselves becoming impoverished over a long enough time horizon.  Rational self interest will eventually drive the entire world economy into bitcoin and it will be a new renaissance age for humanity.

One reason I have never added gold to my portfolio is dont you lose like 5-10% from spot every time you need to convert it to and from dollars?  I mean the gold dealer needs to make a profit too and they dont accept gold nuggets at the grocery store so you need to convert.  If you need liquidity in less than 5-10 years it seems better to just hold cash so you dont lose that percentage going back and forth to cash.  Not to mention doubt about assay and the cost of physical security.  Just doesn't seem worth it imo.  Bitcoin on the other hand...

Fiat currencies will all collapse eventually through hyperinflation as the temptation to devalue the currency (and associated debt obligations) through printing is just too great.  
This process should be accelerated by Bitcoin as an unstoppable alternative store of value by causing [speculative attacks]( on all fiat (I give a rough estimate of 50 years perhaps a lot sooner).  
As they hyperinflate and collapse Bitcoin price in each fiat currency should approach infinity (i.e. how many Zimbabwe dollars is a bitcoin worth?   Near infinite as it is no longer in circulation and only has collectible value).  
Eventually all fiat currencies will have failed (including the dollar but it will probably be the last one as they will start to fail weakest first like Venezuela) and bitcoin is the only global unit of account, meaning nothing is priced in dollars or euros anymore as they no longer exist, everything is priced in bitcoin and there is no other frame of reference to price things in other than perhaps gold (but hey we're talking like 2070 at this point and who wants to pay for things with a shiny rock when we have augmented reality built into our vision or whatever cypherpunk future we are living in at the time).  
As these currencies fail Bitcoins value should increase in value faster and faster asymptotically approaching infinity when priced in fiat terms until people stop using the fiat currency as it is seen as worthless (a wheelbarrow of money to buy a loaf a bread, etc.) at which point there is no objective way to measure BTC value in the failed fiat and BTC becomes a unit of account.     
At that point the purchasing power of bitcoin would continue to grow but at a decreasing rate until it has absorbed all store of value function for the entire planet and settled at a "stable" final price and would then only grow or shrink in relation to global production output.  This is the latter half, [flattening of the S-curve after universal adoption]( but we have not even hit the inflection point yet so there is many orders of magnitude of growth remaining before that point.

You are correct that Bitcoin can be divided further than the satoshi with a fork but incorrect about it causing inflation.  That is like saying that by cutting a pie into smaller and smaller pieces you are somehow creating more pie.  It doesn't work like that, the total supply of Bitcoin is still capped at 21 million even if you make the satoshi more divisible.  
The fed adjusting the money supply to their inflation target by creating more money (pie) out of thin air dilutes the value of everyones savings in dollars.  That is not possible with bitcoin.
Also there is no such thing as a "healthy ~3% inflation level". You have swallowed Keynesian talking points, read The Bitcoin Standard.

If weak fiat currencies hyperinflate and fail one after the other until it finally cascades into the hyperinflation and collapse of the USD then the price of Bitcoin in dollars will go asymptotic and be literally infinite and meaningless as the USD will no longer have value or exist in any meaningful form and everything will just be priced in satoshis. It doesn't require infinite assets to achieve this, just hyperinflation of fiat until it collapses.

I was motivated by the fact that it is a scarce and useful resource for value preservation that is immutable and cannot be shut down.  Given we live in a world of unlimited fiat printing eroding savers wealth storage ability the potential demand for access to something deflationary, global, liquid and unconfiscatable is enormous.  Combine that with limited supply and you have the recipe for an asset with with the best risk/reward ratio the world has ever seen.  This is the investment opportunity of a lifetime if not a millennium.  I understood this in 2013 so the only problem I have with hodling is when I literally have run out of fiat for living expenses and need to part with some of my precious bitcoin  :`(

Yes that is the way it has always operated in the past because the citizens of that country had no alternative to the government mandated fiat currency except perhaps to horde gold however even that was able to be confiscated and not able to be used for global commerce.  
We are operating in an entirely different world though now that bitcoin exists.  People finally are able to exit the current system to protect the product of their labor.  And [free market competition]( between currencies will eventually drive the value of each fiat to zero, starting with the weakest but working its way up until even the almighty dollar is brought to an end.

I know, that's why you put all your living expenses on credit cards (which do go away with bankruptcy) while paying everything you earn to eliminating your student loan debt.  Once your student loan debt is paid off, declare bankruptcy for credit card debt.  
Note: not necessarily advising this route as bankruptcy also has many drawbacks, just saying it is one option for eliminating student loans which will otherwise follow you forever.

is correct.  If over the next year a ton of new miners joined the network and hashpower increased by 10x or 100x the rate of creation of new blocks would still stay at approximately 1 block every 10 minutes.  Block rate creation is regulated by algorithm and is independent of mining power.  
Those billion transactions can either (1) increase the fee they are willing to pay in order to incentivise miners to choose their transaction first or (2) they can join the mempool to wait until miners have cleared out the higher fee transactions after which they will be processed as they are now the highest fee (this could take a while depending on network demand especially for a billion transactions which is why layer 2 scaling like the lightning network is so important).  Throughput does not change no matter how many miners are processing transactions because the difficulty to find a block is dynamic and adjusts based on current mining power to keep blocks coming in at ~10 minutes per block on average.  Even if every miner except for one dropped out transactions would still be processed at the same rate, the only thing that would change is the security of the network (it would be very easy to 51% attack and not very valuable due to that fact).  
That is why it is recommended that you increase your fee for high priority transactions because otherwise you may have to wait a while for higher fee transactions to be confirmed before your transaction is included in a block.

If I can get hypothetical for a second...
Since fiat currencies are not backed by anything, even gold anymore, they should all collapse eventually through hyperinflation (including the dollar but it will probably be the last one as they will start to fail weakest first like Venezuela).  
This process should be accelerated by Bitcoin as an unstoppable alternative store of value by causing [speculative attacks]( on all fiat (I give a rough estimate of 50 years perhaps a lot sooner).  
As they hyperinflate and collapse Bitcoin price in each fiat currency should approach infinity (i.e. how many Zimbabwe dollars is a bitcoin worth?   Near infinite as it is no longer in circulation and only has collectible value).  
Eventually all fiat currencies will have failed and bitcoin is the only global unit of account, meaning nothing is priced in dollars or euros anymore as they no longer exist, everything is priced in bitcoin and there is no other frame of reference other than perhaps gold (but hey we're talking like 2070 at this point and who wants to pay for things with a shiny rock when we have augmented reality built into our vision or whatever cypherpunk future we are living in at the time).  


If anything as these currencies fail Bitcoins value should increase in value faster and faster asymptotically approaching infinity when priced in fiat terms until people stop using the fiat currency as it is seen as worthless (a wheelbarrow of money to buy a loaf a bread, etc.) at which point there is no objective way to measure BTC value in the failed fiat.   
How do you then explain the price growth slowing down over time?  If anything it should accelerate as these currencies fail.  The only way I can see it is after all fiat has failed and bitcoin is the single global unit of account then at that point the purchasing power of bitcoin would continue to grow but at a decreasing rate until it has absorbed all store of value for the entire planet and settled at a "stable" final price when would then only grow or shrink in relation to global production output.  This is the latter half, [flattening of the S-curve after universal adoption]( but we have not even hit the inflection point yet so there is many orders of magnitude of growth remaining before that point.  
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:52:33
Since fiat currencies are not backed by anything, even gold anymore, they should all collapse eventually through hyperinflation as the temptation to devalue the currency (and associated debt obligations) through printing is just too great.

Eventually all fiat currencies will have failed (including the dollar but it will probably be the last one as they will start to fail weakest first like Venezuela) and bitcoin is the only global unit of account, meaning nothing is priced in dollars or euros anymore as they no longer exist, everything is priced in bitcoin and there is no other frame of reference to price things in other than perhaps gold (but hey we're talking like 2070 at this point and who wants to pay for things with a shiny rock when we have augmented reality built into our vision or whatever cypherpunk future we are living in at the time).  
As these currencies fail Bitcoins value should increase in value faster and faster asymptotically approaching infinity when priced in fiat terms until people stop using the fiat currency as it is seen as worthless (a wheelbarrow of money to buy a loaf a bread, etc.) at which point there is no objective way to measure BTC value in the failed fiat.   
Once all fiat currencies have failed Bitcoin will be the single global unit of account then at that point the purchasing power of bitcoin would continue to grow but at a decreasing rate until it has absorbed all store of value function for the entire planet and settled at a "stable" final price and would then only grow or shrink in relation to global production output.  This is the latter half, [flattening of the S-curve after universal adoption]( but we have not even hit the inflection point yet so there is many orders of magnitude of growth remaining before that point.

First discovered bitcoin in 2012 after getting some MDMA at a phish show and having my mind blown, never realized happiness like that was possible.  Wanted to buy some so went to and saw a link to on the sidebar, began following the subreddit casually until 2013 when it finally clicked how huge it was going to be, went all in and haven't looked back except to wish I had backed up the truck in 2012 when I first discovered it at $8.

I agree but it will resolve itself over a longer timeline through scarcity, perhaps longer than our lifetimes but I am ok with that.

I think blockchain based governance would be a huge improvement and shine a spotlight on government accountability by finally allowing full auditing of all government functions.  
Nothing is more important than money though as it is the basis on which all commerce and governance is built.  You have to fix that first before you can fix the rest.

Yes this is valid.  Debt is fine as long as you can earn more on your investments than you pay on interest.  I personally use debt to avoid spending my BTC, then pay off the debt during bull runs.

It doesn't matter at all whether he believes in it or not, it will continue working regardless.  [People who choose to store the product of their labor in harder money will benefit at the expense of those who choose to store their wealth in weaker forms of money](  Eventually those who store their wealth in inflationary fiat currencies will be forced to adopt bitcoin just to protect their purchasing power and feed their families, all without requiring any understanding of proof of work.  
No country backs their currency with anything other than threat of violence.

Central banks continue printing indefinitely because they have no other choice.
Those who hold bitcoin become incredibly wealthy in fiat terms.
Those who hold fiat lose purchasing power every year to the point they have great difficulty meeting even their basic survival needs.
All fiat currencies eventually suffer hyperinflationary collapse due to the black hole effect of bitcoin as a SoV.
There is now a single global borderless currency of the people, Bitcoin.
Many who relied on safety nets and fiat savings suffer during the transition but society as a whole is immeasurably better off in the long run with an economy based on sound money and low time preference. 
Society enters a new renaissance age built on the ashes of the current system.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:36:18


No, for the first time we finally have free market alternative to fiat currencies.  The economic incentives with holding a deflationary currency as opposed to an inflationary one will eventually drive the dollar to zero.  


And they will continue to be created daily.  None of them have an effect on bitcoin's scarcity however and come nowhere near to its security as shown by proof of work.  


It's market price disagrees with you.


None of which matters.  Adoption will happen regardless of whether we are meanies or not.

This is correct.  Bitcoin is not infinitely scaleable on the base layer and no one who ever understood the reason for it's existence ever claimed it to be.  That is why scaling is being moved to layer 2/3, sidechains, etc.  It is not feasible to have global throughput on the main chain while maintaining decentralization.  If your transaction is high priority and there is a backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed you have to raise your fee to outbid the other transactions, it is that way by design.  


Again the throughput rate is independent of the number or power of miners due to the difficulty adjustment keeping blocks coming every 10 minutes.  There could be 1 miner or a billion miners, it makes no difference to the ability of the main chain to scale or how fast blocks will confirm.
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:48:59
IRS has plenty of power to enforce.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:17:04
Throughput is unchanged vs the number of miners.

A bear market is when the price has been going down for an extended period of time.  A bull market is the opposite.

My personal recommendation is to stay away from trading.  Accumulate as much bitcoin as you can by working for it or by savings and hold on to it for 3-5+ years with no expectation of selling and by that point you will probably be very happy with your decision.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:58:56
There will be reversible settlement layers built on top of bitcoin that these ppl can use.  Essentially bitcoin banks that have clearing between themselves with time delayed settlement before broadcasting to the blockchain allowing arbitration and reversal.

Can you rephrase your question?  Maybe I can help explain.  
Also, even if every bitcoin in existence except for one was lost/destroyed that one bitcoin would still be enough to handle the entire world economy, its price would swell to astronomical levels but it is essentially infinitely divisible and would still be able to be used for micro transactions.

From their site;


Yes! Because Opendime emulates a tiny USB flash drive, most devices can read it already. Inside, you'll find text files with the payment address, and if unsealed, the private key in WIF format. We also provide a QR image that is easily scanned. You can also use a USB phone charger, or USB power pack, to check if it's unsealed: plug it into any USB port, and the lights flash in a pattern that indicate it's status.
There are simple [foldable solar arrays]( that can power a phone during a grid outage.

Better to buy during a bear market than during a bull but dollar cost averaging into the market is advised for risk minimization.  Most newbies just FOMO and buy in during big rises in the bull market though.

Every time you sell it has to continue drop at least another 15% for long term capital gains, like 25% for short term just for you to break even when you buy back.  Hard to time and not worth the risk for many, hodling can be challenging but is much easier for many and never results in ending up will less BTC.
