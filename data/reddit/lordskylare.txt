I stand corrected then. I got mislead by lack of info about this matter on r/btc sub so i just assumed they are not affected. Sorry.

The bug is far more serious, it let's you double-spend funds.

covert (hidden one) is.

as far i'm aware BCH is only affected by the crash bug, not by the double-spend bug.

Supposedly. There's no proof that every USDT is backed by USD 1:1

1. The code itself has a programmed way to ensure that average time between blocks is 10 minutes. It is done by adjusting "target" value which is the highest value a blocks header hash may be. So when the "target" gets smaller the difficulty to create new block gets bigger. It is done every 2016 blocks, whic is 20160 minutes or 336 hours or 14 days or 2 weeks on average.
2. They are being created by providing miners a "target" value, bitcoin code doesn't care how do you calculate the hash itself.
3. It is possible, but it would create a hard fork because it loosens the rules. The fork would create a new chain with new protocol rules. The miners would then vote by simply choosing to mine or not to mine the new blocks.  
Additionaly it is helpful to think of mining a new blocks not as a "problem" which you "solve" but as a lottery which gets harder the more people get in.

"Altcoins - refers to any coin that isn't crypto" What?

(almost) nothing.

You can lock away bitcoin too, and it's easier because you're not limited by the asset volume like with gold.

ABC added checkpoints tho.

Banks in '08 thought the same about themselves... The difference is nobody is gonna do a bail-out for Bitcoin.

It's more complicated than that for shops because they want actual money and not crypto so you need thing like automatic conversion to cash &amp; frequent price updates to minimise risk.
