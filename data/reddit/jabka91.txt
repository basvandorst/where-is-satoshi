Hi guys,
I was wondering if its possible to set a minimum and maximum sell price on binance that will automatically sell if either price is reached. For example if I want to sell my coin for minimum 0.00011834 and maximum for 0.00018900. It will be great if I could set up something like this so that it can take care of itself while am at work.

Is my ledger naos s hacked? I am trying to transfer some btc from my ledger nano s to an ICO. What happens is that it asks me to confirm output 1 which is the amount I want to send plus the adress. Now comes the suspicious part. It asks me to confirme output 2 which is 0,8 BTC to an unknown adress that I did not put in. I have closed everything and restarted but still same thing is happening. Anybody knows whats going on?

Nice. But can non-indians trade there? And how can we withdraw our funds later? Any tax issues?
