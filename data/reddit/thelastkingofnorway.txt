So I get the appeal for Bitcoin as a currency but in my mind this make it's current vehicle as an investment a bad idea. People seem to be obsessed with the value of a bitcoin but if it's not stable, and if the movement of the currency is not liquid, then it won't fulfil that future. How useful is Bitcoin as a replacement for a fiat currency when it's exchange rate is so high?  
Another question I have is how do represent expanding value with a finite currency or is the idea Bitcoin just continues to divide it's units?

Cheers. I'll make a note of it (well, save your comment).

This is probably me too.
I didn't invest in Bitcoin because whilst I understand, to a point, blockchain as a technology I don't understand Bitcoin as a currency or an investment. It seems too volatile for a currency and I still can't see it's value of an investment. 
I told my friends this and they would not accept it continually to go on and on about how it's an investment. I have a pension invested in a stock market fund and their argument was the stock market is just as risky as Bitcoin which I didn't really accept. They also said that Bitcoin is no different to fiat currency in that it's made up which seems to miss my point about it.

As a casual observer it seems thats the posts are bullish but the comments are far more balanced if not bearish. It's very weird.

Can something be overvalued when it's value seems to derive from speculation?

None of those reached &lt;10%. 
That said I don't think Bitcoin compares to any of them. People are behaving as if Bitcoin were a stock market and stock markets should rebound but this isn't the stock market and who knows if that will happen? The December rally could be an aberration, we've seen those happen before too, and it will never recover. Maybe by the end of the month it will hit $20,000. Who knows?

Serious question from an admitted skeptic: Where do you see the long-term value from Bitcoin coming? 
I see the appeal of cryptocurrency but anything people are encouraged to horde or that has so much violitality is not a good currency. 
And with no revenue stream coming for holding a unit and little value as commodity I don't understand where the worth comes from?

I do get the appeal for it as a currency.
My issue though is people telling me what a great investment it is and I do not understand why. They keep telling me the benefits of it as a currency too but I don't *invest* in currencies on the assumption it's going to double. If a fiat currency behaved like this people would shit themselves.

Yeah and again I am totally with the technology and the idea of a decentralised currency. I do wonder about a currency that has a finite  amount of value, surely it's an advantage that fiat currency can expand to reflect economic growth, but I am not an economist so I dunno. 
I can see the idea that if Bitcoin becomes a major currency and/or is the backing currency for other cryptocurrencies then getting in early and owning a lot will be good. I guess though ironically that speculation is harming that goal at the moment.  
I might buy a very small amount just to see what it's like.

Doesn't the concept of worrying about the price range undermine Bitcoin's ability to succeed? For all the talk of people who want it for ideological reasons it seems most want to make them a fuck-ton of money.

Well you invest to increase your investment. The question is why Bitcoin will increase in price other than speculation. Liking the idea and the technology is not the same as thinking a unit of Bitcoin should increase, if anything fans of the idea should desire stability in the price as getting rich by buying it early is not the primary purpose of Bitcoin. 
To me the technology and idea is a different question to it as an investment.
