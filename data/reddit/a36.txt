I would suggest internet of money by Andreas followed by Mastering Bitcoin if you are interested in the technicals. This is for someone who wants to develop at the protocol level and not targeted for beginners

Intel SGX is probably what is being referred to here

1. open an account with bittrex, setup 2FA and complete validations
2. Send ETH/BTC/LTC from coinbase to the right wallet in bittrex
3. If LTC/ETH - Sell them for BTC
4. Buy OMG

can you be a bit more clear about your question ?
