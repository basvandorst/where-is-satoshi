Ok, it worked. 
IS GOOD.
Fuck my paranoia is running high after all this. What a roller coaster

You can't understand basic vocabulary... average buttcoiner.

Not me :)

Lol you're such a moron, hope you lose all your cash trust fund baby

Ah you're right. I knew something was off because their market capitalization definitely went up drastically. Thanks.
Truthfully I don't really care about bitcoin at all any more. I made money and am out of it entirely now.

Lol you bought at 1100. Cost averaging is moronic on speculative instruments you know?

I doubt anyone hacking amazon for payment details is going to make 5 million cash with the only obstacle being cashing out. They'd have to resell the information to individual carders or more likely sell it to the resellers which is even cheaper

Considering they could be phantom trading this entire time, yes this seems plausible at the very least.

How long is it taking for people to withdraw? My funds are not going through. Been waiting 30+ minutes for my BTC to withdraw

The fact that this kind of content is well received is extremely telling about this community. Who. Cares.

Withdrawal Status: waiting to be processed.
NOT GOOD

It's a joke of a currency that's why. It should have never gone above $50 a coin

22 dollars went to 110. That's nothing like buying 1000 bitcoins for $3000 and have it turn into 300 000. You could have bought it even cheaper if you knew it would succeed because you had appropriate connections to pump and dump it.
Your timeline is all fucky too, it took 35 years to see that 500% gain whereas the early bitcoin adopters could have seen &gt;10000% in 6 years
