Could you hire a skilled worker for 0.00003600 per hour, at any point in the future?
In the past I would have said no to:
* 36₿/hr
* 3.6₿/hr
* 0.36₿/hr
* 0.036₿/hr
* 0.0036₿/hr ($14hr now)
So to consider the following now
* 0.00036₿/hr
* 0.000036₿/hr
Seems reasonable.

no need, lightning network does this already.

somewhere between 7 million and 100 million per coin, even at roughly 8% replacement you can expect bit/dollar parity, satoshi/cent parity.

\&gt; just playing with numbers
Exactly, just considering possibilities and what happens over time.
It is clear to me that bitcoin is not going anywhere, and that for all the market cycles people are using it, so what does happen as adoption grows. If, or when, we reach a point where it is normal to buy a property with bitcoin, and to be paid in it, what does that look like, what are the numbers.
At some point a fiat value will be near irrelevant if we reach certain tipping points, prices for things will be in btc, what will they be.
9 years ago I was discarding or giving away 50+ at a time. I have used and stopped several times over the past decade, and every time I enter again, what I had previously is unattainable. So what is the opposite view, what is the smallest unit of account, 1 satoshi, and does it being useful seem like a pipe dream or a reality.
What I'm finding, within myself, that even a single satoshi may be more like a dollar than a cent. Also that spare change today,  may be a weeks wage in a generation or less.
21 million, is a very smaller number on a global economic scale.

we cycle through money, enough for one year is a conservative place to start, say WORLD GDP at 127T / 18.5M BTC = 6.8M

lightning network interfacing with application code on the web to provide massively scalable payment network atop existing networks and bitcoin is the novel part to highlight

Here is the [original idea]( I posted, which others turned in to proof of keys. In this context, you could remove your bitcoin today, then decide tomorrow how much to send back to continue receiving the service. If all users of the service take the same action today, then it acts like an audit of the service, and allows you all, together, to prove the service you are using is trustworthy.

LND has a cap of 0.16 max channel and payment size for now, IIRC.

A couple of days ago I was thinking about wages of [1 satoshi per second]( that's 3600 per hour, and here you guys are on 15 times less.

That would raise many many questions, would it not. Do we say let's not uncover wrongdoings, for fear of what we may find out?
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:04:50
More coins may be thought to be owned than exist, yet "Do I own Bitcoin?" is not the only question to answer.
"is our money being used, if so, for what?" is also a question, by withdrawing our money, we can say no it is not.
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:52:08


It is, and that's why I changed the wording this time


as above.


Yes, always.

\&gt;  as a scaling solution 
It is an effective scaling solution, we do not need only one, there can be many.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:44:34
Yes, this is preferable. The idea is to have a day where exchanges have as close to zero user bitcoin as possible. As another user said, a crowdsourced audit.
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:11:49
It is less expensive, than finding you have none.
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:17:44
a larger proportion of the marketplace, which includes higher volume exchanges.
or ask the other question, why do they not already?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:56:30
Suppose just two of the top 50 exchanges utilize \~1% of the BTC they hold, and use it for market manipulation purposes. Coinbase cold wallet is roughly 865,000. Let us say this gives just two players around 15,000 BTC to adjust markets at will.
Now, that is only based on 2 of the top 50 exchanges using under 1% of the BTC they hold.
Do you see the issue?

The time, 03/Jan/2019 16:00 UTC, is important.
If a trusted agent holds 100,000 BTC, and they show us 1,000 BTC each day for 100 days, we can only assert that they have 1% of what they should.
If however we all take control of what portion is ours, such that at a particular moment the trusted agent does not hold any of our money, then we can say yes, we trust you.
If they cannot supply all of the money which they hold for us, then we can say no, we do not trust you, and begin the process of asking further questions.
The time, is important.

That is sad, perhaps even wrong.
I wonder if the fee is more or less than the fees from a days trading, presuming that is why the coins are being kept there.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:14:39
Yes, exactly.

Perfect choice of words. Thank you.

Look at the size of the cold storage wallets.
