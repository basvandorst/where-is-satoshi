Next time before you spam your blog post in every crypto sub, learn to write.  My god it was painful trying to read it.  Also, why would you think we care to know that you're bad with money?

There is a list.  They are called maintainers.  It's not public who these people are.  There are definitely permissions. One of these is the ability to merge code into the repo.  The link you provided is people who submitted code to possibly be used.

Thanks for that.  Is there a review process for who gets permissions?  It's up to Wladimir's discretion?  It seems someone else added their key without any reasoning.  So he was a maintainer but Lopp didn't know?  It's good to know they can't change the code though without making themselves public.

Could be a lack of purpose in life.  Could be lack of social skills.  Who else posts on internet forums?  Oh dear god...

I hope you lose it all

Any evidence of this?

Is this assuming that new money comes in at the same rate as in the past?
Is it also assuming that transaction volumes stays the same?

Why do you know how to do this?  Something you learned for work or as a hobby?

You can review the contract terms and if you feel they were frozen unfairly, you can go to court.
Of course you know this.
I'm am just confused why you're lying about it.

Depends on the contract.  You can not have the keys, and still purchase bitcoin.  You agree to them holding it for you.  Several companies offer this.  There are convenience and legal reasons why this exists.
The people who say "Not your keys, not your bitcoin"  mean you have no entitlement to the value of your investment if you don't have the private key.  It's a silly statement.

Why do people keep repeating this?  That's not how property rights work.  It's weird that you're pretending that ownership automatically changes to whoever knows your private key.

Do you think the Mt. Gox costumers should be repaid?

That seems like the most narcissistic thing a person could ever say.  Well done.

You are adorable

chiefy81 said if an individual human doesn't value something, then it is worthless. 
I think ignoring a world full of living things that may value something you don't is the most narcissistic thing I've ever heard.  I personally have noticed some dogs like eating poop, but I don't.  I'm being honest with you here, I really don't don't value eating poop.  However, I have seen with my own eyes a dog valuing it.
It's ridiculous to have to explain this.
