While Kraken does not charge for a EUR SEPA deposits, sometimes a bank transfer is done via an intermediary bank and the intermediary bank may charge an extra fee. We are not responsible for any fees charged by your bank or by an intermediary bank, and cannot know or inform you of these costs in advance, as we do not control these extra costs. Also, as someone else in this thread mentioned, it's entirely possible that your bank charged you for the GBP &gt; EUR conversion before sending out your transfer.
For more information on this matter, please see the below support article on our website:

Multiple teams work on the support channels which are available for people to use. You are free to reach out on Reddit but for specific support requests (such as this case) we will usually ask you to open up a support request through the link that I posted above. I can assure you that opening a ticket through the website will receive an equal amount of attention vs. posting on Reddit.
