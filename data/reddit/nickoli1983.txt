At current prices, I'd probably sell it... if it drops substantially once all the coinbase funds are released I might buy a few just as a longterm hedge, but it would have to drop A LOT.

No I mean if you exchange one coin for another (btc -&gt;eth) that very well may be a taxable event and you have to pay taxes on your gains at that point. I’m still working this out myself with my tax guy but I think that’s where it’s gonna land. 
Ideally you could do a 1031 like property transfer but I’m not sure. That’s what I would like to do as well but it seems like a trade is a taxable event.

Ultimately you should make sure you have a tax professional helping you with it. I’ve thought about it a lot and happened to know someone who was an IRS attorney for years. His basic position on this was that you should always take as aggressive of a position as possible on your taxes assuming you have grounds to do so. Document everything well and don’t try to hide it obviously and know that you may have to ultimately come up with the cash, but 95% of the time it probably won’t even be reviewed. 
If you file as trades and recognize the income, there is 0% chance the IRS says hey. You overpaid you could’ve made these like-kind exchanges, here’s a bunch of money back!
So ya. I know that going forward the new law makes it clear but I’m filing my trades in 2017 as like-kind which is definitely an aggressive argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:50

If you've ever had to call 911 because your kid is convulsing on the ground and the fire dept. and paramedics show up within a minute, you might reconsider the role of taxes. 
There was no bill in a stressful moment for my family (although there would've been if we had to take an ambulance). 
If you don't think this sort of service has a place in a modern society than you should probably move to a secluded island or deep wilderness. 
So yea. When I cash out my coin to fiat, I pay taxes on it. Not more or less than I should. Gladly.

What do you consider a major change?
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:45:08
To answer your question, you would limit the number of entries because it makes it seem more legitimate. 
If what you say is true and you've made more money off of alt coins than you can spend in a lifetime, why don't you just post a new thread with a new raffle that allows people to comment with a receiving BTC address and you pick one or a bunch and giveaway as much as you feel comfortable with? That would spread real karma and be an amazing venture. 
Asking people to buy-in to "get lucky" is pretty much the oldest scam in the book man. Even if you're actually trying to do this legit, IT STICKS and I would discourage anyone from participating.
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:16:50

@_date: 2017-08-30 02:32:17
You're not being a dick either but it's just a basic math question man. Let's round up and say you own .005 of a BTC. If BTC goes up $100 you move the decimal place 2 spots over (multiplication) and you've made 50 cents. Which is the answer. If BTC goes up $1000, you move it one more. You make $5. If it goes up $10,000, you make $50. 
See what I did there?
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:03:32

@_date: 2017-08-08 01:22:34
Even if this were legit (it's certainly not), this isn't a raffle, it's a lottery. A raffle would be if you gave away the tickets for free or for a simple sign up or something. You are asking people to buy into it which is a lottery which are always terrible scams.

I posted this morning on transaction fees and it went from 40ish upvotes and a really healthy discussion in the comments to zero upvotes and dead in a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:29:59
I live in the US and used bittrex for this exact thing... worked fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:45:44
I was sincerely hoping to avoid discussing Bcash. My point was to simply prove that transaction fees are NOT nearly as high as they are being reported and people should calm down about it.
Ultimately yes... there are many alts that have super cheap transaction costs. In my opinion, transaction costs shouldn't be the primary concern for a cryptocurrency. I'm more concerned with decentralization, liquidity, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:23:42
That's about a .5% fee on the transaction. I agree maybe a bit high in the crypto world, but low in the banking world. What would be a reasonable fee to you?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:09:56
What’s the evidence that bcash has widespread use?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:32:34
For me, this settled the debate once and for all between these two.
Want to install a FULL NODE for Bitcoin? Cool. Go to bitcoin.org and there are instructions to walk you through it...
Want to install a FULL NODE for Bcash (BCH)? Ya can't. You can "purchase" hash power in a mining pool, but there's no software you can install that will let you run and verify transactions on your own rig. 
Bcash is pretty much the definition of centralized. I'm not really sure what else there is to debate on the subject.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:43:29
Okay... I consider myself semi-tech savvy. Can someone ELI10 to me?

@_date: 2017-11-17 15:47:59
I don't know man... that's a tough one. I think if you want to have a solid relationship with this woman (maybe that's not a given...), you probably need to A) tell her B) come up with a long term plan.
I think it would be pretty responsible to cash out a small portion of this to buy a house in cash. That's a great weight lifted off your shoulders long term and also diversifies your investments. 
I think it would probably be irresponsible to suggest that either of you can coast and quit your jobs for the reason you state (it could go to 1K... who knows.)
CONGRATS though. That's an awesome story.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:56:57
Damn man. I really hope this gets resolved for you. That’s insane. 
I transferred 100 ARK off of bittrex today. That’s how much I trust them.

Already down to 170K... clearing fast it seems like. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:25:04
That's a pretty big assumption. I'm an active user of ETH, ARK, VTC, NEO, and XRP. 
My point was that the transaction fees were much lower than the scary averages being written about ($20/transaction etc.) 
I agree that BTC price could be lowered.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:49:20
I didn't say they are okay right now. They are at an all time high. I say in the post we should work to lower them. My point was that they are drastically LOWER than the reported fees. Nobody should be paying $20 to send bitcoin. That's total FUD.
I agree that this will ultimately be solved though. In a few years, we will look back at the crazy transaction fee bubble of 2017.

I've seen this line SO much. It must be being copy/pasted from some manifesto somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:01:07
Respect man. Nice work. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:42:42
Thanks man. I don't actually have any BTC on the exchange but curious to see what happens when all those BCH coins become available for trading.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:15:23
They used to though and hopefully they will again!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:32:16
Wasn’t he shilling bcash last week? He’s all over the map. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:19:20
I would be thrilled to send ya some bits for the Bs&amp;Gs!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:18:25
Have a beer man. Happy Thanksgiving!

Is there any way to see how many active nodes are running? Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:08:20
Great info man. Thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:00:26
When are they releasing those coins? I can't find any dates on it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:50:25
I kinda want the yellow one... 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:37:03
Excellent reminder. Yes. Sending a single 1BTC transaction and a .001BTC transaction should be the same transaction fee b/c it's the same amount of data.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:37:19
Exactly. Averages include people that have no idea how to set their own fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:52
I believe in hodling but I also believe in using it. If I owe a friend $20 for dinner or something I’ll offer to transfer them some bits rather than cash. Gets them in the system and learning and then I just replenish. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:44:52
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:23
Haha. I forgot about that image. Nice.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:01:47
I just tried it with incognito in chrome and firefox... 1: org 2: wiki 3: com... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:23:49
I actually opened the app and tried to run through the setup just to see. One of the biggest warning flags for me is that 
A) it lets you create a wallet without generating seed words. I wonder what happens to your funds if you can't recover them??
B) It asks for an email to generate a wallet which will go to who knows what uses. What does email have to do with wallet config? No other wallet I've ever used has asked for this.
So even WITHOUT the incredible confusion it creates between bcash and Bitcoin, it's a terrible wallet. 1 star. Deleting. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:17:59
I went once. Had to had a stiff drink after. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:39:37
I sent a $2 and probably could've gone lower. It's incredibly cheap compared to the average reported fee and also what others are SAYING the fee to send bitcoin is. Also, fees are at an all time high due to the weekend chaos and will almost certainly go down. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:24:24
I guess so. Gonna be tough for bcash to get there while bitcoin has already achieved its two segments. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:27:22
What do you mean "it wants"? What is it? The purpose of the post was to prove that you can set your own fees. I just proved that you can send .01BTC ($67ish) for $2. So I'm not sure what "it" you are using, but you need a new "it" I think...
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:12:28
We did it!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:42:00
Yea man. I've tried to get my account confirmed for weeks now. They are terrible. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:07:40
What’s the other good news?!! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:35:58
In Electrum you should be able to go into the options or preferences and set a manual fee. There's a way to override the slider. Definitely do not pay $34.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:13:35
Hiya, purpose of my post was to show that the average fees are not standard. I agree that $3 is high and we should work to lower them. I sent a $2 transaction and it went through. I expect that a $1 transaction would eventually go through. 
What's a fee that you think would be acceptable for the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:43:24
People like round numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:18:41
I'm doing some testing on fees actually and will post a full write up eventually. Shockingly, my 200sat/byte transaction is still unconfirmed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:12
Been stuck trying. To get verified for weeks. Luckily I had no coins on there but ya. Seems wonky. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:41:51
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:14:25
Sounds like you should probably short it then!
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:06:36
Ya. I had heard others had had issues so I thought I would try to get verified first. They caught and issue because I wrote Nick on my application but my ID said Nicholas. That was three weeks ago. Wouldn’t think it would be that hard to fix. 
In other news, hot confirmed by Poloniex the same day. Good to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:14:39
Time versus money is a forever tradeoff in many fields. Want it fast? Sent it with a higher fee. I wanted to trade some coins on Bittrex this weekend and sent them with about a $6 fee and they were there in no time. Not sure if they were in the very next block, but it was fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:31:40
How many nodes are running on the Bcash network currently? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:57:50
YES. I just sent one with 400 sat/byte and it confirmed in about 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:59:49
Does LTC have a cap on coins created?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:10:36
Ya man. I’ve been trying to keep an eye on bcash transactions. Seems like almost empty blocks are being mined. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:46:22
Weird man. I don’t have an answer. Maybe try a Segwit address? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:38:21
Definitely. I hope we get back to that baseline from Mid Oct. My goal with the post was to counteract the crazy talk going on in other posts and on other subs that you had to pay $20 to send bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:11:24
Roger that!
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:14:04
I think the absolute top is $76,854. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:04:32
Yea. If you buy lower than your average, it'll reduce your average cost. That's true whether or not you sell your current holdings though. 
But yes. In theory if you could guarantee a lower-than-average price at some point in the future, it would be mathmatically beneficial to sell at an above average price, take your profits, and then reinvest at the below average price. 
That's a lot of ifs though! Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:45:52
I sent a transaction today for $.40 that confirmed fast so I think any time when the network isn’t being spammed by frauds is fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:50:10
Interesting... I actually think I screwed this up. Thanks for the info! I could've sent for lower than $2 probably.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:27:15
This is very very hard to do. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:08:19
Weird man. Not sure... I sent mine from my trezor with adjusted custom fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:13:20
What was the manual fee you set? $1 should get you there with the current mempool I would think. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:02:33
In the Electrum options you can set a manual fee. You don’t need to pay that much. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:42:58
Please read better. The $4 transaction cleared immediately. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:10:19
I used bittrex to offload 8 over a few days. No issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:30:48
Absolutely! Just need mannnny more ETH... haha
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:25:27
It’ll be interesting to see what happens when coinbase releases all the bch they are holding for customers. Right now there is an artificial supply shortage. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:14
Does that mean he’s gonna fucking win?!
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:46:47
Who is paying $15? The whole point of my post is that you can send for $2. I probably could've went lower and this was during a period of highest average transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:35:31
Ummm. ETH has gone up like 40x this year. Not sure what you consider a rally...
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:11:08
I totally agree that $.01 fees would disrupt things, but I do think that decentralization is a big deal. It's a balancing act, but I like that bitcoin doesn't sacrifice everything to optimize for low transaction fees. I hope the fees continue to drop, and I think they will.
My point though was just that the discussions I've read (comparing to bcash or others) cite crazy high fees and I just wanted to bring everyone back down to earth a bit. 
I'm not saying a $2 fee is ideal or even low, but it's eight times lower than the average reported fee and in some cases 15 times lower than cited costs I've seen. 
So my point was to just ground the conversation a bit in reality. I actually think we agree. Ha!
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:51:18
Fair point. I don't think $2 is low. I think it's lower than what's being touted online. But yea... got a long way to go still.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:40:20
Zoom out. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:19:40
I stopped looking at it. It’s so dumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:37:06
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:25:42
I'm a big ETH fan. I was trying to show that the BTC chatter about transactions being $20-$30/trans were not true or necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:37:55
Really excellent article. I didn’t know some of this history. Thanks sir!
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:27:32
Not sure what you consider high... they are a bit higher than normal for sure. I just sent a .02btc transaction on a Segwit enabled address for less than $1 and it was confirmed in a few minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:19:46
I’ve never used the QT wallet. Sounds like a bad one. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:48:33
This is the best summary I’ve seen. Internet high five!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:42:55
Nah. I think you could sell it all in one swoop on CB and then it would just sit in your USD wallet on coinbase and you would have to slowly pull it out. Still very annoying though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:37:54
That is how math works!
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:04:29
Interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:45:47
Your plan would go wrong quickly if your sell order triggered at 3,000 but then BTC goes up and so your buy order never triggers... then you would be left with zero BTC and zero profits because you sold at basically your average cost/coin. 
In other words, trying to time a volatile market is pretty dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:14:59
Even in the comments of my post people thought it was costing up to $34 to transfer bitcoin. While you maybe think it has been discussed to death, there is still clearly a knowledge gap. I was trying to show, with some actual examples, that the high transaction fees being discussed related to bitcoin aren't necessary. 
Maybe you don't consider helping others figure out how to use a system better "healthy discussion," but I do. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:36:13
I really like the Trezor. I've used it for about a year and it's super easy to setup and use. It's MUCH more secure than a flash drive. 
My only two issues with it are:
A) It supports a very limited number of coins. If you are interested in buying other cryptos, might be worth getting an nano.
B) (more of an issue in my opinion) the firmware upgrades are really hard to do. You need to do firmware upgrades on the device to claim forked coins and stuff and it's a REAL pain to do. It involves some intricate timing of pressing both buttons at just the right time while plugging the device in. Last time I had to do it it took me literally two hours of trying before I got it to work. Annoying.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:09:58
Chill out man. We are on the same team. Everyone is not at the same knowledge level at the same time. Healthy discussion can happen on a subject that you may be well versed in. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:04:08
Nice summary man!
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:25:48

I sent a BTC transaction this week for cents. It arrived instantly, and was confirmed quickly. Agree scaling needs to be worked on though. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:39:00
Yep. I use it whenever it makes sense and just buy back the amount normally. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:48:37
I always keep a small amount on my phone to give out to people who are interested. It's an easy way to get them involved without showing them the ins and outs of exchanges, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:05:38
Beautiful. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:55:55
Actually for the first time, I went to bitcoin.com today... holy shit does that rabbit hole go deep. It's really sad to think that people are probably buying BCH that think they are buying Bitcoin. 
Thank the Internet gods that when you google Bitcoin the .ORG is the first result still. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:12:18
It probably won’t go below zero!

These are two dudes who are pretty versed in tech. Listening to them muddle through bitcoin re-convinced me that we are still very early in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Compared to people in his age demographic? I think he absolutely is. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:18:37
I didn't say blockchain tech. I said tech in general. He runs a popular website and hosts a range of successful podcasts and was in the podcast surge early. The fact that he clearly doesn't understand blockchain tech was my point. Adoption is still in the super early stages.

@_date: 2018-02-13 19:35:49
Just to try to keep the analogy the same, would you think it's crazy for someone making $200K a year to have a $400K mortgage?
That's not to say I think the deficit is not a problem. It definitely is. But, it's not a problem (IMO) because of the actual debt, it's because of WHY we are accumulating the debt. We aren't doing it to actually spur the economy in a time of downturn. We are doing it to add a tiny bit of extra profit to companies and rich people in a time of already excessive growth. 
So when we NEED to spend money on deficit during the next recession, there will be less available without triggering crazy side effects. 
So the debt isn't a problem in and of itself, but the REASON behind the debt is a signal of future pain. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:35:31
It's cool man! I saw that and passed on it!
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:42:27
Okay, but to answer your question: 1) Nothing. 2) proof of work.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:23:41
We are much more reliant on electricity than we were thousands of years ago because, ya know... it didn't exist.
As an example, look up Memorial Medical Center during Hurricane Katrina. Not exactly 24 hours, but a few days with no power and they were beyond any procedures and basically having to choose who lives and who dies. Imagine that across the entire globe? 
Maybe it would take a few days to fully devolve, but not long. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:03:25

Ha. Nope. After talking to a few pros I decided against it. If you actually try to fill out the like kind form it’s very obvious that it’s not intended for something like this. I’m declaring my trades and paying the taxes. 
Ultimately it’s not a huge deal bc it ups your basis on those investments so less taxes in the future.

Could someone from 1018 bring anything useful to present time? I think the answer is no. Everything they would think to bring would be completely useless and they would probably be in a mental institution within 5 minutes of the transport. I assume the same would be true for me!

@_date: 2018-03-05 23:34:53
Haha. Fair point. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:05:12
Yep. Ultimately, you should get a good accountant who understands (or is willing to learn about) crypto. Here's the advice mine gave me in a nutshell though:
- If you exchange any crypto back to USD, you must pay taxes on gains (either capital gains or otherwise). It doesn't matter where the USD resides. If you exchange it, you pay taxes.
- The gray area is if you exchange crypto-crypto. If you buy NEO, for example, with BTC, you probably don't have to pay taxes on transfer b/c it's seen as a like-property exchange. But, your basis on the NEO is the original basis you had for the BTC, if that makes sense. 
- If you went from BTC-USD and then USD-ETH (for example), you would have to pay taxes on that but the basis for the ETH investment would be the full amount at the time of purchase.
I'm not a tax professional, but this is how I'm handling it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:51:32
Wow. both these guys make my head spin and are perfect examples that if you are willing to say anything, you can make a shit ton of money.
