What you're talking about is the so-called 'supernodes' solution, where you essentially have a multi-tiered system. This has been proposed before but has many drawbacks, most specifically that you need access to a server farm to play Bitcoin. You would essentially be re-building the global banking system.


Not really, because a large part of that ~8 seconds is latency accumulated over multiple retransmissions, bandwidth will not do anything to change that. Moreover, Bitcoin nodes avoid setting up links to multiple peer nodes with similar IP addresses to avoid being caught in an isolation attack. This has the side-effect of building an overlay topology heavily out of sync with the actual internet infrastructure - you'll see messages fly around from the US to Japan, to Africa, China, Russia, etc. rather than take a logical shortest path. All this heavily adds to the total latency. 
Moreover, internet speeds would need to go up faster than Bitcoin adoption, or conversely, Bitcoin adoption would be constrained how much faster internet we can get. Hardly a happy prospect.

This is why I mentioned [churn]( If you have to move gigabytes of data around every time a node goes down, then lots of churn means lots and lots of traffic. 
The problem here is that storage of data is inherently static: most data stored by Dropbox users doesn't change much over time, and read/write is relatively low compared to the stored amount. All storage systems (databases, cloud storage, AWS, etc.) are highly optimized for this using multiple levels of caching and so on.
So now you're going to do this in a P2P fashion, which means extreme volatility both in terms of churn and network topology. This means that you're constantly moving data around lest you lose it. 
To be able to guarantee a modicum of availability and integrity in such a network the only real option is to increase replication, but that in turn has an amplifying effect on the amount of data being thrown around, and obviously reduces the overall free space in the network.


Even if you would get 1x replication 'for free' as it where, you would still need several back-up nodes. It doesn't really do much to reduce the problem. It's like the difference between being shot 2 times instead of 3 times.

Bruteforcing SHA256 is so unlikely, it can safely be regarded as impossible, at least for the forseeable future.


Didn't ghash have &gt;51% at one or two points in time? Alternatively, an attacker could start a few seemingly unrelated mining pools and grow them until they have 51% between them. 


I thought it was a clever idea when I first read about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:49:26


Yes, and then you need to do this many times to saturate the network. You need to take topology and diameter into account. Last I heard even a small message takes ~8 seconds to propagate. Feel free to read [this thread]( from last November. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:46:27
I did consider it and I agree. I am just saying that getting there may be a very, very rocky road. 
Right now a miner makes 25btc on a block, a predictable number considering the relative price stability within a 10-minute time frame. In the future, the total reward will depend on how the number of available transactions develops (adoption), how much people are willing to pay in terms of fees (a big open question, imho) and the bitcoin price at that time (could go up, could crash). So I have no way to predict how much money a miner will be making on a block, and whether it will be enough to pay his electricity bill. 
There might very well be a period where prices crash for a long time, mining will actually cost much more money than it delivers, the network will not be quick enough to respond to the change in hashing power from miners leaving, and grind to a halt due to a too high difficulty. Up until now hashing power has only gone up, we have no way of knowing what will happen if it suddenly goes down.
We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.

Well, I see how providing a monetary incentive to increase node stability is a good idea. However, you will never get close to anywhere near the availability of a node in a warehouse, so how can you still guarantee data integrity with 3x redundancy? 
Have you done any kind of analysis? How did you arrive at the 3x number, and what kind of availability/integrity guarantees will you be giving to end users? Do you expect to do worse, better, or equal to Dropbox in this respect?

I've been reading this subreddit on-and-off for about two years now as somewhat of an observer, fascinated more by the community that the technology itself. It seems to me that the vibrant optimism I used to see around here has turned into vicious pessimism now that the price has been dropping for months, and Bitcoin appears to be slipping ever further into irrelevance.
Realistically, I highly doubt Bitcoin is even on the radar of the Government and/or big banks, let alone that they would hire people to go on reddit and discredit it. 
It seems to me that the concept of paid shills is just a way for people on this subreddit to delude themselves into thinking that Bitcoin, and perhaps they themselves, are relevant. It is cognitive dissonance at its finest. People are trying to deal with the fact that Bitcoin is not going to the moon, and they are looking for a scapegoat.
Maybe instead of lashing out at those who are critical of Bitcoin, perhaps people should examine their own actions, and wonder if their expectations of Bitcoin were realistic to begin with.

Respectfully, 'unlimited' is not a number, so 'almost unlimited' has no meaning, any real number is equally far from unlimited for practical purposes. 1MB/s is just as 'unlimited' as 10MB/s, 100MB/s, etc.
Moreover, network performance is bound by physics. For example, you can't bring latency down much further from current values because then you'd be transmitting faster than the speed of light. Bandwidth, too, has physical limitations set by the medium you're transmitting in (e.g. fiber or wireless).
Perhaps you meant to say you have an unlimited download cap?

I think you hit the nail on the head here. Bitcoin's 'solution' comes with so many drawbacks that it cannot be rightly called a solution. Can you call a system successful if it struggles with transaction rates of tens of TPS?
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:55:56
I never understood why Satoshi designed block rewards like this. He could have easily made the block reward a smooth function of the block number, rather than just halving it every so many blocks. I dunno, maybe I'm missing something.
As for what will happen, I have no idea. The way the difficulty self-adjusts is designed to deal with a _gradual increase_ in hash power as a result of Moore's law. It would respond very badly to a _sudden decrease_ in hash power, as you pointed out, because blocks would take much longer to mine, and it takes a certain number of blocks before the difficulty is adjusted. If a sudden, significant drop in hash power does happen, we would see a prolonged period of slow transaction confirmations. 
How the miners, the market, and the Bitcoin developers/overlords will deal with this situation is anyone's guess.

None of these are bottlenecks. Miners don't want to create large blocks because the increased propagation time increases the chance of a found block to be orphaned. 


Those water-cooled asics don't pay for themselves.


Miners mine because they want to earn block rewards, collecting fees is secondary, and are really only used to keep people from spamming 'dust' transactions.

With all due respect, your experience is hardly relevant to whether or not Bitcoin can scale. Scalability _is_ an academic endavour, grounded solidly in math, graph theory, and empirical analysis. I am afraid you do not hold the qualifications to make an expert judgement here. This is not me snubbing you as a laymen, it is simply fact. Just as I am not qualified to run an oil platform or perform brain surgery. 


Cool. 


Who was saying that, academia? I highly doubt it, since it was academics who invented the bulk of the technology that you describe.
Moreover, internet latency is now down very close to the speed of light, and we simply cannot get lower than that (save quantum entanglement). So even though we can get more bandwidth by putting more cables into the ground, we're already leveling out on that one. 


Well, people also demand flying cars and hover boards, that doesn't make them technically feasible. Market demand cannot change the laws of physics.


The current devs are the kings of Bitcoin. They control the protocol. I am not sure how you would propose dethroning them, short of forking the blockchain, which would ruin Bitcoin.


Then you should remember all the technology that promised the world and never delivered. 
Truth be told, Bitcoin is an experiment. I don't know which way it will go, but blindly believing it will succeed seems a bit dangerous to me.

Absolutely, I think an economical incentive is a really good way to motivate miners to take the risk. Another is to lower said risk by reducing propagation latency, but alas, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Unfortunately standard tx fees have dropped recently, and anyway, if tx fees get too high Bitcoin loses one of its major advantages over fiat. 
So if the block reward halves, what is going to happen? Will we increase tx fees to cover the difference, or will miners just lose money? And if mining is no longer profitable, will miners start to leave? What happens to transaction times then, will we start seeing blocks once per half hour, once per hour even? 
And how will we transition to a situation where tx fees pays for all the electricity while still turning a profit?
It's a bit of a thorny problem, I have no idea how all this will develop. But I guess that's why I keep following Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:16:22


Why are you saying we are 'extremely far' from the limits? The problem is that miners are purposefully creating smaller blocks (i.e. &lt;1MB). This is because mining is a race; the first to have his new block accepted by the majority of the network wins the block reward. Large blocks take longer to propagate, decreasing your chances of winning.

This is not really related to whether Bitcoin will scale or not, so I'm not really interested in debating it, sorry.


CPUs an RAM haven't gotten faster for years, which is why we're currently going parallel all over the place. Internet has found its bottom in terms of latency. There are many technologies that are hardly getting better. Battery capacity comes to mind. Fuel efficiency is another one. Solar panel efficiency. 
And even if network bandwidth, disk space, and RAM size keeps evolving, the point you are missing is that Bitcoin transaction throughput has to _outpace adoption_ for it not to become a bottleneck. If we have Moore's law to depend on, I don't see Bitcoin going to the moon any time soon.


Again, not relevant to the discussion. If you are offended, I apologize.

Respectfully, moving a million dollars using the traditional banking system does not cost the same as moving a thousand dollars times a thousand. At my European bank, transferring money into the US costs me 15 euro plus 0.1% of the amount, _with a maximum of 75 euro_. And this is a regular checkings account, mind you.
I know US banks charge more for the service, but I'm pretty sure that when you move around millions of USD on a regular basis, you're not paying 1-2% every time.
Bitcoin on the other hand has a conversion fee of ~1% if you're looking to spend your money in any meaningful way. So, for large amounts, it's actually much more expensive.  I don't understand why people keep hammering on this perceived advantage?

Im am not 'against Bitcoin', and I don't think it's constructive or even relevant to think in such terms. The social and economical aspects simply do not interest me all that much. I am not a cryptoanarchist, and I'm not particularly thrilled about buying tacos with Bitcoin instead of my debit card. I do not own, or have ever owned, any Bitcoin, so I have no interest in talking my book. I do find Bitcoin extremely interesting as a phenomenon however, and I enjoy seeing the story unfold.
That being said, I have a background in computer science in general, and distributed systems in particular. I have read the whitepaper, and I read bitcointalk on occasion which has helped me fill in some of the details Satoshi glossed over in his work. As a scientist, I am mainly skeptical about the p2p network part of Bitcoin. I worry about its scalability and adaptibility to rapid changes in hash rate (i.e. miners leaving en masse). 
So if being skeptical qualifies as 'against Bitcoin', feel free to consider me found.

So from an algorithmic perspective this is not a solution because it does not do anything to improve the Bitcoin protocol. On the other hand, from the perspective of an end user, it might be considered a solution, although now you have trusted parties in the mix, which was the whole point Bitcoin was trying to eliminate in the first place.

Dropbox costs $99/year for 100GB. You're not paying for disk space, you're paying for the guarantee of near 100% data integrity and 99.99% availability. 
Good luck matching that with 3x redundancy in a high-churn p2p environment where nodes go down at a much higher rate, have much lower up-times, and when they go down, you never know if they will ever come back up again (e.g. the user may have gone to bed, or maybe just reformatted his machine). Data stored by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc. has 3x redundancy _in their warehouses_.

While this is cool, I doubt it will be the reason Bitcoin is going to 'undoubtedly succeed'. First of all, the vast majority of people in this world don't need to wire large sums of money across international borders. 
Second, you implicitly converted the amount and transaction fee from Bitcoin to USD, while in the real world, this would cost you around %1, or around $570, to do. If all your financial dealings are in Bitcoin, you are right, but most people still need to pay their rent, utilities, etc. in fiat.
Third, and I think this is most important, if Bitcoin's low transaction fees would ever become a real threat to the banking sector, banks would simply lower their fees to match, and find other ways to make money off of you. 
People like to compare Bitcoin to the internet, but to me it's more like Linux. There exists an established solution (i.e. fiat/Windows) that everybody uses and although it has warts, is generally happy with. However, if you care about certain ethical principles and want a community-driven alternative, Bitcoin/Linux gives you that option.
Of course, there are always going to be people who think Bitcoin will dominate the world economy, just as the Linux enthusiasts in the early 2k's thought Linux would conquer the desktop. It should be clear that didn't happen, and it's easy to see why. For the average user, Linux didn't offer anything Windows didn't already have, so why switch?
Having lived through 'the Linux desktop' years, when every bright teenager and twenty-something was developing instant messaging clients and audio players for Linux, I see a huge amount of similarity with the Bitcoin community. When Dell was going to ship Linux laptops, it was 'going to be huge for Linux!'. Every piece of news was good news, and every piece of good news was a 'game changer'. 
Imho, Bitcoin will never be huge, Linux will never conquer the desktop, and I'm perfectly fine with that. Just because only 1% of the world uses it, doesn't mean Linux has failed. I run it every day and I'm incredibly happy with it. The same should go for Bitcoin.

Increased compared to what? 
Basically blocks are broadcasted globally in a multi-hop fashion. Blocks are downloaded completely, verified, and then uploaded to one-hop neighbours.
You 'win' a block when your solution reaches &gt;50% of the network before anyone else's. The time it takes to reach half the network depends on how many network nodes there are, network topology, average node degree, etc. 


If latency goes down, miners might include more transactions in their blocks, and people would possibly be able to get away with paying smaller fees.  However, if Bitcoin adoption outpaces network bandwidth, the situation will obviously persist.
I think they are working on a method to speed up block propagation, but afaik there's only one guy working on the code at the moment, and nobody wants to change anything for fear of breaking Bitcoin. Besides, this particular solution would allow for a one-time increase in TPS, so we would get stuck again at a slightly higher rate.

@_date: 2014-08-01 06:13:56






Respectfully, you don't seem to understand the fundamental principles underlying computer networks in general, and Bitcoin in particular.   
Those banking systems, clunky mountains of Java code as they may be, are still able to achieve TPS rates orders of magnitude higher compared to Bitcoin. That's because _highly centralized payment processing is always going to be faster than massively decentralized_. 
At its historical peak last December, Bitcoin was doing 100,000 transactions per day, or 1.16 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison, VISA is doing _2000_. So your statement is demonstrably false. 
And even at current TPS rates, Bitcoin is buckling under the strain. You now have to pay TX fees to get your transaction confimed within the next block, because miners refuse to make large blocks. 
Large blocks mean long propagation times, and an increased probability that blocks will be orphaned. So miners are creating smaller blocks. This is a fundamental bottleneck that will not just go away. Why do you think people are talking about extending the protocol for speeding up block propagation? I estimate we can raise Bitcoin TPS maybe 10-fold by distributing new blocks more efficiently, but then we're going to hit another wall. 
Bitcoin needs to scale up 1000x to catch up to VISA, which is simply not going to happen. And even if we were somehow able to bridge the gap, you are discounting the fact that if banks are really threatened, they have much more room for optimization compared to Bitcoin. 
I work for a large international company known for its cloud services. Let me ask you, how many requests do you think gmail gets? Or ebay? Or google search for that matter? When it comes to performance, no massively, globally distributed system running on consumer-grade hardware and networks will ever be able to compete with warehouse computing.
And that's just TPS. With VISA, I don't need to wait ~ten minutes waiting at the take-away counter while my food goes cold.

I don't have to prove Bitcoin will fail to be skeptical, just like you don't have to prove to me it will succeed to believe in it. What we can do is discuss the reasoning behind our opinions.
Given my knowledge about how Bitcoin works, I see a few pretty big problems on the horizon, and no path to overcome them.

The only difference is how Bitcoin defines majority: not in terms of number of IP's, but in terms of proof of work. The idea being that it's more difficult for an attacker to gain computational majority versus node majority.
This is not a solution however, as it does not make an attack impossible, just more difficult to execute.
@_date: 2014-07-10 14:03:03


This is an oft-repeated logical fallacy. Bitcoin is not the Internet. The Internet was a technology that had a very clear advantage over the technology it was replacing (phone, mail, the library, etc.), and opened up a whole host of new possibilities (search engines, digital pornography, online shopping, social media, zero-cost publishing, blogging, etc. etc.). Bitcoin has neither quality: it offers very little over current digital payment options unless you hate/distrust your banks/government, or don't want to pay taxes. 


Does the author have information or some sort of proof I am not aware of? Security of the Bitcoin network is an ongoing investigation with new kinds of attacks being discovered all the time. Sure, the crypto is pretty solid, but there are plenty of other potential weaknesses in the P2P network, probabilistic attacks (e.g. selfish mining, attacks against gambling bots, etc. GHash.IO has had &gt;51% at times, which is a lot more worrying than the probability of someone breaking SHA256. 


Or you buy out the GHash.IO guys. Or you start a few seemingly unrelated pools with zero fees and wait until they have 51% between them. 
Bitcoin is an experimental technology, and people should treat it as such.


Completely unfounded projection. Citation needed on the so-called 'explosive growth of Bitcoin'. 


Unless you are one of the $1000+ bagholders. 


Yet the author goes on to not provide a single compelling reason people should make the switch. Or is the author seriously suggesting that, from the perspective of the average Joe/Jane, Bitcoin's extreme volatility is an _improvement_ over a relatively predictable 2-4% inflation per year?

That said, another issue I think might become a problem is the dual/triple points of failure represented by the pools. Take over one or two of those and ddos another one or two and you have majority.

Feel free to read my past comments on scalability [here]( and my reservations regarding major adoption [here](
As for miners leaving, I worry that a major loss of hashing power in a short amount of time could slow the network down to a crawl. Because difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, once the network becomes very slow (e.g. one block every hour instead of once per ten minutes), it will also take many weeks to revert to normal operation.

Which is it?
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:47:57


In 10 years internet latency is not going to be better. We can't "Moore's law" our way out of everything, unfortunately.


Peer-to-peer systems have historically been successful because they _distribute_ work across a large group of nodes, and help nodes discover other nodes that have an interest in talking to each other. This has been the fundamental principle which lets them scale to a high number of nodes.
Bitcoin on the other hand is a _replicated_ system, which offers no such "divide and conquer" option, as every node is expected to replicate and check the work of the entire network. Theoretically, such a system is unscalable by design.
Personally I don't see how this can be helped. We can innovate and move the barrier forward a little to maybe hundreds of TPS (e.g. the whole 'invertible bloom filters' idea) but somewhere along the line latency and network diameter will kill you unless you are willing to become increasingly centralized.

Usually they give you a grace period to get your data out. 


Of course, because the new owner wants to completely alienate all their customers and destroy their investment


Then don't put your data in a place that's specifically designed for sharing pirated and otherwise shady material.


I don't live in the US. Also, has such a thing ever happened before, or are you just pulling random shit out of your ass right now?


True. 


Most data centers are away from large cities because of land prices, proximity to cheap electricity, etc. 


I would calculate the probability of my Dropbox being wiped out by natural disaster, war, aliens, etc. to be a few orders of magnitude less than my data being lost simply because 3x redundancy in a P2P is a stupid idea.
The mistake you're making is that you're thinking in average. You are right, _most_ of the data will be available _most of the time_ for _most users_. However, the risk to an individual user, losing a specific piece of data, is very, very high. 
Planes fall out of the sky all the time because three things with very low failure rates actually happened to fail at the same time. 


Huh? Better in what way? Data centers already use erasure coding since forever, and their networks are faster and more stable than any P2P system.

Actually this is incorrect. The block size limit is currently 1MB, but the last time I checked there were exactly zero blocks created that hit this limit. 
In the current system the bottleneck is the block propagation time, which  depends on block size. Since larger blocks take longer to propagate, the probability of that block being orphaned increases with size. 
Because of this it makes economic sense for miners to mine smaller blocks, i.e. &lt;1MB, because it decreases the risk of the block being orphaned, in which case they lose their revenue.
So at the moment the Bitcoin network is actually hitting a very real network bottleneck, that is going to be difficult to solve. One option is to force a minimum block size on miners, but this is not technologically feasible for many reasons (for one, if TPS drops below a certain point, the network would halt). Another is to increase fees to the point where revenue from larger blocks outweighs the risk of that block being orphaned (economical incentive). 
To me the best approach on the short term is to make block propagation faster, for example by not broadcasting the entire block, but only the transaction headers, which should reduce the block size to less than one tenth, and allow TPS to rise about 10x, roughly catching up to the average TPS of PayPal (not peak, of course). 
Implementing this would require updates to the protocol, new messages, and the majority of pools would have to switch (which at the moment requires only convincing two pool operators, luckily). This will all take time and as far as I can see people are still debating the issue.
For a better understanding of the problem I suggest you read [this thread](
tl:dr; we are not hitting the 1MB limit atm, so raising max block size will not fix anything.

Playing devil's advocate here


Might be good for merchants, but how about consumers? This offers very little protection against being ripped off over the internet.


Good selling point, but you have to be honest about informing people that their purchases are not insured, or protected against skimming/fraud as they are when they use credit cards. 


One can do that with paypal, credit card, bank transfers.


Paypal?  


Customers hardly ever have to eat a loss when their card information gets stolen, this is generally covered by the bank?


Again, I would say this is the most convincing argument. However, if you want to send fiat to another country, e.g. USD-&gt;BTC-&gt;EUR, you have to take the exchange fees/comissions into account, which is around 1% (I don't actually use btc, so I might be off).


Again, you can pay people with any kind of currency you like.


You might be surprised by how little the general public worries about such things. You can call them sheeple all day long, but that will not make them change their minds. I very much doubt this argument will convert many people. 


So far the message seems to be that I can shave ~2% off of my PayPal/credit card transaction fees, but then I have to worry about cold-storage, multiple wallets, and safe surfing, I am not insured, and there are no chargebacks. I hate to say it, but that doesn't sound like a very convincing sell to me.

This is a terrible idea, because it forces everybody to solo. A guy with a few ASICs in his bedroom would have almost zero chance to win a block, taking away the steady stream of income that pools provide.

If Bitcoin were truly secure, why would it need a human 'last line of defense'? 
I don't mean to sound pedantic or contrarian, but what I'm trying to say is that from an academic perspective, Bitcoin does not truly _solve_ the problem is set out to. It simply makes it harder for an attacker to execute an attack. Moreover, the proposed solution (the blockchain in combination with proof of work) opens up a whole new range of attacks that other systems are not subject to, such as selfish mining and other probabilistic attacks.

@_date: 2014-03-29 16:18:13
I am a CS PhD candidate, about to finish, and from personal experience I can tell you that most scientists in the distributed computing communities I talk to are extremely sceptical of Bitcoin's technology. Specificially the inability of it to scale beyond relatively low tps rates without hitting network bandwidth/latency barriers. This is not about security or crypto, but simply the fundamental limitations of computer networks.
Basically, any system that attempts to replicate across hundreds of thousands of internet nodes is bound to hit scalability problems. Systems are traditionally distributed for reasons of scalability (distribute the work) or robustness. Bitcoin does not distribute the work, but rather replicates it, and this replication causes superlinear overhead. In other words, if you have twice as many transactions, you need more than twice the amount of messages/bandwidth/latency etc. 
So far, adoption has not reached the point where Bitcoin needs to support &gt;1 tps on average, so things are generally fine if you don't mind paying tx fees to get your transaction through in a timely manner. However, in order to get to 10 tps or so, major work is needed on the protocol (broadcast transaction hashes only). 
Given the reluctancy of devs to make even minor adjustments in fear of breaking things I don't think we'll see this implemented any time soon. This adjustment might open up additional spam attack vectors, for example, that need to be thouroughly analyzed and tested. Moreover, even if this work on the protocol is done, it would simply delay the problem.. 
Now of course you can go ahead and claim that 'technology will improve', invoke moore's law, link to the wiki page on scalability, or use any kind of wishful thinking to support the idea that Bitcoin is infallible, but if the leaders in the scientific field are not buying it, you know something is not right.
tl:dr; just because bitcoin has been working well so far, doesn't mean it won't keel over with widespead adoption.

Miners maximize profit, not minimize latency. Large blocks mean longer latency, and therefore a higher probability of losing a block reward. So, larger blocks lose money over the long run.
On the other hand, adding more transactions of course means more TX fees. The equilibrium between those competing constraints represents the optimal block size for a miner.
When latency goes down, miners are incentivised create larger blocks.

The 40% is computed relative to normal operation of the network, where the difficulty matches the actual hash rate, and blocks are found at 10 minute intervals. 
Right after the drop the hashing power is 10% of where it needs to be. When the network tries to recalculate the difficulty, it will need to scale by 0.1 to regain normalcy after the first drop. However, since it cannot scale down below 0.25, the difficulty after the first recalc will be 25% of the original value. To recompute the hashing power relative to this new difficulty, 0.1/0.25=0.4=40%.
Or to compute it differently, when you drop the difficulty 4x (divide by four), the network will find blocks four times as fast. So instead of taking 100 minutes for a block, it will take 100/4=25 minutes to find a block. This is still 2.5 times as long as the intended 10 minutes, so the network speed is 40% of normalcy (10/25=0.4).
Come to think of it, the problem is actually going to be worse because afaik the network computes the hash rate as an average over the last 2016 blocks. So, again assuming a 90% drop mid-adjustments, the network will compute the average hashing power of the network as an average of 10% and 100%, which is 55%. It will then scale the hash rate to 55% of where it needs to be.
So, the first recalc will actually scale the difficulty down by a factor of 0.55. The hash rate would then be 18.18% of normality, and it would stay that way for 77 days.

Respectfully, it's a bit more subtle than that. The network will continue to operate, but service will be impaired for a longer time than many people think. 
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. When hash rate is lost, blocks take longer to find, and the network takes longer to adjust.
For example, imagine the hashing power suddenly drops to 10% half-way between adjustments. This means the time until the next adjustment would be 2016/2=1008 blocks, which would normally take roughly a week to find. However, because we are hashing at 10% of the power, it now takes ten weeks before the next adjustment is made. During that time, blocks take 100 minutes to be found, on average.
However, according to [this]( the difficulty is never adjusted by more than a factor of four. That means that after the first difficulty adjustment is made, the hashing power increases to 40% of what it was before the drop. After another 2016 blocks the rate will be adjusted again, which will take 14*2.5=35 days, or about a month. Blocks will take 25 minutes on average to be found during this time.
So the total time the network will be impaired in this scenario is 70+35=105 days, or roughly three-and-a-half months. 
It should also be noted that if Bitcoin grinds to a halt, the miners may have to manually adjust the rate at some predetermined block number, e.g. by hard coding this into the software and switching over as many miners as possible to the new version. Of course this is extremely dangerous because you will fork all the nodes that do not upgrade.
In the end it all depends on how quickly the hash rate will drop, at what time between adjustments the drop happens, and how far it will drop compared to the last adjustment. We will have to wait and see, but I wouldn't just blindly assume everything is going to be fine. Interesting times ahead for the Bitcoin experiment for sure.
edit: another thing to take into account here is that if the hash rate drops, max TPS drops as well. Given a maximum block size of 1 megabyte and an average transaction size of 300 bytes, you are able to fit 3500 transactions in a block. If the hash rate drops to 10%, your max TPS will drop to around 0.58, so significantly less than one transaction per second.

This was suggested in the thread, but as you pointed out yourself, miners could 'pad' the block with transactions to themselves. Moreover, this change would fundamentally alter which blocks are accepted by the system, and you need to get all the miners/pools on board unless you want to fork the blockchain. I wouldn't call this 'trivial'.

I've lived through the P2P hype in the early 2000's when everybody was scrambling to _decentralize all the things_. A lot of the algorithms and technology that came out of that eventually made it into cloud computing. 
The only difference is that instead of using customer-grade machines located all around the world and connected through slow internet connections, you put all the machines in one place so you can have low latency, huge amounts of bandwidth, and cheap electricity. 
Datacenters also have less _churn_. Churn is the rate at which nodes (machines) leave the network. In a datacenter, nodes leave when there is a hardware fault. In a P2P network like storj, people who rent out their hardware can simply decide to stop cooperating. Or maybe their power goes out, or they reboot, or they just don't want to leave their machine running all the time. At any rate, churn in a P2P network is orders of magnitude higher than in a datacenter. This means storj must distribute their data to a larger number of machines to ensure the same number of 'nines' (e.g. 99.999% availability).
So what storj is doing is exactly the same as what S3 and Dropbox do, but only with more expensive hardware, on a really shitty network (the internet), and with huge amounts of churn. I honestly don't understand why anyone would think that is a good idea.

Excellent question. 
Javascript has no constructs for dealing with concurrency, such as locks or thread-safe collections. As a result, you can really only use it for event-driven programming. This is fine for scripting a browser UI, but sometimes you just want to fill up all the eight cores of your machine with work without having to sandbox them in processes like some animal.
Javascript uses dynamic/weak typing, which means the compiler has no information about types. This makes refactoring a _lot_ more difficult compared to Java or C where you can easily rename methods, encapsulate fields, move classes around or split them up, etc. etc. because the AST has type annotations. Sure Javascript allows you to develop fast in the beginning, but as soon as you reach the maintenance phase of your project, lack of refactoring tools really starts to hurt your productivity. This is one of the reasons people are so excited about TypeScript.
The Javascript Number type does not support integers. The kind of bit twiddling required for crypto is therefore difficult to implement. This also goes for the Bitcoin wire format. If you're doing a project where you really need to be compatible with all the corner cases and bugs in a C++ program, not having integer types kinda sucks.
Javascript lacks the kind of features you need to write large-scale applications. It has no modules or namespaces, and lacks class-based OO (although some may say prototyping is superior). This makes it somewhat hard to manage a large collection of logically separable chunks of code. 
Javascript lacks a good class library. C++ has boost/stl, The JVM and .NET come with their own standardized set of collections, utilities, date classes, stream classes, I/O methods etc. etc. While all of this has been developed in the Javascript ecosystem, none of these are really standardized. This means that you have to piece together functionality from a set of libraries that never quite work well together because they themselves depend on a whole host of other things and may not even be using the same style of class-based OO, use the same naming conventions, etc.
Finally, Javascript is slow as tits. Sure, V8 started a revolution in Javascript performance, but the JVM still runs circles around it. This is made worse by the way people program in Javascript, for example by having functions take many different types of parameters (e.g. a function can take either a number, string, or object, and still work) which means that V8 cannot do certain optimizations related to type inference (e.g. hidden classes). Whether you care about performance depends on your application, but since Bitcoin does a lot of CPU intensive stuff I'd say it's pretty relevant here. 
Sure you can write anything you want in Javascript. You can write it in Python too, or Ruby. Or Java or Scala. Or C or TypeScript or Go. Or Haskell, or Clojure or F Each of these has pros and cons and most developers I know just pick whatever tool is best for the job. My professional experience tells me that in this particular case, it's not Javascript.

I'm more interested in the block propagation time, which I think is a much more interesting metric.
Global broadcast is a bitch and scales linearly with the network diameter. I assume block broadcast is a store-forward operation (node needs to verify a block before it can forward), so it would have to scale linearly with block size as well. So, by that logic, 20mb blocks would take twenty times as long to propagate as 1mb blocks. The real question is whether miners will want to take the risk.
You can probably mine a lot of information about network statistics from the blockchain already and from there establish a relationship between block size and propagation time. Then at least you have a hypothesis you can verify with experiments.

100 billion transactions per year equals 3168.88 TPS. Assuming an average transaction size of 300 bytes, that means blocks will have to be 5.3122 GB in size. _Peak_ rates would be a lot higher (those 100 billion transactions are not evenly distributed in time), so let's say we'll need 10GB blocks (probably higher, but let's be conservative). 
In any event, going from the average of 5.3122GB/block, the blockchain would grow by 765GB per day, 23.16TB/month, and 272.67TB every year. 
A 4TB disk is about $150 on NewEgg. Going by this price, the cost of storing the block chain would be $868/month for just the disks. Of course, you'll need to put all these disks in a special cabinet, power them, put them in a network, etc., which will add to the costs.
Another issue is that when blocks reach 10GB in size, block propagation will start to hurt as well. Even at current tiny block sizes we are already seeing 1-2% orphan rates. Transmitting the TX hashes only will help somewhat, but even 1% of 10GB is still 100MB. which is a 100x our current cap. 'Invertible bloom filters' will not help you here, you can't compress data down to zero. 
For comparison Bitcoin is currently capped at 1MB blocks, which works out to a TPS rate of &lt;6.

If you take an arbitrary time frame, you can use the price chart to tell just about any story you want. Just ignore the part where it has lost 70% of its value and has been trending steadily down for almost a year now. Also price doesn't matter, even though I've just used it as an argument to support my claim that Bitcoin is exploding.


If you look only at the good news, and ignore all the bad, you can see growth everywhere. Just ignore the collapsing price, imploding cloud mining business, bankrupt hardware manufacturers, scams, hacks, etc. Focus on the fundamentals, even though nobody actually knows what they are. There is only good news, bad news makes us angry and posting it here always equates to trolling/shilling. No exceptions.

Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. If the hashing power goes down to 1/100, you would be mining blocks at 1/100 the speed, so blocks would be found once every 1000 minutes, or 16.66.. hours. So average case we need to wait 2016/2=1008 blocks, each taking 16.66.. hours, equals 700 days, which is almost two years.
Of course, if that would happen, I'm sure the devs would step in and force a lowering of the difficulty by releasing a new version or some such intervention.

If you are running a public service, having the ability to scale up your service quickly and safely in the face of increased demand, is an absolute must. Where I work, no service would be allowed to launch without that ability.
So imho, the fact that you even face that dilemma means that you designed your service wrong. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:22:19
In my daily job I maintain a cloud hosted front-end service. We deal with attacks and outages in a number of ways.
We have several canaries running to monitor the health of our service, and we have automated alarms that fire when certain metrics go out of whack (e.g. latency, error rate). We log loads and loads of data on our servers including a whole share of different counters and timers to help us debug issues should they arrive. We automatically collect these logs from all the boxes in our fleet at a single place where we can access them quickly. We have a graphing tool that we can use to plot any kind of numerical data in our logs, and we use these plots to understand and communicate about outages. 
We always have someone from our team on call, and carry around pagers that wake us up in case of an alarm. We have secondaries to respond if the primary doesn't wake up, and escalation rules all the way up the management chain. For large-impact outages we have management on-calls that we can page in to manage communication to our customers. We monitor our dependencies, and we can page in other teams and have them in a conference call within five-ten minutes. In fact, we have a group of people whose sole responsibility it is to facilitate these kinds of conference calls between teams.
When the problem is caused by a code update we can automatically roll back our code to previous versions. If we can't resolve an emergency by rolling back, we have a system in place to quickly deploy code hot-fixes to our fleet. 
For fixing capacity-related issues, we have automatic throttling on all our API calls, and the ability to change throttling rules on the fly and have them on all our boxes within five minutes. If we feel the traffic we're getting is legitimate and want to increase capacity, we can add more machines to our fleet just by changing a setting. 
Now compare all this with Bitcoin. First of all, I doubt anybody is on call for Bitcoin, or even has automated alarms set up that warn them if certain metrics go out of whack (maybe core devs can correct me on this). All diagnostic information appears to come directly from the block chain, as miners are not exactly pushing their logs to a central place where core devs can look at them.
Second, when the problem is detected, and communication needs to happen to resolve the problem, I doubt a core dev can just spin up a call with all the major miners to get the issue resolved. I know that this does happen in practice, but I imagine it's all a bit more ad-hoc, and certainly doesn't happen within minutes.
Finally, when it comes to mitigation, any change to Bitcoin core has to be deployed to 50% of the network, which again requires cooperation for said miners. Crucial operations like rolling back and hotfixing are super hard because everybody needs to be on board. Besides, if I'm not mistaken, most miners actually run their own modified versions anyway, so any changes there are extremely hard to influence.
I guess my point with all this is that there's not just a technical challenge here. If Bitcoin wants to run as a reliable service, it needs to solve the _operational challenges_ and make sure core devs can detect, analyze, and resolve outages as quickly as possible.
edit: If this were an outage on a cloud hosted service, I imagine an engineer would just raise the minimum fee to something that would make the attacker burn through his money more quickly (or stop the attack altogether). We'd have this in place probably within an hour (code change needs to be reviewed/tested).

Please read the paper. Do the math. Maybe follow a distributed systems course? 
edit: rather than just be pedantic, I'll try to explain. The problem with Gnutella was that they attempted to do search by scoped flooding. Each search request was forwarded to m neighbours over k hops. So _at most_ a given search query would reach m*k nodes (at most, since there tends to be overlap in the reached nodes). Both m and k were hardcoded. Gnutella's _search coverage_ m*k / N (with N total number of nodes) gets below 1 pretty quick as N goes up, so after a lot of people joined the network a lot of files became unreachable. Bittorrent otoh has centralized search engines (i.e. pirate bay) because search is a fucking hard problem to solve in a distributed way. 
The reason I call upon Gnutella is because they promised something that had been proven _mathematically impossible_. People who claim Bitcoin can scale are doing the same thing.

A quantum attack would reduce the difficulty of calculating a SHA-256 hash, but that doesn't mean that SHA would have to be abandoned. Just switching to SHA-1024 would to the trick for example.

The maximum speed of a circuit depends on the total time it takes for the _output_ to stabilize after the _input_ has changed. This time difference is called the _delay_ or _latency_. A short delay means you can perform the operations many times per time unit (higher frequency), and longer delay means you can perform the operation fewer times (lower frequency). Simple circuits tend to have lower delays, where more complex ones tend to have longer ones. Hardware designers compute the delay of a circuit and set the operating frequency at a 'safe' rate, where they can guarantee correct results every single time.
So what happens if you choose not to wait for the signal to completely stabilize? Well, you sometimes get the right answer, and sometimes you don't. It turns out you can often run circuits at considerably higher clock rates and still get a correct answer say, 90% of the time. 
How useful is a circuit that gives you an incorrect answer 1 out of 10 times? Well, that entirely depends on the application. This paper points out that Bitcoin mining is a great use case because of its inherent parallelism and probabilistic nature. E.g. if your circuit gets it wrong and you publish an invalid block, the rest of the network will still check your work and reject it. Even if some of nodes get it wrong, too, there will always be enough nodes that correctly reject the block for the network to converge to the correct answer.

Quantum computing does not mean that suddenly P==NP. I'm no expert on the subject, but as far as I know only [Grover's Algorithm]( is applicable to SHA, and it reduces the complexity of SHA, in terms of bits, by a factor of about three. So SHA-256 would be reduced to something like SHA-85.

Look, _that only works if technology improvements can keep up with growing TPS rates_. If TPS goes up with a factor of 10 in a year's time, you'd need bandwidth, processing, and storage to become 10 times cheaper within that same year for that argument to not be total bullcrap.

Sure, you can argue that the total amount of _verification_ work is the same for all nodes, but that's completely irrelevant when your network is choking up trying to distribute transactions and blocks.
Every peer-to-peer paper, or indeed distributed systems paper, I have ever read computes message complexity as the _total_ amount of work done in the network. This makes sense, because if you are doing global broadcast like Bitcoin, the total amount of work required to saturate the network with a piece of information is directly related to the network size, topology, and diameter.
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:29:34
This is true for verification processing, because this is simply a replicated operation across all nodes. 
However, the problem is not computation, _it's the network_. Global broadcast, or saturating the network with a piece of information, does depend on network size, topology, and diameter. This is because each node can only perform it's part of the work (forwarding the message) when some other node has finished his. Hence, if n goes up, operations like block propagation take longer and longer.  This is why typically in p2p work you always see people citing the message complexity of the entire network, not just a single node.

The problem with this analogy is that e-mail, http, and all those other now popular technologies have all seen much faster adoption than Bitcoin because at least the use case was clear. It's been around for six years, which is a lifetime in technology, and I'm still having trouble figuring out why the average Joe would use Bitcoin instead of paypal/visa/etc.
Compare this with http: the first spec was written in 1991. Six years on, in 1997, roughly [25% of the American population]( was browsing the internet. Http and html were the killer app that drove internet adoption across the world.
And that's the problem for me when I read comments like this. For e-mail the utility was clear to everybody: send a letter to anybody, anywhere in the world, in seconds! So too for http/html: access a vast amount of information from all over the world! Read the news, chat with people, check your stocks, find recipies!
Now try this with Bitcoin: send money to anyone in the world, quickly and cheaply! Sounds great, but when you think about this, most use cases are already covered by banks, credit card companies, and paypal. Buy something online? Use paypal, visa, or mastercard. Transfer money to another person? Just do a bank transfer (bank transfers are free in most European countries). That leaves remittances, but when you factor in the fees for buying/selling Bitcoin, even if you manage to save money, the added hassle rarely makes it worth it. 
So whichever way you think about the _the average guy/gal simply has no use for Bitcoin_. And if people have to use for something, they're not going to go through the hassle of learning how to use it.
In this respect, Bitcoin and email _are_ very similar. People didn't get internet because they wanted to send messages to their cousins in Australia. They got internet because they wanted to browse the web. They got email in with the bargain, and as more and more people got email addresses, it started to be adopted as a new way to communicate with friends and family. In a way, http/html drove internet adoption, which in turn drove e-mail adoption. 
Maybe I'm wrong and I'm missing something, but from I can tell Bitcoin is lacking a clear driver for adoption. Without it, I don't think you can compare it with the early internet, as so many people in this sub like to do.

Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin really isn't all that complicated, especially if you have background in distributed systems. [Merkle trees]( have been used in P2P systems for a long time, public key crypto has been around for ages, the P2P component of Bitcoin itself is pretty straightforward, etc. I would expect a CS prof to know most, if not all of these concepts.
The novelty is more in how those components are used together, and how mining/hash power is used for majority voting to avoid botnet attacks.
@_date: 2011-09-26 10:34:21
The big flaw in Bitcoin is that it uses global broadcast for spreading transactions around. You can DDOS the network by generating a large number of transactions. Should the Bitcoin community attempt to counter this with transaction fees, you can always rent a couple of thousand of machines from Dimitri the botnet owner, and then have those machines join the Bitcoin network. Now every transaction must be broadcast to all the newly joined nodes, which will generate a shitstorm of data taking down the entire thing (including the 'attacker nodes', of course).
Alternatively, DDOS the biggest mining pools and you get rid of most of the processing power in the network. 
@_date: 2011-05-19 15:56:21
Bitcoin is a scam because anyone with half a brain can see that it _simply won't scale_. Remember that the bitcoin 'paper' was not peer-reviewed by anyone from the peer-to-peer or broader distributed systems community. I'm pretty sure they'd have a tough time getting it accepted anywhere serious. Expect some debunking papers in the next coming months.
If you're going to claim that you achieve both security _and_ scalability in a peer-to-peer system you better damn well back it up. The math just doesn't add up, I'm sorry. If you're going to broadcast every transaction to every node, or even the majority of nodes, you're talking O(n*m) complexity with n as the number of nodes and m the number of transactions. So basically you're double-fucked. 
Bitcoin is not a p2p system, it's a distributed central authority. At some point they're going to have to bring the nodes closer together in the network to get the ridiculously high bandwidth required to transfer those blocks, which means it'll have to run in a datacentre. They're already talking about two-tier systems.
Bitcoin is a scam because there is no way it will scale up to a point that it can replace an actual currency.

You seem to be confusing CS and IT. Computer _science_ is exactly that, the science of computing. This includes topics such as algorithms and complexity analysis, and requires knowledge of discrete mathematics, statistics, graph theory (especially in distributed systems), linear algebra, etc. 


Utter nonsense. The value of a good formal education is that it is technology agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of problems. A good fundamental understanding of computer science will last you a life time. 


You seem to be making the assumption that an advanced degree in CS should prepare you for a life of programming. I can assure you that that's not the case. That's like saying that everybody who is working towards a math degree is working towards becoming a maths teacher.


Again, you are missing the point. A CS degree is not about preparing you for any given job. It is about giving you the strong fundamentals you need to solve difficult problems related to computing. 
I dunno, maybe you just don't have a job that requires such a skill set. But just because you don't know how such skills apply doesn't mean they don't. Why do you think Google likes to hire PhD's and CS masters? Because they have difficult problems that need solving. 
So how does that tie in to getting a job 'in the real world'? Well, where I work, you are not going to get hired if you don't have fundamental knowledge about algorithms and complexity analysis.

That would be stupid. You'd just be adding yourself to the network a few hundred times, which would basically cause the bitcoin network to DDOS you.


What are you basing this one? Intuition? Or are you just randomly pulling stuff out of your ass here? If you increase the number of nodes in the network by a certain factor, the bandwidth required to globally broadcast that information will increase by the same factor. Hence, the impact of a transaction DDOS attack can be greatly amplified by having a botnet participate in the network.


Number of messages exchanged for the global broadcast part has a lower bound of n*m, with n the number of nodes in the network and m the number of transactions. You don't have to be genius to see that this does not scale. You can say 'it's little traffic', but that just means it won't be a problem today. It says absolutely nothing about tomorrow, or next month, or next year.

Most providers don't like it if you move around 5TB of traffic/month (up+down). Even the campus connections for students at my University are capped at 20GB _up_. So even with a University connection, near the national backbone, you still only have &lt;1% of the traffic required available to you.
@_date: 2011-07-04 10:10:59


So now you're saying it only applies to very specific cases of Byzantine Agreement? Would you care to explain how the case you describe is any different from classic Byzantine Agreement? 


There is no such theory. You cannot achieve 100% coverage with arbitrary constants. Hardcoding the number of peer connections like that is pretty much [what killed Gnutella]( Topology of your P2P network has an effect on latency and bandwidth. If you have a ring network the total bandwidth is n blocks every ten minutes, but it takes n transmission times for the data to reach all nodes. You can add more connections to reduce that latency, but then bandwidth goes up. Many topologies exist (trees, hypercubes, skiplists, random graphs, fully connected, etc.) but this is a fundamental tradeoff. 
Either way you have bandwidth constrains and latency contraints, and you have to maintain the network within those two bounds. When traffic goes up, you're fucked because both bandwith and latency increase and topology can't save you from that.


That makes no sense. If I can generate 2000tps you will have to shift several GBs of data every ten minutes. Whether this is segmented every 10 milliseconds or 10 years makes absolutely no difference in terms of bandwidth in the face of a sustained attack.


How do online wallet services reduce the number of tps? What other p2p overhead reduction services are you referring to? Remember that 2000tps is what VISA is doing right now. Should BC become popular beyond mining and investment, this is not an unrealistic rate by any means. In fact, I'd expect it to go way beyond that.


that's quite an assumption to make, especially since it's based on no evidence at all. Remember that 1GB/sec must be available to all nodes by the time BC reaches 2000tps. 


So what you're saying is that it is financially unattractive to try and attack a potentially huge financial system? If BC becomes actually popular, it might have to withstand attacks from the likes of VISA, or perhaps competing cryptocurrencies. As soon as a lot of many is floating around in BC, the cost associated with transaction ddossing might very well be worth it.

Well that's the 'supernode' concept, which is often proposed fix for P2P systems which have traffic problems. It will get you only so far, for two reasons. First, it only raises the ceiling in terms of tps by some constant factor, perhaps an order order of magnitude. So instead of breaking at 2000tps it will break at say, 10000tps. Second, when running a node is not possible for average users you basically go from a system run by the people, to a system run by companies and corporations. It is basically 'all nodes are equal but some are more equal than others', and I'm not sure that this is where people want BC to go. 


The Netherlands. To be fair, the 20GB up cap was to prevent students from running p2p file sharing nodes from their dorms. The reason I used that example is that commodity internet is currently between 20-40Mbit down, and 1-5Mbit up, so University internet is the only cheap connection type I could think of that yields 8Mbit up. We're rolling out fiber though, which would give you anywhere between 100-1000MBit up/down.

Well that's what the Bitcoin guys keep saying on their wiki. Don't worry guys, it'll scale. _We just haven't figured out how to do it yet_. 
And they never will, because when you build a fully connected distributed system that uses global broadcast, you're not actually building a peer-to-peer system, you're building a _replicated server_. Which means you cannot cope with more transactions by adding more nodes, instead, you only make things worse. You can distribute a single node over multiple machines inside a datacentre, but that means the thing will be run by a federation of large corporations. 
It's only popular because it's a magic box that creates money out of thin air. 


When something is too good to be true, it usually is. When there's money involved, it's probably a scam.
Feel free to debate my points if you will, but don't call me retarded simply because you don't understand my argumentation.


I'm simply pointing out what is obvious to people in the distributed systems community, which is that this shit is just not going to scale. Math is not about opinion.

In the current scheme you receive a transaction through global broadcast when it enters the system, and later again as part of a solved block. The 'solution' you provide keeps nodes from having to download a transaction twice, which really is just an optimization that cuts the required bandwidth in two - not a long-term solution by any means, although it does give you a little breathing room. 
The basic foundation of BC is that every node needs to agree on the entire transaction history, and therefore needs to know about _every transaction ever made_. This simply does not scale in terms of bandwidth when the number of nodes or the numer of transactions goes up (or worse, both).

Bitcoin is in the tail of the pump and dump. As long as people are using BC primarily for speculation I doubt we'll see a significant price increase any time soon.

1) record companies didn't spend millions to upload bogus files. Upload bogus files they did, but you're totally pulling the number 'millions' out of your ass.
2) It actually worked a bit, although soon people moved to Bittorrent. Coincidentally its centralized search/tracker design gave people a much better way to find quality content compared to p2p search (which never really scaled anyway, i.e. gnutella).
3) Users will create a filter? What are you proposing, that users will manually inspect network packets and filter out the crap? You want to combat botnet spam by crowdsourcing? Or do you think that 'smart people will solve it for us', even though such a solution would go against the laws of math and physics?
Bitcoin requires a global broadcast mechanism. The idea that you 'need to bring more CPU power than all the friendly nodes combined' is nonsense. As soon as you can ddos a node or otherwise make it impossible for that node to talk to its peers, it doesn't matter how much CPU it has, that node is effectively out of the system. 
OP makes a valid point, the network is a weakness. It's like when ATM machines were introduced and the designers were really worried that the Mafia might kidnap their wives and children to pressure them into giving up technical secrets. No such thing happened, because they simply tied a chain to a truck and tore the things right out of the wall. Everybody has focused so much on the crypto that they forget about communications and bandwidth. 
The ddossing going on right now is a war between pools. If you can't use your botnet to crunch hashes for you, at least you can make them take down the competition. So in that sense a lot of IPs can still beat a lot of CPU cycles.
And then we haven't even talked about scalability yet ...

Byzantine Agreement is a well-known and well-studied _problem_ in computer science for which no efficient (i.e. usable) _algorithm_ exists. Bitcoin attempts to solve this problem in a novel way but has all sorts of scalability issues, some of which I've already described [here]( If you maintain that Byzantine Agreement is solved, this distributed systems researcher would love to see a reference.

Your cellphone cannot spare the energy to mine Bitcoin. Your CPU, Wi-Fi chip, 4G modem, etc. all have pretty aggressively power saving algorithms (e.g. clock scaling, Wi-Fi PSM, polling) because otherwise your phone would either last a few hours at most, or your phone would be 90% battery and weigh a kilogram.
Let's not even talk about heat dissipation. 
Besides, the electricity needed to produce these Bitcoin costs more than said Bitcoin. Why not just buy them directly? 


If I want to buy internet using Bitcoin, why not _just buy Bitcoin_? You know, instead of buying electricity, turning that into Bitcoin (at a loss), and _then_ buying internet? Why can't I just pay my monthly Bitcoin bill instead?
You could implement this right now on current phones without the need for an embedded mining chip. Do you see how the mining capability literally adds _nothing_ but an opportunity for the owner to lose money?


It seems like neither you, me, or anyone really knows what 21inc's business model is. 


This is applying to authority. 


Are you implying 21inc. has a secret plan for success that nobody knows about?
Seems to me they're just sticking a $45 miner on a $35 raspberry pi and selling it for $400 to idiots.
Oh, and burning that sweet, sweet venture capital, of course.

It's called an _echo chamber_, or a group of people that spend a lot of time reinforcing each other's beliefs.
Echo chambers are really powerful. They make people believe in in the weirdest things, like homeopathy, chemtrails, 9/11 being an inside job, religion, Javascript being a great programming language, MLP fanboyism, etc. etc.
While some Buttcoiners are genuinely annoying trolls, a lot of them actually like Bitcoin, but just don't want to live in the 'this is good for Bitcoin' bubble. is being mocked not because of Bitcoin itself, but because of the cult-like echo chamber that it has become.
What is Bitcoin's use case? Remittance? Tipping? Black markets? How are any of these things going to make Bitcoin gain mainstream adoption? I remember when people could ask this question and not be downvoted as a 'troll' or 'shill'.
And for that matter, since when was replacing the dollar even a goal? Remember 'magical internet money'? used to be a place that was able to laugh about itself. Now it has become a place that other people laugh about. And people in here wonder why? You don't need to be a paid shill to look at what has become and shake your head.
The cold hard truth is that outside and _nobody cares about Bitcoin_. 
edit: downvoting this post is not going to make it any less true.

That's only partially true. Yes, you can read about how Bitcoin works from inspecting the source code, and the math and mechanisms behind it, but there's a big difference between theory and practice.
In practice, there's a lot of unknown unknowns that you can only learn about by experimentation, and Bitcoin is just that, an experiment.

While the total volume of water stays constant, but the distribution of the peaks and valleys of the earth surface is not uniform.
Pulling the water up in one place does not neccesarily submerge the same amount of land as is being created in another.

It's even worse for expats, I literally had to take 2k euro out of the country in cash, because I couldn't just wire the money abroad. I had ask a Chinese person to be my go-between because as a non-Chinese I couldn't even convert my RMB into anything else.
For a short while, Bitcoin was a way to magically convert between RMB and USD/EUR, so it makes sense that the government closed this loophole.

Fwiw, Bitcoin is not a distributed system, it's a _replicated_ system. Distributed implies that the functionality of the system is spread out over the machines in the network. Bitcoin is a highly centralized system which is replicated across nodes, and uses mining to establish consensus over what the state of the program should be (byzantine agreement).
