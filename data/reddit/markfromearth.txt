I wish I could go back and edit the video :/
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:49:58
Hell yes! 
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:00:33
Ditto, ditto, and ditto again!
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:24:52
No doubt we'll meet again :) I'll be here for a bit and plan on attending as many BTC meetups here as I can.
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:10:58
So true though, hahaha
He's an alien. Come to help us create and trade cryptokitties
@_date: 2018-09-27 05:42:20
lol I certainly will. I met people who bought btc at $3 and sold at $100 -- for things like cars and furniture. They're kicking themselves... and I might a little bit too ... but not too much. Seeing all these crypto people kicking ass all over the world. Fuggen amazing
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:37:18
haha thanks brofessor
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:57:25
Hit the nail on the head there, John. 
The more people see, the less fear they'll have. And the primary way people will see ... is robustness of the blockchain AND the crypto community.
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:05:10
Hey thanks, man
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:02:28
Holy damn I'm happy this exists!
@_date: 2018-09-27 05:39:01
Most memorable moment...I suppose if we're talking about small slices of time ... then seeing the happiness in kid's eyes at the MOAM restaurant/charity in Cambodia. They're doing charity all right over there. They accepted my tiny BTC donation with tons of gratitude. I wish I could have given more but even that small amount went a long way for them, and they were amazingly grateful for it :)
Most valuable insight...that crypto brings out the good in people. Sure there's always a few bad eggs, but by and large the crypto community is a band of brothers.
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:52:44
Thanks, amigo :)
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:57:08
Only possible with BTC and it's crazy amazing volatility!
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:40:16
Most of my trades were p2p yeah. The demand is strong. Whether it's people who want to be anonymous or people who want to save on btm fees or just people like me passing through. Naturally, during the transaction we need to keep our heads on straight, right? So meet in a public place, verify everything goes through, wait for confirmations, etc
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:54:27
It was surreal. I was walking along a street and passed a restaurant window. Did a double-take. There he was. Filming. Waited until he was done and then asked his body guard for an intro. Bourdain was an amazing dude. He was one of the major inspirations for me setting of on this trip -- because he'd done tough travel too.
@_date: 2018-09-27 05:44:32
Unfortunately :/
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:08:48
Thanks, amigo!
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:52:32
They are quite religious!
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:09:47
But always with fries, lol. 
Serious note though, that girl in China surviving on ketchup packets for a night was intense. Those were some core rules. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:22:21
Before the journey I was an architect. Nothing fancy. Nothing big either. Mostly residential homes, additions, remodels, that sort of thing. Worked for myself for a bit during the housing boom. Struggled a lot during the housing crash. That taught me a number of good hard lessons, I'll tell ya.
The tipping point? My "Quarter-life crises" haha. I had lived in Portland for 30 years. Wanted to see the world. I'd couchsurfed the West Coast a little so I wasn't terribly afraid of traveling on a shoestring. That summer, summer of 2017, I went for it. Spent every other night planning and researching. Went to tons of garage sales looking for traveling bag, boots, stuff like that. Bought my ticket. And flew away.
I decided to stay/live in Poland for a bit, actually. My little savings outside of that 1 BTC go an amazingly long way in this country. Plus it's clean and the food is delicious. So I'll stick around here (Krakow, PL) and try to finish editing the documentary while living off my savings and any crypto donations people might send my way :)
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:49:23
Right?? The food is hearty, city's clean, lots of good spots. What was your favorite?
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:59:56
Now that's an idea. I'll make that happen, thanks
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:25:45
Yeah I've thought about. Per country. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:53:55
Similar case in Myanmar. Out there in the world... shit's gettin real
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:21:27
Goosebumps, eh? 
Oh man, thanks :D
Searching for places was a combo of Google and word of mouth. Most of it came down to word of mouth. For example in Shenzhen I met a miner who bought btc from me for fiat (he was mining AND buying btc. Just couldn't get enough!). He told me about a brewpub called Bionic Brew that accepted BTC directly. I tell you what -- it had been months since I had a real burger and microbrew -- and it was absolutely worth it.
Hardest challenge was never really knowing if I'd have a roof over my head. There were nights where a CS host backed out or simply never responded. I also began wishing for my own refrigerator haha. Just wanted to have a fridge I could wander over to, open the door, see the light come on showing me a selection of snacks. 
Super simple stuff.
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:38:20
For sure!
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:22:43
Counterfeits crossed my mind, to be sure. Once for a slightly larger sum of BTC (December), I met at a bank to verify the bills. I showed them my phone and asked to see the cash. Then I asked to hold the cash while I hit send and waited. It wasn't ever awkward. In fact for most of the guys I could see a smirk that I was being so paranoid -- since they'd transacted like this hundreds of times. 
Again though -- I wasn't transacting fat stacks :P Just enough to keep me going for a couple weeks at a time.
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:04:55
Well I dunno about that! But thanks for the encouragement :)
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:38:20
He stirs the pot, no doubt about it haha
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:25:15
Thanks for the feedback! Especially "that will get people free and change the world for the best." &lt;--- that's the key right there. Crypto will set people free. Financial freedom, freedom of speech. These will change the world. And we can push for them to become reality. 
Way to go with the apartment host conversion :D One at a time eh? haha.
Cheers and keep rocking.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:43:26
In the famous words of Nike .... just do it :P
Hitchhiking will save you tons + get to meet amazing ppl. And when you get to Europe drop me a line! 
Let's meet up for a pint. I'll probably still be in Krakow.
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:47:56
I haven't seen a way to do it. Youtube only lets me trim it (shorten) or add cards and links. But no adding additional footage :(
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:50:27
And now with the genocide...
It's heartbreaking. 
People there are so kind. I had to slowly let my guard down because in Thailand people kept trying to scam me. But in Myanmar people were genuinely interested in talking to me and even helping.
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:28:12
And that's what makes for good TV, isn't it :P
Look at the comment he made to me. About the polar bears. Completely idiotic? Absolutely. But also hilarious in a "WTF did he just say" way? that too.
He lives by the rule: all publicity is good publicity. And thus provides us saner folk with the other end of the scale.
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:40:49
I was honestly surprised as time went on.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:56:13
Soon! I hope. For now I have the trailer and 178 hours of footage to chew through. But I'll get it into one solid film, eventually :) stay tuned!
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:34:30
Now that's an idea I didn't think about. Like a QR code on screen for the last few seconds?
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:33:01
Massive travel hacking and planning. Couchsurfing saved on accommodation, public transport on getting places, and most of all ... I went to cheap places!
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:42:40
Fair point, fair point. The actors on The Onion make it look so damn easy. What could be easier than reading a few lines in a straight voice? But no. It's tough. Thanks for the fair comments.
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:33:31
 Did you ever watch The Onion? That satire news channel? Well, I'm starting something similar. Focused on crypto only.  Satire and dry comedy in the crypto space. Production budget is hella low, though.  Bare with me. R
@_date: 2019-02-28 11:37:28
Thanks, amigo :)
Still trucking along here. I'll post updates soon! I'm writing a book about it :)
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:17:12
"Notable character in my tale." Sounds like I'm Frodo Baggins. I like it :P
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:50:20
Very nearly sometimes. Fortunately there were always buses full of chickens and couches to crash on :)
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:19:06
I'll run one of those kindle promo's at some point fo sho
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:53:49
Thanks for the support :D
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:09:29
hahah 'bored smothered souls' -- that they are indeed.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:12:59
hahah what a sensational username. Would it be fitting to say 'you know nothing, Bitcoin Bastard?" :P 
But then again when it comes to btc and blockchain, the rabbit hole goes so deep that most people know nothing..
Hm, looks like I made it available worldwide. Is it not showing up for the UK?
@_date: 2019-04-24 06:51:38
Holy damn. This is enlightening. Thank you. Hm. Alright I'll mix in more words from the list. That'll be a step I know how to do. Otherwise perhaps I should study up on how people go about cracking these things. Because I'm trying to make this word puzzle wallet entertaining, right? Not something that someone with money to burn can crack just by throwing money at GPU arrays -- but instead a word puzzle for wordsmiths, fans of crossword puzzles, and people who enjoy scrabble :P
Basically make it a head scratcher. Something fun. A mystery to solve.
But clearly this will be a challenge.
@_date: 2019-04-24 06:53:43
It's quite fitting. A connection to a 'Diagon alley' of mysterious and awesome stuff :P
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:24:33
Leo in HK? Yeah I crashed his couch and went to a few meetups with him :)
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:44:43
How about this link?
Hope it works. Perhaps the ebook is just too new to appear? I don't know how Amazon's algo's work :/
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:54:06
Ok, ok. constructive feedback. I can appreciate that. 
I'm trying for the first tone (frugal traveling mixed with surprising misadventures). I suppose I am too close to the trees and see it as far more interesting than I can describe. What would be a good hook? One that might peak your curiosity, for instance?
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:23:40
Really?? Shit. I'm not terribly familiar with cracking codes. If you have a minute perhaps you have suggestions on making it tougher? I figured 12 words in 80,000 would be difficult to crack since the seed phrase also needs to be in a certain order.
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:42:53
Fascinating. Just fascinating. How so much of life can boil down to numbers. Like the myth I hear -- or perhaps it's true -- that everything ever is located somewhere in the infinity of 3.14 Pi (perhaps even my book haha). 
Okay, so use as many of the 2048 BIP39 words as possible. Got it. 
Unfortunately, besides the C++ course I took 10 years ago in college, I'm not one for coding. 
I did send a PM your way though.
lol windows
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:51:31
The experience was the best part of it all. By that I mean the crypto communities around the world. 
Before traveling I'd suggest finding the main community in each city you plan to visit. Reach out to the main organizer/s -- tell them you're traveling through and want to get to know the crypto community. It's always bigger than whoever attends each month's meetup. 
As far as traveling: couchsurfing, hitchhiking, and things like that if you're on a budget. Hostels even if you're not on a budget -- because he people you'll meet there are usually quite cool.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:20:27
Count on it.
Budget may be tight, but this means too much to me. I won't half-ass it.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:24:28
Yeah? That's the writing 'voice' I'm trying to develop. I'll need an editor to help nail it down. Bring out that voice. Too bad it's not part of a series. That way I could improve. But it's just this one shot.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:06:54
Thanks, amigo :)
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:15:17
You lucky dog, snatching that epic node name up like that. Fitting too, for a 'lightening' network haha. I'll pass it along the people I know who are looking for connections!
And yes, I'll make a note and come back with the audiobook. I am planning it, after all. Might even voice it myself -- if I can get my mic to work properly...
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:01:07
I think someone mentioned this below. I'm too close to the story to describe it correctly :/
No, what happened is that I went to a meetup in Hong Kong -- regular old meetup -- and happened to meet a fellow who DID make a killing. I told him about my attempt to travel around the world on 1 BTC -- he thought it was interesting and that turned into many crazy invites. 
But I need to condense that into a sentence somehow..
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:33:40
A smart strategy. Wish I could too. Perhaps with enough books sold :)
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:17:41
Don't I know it. My friends and family said it'd pop (@ $5k) and I'd end in a ditch. I still ended in a ditch but man the ride was wild :p
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:18:00
Lol. That Chinese girl was interesting. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:21:43
Thanks :) Let me know if this is something I should think about offering for print in bulk? I've heard of Ingram and lulu.
It's funny I debated between spelling it traveled and travelled. The first is the American way of going about it, the second is UK and my auto-correct highlights it haha. Still debating!
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:17:29
Thanks amigo
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:11:14
At first, for the first several months in fact, I was quite scared of counterfeiter money. But I went by the sellers and buyers ratings. They were trusted. So I learned to trust them. 
At first I held the money in my left hand while they held it too. Quite comical actually!
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:07:55
 Europe is quite nice for a change. Cold now though...
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:09:39
For most people it certainly is. And rightly so. Loads of people want a bed, their own room, and decent places to eat. But when you give that up, as I did, travel becomes quite cheap. Cheaper than living at home in some cases...if you're from a first world country anyway. I couchsurfed a lot (stayed on peoples couches or floors). And I ate streetfood from carts and vendors.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:19:06
For the memories yes....for the years of chiropractic work I'll need to fix my back from all those couches and floors I slept on, not so much haha
I joke. Traveling on that thin of a budget has many downsides but yes, the memories and upsides are worth it
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:16:56
He's a character!
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:19:15
Thanks amigo
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:16:41
Most certainly point it out. But let me also point out a counter... if I had thousands of dollars worth of ... dollars ... it would still be the same thing in 90% of the places I went to. If I went to a hotel or a restaurant and whipped out a benji, sure they would know it's valuable and all that, but they still wouldn't take it. Even if they knew the conversion rates off the top of their heads...it might still be against policy.
And sure I could go to an exchange....but that's what I was doing with BTC
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:09:55
I might just do that!
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:14:23
Quite popular, actually. Especially in countries where btc is still repressed or illegal (China in a way). Plus the anonymity encourages people. I did quite a bit of p2p, especially after my Bitpay VISA stopped working. It was scary at first, but safe. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:08:03
Indeed!
