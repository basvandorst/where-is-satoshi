Had read the article yesterday. i hope these guys are legit. the list of countries where it is accepted at the bottom has pakistan listed as middle east, whereas it actually belongs to asia. also there is no place as Bengal. Bangladesh maybe, but no country is called Bengal. i would not transfer BTC to a company that cant figure out its geography.

something happened with me last year, took all the advice available off the internet, did rescan multiple times, didnt startup qt for a few days, nothing seemed to work. Imported the private key from the debug window, and using another wallet where you can import private keys, i had used blockchain, you may use another, had that addresses balance available over there, and was able to send money. Didnt use bitcoin qt for over 6 months, once i started up, all was well.

after about 4 and a half hours of restarting the node and changing the conf file, mempool size is {"size" : 1150, "bytes" : 1718073} and memory usage by qt is half what it was before. However, the mempool seems very empty. Am i being too restrictive with the config?

6,26,584k is the memory being used by bitcoin qt. i think i am going to adjust my conf file. been a long time pending. restarting it is not an option every few hours.

Zebpay by far will work out the fastest and cheapest at this time. Another option is Localbitcoins though I suggest creating your own ad to buy rather than buying from someone else.

As an example can you explain what will be the fees if you were to use western union. As of now the best bet would be to use Unocoin though because of their limit of 10 Btc a day, it may take you up to a week to offload all the coins. Other option would be to sell to the buyers on Localbitcoins, and sell all in one go, but you will not get that great a price. At this time, roughly 6-7 $ lesser than Unocoin for a bitcoin.
