Look at the old graph before the spike appeared and btc was pumped to 760, the btc price was at 380-460. I don't think its gonna go below that, even if it IS (because of panic) i don't think it will be too long. 
Rather than sell, maybe you should just buy even more if the price goes lower.

Anyone knows how many so called "shares" there will be issued ? At least approximately ? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:03:08
Does anyone know how many shares there will be?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:00:26
400000 ?! Holy shit, thats a lot. Thanks, this will help define approx. price when bfx will launch.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:48:14
You can only buy btc in US with Cashapp right? UK is not supported yet?
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:50:17
They probably tried to take cash not BTC
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:17:50
So as I understabd you are European? Order Revolut card, create an account and you will be able to do SEPA transfers through Revolut to Bitstamp
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:04:33
There should be a way to isolate links from getting them those free clicks
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:34:42
Zigzag.io one that i remember. There is quite few of them already. But probably would be easier just to open another channel. its good for redudancy and you will have some available capacity on the first one if someone sends you some coins. Also later if you want to pool them you can easily transfer leftovers from one channel to another.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:30:22
This is actually cute
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:48:17
Is there any alternatives with free withdrawals and SEPA transfers?
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:19:34
It was fun af and funny, good job mate. Made $16M dollars. Wish even if a fraction of it would be real heh.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:59:13
+1 for Kraken, best exchange, never had problems so far. Free SEPA deposits and (€0.09) withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:13:21
I semi-understand what this collision is "2 different data sets sharing the same hash" but wtf exactly happened here? What kind of data was collided that he was able to get private key of these bitcoins? ELI5?
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:30:49
im so fucking tired of the china shit
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:46:16

Hey, few weeks ago I created dummy store on wordpress, you can test lighting payments if you interested.
Use my 50 sats for it that i just tipped you.  
Download BlueWallet from Google Play.  
Create lighting wallet.  
Create an invoice for 50 sats, copy the "address".  
Withdraw money to your wallet using lptip bot (send him a pm with text "!withdraw "address".  
Go to my dummy website for lighting payments:.   [SpendSats.fun](   
Have fun testing it.
@_date: 2019-03-01 23:02:37
I'm out of the loop i guess, which bug?
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:46:29
Its alright bro, you gonna see this price and even above.
Maybe this thread will make you feel better: 
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:42:12
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:06:39
everything will be alright bro ;) hold tight
@_date: 2019-03-24 10:29:33
Wtf, he got gold gold for that?

N-N-NN-Nooo!!! this meme always brings bad luck smh
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:51:31
Awesome, keep up the good work! I feel ashamed that yet im not contributing anyhow except shitposting.
But soon.. i hope..
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:31:58
What does he mean?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:49:20
I'm doomed with 150sat/b transaction 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:18:17
Maybe it shows your BTC as Euros? Like, this is what you would get if you would sell it now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:02:12
Amazing news. When i see the store that uses bitpay as a merchant i always try to contact them and suggest an alternative. Such a pain in the ass payment provider.
@_date: 2019-08-02 00:38:59
This is actually why sometimes i think about bitcoin distopia. Why buy, create something? Just hold bitcoin and you are good.
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:38:57
Excellent, all we need now is somehow to solve inbound problem on 0 balance in a non-custodial way and then even my grandpa will be able to use lighting network.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:09:41
Cheers, doing KYC now. Sounds promising.
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:39:24
Hahaha, thanks for 10 bucks, have twenty back!

Robinhood used to sell just a btc promise not the real bitcoin. You couldn't withdraw them. Maybe they changed it.

Rather than use estimations by websites, i usually just check mempool myself to deside how long i can wait:  is quite neat tool for that
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:01:33
This is actually smart thing to do
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:12:44
Damm this shit grins my gears, what a nonsense. Its not only forbes, lots of them postingtl this shit. Bitcoin uptrend started way before libra shitcoin got announced.
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:05:01
That's what I'm saying, ignore estimations, just check mempool yourself. For example mempool.space shows the last 5 blocks average fees, now i know there is blocks mined with avarage of 3sat/bytes, then i check mempool on the left, it looks quite empty not even a single block gets full yet. So now i confidently can tell that my transaction with 3sat/byte will get confirmed as fast as 10minutes or in the next hour.  My transaction to open lightning channel just got confirmed with 3sat/byte for example.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:43:31
Hey mate, despite the circumstances i hope you are doing well. Everytime i read a post like this I always think that could be me as well. Just a stupid mistake, a mistake that i didn't even knew I did. 
A lot of people think that it may be linked to the same issue like the other guy who lost the funds using the same wallet because of the spell checker. (aka Google employee stole it) Well, as a possibility it can happen but i turn to think that in reality -  It's hardly believeable. We can't ignore the fact they made a mistake leaving the spell checker On, but there is something else I want to share and ask.
Coinami mobile app doesn't use JxBrowser for a their wallet. That means there is no google spell checker on their app. When we sum up everything, the correlation between two stories is definitely not the spell checker. 
Even though i have some legitimate concers about the other guy and his story, I'm genuinely feeling sorry for you.
We can try to find out what happened to your phone and your seeds.
How long do you have that phone? Did you bought it new? Have you ever (the whole time you owned the phone) installed apps outside google store aka direct installation of apps by enabling 3rd party sources in android settings? (.apk packages). Think really well.

Send me invoice back for 7000 lets try reverse now ��

We should teach her to accept lightning

@_date: 2019-06-27 18:59:22
I used kraken mostly, its a bit slow platform but okay, dont really like the withdrawal tax of 0.0005. I did the kyc yestarday with bitstamp, already approved my sepa transfer, didn't even took one day, its crazy. Also has an app.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:38:51
I agree, its time to shift to satoshis. So far almost all of lightning network wallets use Satoshis by default, lets hope it will stay that way.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:31:41
Lets try it! :)
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:39:14
True. I really hope all the lighting wallets always gonna use satoshis by the default.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:32:10
Don't bother, apparently you will have to buy 10% in shitcoins if u want to use their service.
Just wasted my time..
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:28:12
120k btc if i remember correctly. It was quite a huge deal at the time, price crashed for five mins to 450 Dollars at one point. Of course it recovered quite fast.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:23:08
Few years ago I would get really pissed of the ignorance of the writer but now, after all btc had to come through (forks, ver shitcoins, bitmain monopoly), its actually makes me giggle.  
I'm feeling stronger as a person now that I can laugh and not get angry seeing articles like this.  
Feeling chill, going to get a coffee, gonna read about lighting development, great day ahead.

As long as you have a good marketing plan, go for it mate.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:08:36
Got it as well, i thought i should post it here, glad someone already did
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:51:47
I believe from $800. Ehh, good times, I remember guys panicking on poloniex trollbox and predicting the doom for btc :) Simpler times, really.
Jokes aside, it's amazing how far BTC have come in just few years.
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:56:15
Not my thread but i also have a question: has anyone tried to script auto payments from one address to another, eg. Hot wallet address receives coins and then imidiatly send them to cold storage address ? Something like .addeventlistener on js but for bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-08 10:46:47
Considering how fast bitcoin recovered form bitfinex crash it seems people more and more trust bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised to see huge pump of bitcoin in incoming months
@_date: 2016-09-11 11:10:13
Well, fuck.
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:39:19
Its real, the times newspaper. Its an ad by bitmex

Oh mate, im gonna gamble the hell out of these 10 satoshis
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:41:28
Holy shit i didn't knew that. I stopped following bitcoin surrounding news after bcash/btc war escalated. Couldn't bare the shitposts and my hate for him. If this story at least a little bit truth that's such a good news.

Why its so popular in UK? I find revolut better for traveling (or for sepa transfers)
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:47:29
Oh man, thats sucks, busy mempool for the past few days. As i can see you send 373bytes transaction with a fee of 0.0001, I, myself sent 191bytes transaction with the same fee and still unconfirmed after 6 hours, Its gonna take a while for you...
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:39:39
Lol, i thought you were joking
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:30:10
Cash App doesn't work in UK, right?
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:11:54
It's already happening with lighting network and I hope it's gonna stay that way
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:08:18
Cheers for that, maybe thats why i can't import seeds using it. Trying now.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:06:34
If you are using any decent normal wallet, it usually generates the seed for you at the beginning of usage (12 or 24 words) and tells you to save it in a safe place. Same with  hardware wallets. If you can't export keys or seeds it probably means you using a custodial aka centralized (like a bank) exchange and what it usually means if website goes bankrupt, hacked or owners disappears you will lose your money.
There is one golden rule on bitcoin: If you don't control thr keys, bitcoins aren't yours. It means you can lose them and believe me it happens a lot.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:35:56
Its the seed you want to protect at all costs. What you gonna do if it breaks, doesn't turn on for whatever reason?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:25:12
? You won't lose your coins if you have written down your seed/private key.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:04:37
Cheers mate, I was considering using Electrum but unfortunately he have never used bitcoin before so we agreed that I'll introduce him to it and help him to store bitcoins safely which is nice. One more person on board, haha
I also found website [bitrated]( which looks quite simple and promising for escrowed trades.
