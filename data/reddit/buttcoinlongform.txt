What I don't understand about you guys get so upset over censorship (which is certainly happening), yet you give that dipshit clown a pass for embezzling $500,000.00 and "paying" some wholly-inexperienced college friends to "develop a forum", which shockingly, nearly 2 years later now, is still no where to be found.
How is censorship getting so much exposure right now and no one here ever gives a shit about the person who controls and bitcointalk.org literally stealing money from your pockets?
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:38:11
Uh, neither. A regulated market with "many alternatives" is handily the best market. There is such a thing as over/under regulation, but that doesn't mean you throw the baby out with the bathwater
Regulation is why I don't have to worry about Vanguard pulling a Gox and disappearing with all my money

As a software dev I just wanted you to know my eye physically twitched reading that. Good god.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:38:18


Turns out a regulated industry makes it incredibly easy to open an investment account online, *without getting scammed*.
Conversely, bitcoin (lol).

Because there's a chance some of the people in here are not insane and can get help before pissing away their life savings into a pump and dump scheme.
It never ceases to amaze me how nuts bitcoiners get when someone points out the horrific flaws in their funbux. I'm a software developer, just trying to help people out before they become yet another submission in @_date: 2015-08-01 17:21:15
RE: the leaked Mt. Gox database, would you happen to recall if the suspicious account(s) had strange ID values, or just in general if the leaked Mt. Gox database looked legit to you?

1) You have no idea how to properly formulate an argument and it's somewhat embarrassing. In this case you're putting words in my mouth and then going "Aha! Got you, statist!" A true masterstroke, haha.
2) If you ever want to have grown up people conversation you're going to have to reassess your ridiculous verbiage of "violence", arbitrary disparagement of that mean ol' state, arbitrary disparagement of those mean ol' banks. Again, can you recall for me the last time a bank literally absconded with the entirety of their customers' deposits, and disappeared, leaving their customers empty handed? No? Funny, that's strangely commonplace in the free market Bitcoin la-la-land
3) A regulated market by definition requires enforcement of the regulations and applicable laws, you klutz. It is literally the polar opposite of your dear free market. Meanwhile, in Bitcoin free market land, every other week a major exchange gets "hacked" or just openly exit scams some gullible bitcoiners into losing their life savings (slash allowances). Or an insider trade bot on Mt. Gox or more recently Bitfinex siphons money out by arbitrarily increasing fake demand/volume. You know where this doesn't happen? In a regulated market. It's called insider trading and fraud.

How is giving a dose of reality being "a shitty troll"?
How is bitcoin "innovative" when it's horribly inefficient compared to modern standards, and even if devoting 100% of its processing capacity couldn't keep up with 1/10th a single company's transactions?
"But it's decentralized." Yeah, who gives a shit about being decentralized when it is absolutely crippled by horrible transaction processing &amp; **every single transaction is subsidized by printing ~$3.40 out of thin air?** You're buying a $0.99 cup of coffee with bitcoin and $3.40 is magically donated to a miner to process that single transaction. You don't think that's a major, major flaw?
Then you remember a transaction can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 6 hours to confirm, so you're waiting at the cashier for 6 fucking hours to buy a $0.99 cup of coffee that was subsidized to the tune of $3.40, **and you genuinely believe this novelty toy is the wave of the future?**
I can't say that I apologize for not participating in the echo chamber.

ITT: We make shit up
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:10:35


If it can't process 1/10th a single company's transactions, then how is bitcoin anything but a cute little novelty toy? **How is it innovative when it is decidedly worse than existing centralized solutions?**
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:34:54
It's amusing watching sovcitz twits play economics, lol.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:03:41


No, I'm pretty certain the Bitcoin mods are incompetent, letting your little campers run rampant brigading every financial / country-specific subreddit in a desperate attempt at getting a pump going. 
How many times have I seen the top post in this shitty sub being a link to, say, or linking to some boorish bitcoiners trying to preach the gospel to some poor people in a developing country? **And you, the laughably incompetent / conniving mods of let it happen. Every. Time.**
You people make me sick, and then have the nerve to act haughty about it? Ugh.
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:09:16
was it the username? great sleuthing, hoss.
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:36:08


1) why would Reddit want to, as a 'rational actor', decentralize itself, and thus make itself obsolete, and turn a poor revenue generator into a nothing revenue generator?
2) why would Reddit want to pay you to do this? This is how I know for sure you're clearly just making things up.
3) is javascript seriously the only language you know? because it's embarrassing if that is the case
4) did you even stop for a moment to consider how shitty a "decentralized reddit" would be? 10 minutes for anyones post to show up, but given the volume of posts (several tens of millions a day), you'll probably have to wait MUCH much longer (given bitcoin's hilarious 233,280 transaction limit). It's actually much more likely that your post never appears, given the memory constraints. Oh, and every user has to download the fucking blockchain, because thats not super ridiculous.
5) is there any concept you won't clumsily try to shoehorn bitcoin into?
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:25:13
wow impressive, how did you ever figure that out?
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:29:54
Pretty sure I didn't, since no one has refuted any of the points I made about bitcoin being a wholly inefficient piece of shit that can't handle any transaction volume and socializes the true cost of the 'currency' and serves no purpose except enabling pedos and drug addicts to suit their fancy
But don't let me interrupt the echo chamber, haha
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:51:33


Uh, yeah they do. How the fuck else do you explain countries existing. They weren't artificially constructed, dipshit, they evolved into existence over generations.
You dipshit libertarians just want to return to feudalism for some godforsaken reason, presumably because you (comically) believe you'd be the landed gentry (lol) rather than the peasants.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:00:46
* 2.7 transactions per second (lol)
* 10 minutes to six hours to confirm
* irreversible (which is a blatant, unfixable defect)
* $3.40 printed out of thin air to pay to a miner for every transaction
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:22:59
His public doxxing of a customer by raiding company databases comes to mind. For his own mistake, no less.
Or the whole "is a convicted felon for illegal distribution of unmarked explosives via the regular mail system and storing explosives in his apartment block".
Or the fact that his twitter icon is a picture of himself quoting himself.
Or the fact that he shilled for Mt. Gox, vouching for its solvency literally days before it imploded.
But given that you're a sovcit twit, you're likely to look past all this and make irrational, emotional decisions about who you support, lol.
