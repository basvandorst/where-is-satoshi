People like Roger usually bring about their own undoing.

Yes, and it's good practice to do this anyway with a tiny fraction of your stash just to make sure you are familiar with the recovery process.

Same here. I've been waiting on a sizable withdrawal via wire transfer since 5 Dec. I opened a ticket yesterday after waiting a week and they replied this morning with a generic "we're busy" message. I don't mind waiting, it's the total lack of updates that annoys me.

Good for you. I'm genuinely pleased to hear this worked out well for you and your kids. Well done.

Yep. It's literally not worth my time for the money I would save.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:03:58


Yeah but spending money on telling someone to fuck off makes it slightly more insulting. Like taking off a glove before slapping someone across the face.

At least you had the opportunity to buy. Saw this coming but my SEPA transfer still hasn't cleared on Stamp. FML!

**Community guideline 
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

Check out the [Bitcoin FAQ]( sticky. It contains a lot of useful information for beginners including how to buy and store bitcoins safely.

Same thing happened to me in the UK trying to transfer to Bitstamp's Slovenian bank. My transfer was denied by the money transfer company because their compliance team said they were "unable to facilitate the purchase of unregulated products like Bitcoin".

That is absolute robbery. Not that it makes much difference but OP's charge was £25 (~$32) not $25 but even so. I used to bank with HSBC and they charge £4 for international transfers which is far more reasonable. It makes you wonder how much profit the banks make from these charges alone.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:10:45
How you feeling today OP?
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:37:16
I've had to pay this shit charge twice in the last month. They also gave me a GBP -&gt; EUR rate of 1.0-something which was well below the spot rate at the time and I was moving five figures. 
AFAIK Santander have the most expensive money transfer fees of all the high street banks. If you have an account with a different bank send from there instead. 
Bitcoin revolution can't come quick enough!

Those cursed landlubbers who be sailin' under the flag o' Santander.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:01:54
I've heard of them but not used them. I tried to use a specialist money transfer provider last month but I failed their compliance because they don't allow Bitcoin purchases! Also I've found out since that Bistamp don't accept bank transfers from accounts that are not in the customer's name so this wouldn't have worked anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:23:15
Never used freelancer.com but a common tactic used by scammers is to pay over-the-odds for BTC, wait until they've received it, then recall the original payment. Your BTC is now sitting in someone else's wallet and there is absolutely no recourse you can take to recover the money.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:39:23
I don't use them myself but Coinbase have a recurring payments option that allows you to buy BTC regularly over time. I don't know if this is just for US bank accounts but you can read more information on their blog post [here]( Good luck.

Doesn't seem like a sensible option to me. You'd lose money on the USD -&gt; AUD conversion, then again on the AUD -&gt; BTC conversion. However assuming you already have this card with funds loaded on, I guess it would just be classed as a domestic payment. I'm not sure how the fees stack up in the US, but in the UK there are additional charges for using your card outside of the specified currency (usually called the FX or Foreign Exchange fee) and these can be 2-5%, plus you may also be charged a transaction fee on top of everything else. Travel money cards are really designed to be used in the country / currency specified; if you deviate from this they'll slap you with charges wherever they can.

OP I took the time out to complete the survey but it wouldn't allow me to submit because I didn't answer every single question on the last section:
"One or more mandatory questions have not been answered. You cannot proceed until these have been completed."
I don't have an answer to some of these questions so I am unable to continue. Can you make these non-mandatory? It will probably improve your completion rate.

From what you've said it sounds like Windows has become corrupted but your files are safe? If so, you could try just plugging your HD into another computer either directly or by using an external enclosure and accessing your files from there.

Nevermind. The sell order didn't trigger after all but also didn't show up in my open orders book. Luckily I managed to cancel it just before the price corrected.

Thanks for the reply. I actually don't have any issues with Bittylicious as a platform but the last couple of trades I have done made me nervous about sending large amounts due to  minor hiccups with the sellers / selling process. 
Earlier this year a seller said they hadn't received a £1k payment I sent before apologising 30 mins later and saying they made a mistake. A couple of months later I sent £2.2k to another seller who said they hadn't received the money despite the payment leaving my account. This time my bank was at fault because I received an automated call from them some time later asking me to verify I made the payment. Both times I received the Bitcoin but watching the screen update to tell me payment had not been received was too nerve-racking to try again with larger amounts. I would use Bittylicious again but probably keep orders &lt;£1k.

I can't help you with the BTC thing, sorry, but it seems strange to me that she would rather drop the project than accept payment in fiat. Surely anything is better than nothing?

Bitstamp goes hella slow during big crashes but it never shits the bed like Coinbase does.

I assumed it fell under Capital Gains Tax as well. I haven't asked my accountant as I'm not planning on cashing out yet but from the conversations I had with my previous accountant and IFA neither of them had much of an idea of what bitcoins were, let alone their tax status.
Capital Gains Tax according to [Gov.uk](


Income Tax on the other hand is paid on income which suggests to me that you'd be liable to pay this if you were trading for a living. Maybe try asking in [@_date: 2017-06-06 11:48:44
I am not an expert but I think you may be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax. Looks like there are specific cases for "personal possessions" that have increased in value and I assume BTC would fall under this remit: [

Thank you for the explanation. What do you predict will happen based on the facts so far?
