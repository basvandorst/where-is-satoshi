I get it man. I'm in the same boat, yesterday we were late for dinner for about 30 mins and she gave me a lot of shit for it. 
Real reason was because I was making 300usd on a single trade haha but when I talk about it, she feels bad Because she hasn't gotten paid yet. She just started working.

Actually you will not believe If i told you how much of the insurance banks provide for safety deposits given that thats what they used to keep their keys.
You have purchase the insurance separately from the third party which costs you a lot

Get one!
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:53:52
Can't send and receive yet right?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:13:00
You're so wrong my friend. Banks do need xrp for settlement. 
Banks won't be like "Yeah I just sent you xrp, did you receive"
No. 
Banks need ILP and xRapid. These both can't function without xrp.
It's just a matter of time.

You guys are fucking awesome! Amazing product! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:42:06
I wouldn't risk anything without correct replay protection in place and tested. They said the trading can start by 1st November. That would be safe to sell then 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:50:29
sold at 700 too
bought back at 1200 
sold some at 5200 fml 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:29:20
