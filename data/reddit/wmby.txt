I read quite a few bad reviews of both of those services but signed up with Circle anyways. My account has been waiting to be verified for a few hours though they do say it could take a few business days. Some of the sign-up requirements felt a little invasive but it's not the end of the world. So those 2 are my only options to buy bitcoins safely with a debit card? Will any of what I'm trying to do have anything to do with the Blockchain.info wallet I created or was that unnecessary?

At the end of the day though I would have to trust that you'll do what you say right? I don't mean to imply you're untrustworthy, but I'm assuming you'd send me a request for money with something like PayPal, then I could just use my debit card and then you'd send me a Bitcoin code, or are you on ACR already and can p2p transfer?

Thanks for the heads up, and luckily I'm with Chase, but who knows if they're gonna be any more lax than BoA

I have an old PayPal acct I'm trying to reactivate/update it right now. I appreciate your willingness to help me out. I've been placing pretty well in free poker tournaments and can't wait to be able to play for some kind of stakes (even if they're only gonna be $.50 or a dollar). I don't expect you to be waiting with rapt attention so I will try and initiate some kind of contact with you through email before I go sending anything.

Awesome thank you!
