I suggest to ask questions that you want to be answered.  
What wallet is most secure ?  
What wallet is easy to use ?  
What wallet provides private keys?  
What wallet...?  
I recommend mycelium. Works great, is showing the current price on various exchanges and you can select 2 currencies to be shown. For further questions please ask.

Give it time, my friend. Everything looks confusing for the first time.  
The first and most important tip I can give you : if you are unsure about what does something in the wallet, google it. 
The second is : back up your master seed ( 12 words phrase ) and put a pin on that wallet.  
The third is : write down your master seed and pin on a piece of paper. Follow me again : write down your master seed and pin on a piece of paper.  
 That piece of paper is going to be your second most important think next to your life. Take good care of it because it contains your bitcoins. You lose the phone ? It gets stolen ? It breaks ?  
No worries, you have your master seed. Install Mycelium on a new phone and chose to import a wallet based on your master seed.  
Congratulations, you got your bitcoins back ! 
Do not enter the pin while connected to internet ( better be safe than sorry ). 
This link should answer your most basic questions :   
If you have further questions please feel free to message me or reply to this message. Keep your coins safe !  
P.S. : Do not tell anyone, I mean anyone, ever, about your piece of paper with the master seed and pin. No one, ever, never. And keep it somewhere safe, maybe write its location in a cryptic code "Treasure island in the attic" so you do not forget where you put the paper then store the paper with the location in your fiat wallet.
