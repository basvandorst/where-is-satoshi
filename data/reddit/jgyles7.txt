It does not download the entire blockchain and easy to make or convert to an offline wallet.

Yes sir, I purchased the boots for .17991716 BTC totaling $108.95 &amp; was refunded .17485435 BTC totaling $108.95.
I was given the current Coinbase exchange rate equaling the price of the original purchase =))
And they paid the return shipping cost, pretty incredible experience!!
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:29:53
Exactly what I did, thank you kindly =))

I think you are looking for something sort of like this::

Google software engineer talking about making Bitcoin transactions more user friendly and implementing a more appealing UI address protocol so we don't have to see the big long addresses!!

Thanks I'll check it out =))
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:54:15
Can you suggest a title? I've been getting bashed for this title. LOL, I don't think it's misleading but more than one person said so....
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:37:25
Yep =| "Beginning to end!" We can't edit a post title after it's been posted, only comments can be edited.

Hey thanks a lot bitcoinchamp =)) I know the idea is unique, but maybe its not such a great idea and it would get destroyed by this community! But, until I know it's viability, sharing it in an open forum is the last thing I would do. I think it's a phenomenal idea. 
I appreciate your words and believe it or not appreciate the words of the poo poo'ers and naysayers as well..

Great video, what a terrific Bitcoin Proponent Patrick Byrne is =))
I purchased Work Boots from Overstock with BTC and the transaction went flawlessly: 
Then had to return them and that went flawlessly also: 
They provided me a free shipping return label, tracking number and they refunded in BTC, the full USD amount I originally paid for the item and refunded the BTC's to my Coinbase account the same day they received the Boots back.
I will be writing a glowing Yelp review touting thier products/ customer service &amp; of course Bitcoin's ease of usage =))
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:05:26
This worked like a charm =)) Didn't see the SELL option my first time around. Much thanks..
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:37:18
Thanks! As long as I'm not S.O.L and my BTC's are stuck in a dead wallet forever, that was my concern =)) I'll figure out that Nod, Own Server deal should that occasion ever arise but sounds like Electrum has everyone's blessing.
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:08:59
Exact USD amount paid for the item paid was refunded to Coinbase =))
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:28:37
you replied on my reply?
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:19:16
You CAN purchase then instantly at whatever the current price is at the time you buy them... You just don't receive them to put into your own wallet until until your chosen Exchange receives the funds from your financial institution..
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:42:59
My bad, needed to put something to save the post. Not that reddit savvy yet, nor do I care about votes. I found the video interesting and was just wanted to share it =))
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:11:58
I disagree, but I can't seem to modify the title. So I added a disclaimer next to the video link on your behalf =))
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:07:42
Thanks all, bitcoinian's idea did the trick. Now I just need to find a good offline Dogecoin Wallet.. Any recommendations would be appriciated?
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:19:31
Can you recommend one? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:00:12

So can you entertain the scenario if it did vanish, or is it a mathematical certainty that it will always be there? I'd just hate to go through the process of creating an offline wallet that can never be brought back online.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:48:09
Yea Coinbase =)) Works like Paypal and no issues buying, selling or transferring bitcoins to cold wallets since I opened my account 6 months ago.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:32:53
At the time I was initiating the refund on the website, one of the screens that came up during the process gave me the option to "enter my return BTC Address, or to use their default BTC Wallet Service" which happen to be Coinbase.
So there was an option, which is just another cool thing about doing business with them.
I choose the Coinbase option because that is my Exchange anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:41:21
Thanks for that strategy... Can you reveal the wallet you use?

Awe man, i totally blew it. I'll have to see if this transaction is retroactive for the cash back, thanks brotha =))

Who ever REALLY knows the future BRO? I'm just speculating...  Like we all are.. But this Artist approach, where artists tip or pay other artists with a digital currency that has value and can be done anonymously and relatively securely, without 3rd party intervention, seems to be the future to me.... BRO!!!! Just avoid financial expectations, and monitor whats happening in the Technology space and you just might come out on top.. Again, Fingers Crossed=))
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:49:36

or $1.00 or $1000.00, that's what i'm talking about.
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:49:05
You are incorrect sir. Both blockchain &amp; BTC matter equally. In the future you won't be able to have one without the other.
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:27:36
thats what i'm talking about.

4 years is indeed just speculation but it's more than enough time for this slow moving adoption rate to have gained momentum. I'd imagine it'll be a lot sooner though. I think there will be no need to cash out because of the deflationary nature built into the Coin.. With transaction volume and wallet downloads on the rise, the demand will go up and the supply will go down. At least based on what I'm seeing.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:25:21
This would be considered an "Off-Chain Transaction."

Just watched  with  about  and so much seemed like ancient history. So many developments since Mt Gox.. Didn't do Bitcoin justice
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:30:23
Agreed!! 60 Minutes does the most comprehensive/ current research of any news program, that's why they've been around 45 years.
Just follow the link, choose 60 Minutes from the drop-down and say you'd like them to do a piece on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:28:19
Totally awesome to have piqued your grandpas interest =))
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:25:13
No. My point is to suggest to 60 Minutes, a piece on Bitcoin, that's all. Their reporting is as classy, fair &amp; comprehensive as it gets. 
Drop them a line and let the cards fall where they may..
That Spurlock "Inside Man" piece was ancient history...
@_date: 2015-03-24 07:19:12
Wow, my first tip, thank you redpistachios!! I will pay it forward to other like minded individuals. Very cool.
