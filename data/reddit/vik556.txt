It’s the same on every exchange, arbitrage everywhere!

Yes of course but throwing 26k is a bit odd, why not 24 then ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:20
You would not cash out every thing in one time, as I would not trust anyone with that amount of money

Download a wallet app, for mobile you have jaxx or breadwallet for example.
For computer you have exodus ( and others).
You will have a bitcoin address and you will need to send your btc to this address.
Remember to note your 12 words key on a piece of paper and don’t loose it
You could also invest in some more secure wallet such as a ledger.

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:08:42
You might have read some books but apparently you didn't get the core principle of bitcoin.
This is the law of supply and demand.
As bitcoin is totally decentralized it is not back up by the fed, BCE... so if the demand drop because of a hack or anything no one will be here to help you.
As the supply is limited and the demand keeps increasing the price is going up
Look at gold, it's expensive because it's rare and hard to find and have a limited supply ( look like bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:24:51
RemindMe! 10 days "950btc"
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:55:48
How did he bought 85btc, I thought every exchange have a limitation.
So he had to wait ( one week) between each transaction ? Isn't it bad, with the fluctuating price ? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:30:18
What do you mean by value? As the value is linked to the demand.
Imagine you are stuck in the desert with 2 friends, you are all thirsty and begging for water, you come across a a man that have a only one bottle of water. 
You first friend agree to buy it for 10$ ( way above market price), but you know you really need it so you pledge 50$ for the bottle of water. 
This is kind of the same stuff happening with BTC limited supply and increasing demand of the asset. 
Even banks are beginning to turn to crypto as they understand the potential of the blockchain. 
Therefore more exposure to media, means more people willing to invest in it, and thus a price increase.
BTC is not just a safe, you can also you this money to buy services, products and even covert it to other crypto or real money . 
This is what support the value of bitcoin .
I hope It's more clear

The safest thing to do right now would be to store your coins on an exchange like coinbase. 
I know this break the number one rule, but they already published statement saying that they will fork the coins and give us access to both of them. 
And as we don’t know which coins will be call btc in the future this might be the safest way
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:37:52
Try nicehash it maximize your mining and you can ask to be pay in bitcoin, therefore supporting the bitcoin community ��

You can use gdax ..
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:55:08
Yes that is what I thought, so financial institutions think bitcoin won’t go lower than 6k over the next year right? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:13:47

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:59:06
You can’t place an order when you don’t have funds on gdax. 
And if you want to avoid fees place a limit order instead of a market one 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:14:02

It depends on your wealth, if you have 200 to invest for example you can buy 50$ every weeks .
But buying large amounts ( like your 700$) can hurt on the short term

Green buyer red seller, x axis represent the value of the bitcoin ( at how much they are willing to sell/buy) . The y axis represent the number of coins available 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:38:04
I think you are missing something, I’m not yet an expert on options, but doesn’t it means that if bitcoin is higher he can exercise his right to buy at 10,000$ until the 28 December 2018. 
Meaning that if bitcoin is worth 11,000$ for example he will only pay 10,000$?

The simplest way to explain limit order would be for a buy order you fix a price when this price is reached you order is fulfilled . 
For a sale order it’s the same
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:18:56
Fees still be an issue, as adoption rise, th number of transactions will rise too.

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:06:37
Yes you place you buy order below the market price, as bitcoin is very volatile you can put an order 0.1cents below and it will clear in a matter of minutes 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:10:27
1.6 trillion dollar in circulation , 21 millions bitcoin, simple division :)! 
But if bitcoin replace dollar it will also replace all the other currencies: 5 trillion 
So like 240,000$/btc

@_date: 2017-11-28 12:13:24
If you want this to happen the fees need to be lower. For now I use BTC to store wealth and ltc to spend it
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:06

@_date: 2017-11-07 14:03:09
Official coinbase statement : 
« Customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to bitcoin on both blockchains. There is no action required from customers and bitcoin can be securely stored on Coinbase before, during, and after the fork.
After the fork, we will enable access when we have determined each blockchain is secure and stable. We expect this to happen within a few days after the fork, but it may take longer if additional risks emerge.
In the coming weeks — nearer to the date of the fork — we will provide a more detailed plan for how Coinbase will approach naming the two Bitcoin blockchains. »
You can leave them on the exchange if you trust them

Yes I totally agree with you but don’t you think that the biggest amount of btc are buy just to make money? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:59:01
Red part are the seller, this represent how many bitcoin are for sale at given prices. 
Green part are the buyer, this represent how many bitcoin could be purchase at a given price
Here we can see that many people want to buy at lower price or many people want to sell at a higher price than the market price .
Hope it is clearer now

No, you should definitely try, how can you know if you will succeed if you don’t try.
But you can try with 100$ the leverage will be small but the % gain-loss will be the same so you will have an idea
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:57:19
Supply and demand, more people want to buy than people that are willing to sale, that drives the prices up!
But the chart analysis is bulls***, all charts analysis are really stupid... everyone can use a ruler to draw lines and make them say what they want
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:53:56
I did some research, and I think I found the an answer. 
Maybe the seller is buying the bitcoin today at 8,000$.
So if the price is 12,000$, the buyer will exercice it’s 10,000$ options, and the buyer will receive the money.
This way the seller have future cash-flow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:45
Continue to buy, they will increase your limit to 10k 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:04:05
I know!! I have the same problem !! 
But if you really think you won’t resist, you can go to gdax and put limit order for free.
They will handle the fork as coinbase as it is the same company 
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:44:55
Yes but to be legitimate it should be use by people right?

Yes that is not a significant increase to talk about China for the moment, this is only an increase of 1.35%.
As Bitcoin is quiet volatile this is not significant enough, but I think we will see the effect on China by the end of the week, or even sooner.
As people need to get register to trade
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:44:38
To avoid paying fees and transfer fees, you should have a look at gdax for example.

Buy now and buy after the new implementation, Bitcoin price is very volatile, we therefore cannot predict what the prices will be, but we can say that Bitcoin took a hit lately because people were afraid that it might split! As far as we know now Bitcoin won't split, and will become more efficient, in a near future, so right now might be a good time to invest, and 4 years ago was also the right time to invest, and maybe in 4 years it will still be the right time to invest
