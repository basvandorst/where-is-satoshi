Two options:
- GBTC (ask your IRA brokerage to hook you up)
- Checkbook IRA LLC (a little complicated to set up but smooth sailing beyond that. Much better than GBTC in the long run.)
In summary: Put the money into GBTC while you set up Checkbook IRA with LLC and open account on an exchange (Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Gemini...). Once the entire infrastructure is in place, cash out GBTC, roll over the IRA to Checkbook IRA, wire the money to the exchange, but BTC, move the bitcoin to cold storage on your own hardware wallet and watch the show.

Why would you hodl privacy coins? You can always cycle into them at the time you actually need the privacy of transaction. Assuming BTC will be the black hole for fiat in the long run, this is an extremely dumb idea. Five years from now the chances of privacy coins going to zero are orders of magnitude higher than bitcoin fizzling out.

Not if you are not in a hurry to move it off the exchange. The reason they cite is a risk of chargebacks by the customer (i.e. telling their bank the transaction was fraudulent and the bank pulling the money back from the exchange). This is quite fair and reasonable although I don't know the exact length of time for the chargeback risk. 
Your fiat money on the exchange is FDIC insured up to $250k and presumably the exchange will make customers whole if it gets hacked (Binance.com did earlier this year when 7000 BTC was stolen from that exchange).

The best btc you'd ever buy is the one where you put buy orders well ahead of time and the purchase is automatic once the price hits your bid. Every exchange allows that with "buy limit" orders.

[How many times has Binance been hacked?](
Binance.US is very new, so the volume is a lot lower than Coinbase. But if you want to limit buy, that should not make a difference. Trading fees are a lot lower than Coinbase. First month trading is free (check if that promotion is still going on). They also have a Black Friday promotion going on, you get 75% discount on trading fees if you hold 5 BNB, 25% otherwise. You also get a $15 sign up bonus. 
Fiat ACH is instant. So it's like a great combo of Coinbase and Coinbase Pro with lower fees than even Coinbase Pro, as long as you are Ok with the lower liquidity. HTH. I am not affiliated with any exchange.

Deflation encourages savings that become the fuel for investment, instead of the fraud that's inflationary growth. Deflation does not mean velocity of money continuously decreasing and eventually reaching zero because investment yields more profits than you gain by just sitting on the money. People are going to keep spending money on everything they need or want, regardless of deflation. You can't postpone the purchase to next week when you gotta feed your baby the formula he needs today. Nobody's going to take a gap year just to pay 0.1% less tuition. It will be stupid to sit on cash instead of owning real assets and securities as well as gaining productive skills, in addition to paying for what you need to live a good life.

That advice applies to someone who's too old to rebuild wealth in case of a major loss. If is younger than 35 or even 40, putting 20% in BTC isn't going to kill his retirement. To play it safer, he can buy, then cash out the pounds he put in once it goes up substantially.

It will cost you approx. $1600 to do, but here's the best way to do it:
- Open a Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) with a custodian that allows you "checkbook control" of IRA funds.
- Create an LLC owned by the SDIRA. You'll be the 100% owner member of this LLC.
- Open a checking account at a bank, in the name of this LLC ("checkbook" of the SDIRA).
- Open a bitcoin exchange account owned by the LLC.
- Move the money from your current IRA into the new SDIRA  and then into the LLC's bank account. The custodian of your SDIRA should help you get this done by wire transfer or check.
- Transfer the money into the crypto exchange account &amp; buy bitcoin.
- Educate yourself about "prohibited transactions" and "UBIT".

Fiat money is super cheap to borrow now and likely even cheaper in the future. If hoarding BTC substantially constricts circulating supply and BTC price rises faster than the interest on fiat loans to miners, the miners could potentially hoard for years and cash out at a much higher price, paying off the loans and keeping the difference.

The blockchain is the decentralized ledger keeping the "central balance." 
With a transaction, bitcoins move from one address to aother, and the transaction is recorded within this ledger. This is the key concept required to understand bitcoin as money.
Private keys are the proof of ownership of a public address and are required to issue transactions from wallets. Whoever has the private key owns the bitcoin.

Hashrate is how many "tries" mining computers are putting in per second in order to get a SHA256 checksum (aka hash) of their candidate blocks wherein the successful checksum is less than the current target value (think of leading zeros in the checksum). 
Think of hashrate as the current "investment" price for buying newly generated bitcoins plus tx fees *for miners*. 
Yes, miners care FAR LESS about LTC in comparison to BTC. Over the long term, if nothing else changes, it means LTC is heading towards zero in comparison to BTC.

If bitcoin sucks up 10% of that amount, it will be $1.45T for 21M BTC. Accounting for lost and yet to be mined BTC, we're talking \~16M BTC.
$1.45T/16M = \~$96,600/BTC
