BTC getting smaller over time. Sucks :(
Edit: why did I get downvoted? Tf
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:45:53
What about that significant drop while other currencies are rising? Just pointing out the obvious.

Water makes things wet. If water comes in contact with my shirt, my shirt is “wet”. In chemistry, we learned that H2O loves bonding with itself. Water comes in contact with water through hydrogen bonds. Water touches water.
Therefore, water coming in contract with other H20 molecules makes it wet. Water makes water wet.

@_date: 2018-08-02 23:49:14
So what I seem to see here are a lot of confused folks. I’m confused, too. Can someone explain to me why we should stick to bitcoin with its current limitations if lightning network doesn’t seem to be as good/fast as BCH? 
I’m really curious. Please don’t ban me for asking an honest question.

I bought at 2K and sold at $5500. Then it went to 20k lol. 
I’ve been watching the boat sink for a while.
It’s amusing. I’ll jump back in when I know it’s time. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:25:24

Hey, gramps. Uh. You need any lawns cut or anything?
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:17:37
I dropped only $200 at 8100. If I lose, oh well.
If it goes up, oh well.
It’s only $200. Yolo
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:50:33
Any projections for the low? I’ve heard 9000, but it’s 8800 now. Hmmmmmm
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:58:53
True. As Lil Wayne says, pussy money weed codeine.  3 left.

@_date: 2018-03-29 12:49:40
Rip. I dropped $200 and already regret it
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:41:48
Do people believe this or do they feel bad for losing tons of money and “believe” it? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:55:20
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:32:02

Nuka, my man
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:51:07
Nice. Nobody cares. Be glad it’s going down so you can buy more.
Again. It’s a meme. Lighten up. You seem fun at parties. :)
“DONT JOKE ABOUT THAT! I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY!!!”
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:29:00
Me when I bought at 2k, sold at 5k, and it sky rocketed to 20k in a month. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:23:05
If you don’t like it, move along, gramps. No need to be such a party-pooper. Sorry you’re losing money. I sold mine after buying at 2k and made a few thousand bucks.  I’m waiting for it to drop more.
Your loss is a win for others. Cya, gramps. ;)
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:23:43
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:30:10
I bought at 6200. Not bad :)
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:45:23
For me it is. I built my own PC from the money I made off bitcoin. It was fun as heck!

HODL. CORRELATION always MEANS CAUSATION!
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:49:09
Because I’m on campus and getting a job now would require me to stay the summer... Whereas in 2 weeks I go home to 20/hour, 60 hour weeks.
I do admit I SHOULD have gotten a job. I made bank last summer, but wasted thousands like a dumb child. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:49:51
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:06:26
Well, I’ve paid my rent and I have food in the fridge. I’m on campus for only 2 weeks until I go home and start making solid money. Idk if $100 is enough for 2 weeks of food and gas.
Also, my dad is always willing to give me money. I hate asking him for it though. Mexican pride thing. 
Also, I’m TOTALLY investing much of my summer money!
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:06:48
The no answered the question I asked. Maybe he should be clearer next time.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:04:04
Yes, hello. May I get a tall Blockaccino with extra block-chain? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:55:44
Everyone wanted to get a lambo off $1000. Not much theory to it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:16:15
Yeah. I flaked this year. Had too much money and didn’t need a job. Next year I’m gonna work at least 20 hours a week. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:59:37
What’s that tho
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:53:44
Probably because many people are losing money.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:09:37
“Nice April fools, guys! Bitcoin is $6500. We can cut the joke and bring it back to $15000 tomorrow. You got me!”
Something like that. lol 
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:21:46
That’s not debatable at all lmao
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:19:04
Free speech wise no
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:25:20
I attend a public US university. I agree. Freedom of speech is trash. Canada is just a big university though.
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:02:12
Lol. You Americans love blaming shit on yourselves, huh? So you’re probably a liberal.
South America is in love with drugs. Mexico is too. Dudes do coke and other shit on the regular. There’s a huge market at home, lol. It’s a problem many Mexicans don’t bring up. 
It’s even harder to solve when people blame it on America. Noice though. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:58:13
This community is too optimistic. It may be because many here have dropped thousands in bitcoin. 
I made like $1400 last year off it. Recently, I invested $200 so idc if it goes to shit or not. I’m enjoying the ride.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:51:22

I just signed up to Bitcoin for cash conversion. Then I realized there’s a huge anti-government atmosphere here lmao. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:21:20
All my Mexican buddies at work ask me what Bitcoin is. I’m scared to talk about it because if they lose money I’ll be the one to blame lol
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:18:21
Question. Why won’t people here like Bitcoin Cash? I’m out of the loop. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:47:36
I need to start charging for sex. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:43:04
I got banned from there for making an April fools joke lol
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:14:29
Hopefully it goes up. I want my $200 to get me a lambo. :3
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:15:45
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:10:25
I have split in bcash and bcoin. I assume getting rid of the bcash is the better option?
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:14:20
So, Venezuelans shouldn’t be allowed to talk bad about their communist government? Let’s ban their “hate speech”, right? When people set rules on hate speech there’s always an agenda. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:00:04
Time to buy that lambo

My name is Tony and I predict $38,382 by April 19, 2021.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:56:48
I have all my bills paid, $100 in the bank, and $500 in Bitcoin. 
$100 to survive two weeks. Starting work, I’ll be making $800-$1200 a week depending on the construction site. I’m not sure if I should cash in the Bitcoin for a little more wiggle room though. I’m afraid it’ll boost.
I sold 0.25 Bitcoin at 6k, and a month later it went to 20k, so I’ve been a bit more skeptical selling my coin since then.
That’s why I’m wondering when the next resistance will be. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:23:32
Same. I hope everyone’s right lasts. Hate speech shouldn’t be banned.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:33:17
I’m a broke college student until May. I put in 200 and have 500 right now. I don’t wanna sell, but idk. I need money for food lol. 
Suggestions? Grind it out? Any solid resistance predictions?
I sold all my bitcoin. Luckily I sold it at the peek for these last 3 weeks (LUCKILY). Now I’m working and making good money. Time to re-invest now that it’s dropping hard again. Thanks for the advice m8s!!
Bitcoin saved my ass in college. Nice story. ��
