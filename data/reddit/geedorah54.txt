Except that’s not what he said nor meant.  If you watch a full speech instead of hand picked clips you see on the news you would know.

They have to deflect because they have no argument.  Just false accusations built on the hysteria propagated by the MSM.
His name was Seth Rich

It was addressed to you.  I’m agreeing with you that the person may be a government shill as you suggested.  When I said “this commenter” I was referring to the person you replied to.  Haha my bad for the confusion however.

It really is sad how people have plunged so deeply into the hysteria that has been propagated by the MSM.
We literally have mountains of evidence of foul play by previous government administrations involving the crimes they are accusing Trump of.  All the facts and evidence of collusion  in the last election point directly at Hillary and the Obama administration with cooperation from prominent Democrats and Republicans.  (Illegal wiretapping on the basis of no evidence/false evidence especially, pay to play government positions etc..)
If you conclude what this commenter has you’re either a blind follower of talking heads, a paid shill or have been completely brainwashed.
