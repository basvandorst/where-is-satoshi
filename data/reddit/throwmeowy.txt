I like it. Go with biometrics for 3FA. A digitized date and signature (of the John Handcock variety) from a {finger,stylus}-to-touchpad would be very similar to current practices. 
Your colored coin app would encrypt those bits (old-school signature, email, and VIN) with the government's private key. Only a link to the encrypted bits would persist on the blockchain.

Okay, let's assume you convinced me. As a citizen of the US, how do I get an account denominated in EUR?

Invest, wait 15 years, then use the bitcoins to buy stuff. In that time, if the price of bitcoins goes up relative to USD, then the stuff is cheaper than it would have been if you had just put the USD under a mattress.

So the trick would be for the manufacturer/dealer to generate and sign the colored coin, which is then transmitted to each subsequent owner of the vehicle. 
Perhaps you split the colored coin upon first sale, one to the government, and another to the buyer. The buyer could split again to many addresses for backups, and would have to demonstrate possession of any one of them to renew registration, sell, etc. Each transmission would link to the VIN and an email address, for 2FA. 
Should the legitimate owner lose possession of the coin, the government could split their copy given possession of the email address. 
A thief of the coin could only take possession if they'd also hacked the email address. Not impossible, but perhaps unlikely enough.
Something like that? Stakeholders would be the manufacturer/dealer, owner, and government. Are the incentives well-aligned?
