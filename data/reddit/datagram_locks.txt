I did the tampering, some corrections:
* This doesn't affect the adhesive. It is still sticky, it is not dissolved.
* The mark at the top is not a needle insertion point, I physically cut the seal with the needle (user error, not a fault of the technique).
* This is just one way of doing this and not an accurate representation of the tamper-evidencing features/security of the seal. A real test will require a lot more than a limited toolkit, 3 bitcoins, and 5 minutes of conference time.
* The person selling the coins (at the conference, not the originator online) complained on Saturday of problems with seal backing gloss or hologram brightness but I didn't agree. He used mighty power of suggestion to encourage this to others. I have no vested interest in bitcoins or whether or not they can be tampered; I just didn't see a difference. The owner of the coins used on Sunday said he couldn't tell any difference between these features on his post-tamper coins.
* The photos shown are from Saturday where I did an older version of the coin (I am told). On Sunday I did the newest (again, I am told) versions of the coin including the 0.5 BTC standard seal and 1 BTC with the weakened ring around the edge.
* It should be easier to do this without a crowd of people standing over you taking pictures.
* I gave myself a 5/10 on all the defeats in terms of how well I tampered them.
* I don't know how bitcoins work but I can answer any questions you might have about tampering : )

Acetone wasn't what was used to lift the seal. We didn't have enough coins to test but I am fairly sure that acetone would not be a viable solvent for this type of attack.
