Noob here - what is input consolidation?
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:26:28
“South Korea bans Crypto bans” somehow that will be shortened to “South Korea bans Crypto” and FUD ensues

Just to confirm I understand: I would not use LN if I was paying someone with whom I planned on only making one transaction. BUT LN will reduce fees overall because major transaction highways (like between Bittrex, GDAX, Kraken, etc) will use LN to make transfers between them meaning less transactions listed on each block thus lowering fees for everyone? If that is correct, I think I understand it all, and I thank you for the information.

To be fair, I knew that my opinion was wrong, but figured Cunningham's law (the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question but to post the wrong answer) would give my search for more info on Lightning Network some help.

That analogy helped a lot thank you!

Have you considered moving them to GDAX then setting a stop loss order at 8K so that the moment the market opens they will sell at market price?

that sucks, sorry man. hope you can dump your Bcash soon. Good luck!

So HODL?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:49:31
So it is like a sidechain that will sync with the main blockchain every few blocks?
EDIT: I'm so sorry, I must sound like a fool. I just am trying to learn more about BTC and Lightning Network but have yet to find a good ELI5 style explanation that makes sense to my small bird-brain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:54:41
how are transaction fees kept low within the Lightning Network? Are there transaction fees in LN? And again, I'm sorry I am asking so many questions. Feel free to stop responding if I get too annoying with it all. I feel like I am missing something that will just make it all click and I will get the concept
EDIT: added a question - sorry
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:02:07
Very helpful thank you

Do you get charged for the initial transfer to the multisig address or just the final transaction after closing the lightning channel? Or to put it a different way, does the multisig address get added to the blockchain upon creation, upon its closure, or at both steps?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:04:38
Dumb question: how does LN lower fees? I think that is the heart of my issue understanding LN

If you’re in the US, I’d suggest using Square’s Cash App. It’s free, but you’ll need a smartphone. There are no fees to buy or sell bitcoin in app, and no fee to move to your wallet. I love it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:09:16
But the beauty of bitcoin is the fee is not linked to the amount of the transaction. You can put $1,000 into a lightning channel for pennies. Then you can do micropayments for dirt cheap!

Sorry for the assholes here. Look into the lightning network. It provides a better experience for your use case. Smaller transactions and smaller fees. All you need to do it open a payment channel and you’re good to go. Think of the blockchain as your savings account and the lightning network as your checking account. Hope that helps clear up some confusion!

If you have a smartphone, I would look into Square’s Cash app and Robinhood. They are both smartphone apps that let you buy and sell bitcoin without fees. I personally buy all my BTC in the Cash app.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:40:27
I use the cash app. Generally speaking their price is on par with Gemini and Coinbase but they don’t add fees on top of it. They let you transfer to personal wallet for free too. Big fan of Square right now
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:55:20
Yes. Cash app sells BTC at a market median price. I assume they buy from whomever has the lowest price and up charge you a percent or something, but no fee per se. I am less familiar with Robinhood as their crypto service isn’t available in my state yet but they claim to be fee-free too.
Edit: did a side by side comparison of Cash app and Coinbase. Coinbase price was $8,230 and Cash app was $8,235. Coinbase would add on a processing fee while Cash app doesn’t. Hope that explains it a bit more.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:35:28
Good to know. I haven’t bought BTC via Robinhood because it’s not allowed in my state yet. I recommended it because I knew it was a reliable app from their other investment options
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:33:56
Thanks for the heads up. I am waiting for Robinhood to open Crypto in my state so my experience with them is very limited. I like their stock options though!
