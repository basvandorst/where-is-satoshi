... Yeah, their entire model is massively more dominating and dangerous than something as trivial as "Facebook credits".

Andreas published "Mastering Ethereum" last year; I think the interview clip is from a while back more than that. He has generally used "Bitcoin" to distinguish I think from the closed "blockchains" that corporations are using poorly for applications that don't need them just to be trendy. Specifically the distributed ledger and the trustless and censorship resistant transfer of tokens, is the key for him. Nowadays he is much less of a Bitcoin maximalist, which was really just a way for him to be consistent and avoid confusion with poor/pointless trendy blockchain implementations.

If you would, allow me to improve your analogy; if money is "information", then bitcoin is "the internet". The internet facilitates the transfer of information with the highest of fidelity over great distances, almost instantly, and incredibly inexpensively compared to previous information transfer mediums (snail mail, long distance phone, books by truck/train). The internet has improved a ton over time, but most of it is still based on good old TCP/IP, the protocol. Money is to information as bitcoin is to the internet. 
And everyone else is right, it is revolutionary in the same way the "internet fad" was.
