Hi guys
I am a crypto-lover from Iran, I believe in the idea of ​​cryptocurrencies. These days, the US government is pushing for new sanctions against my country and nation. Therefore, most of the crypto exchanges like Binance freeze our assets or ban our accounts. Please support the Iranian crypto community for financial freedom, because that is our legal right. We should support each other to advance cryptocurrencies in the future.
