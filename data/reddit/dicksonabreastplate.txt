What do you mean by "investor"?  Do you mean it's illegal for investment banks to buy BTC as part of their portfolio, and if the ETF is approved, they would then be allowed to invest this way?

What is it you dislike about this administration?
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:37:35
Excellent, thanks.

Definitely, but I'd personally never put all my money into one investment. It could cost me upside, but I'll sleep better at night being diversified.

Sounds like a sound investment strategy 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:10:52
That's badass. What exchange allows you to do that?
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:17:29
Please, elaborate.

I use Coinbase, too. Are your purchases manually executed, or does Coinbase have a way to set automatic daily buys? Would you pony me to it? Thanks for your help.

How does that make each BTC worth 1MM?

Hello. Someone had to have seen that flatline on Coinbase from noon to 8pm central time? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:30:45
Perfect

Oh boy. You're begging for some action off that comment. Hahaha

I got paid on Friday
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:00:58
They were probably sushi chefs and not Bitcoin hodlers.

Not sure about y'all, but this seems like a good time to buy. I've been picked up a few coin during the current fall.
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:20:48
Thanks. I'll take a look
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:42:35
Mmmm. I do love a good spreadsheet. Please do.
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:20:35
I just want to brag to friends. No greater purpose. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:24:24

I had 6 BTC and sold out to Ripple a few weeks ago. I could move my Ripple back and have 34 BTC. :T

I've got a TX from May 21 for .19 BTC that is unconfirmed. I used the recommended fee, but no luck.

Jaxx. It was sent to my Jaxx wallet from HitBTC. If anything, I think HitBTC is the issue.
