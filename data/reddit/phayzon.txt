@_date: 2017-12-01 13:05:36
One article suggesting that BCH more closely aligns with the white paper than Core is not the “bcash propaganda machine” that this sub seems to believe. The article itself isn’t even explicitly untrue.

I've been a lurker in both subs for quite some time, and I have to say both sides have gotten a bit ridiculous after the fork.

Megabytes, perhaps? The original blocksize limit was 32MB.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:37:40
Block sizes are variable, with only a maximum limit set. BTC blocks are almost always 1MB because, well, they're full. BCH has a maximum of 8MB, but almost all blocks have been under 1MB because BCH isn't as popular yet.
There are a few blocks in the beginning of BTC's chain that are &gt;1MB, as the original limit was 32MB. This was changed temporarily to avoid DDOS attacks; since there weren't nearly the same amount of nodes and miners as there are today. Unfortunately it never got changed back, which leaves us with the problems we face today.

BCH is 0.7% ahead of BTC in coin count, but they both stop at the same 21 million count anyway. At the current rate, BTC will reach the end in 123 years, BCH will reach it in 122.14 years.
In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter at all, and we'll all be dead long before the 21 millionth coin drops.

“Store of value” and “amazing investment” aren’t  any sort of technological advantages. The same things can be said about Nvidia stock the last year or two.  It just so happens that BTC has a higher value than any other crypto currently. 
LTC also has Segwit, so in theory most of the upcoming developments for BTC will also be compatible with LTC. 
So again, what real advantage does BTC hold over any of the major alts?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:10:47
That *already happened*, if you haven’t been paying attention for the last 7 years. Very early on, it became impossible to mine a whole block on your own (without throwing a ton of money at the problem). This is how pools came to be. You can’t mine a block on your own, but you can get your fair share when you and a bunch of others mine a block together. Block size cap plays no part in that.

That's definitely not unique.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:00:57
It doesn't. Blocks are not a fixed size. Meaning, not every BCH block is 8MB because there simply aren't enough transactions to fill a block repeatedly. By the time blocks *are* regularly full/8MB, storage and network technology will have advanced far enough that everyone will be able to handle it just as well as a full 1MB block today.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:36:08

@_date: 2017-11-22 03:29:18


Yes. What they have *not* given is a measurement between BCH and BTC
 
* 1 BCH = 1 bitcoin
* 1 BTC = 1 bitcoin
* 1 USD = 1 dollar
* 1 CAD = 1 dollar
However, keep in mind that
* 1 BCH != 1 BTC
* 1 USD != 1 CAD
Nor does bitcoin.com claim that to be the case.
It's an unfortunate side effect of the naming scheme, but that doesn't change the reality of the situation.

@_date: 2017-11-20 23:59:16


This is a clear sign that you *didn't even bother to look at the app.*
The 'What's New' says it now creates a BCH wallet by default. What this means is that in prior versions, it *only* created a BTC wallet by default, and you had to manually create a BCH wallet. The app automatically does both now. That's it. That's all it means. This sub is having a massive fucking outrage over something being switching from manual to automatic.

Yes and no. Kind of a necessary evil as the unit of measure is expressed as 'bitcoin'. 
Real money has the same issue. You could ask to borrow 5 dollars from someone, and get CAD when you expected USD. Both are dollars in the same way that both BTC and BCH are bitcoins.

In regards to point 3, my understanding is completely different.
Let's say you have a bus stop [mempool] with a bunch of people waiting to get picked up by the bus [unconfirmed tx]. Every 10 minutes a bus [block] will stop and pick up say 100 people. Well what if you get a bigger bus, say one that fits 200, and it still arrives every 10 minutes, don't all the people get picked up and on their way faster?
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:01:48
I suppose the missing piece of the puzzle to me is, where is this hypothetical bus *going* that it's getting stuck in traffic? What is actually slowing down the bigger bus with more people on it?
Didn't the Cash chain have a single block with something like 40 thousand transactions in it? I'm just not grasping how that can possibly be *less* efficient than sending 40 1000-man buses at equal intervals.

You joke, but I'd be somewhat interested in seeing a crypto that fits this bill. Battery life (and data caps) be damned, every phone could be a full mining node.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:33:25
Not exactly. Segwit blocks are measured by block weight, not block size. A block full of nothing but SW transactions will "weigh" 4MB. But without any SW transactions a block can still only be 1MB. Segwit2X increases the base size to 2MB, and therefor the SW weight to 8MB. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:00:15
So if all the ASIC miners move to BCH/S2X, how are all these non-mining nodes going to process transactions at the ridiculously high difficulty that BTC is currently at?
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:53:45
For being so "irrelevant" you guys really can't stop talking about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:36:26
I'm interested in knowing how you think your transactions will get processed if there are no miners.

So let me get this straight... This breaks LN, a thing that doesn't even exist yet, on a chain that won't even exist by next year?
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:24:48
Fair enough. Same reason the other sub talks about this one all the time.

If I sell my BTC right now I’ll certainly get more than a dime.

There have been several points in history where BTC has fallen 30-90%. Falling 25% isn’t exactly great, but it’s not the end of the world either.

Aside from like 3 dudes shooting the shit together at a local bar, pretty much every collection of people in one way or another has a leader.

What arbitrary value would you like me to assign to a few days or so of idle computer time in mid 2010? Already had the CPU, didn’t have to pay for electricity. $0 investment, and now these magic bits of internet data inside a small file on my hard drive are worth thousands.

I don't get the "rushed and untested" argument, especially when many also spout off that Garzik "just copy and pasted Core's code and changed a 1 to a 2!"
So... is core's code rushed and untested then since it's basically the same?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:32:47
If we pretend hard enough that non-mining nodes matter, maybe we can stop 2x!

This sounds like a significantly more pressing issue than any of this blocksize nonsense. Why does no one ever mention anything about FIBRE here, if it's so important?
And what about all the significantly-larger-than-300k (many even tickling 1MB) blocks that existed *before* FIBRE was implemented in Core?

Core's rules are the textbook definition of legacy. There are undeniably newer rule sets out there, but they have not replaced Core due to it's widespread adoption.

The primary danger of a hard fork (of any crypto) is that both forks may *survive*. No replay protection on either fork ensures that a winner emerges relatively quickly.
We don't need a million slightly tweaked flavors of Bitcoin floating around. I'd argue that the two we have now are too many, but thanks to BCH's replay protection we'll have both forever.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:04:06
There’s been several admissions the past few months in this sub of people doing exactly the same thing with core nodes. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:27:46
Core has yet to implement it either.
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:55:06


Thank you for *specifically not helping the network*. BTC1 blocks/transactions currently comply with all of Core's rules, since a chain split has not occurred.
With all the things people call an "attack", I have no idea how this shit gets a pass. Sure, deny their blocks after the split when their off doing their own thing. Pre-split it's just a dick move.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:14:56
So only Core is allowed to change Bitcoin?

"Slightly above $4400 for like an hour this morning before dipping back to the $4300s" is now "Surging above $4400"?
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:42:49
They know, and they're surprisingly not even worried about it. It's not like here where when BTC falls $100 we jump to DEFCON 3.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:47:07
It is obviously cylindrical.
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:49:02
Keep in mind that BTC1 nodes can be disguised as Core nodes, since Core in their infinite wisdom decided to start blocking transactions *before* a chain split...

If someone, somewhere still has a pre-Value Overflow copy of the chain, then yes.

@_date: 2017-10-02 22:46:57
You're right, I should've said "a few hours". Nonetheless, it "surged" from 4380 to 4460, and now we're back at at 4360.
"Climbs above 4400" would've been a bit better, of if it *actually* surged to $5k would be even better!

You can fit about 3 copies of the entire chain on a $30 hard drive. If that makes or breaks whether you run a full node, then running a full node isn't for you.

Original Bitcoin had 32MB blocks and no SegWit. By your logic, what we have now also isn't Bitcoin even though we're still calling it that.
