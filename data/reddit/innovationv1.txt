Newegg. You will need to use a wallett that is compatipable with bitpay (their payment system) bitcoin core desktop wallet works good. Or you can check their website for compatible walletts before buying anything.

I only know a couple of sites that you input your electric costs, hashrate, and the coin you are mining. It tells you your daily return on the coin so you can mess around and see what the returns would be

So you’re safe when you withdraw the funds to a address you own and not using their address to a gambling address?
Because I’m assuming it would be flawed if you sold your bitcoins to another person and they gambled leading to your account being banned.

When things are locked at say, .00045 bitcoin in a shop you know you are paying that amount and will always pay that amount no matter the price change of bitcoin itself. Prevents people from double guessing their purchase using bitcoin not knowing what the price will be tomorrow but that they are paying x amount for this item and it will always be x amount.

It was great. Work has a thankgiving dinner and one of the managers knew I am investing into bitcoin and told a different store manager. So the other store manager was there and asked me out of nowhere if I invest. Told him yeah I invest into bitcoin and he said he does as well. Pretty cool he told me just a couple days before the dinner that he bought 70 litecoins. Which I think were at $68-72 at the time so he has already made a lot of money. He was talking about bitconnect but I told him not too because he is still recently getting into this type of stuff. From what I am aware bitconnect is a ponzi and told him to steer clear. I may be wrong if someone would like to correct me. Had the chance to explain to other coworkers there about bitcoin they did seem interested though.

Nicehash could do that for you in the settings of the miner to only mine when the computer is idle. Although I wouldn’t reccomend it since it lowers your gpu and cpu lifecycle by a lot.

I have told all of them that there is always going to be price changes and that the next day it could be a thousand dollars less than it was the last. I made it very clear that you could potentially lose and or make a lot of money.

I reccomended Coinbase, and Gdax. Credit card and bank transfer to get the price lock over coinbase when buying with bank transfers.
Maybe even VIRWOX if you would not like to wait for verification and have a verified paypal account to buy with.

Download bitcoin core. Let it sync with the network, then open bitcoin core using the desired wallet.dat file.
Gl and I hope you just found thousands!

@_date: 2017-10-23 17:14:53
Okay. Get your coins off the exchange as soon as you can or want to. Set up a temporary wallet you can find on the appstore I am using blockchain but breadwallet works great as well from what I know.
If you really want to set up bitcoin core on your pc. Let it sync up with the network (which will take a while depending on network speeds” and you have your own wallet on what i’m assuming is a really secure pc. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:44:15
Lmao you’re retarded if you think bitcoin is the culprit.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:18:28

@_date: 2017-10-28 01:08:27
I did some minjng back in 2014 didn’t get much bitcoin since it was one of those usb miners. Remembered about the btc recently and it was like 3 cents back then now it’s around $8-9. Just doing some cloud mining at the moment untill I can get my hands on a asic miner.

I would only use breadwallet for temporary storage untill you can get your own private storage set up, such as a paperwallet or a usb drive such as a trezor if you wanted
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:51:35
Paper wallet?

I remember back when bitcoin was $400 a coin and I  tried to invest but didn’t have money. I’m still salty about it all. Now here I am in 2017 starting to get back into it and started mining.
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:50:02
Yep, scammed.

I curently have around $500 invested in cloud mining with a couple of friends that I have *almost* convinced that they should also invest in btc mining such as myself. So far my weekly return is around $35 in btc current rate. Only going up more with the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:12:35
Nice man. Good hold.

No lol the stock market dropped 1000 points yesterday and bitcoin was still on the rise at the moment. Doubt it will.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:23:53
I would say yes if you are looking for a profit in the long run.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:59:29

@_date: 2017-10-28 03:14:56
Using someone elses hardware to mine in a pool for me. I get to choose the pool I want to mine in and I get paid out every night for a certain amount of bitcoins depending on how many blocks found and mining power I contributed with. From 3.53 T/H I am making $4.30 back a day.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:18:10

@_date: 2017-10-27 19:49:02
Won’t regret.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:01:00
Ehh ATM’s usually charge a lot more than what the btc is actually selling for.
Say the price for 1 BTC is $6000 they’ll charge you around $7200 per bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:54:34
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:51:38
What are you mining with lol?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:07:41
I’m not too sure if there is any other way to contribute by running the node.

@_date: 2017-10-28 04:20:31
Understand what you’re talking about. I did plenty of research before actually spending my money on some mining.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:24:04

First of all, you can’t really “invest” in bitcoin. You can speculate with bitcoin that you think you will be able to make money.

r/btc is such a shill for bcash, you legitametly cannot have a normal conversation over Bitcoin without getting bashed that the fork bcash is superior... when without Bitcoin you would not have your alt coin bcash to shill over.
