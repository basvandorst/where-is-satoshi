I've accumulated what I'm happy with now, I'd like more but can't justify it, averaging a 10k BTC I'm ready to moon. Anything else will now go into stocks and shares to save away and eventually buy a bungalow.
Here's hoping BTC will allow me to slash my mortgage in half in a few years

Nothing, all I have is access to localbitcoin which I was hoping would help paper trail.

I must recommend the Ledger Nano S, finally secured my assets and it was really easy to set up.
My opinion is worth shit (I know), but I am very satisfied when I step back and look over the the past week.
The big rise and fall just appears as volatility. Overall, we have made a steady gain. I hope to invest more in a couple months once I am settled into my new house.
Onward and upwards.

I guess you could say I had more pressing issues at the time.  
Now, having recent moved out, I am trying to sort out my retirement plan.

What app do people use for a quick check of the price? Coinbase keeps reporting a different figure at a top of the page to what's on the hour/daily chart. Been doing this for a week or so and ones 8200 whilst the other is 8500
