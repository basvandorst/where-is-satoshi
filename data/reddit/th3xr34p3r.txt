2. Trezor Support - same as double encryption except now they will need physical access to my hardware signing wallet.
3. My wallet is not stored on any mobile or desktop device but I always have access it.
4. I have the option to login via the site or when down use the browser plugin with full features as the online version as an offline wallet.
5. Multiple Backup options.

Step 1 – Download bitaddress.org
You will want to use the web app provided by bitaddress.org to generate a new wallet address and private key, but using the site on a computer online would open you up to all the same vulnerabilities as hot storage, potentially. To try and secure the process better, go to  and save the website by going to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Save Page As…’ and selecting ‘Web Page, complete’ then clicking ‘Save’ on the dialogue box.
Step 2 – Load bitaddress.org Offline
For the most secure cold storage, you will want to load the copy of bitaddress.org that you saved on a computer that has interacted with the internet as minimally as possible.
A good suggestion is to download a Linux Live CD/DVD and boot your machine off of that, but if this seems too much, you may simply disconnect your computer from the internet, scan for malware and viruses, and then load your offline copy of bitaddress.org.
Step 3 – Getting Some Randomness
For generating your cold storage Bitcoin wallet address and private key, you will need a source of randomness. You may wish to use some dice, playing cards, coins, or anything else you can think of that will give you some random source of information.
This tutorial suggests using dice for generating random numbers. You will want to roll the die or dice and record a 62 number sequence of the roll results. These 62 rolls will ensure you exceed the amount of entropy (randomness) that Bitcoin utilizes with its 256-bit encryption algorithms. You may record a longer sequence of random numbers if you wish, but this is not necessary.
Step 4 – Generate A Brain Wallet
In the window with bitaddress.org running offline, click the Brain Wallet tab and enter your string of random numbers into the passphrase input box. Click the ‘View’ button, and the client-side web app will generate your cold storage Bitcoin address and private key.
Write down the address and private key by hand. If you choose to print it out, remember that your printer represents a potential security hole in this process. Use something offline if you must.
For redundancy, you may wish to copy the wallet’s private key and paste it into the text box under the ‘Wallet Details’ tab and click ‘View Details.’ This will show your cold storage wallet address, public key, and private key in various formats both compressed and uncompressed. Keep any or all of these for redundancy using the same methods you used to record the original wallet address and private key.
Step 5 – Load Your Cold Storage Wallet
To load bitcoins onto your new cold storage wallet, simply access the wallet containing the bitcoins you wish to keep long-term and send any you wish to the wallet address of your cold storage (written down in Step 4 above).
You may add coins to the cold storage wallet as often or as infrequently as you like. Sending bitcoins to the cold storage wallet does not create any holes for attackers to steal coins from your long-term holding.
View Balance of Cold Storage Wallets
To view the balance of your cold storage wallet at any time, or to confirm receipt of bitcoins you have sent to store offline, simply access  where COLD_STORAGE_ADDRESS is replaced by the address of your cold storage wallet or add the public address as a Watch only address in your wallet for quick glancing. This will display all transaction history and current balance contained on the wallet.
Spending Cold Stored Bitcoins
To spend bitcoins kept long-term in cold storage wallets, you will need to import the private key of the cold storage wallet into a hot storage wallet. This can be done simply on blockchain.info under the ‘Import/Export’ tab on the wallet page. Note: This will import your cold storage bitcoins for use on a hot storage wallet and thus opens up all the potential security risks that come with any hot storage wallet hence why once you sweep the private key you need a new cold storage wallet to send to for future storage.
This is one of the best reccomended solutions until more Hardware wallets are made avaliable to add a physical signing layer to your hot wallet of choice, but in the case of blockchain.info you can enable double encryption (a second password only you will know before a transaction is made) in the mean time.

A physical merchant does not have to wait for the first confirmation to accept the payment as they have instore surveillance of the purchase as proof if a double spend occurs (which when using a proper wallet is less likely to occur due to the time and costs involved), It is only with large Asset based transactions that both parties will have the time to wait for at least 1 confirmation to occur whilst the paper work is completed.
Edit: forgot to mention from what I read of the atomic cross-chain use case earlier it could help mitigate double spends on 0 confirm tx's further if implemented wallet side proper.

hence why I said: just a matter of time and momentum. 
Once Bitcoin ATM's are more prevalent and more online and brick and mortar shops (on top of the ones that already do) accept bitcoin then using cash or fiat will be left to government related services and tax's that refuse to create a gov/fedcoin for their own uses.
For places/people that don't have the option of smart phones there are and will be improved options to use the sms based system with a coinkite like POS terminal using their cards that's already in place to take advantage of the infrastructure in that part of the world until such a time as they are ready/able to upgrade.
Cash to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to Cash will be the main three ways to move funds/make trade for products and services once the FinCen/Fisa crap has settled and is put behind us since all they are doing is trying to stagnate the flow into Bitcoin at any and all endpoints that they can touch (including those in other countries with their like minded parties).

With Bitcoin you can send/receive payments without a middleman taking the cut and get the full funds to where they are needed the most and as we are in the beta adoption phase we are setting up the main infrastructure in places where their fiat is at or in a tipping point to hyperinflation first.

Those are the main ones I use in all my Firefox installs as for AV I use [McAfee Total Protection]( (just bought out by Intel so will be renamed to Intel security suite or some such).
As for Blockchain.info - Lastpass + Double Encryption till you get a hardware wallet like trezor for physical signing and disable email/cloud backups only do local manual backups to a USB or two periodically.
with 2fa/multifactor keep offline backups of the QR codes that you scan as you add keys so that you can add them to a new 2fa/multifactor device if you loose the old one or it gets destroyed (as such you can also use Titanium backup if you are on an android device to keep encrypted backups of the apps with the data or just the data as you add new keys and move that backup to you offline storage)
As for Hardware and Operating systems that's down to your preference and use case.

Preev used to include gox in their average price calculations when converting BTC to your chosen currency, since the issue with them began they disabled gox as an enabled option by default when weighing the price average across the supported exchanges.
Most people would take the highest average price then add say 1-2% for profits to use to buy more coins then repeat the process, as gox is declining in price and not adding overall price value in their calculations people just do not include them anymore whilst the withdrawals are locked of both fiat and bitcoin.

Also a hosted wallet service like localbitcoins, blockchain, coinbase or coinkite will not/or ever shall ask for you to transfer funds to an address you do not have control of, this is why they have a policy and warning on sign up that any access lost to the wallets is not under their control and as I have stated in another post keep your main funds stored offline and in an encryped form in multiple secure locations that only you and a select trust have access to.

This has triggered my cryptolocker alarm.. most users will not see it as wallet.dat.exe as by default the OS is set to show only the filename and not the type. e.g. when they got users to download a zip that was actually an exe with a long name to hide the exe portion and icon set to a zip folder.

That type of reasoning is why we have bad password database management. Get in the habit of demanding your programs securely store your login credentials. I'm sick of seeing these excuses.

Same can be said about services like paypal or visa and mastercard, you are placing trust in a third party with all your details on a pull based payment system.
With Bitcoin you do not have to use the exchanges yourself and you do not need share all you details other than a single address you want to set as a public receiving address where ever you want.
In regards to purchases  is just one of many aswell as  until its natively supported.
You also have  to see if and where there is a Bitcoin ATM available locally.
The best way to make progress to that day where it is in everyday life is to go to the places you go to regularly and ask and/or help them setup if they are willing to look into integration.

The underlying message for the mainstream users is to just sign up with coinbase, blockchain, kipochi, or other wallet were you don't need the merchant options and just start using it instead of needing to fuss about all the technical aspects unless you are interested in learning about those aspects.

It is currently the norm to include a fee of 0.0001 to 0.0005 or none depending on your client. you might not have enough in your wallet to send out your current funds plus the default fee set in your wallet client aswell the minimum value accepted by default is set at somewhere around 5400 satoshi to combat dust transactions.

The Dust filter was setup to help prevent gambling sites like SatoshiDice from spamming the blockchain with too small transactions and instead using a single input multiple output method once the minimum was reached.
Having it changed to a softcoded system will just make it easier for the end users to send their funds without the need to calculate the fee ontop and instead allow them to tell the miners how long they are willing to wait for a certain number of confirmations.

This is why you only add funds you intend to spend with these services and securely store savings funds in an encrypted backup wallet where you require at least 2 points of verification before any funds are withdrawn. i.e. Blockchain (as you can use the browser plugin to use the wallet offline) and major offline wallets will have support for the trezor to allow MFA on a per transaction level.

If you are not willing to help keep your friends and family safe by having open talks with them beforehand without understanding that its the choices people make and not the services/tools that are at fault then you have no right in taking it up with a higher power.
Asking for bank transfers to be stopped to those that use Bitcoin will not do anything but help further people into using more local person to person exchanges and faster adoption of Bitcoin ATM's via cash transactions to get around the banks policies.

edit (04/03/14) got the following reply this this morning:
The status is as following:
As we have announced previously via our newsletter, facebook and twitter, we experienced more problems with the hardware production that brought us basically back to the beginning of the process. 
At the moment the Metallics are done but the Classics still not. We are negotiating with a new producer, because the previous one has totally failed our expectations.
We feel very sorry for this situation because we don't want to disappoint our early supporters and this situation is putting the entire project into a bad light. We are literally working day and night and hope for your kind understanding and patience.
You can find more detailed information about the status of the software and the hardware at our FB pages 
Once we have a clear view on the deadlines, we will send a newsletter to the subscribers. For the moment we could just roughly estimate.

Blockchain.info does not store your keys or wallet password that is all done on the client side and managed by the user, this is why there is a statement when you sign up that password and wallet recovery is not possible through Blockchain.info if said access is lost and is why we continually recommend users to keep multiple backups and cold storage backups of their wallet keys.
On top of which I also recommend users to use lastpass or keepass to manage their logins more effectively. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:49:56
I'm assuming you got infected with a keylogger so I'm going to quote myself here:
First step is to not get infected in the first place:
* [Noscript](
* [BetterPrivacy](
* [Dr.Web LinkChecker](
* [HTTPS-Everywhere](
* [Web of Trust](
* [Historyblock](
* [PrivacyChoice TrackerBlock](
* [Adblock plus](
* [Ghostry](
* [Lastpass]( - mainly to keep your passwords secured from botnets and such that like to get data via the cache and key-logging and for management of your accounts/wallets.
Those are the main ones I use in all my Firefox installs as for AV I use [McAfee Total Protection]( (just bought out by Intel so will be renamed to Intel security suite or some such).
As for Blockchain.info - Lastpass + Double Encryption till you get a hardware wallet like trezor for physical signing and disable email/cloud backups only do local manual backups to a USB or two periodically.

The scarcity comes from the mining of the coins, the fact that yes you can move the decimal place if so needed beyond the current 10^8th place is not an issue.
Until then we move the decimal place as stated for psychological reasons as the price per single coin asset increases based on market price vs what ever local currency the user is exchanging at the time.
Same way as when making purchases with cash and getting exact change or change in cash plus physical coins.

1. Double Encryption - even if the login + 2fa is bypassed they need my second pass to steal my coins.
2. Trezor Support - same as double encryption except now they will need physical access to my hardware signing wallet.
3. My wallet is not stored on any mobile or desktop device but I always have access it. (other then them having the ability to backup encrypted copies server side they do not and cannot unencrypt those backups all encryption and decryption is done client-side)
4. I have the option to login via the site or when down use the browser plugin with full features as the online version as an offline wallet.

There is no transaction ID in the Bitcoin protocol but a transaction Hash. To make it more clear you need to understand that a transaction has an input and an output.
* The input is composed of the hash of the previous transaction and the signature script that will prove you are the owner of the coins. As you can note there is no input amount because the entire provision of the address will be spend. The change will be send back to you in the transaction output.
* The output is composed of an amount and a signature script. In this case the signature script gives the condition that needs to be filled to unlock the coins.

A new CoinJar Filler user will automatically get A$500 daily limit upon confirmation (using mobile phone). This daily limit will remain unchanged for the first 7 days after the first deposit notification is approved. After that, the daily limit will automatically increase to A$2,000.
Each subsequent approved deposit will increase the limit by A$200 until the maximum daily limit of A$10,000 is reached.
As for selling:
The maximum for selling bitcoin is $5,000 per user per order. You can place as many orders as you like.
However, in order to guarantee a high quality of service, there is a global maximum (the total limit on the website) of A$45,000 a day. This is to ensure we can quickly settle all payments at the end of each day. If you plan to buy or sell a extraordinarily large amount of Bitcoin, feel free to create a ticket or email us and we will try to arrange a counter-party for you efficiently.
Forgot they changed it to $200 since I signed up at the $100 phase, but thats from the limits section of the Filler and the knowledgebase.

* [Dr.Web LinkChecker](
* [HTTPS-Everywhere](
* [Web of Trust](
* [Historyblock](
* [PrivacyChoice TrackerBlock](
* [Adblock plus](
* [Ghostry](
* [Lastpass]( - mainly to keep your passwords secured from botnets and such that like to get data via the cache and key-logging and for management of your accounts/wallets.
Those are the main ones I use in all my Firefox installs as for AV I use [McAfee Total Protection]( (just bought out by Intel so will be renamed to Intel security suite or some such).

This is why you have at least offline one physically secured unencrypted backup and multiple encrypted backups and as such is why I'll be adding the extra layer of my Trezor when it arrives as that requires as I said physical access to it in order to sign and send the funds out ontop of the password.
Overkill for the average user but I prefer to do it right than be lazy and not.
Lastpass / Keepass + Trezor + Plugin (when needed) + Double encryption + backups of your authenticators and wallets that only you have access to + the multiple encrypted versions in multiple locations you trust is imo the more secure way to go

Once the payment has been sent to the address it shows up in the wallet, as in a local scenario you are physically visiting the store they are willing to take the risk on a double spend once they see it hit their wallet.

Bitcoins do not resemble the currency of the US or of any other nation in any way, shape, or form. The word "dollar" is not attached to them in any way. The "$" symbol is not used in any way.
Bitcoins have no representational similarity whatsoever to the US dollar or of any other nation currency. 
All previous centrally managed private money were prosecuted under counterfeiting laws because they allegedly resembled US or other nation currency of the country/state they were produced and managed from.
The decentralized Bitcoin, with no leader, no servers, no office, and no tangible asset backing, does not have the same vulnerability.

Lastpass / Keepass with multifactor auth (even if you can only do 2fa you can mitigate that by using a layered system to restrict access further) and your master pass on all your accounts and keys backed up, use virtual keyboards when possible, keep physical backups of your most important addresses (i.e 3 of 5 physical keys needed to retrieve the funds that need to be physically retrieved from multiple locations).
It may be a little extreme but it's better to do it right from the start then not at all or half ass the security for your most important accounts and data.

Why should anyone use centralized derivative debt based on IOUs that have no benefit to the working class and only benefit those at the top of the pyramid in order to control the masses?
As for the security lets see.. 
1. MFA on both the transaction an login solves this and unless you are daytrading you store your funds in a secure wallet that you have control of with the private and public keys and not in a hotwallet when it comes to large sums. i.e blockchain + trezor, paper wallets printed and stored in multiple fireproof safes etc.
2. Banks and ATM's have been robbed and hacked (look up Sandworm Team aswell as the mass ATM theft in NY a few months ago) multiple times and as such you ARE better off moving your funds to a bitcoin wallet as stated in 1.
3. As with ANY service it is the responsibility of the user to see fit to how secure they are and do research into any and all current and new services they look into using. Lazy and Poor security practices breeds higher risk of hacks and theft.
Lastly Banks are already bankrupt and have been since the crash of 2008, this is why the interest rates have been as low as 0.0001% since then ontop of the endless QE (printing of money) that has been given to all the banks even those that did not need it as a cover up to keep the true zombie banks from being known.
This printing of money is why your US national Debt is so high ontop of why your "real" money's  devaluation is on the increase every month.
So I ask again:
Why should anyone use centralized derivative debt based on IOUs that have no benefit to the working class and only benefit those at the top of the pyramid in order to control the masses?

erm, my phones av lets me do the following:
1. Camera Trap on multiple failed attempts for unlocking the phone
2. locking down the phone further if the sim is removed and ability to use text message commands to find the phone via maps and sound an alarm on it via the anti theft password.
Either way the only way for them to get at my phone is physically and to even use it will risk a wipe remotely or if they do a hard reset.
Even then I do not take my sight of my phone, or let people near me enough when I go out.

The last time I used cash was when it was given to me, everything is paypass, paypal or bitcoin for me these days.
This was expected to happen sooner or later and they will be slowly phasing out ALL denominations in due time, I mean hell we barely even use shrapnel (coins) anymore.
All this means is people should not be investing in cash but actual physical goods these days that can be traded in ANY value at the time of sale ie a goods for goods economy.

There is  for an LTC e-wallet and  for both BTC and LTC (latter only just heard off so need to have a look at how it works), I would send funds to the offline wallet first since you have more control and only send finds to the online wallet in small amounts whilst it is in beta and same goes to the exchanges don't send too much funds to each so that you don't loose too much if they go down in the future.
I have not played around with LTC as yet but I will see what I can do to make a similar flowchart based on current options when I have the time. 
Also with anything online make sure if they have the options for two factor authentication for withdraws and logins then enable them, yes it may be annoying to have to enter as rand number everytime but in the long run you will be safer then without and never use the same email (if you have multiple emails) or passwords (even if they get your email having no two identical accounts dampens the risk that all get compromised), for the latter use lastpass and remember your master password.

1) yes you are sending it via their chosen public address they want to receive those funds to.
2) The private key is used to generate any future public keys and all currently generated public keys tied to that private key are automatically linked from when the wallet was first created.

Bitcoins are divisible (1btc = 100000000 satoshi or 0.000000001 when viewed in a wallet client) so you can start with the minimum that your exchange allows to purchase. You don't need to buy entire lots in one big dive. Just buy as much or as little as you can afford at the time.

You only need a pgp key to encrypt or decrypt signed messages in emails or files (i.e. if you decide to use pgpcrypt to encrypt your wallet.dat or wallet.json file for backup to multiple physical tamper-proof locations), Bitcoins only rely on  public address(s) to public address(s) to send and receive.

Electrum provides mnemonic code in order to represent the seed so that you can regenerate the wallet at any point after you remove it from the system as long as you have that code.

Coinbase instant BTC feature for funding the wallet is a more internal system from what I have been reading as it takes a few hours to register in the blockchain for services like bitpay, so imo its best as a business wallet.
Blockchain.info is great as a simple everyday wallet for keeping $100 - $200 worth of bitcoins, where as for offline cold strorage there is imo the best one: Electrum with the native android version in the works and both the android and desktop version able to be synced with the ability to include litecoin support in the works there is no better for my uses esp with not needing to store the blockchain on the system but is referenced via the nodes you connect to aswell as support for the Trezor hardware wallet for added physical security to prevent funds being moved/spent without your confirmation.
I use all three based on what I need to do at the time. e.g.

Exactly this is more about keeping a balance, the occasional meme is fine, but spamming the same one is where it needs to be stopped. The same applies to not just meme's but other posts in general, a repeat say after a day if its not at the top already for those that missed it is fine but within an hour is not what we want here.
As for trolling, I'm all for a good troll every so often but when it starts going overboard that's when I put my foot down to settle things down where/when I can.

All they can do is try limit the conversion points (which is why they want AML/KYC and MSB fees paid in the millions even well before a company has a chance to properly get running to make enough for each state and then at the federal level they want to setup in), at that point by the time the manage to do so, we all would be staying within the Bitcoin system way before then.
They can change it all they like, all they care about is forcing to keep people locked into their system and bail in their banks from peoples accounts via aggressive tactics to force people into greater cyclical debt (point's to Cyprus as the test), the more people that choose not to use the banking system as it currently stands the less power they have on those people.
Bitcoin at its heart is a decentralized payment protocol that has been let of the leash, the currency/money aspect is a bonus benifit to give incentive to the miners to secure it even if no one is mining in the US or China.

You pay for a $100 card with bitcoin with a value of $100 at the time of purchase and get 3 points per $1 spent using bitcoin so in this case its 300 points to use on your next gift card purchase and for this you would get an extra 100 points; every 100 points = $1 off your next giftcard.

The transaction fee is only needed for escrow based transactions with the default minimum set at 0.00001 BTC (as of now to eliminate dust transactions from cluttering the chain, will be adjusted as the need arises for smaller transactions for regular payments), you can opt out of the miners fee if you are not concerned with a quick confirmation time for other transactions.

Electrum use it to manage your offline wallet as stated, then use blockchain or coinbase as a hot wallet for day to day transactions (do not import any keys just add them as contacts to send to them when you want to send some bitcoins to you savings wallet), use bitcare on your android phone if you use one and just add the address you want to keep any eye on/watch for balance tracking. done.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:18:00
Yes, keeping multiple backups regularly updated is a safe way to go, if you do not wish to redownload the blockchain you can use Electrum instead for your savings wallet and keep a hot wallet for actual spending with Coinbase or Blockchain.info on your tablet or mobile device.

 That is a flow chart I posted in another subreddit, might come in handy for your planning stage for your BTC wallets.
I'm in the process of making a similar one for LTC as reliable options become available.
1) When it comes to mining coins right now if you can would be the opportune time to get into asic mining rather than gpu/cpu mining for BTC, whilst for LTC cpu/gpu is still a valid path due to the lower difficulty rate.
2) Best place to buy BTC will be based on your location and withdraw options, keep this page:  bookmarked as it will allow you to check the status of the exchanges, communities and wallets aswell as the tools you can use. (don't forget to label each address you intend to use as you create them for their purpose to make it easier to track them, and if using multiple wallets but would like to keep an eye on them in a single app look into Bitcoin Wallet Balance if you are on android: 
In terms of use for online wallets:
Blockchain/StrongCoin is best for personal BTC, Coinbase can be used as private/public doantions, bips for a bussiness wallet.
But no matter what online wallet you choose always have an offline wallet to backup your personal payments to and another for business payments if they are not to be converted on the exchange on each transaction.

* Currency: a system of money in general use in a particular country.
"the dollar was a strong currency"
synonyms:	money, legal tender, medium of exchange, cash, banknotes, notes, paper money, coins, coinage
* Money: a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes; coins and banknotes collectively.
"I counted the money before putting it in my wallet"
By logic Bitcoin is both currency and money, it is traded as a currency on the exchanges on the markets and it is used as medium of exchange for items of value.
Gold is a currency because it is not practical to be used for everyday exchanges but is traded on the global markets.

It is recommended you have a verified paypal account before you go this route but of the options I found this to be the most convenient and fastest (until the BitcoinATM's are setup for local and quicker fiat to crypto-currency conversion).
As with all purchases and transactions use at you own risk.

I used the 1.7.3 electrum android client for a while and when they upgraded the desktop client to 1.7.4 the android one stopped syncing properly and or not at all in my case, if you can get both the desktop and android versions to sync up and talk to eachother properly I might start using them again.
Also hope electrum will support altcoins as needed more so LTC then NMC etc ontop of BTC as a proper user friendly and secure (as far as the user capabilities go) wallet for people to use, this would be a huge step in making cryptocurrencies that much more a viable option for people. eg.. multiple wallets but a single client that can read them.

No each private key is never shared out and till heuristic wallets are more common you gen get one private key per wallet; you will only see the public key when sending and receiving funds. Think of the public key as a contact address and the private key is your security access to spend the coins in your wallet that only you have access to which is encoded into the wallet and only the bitcoin client sees. If that private key is compromised then you need to move the funds into a wallet that has not been compromised.
Most bitcoin clients have an option to add known public keys to an address book with labels that you send funds to regularly so you don't need to rescan the qrCode every time and same goes to your receiving address(s) that you create as you need them to better track what public key is used for what receiving transaction for that wallet.

With slush and other pools you connect to them and mine for a share of the pools reward, with cex.io you buy shares in the pools hashing power and can connect your miners to it, in both cases you are mining and withdrawing to your own address but with cex.io you can have multiple shareholder address to withdraw to once you hit the minimum.
So in this ruling as long as you can prove that the shareholder address's belong to you, i.e. 1% back into cex, 50% to a savings address and 49% to a hot wallet address, then you should be ok.

Just ordered the 1000 MH/s Hashpack myself as that's all I can afford atm will see how it goes once it's setup, my investment address changed on the investment page overnight but I can confirm that if you still have the original IBA before it you can still send the BTC you want to invest and it will show after 6 confirmations.
I sent a email to them about it earlier and got a response within an hour.
Which gives me an idea to use the original IBA for my funds I want to invest and lend out the second IBA to friends and family if they want to help me invest in this in the future once we can confirm its security and stablility.

Imo, its the level of debt and how its resolved that is the issue; e.g. 
1.a) I choose not to have a credit card because banks will increase my limit without my consent and spam me with other cards aggressively and only use a savings card with an account that I know how much I can spend, thus in turn letting me choose products and offers I know I can pay off entirely and own them fully so that I do not waste my money on repaying the "credit" owed that is after a certain point still asked for thus making me pay for said product until they decide to take it from me if I stop paying for it.
1.b) I can pay for services I actually use and at my own prerogative when I can afford/need them for the task(s) I need to do. i.e. I can choose to put aside some savings to a subscription, find a free one off or if I know I have enough get a lifetime account with the service that I know I will be using regulatory in turn letting me put aside and future savings to the next set of bills.
2) If I borrow money only when I need it from people that I have gained a good reputation with and pay them back fully with and optional bonus not a mandatory one once I return to a steady pay amount then they are more likely to do the same in return if they borrow from me or we pull our funds together for a product/bill we are willing to share by agreement.
Right now the debt system is out of control with banks loaning out more money then they have + asking for mandatory interest with people that cannot afford to repay in the first place on top of the fed printing more money than is needed decreasing the purchasing power of peoples savings in an uncontrolled manner with the wages of the workers and people looking for jobs stagnating or even dropping to below minimum wages due to loopholes that the big businesses take advantage of (i.e unpaid internship, using the commission/franchise based system or getting students to pay for certain positions to get experience in excess of their chosen field thus increasing their debt from collages)
And adding to all that you have governments spending on things that don't need to be spent on just for the sake of spending; bail outs/ins to banks and companies that do not need the money just to hide their balance sheets, wasting money on services that people did not ask for nor use and building more housing for banks to sell loans to people that will never use them just for the sake of trying to keep the bubbles from popping in a cyclical fashion again and again and again not just in the US but Globally.

Please disregard some of my previous replies, all we need is an add on or use the config in the browsers. ie for the add on have a web wallet auto launch in a new tab or window for the user to login and use and all that needs to be done is adding that config line as default in future updates then you set you preferred client you want to use and have it remember after the first time use.
And for your other question the addon/web wallet/Bitpay/Coinbase etc works like paypal but for the decentralized nature of bitcoins.
Which is why for now a lot of people prefer to link a qrCode that people can scan on their phones and donate that way.

in Blockchain just tap the down arrow, hit exchange rates and tap the one that is for your local area, then you can just tap the btc amount on screen to alternate between values.
As for the transaction history via the summary, it displays the value for when it was sent and current in local once set as above.
Send/Request is still done in btc (im sure if enough people ask they could include the option on that screen)

As long as you keep your wallet.dat backed up and encrypted in multiple secure locations it does not matter if your system is wiped or not as the keys are stored in the wallet.dat (or in the case of blockchain wallet.json), as you just recopy your backed up copy ontop of the wallet.dat that is created on reinstall.

If one succeeds then it must offer something better than what bitcoin provides or it must offer something that bitcoin doesn't. The ones that fail prove that bitcoin is competitive. That doesn't mean that bitcoin will fail if one or more alt coins succeed since there is a huge market for these currencies to grow into. It also means there is some place for miners to go when they are out hashed by ASICs.
Bitcoin also has a big head start but there are some heavyweights with a lot of money behind them (Ripple).  Competition is good for consumers (us) though because it forces the producers to increase their product value either through efficiency or innovation (which from my point of view, some are being used as testing grounds for what we want in bitcoin). A symptom of the free market.

That I don't disagree with, but ye just a thought that came to me at random yesterday. xD
Will be interesting to watch how things evolve with all the options available today whilst the socioeconomic mindset evolves along side in the coming years.
Cause the centralised setup of ripple is perfect for M$, Apple, Google, Payapl etc to covert to/from if they don't want to add BTC/LTC support leaving the open peer-to-peer transaction system decentralised as I believe the two systems could co-exist if done right.
In the interm I personally have added donation options on my blog via BTC, LTC and Ripple to let people decide what they want to use and not be locked into one or the other as things progress. ;)
looking forward to see what others thoughts are.

Right now I think in terms of BTC as the digital gold standard, followed by LTC as silver, and others as based on value as copper. So in a way they compliment the direction our digital currency of choice esp with the fact you have the option to cross-covert them as needed if the option is added to your favorite exchanges.

The amount of money that banks can lend is directly affected by the reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve. The reserve requirement is currently 3 percent to 10 percent of a bank's total deposits. This amount can be held either in cash on hand or in the bank's reserve account with the Fed. To see how this affects the economy, think about it like this. When a bank gets a deposit of $100, assuming a reserve requirement of 10 percent, the bank can then lend out $90. That $90 goes back into the economy, purchasing goods or services, and usually ends up deposited in another bank. That bank can then lend out $81 of that $90 deposit, and that $81 goes into the economy to purchase goods or services and ultimately is deposited into another bank that proceeds to lend out a percentage of it.
Banks consistently extend more credit than they have cash, if everyone goes to the bank at the same time and demands their money (a run on the bank), there might be problem. Even though the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks keep a certain percentage of their money in reserve, if everyone came to withdraw their money at the same time, there wouldn't be enough. i.e Just what happened in Cyprus after the gov took the money from the accounts of the public savings accounts.

If they intend to mine for bitcoins with their hardware, then yes the cost's will add up for them (wasted energy is an excuse to not implement because of costs vs profitability); but to accept and spend bitcoins there is no added waste to cost or energy waste as they can use bitpay to accept payments for them then at the time of payment covert, to local fiat at market price and deposit to the account for the company.

This right here, I cannot express how important it is to use 2 factor authentication with withdrawals and the security center at the very minimum with mtgox and other sites you use that give you the option.
If you have a smartphone grab Authy or Google Authenticator and set it up else add your preferred mobile number where you want them to sms you the number(s).
Even thou 2FA is not the end all be all its an extra layer of protection, the more levels you can add the better.
Also on a side not use a tool like last pass set it to the highest pas length allowed and hit generate never use the same pass on multiple sites.

In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they’ll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy.
A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. In a ponzi scheme, early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters, and the late adopters always lose. Bitcoin has an expected win-win outcome. Early and present adopters profit from the rise in value as Bitcoins become better understood and in turn demanded by the public at large. All adopters benefit from the usefulness of a reliable and widely-accepted decentralized peer-to-peer currency.

Until security is proven and improved in online wallets its better to have your own cold storage vault with the wallet backup encrypted and stored in multiple encrypted locations where possible and use an online wallet for small day to day funds, which for the latter blockchain is a good choice for with it's 2 factor and per transaction backup to a linked cloud drive.
If you really want to go full offline then I recommend Electrum as it is multi-platform and via node servers you can use the android app to use your wallet on the go. (the install for the android client is done separately and a bit more complex than the usual play store way as its done via sl4a and python).

That's because it is still a maturing market and people are wanting to get as much ROI as they can between their fist investment and futures, just like any other shares or forex market.
It's the same as cash or savings accounts, set aside what you want to save then spend/invest the rest as needed.

If you want to mine I recommend saving up for an ASIC, mining Litecoins then converting them to bitcoins via an exchange like BTC-e for Bitcoins or as xrandr stated buy some from any exchange or local bitcoins service for where you are (and no you do not need to buy 1 whole bitcoin, you can buy half a bitcoin or less as you need to spend them), as right now you will not make anything mining bitcoins on a CPU, that phase has long past.

I'm sick of people wanting to sacrifice security for unneeded usability "fixes" (that 90% of the time make things worse) when they are too lazy to put in a few min to learn to use the current interface and how to do cold storage, you don't need to learn how the back end works to use the wallets as a basic user.

Mining is the term used for running a series of calculations on a computer to verify the transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network. About every ten minutes, a new block of transaction data is created and the miners who created the block are awarded a few bitcoins. This serves the Bitcoin network both as a system to verify transactions and as a system for fairly distributing new bitcoins.
Although it used to be profitable to mine bitcoins with your standard personal computer, the cost of the electricity necessary to do so is now greater than the value of the bitcoins you could mine. Profitable mining now requires specialized hardware that can perform more computations with greater power efficiency.

In traditional fiat money systems, governments simply print more money when they need to. But in bitcoin, money isn’t printed at all – it is discovered. Computers around the world “mine” for coins by competing with each other.

This is why we do not keep program installs on the same partition as the os and as stated above do regular backups.
I.e primary os partition or drive only needs to be 80-120gb in size for windows+updates, then have another physical drive for the backups and another for the actual installs.
That is how I keep things setup for non-mobile servers and towers, although you should be able to find some laptops with dual drive bays aswell.
Also if do not wish to use a local client you can use a wallet service like Coinbase and or Blockchain.info who handle all the backend blockchain storage for you and other users (only recommend them as a hot wallet and not a savings wallet).

Instead of adjusting value to the BTC, lock in the minimum real world value on the client and let the client adjust the BTC divisibility dynamically based on average market value, imo that would still lockout the spam whilst letting us keep the full 8 divisibility for times when a single BTC value skyrockets.
ie minimum is 1 cent so whats the divisible amount to get to based on current worth of 1 btc to get to 1 cent then adjust and send/receive.

^ that exactly, if you want to keep BTC in multiple locations, get an e-wallet with blockchain.info and just move funds over from the offline wallet as needed for on the go usage, as its best to use the offline wallet as a "interest" account for better term of the analogy and the blockchain wallet as your savings account for daily/weekly purchases.
Also on the side of address's when sending and receiving btc funds, don't go crazy creating them unless you need them so that you can label them for what you need them for, i.e. use your first created address's for both wallets as your "private" transfer links and create a secondary address for public transactions.
As an example I made this a yesterday for a few friends that were asking how to secure a wallet:  It might come in handy for others like yourself (OP).

From one of my earlier replies (for say buying major stakes in ASICS):
Actually, it's very easy to do damage to the network once you have 51%; just build your own chain faster than the network, and broadcast it whenever you like. If you send some of your coins to a new address in your own chain, all the transactions issued in the live network by spending those same coins will be reversed at the moment the longer chain is broadcast.
Right from the [bitcoin wiki]( (probably proof-read by many pairs of eyes) :


       Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control
       Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
       Prevent some or all other generators from getting any generations


        Reverse other people's transactions
        Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
        Change the number of coins generated per block
        Create coins out of thin air
        Send coins that never belonged to him




On the topic of the 21 million limit (also from the same page):


There was a consensus a few weeks back among most of the client dev's that people should use mBTC to get accustomed to it sooner rather than later.

Ya, I can see his point of view but: most Bitcoin exchange users are money laundering criminals, scammers, drug users or terrorists. ?- don't put the hate on all because of the few that take advantage and yes banks are the major bottleneck due to their hate of anything not in their control this is why we want to use fiat as little as possible over the next 5-10 years and use cryptocurrencies as much as possible, even if there are gov cryptocoins for each country/state/continent you will still have bitcoin for non gov related transactions, just convert as needed.

From my pov that's the exact same thing, you show how and ask for feedback then rework accessibility and usability. e.g. some of the offline wallets are reworking the GUI to make them more user friendly on both the desktop and mobile platforms.
To be honest, the majority of issues pertaining to accessibility is not on the client side but on the conversion side and that's where as I repeat my self on trying to promote CryptoATM's namely a bilateral [BitcoinATM]( [Lamassu]( and [eCoin]( as the main three that will bring bitcoins to "outsiders".

Just for those not in the know:




another NFC capable Android device that is requesting coins.


the "Request coins" dialog open). The "Send coins" dialog will open with fields populated.




  
  Other writers should work as well, let us know if you succeed.




  then share with messaging or email. You can also construct the URI by hand. Example for Prodnet:
  bitcoin:1G2Y2jP5YFZ5RGk2PXaeWwbeA5y1ZtFhoL




  could overwrite the tag with his own Bitcoin address.

Just showing that NFC will be and is available in most current wallets as a payment communication means for those that would like to use it.
An NFC card would work just like your bank card (i.e for purchases under $100 else you need the pin) today in essence just with a confirmation request sent to the application on the phone from what I am reading on the thread and project page.

You can use all three if you want, you are only limited by the time it takes them to fund your wallet from fiat after adding a funding option and by their separate fiat withdraw limits.
You can move as much BTC between them as you wish without limit, you are only bottle necked on the fiat side of the conversion.
Also I do hope you plan to have a offline brain/hardware/paper wallet to store all you coins and not keep them all on each exchange.

People hoard until they need to make a trade for that point in time.

Social engineering and attacks on the services that do not take their clients security seriously enough (and in turn clients that do not take their own security seriously enough).
Take a look at previous hacks on the services for examples such as Inputs.io and others. The protocol itself is not hacked, its the services built around it that are.
In terms of the blockchain this has been discussed in the past and we had a real scenario play out with feathercoin a few months back that is still being used to help devs learn about how it happened and how to prevent it, but in terms with bitcoin its not a major threat due to how much hashing power will be required to pull off the attack.

Yes it is possible; look to other crypto currencies, But right now as it stands there is no need as a single Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places (for current practicality reasons limited but in theory unlimited) or 100,000,000 satoshi. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) satoshi once we hit the 21 million peak in 2140.
This is also another reason why as the price value of a single bitcoin increases we are dealing with mBTC and smaller units over time by default.

Adding "features" and such from another coin will only be done via consensus if there is shown to be any benefit.
Scrypt(CPU/GPU Bound) based coins allow people without the ability to invest in ASIC's and are only of value if they are allowed to be traded for Bitcoins and other major coins like Litecoins.
Other than that as I said I see them more as a testing ground to mitigate any potential risks on the Bitcoins before implementation.

@_date: 2013-12-17 11:46:40
I beg to differ. Its because of bitcoins first mover advantage with the mining power that it will be a primary means of exchange, people have invested to much into this at this point to just up and move to another coin which by consensus if its features are beneficial to bitocin itself will be assimilated into and thus making the bitcoin a better investment in the long run.
There are always going to be altcoins, it's just a matter of where they best fit in the crypto-economy as a secondary means of exchange.

Would need a client that would keep the respective wallets separate but able to reference them in a single gui to make it user friendly instead of needing to run 4 separate clients on say the android phone.
i.e. Have the references listed in order of value and just tap the one you need to send/receive for, this way the user can see at a glance under the one client how many funds they have for each one. (something similar to what  does for BTC wallets you want to keep an eye on.)

When you setup with bitcointip a reddit blockchain.info wallet is created this allows you to keep funds separate from your personal everyday wallet, you can if you want sweep the private key and related public key address into your personal wallet or add it as a watch only address in your personal wallet (will be explained as you get into the links I have provided on how to do this)
If you do not already I recommend using keepass or lastpass to help manage your logins and only needing a master password to keep it all secure. This will allow you to make sure you minimise the chance of forgetting your login details to your blockchain wallets or other web logins aswell as generate a new unique password for those logins to stay secure.

Think of bitcoin as the decentralized payment system and not an asset, currency or money and in turn allowing people who travel alot to move in and out of what ever local fiat they need via bi-directional bitcoin ATM's until more brick and mortar places accept it by default via services like bitpay, coinkite or softouch.

You don't need to buy entire bitcoins. Think of $200 for the entire pie, where as you can pay a smaller amount for a piece or many pieces of that same pie to save for the future.
Bitcoins are divisible to 10^8 places or 1BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis displayed as 0.00000001 for one Satoshi. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible atomic units in the bitcoin design.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller [units]( such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).

No Gox and Dwolla were cut off from each other as tie in services, it listed under the withdraw and deposit link at the options they allow based on linked accounts.


ATTENTION: As of May 15, 2013 we no longer use Dwolla as a method of fund transfer.
Please use alternative transfer methods such as an International Wire transfer.

In the future label your addresses that you are actively using and if need be keep an offline list of them with your own usage graph for memory sake and double/triple check before you hit send/receive.

Especially with gyft planning to eventually have every posible giftcard in their search once they get more and more retailers onboard.
Bitcoin ATM's + Giftcoins/Cointap + gyft = more ways to get, share and use Bitcoins until more merchants that currently don't in general accept them in house, do.

On the topic of gift cards where possible and if you can, provide basic android smartphones with the donations for them you can set them up with their own coinbase or blockchain wallet and use gyft.
This way all funds go directly to them without 3rd parties taking a cut between you sending it out and them receiving the donated funds to their wallets to use on gyft and other items of need. 
As for clothing and goods:  and  are good places to look for places that ship to where its needed.

The only time they can enforce thier "regulations and law" is at the point of convertion to and from bitcoins, once you store, use and spend entirely in bitcoin they cannot do anything as the can only attempt it at the local fiat level.

Yes but at the same rate these BitcoinATM's would be alongside other bank ATM's in say 7/11 or your local petrol station, so that you don't need to travel all the way to the airport to use them otherwise they would be less practical in the long run.

Carbon Nanotube Electrode Lithium
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Using layers of carbon nanotubes—strong microscopic hollow threads with relatively large area—scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are developing a cathode (the electrode through which electrons flow out of a battery) that can store and release many more positive ions than a conventional lithium battery. The idea is that this new cathode could increase the amount of power stored in an electric car battery and increase the electricity flow by as much as ten times compared to current products. The development of these new battery cathodes could also enhance solid-state capacitors, or give rise to a combination battery/capacitor that could store and supply much more electricity than either device alone can today
Carbon Foam Capacitor Hybrid
Michigan Technological University
Scientists at Michigan Tech have been working on a power-storage device to combine the electrical-storage density of a chemical battery with the power-delivery efficiency of a solid-state capacitor. One impressive feature: a unique carbon foam used as a cathode to increase the storage capacity. Using a carbon anode, the hybrid battery/capacitor not only weighs less than a conventional lithium battery, but it also delivers more of its charge than a typical capacitor. The unit can be recharged thousands of times without showing signs of degraded performance.
Ontop of that using Bio-solar or Nanocrystal solar cell based paints on vehicle bodies with a Regenerative Braking system (Hell if you have solar panels installed and are not using you vehicle on a regular basis you can funnel surplus power into it during the peak day times) would help to solve alot of your issues, there are even plans to use solar cells built into the roads to increase global power production and use vertical wind blades to increase their efficiency even just for streetlamps at night as vehicles drive past.
Try thinking outside the box for once.

Actually with mesh networking through [OpenGarden]( this is not an issue by jumping the tx from one or multiple nodes (both mobile and pc/mac based) to the next, whilst [Bitcoincard]( will use a mesh radio network and the transactions will be propagated to internet at first opportunity. However, one Bitcoincard/OpenGarden gateway with working internet access in an entire city/neighborhood should be sufficient to prevent network forks.

Actually, it's very easy to do damage to the network once you have 51%; just build your own chain faster than the network, and broadcast it whenever you like. If you send some of your coins to a new address in your own chain, all the transactions issued in the live network by spending those same coins will be reversed at the moment the longer chain is broadcast.
Right from the [bitcoin wiki]( (probably proof-read by many pairs of eyes) :


       Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control
       Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
       Prevent some or all other generators from getting any generations


        Reverse other people's transactions
        Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
        Change the number of coins generated per block
        Create coins out of thin air
        Send coins that never belonged to him

Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, you can store your savings in your offline wallet that you backup at regular intervals in multiple storage locations then use a public wallet like coinbase or blockchain for non-private transactions, for offline storage I recommend Electrum if you do not wish to download the entire blockchain.
You also need to use a different address on every transaction / use a mixing service if you so wish.
More can be read [here](
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:59:30
Merchants can already use services like Bitpay to instantly liquidate to their local fiat at the time of transfer if they do not wish to hold on to those coins so they can pay their suppliers, for it to settle it will take a few more years as more and more merchants and people use it for everyday transactions on a more regular basis.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:46:33
1) Bitcoin total hashing power is ever increasing with every new asic added to the pools/network and governments have more important things than spending that money on a single target like bitcoin because of this.
2 &amp; 3) Bitcoins are set to be mined at a predictable pace and are not due to be fully mined until 2140 (well after our lifetime) and even with coin "bleed" via lost wallets that increases the overall value of the coins in circulation but that is not an issue even then as each coin is divisible to (currently) 8 decimal places or 100,000,000 Satoshi per coin with a total of 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) assuming no lost coins where as [current global public debt]( is estimated at $52.4 Trillion. In regards to the miners fee I quote from the wiki:

As posted by Gavin Andresen on 
But you can use clients like Electurm (desktop) and Electrioid (android) to connect to any node on the network that hosts the blockchain right now and in the future. 
If you have setup external storage (with 3TB drives available today) you can keep regular backups of the blockchain and just connect online to do periodic updates.

The ledger works and is setup to prevent double spending by allowing you to only spend what you have access to via a 2 receipt system per transaction, the amount sent with the remaining balance received for every transaction even without the confirmation, the only way to do a double spend is to mine enough blocks ahead with more than 50% of the hashing power and have all the miners agree on your chain within that average of 10 min per block.

Too many are not good, too little not good either, right now imo we have a good amount to choose from for offline wallets with a good diversity of devs between them.

Whats stopping them is their lack of insight and interest in only debasing fiat and only once they have done so and have no other option then they will try implement their own coin that is centralized so they can control it, at that point people will be too far into using Bitcoin and other decentralized altcoins for their needs that the only reason to enter and exit the govcoins will be to pay for what ever gov only uses they have.

Ye you need to only import the private key for a public key you already have set as watch if you want to import that address to your wallet, sweeping the private address will only move those funds from your watched address if you are scanning its private key into your currently set default public address on blockchain.
if you have a watched address already set via the phone and want to import it my advice is to use the website and use the import private key option there, else use the app on the phone if you want to sweep it into your main address.
