Bitcoin is not comparable to Visa as it is to dollars. Visa allows you to spend dollars you don't have, but they could just as well accept bitcoin and let you spend bitcoin you don't have.

I was looking at the page in my local language (I was automatically redirected) and it says: "Geen verborgen kosten en een fooi is inbegrepen."
which means "No hidden fees and a tip is included.".
That indeed contradicts with the English version.

A tip is included.

Please don't do this.
You harm the tor network by bottlenecking it, because you're running a relay on a low-end connection with ultra-low-end hardware.
You'll probably not get donated more than a half cent worth of bitcoin, because your stats (bandwidth, uptime) are very low.

"Redditor-created" sounds more fancy than it is. Bill Gates is also a redditor right?

Ziggo is ISP, ISP is internet, bitcoin is also internet. That means you can but Internet with Internet. :D

You can't *stop* a method. You can only make it illegal, which only stops legitimate uses.

Yes. I don't believe vaccines today are causing mental disorders, but some day there could be that do.

It's still called bit*coin* though.

To be very clear, his argument is **against** net neutrality. He says cable companies can discriminate however they want, and the government should not do anything about it.
It is very special how he can make it sound as if he wants a free internet. That is because "freedom" has two meanings in this debate. From one side it's the freedom of cable companies to do whatever they want, and from the other side it's the freedom of the actual users to do what they want.

What's insecure about a Raspberry Pi running open source software? How does adding an embedded ASIC and some closed-source software make it more secure?

There's a pic of two schooners in front of a tablet running bitcoin-software.

The last bullet point of the [CCC hacker ethic]( gets it pretty right on this point: Make public data available, protect private data.

A lot of active girls (way more than in GirlsGoneBitcoin) are posting nudes in exchange for 20 cents worth of bitcoin, and nearly nobody is commenting.
Are.. are those bots?

Yes, but only the polish division accepts bitcoin.

Of course there is. While Apple is an american company, many open source repos have nothing to do with america at all.

If it costs billions to take over the network, it would be cheaper to buy all the bitcoins.
