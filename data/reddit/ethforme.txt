I think kraken is no longer operating in Japan.

That's why I don't tell ANYBODY about my crypto investments.

I was doing a sweep on the exchanges I used since I got involved in cryptos, turns out I had some BTC dust forgotten somewhere that is now worth almost $160 :)
Bought LTC with it and moved to my main exchange. Very nice.

Ha, I have a measly 80MH/s rig which gives me 0.05 Eth every 4 days or so, I don't have much at all. 
My nickname comes from wanting more eth haha

Can somebody please donate some BTC to this man? I don't own any otherwise i would've. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:24:03
Every time I scroll my Blockfolio, BTC is a little more valuable while my alts keep bleeding. 
I'm too poor to own any significant amount of BTC, so I keep buying different kinds of alts. 
Meanwhile, I'd be better off just buying BTC all along, even in small amounts. 
I actually hate the fact that I got in so late in the crypto game, I only I stumbled across this one year ago...

We are in the pre-historic times in crypto. 
Right now men are hunting and gathering, women are not part of the equation.

It depends. I believe BTC market cap is gonna reach $1T in the next five years. By then, the whole market is gonna be much more mature, ICOs starting today might actually have products on the market, so if you choose wisely and get lucky, you might get pretty rich. 
Or just buy BTC now and hope for the best, if my $1T prediction happens, you will 10x on your investment. 
I'm on the lookout for disruptive tech, IOTA being one of my choices, WTC too.

That's the last fork in the horizon (AFAIK), so after the FUD from that dissipates, I predict a big rally towards the $10k range, Alts tanking hard and after that, BTC is gonna correct some again and then it will be the time for the alts to shine.

"90% of the world doesn’t know what crypto currencies are let alone knows how to use it."
That's exactly why it will continue to rise as more people know about it.
I'll take my chances on that.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:36:00
Do you absolutely need to use it?
You're paying a hefty premium there, you're also running the risk of being scammed.
I'd avoid if all possible.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:50:33
I vaguely remember mining BTC while it was still possible with only CPU. 
I've changed computer many many times since them, don't remember how much I mined, nor in which computer I did it. 
Lost coins forever.

I use Bitflyer, wire deposits are pretty much instantaneous and there's no withdrawal fee for cryptos.
I've tried to get verified on Kraken, still waiting after 2 months.
Took only a few days on Bitflyer.
Note that I don't trade there, I just use it to buy ETH or BTC, and move to a real exchange (Bittrex or Binance).
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:02:02
Your biggest chance might come at the Seg2x fork.
After that it's gonna shoot straight up to the $10k range.
You might see $4600~$4800, but thats about it.
If I had money, I'd just buy and hold for a while.
Lots of people predicting $25k next year, it won't matter much if you wait for it to drop a couple hundred.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:13:56
Well, good luck waiting for that...
Tip: It just not gonna happen.

I live in Japan as well, and a lot of people here don't even use google, A LOT of stores accept only cash for payments, a lot of folks still rocking a flip phone...
It's weird, it's like a very modern society in specific pockets (Tokyo, Osaka and the like) and the majority it's still very behind the times. 
Talking to some regular people in factories, I can guarantee you, nobody even know what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:24:30
Do you realize that those days are gone?
BTC was once $0.02, so it might fall back to that again, right?
BTC is so big nowadays that if it ever drops 90%, the whole crypto market will colapse on itself and then you can buy all the now worthless BTC you want.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:42:13
Is yet another BTC fork, this is gonna be a big one. Google it. 
It really depends, the last two forks saw btc rise to new ATH both times leading up to the fork. 
This one might be different, as there's more confusion about where the hashrate will go. 
It could get ugly. 
If you're long term holder, just buy in little chunks averaging your price. 
If you want to trade the swings, I'd wait a bit more, good chance it will be below $5k in the next days.

Unlucky with almost 1000BTC? Riiight. 
I'd cash out at least a million right away.  Put that into some safe, boring bank invest that generates monthly interest, immediately stop working and go live life. 
Leave the rest in different hardware wallets across multiple locations, you can even rent out space in a bank vault. 
What a nice problem to have...
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:32:50
Just buy a bunch of GPUs, mine ETH and exchange that for BTC.
You just need an email and you're set.
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:29:37
I have almost nothing worth of cryptos, but the idea of spending any of it in such an early stage seems super difficult to me. 
Even spending and replacing it, anything over $50 I might as well buy that amount in BTC and hodl.  
I know this is a mentality that will slow down adoption, but I don't want fast adoption for now, I still need to accumulate.

As a teen, you probably have a some free time to spare.
So research about another cryptos, learn how and where to trade, build a solid portfolio, set a % of profit where, no matter what, you sell those alts and move back to BTC. 
Don't forget to check the alt to BTC ratio, not the value in $.
I'd split that 0.12 in 0.02 units, pick 6 promising alts and put 0.02 in each.
I'll give you one for free:

I had success with PayPal and virwox.
Be prepared to pay around 10%in fees though. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:25:39
Its hard because so much of my thoughts are dedicated to cryptos   and the future, my mining efforts, trading and all that jazz, yet I  can't talk about it.  
She definitely wouldn't understand nothing but the fact that I might have some money stored somewhere, so let's spend it all.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:49:59
I'd advise you to not go around telling GFs about how much money you have. 
If she can prove cohabitation in any way, you're done.
