I'm guess still missing the part of your argument where the growth curve has to match for there to be any similarities


Ok we'll let's assume for arguments sake that Bitcoin started at the same time as WWW and the growth curve has to match precisely for there to be any similarities. That means in the next year or two we'd see the Mosaic equivalent for Bitcoin launched and every year after exponential growth. 
So I guess for now even under your arguments cnstraints it all still checks out but who knows what tomorrow holds.

The mosaic of Bitcoin hasn't even begun development yet..

ManGo terminals. You can't buy Bitcoin through them, you can exchange money into their service called Webmoney which can then be converted to Bitcoins from a web browser (not on the terminal). Huge waste of time.

I can name several movies that line is from so either your Grandpa is super un-original or you are. Not sure which.

In case you haven't seen it pretty great insight to how he and his company feel about it,

Tell that to my folks, they wanted no part of it until the late '90's and the fear mongering had worn off. Can't get them off it these days.

Nope not a fortune teller and the internet had been around for 10+ years prior to 1990. 
Needless to say Bitcoin will not show the same growth pattern even if mass adoption does occur one day but it'd be a fools errand to just flat out deny the similarities.

Would be great if there was some sort of url hash. For example if I wanted to post a link to show what the price was exactly 1 year ago today I could do something like ( and it would open with those settings. Just an idea.

I think you mean inside agents. A lot of outside agents can devalue it.

That seems like a very unusual response, curious what it is about the protocol once you understood that turned you off from it

I'm so confused, why are you selling Starbucks gift cards through an online poker site. Also why would you need 550 addresses to do this.

Agreed, local consumer to business transactions are the least exciting part of this technology and yet so much effort is spent in this area
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:20:40
You need to specify what part of the internet you're talking about. 
The technology for the internet was born in the 60's. Sometime around '81 you could actually begin interacting with the network. WWW was around '87 and Mosaic was '93 so what timeline are you using as the starting point?
