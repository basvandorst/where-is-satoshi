You can easily just spend the BTC and then exchange the appropriate amount of fiat to BTC. That way at the end of the day, you're net zero, but you helped stimulate the bitcoin economy and get coins into a wider amount of hands.
Hell, if you're programming inclined you could write a program that checks your wallet and sends a buy request to an exchange automatically. Or you can just manually top off at the end of the day/week/etc; the volatility will help stabilize any small losses you might have had due to waiting.

The default is first in, first out (FIFO). You can select other models, but only when selling, not at tax time. And the broker has to support specifying which particular stock you're selling, which I don't think any Bitcoin platforms do.

The way I see it, the more merchants that accept BTC, the better the exposure and the more people will start to trust it as a valid form of currency. This will convince others to invest in Bitcoin themselves. Also, if merchants see the price of BTC relative to their local fiat currency continue to go up steadily and they have a healthy amount of people paying using BTC, they'll be more inclined to stop converting immediately.

Yes, it does. There are long-term capital gains and short-term capital gains. The chart above only shows long-term capital gains. Any Bitcoin you sell that you've held for less than a year, you owe short-term capital gains taxes on, which is the same as ordinary income.

I mean, I wouldn't really say that's the literal translation though... Replacing "は" with "is" is just a hacky rule of thumb. A more literal translation would be "Speaking of Bitcoin, Bitflyer!"


I think it's 「明日は晴れるさ」, so something like "Tomorrow will be bright", presumably because we have Bitcoin now. :P

Note: I believe Coinbase doesn't *need* and ID, but they have some pretty strict buy and sell limits on people who don't share their ID with them.

Of course.

This was not a wise investment, then; it was a short-term gamble. You are in need of this money in near future, and thus should not have it in an asset as speculative as Bitcoin.

I think they're not really responding *to* you, but just talking about some of the reactions in the sub in general.

OP didn't say to never invest more than you are *able* to lose; they said willing. The risk to your current lifestyle might be minimal, but the risk to your net worth (and thus current lifestyle potential) is a very different story. Not everyone is willing to gamble a large percentage of their net worth just because that was profit off a previous smaller gamble.

"Striking it big" is relative, though. Is 3x "big", or is 10x? 100x? If Bitcoin is not a long-term investment for someone but instead an attempt to multiply their current money supply quickly, then admitting "I've reached a point of growth I'm happy with and am willing now to cash out" I think is reasonable.
