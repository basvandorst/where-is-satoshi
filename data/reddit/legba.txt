I was thinking more in terms of Paypal, but for bitcoin. You know, the way you can put up a donation button on a website and receive funds directly to your Paypal account, everything is really being handled by Paypal for a fee. The visitor/customer gets an easy and secure way of paying using a credit card, and you get your funds directly into your bank account. It's hard to believe that something like that doesn't exist for bitcoin yet.

The only way a contract of that type can be valid is if one of the parties involved OWNS the thing in question. For example, you don't need to sign a contract for a simple sale to be valid because it is implied in the fact that the owner of a thing is transferring ownership to the buyer through the act of selling, thus fulfilling a contract. If you want to use a road, and if that road is owned by someone, then by the act of using it you're agreeing to a possible fee that is levied on the use of that road by the owner.
When you talk about "social contract" in similar terms, the implication would be that the State OWNS everything within its borders, including all the land, all the goods and all the people. When did the State acquire these ownership rights and how did it acquire them?


And trade one slave owner for another? LOL. Yeah, I guess a cow can move from one farm to another. It's still enslaved. Besides, why would the State have the right to compel me to emigrate just because I don't recognize its bogus claim of total ownership over everything?

Oh, it's very relevant because Apple already pulled bitcoin wallet apps from the App store once before, which made me switch, and it shows the stupidity of the "walled garden" philosophy. I don't think any bitcoin user should support that mentality and business practice and that's why I'm writing this now. Also, I wanted to say fuck you Apple once more, thanks for making it possible.

In some aspects, yes. Particularly in the area of free markets. By definition a free market is "a market system in which the prices for goods and services are set freely by consent between sellers and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority." In China today this is much more true than in most "western democracies". And as Milton Friedman once noted, "you can have economic freedom without political freedom, but not vice versa".

China is more capitalist than the West right now, even though it's state capitalism. The Chinese experiments with actual communism were the "Great Leap Forward" and the "Cultural Revolution", and hopefully we all know how that turned out. For those that don't - literally tens of millions of Chinese died.

The power a government wields is largely an illusion. It depends entirely on the cooperation of the governed. Even today, government thugs are so heavily outnumbered that no amount of guns or violence would save them if the governed decided to ignore them or turn on them. In that sense, once a society shifts into philosophical and ethical anarchism en masse, there is exactly zero chance of anything remotely similar to a state successfully reestablishing itself in that society.

Does Bitpay allow both types of transactions? Bitcoin to cash and cash/credit card to bitcoin? In other words, if I want to accept CC payment/donations from visitors to my site and get the funds in bitcoins, can Bitpay do that?

The dollars capitalization is also infinitely larger and thus far more resistant to speculative pressures. Bitcoin is volatile precisely because it is young and undercapitalised, but as it matures stability is to be expected. Until that happens, "medium of exchange" part of the equation will drive acceptance and, consequently, capitalization.
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:15:56
The answer is "maybe". Surely, if the value of bitcoin was going up rather than down, it would be the best store of value there is. Would I save my wealth in bitcoin at this point? The answer is "probably some, but certainly not all". In the end, this is a non-issue. Anyone who thinks that keeping your money in the bank is the best way to store value needs a serious reality check. The fiat currency inflation alone guarantees your money is worth less each day it remains idle.

Actually, depending on how the shares are distributed on the market, Zuckerberg doesn't have to see a dime. Let me explain - once a company goes through an IPO, like Facebook has, it means it is no longer privately owned. At least a part of it is traded publicly. This essentially means that the owners see no further profit from the shares that have been sold off and are being traded in the stock market, except through potential appreciation of value of individual shares, based on the market demand. Depending on the percentage of shares that have been auctioned off in the IPO and subsequent sell-offs, a scenario can emerge where an investor like the Winklevoss twins can come in, buy up 50.1% of shares on the stock market and take over control of the company without the "original" owners profiting in any way from this development. Sure, they can always sell off their remaining shares, but that would be exactly the scenario that would eliminate Zuckerberg from running his own company.

Even if libertarians are "outside the norm", which I don't believe (who decides what's "normal"?), there are a bunch of words that can be used to describe them, without resorting to calling them crazy (which is as inaccurate as it is offensive). These are some synonyms for "out of the ordinary":
different, atypical, extraordinary, original, novel, peculiar, strange, unconventional, unusual, unique, avant-garde, outlandish, remarkable, offbeat, exceptional, etc.
"Crazy" is such a lazy word, don't you think?

If you knew anything about debating, you would now it's not about convincing the opposition, but convincing the audience. Every time you go into one of your infantile "Your philosophy sucks and I'm not biased because I say so" rants, you alienate someone in the audience, and turn them away from your point of view.

Kinda like that famous Vitas Gerulaitis quote, "And let that be a lesson to you all. Nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row.", 
after defeating Jimmy Connors at the January 1980 Masters. He lost the previous 16 matches.

Keep an eye on bitcoinity.org/markets. When you see that second upward spike forming in a few hours or days, that's the time to sell (you can wait for the highest possible price but I wouldn't recommend it, just sell on the upward trend), and then wait for the market to drop (and it will drop) to buy back your bitcoin, and pocket the change you earned (or reinvest it, your choice). You don't have to be a day trader to earn a few hundred easy bucks in a market this volatile.

Unfotunately, this does nothing for those who hurt their knees in the kneejerk panic bitcoin sell-off. Oh the irony.

No, it dropped because a lot of people tried to sell at 900. These orders flooded the market with bitcoins and the price plummeted. Now a lot of other interesting things start to happen, like those who didn't sell at 900 panicking and selling off, just to be met by bullish investors ready to buy more. It's a "dead cat" bounce that will drive the price up to close to 900 again (but not above) and then you'll have another massive drop to around 300-400 where it will probably stabilize for the next few months as the "new normal". In other words, it makes no sense to either sell or buy right now, wait for the rally to sell, and then wait for stabilization to buy.

I think he meant it more in the sense of inflation and taxation than anything else. Of course they can be stolen, but if you take certain reasonable measures to protect yourself, your wealth is FAR more secure than in any bank or vault because no third party (like the government) can just come and take it, in fact, with a bit of effort, no one even knows who they belong to.

Every bank at the very least has a very decent video surveillance system, a direct line to the police, and at least one security guard, armed or unarmed. Makes even the most hardened criminal think twice about pulling a fast one since it would put so much heat on him he might as well just rob the bank instead.

A bank would do just as well and wouldn't discourage paranoids.
