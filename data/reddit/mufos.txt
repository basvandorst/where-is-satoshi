This is also in part due to rapid hashrate increase while the difficulty has not been adjusted. However, SegWit dominance is awesome!

Just wait for the future, man. AI gonna be like "You aint upgrading my CPU?" *shuts down*

What? This is regarding the lawsuit site.

That's not my point. My point is 1% is 1%

Looks so nice not seeing bcash there :&gt;
@_date: 2018-05-03 09:55:52
Then they should force redirect to the https-version.

What? 1% is 1%. If you get micropaid a total of $100 from hundreds of microtransactions, it still is $1 fee. Likewise, $100,000 - Will be $1000 in fees.

They should really get an SSL-certificate to prevent MITM-attacks that could possibly modify the donation address.
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:30:37
Which in Bitcoin, it is not.

NS obviously meaning Nakamoto, Satoshi

What do you mean? More cumulative PoW = harder to create a fake chain with more work, thats the whole point of PoW - more hashrate = more secure

Indeed, one could argue the protocol specification came about the release of the first few versions of the "Bitcoin QT".
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:24:47
Indeed, couldn't agree more. There is nothing special with the technology in BCash compared to Bitcoin. Simply a copy/paste with adjusted block size. So happy about their low fees, while their user-base is a fraction of that of Bitcoin.

This is ... too f*cking good!

Yea, fundamentally random quantum processes must be banned... smh.

I am not talking about a Core coin - which is my point exactly.

Hex dump of the genesis block.

Technically, Bitcoin would still be immutable. This is just an example of what the public ledger (the blockchain) makes us able to do.

I would argue that publishing something like that in a news paper in the early stages of the internet, is not something like validating a theory made by someone with a brain injury.
Bare in mind, we are in the early adoption stages. I would wager that someone, at some point in the late 90s, confused Windows with the Internet.

More decentralized mining about to get real for the time to come!
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:23:57
Indeed, it does. However, what I was referring to, is the fact that throughput is usually presented in tx/s, while I argue that isn't presenting the whole story.

Awesome! Probably the best lightweight desktop wallet.
Maybe not the easiest to use for the layman, but more experienced users can appreciate the features.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:41:31
Not really, the point of bitcoin is to be your own bank; and to free you from censorship. Sure, the way to buy bitcoin at the best price is through exchanges, but you can always buy it through other means.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:04:20
Haha, good one
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:48:25
No matter how much some people bash Coinbase, this is still great news for Bitcoin as a whole, and it will encourage further adoption.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:21:29
Depends on the fee you set*.

Not trying to cause drama - simply trying to clear up confusion.
