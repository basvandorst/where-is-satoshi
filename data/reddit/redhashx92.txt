Nahh, when lambo is cooler..hahahah
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:50:36
Wow, such empty
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:19:35
Guys, he said 'almost' no one..please hear it carefully..i would agree to that..most of bitcoiners today use them as speculative store of value rather than a means of payment (at least for now).
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:09:27
No need any context..i'm just brought up an old memes that's all.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:19:55
@_date: 2019-07-06 19:42:28
New lambo, yes..but according to the website, they mentioned specifically aventador..not sure y though..of course the price will still be high by that time..but at least an old lambo is cheaper than new lambo in 2037..
By the way, the btc at that time will increase 7x-8x as much, how about that? (Just an uneducated prediction)

The neck is real
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:19:02
I'll keep adding and hodl, DCA, then there will be the time we can say "TODAY'S LAMBO!!!!!"
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:10:09
Oh i have more, just curious what if i put just a little amount of btc by today's rate, when can i lambo.
Btw, the amount of btc that one has is not reflected one's experiences in crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-06 19:25:33
How about Civic? :)
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:01:54
Becareful what u wish for
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:16:33
U must be new i guess..i mean, if u r not familiar with this then i can assume u r new..just google 'when lambo', u'll find the site..happy lambo!!!
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:16:40
Not all can save full amount of monthly salary without deducting commitments, or have huge salary that can practically save 70% of them to buy lambo in some years.. At least for this..we just park small amount of btc now and can lambo 18 years later..that's like 99.99% discount on 1 lambo
@_date: 2019-07-06 14:28:04
Late joining crypto or what?
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:09:44
U dont know about this?
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:54:00
How can lambo if static? For example today got 1 btc priced 10k, then if the price static, 1 btc will still be 10k even in 2037..so it's like i said, either the price have to increase, or keep adding and hodl...
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:53:30
No need one, he's just stupid that's all
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:32:28
Wait..i'd rather buy the the 'stand' for the same price
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:04:14
Think it's 103 this year? ��
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:14:28
What do u mean by remain static? If the price remain static with the same btc, then i'll get no lambo even forever..if i keep adding, even the price remain static, yes i will lambo or if i stop adding, just hodl, n the price increase, i will lambo too..
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:06:51
Nice car right? ��
At least we still can logically own it. Regardless of btc rises or not..lol
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:59:40
Please dont buy high
@_date: 2019-07-07 09:30:23
Well old Billy is the billionaire of fiat. We can too, just trust Bitcoin and HODL. ��
@_date: 2019-11-08 05:10:54

@_date: 2019-08-03 05:24:15

Or just one giant whale to get in
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:06:39

@_date: 2019-08-03 05:23:29

@_date: 2019-08-03 14:27:16
This post is also related to apple, even though the main point is about btc, so what's wrong in talking about apple too..

@_date: 2019-08-05 09:50:20
I'm DCA and hodling, whats wrong with that..i guess pretty much hodler here do that..
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:40:16
I'm just hodling for fun, n for some future profit, i have a job as my main source of income, but my salary is not so much which allow me to diversify my investment..i'm a finance major..i know a thing or two about investing, thx for the tip anyway..
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:06:13
