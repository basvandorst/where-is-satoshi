So why not make a new token with only 5 million computer digit token or coins???.. 
Oh and say its diamonds 2.0 ???..
The logic to your mind is bitcoin has only 21 million???..
So why not use the same logic and make a token with only 5 million computer digits on a screen and say OH 
diamonds 2.0 ......only 5 million imagine how much they go up because only 5 million digits on a screen.
And each one splits into 1 millions bits..
The way humans minds can be tricked into believing in bad logic..
Why Disney dollars?.. 
when you work out the point of Disney dollars then you might be able to do something useful with all these blockchains out there..
Why did Walt Disney sell you his Disney dollars????..
Why not just good old cash???..

You have rules to how your bitcoin works in code..
I have much better rules to how a digital computer token should work..
And yes it can be written in code..
Life is about LOGIC..  Bad logic then that means a bad outcome..
One day soon a token will come out that will be what a true blockchain " TOKEN " should be used for..
You can have blockchains without  the token or coins &lt; Not really tokens or coins they are computer digits on a screen.  You know I am right..  Ok try and grab your tokens or bitcoins ..See just digits on a screen..&lt; rules..
And the rules I have smash bitcoins rules of how it works..

I believe bitcoin creator is back to lead the way?.
He said he has come back to lead the way into a new dawn.
He got to beat my idea of a blockchain to be the best.
Why is it so?  what does it do that's so fantastic?.
Funny how much you can do with a bit of paper with rules added .
What will be your new rules MR BITCOIN creator?.   I wait to see .
With rules comes logic ,  if the logic to your rules are broken then so will your blockchain.
