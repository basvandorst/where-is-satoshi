Not really, how many articles were positive while the price was going up.

Most likely this, I don't think I have heard one person mention Bitcoin in my workplace.

How would the IRS prove what I used my btc for anyway. Useless they can track the btc to a major business they can't prove anything. How can they claim what the btc was used for anyway.

At this point it can easily crash as much as it could keep going up. The real gain would have been me keeping all my btc last year, not investing now. A few months ago I could have put 5k to it as well, but again now is too late and too risky for me.

I was using btc quite a bit in the past few years and although this spike is great I doubt it will last long. Value is based off market usage and I really doubt the surge is from people who genuinely will be using it day to day. The hype will die eventually and the price will go down. I'm sure all the exposure will add quite a bit of people using it and it will be steady in the few thousand but I can't see it maintaining anywhere near where it is headed.

I had a bunch of bitcoins, bought pc parts from new egg and some other shit. Not like I was going to hold on to it for 5+ years hoping it eventually was worth something.

Do you honestly think the amount of active users of btc has multiplied by over 10x since last year. Do you think all the people putting in money now have an interest in using btc day to day.

Seeing it go up depresses me.

I honestly doubt it will "change" the world, it has its uses but I can't see the price being maintained anywhere over a few thousand in a few years. People are just getting hyped and investing into it now making the price surge. I really doubt the market place will stay as steady.

Honestly it would make me feel a bit better if btc just completely crashed.

I had a few btc last year spent around $2000 on pc parts and audio equipment from newegg. I'm a bit salty looking how much that btc would have been worth now. Only have .037 btc left.

I already have some but not much compared to what I had last year.

That is why some of the largest companies that previously accepted btc as a form of payment no longer do. The relatively consistent trend btc had is gone and it isn't worth them risking taking it as a payment. Dell, Microsoft, steam, stripe.

You think it will be. Don't kid yourself you have no idea what its value will be next year. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:44:43
because it is way closer to a digital commodity than a currency.

Could be Coinbase users considering they are the easiest way to get in and charge fees.
