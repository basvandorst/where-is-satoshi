The article states that this is a one-way machine. You can only buy BTC, not sell them. The owner doesn't fill the machine with cash, the users do when they buy his BTC. Which they most likely won't, because they would rather keep their cash.

Yes, and pretty much all CC issuers charge you 1-3% extra if you use it to purchase in a foreign currency. Like you and I would when using it on Gyft, or any other US store.


Technically true, but I can use those points to reduce the price for my next purchase. I don't have to collect $10 worth of points to make a $10 purchase. If I only have $3 worth of points, I can reduce that next $10 purchase to $7.
Again, do you know another shop where I can purchase a $100 US iTunes code for less than $100 with PayPal or CC?

Yes, **debit** cards. Not credit cards.


The only country mentioned in the article that has a majority of purchases handled in debit/credit cards is the UK. France has less than 50%, and most of that is debit cards, not credit. There's a big difference.


Feel free to prove that this initial statement is true outside of the US/Canada. It certainly isn't in Europe, as I've just shown.
Or rather, prove that this statement was true:


@_date: 2014-10-15 17:43:34


They are calling the Google Wallet promotion a limited time offer. They don't call the Bitcoin offer that. Gyft has to pay 2-3% processing fees for customers using Google Wallet. It's less than 1% (depending on who is their processor) for Bitcoin customers. It doesn't make financial sense to incentivize the use of Google Wallet, PayPal or CC over Bitcoin, besides what Google is paying them for the promotion.


Well, some people like saving 1-3% on a purchase for the few extra seconds it takes. I just did it yesterday. But if you can point me to another store where I can instantly buy a $100 US iTunes code for less than $100 with PayPal or CC, I'd be thankful for that.

Yet. As you might have noticed, the Google Wallet 5% bonus is a limited time offer, probably financed by Google to promote Google Wallet. Gyft would still have to pay credit card fees to Google and/or credit card companies once that time limited promotion ends. With Bitcoin, not so much.


So you can't get that 5% bonus either? That sounded a lot different earlier.

Yes, they must be going through the months-long process and all the work of creating this elaborate promotion purely because they don't value BTC and want to get rid of them. /s
If they JUST wanted to give their BTC away because they "don't value" them, there would be much easier and quicker ways, like donating to an already established charity. They clearly rather see "gifting" these Bitcoin to students as a long term investment, getting more people involved in the ecosystem that haven't had contact with BTC before.

Nope, a lot of businesses accept debit cards, but don't accept credit cards.

The big difference is that when you increase the "number of units of money" in the case of the dollar (by printing new dollars) by a factor of 1000, everyone who already has dollars has the value of his savings reduced by 99.9%. On the other hand, if you increase "the number of units" of Bitcoin by dividing it by 1000 and start trading in mBTC, the value of the Bitcoins you already had won't change.
@_date: 2014-11-04 02:51:53


You mean like moving $/€ from one PayPal account to another?


Slippage? Really? Unless you are trying to cash out a (small or large) fortune, slippage isn't really an issue. And I didn't face huge costs or a "hassle" the last time I ordered a few pizzas with bitcoins, or bought a steam key. I spent **exactly** the same amount I would have spent using PayPal or any other payment option, including cash. Buying bitcoin isn't an issue either. Depositing € to Kraken is free, and the transaction fee for buying/selling is 0.35%.
I think you really don't know what you are talking about, and have never actually used Bitcoin yourself. Am I right?
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:50:41
That's bull, and you know it. It is an experiment/promotion, to get more people to use it. If someone wanted to get rid of thousands of $ worth of bitcoin, he would sell them on an exchange and take the money, instead of giving it out for free.

Which makes a big difference when it comes to the accumulation of debt. 
But of course credit card debt is only one contributor to overall household debt. It's rather a correlation in attitude towards voluntary debt(taking a credit/loan/mortage) that is much different in the US compared to Germany (and to some extent Europe).

10% is actually the best case scenario with Western Union.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:04:07


Even IF those numbers would apply to my credit card (they don't, both cashback and exchange rate are both at 1.5% for non-specific purchases, as in this case for example), Bitcoin would still be cheaper overall, due to the 3vs1 points advantage being greater than the difference between the 3% cashback and 1.95% exchange rate. Does your card(with the 1.94% exchange rate) have a 3% cashback on ALL purchases?


According to all the information I can find, the address/name of the credit card has to match those of the google account. So no. Bitcoin is still cheaper.


Well, good for you. Because the cost average of my coins is well below $100, you really wouldn't like to include my "value fluctuation" in your calculations. ;)

I don't think it's that simple.

And you think Thermos, funneling donated funds to his college friends and rigorously censoring dissenting opinions, is any better?

d'oh ... too late to complain? I was counting on your promise to extend the promotion for 2h and therefore saw no need to complain.

Nope, both don't require any confirmations. Just because they use Coinbase or Bitpay doesn't mean that they don't accept 0-conf. 
Have you actually used them? I did.
Edit: In fact, I just did it again. I bought the Team17 Bundle from Humble and got my keys the second I sent the transaction. No confirmations yet.
Edit2: 
First confirmation 14mins after I got the keys. I also just bought the "Just Cause 3 - Weaponized Vehicle Pack DLC Steam CD Key" on G2Play. Instantly got the key and already redeemed it on Steam.

Humble Bundle, G2Play and most of the other key sellers I have tried(i think MMOGA and Greenmangaming, but not sure about those two) use 0-conf. Got my key within seconds/minutes each time.

Bull. If it's confirmed, it's confirmed. It always surprises me how little you know about Bitcoin, considering you spend all day trolling this sub.

More likely the operators will run with the money as soon as they notice that A) they are suddenly in control of a ginormous amount of money and/or B) they messed up speculating with their customers' money(shorting the coins) and can no longer cover the outstanding balances now that the price has gone up.

Add a Bitcoin-icecube-tray to your site, make a thread on reddit, and I'm sure you'll get a few orders.

I'd rather pay full price(and wait for proper bitcoin integration) than have the police kick in my door because I've received goods that were paid for with a stolen credit card.

Bitcoinity gifs are back, just saw this at 400:  :)

Yea, I started mining in 2011 when the price first entered the single digits, and kept mining (and buying more when the rapidly rising difficulty made mining too inefficient) all the way up to $30. 
I was pretty bummed when the price tumbled afterwards back down to $2, but as you say, that pain is mitigated by the fact I never sold(well, I spent a little on pizza and steam keys) and still have most of my coins. :)

That can't happen unless Cryptsy are tracking transactions solely by the transaction hash. If they are still doing that 1 1/2 years after MtGOX used it as an excuse for losing their customers' funds, that's even more of a reason to stay away from Cryptsy.
Guess why other exchanges aren't halting/delaying withdrawals? They learned from MtGOX.

I successfully withdrew a small amount to test the waters 1 1/2 hours ago and then tried withdrawing the rest when I got the first two confirmations ... the second withdrawal is now pending for over an hour. Not looking good ...
Edit: After 4h the withdrawal went through. Phew!

He already calls himself "Josh Garza, CEO of PayCoin and BTC", true story. (Because one of his companies is called "Business Technology for Cryptocurrency")

Actually this means that G2Play.net is also accepting bitcoin, which as far as I know is better known than Kinguin (which is basically the same company).
Weird that they don't mention it in the article, it's pretty big news.

MMOGA already accepts Bitcoin:

I successfully withdrew 1 BTC on wednesday and received the first confirmation within 5 minutes. When I withdrew the rest of my balance (~4.7 BTC) it was "pending" for about 4-5 hours, but went through eventually.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:22:48


Yes. This is about buying and selling Bitcoin in exchange for other currencies, not using it as a currency to purchase goods.

I'm aware of what he was alluding to, but what he actually said was factually wrong. The government "makes" the "paper dollars".

Blockchain.info alone has 3m wallets. This may be an inflated number, but I doubt very much that it is by a factor of 10.

From the article you are commenting on:

No, bitcoinity simply doesn't have a "1 year" option, and never had.
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:32:55
I don't know, I'd say G2Play is pretty major, can't name a bigger "unofficial" key seller off the top of my head. Most people just don't know that Kinguin and G2Play are the same company.

Why don't you go ahead and read the article first? There will be no miners.

Depends on where you live. Here in Germany (not certain about other European countries) you don't have to pay taxes on the sale of Bitcoins if you held them for more than a year.

It's an ancient law that's about to be scrapped after this trial. That's pretty much the consensus among all political parties here in Germany, though some would have preferred to scrap it immediately before it could be used against Böhmermann.

Yes, it seems like pure coincidence.

Look again. 10 minutes later and it's at 740. Don't read too much into it.

Of course it's not healthy or normal in traditional markets. But people freak out way too easy when it happens with Bitcoin. For Bitcoin it is (sadly) "normal", and calling it a crash or proclaiming that "the bubble just burst" each time the value drops temporarily is a bit silly. Maybe what I should have said is "don't read too much into it regarding the long-term trend".
