I see. I think I'm visualizing this part of picture better now. Thanks.

A question about this ledger: is it public? Like I could look to see how much somebody else has in some way? Also, I should protect the addresses I generate I take it... How are addreses different from keys or relate to them?

Gotcha. So with these devices will always need a third party website then because those sites act as the exchange. Is there anything else these sites act as? Also, do you feel Bitstash will offer more control over how to handle the currency?

One more question: When selling bitcoin, what is the best way. On that note, what's an example of a 'bad' way or just don't do it senario?

So then is a key like room than that has access to the bitcoin I bought? So I could have multiple keys to the same coin amount, like different doors that open to the same thing?
Edit: And an address is basically me? Like I could have different addresses but it be the same as having like multiple email addresses? There wouldn't be a real point in having more than one or two generally?

So this may sound dumb but bit currency is two sided then? Half is always public and the other half I control, and together I can dictate what happens to that amount? For example, I never have "bitcoin" but rather I have a key (which I purchase) to an amount of bitcoin that stays on the web or an exchange of some sort? So what I purchase is really access to that currency?

I don't know much about bitcoin but as artist/photographer, this is a very interesting idea!

Ok. Now what about Bitstash? Is it like Trezor in that I'm going to use their site, too, if I want to purchase/exchange currency?

What is 'insolvency' and 'solvency proofs'? I'm still new to all this but interested im what's going on.

Gotcha. Solvency proof seems like it should be norm then right? Why wouldn't a company want to show that? It'd seem to create confidence for their customers or at least trust. Seems bitcoin needs trust.

I dont know what you're going on about

Though I agree with you, I think once the Chinese realize theres not one can do with other then hold on to it or use it for remittance I wouldn't be surprised if it dips back to 300-400s again in a month or 2.
