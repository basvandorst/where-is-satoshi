Very good points
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:09:19
Round of applause I enjoyed reading that 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:03:42
Lol.... Trust him, that's what we're all about isn't it?
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:56:25
Go ahead and look at the original comment

@_date: 2016-08-29 03:45:20
I was an still am on my phone. Sorry buddy I'll post MANY example later in the day, one Google search will probably suffice tho
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:48:50


The fact that your average joe, who hates his job and life, will defend these policies is all the indication you need about how likely change is. They love being slaves. None are more hopelessly enslaved then those that falsely believe they are free. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:36:00
I can't agree with you more
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:37:30


Which chain is ja rule supporting tho? I couldnt give a shit what the devs think. ETH violated its core principals, ETC is the rightful continuation of ethereum
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:41:26
R.I.P. migrate to bitstamp if you need an exchange. THIS is why I only kept a TINY amount on any exchange. Ive been through this way to many times we REALLY need a decentralized p2p exchange platform bad! 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:19:05


I have never had any problem with blockchain.info. I use them to watch my paper wallets I dont actually keep Bitcoins on their wallets. Well a tiny amount but still, never had a problem with google auth, withdraw limits, email verification and everything else
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:45:24
Its important for optics. Think of how the corrupt political establishment can use tools such as these to shape a narrative 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:52:31


Its incredible to me how often the community has to make the same mistake before we understand that IF you don't own the private keys, you simply DO NOT own those bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:42:51
This is the saddest response I've ever seen. Ironically sad 
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:25:40
They need to make a much better How To video because I would love to user it but it's confusing. And i came be the only one
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:21:42
Dude not all of us posted legacy addresses. You are aware you could generate wallets en mass right?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:30:10
This will hurt btc 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:09:45
LOL what a year ehh
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:57:08
I see. I feel for you. I guess im just so lost because I never ever keep more then a few tens of dollars worth of bitcoins on any exchange for this very reason. Exchanges currently are implemented as legacy systems. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:24:14


Thats half a million dollars. That would probably change all our lifes lol 
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:56:00
Okay! Go ahead and read the original comment. Took about 5 minutes to find. My guess is you wont read a single article &amp; continue to believe your fairy tales about your freedom. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:02:52
This deserves Reddit silver 
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:35:50


It seems that the ethereum community has fractured between two groups. One group is against the hard fork and they are in ethereum classic, the other group is for the hard fork and remain on the ETH chain 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:19:50


Losing customers and hurting the perception of bitcoin is not cheap, its the opposite of cheap
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:12:51


Also try to understand that there is very many black ops operations on reddit intended to discredit, shift the narrative, obfuscate &amp; plain ole propaganda dissemination. Yes, the herd is still in the stone age intellectually, however, that is partly due to the insane amount of propaganda that we have all been exposed to. 
EDIT: Here is some evidence. I am still astonished that people are f leaks clearly showing it to be true and historical precedence, just sad. It seems some people really dont deserve to be free.
And BTW, this is a TINY sample of the evidence I've accumulated over the years as leaks trickle in or news articles make it into the main stream press. The real question is how much of the gears of subversion are still yet to be uncovered. And lets be honest here, those vigilant reddit posters asking for this evidence arnt going to read a single post because if they really cared they would have done the 5 second google search themselves. Cognitive dissonance is a disease. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:46:14
Why the FUCK would you let a total stranger safe guard that many bitcoins? I hope people learn their lesson, for the 9th time.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:04:18


But then there was a hack so its going to drop further.. Lovely

Welcome to bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:24:23
This would be the absolute worst thing for Bitcoin right now. Hysterical ramblings like those on this thread make me question the rationality around here. The money supply will DRY up over fucking night. Project btc over, project fight for survival against all odds begins 
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:06:32

@_date: 2016-08-03 15:47:23
Holy fuck man. But honestly why why why why keep that many bitcoins on an exchange? Seriously why?!?
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:20:52
Does anyone have ja rules opinion on the matter?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:26:10
Doesn't mean it's secure though; this will hurt btc 
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:33:22
Goodness this is fucking gold!!!
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:08:03










Same. ETH violated its core principal and has ceased to be credible in my mind. ETC is the true chain, the standard of truth for ether
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:19:47


None but people rarely waste a good opportunity to project their insecurities 
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:29:50
Can you explain further and post some sources? I'm asking genuinely I know nothing except the superficial aspects of alt coins 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:30:51
That hit me right in the feels 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:38:02
This 100%. It is time for decentralized exchange platforms. It is past time for this. Clearly we need it, I live projects like OB but clearly there is currently a massive need for a decentralized p2p exchange 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:59:07
Obvious fraud 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:50:04


I couldnt agree more. Right now team you and her need each other. This is not the right move in my opinion. Maybe she is mad because she had more brain power and asked him to take the bitcoins off the exchange and he refused? 
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:15:23
O wow thank you very much for this! Im going to absolutely have to dig through this once im done with my calc
EDIT: I want to give you a tip, what was that tipping service that caught fire here a few months ago?? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:25:47
Tell no one
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:56:14
Go ahead and look at the original comment. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:09:13
Precisely. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:06:51


Exactly. Their market cap is coming from BTC and ETH, not USD
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:53:20
PLEASE add functionality for ETC.
EDIT: When its done, ill start using the wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:46:55
Yes I have but I ended up losing more. Eventually I just became a long term hodler, I only dabble with 40usd worth of Bitcoin for play strictly 
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:44:03
Is this safe and secure?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:26:33
Clearly what we need is a decentralized p2p exchange platform which has no central authority. Bitfinex has the implementation of a legacy system. We need a new type of platform for this new type of asset. If we cant learn this, this will continue to happen till it utterly destroys the reliability of bitcoin in this arena &amp; perhaps in other arenas as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:09:07
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:23:42


Code is law, until its inconvenient. They ruined their immutability for a few million dollars. Utter fools. ETC is now the one true ethereum chain 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:17:07
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:11:04
Massive FUD. Bitfinix was sort of like a brand name exchange state of the art etcetc
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:04:20
ETC will survive since its the ONLY Ether chain which is immutable and the standard for truth 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:37:37
Still kind of pricey when I can just generate off line paper wallets. If the price hits $25-30 ill buy 
@_date: 2016-08-21 21:41:47
It's going to hurt their profits, that's why. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:10:22
It's an impressive fuck up. 75+ million just gone
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:17:38
This is what I am thinking also. A method of subversion for governments scared of losing their monopoly over money is that they may attack bitcoin by hacking it repeatedly until public perception kills bitcon
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:56:43
So so true. Walled gardens are far weaker than open systems
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:16:19
Same. I missed the lowest point but I am really enjoying the discounted coins. We will think back on this during the next halving 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:38:02
That's not for us plebs only for his corporate buddies

@_date: 2018-01-18 16:08:32
I like their wallet but they really need to provide support for all the bitcoin forks and migrate from chrome to other browsers like mozilla/brave/onion
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:51:54
They blocked my transactions as well. Banks are cancer. They are trying to hold on to power. They deserve nothing but the grave

Whether tumblers work is a matter of debate. I would not trust that they do. Further, who will want to tumble hundreds of coins with a centralized service? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:47:43
They are trying to destroy bitcoin since they were not able to co-opt it with segwit2x. Remember how hard they were pushing 2x on us; that code literally crashed before it launch. I will never forget their treachery 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:26:03
I wouldn't want to finance terrorist activity either. This sub has taken on a LOT of water these past few months. Apparently if your a responsible adult you give your gains to a terrorist regime so it can use said funds to further it's terrorist aims. These are what the "adults" of our modern age encourage. Fucking disgusting. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:19:39
I bought his book "Mastering Bitcoin." I never use it because I just go to the github page but I wanted to support his work. I discovered AAs work in 2013 and was glued to my laptop. He was the first person to spark my interest in bitcoin and I cant tell you how many days of my life I spent learning and hearing as much about bitcoin as humanly possible. AA is a legend because of his work and dedication. I can tell you that without AA I wouldnt have got and hodl as hard as I did or as early as I did. I remember watching his testimony to the Canadian senate; gods those were the days. I wanted to sell my car/house/kidney at that moment and buy as many bitcoins as possible but I was poor as fuck. Still managed to get a nice amount though.  
edit: grammar 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:03


Fuck yea man. We were FUCKED by the banksters, corrupt politicians like obama, clinton, bush &amp; trump, and corrupt trade deals. There were NO fucking jobs when I graduated with massive fucking debt. Bitcoin is a MASSIVE middle fingers to those mother fucks

Ver is a mother fucker. Andreas is the shit. I get teary eyes thinking back to 2013 when I first heard andreas speak as a broken in debt college graduate feeling alone and isolated from this fuckimg corrupt system. I felt a sense of hope when Andreas introduced me to bitcoin. A reason to believe in the future and a reason to hodl life itself. Ver has never fucking done anything close to that. Ver is a mother fucker plain and simple. I cant wait till his shit scam coin bcash is fucking obliterated, I just hope he sold all his bitcoins for bcash first.

Very exciting to see bitmains dreams and hopes go through an industrial grade CRUSHER. I want to see scam projects fail. I want to see those that set themselves against us the users fail. Bitmain tried to break bitcoins game theoretical game structure by increasing the block size and therefore reducing its decentralization over the long run. Nope. Get fucking crushed bitmain.

Debatable but what I think is pretty much self evident is that 1 eth should be worth about 1% of a bitcoin - so around .01 per eth. No fucking way im paying close to 3% of a bitcoin for a single mutable uncapped internet token.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:25:09

It feels good to be king. Bitcoin is hard money. Bitcoin is the most immutable object in the universe. Bitcoin is the most scarce object in the universe.

The irony - last I checked they owned a significant amount of bcash. If they attempted to cash out it would surely be noticed and lead to a bcash market panic; it would inevitably crash the price. The price is only as high as it is due to the massive bitmain bcash hording. The bigger they are - the harder they fall.

You range is off. It could be work $0 or $10,000. No one knows. I actally picked up some really cheap BCash and am holding. I left my btc on bittrex so I was able to sell at a high price, used those profits to buy into BCash super low. Will hold on to see what happens. 
One thing I have learned in this space is to expect the unexpected.

You are correct. My comment is only true in theory, however, concretely, its impossible. I would say, generously speaking, no more than 10 million humans will ever own one whole bitcoin. When we read about people finally owning one bitcoin on this forum, just think, that person will most likely be extremely well off in 20 years. We are **FAR** ahead of the curve. We should all be proud of ourselves for our courage to seek the truth &amp; willingness to follow through. I know some are here for the profit, but I am here for the potential to make this planet a FAR better place.

I do actually. I can take my bitcoin anywhere. It could be millions in relic money and I can just casually walk through a boarder no problem. That has tremendous value to me. As well as no one being able to steal them, destroy them, etc etc

So when did you get into crypto; I got in like 5 years ago..... Bingo! 
Its that easy. We all need to be EXTREMELY careful of how we talk to people about our crypto. Now that this is serious money people will want to take what is not theirs because they could not see reality like we could. I say arm yourself and teach them a lesson, leave them without life if possible. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:13:07

Do not allow some corporate shills and sellouts to take this from us. Fight back. Deprive these fucking leeches like coinbase, btcc, bitmain and co of your business.

I couldnt agree more. There needs to be separation between money and government. I think history proves that if you give control of the money supply to a group of people, they will abuse that power. The only way forward is to decentralize money. Keep HODLING and acquiring more. I believe one day each bitcoin will be worth millions and millions of dollars. There are not enough bitcoins for every millionaire/billionaire to own an entire one.

@_date: 2017-10-26 20:08:52


What if coinbase &amp; co. label B2X as BTC though? What would this do?
From what I understand; and correct me if I am wrong, Chinese mining cartels will mine B2X. Therefore, odds are, the B2X chain will be producing blocks more or less within 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the BTC chain will be left with a difficulty as if everyone was still mining it. Coinbase will use these circumstances to potentially declare B2X the winner, thus increasing its value. In theory, if the original chain stagnates and no longer is producing blocks, its value will fall.
If coinbase &amp; co decide to label B2X as BTC, what recourse do we have? I am concerned about this and even more concerned that I am not seeing any plans being drawn up to prevent bitcoins centralized middlemen from taking over the code base. 
I believe there is nothing worse than having bankers and their puppets in control of the code and its direction. Im concerned we will see the centralization of bitcoin in much the same fashion we have seen with the internet. What is the plan to prevent this?

It is an unfortunate reality in which we live. I hate the fact that I have to stay armed and diligent but the reality which we happen to occupy is such that this behavior is required to keep what you have. History has shown again and again that people will take what is yours if they believe you are easy prey. If bitcoin ever hits big league numbers than you can bet that every nocoiner idiot who currently (or has been) entirely ignorant about the space will want in on some action. I took all the risk, I did all the research, I hodl'ed for years; if someone tries to take this from me; they better come heavily armed and ready to die. I hope other bitcoiners take this attitude as well. As soon as these pathetic scum start dying in these robberies; they will think twice.

The banks are restricting access to crypto under the guise of protecting consumers and the sheep buy it up because apparently crypto is risky but owning bonds from a government trillions in debt isn't... .

Excellent strawman. Goes to show how deeply propagandized people can become. You sound like the type of person that is deeply repulsed by evidence &amp; reason so I'm writing this for others who happen to stumble upon this thread.
The US is asserting it's moral authority by being the world's police at no one's beheat, for the betterment of the world. The US; after having laid wasted to the middle east, has found a new playground for it's advanced armaments. Incredible how US might can be marshalled on the battlefield; yet it's children are drinking posianous leaded water, bridges are collapsing, massive drug epidemic, largest prison population and generally a lost population being crushed under massive debt. The US has been waging illegal war in the middle east for 17 years now. Ask yourself if Assad, as a matter of strategy, on the verge of victory, would gas his own people? It makes zero sense. The hopeless pathetic sheep who I am replying too attempts to equate the fact that Assad is a monsterous person with the strategy of the Syrian state. There is nothing for Syria to gain from this. Only through the eyes of a pathetic sheep can this reality be something other than obvious.

I cant agree more. My terrorist regime has been statistically proven to be an Oligarchy. It has long abandoned the will of the people and instead is run for and by the .01%. I get taxed at a rate of about 40% income, and on every single item I purchase. The terrorist state I happen to be born into currently is waging illegal terrorist wars for control &amp; power. My class pay their taxes but have no say or control over the political process in any statistically meaningful way. The might of my terrorist regime can be marshaled on the battlefield in less than a few days but is unable to fix its failing &amp; crumbling infrastructure, unable to prevent its children from drinking poisonous water, unable to provide even the most basic health care or workers rights, has the worlds largest prison population and all in all being crushed by massive mountain of debt. Crypto is my life jacket and I wont be handing that to terrorist.

Dont pretend like your straw man argument is what I am saying. There is a mining monopoly which must be broken up, as they present a clear and present danger to Bitcoin. Mining must become far more decentralized so that no one mining group/organization can ever delay or exert unwarranted power over Bitcoin development ever again. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:42:40


This constitutes an attack on the network and should be dealt with as such. They are trying to protect their ill-gotten advantage at the detriment of the entire community. We need to end this with a UASF. Lets see them sink with their shit alt-coin, nothing will give me more satisfaction right now

I'm 100% on board. The mining cartel has attacked the network for long enough. We must reduce them to rubble for attempting to warp and control Bitcoin. Noone is bigger then Bitcoin, the miners will learn this. UASF is LESS dangerous then allowing jihan and co to continue to attack the network

I can't agree more. It's incredibly depressing that so many people seem to believe that a 20 usd transactions are acceptable or good.

It's sad I only hold for profit now when I want to hold for my original purpose, to radically change the planet for everyone on the planet, not only those that can afford to send transactions for high fees to a centralized mining cartel.

A  is a way for the community of Bitcoin users to come together to defends against the attacks from jihans CENTRALIZED MINING CARTEL. We cannot allow this to exist in any form in Bitcoin. The game theory incentive structure of Bitcoin is under attack because the cartel has aquired such power that it is now stalling/repealing upgrades to our network. The system has built in protection against this, US. We must come together and fight back with a  - we have waited long enough! How many millions has jihan and his cartel made already from 2 years of stalling? How many more mining operations is he going to have to buy up?

Do not underestimate the coercive power of Bitmain. They are a massive centralized monopoly.

I just paid a 2 USD fee to move half a bitcoin to a nano S. INcredible some people seem to be okay with this. One of the main things that attracted me to bitcoin was it near free transaction capabilities. That made me consider moving into other coins very strongly. I wondered if that was the first time I had ever used bitcoin would I have been as captured and impressed with it as I was years ago? The answer is a definite no. Its disgusting how some people seem to think this type of fee structure is okay/good for bitcoin.

The forces of centralization have attempted to isolate our great developers, who's excellent work is the main reason why the owners of the CENTRALIZED services even have a business model to rely on. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Keep the pressure up with a UASF. These leeches will stop at NOTHING for their own preservation and profit.

The hype idol worship machine ETH will never embody what Bitcoin is. There is a reason why bitcoin doesnt have massive multinational banks advising it or on a private chain which is somehow part of bitcoin like ETH does. Large multinational corporations see ETH as something they can control and mold, bitcoin is not that. This massive hype bubble we are in might be an attack by the oligarchs to attempt to destroy bitcoin, the one coin that has the potential to free humanity from their grasp.

I am so tired of coinbase "going down" every single time there is a great buying opportunity. At this point I can safely say that for vets coinbase is utterly garbage. Its for newbies who are getting their toes wet at best.
Of course, that says absolutely nothing about the FACT that coinbase is becoming paypal2.0 and is a hostage to the terrorist organization known as the US government. I can easily see a future in which the US gov has entirely co-opted coinbase and has a record of everyone who has ever used it and where/how they use their bitcoins. Make no mistake, that IS coming if it hasnt already.

If UASF doesnt work I will dump every single satoshi I have. I am fucking tired of these disgusting leeches that have grown around bitcoin. Centralized exchanges and centralized mining have harmed bitcoin greatly. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:36:04
AUG 1st is bitcoin liberation day. If ChinaCoin~~JihanCoin~~ and PayPal2.0Coin~~BarryCoin~~ decide to fuck us, we WILL go through with our improvement of bitcoin. Of this there is NO doubt. 
The forces of centralization have bickered back and forth for years now, meanwhile our amazing and talented developers and us the users; the only reason why PayPal2.0Coin and ChinaCoin have a business model to begin with, have been left out in the cold. Its disgusting that the forces of centralization have determined that they do not need our developers or user input when deciding among themselves the direction of OUR project. Just like the oligarchs which run our financial system today ONLY for the benefit of themselves, seeking neither approval or recommendation from the rabble; here today, PayPal2.0Coin and ChinaCoin seeks to circumvent us the users &amp; our developers. This is unacceptable and we will send them a message they cannot ignore August 1st.

Make no mistake, we are at a cross roads. The danger is great and the forces of centralization have grown in power. We MUST maintain our united front with a UASF. We are pushing bitcoin in the right direction. Look at how multinational corporations like terrorist banks (the ones that help drug cartels/crashed the global economy/foreclosed on millions of people) are crowding ETH, they see bitcoin as a massive threat and will try to destroy us by any means necessary. They cannot mold us, they cannot control us. We must continue to resist and push for a UASF

Coinbase is a leech on the community. They are a centralized exchange granting all its user info to the US government. We must innovate them out of existence. This whole scaling debate has reduced us overall and really hurt us. I am ready for UASF, if that fails I am out. Ive been holding for YEARS and years but I have never felt like I was only holding for profit, now I am feeling that way. Where is the innovation? Its all FUD now, with centralized exchanges and centralized mining. Its looking like fucking garbage now. I will dump all my coins if UASF fails

Coinbase cooperates with the terrorist organization known as the US government. If you use coinbase know that EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION you make will be monitored by "the land of the free home of the brave." 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:36:41


Not really. Fees which eliminate a significant amount of use cases and billions of people means bitcoin is destined to fail. Further, mining centralization is a growing cancer. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:30:00

Barrycoin is essentially an attempt by the forces of centralization to maintain control over the direction of bitcoin. They didnt come to the community or our developers for approval or suggestions. Its time for a UASF and time to crush the forces of centralization 
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:48:19
Why not both?

Bitmain is running scared AF. They can mine Jihan/ChinaCoin as long as they want. I hope they run their business into the ground doing so. Mining centralization has been a growing cancer, and its gotten bad enough to delay upgrades for TWO ENTIRE YEARS. This is unacceptable. I didnt support UASF at first but now I see its the only way to move bitcoin forward. No one said this would be without risk. I think the biggest risk is allowing bitcoin to be dominated by the Chinese government aka bitmain
