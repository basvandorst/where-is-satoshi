A bit off topic but hoping you or someone can help me; I mined some Doge 3 or 4 years ago and had the wallet in the Dogecoin-qt. I tried downloading the most updated wallet but it's not syncing so I can't see how many coins I have. Do you have any recommendations?

I may be misunderstanding, but I don't think a global option would be good as it then makes all content the same priority. e.g I could set a low cent/GB ratio for older content that every one is sharing, or I can set a high cent/GB ratio for fresh content that people are willing to pay a bit more for to get faster. Just like bedeho explained in the comment above

I think you are underestimating the costs and logistics of this. If they pay £50,000 a year in ransom, thats less than it costs to pay a small IT team to do daily backups of servers. This is with out the actual cost of hardware and backup location too.

Are people not using localbtc any more? Or just not recommending it to new people?

I don't think any one person did it. Bitcoin.org is an authority website and Google rewards that. Check the [backlinks]( and you'll see its been linked to thousands of times. Authority website + thousands of links = high rankings

The presenters voice is quite annoying.
Maybe I've missed it, but where does the money come from for the content creators? E.g on YT the uploader gets money from AD revenue, is it the same for megaupload 2 and bitcache?

Why isn't it correct?
