What is going on with the Y axis here? 500 to 700 is smaller than 200 to 300. Is it some sort of log (or pseudo-log) scale with weird labels?

So rather than adjusting the data values themselves for inflation, you adjust the Y axis? 
I'm pretty sure that is not the right way to adjust for inflation since it's time varying, which means you would need a different Y axis for every x value (assuming x is time as labelled).

I didn't mean to imply that you had. I'm just saying that I don't understand what the graph's purpose is with my reasons. :)

It would be more like Apple naming their computers "Hard Drives." Then when someone asks if you've seen the new hard drive, you'd have to specify whether you are talking about the hard drive, or the hard drive inside the hard drive.

Haha, that is terrible, but now that you mention it, I have heard that terminology used... We should just call every thing a widget. That way we don't need other words and everything can be understood through context alone.

I'd like more information on this. Where do I find an investment with 10% yearly gains? I've got way too much sitting in a "hoarding" account and I want better returns than they give to hoarders.

Your link draws the same conclusion that I did listening to the Mad Money interview. The link and title in this thread however are extremely misleading. 
My interpretation is that he said that GPUs helped crypto currency grow, but that it wasn’t part of NVIDIA’s primary business or market. Even the OP’s link mentions that at the end of the article. It seems they chose the title to be more sensationalist and not in an effort to accurately represent the interview.

Reading through their FAQ, I believe the SSN requirement was added in Feb 2013, and you can contact support to get them to send any money that was in there before to a bank account.

How do you have all those hats?

I bet you're not mining enough to pay for the extra cooling costs.

In my opinion, this is the primary challenge with bitcoins for kickstarter (and other currencies). Each kickstarter project uses one kind of currency, and people pay in that currency when they contribute to the project. I think very few kickstarter projects would want to collect bitcoins as their currency.

Some people don't actually want to use bitcoins for transactions and are just riding the wave to gain "real" money.
