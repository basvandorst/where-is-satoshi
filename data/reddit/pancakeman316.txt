Without knowing the insurance company, how is there any way to verify that the coins are actually insured, and what the conditions are within that insurance agreement.
I could have my grandma promise to insure up to 10mBIT...then publish "coins are insured"

Am I the only one unimpressed with this?  You just create a new menu item called "The Vault" with a couple of additional security settings, but the coins stored in the exact same manner, and this is somehow akin to real cold storage of your own keys?  IMHO it a bastardization of real Bitcoin security.  You even drop a few "Multisig" keywords in to make it seem legit...

The GHash/CEX part in the video was out of place and chingeworthy but if they produced or funded the video they deserve some kind of credit for it.

The part i find off putting is that they edited out the insurer but did not update the "Last Updated" date either.
Basically by removing the insurer this could mean the guarantee is now not more than them saying "We'll try not to lose the money"...which is a lot different than being underwritten by an actual insurance company.
Certainly qualifies as an "Update" i think.

Almost like the kind of commits you'd make just to get your name on something...to give yourself some cred..."Hey I worked on Bitcoin Core...*(adding periods at the end of sentences)*"
