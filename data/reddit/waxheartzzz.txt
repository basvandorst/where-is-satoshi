i like how you post this 18 minutes ago, after the drop... what will your response be when we are at 12,600 tonight / tomorrow again?

11600 is an insane buy point given its proven multiple times it will go to 13k+
what more do you need? a neon sign and a megaphone yelling in your ear?

i just try to give some light to all the illogical negative fud
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:26:12
No, not at all. The small % of the dip that could be attributed to that is basically offset by the fact people were having trouble selling too, so I would say &lt;5% of the dip was due to that.
Dip was just expected if you look at any investment... people who want to cut their losses or have purchases to make outside the market and saw this as a good selling point. The dip was clearly an OVER correction though, in response to the asset accelerating too fast (people selling alts and jumping on btc train)
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:30:43
If what ive been saying is right, there was the 11,300 (i guess it went a little further) few minute touch and i would expect it to go back up now

The money to be had is switching between btc and alts at the right times
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:07:33
What? I have been pretty spot on so far if it gets to 12600 today.. I said 11300 is the bottom and it wouldn't stay there long, and then we get 12600 by last night or today

You are waiting for a scenario that would literally be the collapse of the world... people pay rent with their 30% or their income. You are describing a scenario where noone has income?
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:03:13
Yeah! My predictions are always plus or minus 2 days, still seeing same thing 12600 today or tomortow
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:46:33

@_date: 2019-07-17 15:34:33
i believe we will reach 35k in 2019, and in 2020 we will reach 30k
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:13:21
I always think about the world in the perspective of goods... the world is producing far more now than years ago, and the automation wave will keep that increasing.  
Lower income people used to live in 800 sq feet homes and now they live in 1400 plus. Lower income families have TVs, xboxes, computers...
I keep hearing that income has decreased or stayed the same but it's just not true. Inequality doesn't really matter if we're all getting richer. 
Automation is extremely interesting, as we will reach a point where goods aren't made in developing countries,  instead of labor being the driving factor due to cost, security of the machines will be most important due to no labor cost.

huge upside, low downside
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:55:11
I mean today you saw bsv pop which was the one that had the biggest dip
Next would be ethereum to recover. Certain ones are more correlated. Eth and btc moving together a lot I expect eth to be a good pick in the next cpl days
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:52:49
and yet we were right back in 13k within weeks
we will be blasting through to 15k very soon, what would your response be to that in the event it comes true?

@_date: 2019-07-09 14:57:49
YES, WAY more upside than downside... we are not dipping below 11,600 again and potential upside to 15k in the next week... 19k in a month
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:54:18
but if everyone knows it will pop after, they will invest now, not later
that is why history wont repeat... lol

We will see! So far within 100ish of the bottom, legendary. I have 12600 by end of the day  to be fully right, but usually I have a 2 day confidence interval 
If 12600 today then my prediction was next level

@_date: 2019-07-09 14:54:45
it will beat ATH, but people will want to sell @ this price scared of bear market, so it will dip and stay around 15k for awhile, then it will slowly push all the way to 30-40k near march 2020. then it will trade sideways all 2020
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:53:45
No, 15k in july
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:41:07
Nope! And check post history! I called the final dip below 8k and that we weren't going there again
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:49:46
you are very close, 11600 to 11800 is the bottom, maybe 11300 but it would only be for a second... we are going right back to 12,600 either tonight or tomorrow
we are going to see ATH by august, maybe even july. In nov the 30-40k price point that we will see and then bear market close to early dec
then sideways most of 2020
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:55:11
yeah, i was watching closely to see if we got to 13400, i was a little spooked by how long we held just above 13k (13k to 13.1k). I am nearing a closing where i need some cash so it was wise to not chase any higher returns

Right here... 11.6k to 11.8k is the bottom... we are jumping right back to 12,600 by tonight.

there is so much research on this: if you give someone extra money, they will find a way to spend it
you can easily see this in tax return increases not affecting the national savings rate.... people just end up using that money to buy more shoes, beer, ice cream, and other pointless things... it's just flat out wrong to assert the value of discretionary spending is not ever increasing
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:40:57
I see us going a little lower and january being a big month... 4-6k low (intentionally wide b/c i have no idea), back to around 7-9k in jnauary and up from there
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:30:24
Well I know a lot of players were expecting 6 month until halving to be a catalyst of further gains / fomo, a lot of others and myself included sold hard at 8700ish after it was clear there was no ramp up to the 6month mark. There is no foreseeable catalyst until early jan so we will see a sideways downturn until then!
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:33:04

Decent chance that btc will be the winner there too but noone knows

Yeah, this was an older model that had us touching ath this year.

Good news is my new bottom is 6900 to 7100 for this bear
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:28:45
It has to do with the true low of bitcoin on my model... 7k is the true bottom, 3k was severe overcorrection

I personally have 6900 to 7100 as the bottom... that is when I get to reenter the crypto market! Been out for a couple months when I realized ATH is coming in 2020 and not 2019

It will go to 6k and probably reach 6250\~ and then settle around 6100 mark for a bit. This will all happen by EOD Sunday.
7k is ALSO happening in May. 10k in june is possible but there will be some series volatility if we get to that level that fast
