The law doesn't look kindly upon "loopholes". As in, if you call yourself a bakery but you don't actually deliver any baked goods, but instead act suspiciously more like an exchange, it doesn't matter what "good faith effort" you put in in the short term, it's about the overall broad picture. And when 100% of your customers get refunds, there's no great justification unless you had 1 customer.

I've come around on Bitcoin (I believed it had no future in 2011, I was wrong), but I am very skeptical as to the current "price" of a Bitcoin right now on MtGox.
MtGox is in legal trouble with the United States, and one of it's biggest sources of financing accounts (Dwolla) gets stopped by the US Government. It also controls ~70% of Bitcoin trade.
When things like this happen, you'd expect the price to drop from these two factors (Edit: :
* (Edit: whoops, had this reversed as pointed out. Getting money out into bitcoins would drive the price up, as people would want to transfer out money as soon as possible, meaning they'd want to pay *more* to get ahead of the bid wall)
* Once people have transfered their liquid (dollar) assets into Bitcoins and out of the MtGox economy (to some other brokerage, or just some wallet somewhere), what we are left is less dollar assets than before (and much harder to get money in with Dwolla being closed), but a bitcoin price that's stayed the same. I feel like when there is an abundance of one thing (bitcoins) but a lack of abundance of another thing (dollars), supply and demand would mean that the price would be driven lower to get attention of the minimum dollars available in the economy. Yet, that's not what happened.

To be clear though, using bitinstant gives you USD for MtGox, it doesn't translate it over to bitcoins, right?

Seriously? I don't even have to look into my history that far to see that I posted at least 5 months ago *in this subreddit*
Even in that comment, I mention I've been watching it since 2011. But I bet you felt really cool typing out that comment.

I disagree in a sense -- there's always been optimism as the price has grown, but lately it's been nothing *but* optimism, a lot of people thinking the price is going to rise 3-5x from where it is now, and almost daily articles about the price.
I'd describe it almost at a frenzy -- and I remember vividly the last frenzy and the accompanying "hangover".
EDIT: I'm not saying bitcoin is coming crashing down in the next month -- for all I know it is headed to $1000. All I'm saying is that if you are investing, don't invest more than you can afford. And that whenever a positive article about BTC comes out, or the price of BTC raises another $10, we make sure to realize that it could all disappear in an instant, and we need to be ok with that.

I've thought about your comment for awhile as the price has kept going up and up, and I thought there was _no way_ that it would hit $750 -- I was wrong.
Any thoughts now that the price has reached the number you predicted a month ago?

I feel like there should be a version of "Hanlon's razor" that states that you should never attribute to intelligence that which can equally be attributed to stupidity.

Ah, that makes so much sense now.

To be honest, I trust MtGox more than a lot of the other players out there.
* They are one of the few exchanges that are still standing after so many years (other ones closed down after hacks/scams/etc).
* Although they've been hacked before (2011), they still seem to have more security features than any exchange I've seen (2 factor for logging in, accessing security panel, etc). The fact that they haven't been hacked in 2 years also gives them some kudos -- you have to figure any hacker who wants to make off with a ton of BTC will target MtGox, yet they haven't had another loss (I think -- correct me if I'm wrong).
* They handle a lot of volume. This might not be a big deal in itself, but at any time they could probably easily run off with a shit-ton of Bitcoins and be set for life, but they don't. Maybe they are playing the long con, but I have a feeling it's much more profitable in the long run to take a percentage fee off of every trade and be legitimate.
What "A" player exchanges are there out now though? It seems like a new Bitcoin exchange pops up every day, but I'm not going to trust some nobody to handle my BTC as is it is still very much the wild west out there. I need a website with HTTPS, 2 factor security, that can handle big volume and is run by someone or some company I can trust. Even with those being true, we've seen a lot of the "Big Name" Bitcoin companies out there fall to hacks/other stuff (Bitfloor comes to mind off the top of my head).

Ah! For the first point, I think I was reversed then. I could see people driving the Bitcoin price up, because when you need to get your money out, you want to convert it to bitcoin to transfer to another wallet, which will mean you will most likely not want to wait, and will pay above the market price. Do this enough times and the price slips upwards. Alright, I can buy that.
But now that most of the people have moved their money out, if they want to transfer it back into Dollars, isn't MtGox still the way to do it since it commands most of the volume? In which case now you have less dollars to buy those Bitcoins back (since everyone moved their money out and into Bitcoins) meaning trying to sell them would drive the price lower?

I'm not talking to the whales -- I'm talking to the Redditors who stop by bitcoin, see nothing but optimism, decided to put some money in (maybe more than they can afford), and experience what users did a few months ago when it "popped". I'm trying to be a voice of dissent in what is increasingly being a fervent roar over Bitcoin.
You say all it takes is a basic understanding of supply/demand dynamics in order to figure out if an investment is savvy. Do you think the average user in this subreddit does? What about an average redditor that just stops by? Are critiques of the price of bitcoin being upvoted, or is it constantly only good things posted?
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:37:33
Yes -- since bitcoin is a currency and is bought and sold much like a stock on a stock market, hearing about its "Black Friday" made me worried I would go check MtGox only to see the price at $2 or something.

I don't think I've ever heard the words "starter supercar" in my life. I'm still working on having a "starter car"!
Ah, to be rich.

This is pretty good, but a few things to note:
the time choosing seems broken: Choose 1W (1 week), it shows you everything. 1D shows ~ 1 year. 6hr is 1 month, 1H is 1 Week, 15M is 1 day, etc.
Also, the site is horrifically unresponsive (resize the browser window).

My post is a way to combat groupthink -- which is when group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.
The more rational and tempered response we have to bitcoin, the more rational we will be with it's outcome. I'm hoping it starts with my post, but continues on into other conversations.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:13:45
I'm getting somewhat worried. Too many articles are coming out praising Bitcoin, and people are starting to get crazy like what happened during the the last crash (It's going to hit $1000! I just sold X to buy bitcoins!).
I feel like within a month or two we will have a crash back down to ~$120. I'm not so sure enough that I'd bet on my prediction, but I've been a huge proponent of bitcoin, and even I'm getting nervous by these prices.

It's really easy to create negative buzz about new technologies,  since the public is skeptical, and most times the person writing will be right (Notable exceptions in the past 10 years: "No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.", "Apple should pull the plug on the iPhone… [because it is just] going to be another phone in a crowded market.", etc).
People want technologies they aren't invested in to fail, because if they do, they can support their decision to do so -- nobody wants to be on the wrong side of profitable decision.
That being said, it probably helps to balance a lot of hype users are pushing out about it -- I just remember the hype on right before the fall being almost cringeworthy.
