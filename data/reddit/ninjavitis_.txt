I'm not doubting that it's ever happened. I'm just saying that I haven't read any posts, articles, or interviews about people doing it. Are these people you know personally? Can you tell me about how and when they got in and out of BTC?

All the participants as a collective are creating it. All the buyers would have to put their money on the line push it up to $1000. A small group isn't going to do that, they'd just be throwing their money away.

If I walk into a used car dealership and offer to pay $100k above the asking price for a certain car does that make all comparable cars worth $100k more for a brief period of time?

No no, I don't think it's a ponzi scheme. It's not organised like that. A bubble occasionally, but that's different from a pyramid. I just think the exchanges might be less reliable than people think.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:20:53
The point is you don't know. You have no proof either way. The owners of the dealership might have just held the bitcoins as speculation.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:09:35
Interesting. So by having a relatively low limit on selling and no limit on buying that must affect the price of bitcoin. Also if these companies were solvent and well funded, shouldn't they have a higher limit?
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:08:48
Bitcoin was still designed and implemented by people. Decentralized does not mean it exists independent of people and stakeholders, theres no AI. It's still being used to make money for a select group of people. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:42:12
Dollars are currency. But most people don't throw change at each other in social forums. This doesn't help bitcoin at all. Buy shit and build infrastructure if you want it to succeed. Doge is on its way out as a meme and the coin wont last much longer once its gone. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:17:40
Yes, that is how exchanges should work assuming they are being run by competent and experienced professionals.
But do you really think they can resist dipping into some of that deposited fiat to pay for expenses, using it as an interest free bridging loan/emergency fund? What do you think they are doing with the cash people deposit into them when an unexpected problem comes up? It doesn't take much for them to fuck up their finances, they just have to promise themselves that they will pay it back once they earn it in fees.

@_date: 2013-12-07 04:24:03
It is really amazing. The closest paradigm to bitcoin I can imagine is email.
Think of the first few thousand people with email addresses. They had to pay for those and there was hardly anyone else to correspond with. It wasn't user friendly, or easy to set up, but the idea of an unlimited, nearly instant, global messaging protocol was fresh and exciting. That's exactly how it feels to send and receive bitcoins, it's like emailing money.
Back when there was only command-line interface email people would have said the same thing about email that doubters are saying about bitcoin, and they'd have been right. Regular people would not have treated it as a form of communication on par with faxes, telephones, and letters. Why pay for and set up an email sever that you have to connect to with dial-up when you can just press a button on a plug-and-play fax machine? But then it went from early adopters to widespread adoption once it became easy and user friendly.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:33:22
Considering the shoddy systems we have at the exchanges, it's like using real money to beta-test a platform.

I see no way in which he could have profited from that, aside from brief satisfaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:22:06
Sorry, I forgot to add quotes. I was trying to make fun of you for basically saying that about OP. I think OP has pretty good reasons to advise people not to use Mt.Gox. Why would you rudely dismiss his right to express himself? Are you really so hateful that you feel the need to kick people when they've just lost a great deal of money?
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:57:28
Wait what? Unless your altcoins lost half their value in bitcoins or 75% of their value in USD...
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:33:47
Damn, he rustled quite a few jimmies. Ah well, winning at trolling is still losing.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:44:42
Exactly. This isn't even about bitcoin. I'm sure they have a "no giant QR codes" policy.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:03:34
Show me where he tells everyone never to use mt gox. All he says is he shouldn't have trusted them with his money, by which he means leaving it in his trading account instead moving it to a secure wallet. Which is true! You shouldn't trust them as bitcoin storage. 
Aside from that, this part made me not want to use them: "There has been a withdrawal from your Mt.Gox account: ... Please contact us as soon as possible by replying to this email if you did not request this withdrawal."
"Sorry we can't actually help you."
That kind of message makes it sound like you can actually do something, that its not too late, that Mt Gox cares. Then, when you have some hope and you're at your most vulnerable, they take 9 hours to respond and tell you that there was nothing they were going to do anyways.  That's shitty. Can you imagine what that would feel like emotionally? Also plenty of people on have reported getting robbed even with 2FA on. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:05:06
Why would you want to do that? There's plenty of lost bitcoins out there. I've heard estimates as high as 1/3rd of all bitcoins are inaccessible due to early miners loosing their keys. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:29:42
I'm also Canadian. Ever since libertybit closed I've just been using Cavirtex and Bitfinex. I wish I could sell for the higher prices on Gox but who knows how long it would take to get that money back.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:03:06
I think it will stabilize at around 300-400. It might dip into the 200s briefly. That would be a good time to buy in I think.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:46:48
I can't think of a better way to protect the blockchain. The more money to be had from exploiting it, the more protection is needed. I felt it was wasteful too. But then I remembered that A) there were incentives for individual miners to keep waste to a minimum (e.g. use low cost hydro power, maintain/recycle their mining equiptment) and B) It's way less wasteful than printing paper money.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:36:47
Yeah most people on here have probably never heard of the bitcointalk forums.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:35:14
If you wanted rational discussion of Bitcoins you should go to the bitcointalk forums. If you're on here I'm just going to assume you enjoy memes and shitposts.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:38:51
You enter a USD amount for the trail. So a $10 on a buy would be if the price went down, reversed and went back up by $10 from the lowest point, you'd buy on the upswing. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:24:18
Due to all the slippage, delays and hassles, $1039 on Bitstamp is worth about the same as $1172 on Gox.

@_date: 2013-12-08 04:23:53
No need to take it personally dude. I get that most miners are early adopters and are well in the black. I was just asking a hypothetical question since there were probably some newer miners who took out loans to pre-order overpriced ASICS that got delivered late. I assume those people are in a tight spot right now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:48:19
I'm not convinced about that part yet.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:21:51
It will probably be boring when we're all using Bitcoin 2.0 and only a few hipsters are still playing with the old buggy Bitcoin 1.0 that was used to beta-test the concept.

You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.

exactly, if it was easy we'd all be doing it. As it stands, moving fiat money in an out of exchanges is a huge hassle. Exchanges with lower BTC prices usually reflect greater difficulty in withdrawing money or lower volume.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:12:29
This is the correct financial strategy. But it only holds true for miners that are hoarding their coins and can afford to wait for the price to recover.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:21:17
Or accredited investor-like losses! Oh wait, they can absorb those losses but you can't.

Edit:

@_date: 2013-12-18 11:01:27
you could have just held onto them for a few months and sold when the price went back up. Personally, I'd only sell if I plan to buy in again at the bottom at least as many BTC as I had before.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:14:48
I kind of like that no government can change the rules of bitcoin on the fly. I think a government backed digital dollar could be very successful. But I don't think we'd all give up on bitcoin just because there was an alternative.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:40:16
A poorly executed hard fork perhaps? Or a controversial update that divides the community could do it. I don't really know enough about cryptography but is it possible that some important future features might not be compatible with the existing public ledger?
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:45:05
It's out of context to assume that the total value of Bitcoin would stay at $9b after a 51% attack. If that happened, or if someone could outright steal bitcoins, the price would crash and attacker probably wouldn't recoup their investment. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:43:05
Actually yes, I believe fans are not allowed to to bring in giant QR codes regardless of whether it's for bitcoin, coupons, or advertisement. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:44:35
Only if they time the market just right and buy back in. It's so easy to sell at the lowest point.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:42:34
So the guy raises valid criticism of Gox protocols. You don't like sending cash to a centralized processor probably for some of the same reasons. And yet you berate him and call it anti gox propaganda even though he admitted he was at fault for his loss?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:45:25
Most alt coins are (for some inexplicable reason) pegged to the price of bitcoin. I think they're even more speculative than BTC. At least you can buy stuff with Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:08:09
Your math is taken out of context. If a nefarious agent took control of the blockchain people would just say fuck it and walk away. The "value" of a bitcoin (really the exchange rate in USD) is only what buyers are willing to pay for one.
No one would pay money for a stolen corrupted bitcoin if you knew a thief had control of the public ledger. All they would profit would be to wipe out the current blockchain. Chances are the rest of us would just roll back the history by one block and start over again.
Furthermore, I think there is more than enough processing power to protect the network for right now.

Shady back alley. Dude with shifty eyes opens up his trench coat with a bunch of QR codes sewn into the liner...
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:40:48
That company is not in the business of taking speculative risks. They are in the business of renting processing power and accepting risk free CASH up front.
