nice, you took pictures of cryptos on a pullback. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:57:17
The mainstream media hardly knows anything about anything. constant fake news and fear/outrage mongering.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:02:03
it will hit 100k soon
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:30:32
pretty much all price action is unpredictable or else we would all be rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:40:13
I feel like at this point the weak hands have already been shook and all that is left is true hodlers
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:00:52
is it over?
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:04:45
let them sell at a bottom and regret it later.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:54:49
I mean coinbase has a phone app.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:30:23
yup. just focus more long term on the tech. not the day to day price. it will go up way beyond what it is now in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:57:30
I see nothing but good news for BTC but price dropping hard even after last weeks crash smh.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:18:31
both are great
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:28:52
its fake. whales playing games
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:10:58
what happens to bitcoin when the US financial market crashes? To me it would make since that it would go up but I have seen other say the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:05:34
got anymore crystal balls?
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:26:38
panic selling from initial fud. now that its over and the weak hands are out it might be done.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:45:58
yup headed back down now for a bit. the volatility is crazy no telling where this is going. my guess would overall be up though.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:29:45
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:20:01
yes about two weeks until they trade again.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:07:14
news doesn't rise the price. adoption and buyers do. And there has been an increase in adoption the past two years and will more likely continue that way as pandoras box has been opened on the crypto space. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:14:46
I would tidy up your mom before questioning the intelligence of others.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:50:58
got any more crystal balls for the rest of us?
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:21:58
whats bad about it iv seen some stuff but not sure what the deal is
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:28:42
i am joking here guys
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:28:43
HODL on then we shall
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:24:19
all it takes is one decent push where people don't panic sell at the slight sign FUD then it becomes a bolder rolling down a hill that can't be stopped. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:56:14
I mean like how much causes the price to move 1%? for example if the price was flat then someone bought X amount how much would cause it to move that much?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:45:50
who ever made this deserves a cookie.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:08:46
If you do any research on a bitcoin bubble you will see people have been saying this shit for years and years. Just google bitcoin bubble chart are most of the stuff is from like 4 years ago. now look at it. 
It is not a bubble but an S curve adoption of a new technology that grows with how many people use it and how useful it become in society which will only grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:36:12
Two big reasons are that is has been battle tested and survived many hard attacks on it and still continues to rise. Two is the brand in that when business start to accept crypto the first one they know of is bitcoin as most people who know anything about crypto only know bitcoin. Bitcoin also is pretty much fixing the transfer fees and speed with lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:50:16
my guess a couple weeks or so or less
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:10:33
more keys = better tech come on now bruh
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:18:50
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:50:10
how many bitcoins would it take to move the market 1%?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:17:38
It was a ponzi scheme and it shut down. people lost all their $$
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:12:00
how long do you guys think this bear market will last? just wondering peoples options, please no dumb answers.

someone explain dollar cost averaging to me.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:42:32
How much does the average crypto investor have in the market right now? Any guesses?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:33:00
is it just me or does the depth chart mean literally nothing? I just see the price just blow through huge walls on the either side like it doesn't exist.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:09:35
I see some saying this is normal correction but for real how bad is this? what do you guys think?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:59:32
hey i mean relative to where it is now. but idk we on the way now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:31:21
that is the approximate support level and yeah maybe but know knows. I would just buy anytime during this dip and hold for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:17:49
it will never go to $1.20. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:41:00
buy walls mean nothing anymore
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:48:58
sorry. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:19:47
not saying it is useless I am just saying that right now I wouldn't use it for monetary transactions because of its volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:53:34
best strat
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:18:37
crypto or just bitcoins cap? also I think cryptos could exceed golds cap.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:17:15
I swear the whales are just getting each other rich by inducing panic selling and panic buying by people and just scooping up the profits. This volatility is crazy
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:00
this is why we HODL. sorry if you sold at 10k. your lesson is now learned
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:19:31
some please post the rusts of this if they come out
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:38:15
why would it drop again? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:18:07
calling the bottom at 8,400 then moon shot up about 50%
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:02:51
so you are saying the true early adopters will be the first to actually use it as a currency to by stuff?
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:06:20
a bolder can't gain momentum going up a hill m8. thats physics. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:47:01
how much control do whale have over this market? i fell like some people are just playing around with people on those buy and sell walls. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:18:41
you are looking at the past few weeks. weak hands will regret the long term. you gotta think more long term
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:54:34
I bet either this late this year or maybe early next year it will be.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:13:57
or they will just scoop all the wests panic at a discount
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:28:37
i am joking here guys
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:50:00
this might be the best bitcoin meme iv seen
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:20:06
says the guy who probably hasn't held cash in his hands for years. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:17:54
double bottom anyone? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:29:13
well hello again there 10k long time no see
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:55:28
what does that mean?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:11
check back in about 2-3 months and you will be eating those words
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:40:46
looks like someone doesn't know about LN
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:43:51
will do
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:18:57
why does the market take such a hit to news that really has nothing to do with any real coins?
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:01:30
when bitcoin start to make a bull run do alts loose more of their value because their trading pairs are in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:37:15
I will treat them well. thanks for the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:35:56
hodling since 18k my brotha
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:10:05
jet pack?
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:48:21
for real
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:19:07
do it. hodl till December. make profits.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:17:13
for those who have watched the market for a while are weekends usually slow for BTC or is that not true in general? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:09:53
i mean you guys thing the dip is over. it bounced off the 100 day.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:31:46
I can trade all I want with my personal wallet. This is kinda the whole point of bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:18:48
at leastt they got strong hands
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:39
I only have litecoin and a few bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:35
I know but people are so weak they could just keep dumping in panic but I'm holding strong. how long till we are back to normal you think?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:54:59
lol. lets ay I'm 35
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:23:33
Na i can send bitcoin to who ever I want. I don't need an exchange to send it to someone. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:39:27
haha what is this fromI remember it but can put my tongue on it
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:30:48
I was just trying to be demeaning to it because I don't like what it is. It is hardly a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:37
I think it will go back up after this shit show is over but idk i got some at 18700 today so i am right there with ya. anyone else this it will go up again?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:46:57
looks like someone doesn't understand the revolution here and just sees bit coin as a way to make fiat. more people becoming aware of it is a good thing not a bad thing. this is just a typical crypto correction that happens after a big run up nothing more.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:03:35
this is why you hodl. the average person can not beat them at this game
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:44
id wait till it starts to go back on the up trend for a few hours or you can try and call the bottom if you want. long term buying now will sure bring big profits months from now
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:41:28
this is the first i am seeing of this.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:07:04
someone explain the point of having more than a couple different coins like more than 5? (I realize this is the bitcoin page so if this is not the place tell me where to go)
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:56:48
we got are selves another oracle guys. holy he save some crystal balls for the rest of us
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:53:49
welcome to cryptos bud
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:05:37
its a fake
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:38:25
doesn't look like this guy is gunna hop back in soon. maybe he will fomo on the next bull run. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:26:22
you will be salty if you miss the bottom though and the price goes over what you sold it for. thats why hodling is best bet.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:41:46
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:17
looks like someone doesn't know about lighting network lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:37:10
he will learn his lesson
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:44:11
because it has for the past 9 years. It is a revolutionary technology that does have real world value. And because of economics. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:52:00
your loss m8
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:53:30
I think we are in or have passed the "capitulation or anger" phase of the market cycle. It could probably drop a little bit more before the upswing again but we at or close to the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:11:44
got anymore crystal balls for rest of us?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:43:20
what the connection with bitcoin and draggonaball? it seems as if its the main meme for it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:41:25
got anymore crystal ball for the rest of us?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:04:40
but no one can predict the bottom. it might be now it might be in a week or two. no one knows. There is a massive amount of evidence that this is normal for crypto and late February / march the tide will most likely turn. The fact that people like you are in a disbar mode shows we are somewhat close to the end of correction but again no one knows and thats the point.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:39:09
thats how it works buy definition with any currency. if you say the to .1% owns the most by definition of course they do, lol they are the top .1%
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:58:50
no panic here cool like Michael Cera
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:10:32
looks like we are finishing up wave to on big picture eliot wave. big wave 3 incoming
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:08:27
Im just holding because Im not trying to call the bottom and don't want to sell at the bottom. anyone else in this boat?
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:42:42
these are cheep compared to their future price. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:15:23
Please tell me more fortune teller
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:36:34
this is not true. you need to buy bitcoin with fiat first before being able to then move it to tether. It is not true that bitcoins price is artificially pumped by tether but probably the opposite because tether has been a place to sell bitcoin to on exchanges who only have that making it an out when it is crashing causing even more crashing than without tether. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:07:11
hodl m8. you will be glad you did. when making an investment don't look at short term day to day price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:54:23
or you could just not check the price everyday lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:46:49
so many financial geniuses in the sub today. Classic bubble talking points people have been saying for years and years and really they don't understand shit like the rest of us. Almost everyone who truly understands the future potential of bitcoin is extremely bullish. Only reason they are here is because of the dip. once the dip is over they will go away until the next big dip. the cycle repeats. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:34:46
again you can't just buy tether with fiat. you need to buy bitcoin first so again tether doesn't prop it up. make you are talking about the people at bitfinex but even that is true that would me a tiny amount and should not affect the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:00:06
who the fuck is selling right now? I fell like everyone who panic sold sold already so whats going on here? manipulation?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:12:28
you know the bulls are going hard when a 2% drop causes people to panic and think we are going back down
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:10:10
the amount of people who come to this sub just to spread FUD and have absolute no idea what they are talking about is hilarious. If you think bitcoin is dead then welcome to the 20th chapter of that story. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:18:21
seems plausible 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:31:13
it will be well above it my friend. we are still early in the game
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:30:56
Woke up to huge dip so whats the FUD this time guys?
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:36:51
56 dollars for 10 beans?!?! what kind are they?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:16:56
got any crystal balls for the rest of us?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:25
if you think bitcoin and pets.com are comparable then you don't know what your talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:41:11
what percentage of people who will own bitcoin one day currently have bough some?
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:40:44
that doesn't cause the btc price to rise. the only thing that causes it to rise is when people buy btc
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:12:42
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:15:23
maybe 15% have herd the name bitcoin before but yeah only about 1-3% actually understand what it is and are somewhat invested. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:48:43
you are just proving my point bud. apples and oranges. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:02:30
again I see what you are trying to say but you seem to not actually understand what bitcoin actually is. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:57:00
This is no different from a college/university. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:29:24
I don't get it either all this great news and we have already been in a correction and it still is dropping hard.
