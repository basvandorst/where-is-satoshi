If it's a multi-year bear market, wouldn't it make more sense to sell everything, invest it in the stock market for a couple years, then buy back in when prices are lower?

Are you or are you not predicting a multi-year bear market? If you are, why do you want to hold Bitcoin during a period where it's not going to go up?
In any case, you can't predict changes in the prices of financial assets. They do not mirrror psychology.

But you said we were in for a multi-year bear market.

Past performance has no effect on future performance.
If it takes a crystal ball to predict those days, why are you predicting that they won't happen for a few years?

If you're not blessed with clairvoyance, on what grounds can you predict a multi-year bear market?

Why not sell and buy back in a year from now?

Then if you're that certain, it doesn't make any sense to own any Bitcoin for awhile.

If the dumping is almost over, why are you calling a multi-year bear market?


I'm not advising anyone to do anything. The price of bitcoin is unpredictable.
But if you actually believe that the price isn't going to rise for a few years, it doesn't make sense to own any Bitcoin over that period. Your money would just be sitting there doing nothing while it could be earning returns.
