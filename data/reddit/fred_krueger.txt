Volatility ensures both inflation and deflation over time. One may also consider valuing crypto in a truly stable asset (which doesn't exist) instead of fiat that has a constant volatile inflation. You wouldn't use tomatoes drying under the sun as a measure of weight, would you?

What I meant with that was that it's not gonna be useful during a major crisis where the economy totally collapses and all the industry goes down. As long as everything works there's a lot of usage areas both for gold and crypto. 
You're right, I should have said that differently.

The ultimate proof of the dangers with centralization

My point is that if you value something using something that doesn't have a constant value you'll get fake results. Say that your car has a weight of 1000 tomatoes. Let the tomatoes dry under the sun and your car's weight is suddenly 10,000 tomatoes. You see the problem?

Pay per hour would allow lower fees as you probably won't use it 24x7 anyway. Lot's of VPS providers with hourly billing also provide OpenVPN images for that purpose.

I've been mining there for a couple of months, both with my own devices and cloud mining. While you do make a profit, withdrawals works (even to the fees are high) and the service overall seems legit you're not getting the full reward.
5TH/s BTC mining should give $4.30/day but instead, you get maybe $3-$3.50/day ($1/day with cloud mining even tho the fee is $0.33/TH/day ($1.65/day)). Stats are only the sum and it's displayed in USD so it's really hard to actually know how big your profit is. It's also hard to say what's the cause of this. If the service is unstable, or if it's my setup that produces bad shares etc..
Id's say it's a scam but mostly due to lack of transparency. You can still use it and make a profit and you're probably safe, but don't trust them with the profit you can't afford to lose and always keep an eye on them.

The average Joe is brainwashed by a trust based system. They would trust Carlos Matos if he claimed to have a vault full of gold. The trust-based bank system has made people naive.

Because people value Bitcoin in Fiat and see their portfolio of Fiat increase in value. You can't really blame crypto for that.

Gold has a market value thanks to limited supply. You can't use the gold itself for anything, but you can trade gold for things you need. Same applies to cryptocurrencies with the difference that it's digital.

Thanks to good wallets. Cryptocurrency itself is just the protocol. You don't see the average Joe working directly on the banks API do you?

Up 10% today, name a FIAT currency that ever did that?
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:07:31
I don't think they'll ever shut down and run away like the typical scammers but something isn't right with the payouts.

FIAT is a bubble that only exists because of growing debt, as soon as people for any reason stop lending more to consume more of the earth finite resources (which they will as soon as we're out of resources) the whole system will fail and FIAT will be eventually become worthless.

As a globalist, why do you prefer a nationalist currency system over a global system like cryptocurrencies?

Might be good for them but not for Bitcoin since that would just make one already big whale even bigger. What's strange is that exchanges don't put up any limitations so that you can't just sell off thousands of BTC at once. A limit of 10 BTC/day (adjusted after the price) would still let them cash out big amounts of money over a longer period without damaging the price. Exhanges to other cryptocurrencies and withdrawals/deposits to local wallets would still be unlimited and unregulated of course.

Usefulness within the industry is good for the value but it's not a required property for a currency. Cryptocurrency can also be used as more than currency, the blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized storage, computation etc.
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:34:54
The world eventually needs a currency based on market value instead of a constantly growing debt. The average Joe wants that currency to be digital and easy to use. What else than cryptocurrency has those properties?

Centralised exchanges aren't much about BTC tho, it's a way to exchange between cryptocurrency and fiat currency where fiat is regulated. I like cryptocurrency for its technical benefits and yes it should remain unregulated.

Haven't checked but I'm pretty sure gas and grocery prices have increased as well as in places where digital price tags are used. I'll also have to pay 4% more for exchanges to USD or EUR obviously when buying stuff from foreign countries.

There are already a lot of altcoins based on POS. While POS may be better Bitcoin wouldn't be Bitcoin if such a radical change where applied. 16,909 BTC of maximum 21,000,000 BTC is currently in circulation. POS doesn't offer any block reward. Who's gonna get the remaining 4M+ BTC? or should we just stop at 16,909 BTC.

Meanwhile, my fiat holdings fell 4% against the USD and EUR yesterday and people still think that's safer than crypto.

GDPR is mainly aimed towards those who host and therefore "own" personal data. Nobody "owns" Bitcoin or the blockchain hence nobody can be responsible for what's on there.
