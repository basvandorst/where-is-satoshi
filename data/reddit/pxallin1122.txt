Thanks for the reply. 
The first response was 48hours later and by the time i was asked for "further clarification" My account was fully banned. The only screen i would see is the one that asks you to withdraw your remaining balance. After clarifying that on my hackerone report i waited for over a month to hear your response. While time was passing away i found out that it was already fixed and on December 1 my case was labeled as "informative"

First of all i would like to state that Coinbase keeps close to 10,000 BTC in their hot wallet and if someone were to exploit this to even gain half of their hot wallet it would be over $2.2M in today's prices, which means that the bounty paid out was only 0.227% worth of substantial damages which the bug could have caused. They have also stated that with the exploit i was never able to withdraw any of the excess balance, but that and everything else left out will be fully clarified in my upcoming update i'm currently working on.

Let's say we have the first exploit resolved. That wasn't even the whole point of my post. No point in arguing about it. Let's get back to the second exploit, which i was unable to correctly resolve it with you because i got banned at same time when asked for more details and was unable to provide more info. After that happened i waited for over a month, while trying to get in touch with the higher ups every few days, which can be seen on my Hackerone post. After i get reply it is closed and the bug seems to be patched. As much as you guys have stated that the banning has nothing to do with the bounty, the timing of it seems very weird.

I would love to hear from the coinbase higher up's. The last time i tried contacting them they took months to respond.

I would also like to state that at the time of me reporting the bug, they had no bounty payment lists for any bugs posted. They just had Min bounty, which i believe was at $100

We are talking about me saving them Millions worth of damages if someone would have found this and abused it for wrong reasons. My expectation of $25k+ was not even that big. That wasn't even the main point of my post. Main point is that they did used some sketchy tactics to fuck me over on the second report i made and totally disregarded me.

This was never the case from my side. Will be posting update with full clarification, including dates and response times from both parties .

Thanks for the response Coinbase. Unfortunately some important information in my case has been left out. I will be updating my post later today for full Transparency.

At the time of the bug report they didn't have their bounties listed and i was unable to discuss any kind of arrangement prior to the report, since they told me it was against their terms. I still believe that at that time my expectation of $25k was reasonable.

I'm not quite sure if this should be discussed publicly, since i think there still might be bugs around the "Vault". That being said there was/is a way to withdraw while making the coins go back to the Vault at the same time, without affecting the Main wallet going to negative. I believe i had mentioned this on my second exploit report.
@_date: 2015-12-20 23:39:52
There is no way i can replicate that because you fixed the 2nd exploit, even before it got labeled "informative"
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:17:24
Will be posting an update later today with full transparency on the issue.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:31:36
I completely agree with you and i am aware of how bounties work. This is not the first exploit i have solved/reported. You have to understand  that i got 0.11% of what a black hat hacker could have gotten from properly executing the exploit with the right team.
@_date: 2015-12-20 23:55:46
My current account at the time was letting me put it in the "Pending" state resulting in the exploit.

Hi Charlie,
Thanks for the reply. Everything you said in your post is correct. Once my balance went negative you can't do anything, but if you were to do this with multiple accounts and a bigger balance then 2BTC, you would only need to do this once on every account to fully exploit the bug. That being said you could create an endless circle of multiple accounts with negative balance. Therefore i think it was worth more than $5k.

I would advise against putting hackerone reports public. I think the matter should be handled privately. For the scenario as i have stated there was a way to stop your balance from going negative resulting in user being able to withdraw, without the system putting "Lock" on your account.
