hash rate =/= to solves.  You could have a hash rate of 1/sec and have some mericale of luck and solve 10 hashs.
In rollette the probility of it coming up black 150 times in a row is so small, but yet it could happen.  This method seems to be a roll of the dice in terms of hashing power needed.  The likelyhood of them getting anything out of it would be so small.  They just wanted to offer an alternative to google ads that track your behavoir.

haven't looked at any of the coding or done any alaysis on it.  But it sounds like he figure out a way to use a web based platform to take over a GPU/CPU for mining bitcoin.  The highlighted part is what I find odd, in that the bitcoin PoW is being completed and just not going to thier specific server.
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:34:37
not if they can't get that money to a location discretely without anyone knowing.  Plus if you don't want someone knowing what country is providing funding.  
Lets say you have to get x but they won't sell it to people outside its home country (dual use export controlled).  If you provide money to local z.  You would be providing your home currency.  They would go exchange it, red flag because they haven't left the country, no family, etc.  Then proceed to buy x, red flag.  Now if someone looks back they could say, you a-hole country you did y and because you got x through local z.

I give to you the unredacted document  or at least very close to it
This is where your files comes from and is unredacted
I would run a couple different  versions of virus scan software.  They really arent giving you anything that hasn't been seen before.
Eather you didn't do a simple google search before submitting the foia. You are trying to get people to run downlaod those files so you can get some coins or you are getting custom created spyware.

did the cd come with sharpie written on it, or was it thermal printed.  If it was thermal printed that means it uses a big machine and typically done in a server type enviroment with grabbers and cnc programing.
question 1
Not if it was put on using protocals inplace.  Depending on the type of recording used, it can be "open" to writing. DVD/CD creation using  UDF 1.02 writes to all sectors of the DVD and has to be custom configured to be the default by the writing software.
No incept has to be done if it is inserted at burning.  Why wouldn't someone want to put in place a way to gather data on people that are trying to get data out of them.
suxtnet was exactly that, infections occuring and spreading through usb and other drives.  How many people had it on there computer that were 10-20-30 steps away from any of the target system.  Your system might not be a target but it can get it one step closer to an actual target.  
question 2 
While your 2 things point out some SR1 data.  That is about all, which if you look at the criminal fillings for SR1 you will find just that.
By making lists you pissed your self off.  Your revalations were old data that has been rehashed as a picture.

Yes but 200 million cpu cores might be able to produce a right result.  If they would run it like a pool the btc would be distributed to all websites that are running it.
All that a hash is doing is trying to get a specific result.  If you randomize the input hash so that it doesn't follow a specific chain, you increase your chance of finding the correct result because more people are calculating on a linear scale.  1 x publice key=result, 2xpublic key=result .... so on and so on.  So the arms race is the faster you get to 000000000000000034000030304898293765 you win.  But if you would do 000000000000000034000030304897892210 x public key = result you would be that much closer.
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:35:38
we live in a world of impossible things happening all the time.
I am not disagreeing with you, but if you have 200 websites that have an average site visit of 5 mins and average 200,000 visiters each block of time, with 4 cores of say 1.65 Ghz.  You increase the chances of a block generation.  It is kind of like the distributed processing when you have your screen saver up.

It has nothing to do with payments.  That is what I am saying.  Read between the lines of it.  Yes bitcoin is new.  Your seeing this through distorted hearing.  What I am trying to say is that this conference is the place where for the next year they will decide how much money to spend on LE's approach to target bitcoin.
It also has to do with the basic quandry that we are in now.  BTC has become a victum of the news cycles which causes secondardy price swings by reposted news.
Example 1: mastercard hired lobbyest in april, there was links to the pdf showing proof.  It was rewritten and reposted by forbes.  So instead of people thinking for themselves, a simple conclusion was given to them.  They are told how they should react or feel.  (in truth i never read the artilce becaue I read the actual pdf's)
Example 2: you are told a joke, it isn't funny.  you are told the same joke again, but the person rings a bell, you laugh.  Not because of the joke.  Because someone rang a bell.

it might not be the fbi.  It could have been added on the boot sector of the cd for when you put the cd into the drive.  That is super easy to do and requires no interaction on your part.  It is cheap as hell to do.  Place 10 cd on the ground around a business with "2014 tax return data" on it.
It contains both your documents but are combined.  Only some of the citations have been changed and also a few of the pictures such as the slik road one.
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:58:51
this means they are planning on doing something with bitcoin.  Meaning that they will start linking accounts and other things like that.  SR2, agora and other stuff like that while the vendors will be safe because of mixing, the people it is coming to won't be.
Sole source means they didn't post open requirement and are doing things hush hush.  They selected the company because of bribes paid/friends/etc.
The other stuff is saying that they need a clearence level of "top secret:sensitive compartmented information (ts:sci)" within a dual authorization access room.
They are going to be linking together data from financial institutions, IRS, and other databases to pull identities.

they can't run down every coin and if you make it so that for every .01 btc they have to follow it 20-30 jumps.  They can't spend that kind of money on it.  Move them through many exchanges and cold storage them for a little then bring them back on line.  It will be like easter sundy when jesus laid the eggs that hatched rabbits.

you have been able to convert btc into Pmoney since its creation, most are protected and if you aren't using the correct browser type thing you wont even be able to access these sites.  This entire model was created as a giant value transfer node to confuse people and take a % off the top.  Most of what I have seen in the last 2 years is people transfering money from cryptowall and/or other scams to clean money without having to go to 100 different places.
