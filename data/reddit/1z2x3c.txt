you have a biased pov

I have bitcoins and I also question it's sustainability.  Just because it's the first cryptocurrency to establish itself at a mass scale does not make it impervious from competition.

Jesus, are we on fucking Yahoo Finance or something?  Go away.

You guys realize you sound like cult members, right?

Would have been more tragic if it actually happened.

Opinions and assholes.

Something for you to consider, as you're sitting on a real amount on money right now.  Bitcoin is the first.  You're mentioning gmail and iPhone.  They weren't the first.  hotmail was, and blackberry, etc.  
A lot of times the "first" in market gets squashed by more refined successors.  Nothing is preventing this happening with Bitcoin.
If I made the return on a stock that you did on Bitcoin I would sell half and let the rest ride, if I believed in it.

It's not a mistake.  Bitcoin is perfect.  Buy more, what's wrong with you.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:40:57
Slippery slope.  I don't know you, you don't know me, but that's my advice.

Don't invest using a credit card. Just don't.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:00:42
People did invest in all those services, they just ended up dumping it for the better alternative (gmail, iphone, etc).
You make an interesting point about a protocol, and I can see the TCP/IP and Bitcoin relation.  What's left to be seen is if the "bitcoin" brand is the one that survives the coming crypto-currency war.
At the end of the day, it's what the majority of people choose to use.  Loyalty is tough in the digital age.

I made a profit off my sale.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:04:56
People are way too emotional about Bitcoin.  Your comment and the other guy calling me a pussy help reinforce my opinion. 
I view this as a risky investment, and I decided to take profit in anticipation of a further dip.  It isn't about rooting for teams, it's about making money.
The China news and the uncertainty of who will spend vs hoard Bitcoin pushed my decision.
When the price stabilizes I'll prob buy back in, but with the full knowledge that it's a total gamble.

How delusional are you?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:52:17
Well, I've invested in Google so now you know at least one.  I'm not against Bitcoin, I just don't have any stake in it beside the amount I own that I consider a gamble.  I also appreciate the passion people have for Bitcoin.
Out of curiosity, and without being descriptive, do you have and other position in public companies, funds or bonds?
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:06:42
Sorry, I'm just not that vested.  I don't have a crystal ball but apparently you do, and a lovely attitude to boot.  Good luck with all that.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:59:02
We did it, Reddit!
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:22:59
Why and how.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:18:21
Who cares?  It's a poorly written article.  Don't apologize for them simply because it's pro BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:51:16
It's called gambling.  You see a lot of those people chasing crushed dreams in the cashier line.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:19:22
how much did you invest?  100% of $5k or more like $50k?
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:09:47
It's fucking annoying and makes me think it's just a bunch of potheads and OWS idealists who are supporting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:02:39
What's Stock?  I don't see that on the cryptocurrency charts.

I'm right and you're wrong x100.  Now your turn to tell me the same thing x100.  Conversation over :)
Happy Monday!
