I don't doubt it'll go higher and is here to stay, but I don't think it's going to happen this rapidly. I would be pleasantly surprised if it did though.

Of course if you look for something, you will find it. Write down EVERY news article/recording related to crypto for 6 months and then sort them into good/bad/neutral. Calculate the ratio and then you can approach something called proof. Even then it will be biased by things such as current state of market.

It appears we have a vastly different understanding of what a gift means. That's not a gift, it's forced investment.
I'm enthusiastic about crypto, but have some perspective and don't try to shove it down everyone's throats just because **you** care about it - others might not, and they deserve to make that choice for themselves.

Some do. *You* won't. Sorry Stan!

So what if she wants to sell it and use the money? People have responsibilities, and money helps - especially if she's got children. He needs to stop being petty and stop trying to force his own interests on other people. Are you guys really so emotionally handicapped that teaching a stupid lesson means more to you than good relationships with your family?
I think he should've never gifted BTC to begin with. You tailor gifts to the people receiving then, not your own interests. But here we are. He can still give her the copy he made, suggest to only cash out half and save the rest. If she didn't know before she will now, that it can appreciate in value, and take better care of it.

News article headlines are not proof of anything.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:46:51
Sure they can. Except all you did was highlight a bunch of headlines and called them proof. I don't think you understand what proof means, and your album proves nothing. I could selectively pick a hundred different combinations of articles to paint a hundred different views. At best you provided example cases, biased ones. But even calling them examples is a stretch given that it's just headlines and we don't know what the actual contents are.

So make it stop. Why would you want to be with a person like that?
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:16:08
Like I said, we seen to have different understandings of what a gift is meant to be.
Let's say I have absolutely no interest in gardening. I don't even have a garden or the space for one. My birthday comes around and the weird cousin stops by with a gift. He's a gardener so he brings me a bag of fertilizer. "It's an investment opportunity," he claims. "All you need to do is use this on your plants and if you are patient and careful, you might end up with some vegetables a few months down the line."
Does that sound like a reasonable approach to gifting? I don't think I'm being irrational, I think you're projecting your enthusiasm onto others who may not share it, making you an inconsiderate gifter.

Like I said, I believe we fundamentally disagree on this topic.


Sure it does. It comes with the baggage of having to learn what it is, how to safely store it, how to transfer it, how to exchange it for fiat..


Because I disagree with you, obviously. And reddit is a discussion platform. If you don't like it, don't enter the conversation, rather than trying to pick at my feelings once you run out of valid arguments.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:05:43
Good luck with that. Anyone able to predict market movements accurately is probably a very rich person, and I doubt they're around here making claims about it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:29:01
People don't want to admit it, but the crypto community is hungry for recognition, whatever shape that may take.
That being said, I do think the sentiment is directed towards the price movement, not reddit memeing. And the fact that the price is not affected much is a good indication that we are still in the very early stages of adoption. Like it or not, what the president says can cause large ripples among the general public. Because crypto is still limited to a minority of enthusiasts and hopeful investors, such announcements have little sway at the moment.
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:28:33
Yes. But it won't be worth that much by 2020, that'd be insane. ��
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:18:23
No argument there. You did your job, and it's not unreasonable for you to not want to do things outside your job description.
I was referring to people who know what they're meant to be doing and intentionally half-arse it anyway while collecting the paycheck.
And just to be clear, my denunciation of such behaviour by the employee does not mean I support shitty employer behaviour. It is perfectly possible for the employee to have legitimate reasons for how they are acting, or for both parties to be in the wrong. It's just that not being paid more when you've clearly agreed to a given sum is not a good enough reason for doing a bad job.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:34:36
Don't bother. I question whether these people have ever worked an honest day in their life. With this kind of attitude, they wouldn't hold a job for long.
Yes, some jobs should be paid better. But when you get hired, you discuss what is expected of you and how much you will be compensated for it. If you don't agree with the terms then don't accept the job offer. It is unethical to agree to do the work then half-arse it, pocketing the money anyway. I'd argue that at some point it is no different than theft.

At that point he really should've taken much more than 300k out. Even leaving half of it in means that if Bitcoin reaches its full potential, he's never going to have to think about money again. At the same time, he's going to be living very comfortably with what he takes out until moon time.

I hope they work on their branding, the place looks boring as fuck.

About as secure as storing it in plaintext.

Where would we be if everyone followed that? We are meant to challenge each other and point out flaws, so that things can improve and tend towards better not worse.


I'm not a designer, I just know what looks good to me and what doesn't. But sure, pay me an hourly consultation fee and I'll do the work of researching this for you. You would be better off paying someone who does this for a living though. That, or spending time learning and observing how other people do it - those who have an attention grabbing and memorable brand, and attract a larger amount of clientele as a result.

They're by far in the minority. Let me guess, you think the US is the last bastion of human rights and hope for the future? ��

But what's **really** wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:54:49
I agree, you're right. This is what I get for trying to half-ass a reply while sleep deprived and in the middle of a busy commute. What I was trying to say is that inherently there is nothing wrong with it and it could function just fine as a currency, the limiting factor is how people use it and the lack of adoption.

Sometimes you're just waiting for that extra bit of disposable income and miss a low price.

Hodl, sell... do whatever you want. You'll be back the moment it starts going up again, because you're greedy.
The rest of us who are here for the tech are going to relax and wait for the inevitable.

You must be in a  lot of pain to lash out at people online like this. I'm really sorry, I hope things get better.

That's because the technical analyses are bullshit. It's not about the shape of the curve, it's about the sentiment of the masses.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:17:04
It has nothing to do with what your opinion on the future direction of Bitcoin is. You are just here looking to stir the shit as evident by your insulting entry to this thread.
Anyone with half a brain will realise that after checking your profile, so good luck with your bullshit.

Pinky swear.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:22:02
Exactly. I'd rather lose everything I invested and see it fail than beat myself up later for giving up on it when it succeeds. At the end of the day, it's just money - there's more to life than that. The key is not to invest more than you are prepared to lose and none of these market movements will phase you.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:59:14
Why are **you** here if this place is so bad? Surely being as smart as you are, you don't need to waste your time on reddit.

If you're clever, you will launch it before him. Then sell it to him for a million when the time comes so he can save face.
