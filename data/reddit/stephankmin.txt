Agreed. As people have been saying on this sub, only around 0.2% of adoption right now. So even if btc is a bubble (which I believe it is, at least to a small extent), it's still very very early and will likely make huge gains.

Yes, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t be filled with loans anytime soon. We have no idea how the “horde” will react.
Last night there was literally a new post on this sub about someone living paycheck to paycheck asking if it is a good idea to take out a loan to buy btc. I agree right now it’s backed largely by “actual” money, but its shit like this that worries me.

I know exactly what you mean. To me, it seems like an example of information asymmetry, when one party in a transaction knows more than another party. Bitcoin is particularly interesting because instead of a buyer knowing more than a seller or vice versa, the people engaging in the transactions (hodlers AND sellers) know more than those NOT engaging in them.
For instance, I'm assuming the vast majority of hodlers have an above average understanding of tech, crypto, etc. and of course you need spending money to buy bitcoin in the first place. And if bitcoin truly becomes a global decentralized payment system, then the people who learn about btc and blockchain technology last (those w/o Internet/access to info) would seem to be the most at risk of major inequality.
These are just my thoughts, would love to hear from everyone else.
