Anyone know why the price gone up to 250 though? Last day it was under 100. Scary stuffs.

Except you get hate no matter who you are. Certain people will dislike you and your work and that is okay. This also includes the general troll. Most of his posts hit front page anyway, so this is just another overrated drama.

May I recommend LG G2? I have had it for around 2 months now, and can't find anything bad about it.

Holding on to the bitcoins won't help in anyway. If you are truly bullish, you need to spend or play around with a very small amount of your BTC.

Where do you see bitcoin in one year?
A. To the Moon.

C. To the Moon. 
D. To the freaking Moon.

It's just betting. You wager an amount, and maybe choose the chance of your winning. If you win depending on that chance, you get more bitcoins, if you lose, you lose everything. Here is a free website to play around,

It could be both. If it is the coins recovered by mtgox for example, then it is good news, but if the person behind transferring them has a goal of selling these it would crash the price.

Not double checking your facts has nothing to do with making a mistake. 
This one is done on purpose.

So nothing about Starbucks? That's a bummer.

Yeah but I don't recall it emailing you if you suddenly login from a different country. You just have to check it very regulary.

Gmail has three options for 2FA. By calling, texting, or using the google authenticator.

Yeah except you are going to have to be prepared for outrageous fees.

1) $500 Million Lost
2) The End!

It was a bank transfer. Not a cash deposit unfortunately. I heard the only way to reverse a bank transfer is to specifically request an unauthorized transfer.

3) Lost money

I don't know. I personally haven't had good experiences coming out of ebay/paypal. So I guess we will have to wait this one out.

Alright that gave me giggle actually.

"They are choosing a less risky option. By selling now, they get the price of the machine no matter what happens to the BitCoin economy. They are defining their core competency as being in the hardware business not the cryptocurrency business.
The same could be said for people selling pickaxes during the Gold Rush. Why not use the pickaxes to mine gold? They got the money for the pickaxes up front, then they were out of the picture. They didn't have to choose a place to prospect and worry about how long the gold would last. They chose to be in the pickaxe business not the mining business. Incidentally, during the Gold Rush it was these peripheral entrepreneurs that made much more than your typical gold miner."

I about 0.1 at $850 using instant. But anyone knows at coinbase if you buy not the instant version, does it give the amount of bitcoin at the time of purchase, or at the time of transfer?

They get shit ton of money from their fees though and because they are 8 people doesn't give them any excuse not to keep up with the rising demand.

Happens during big events like Black Friday. All of a sudden everyone is spending and not buying. If the china deal also becomes no biggie, we should supper pass 2k by Fed.

Its gonna go down during Christmas, but my bet is on Feb
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:34:18
It will let you post the advertisement if you choose cash, other methods like bank transfer, no. Either use the cash option or just sell it to someone on there. But idk whats the reason behind it.

I don't care how dollar is doing right now. It was a simple example. Dollar like any other currencies can lose value for whatever reason. I wasn't arguing on whether it is going to crashing or not. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:46:39
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:40:23
Same thing could be said about USD. You pay them the regular $737 and the very next day dollar just crashes and loses its value. Since bitcoin is really new though, it doesn't have a stabilized price yet.
Also, as far as I recalled these merchant immediately exchange their bitcoin for USD.
