There's nodes and then there's miners. You want as many as you can get of each, it democratizes and secures the network. Bigger blocks means more storage is required to run a node, which means fewer people will do it.

It's a best guess estimate based on anticipated transaction volume and blockchain size growth. Too small and you can't fit many transactions, too big and it becomes too expensive for a hobbyist to run a node, which would lead to centralization.

Never done it with BTC, but have seen it done with gold.  In those cases the gold account was set up at the trust beneficiary's choice (bullionvault.com) but the linked bank account belonged to the trust manager.  A similar arrangement should be possible with bitcoin, but the trust fund manager might need to hold the password so that bitcoin cannot be sent out.
Of course then the coins are left on the exchange, which is not optimal, so the trust manager should transfer funds off exchange to something they control.  If your trust manager is not tech-savvy it might be best to find one who is.

In my mind, no reputable company like Amazon wants to be associated with the Silk Road trade.  As bitcoin gains legitimacy, however, this can change.
Also, Amazon wants you to use their stupid coins.  Buy 10 of their coins, redeem 9 of them and hey.. if you don't redeem it in time, Amazon probably takes it back but you've already paid for it, so you technically overpaid for whatever you bought previously.  They aren't stupid, it's a smart (albeit greedy) way to do business.

Avalon is not doing any more batches I am aware of, but Terrahash might be an option.
Butterflylabs may ship to you in a few months but their backlog is huge.
KNCMiner might be worth looking into but as far as I know they've only shown FPGA hardware. Their ASIC hardware is probably legit but who knows when they will ship.
Anything ASIC on eBay is either grossly overpriced or a scam. Frequently both.
GPU rigs, unless you can get the cards for near-free or less, are totally not with it.

I tell older people that miners serve the function of banks and central banks.  That it is more appropriate to think of miners as accountants or auditors; auditing all bitcoin transactions to keep everyone honest.
I usually leave out that this is how new coins are made, technically that is secondary to the auditing function and is more of an advanced-class topic.

The price of bitcoin is a factor too.  Today I will mine 0.05 BTC worth $5.50.  Next year the difficulty will be so high because of ASIC hardware I might only mine 0.001 .. but what if the price is  $5000?  Dollar-wise it's a wash (and also an unrealistic expectation).
Like anything though, it's a gamble.  Could be worth 0 just as likely.

They're saying they can go to the grocery store and buy food with USD but you cannot do that with BTC.  I would add 'Yet' to that statement.  I think it's a stupid argument anyway.
I used to run with the peak oil/survivalist crowd and they said the same thing to gold &amp; silver hoarders.  Many of them said to buy guns, which could be used to take food away from those that had it.  My rationale for buying gold back then was to use it as a currency if the world ended, and as an investment if it didnt.

We're kicking ourselves because so far there has been no bad time to buy.  
Coins bought even just last week have appreciated more than big-name stocks.
Until recently, there was no bad time to buy GPUs to mine.  I bought a couple cards in 2011 and more this January for mining and was iffy on if they'd pay for themselves.  Now I'm kicking myself for not buying more.
BFL controversy aside, I think the raised prices on ASIC miners are fair and will generate a profit for their owners.  I've ordered one and I may order more.  I'll probably kick myself for not getting more sooner.
If the current price trend continues, we'll still be kicking ourselves a month from now for not buying more today.
This will continue until our woe becomes "why didn't I sell?"..

You could accept bitcoin payment inside the store, but not directly on your POS.  Gas station POS choices are limited because of the need to have pump control in them.  Some vendors would program bitcoin in for you, but previous experience indicates to me that they will be reluctant and charge 5 figures to add the feature.  Minimum.
A simpler option would be to have a 2nd bitcoin-only POS.  Do your bitcoin transaction there, then cash out the sale on the main POS to clear the fuel transaction.  If your POS software supports it add a new payment type button, this will make balancing the books a lot easier.  I'd also have a QR code sticker on the counter for the customer to scan.  
Pay at the pump is even worse.  Everything is proprietary and can differ wildly between stations, nothing automatic involving bitcoin is going to happen out there until pump manufacturers like Gilbarco and Wayne want to.
You *could* custom make some interesting solution to do bitcoin at the pumps, but unless you are intimately familiar with pump control systems and have a way to interface with the POS it just isn't going to happen.  Don't forget PCI regulations either.

If China were to ditch the Yuan in favor of Bitcoin they would need 50 billion BTC at today's prices.  Given that there are only 11 million in existence right now, he is implicating that the price of bitcoin would need to increase about 4500-fold.  That would make 1 BTC worth over $500,000 USD.

You wouldn't need to make an entire pump (misnomer: the actual pump is underground, the thing with the fuel nozzle on it is called a dispenser).
