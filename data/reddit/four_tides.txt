Yes, I've seen that Coinbase is best for beginners or just using their vault storage system which is pretty cool. Gdax is good for more advanced users and I think the fees are much cheaper. Only downside is that you cant buy bitcoin with a credit card on GDAX

Good question. Offline wallets are confused with "cold storage" wallets often. Here's the difference:
- An offline wallet is simply offline most of the time. This could be a desktop wallet, hardware wallet, paper wallet. These wallets will sometimes need to connect online to make transactions. Private keys can be vulnerable because of this. 
- A cold storage wallet is also always offline, but the big difference is that keys are never "loaded up" online for transactions to be made. Instead, transactions are signed offline and then broadcasted later on with another device. Most hardware wallets don't fit the the pure "cold" storage definition as they have to connect via USB

Use [this guide]( for bitcoin purchasing, which essentially simplifies the whole process into four steps:
1. Choosing a wallet **before** buying - for large quantities of bitcoin it is recommended to use an offline or cold storage wallet. Hardware and paper wallet examples are given (beginner options exist for these). Emphasis on not leaving or storing all your coins an a web-wallet or exchange.
2. Choosing the best payment method to deposit and buy your bitcoins on the exchanges - most people use bank transfer (cheapest but slowest), credit card (fastest but expensive fees), cash (anonymous but more effort), and paypal (very expensive fees, small quantities only).
3. Researching and choosing an exchange that accepts your desired payment method - popular sites are Kraken (trustworthy, cheap fees, bank transfer only), Coinbase (super easy to use, higher fees, card and bank transfers), Bitstamp (good for buying bitcoin in the UK, card or bank transfers), localbitcoins (good from anywhere in world, bank transfer, paypal, and cash purchases, P2P)
4. Exchanging your deposited fiat currency for bitcoin **AND** immediately withdrawing to your chosen secure wallet system. This is my favorite step. It is so much fun once you own all those bitcoins and you know that only you have access to the private keys. 
Yes, also good point about segregated witness. I've noticed that more nodes really are pushing up the price. This is a good thing for us either way :)
