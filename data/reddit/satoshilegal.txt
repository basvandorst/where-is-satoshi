I read your article and I think you've done an excellent job at dissecting the relevant issues, especially with the impending ruling by the HMRC. In addition to the currency definition, the exciting thing about bitcoin is that it can also morph into a stock and be in itself an IPO in which the stockholder also owns the underlying product. For example, instead of 21m bitcoins, we could say that there are 21 quadrillion rights (satoshis) and each of these rights may be sold/leased (one application could be to track property ownerships for a title company). I think there's certainly some interesting legal considerations that'll come out of the crypto space.

Exchanging AUD to a foreign currency &amp; vice versa in australia is considered a Financial Supply and is exempt from GST. Purchasing goods  or services (non-exempt) with foreign currency in Australia (provided you meet the registration threshold of $75k) must take into account GST, that is payable in AUD.

A public ruling will be issued by the ATO shortly and the outcome of their classification of bitcoin is unclear. One of the issues they will face is that Australian law generally, throughout several pieces of legislation, refer to "foreign currency" as "currency" from some other country (that is, issued or accepted as legal tender in some other country). Bitcoin doesn't foot that bill. They can simply come out and say that it is not "foreign currency" and leave it open as to how it should be classified. Note also that in Australia, under the AML legislation bitcoin is not even e-currency.

That's correct. Good point of clarification, I was talking about the transaction itself rather than the service surrounding the transaction (which is taxable supply).

Thanks! We'll make sure to attend to this. We're really heartened by the encouragement that we're getting in this space. I'm currently in Austin for the Texas Bitcoin Conference, and if you or anyone are attending be sure to PM me.

My cheeky response to MasterCard's perspective on Bitcoin:  
Intro: Today we’re seeing a huge change in payment technology, whether it’s the convergence of fiat currencies in digital form or the advent of decentralized means of exchange, like bitcoin. Huge opportunities exist in this field globally, so it’s very important for us to look, understand, put in question and compare the real benefits of our current mainstream payment technologies to the disruptive technologies entering the marketplace. If you’re a consumer or a merchant, a government, even a financial services provider, what’s really critical is that your, your clients’ or your constituents’ productive value is not eroded or co-opted unnecessarily, that you’re given the choice to control, absolutely, your own wealth and that the system you use is secure, protected and unforgeable. Trust in any such system is earned, and by definition a by-product or a derivation of these features. It never stands alone.  
Hope you enjoy it. This is gentlemen.

The ATO has yet to issue their public ruling to state whether bitcoin is in fact a currency, money, foreign currency, right, asset etc. There has been a private ruling leaked by Coindesk but only snippet of what it contains have been published without context. So, while the ATO could certainly say bitcoin transactions are subject to GST, it hasn't done so yet.
If it's of any help, you can see some of our reasoning on the subject here -&gt; 
Please let's not also forget that the UK was in a similar bind in relation to VAT - it is said that they are changing their ruling (although not confirmed yet), so that didn't last long.

As for me, 9 years of experience involved in corporate governance, M&amp;A, finance &amp; capital raising, compliance, property law, IP and contracts. I have a bachelors degree in Aeronautical Engineering &amp; Law, a Masters of Law, and also have applied finance &amp; investment qualifications. I'm on the roll of practitioners at the Sup. Ct of NSW &amp; a registered practitioner at the High Court of Australia (I'm currently going through the process of being licensed in Texas as well). I started my career working for a small tax law firm, then worked at Corrs Chambers Westgarth before going in-house. I've negotiated contracts from a few bucks (yes, I do count my wife's expenditures in the contract negotiation bucket!!) to $150m and was previously the director of projects for a $2b waste management project in Sydney's west. As of a few years ago, I've been involved in ventures spanning the fields of waste management, carbon derivatives, rewards &amp; gamification solutions. I'm deeply interested in using the skills I've acquired to provide a useful service to those that need it, especially where that can lead to innovation, progress &amp; growth.

Correct, a business is insolvent if they can't service their debt, liabilities or financial commitments as and when they fall due. So it only deals with cash flow, which is the most important barometer of any business (not profit or illiquid assets).

That would indeed be cool!
