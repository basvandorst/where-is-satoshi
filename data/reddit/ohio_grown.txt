How would the IRS know what I do with my btc after I bought it? Isn't it untraceable if I bought stuff with it?

Are they only looking for large cash outs then? What if I  made a purchase for seeds or silver with it since I didn't pay sales tax? Would they trace the chain? Seems awfully technical for the IRS haha

I can't find a faster way. Good thing is that you only pay for what it is at that moment, but just have to wait

Is it a sweet brine or acidic? It just sounds pretty good addition to a dish and I do a lot of pickling during the season. Maybe add some to a jar a pickles?
