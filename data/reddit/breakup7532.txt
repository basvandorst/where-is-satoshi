i think it was a xapo phish not bitgo
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:46:11
Ya it's just how bitfinex did it in the backend. They handle the setup for u behind the scenes. They also r in charge of ur bitgo key. So presumably their keys were breached. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:21:56
All I kno is mine haven't moved from the hacker address 
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:50:00
Same here. I requested my withdrawal literally seconds after they were enabled FYI
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:36:38
is this real or more bullshit?
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:17:13
Embarassing. I used to b a fan
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:19:11
No. This is coming from some1 who lost $$$ in BFX as well.
Don't make this a bitcoin problem.
Ethereum is a bunch of dumbasses rn
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:07:43
R u really gonna refund some of the ppl who lost? I was one of them but how to prove to you?
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:13:57
enough of the bitsquare spam pls.
these decentralized exchanges have HORRIBLE UX.
nobody is going to DL a program to trade on low liquidity. and wat are the FIAT options? exactly. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:15:47
so im looking at my deposit address. funds were moved from my deposit address to an address beginning with a 1 sometime today. would that seem to indicate i was a target of the breach? :(
fuckin a. i always hold my own coins. moved them over yesterday just bczu i was thinking to sell some. and in the frickin short time period i have my coins on the exchange they get hacked.
i had clef and a new api key created yesterday that didn't allow withdrawals. figured that shit was on lockdown.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:56:14
5 grand. It sucks but perspective is everything.  I can still feed myself and have shelter. Always lookin to the bright side 
I do realize not everyone is that fortunate tho.  Sry if I came off insensitive. Idk ur situation 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:48:29
Ya I also had email confirm on for withdrawals. Leading me to believe it's a direct key compromise
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:30:15

@_date: 2016-08-02 23:06:08
In terms of bitcoin? Long term u wuld think it's nbd. Short term we suffer like gox.
Also sry for ur loss. I hope u can bounce back from this and didn't allocate too much to bfx.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:54:58
U gotta consider a huge % of ppl had their coins on there for literally less than 24 hrs as they wanted to prep for a sale with the price drop.
Me included. I never keep coins on exchanges. The hacker was smart. Strike during volatility for high volume.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:55:15
Ur not worried in the slightest that ur being fed misinformation?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:09:46
Wouldn't the refund address have nothing to do with the hack tho?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:55:26
Yup. I got fucked but by God don't do what ethereum morons did.
Their hack was also $100M+ but those morons decided to destroy fungibility 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:44:10
Doesn't really address the evidence provided here tho. Def looks like u were hacked before, no? Jus means mayb u didn't notice it (which is equally embarassing)
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:23:48
with the bitstamp hack, they ate the loss correct? prolly due to their large investment base.
to my knowledge, bitfinex has no publically raised money right?
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:19:32
No context needed. Go back to Tumblr u child

It's not gonna get u ur money back tho.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:26:49
There's another bitcoin sub that'll explain it. Tl;dr bitcoin developers don't give a shit about us. Just miners. It's a centralized party
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:53:26
Yup ur chill then
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:18:14
Even worse.  What a dipshit.
Bitmex is def on my shit list then.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:42:42
Clef replaces username and password with a public private key login so it's kinda like having username and password with 2fa in one. So bitfinex has my pub key and I use my private key which is stored on my phone to authenticate. Bitfinex never sees my private key. It's a great technology.
But yeah.. someone got directly into bitfinex's bitgo keys somehow
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:22:54

@_date: 2016-08-02 20:45:48
they claim they didnt sweep any addresses so ur account was comprimised, just like mine
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:42:19
Sadly it is to wait and hope. I lost a similar amount. But legal action isn't gonna pay off in any reasonable amount unless ur chasing  $100k+. Not to mention it'd take years until u saw ur money from a legal proceeding.

The burden of proof is on Tether. You don't prove a negative.
Tether claims they are backed by dollars. Thus they have the burden of proof. And they have never proved it.

Proving my point..? The misconception is the cash futures affect the market alone. Not true, it requires participation through arbitrage etc but it's not perfectly circular. The underlying asset determines the future price. The only way the future price can circularly affect the underlying asset is by market psychology

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:35:45
You're misunderstanding the problem. When buying from a 3rd party you are putting trust that they are an actual supplier or Trezor or nano products. A modified trezor or nano is not the original and is thus dangerous.
So people would trust walmart as a 3rd party rather than another 3rd party because walmart themselves is unlikely to tamper with distribution. We can't say the same about "cryptoHWwalletcom" or whatever
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:12:50
Buy first educate later. Seems like a winners strategy ������
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:56:12
The drop is not because of Ver. It's because everything is over valued and over bought and you bozos fall for the drama. It's just a narrative.
The reality is that the price increase was irrational... And so will the price decrease. Deal w it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:00:01

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:43
I'm in favor of block size increase for sure
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:47:19
If i sell a fake Trezor, it is not tamper proof any longer. If you cannot verify the 3rd party is actually selling a nano or trezor, then you cannot verify it is tamper proof. For example, the original electronics could be gutted and replaced while keeping the plastic encasing. Plastic is not tamper proof.
That doesn't make being tamper proof useless though. The intention is if I buy a trezor from them officially and then a thief tries to fuck with it and give it back with spying software, it's impossible. But if I can't verify I own a trezor in the first place it doesn't matter

@_date: 2015-06-12 06:20:17
Try bitquick.co. they only ask for your id for purchase above $400.
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:47:11
Haha, no surprise.
Interesting that Mintsy has cryptographically verifiable proof of hashing. 
But the question still remains.. why sell your mining power? 
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:35:01
I see. Those coins being locked up act as deflation tho so somewhat counters the net effect
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:58:57
THIS. 
I respect mining companies that dont sell their shit.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:50:23
Use cash instead at 
Takes just a few minutes, higher limits than circle  or coinbase
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:17:21
Open a new account at a credit union or bank and just accept cash deposits on bitquick.co
Bitquick.co will look for the scams and reimburse u if ur burned

@_date: 2015-06-06 04:58:55
BitQuick does all the scam detection for each transaction and if there is a scam,  they reimburse the user. 
Its helpful as a seller since I dont have to worry about collecting receipt and all that. Bitquick does it instead

I think your comment says a lot about the two sides. 
One side wants to implement a non controversial scaling solution.
The other side literally wants to take over bitcoin lmao.
Ver wants to be satoshi. Fucking douchebag.
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:34:41
There used to be some censorship over here so many, along with myself, starting posting in Now it's literally the opposite. Turns out ver is a pretty power hungry dude and just totally lost it.
When you really think about he is nothing more than an average bozo (who is actually a little on the crazy side) that accidentally got lucky and struck the lottery in a bitcoin investment.
Now people are confusing his wealth for merit... nope. He's just a man. Now he's a corrupted man who actually thinks he is acting altruistic. He probably believes it's his calling or some shit. Takes the bitcoin Jesus thing a little too literally. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:30:37
if u already figured out how to buy btc yourself, just do it.
layman are excited for the ETF because theyre too fuckin stupid to figure out how to buy and secure a personal holdings worth of BTC.
financial players are excited for ETF because they dont have to worry about custody. 
if you're investing $10k into BTC, you might as well buy it yourself.
if you're investing $1M into BTC, I understand why you may want to use an ETF  
Edit: I'm an idiot. Also ETF is great for tax savings via 401k or Ira

Stay safe max.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:13:11
ive used both and theyre different. for your specific case, if you have a libertyx teller near you, use them. itll be cheap and quick for the $100 only.
the differences: libertyx has $500 limit per day, $1500 per 7 days. bitquick has limits of $10k per day, no weekly limits. 
Bitquick asks for ID above $400, and libertyx asks for name, DOB and address for every transaction. 
Libertyx charges 1%, Bitquick charges 2% and whatever the seller's premium is (typically 2% or less)
libertyx is only available in certain states and the store has to know how to use qpay. bitquick is available at major banks and credit unions, so slightly more expansive.
Of course another key difference you cant sell bitcoin to libertyx, but you can sell bitcoin on bitquick.
welcome to bitcoin!

BU has 25% network support. they could hard fork, and theoretically at BEST, BTC loses 25% of its value. BTC-BU will trade at a 1:4 rate of BTC-Core.
Then financial markets must decide between BTC-BU and BTC-Core, and obviously the combined market cap of both would drop due to this uncertainty.
At this point, an ambiguity is created that I honestly imagine will be not as bad as people think, but still much worse than the ETC vs ETH mess (which has ironed out pretty well)

I'm assuming you aren't a developer just like me.
So we're in a frustrating position.
What role do you think users (who arent devs, or market whales or industry players) have in contributing to this conversation, if any?

if venmo added tellers, abra would die lol

Yeah I'd argue long term it's a bad strategy since it hurts the network but maybe the miners are too dumb to realize.. idk. Or other motives 
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:45:08
Core is losing their mind and acting like idiots. Luke jr and lombrozo especially.
It's equivalent to them screaming "reeeeee" because they really don't know what else to do.. they can't HF because it implies defeat. And they can't rally miner or business support because they have no clue how to talk to human beings. 0 social skills.

������ oh yeah the CEO of bitcoin gonna sue me for copyright infringement? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:14:25
and even further.. if only 1 miner is spamming the network, clearly they may lose because they won't mine EVERY block.
however, if ALL the miners agree to spam the network and pay for the spam in accordance to their hashrate distribution, they can increase revenues for all miners across the board.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:00:06
I like the man
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:21:35
yes explain how this doesnt make sense.
flood pool with transaction fee of price X. real users pay greater than x. mine all the fees back. make profit off of the higher price that real users were willing to pay.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:55:42
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:44:21
Higher fees. Miners are intentionally spamming to artificially rise costs. They mine the fees back anyway so they can basically subsidize the spam by whatever their hash rate is.
E.g. if you spend $100 as a miner to spam the network, and your hash power is 30%, you only had to spend $70 to spam the network. If all miners agree to spam attack relative to their hash rate, they can make it even cheaper

but... they are.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:22:22
lol i just made a thread a few minutes ago as this crossed my mind. guess i should have seen ur post.
i think u are correct and this is a major flaw. miners are literally economically incentivized to cooperate with each other to spam the network. not enough spam to kill the network, but it should be enough to keep the network on the edge.
this is bad...
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:46:36
It's spam do not be naive. 
In fact, regardless of blocksize, miners will always be incentived to spam the network to increase fees since they can subsidize a large portion of the tx fees from the spam attack by mining those fees back.
  
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:33:56
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:13:10
ok.. so with that logic, we probably shouldnt do segwit right?
(i think thats nonsense personally)
you can agree or disagree with segwit2x, but these arent hostile entities. i believe they have bitcoin's best interest at heart. w/o segwit2x, we would not have segwit activated. BIP148 would have been a disaster.
the HF may very well be a disaster in November as well, especially if Silbert doesn't back down. ( worst case )
best case is silbert backs down, but this scenario still plays out bad because it will be viewed as "lying" by many of the segwit2x participants.
to reiterate: segwit2x is NOT hostile. theyre a very big group of very helpful companies that contribute to the ecosystem. their voice, as well as yours, are all naturally part of the consensus process.

Title of the article is misleading btw, in no way is it a bitcoin killer.
As others have mentioned, it's a theoretical name of a coin for reference in the paper.
So I imagine bitcoin could implement it just as fast as someone building it from scratch and out competing bitcoin.
At first glance it sounds genius. Tho. 
**tl;dr** instead of it being random who wins the next block reward by being first and wasting a ton of energy, the winner is preselected randomly and is rewarded if they process a full block. One computation. (Someone pls correct me, that's my rough understanding)

Bip148 forced 2x to emerge. Both were necessary. Segwit would not have succeeded without both.

I agree with almost all yours points except for the fact that this is not a justification to lump all segwit2x supporters into the same camp as malicious actors.
Especially Barry. He isn't a miner. I'm still convinced Barry is doing his best effort wether you think he an idiot or not

How deluded can u be to think this is without a reasonable doubt a hostile act?
Literally segwit2x is a compromise effort to scale bitcoin. Wether u agree with them or not they are clearly acting in good faith at face value. Do you think core is the only group capable of developing bitcoin? Do u know how many working implementations there are of the protocol? 
Core overvalues themselves and their bargaining power. Their tactic of strong arming and trolling by dudes like luke-jr is why they r gonna lose control. Smart guys but no idea how to work with people. Shame really.  
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:46:00

im not arguing consistency.
but hes used the same tactics used over here on the btc subreddit as well. he spews emotionally charged rhetoric that makes the divide larger, and actually hurts the classic crowd by detracting from their credibility.
obv core is not innocent either. theyre both guilty of creating these "camps of thought" that prevent real progress and instead result in something akin to repubs vs dems.

Yall are thinking too small.
If mainstream adoption occurs, if ur tech savvy, privacy won't be an issue. We all know how difficult it is to track an intentionally tumbled coin. Bitcoin criminals are inherently smart. 
Now if bitcoin became mainstream,  ud start having more petty and dumb criminals utilizing it thinking its safe. This service would probably let u kno the identity of a wallet if that wallet was being very obvious about who it was.
I doubt this product could do sophisticated analysis because it's too easy to tumble already. And with the add on of sidechains and more protocols, it'll only be easier and easier for those who want privacy  to have it. Those who don't want it or are too stupid to use it can do that too.
Edit: do I like it no? But is it a good business idea? Yup. Is it evil?  Marginally.  But it's inevitable the government steps up its game

I can see user-agents for all outbound connections.
Unfrotunately no inbound connections are showing up.
Even weirder though, I've confirmed I am able to telnet to the machine using the public IP:8333 from an external network... So the port is definitely forwarding, and forwarding to the right machine.. but for some reason, can't accept incoming connections
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:09:40
man.. you are seriously embarrassing yourself. not only is the content of your messages extremely inconsistent, the bigger problem is you simply talk too much.
as a symbol of authority, you need to be careful with your words. people can understand "evolving opinions" to an extent, but you're coming off as utterly uninformed and extremely easy to manipulate.
i understand you mean well for bitcoin, but i hope you take this into consideration. i've never questioned your ethics either. i'm strongly convinced you do not have an agenda. i just leave you this advice because i want you to b a more effective leader. 
at the end of the day, whether you believe the critiques held against you are fair or not, you must admit some degree of fault if you're receiving such an extreme degree of critique at all.
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:46:24
Boi! But what's best way to move forward?
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:38:08
any ideas statoshi? i'm even able to telnet using my public IP:8333 so the forwarding is def working (and i did telnet from within the network using the private IP as well to ensure the correct machine is being routed). and when i test bitnodes.21.co, i see bitnodes trying to connect to my client but no "data" seems to be exchanged.
im not much of a network guy, but it seems like even though a connection can be made, no data can be transfered, if that's even possible 
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:49:00

lmfao wtf
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:04:47
i know, i'm only running the node to help the network. i want inbound connections so i can seed.
im under the impression running a full node with port forwarding enabled is "beneficial to the network"?
also, every port checking site i use out there says that my port 8333 is open for my IP address. yet i still cannot receive inbound connections.
ive also confirmed the port forwarding is configured correctly (port matches the machine) 
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:20:35
luke ur shittin all over my dreams :( lol
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:26:00
Nope, responds with "unreachable".
And like I mentioned in the OP, I can see bitnodes briefly attempt an incoming connection to my node, as the new IP shows up for a second in the debug window as another connection.
im using bitcoin core 0.14 on a raspberry pi 3, pruned=550 dbcache=16

I predict price goes up because ant bleed is fixable. It was discovered before it was exploited.
The damage it did to BU reputation wise is a bullish sign for the market overall. The drop of BU hash rate further plays into that

Honest question: I'm setting up my own node but I'm somewhat nervous to signal UASF for fear of receiving a DDoS. Are my fears unfounded?

@_date: 2018-03-14 15:29:25
This is good you asshats. You want the government to do it instead?
Edit: in theory, this is a decent idea as it shows proactivity to govt and keeps them off. The ball is in our park to ensure the winklevii don't go overboard. They def are trying to make barrier to entry a part of their business plan so it is important to be AWARE of that. They have said this on record before in fact. But since it isn't govt endorsed, we do have the power to tell them to fuck off or not. For now, let's hope for the best but prepare for the worst.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:57:06

no but to be fair you arent gonna use bitcoin for that either unless ur  fanboy. economically, if you live in the usa, theres literally no reason.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:13:07
Insufferable I'm sure
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:35:30
Is it fair to say you lead the project and did have people hired to build much of the code? Because that's impressive. And I think describing you as the developer if you did the work to put all the pieces together is totally fair and accurate description. You never claimed to be a coding prodigy?
And you seem to self describe as an entrepreneur primarily. You were a great entrepreneur. Nothing wrong with leveraging your age country and gender. It's good marketing.
Stay calm, defend yourself in a composed manner, and be as totally straightforward as possible to tell the whole story. The whole story reveals you as an impressive individual. Do not get emotional like the author. Do not get caught up in responding to everything either. Calm and calculated. 
Keep up the good work kid.

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:06:31
honestly the evidence is not really that compelling.. i see more of the narrative "no average 16 yr old can do this!" well duh.. but the point is there are outliers. 
im skeptical as well, but i think thei evidence is at the very least being presented quite poorly. the author of this piece is allowing themselves to be emotional, and detracts from the credibility of the entire work.
On a side note, this thread is despicable.  As a man, I'm embarrassed. Behave yourselves. Calling a 16 year old a harlot? A slut? A whore? What the Fuck? Anyone who would call a 16 year old a bitch is certainly magnitudes less successful than this 16 year old woman ever will be. No established developer or person period would conduct themselves this way.
This is also why were in a bubble. You people have the intelligence of a babboon and bought bitcoin above $10k or even $5k thinking it'd make you rich. Get rekt dumbasses. Prices will continue to fall until all the idiots run away. Like every single bubble we've had. It's lovely

you are a dumb ass and a complete embarassment to our entire community.
this is an open source community. people can choose whatever fork they want to support. just because you have a different opinion, doesnt mean youre evil.
youre no better than some dumbass political pundit villifying the other side.
im with no2x, but damn, its not the end of the world if we HF to 2MB. Core can still keep developing if they want to. nobody is going to run btc1. core can easily start developing a 2mb compatible fork if for some reason the 2x fork goes forward.
all the people youve listed are imperfect individuals who more or less have all TRIED to push this industry forward with best faith efforts. as for you? im not so sure who the hell you are other than some asshole trying to stir the pot

Alright prolly not attacking her but I really do think this entire fiasco is out of hand. I fundamentally disagree with the hit piece and seriously think her age should be considered.

Try bitquick.co next time. Uses cash and you cant get scammed
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:11:59
Core won't allow themselves to die, and they won't get the miners, so they'll have to do something to concede.. I imagine.

@_date: 2015-04-04 12:00:45
Bitquick.co. I'd argue its faster than coinbase since new users xan still buy instantly. U pay via cash
If u prefer bank transfer, try circle.com. They're like a coinbase clone
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:40:19
No surprise,  financial community doesnt respect bitcoin still.

If you have a credit card,  just withdraw cash from an atm and use bitquick.  
It'll be easier than using your card directly cheaper
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:32:21
Fuuug muffins lol
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:02:01

Yo that's savage
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:06:21
Do not use localbitcoins unless you wanna get scammed.
Try 
If you buy, its instant. If you sell, you can get 2-4% more $$ than coinbase or circle would. 
Buy low on coinbase, sell high on bitquick. Good luck!

@_date: 2015-04-04 12:12:30
You just need one of those banks near you,  not to hold an account with any of them. 
You deposit cash directly in a sellers bank account (thus only the seller needs an account)
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:10:05

you can't be scammed at least.

You'll get your btc same day. Easiest way 
Paypal is too risky and expensive (reversability)

No chance u will b able to get $800 of BTC instantly with a cc or bank transfer. Too much fraud risk to the seller
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:01:01
The problem with coinbase and circle is no instant access.  U have to wait 3 to 5 days.  Not good for the horn dogs
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:23:21

all u do is talk shit about bitgo for 4 months. Seems like another coinkite shill.
Mods can't do anything bout it? @_date: 2015-04-04 12:20:59
Essentially yes.
Youd go to your local credit union and deposit cash into someone elses account (a seller on bitquick)
So bitquick is matching you with a seller that has an account at a credit union behind the scenes.
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:12:17
.. u from the future or something?

"No fees". We're not that stupid.
What exchange rate is honored? ??
Edit: pretty sure u can only pay from your Coinbase USD balance. 
Seriously coinbase? Pulling the wool on our eyes?
This is like if PayPal had a debit card. No different. 
This really has no need for bitcoin.

**bullshit.** samson mow is referencing  and i've read it 3x now. nowhere has Core announced formal support for BIP148.
i'm in favor of segwit but not false information.

Your BTC have to be honored at some USD rate before being given to the merchant as USD.
It's not possible to charge that to the merchant.
That's where coinbase can hide any fees. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:17:35
U have to convert your BTC to coinbase USD before spending.
Sorry guy this is no different than PayPal debit card

Look up the hash on blockchain.info. if you find a transaction, bitaddress.org is real. Otherwise, ull need to wait for a confirmation
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:01:02
How can anyone without a bank account now spend bitcoin?  That's not true at all. Coinbase requires a bank account to get verified.
In addition, how does being charged a 1% exchange fee each time you cash out your BTC incentivize you to use BTC?
I don't see the value proposition for everyday consumers. Or at least I don't see it as gentleman. . Just a niche thing

Exactly. And when this is on the front page, casuals assume all bitcoiners are that petty. Ugh
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:13:29
its actually not a convervative plan. keeping both is a conservative plan.
trying to profit from the split in any way is the opposite of conservative.
in reality, BIP148 hashrate may very well be so low it dies. nodes are only 11%. Segwit support is only 33%. So even at 33%, might die off. I kno this doesnt factor in miners switching to the "more profitable" coin tho.

samson mow is not representative of bitcoin core. he was replying to 
that post does not say bitcoin core will support bip148. it is a post by a core dev saying he will personally support bip148. BIG difference
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:21:05
What I'm saying is segwit isn't significantly affecting the centralization issue at all. BU would I believe but that's not my point.

Fireworks.. this is gonna be ugly. Get ready for the bitcoin sale. Err.. whatever "bitcoin" is ��
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:56:00
all business will "support" both versions obviously you clowns.
ull have BIP148Coin or something similar and Bitcoin. unless Core says otherwise, this will be the most common terminology. only if BIP148 coerces miners to greater than 50% is it worthy of being called Bitcoin imo.
for the record, i hope BIP148 succeeds
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:55:40

You must pre-convert your BTC into CoinbaseUSD before u can spend. That's a 1% fee alone. 
How does this card move in the right direction at all?
No non Bitcoiner would ever want this.. no rewards points, requires preloading, sign up fee.. it's bad compared to even some of the mediocre credit cards out there

That's not how regression works. You can't just average the % increase or you'll obviously get ridiculously inflated numbers. Not to mention you extrapolated based on 4 data points.
It would be more correct to extrapolate based on # of tx per day * average size of a tx. 
Not to mention you still literally proved my point that assuming full blocks is WRONG ������

im with you. 
can u elaborate what happens if the miners activate BIP91 but fail to follow BIP141?
currently only 40% is signalling BIP141. Does that mean the 60% not signalling would simply have their blocks orphaned after BIP91, but no split?

Interesting stuff is p10 and on 
The stuff that matters is WHY did they find the DAO tokens to be securities? Because:
* 1. The DAO tokens were sold for money. they define ETH as money. (yay)
* 2. there was an expectation of profit from purchasing DAO tokens
* 3. the profit is expected to be from the managerial efforts of others
i think this is bad news because all 3 can be argued by the SEC for almost any ICO. they can be argued against as well, but as long as an argument can be made for, the SEC will make that argument. and u better have fat $$$ if u wanna argue with the SEC.
basically every ICO out there was sold for ETH, with an expectation that youd make a return if u bought the token, and its bcuz the devs of that token are going to provide all the efforts.
ICOs that want to make an argument against point  would have to make sure all their marketing is towards future users of their platform and not mention anything about the token ever going up in value and only selling it because it gives you access to some feature on the platform. not because it will make u $$$. as long as you can can prove 1/3 points invalid, ur in the clear

meh, i think the hate for blockstream and bitcoin core is way overstated.
roger ver, the BU team and Bitmain have displayed incompetence, unprofessionalism and malicious behavior frequently.
also there is really no purpose to do a HF.. segwit solves the scaling debate by doubling the capacity.. it gives us the capacity we need to continue operating for 5-10 years. why prematurely 4x this 
i think the best thing that happens is segwit2x works to activate segwit, and then hopefully the HF part is abandoned.

itBit and Genesis are exchanges, just like kraken but theyre better for large sums due to their compliance.

If bip148 gets such a low hashrate u can mine with GPU then were ducked.
OP is new here
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:32:54
This. Thank you. This kid is a fuckin douche monger
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:41:53
I agree with OP. First few points are legitimate. Rest is poo
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:13:55
ah, right because its a soft fork they will basically be kicked off the network until they upgrade. theyd have to HF to keep a non-segwit version alive. i think... lol
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:50:54
Lmfao what the fuck bitpay are you stupid
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:21:24
Correct, Gemini and itBit have better consumer protections than Bitstamp assuming you are also a US citizen
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:53:51
VERY good question.
Another question for you... if bitcoin had a favorite color, what would it be? ������
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:33:41
Fair point actually. Carry on !

@_date: 2017-06-01 19:06:49
if this guy couldnt secure a coinbase account wtf makes u think he can secure a private key?
ur argument is irrelevant in this context.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:17:28
That point may be relevant with bigger hash power but not at 0.3%

@_date: 2017-06-09 14:14:35
can anyone chime in? im also curious.
i believe the big thing is u expose urself to exchange hacking risk.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:02:57
Actually bip148 support just acts as insurance to make segwit2x happen. They're compatible. So no problem here.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:19:26
I'm definitely laughing at this guy 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:14:44
$1 trillion market cap doesnt sound that crazy anymore.. lol
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:15:23
He's also an idiot. I love segwit but Samson just says shit.  Don't take his word with any weight
