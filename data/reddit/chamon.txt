If people don’t panic sell, we don’t get a dip. 
If we don’t get a dip, we cant buy the dip.

I don’t know nothing about this but I read on this sub somewhere someone saying that when you “future” (?) you don’t actually buy assets (btc) 
Any can confirm this?

Yeah but prices there are so higgggh 
Any idea why?

Sorry new to all this, not just btc. 
So if a seller with a substantial amount of btc decides to sell at 2k (with the price being right now 4k) he will collapse the market/price?

Good bot
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:16:40
So potentially when we reach the cap limit as Satoshi said, the price will be a lot higher?? 
There will only be 21,000,000 btc in circulation according to the programming is that correct?
