Hate to be that guy, but: 
yet another announcement where other than a pretty website there isn't anything functional released yet, nobody knows the people behind, but the first they do is trying to get money from "investors"...
There is barely any info on the allegedly revolutionary technology but everything is nicely prepared to convince you to already hand over your money.
May be a legit site, but may as well be just someone trying to make a few quick bucks. I wouldn't bet any direction.

What tool would you use to construct and submit the transaction? What are the tools typically used for p2sh?

That was a problem with the bitcoin protocol itself, not with a service built on top of it.
What they are doing now is more akin to hard-forking because an exchange lost their private keys. (which would never happen in the bitcoin world)

The problem is that the ethereum stack is a mess where it is impossible to formally reason about a program. Technically it's true that on the blockchain level everything worked as supposed, but nobody really knew/knows what "as supposed" exactly means.
(also see the discussion not long ago how devs wanted to *restrict* bitcoin's scripting abilities)

The real clusterfuck is how they "solve" it. They are hardforking not because a flaw in the basic protocol but because someone using it fucked up big time.
They just flushed down the toilet any promises about "decentralized", "algorithm-driven", etc. If important people make mistakes, it's going to be rerolled even if that means violating the cryptographic proofs in the chain.
What a massive shitshow.

Reading this at first I was like wtf... then I saw the date.
