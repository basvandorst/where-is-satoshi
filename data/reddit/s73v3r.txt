It's a punishment if you get less of a bonus for no other reason than you'd prefer your bonus in a way that is much easier to pay rent and bills with.

If the business has those kinds of problems, that's a huge red flag.

Yeah, no. Bitcoin would do fuck all for those people, except force them to have another step between paying rent and buying groceries.

I'm guessing anyone who would be interested in this would already have direct deposit set up, thus avoiding ask those problems already.

How can it be legal to basically punish someone who doesn't want to use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-01 06:16:22
They have the option of choosing Bitcoin, or "choosing" to take a lower bonus in regular money.
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:00:30
The thing is that those who don't want to use Bitcoin get less of a bonus. There is no way you can spin that as being fair.

And you think one of those places is going to set up Bitcoin payments?

Because it fucks everyone else on the exchange over. While the person selling the coins might not care, the others on the exchange do, and those that run the exchange definitely should, as it will cause people to leave the exchange.

I maintain that the reason for Bitcoin price fluctuations are because some people with a lot of Bitcoin want to keep doing this meme.

This happens all the time on other major exchanges. The idea is that these trades never would have happened if someone hadn't done this in the first place. 
And it's a lot better than knowing that someone can just completely fuck a market like this. If you're not just a speculator, this is a good thing.

OS X has no walled garden. They have an app store, which is only one way to get apps on the machine.

You can do whatever you want on a Mac. Nothing is stopping you.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:37:39
Because if the developers aren't making money, they're not going to support their apps, and they're not going to bring new apps to the platform.

Ummm, no. It is NOT common for a PR firm to sue someone who complains of having a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:36:01
No more or less stupid to choose one platform over the other.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:41:37
Good for you. And everyone else will give exactly zero fucks.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:52:38
You're a fucking idiot if you don't think that every other company in the world doesn't care about profit margins, either.

Except people who work at NASA. Having a full UNIX workstation as my laptop, especially one that can be serviced in just about any decent sized city in the country is quite nice.
