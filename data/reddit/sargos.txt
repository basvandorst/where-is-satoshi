Too bad Gemini doesn't operate in Wisconsin.

Which bank or country gets to run this database? The reason we can't answer that question is the reason it's never been done before and why blockchains are so disruptive.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:19:32
That doesn't make any sense. The banks exist, neither you and the person you replied to implied otherwise. So "if you're going to have a bank" is true because, yes, there is a bank. They are all banks.
But someone would need to host and control that database. The banks fight over that and don't trust each other. So, no, a traditional database is not better in this situation and that's the entire reason Ripple exists.
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:28:58
Or we can just switch to a newer generation of technology that uses exponentially less power to run. Proof of work was good as a proof of concept but its usefulness has run its course.

No idea

These are the kinds of posts that give cryptocurrency its bad reputation.
@_date: 2018-08-10 19:19:56
Oops. I think I was supposed to reply to the other guy. His "bitcoin will need to consume the entire global economy" line looks like he's conflating market cap with total money in the economy.
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:03:52
The argument that "There will be a recession soon because there hasn't been one in a while" is a pretty bad one. It's been wrong countless times. It's up to you to address that fact and not to everyone else for just stating the obvious.
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:41:44


Only one of those is true
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:11:17
Using a log chart is akin to lying
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:11:31
You need to learn what market cap is. Market cap doesn't mean that there's actually $110 million invested into Bitcoin. Market cap just the last traded price * number of coins. The number is inflated.
If the total crypto market cap becomes 1 trillion dollars that DOES NOT MEAN that 1 trillion dollars of currency was put into the market. It's likely more like 300-400 million.

You know the economy and money isn't real right? Right? The laws of physics don't apply to them.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:05:29
Bitcoin is stuck where it is when it comes to development. It's not going to be stealing any good ideas or making any big changes as they would be too controversial and the miners wouldn't allow it.

Buying BNB right now is like buying BTC when it was 15,000. Risky as hell.

I doubt many people would call billion dollar valuations obscure.
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:58:31
Other major coins are just as secure as Bitcoin. That's kind of the whole foundation of crypto and if they weren't secure then hackers would be stealing money left and right.

I have my 401k at Fidelity. Can I buy Bitcoin with it somehow?
@_date: 2019-12-29 06:05:51
How does that work? Do they not do KYC? I'm not sure how that's legal and I feel like they will be shut down eventually.
@_date: 2019-02-06 04:32:00
Blooming. Onion.
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:36:22
That's why I asked how it works. It says instant and there's not much instant about doing KYC.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:09:45
Hmm. I didn't catch that part. He wouldn't know about encryption and store the keys right next to the encrypted file right? I feel like that was a typo.
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:03:00
If you encrypt them then you're good to go. You actually have the safest and most foolproof method of storing your keys.
The encryption means that even if someone gets access to your cloud account they wouldn't be able to get the keys at all.
Cloud means that your keys are safe even if your house burns down or your wallet is stolen.
You could arguably move your keys to a bank deposit vault but now you're back to trusting a third party.
Just keep doing what you're doing. You're already at the top of the security ladder.

They can also lawfully force you to open your hardware wallet.


Your steel can also be stolen or lost.
It's not a slam dunk. Having the piece of mind that your private keys can not be destroyed, lost, or stolen is a much better benefit.

There aren't even any good Japanese smartphones being made anymore. I feel like you're just nostalgic for the 90s.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:56:39
You're right. Bitcoin is the network that future companies like Apple are built on top of so the real Bitcoin value will higher than the individual companies it supports. This does further cement OPs point.

One is folding and one is Xing, duh
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:13:03
It's turns out to be 80 fold as an X fold requires each of the four corners to fold inwards for one full fold. Repeat that fold 20 times and you have a 20 * 4 fold. Now take the current value of a fold and you have the resulting depth of your initial investment.

lol. Why did you skip Tron and Bitconnect? Round out that portfolio.
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:42:17
Yes. People don't want to believe this but there will be no mass adoption until it's as easy as swiping a credit card or buying Bitcoin in your 401k. People can barely keep their email account safe. They aren't going to install Linux and deal with super long random text that secures their retirement funds.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:02:20
I'm not sure if you were saying he had a good point or were being sarcastic because Bitcoin can no longer hard fork to implement those changes. Either way it works I guess for different groups of people so double the upvotes.
