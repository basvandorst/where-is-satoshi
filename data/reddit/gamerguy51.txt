Get an iPad, download coinomi wallet...it takes all kinds of crypto.  Or Exodus
It has clean interface and easy use.
Buy a lockable mount from RAM MOUNTS.  
Post your wallet address at all tables and sections of the bar. When yiu get paid the wallet will send notification.
Now batch to coinbase once or twice a week and cash out.
