I hope cryptocurrencies and Carl both die a slow and painful death. I'd settle for a fast one as well.

Spending a little over a grand CAD for a rig with a gtx 1030 is a sick and twisted joke.

All your slave trade brothers will be worth all the more too due to demand.. then after they are old and decrepit, we will sell them on ebay! Mwahahaha!
As a lifelong gamer, the creation of etherium hit me right in the feels. And my friend who's gpu died recently..
