There are alts with legitimate business models, massive corporate partnerships, and private funding from well respected investors. You really think these companies have no inherent value? Or that they will somehow evaporate if Bitcoin fails? 
Yes, the shitcoins will ultimately fail, but that will happen with or without the success of Bitcoin. If you don't have an understanding of the crypto ecosystem then I urge you to take a deeper look.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:12:42
Doesn't matter how much you put in since % gain is the same. If you put in 100 and it grows 10x, then you have $1000; if you put $1000 it grows 10x then you have $10,000, and so on. So just start wherever you're comfortable.
r/cryptocurrency is a good resource, though at times it seems that the users forget that noobs exist and we would shouldn't expect them to know everything we take for granted. If you could find someone willing to help that would be great, otherwise start by first reading into what cryptocurrencies actually are and how they work (things like block chains, private/public keys, wallets, transactions), then figure out how to get money in the system (if you are US based, then coinbase is the most popular option, though they get a lot of criticism because their customer service can't keep up with the influx of new users). Once your money is in coinbase, then you can purchase one of their crypto offerings (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash). Other cryptos that you would want will be listed on other exchanges, so to get those you will need to purchase Ether (or bitcoin) from coinbase, send it to another exchange, and trade for the crypto that you want. 
If you're also at the point where this all makes sense and you want investing advice, I can suggest some "blue chip" cryptos that have more dominant positioning in the market. Of course nothing is a sure thing, especially with an industry so young, but the one certainty is that the technology will revolutionize different industries. You can play it "safe" by betting on the companies with certain advantages that give higher likelihoods of disrupting the industry, or you can bet on the less popular coins and hope that the one you choose will reward you with 10x or 100x (these we refer to as "shitcoins").

I'm surprised it's actually that low, I was paying $11 and $17 the other day.
If you're wanting to move small amounts of crypto then you should look into a coin more suited for micro transactions. Bitcoin is just a "store of value" for the moment, as well as the standard trading pair in exchanges.

True, alts are offsetting my btc holdings right now and providing slow growth while btc tanks. There are so many good projects out there too that are technologically way more appealing than btc. I think btc desperately needs a working lightening network or the price will continue to fall as investors are tired of being tied to a broken product as the future is happening around them.

Easy for us to say, but I can definitely sympathize with anyone who bought into the recent FOMO. Imagine buying in at 19k and watching this happen...

Well nearly everyone can agree that Bitcoin is shit in its current state, but it is not a shitcoin because it's THE bitcoin. BCH is just bitcoin with larger blocks?? That's it? Old generation technology with a band-aid approach to solve immediate scaling issues. If you want instant and free tx, why not just use RaiBlocks? What utility will BCH bring in a year or two from now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:24
Definitely not. You could max out your daily/weekly withdrawals I guess but that will still take some time. Probably smart to use some of that btc as venture capital or find anyone willing to accept btc for property.

Beginning of the month everyone was rejoicing with the 'over 9000' memes, and even then 9000 seemed like a hell of a milestone.
Now all the coinbase noobs are freaking out with their 13k-20k positions and trying to save what money they still have left by selling something that they didn't even understand in the first place.
Yet here we are, at 13500... still up 65% in a month...

No but depending on the wallet you are using, there might be a way to add on to the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:28:29
Look here to see how much in fees the unconfirmed tx have paid: 
So if you want to sell your bitcoin right now, then I would suggest sending a 400-500 sat/byte fee, otherwise you may be waiting for a while. Though I recommend not paying that outrageous fee and just holding until things blow over.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:32:29
Not with the current alt market. Buy literally any alt coin, wait a few days, buy back into btc.

I only purchased bitcoin to play online poker in college... Sold all of my earnings when it went to $200 and was blown away thinking how smart I was.
If I would have just taken 10 minutes to read about bitcoin and understand what I was actually purchasing, I would have fallen for bitcoin instantly and purchased and held as much as I could afford. 
My prize possession is a screen shot of an 80 bitcoin pot that I won with a straight flush lol. but I still bought back in during the run up last May so I'm doing alright... just not a millionaire like I could have been lol

You could give back to the crypto community by investing in non-ICO projects with ambitious goals, then using the profits from those investments for charitable donations.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:17
If you're patient you can deposit USD into coinbase at no fee (will take 7-10 days if I remember correctly), then you can use their exchange (GDAX) to buy btc at a lower price and without a fee if you buy using a limit order.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:55:15
You only pay tax when you realize the gain (cashing out from crypto to fiat). So none of the trades matter, what matters is the amount of profit that hits your bank account. 
Also if you did not make a profit, you owe nothing and can use it as a deduction on future gains.
I could be wrong but this is what I have been lead to believe.

Sorry to hear that but if it means anything coming from an internet stranger, I have 100% confidence that all coins will rebound and you will eventually see a return on your investmetent. In the past day I'm down five figures lol... but it doesn't even phase me at this point. Maybe since my initial investment was so low compared to current prices, but moreso that I have complete faith in the future of crypto.
I would advise against making investment decisions from Reddit posts, but my advice is to just weather the storm and never sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:35
Any special picks you have? Holding way too much bitcoin in my portfolio with the recent price surge so I'm trying my best to diversify.
Also, what issue do you have with XBY? I think the network design is definitely interesting and am looking forward to seeing the testnet numbers, but I think they do a terrible job at explaining the network and is nearly impossible for any non-technical investors to understand. But just looking at the number of blockchain platforms that exist on the top-100 makes me think that XBY could at least enter that range if the testnet and mainnet go as planned.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:04:35
Alt coin back to btc. But I haven't gone back to btc because I needed to diversify after the huge btc run in the past couple of months, and there are a lot of promising alts out there.
And do you mean which exchanges? Binance, cryptopia, kucoin, etherdelta, bitgrail (just for xrb).
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:02:06
Bought in to XRB last week but my coins are still stuck on mercatox lol... luckily got more today at $3 from bitgrail.
I'll take a look at hive. Saw wabi when it first got listed but wasn't sure when would be good to jump in, but considering the success of VEN and Walton, it definitely has room to improve. Also looking at MOD since it's another logistics type of application with even lower mkt cap than Wabi.

200,000+ unconfirmed right now with 300+ sat minimum to be included in the next block... last time it was close to this number was early November during the 'flippening'. The network is clogged right now due to FOMO, imagine what would happen if a FUD event takes place right now... I would imagine anywhere from 300-500k unconfirmed tx with people paying $200-$300 to panic sell their coins.

@_date: 2018-05-20 18:54:30
Had a similar thought but couldn't find any solution with it. Maybe a printout would help.
'easily' is in the circle on the bottom right side
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:38:45
This is the assumption I'm working off of: "transaction costs almost lost users" is part of a longer message, where a pair of seed words are somehow related to each word in the message. So if there are 12 words in the message, that makes 24 seed words (12 pairs). 
I have represented each clue pair and message word as ascii/hex/binary, where the value is the sum of digits in the encoded representation. For example:
binary_sum('code') = 17 and binary_sum('easily') = 25, so the total sum is 17+25 = 42. I have also tried it as '1725', as well as 15 (1+7+2+5).
The thought is that a pair's sum will match the sum of a word in the message, but I am finding no patterns whatsoever with this process.
Have also tried drawing all types of lines connecting the pair representations, but still nothing.
Maybe the pair representations are polar coordinates? But what would a (17, 25) coordinate even mean in this instance when there's no indication of what unit of measure to use in this image?
I have also decoded the hex strings of the transaction block containing the 00212121 transaction... no hidden messages.
Is anyone actually any closer than they were a week ago? Just feels like a wild goose chase at this point. I am spending too much time on this and will have to retire unless we get another clue that brings any amount of clarity.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:13:06
even if it was generated, there could still be another layer added that connects the words some how. Also suspicious is the "&lt;=" character, like it's pointing at something.
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:22:11
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:05:04
you can choose your own seed words, which is likely the case if we are supposed to search for a seed phrase.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:56:44
I don't completely follow - some of the words you draw the line angled how the word is angled, but others it's drawn at a different angle (easily, sign, want, risk).
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:12:23
Give thought. Here clues. 2048172- $*( No solve?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:28:58
Well someone else here claims that the passphrase to the empty wallet is the 'first step', and you have to go beyond that.
Maybe he's right or maybe it's just not the right seed phrase, who knows. But if you're feeling generous or want to collaborate then let me know the approach you used :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:48:53
Yes you can run the permutations through a program, but if all you have are the words and no indication of order, then you will probably not solve this within your lifetime.
But if you narrow down the words to a manageable list and have clues on order, then I can run it through a script I modified to check for valid keys.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:01:27
Do we have a definitive list of the valid bip39 words in the circle? I counted 58, but may have missed something:
['air', 'trust', 'race', 'sign', 'problem', 'model', 'order', 'tail', 'gap', 'use', 'end', 'run', 'main', 'agree', 'stay', 'one', 'almost', 'must', 'pool', 'find', 'issue', 'want', 'ability', 'zero', 'just', 'open', 'this', 'easily', 'online', 'next', 'since', 'early', 'still', 'law', 'define', 'place', 'risk', 'way', 'code', 'provide', 'rely', 'entire', 'paper', 'able', 'split', 'speed', 'cash', 'old', 'proof', 'course', 'attack', 'power', 'fee', 'know', 'post', 'like', 'modify', 'come']
all words in circle:
['creator', 'air', 'spreads', 'possibility', 'cpu', 'free', 'new', 'weaknesses', 'trust', 'race', 'sign', 'honest', 'proves', 'avoided', 'steps', 'problem', 'serves', 'model', 'order', 'pay', 'timestamp', 'odds', 'based', 'chain', 'hes', 'tail', 'fate', 'gap', 'use', 'end', 'ips', 'run', 'largest', 'main', 'wei', 'agree', 'stay', 'one', 'almost', 'transaction', 'must', 'pool', 'checks', 'nonce', 'take', 'willing', 'user', 'go', 'surfers', 'serving', 'find', 'sellers', 'issue', 'solves', 'want', 'ability', 'zero', 'just', 'benefits', 'per', 'open', 'far', 'this', 'arrived', 'items', 'disputes', 'hashing', 'easily', 'online', 'ram', 'next', 'blocks', 'sum', 'fast', 'since', 'issued', 'node', 'early', 'wary', 'ccs', 'still', 'law', 'kept', 'define', 'int', 'place', 'took', 'risk', 'well', 'lead', 'way', 'inherent', 'lost', 'code', 'block', 'provide', 'rely', 'care', 'nodes', 'dont', 'entire', 'paper', 'cent', 'able', 'every', 'counts', 'existed', 'split', 'came', 'falls', 'speed', 'purely', 'cash', 'dai', 'thin', 'without', 'old', 'earlier', 'proof', 'transactions', 'tie', 'course', 'anonymous', 'users', 'absence', 'fanout', 'costs', 'attack', 'power', 'really', 'currency', 'structure', 'exclusively', 'past', 'fee', 'internet', 'names', 'know', 'root', 'post', 'attacker', 'like', 'slower', 'modify', 'come']

I wish we could get a clear answer on if this is something that is visibly apparent once we crack the code, or if computational effort is required to derive the key. Otherwise most of us are just wasting our time.

@_date: 2018-05-21 19:25:26
find anything hidden there? hex conversion on the raw block data turns up nothing, same with the next block (+1 clue). Not sure how else someone can hide a message.
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:27:48
yep... pretty sure there's a sentence in here that makes sense. maybe each pair translates to a word in the sentence, but I can't find any patterns.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:30:42
definitely a summation symbol. so the only thing out of place that we know of is the notdef glyph?
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:42:57
I'm currently stuck on the idea that the word pairs translate  to numbers. The digits 0-9 are all inside of the circle, and I don't think this is coincidence. I have tried encoding the words with both their ascii and hex values, but have no idea what to do with the numbers.
For example, 'code easily' have hex values of 36 and 65. What do we do with this? Draw lines connecting the numbers? Take that shape and move it onto the X? I don't get it.
Some simple python functions if anyone finds this useful:
     summer
    def ascii_sum(word):
        return sum([ord(x) for x in word])
     
     summer
    def hex_sum(word):
        hexstr = ''.join([hex(ord(x)) for x in word])
        hexsum = sum([int(x) for x in hexstr if x.isdigit()])
        return hexsum
     
     summer
    def bin_sum(word):
        binstr = ''.join(format(ord(x), 'b') for x in word)
        binsum = sum([int(x) for x in binstr])
        return binsum
Also had the idea that word pairs are anagrams of a seed word, but that didn't lead anywhere useful:
     solver
    def solve(words):
        res = []
        for word in words:
            if any([x in pair[0] for x in word]) and any([x in  pair[1] for x in word]) and all([x in ''.join((pair[0],pair[1])) for x in word]):
                res.append((pair, word))
        for r in res:
            print('{}=={}'.format(r[0], r[1]))

It was? Back then people used it because you could send crypto faster to darkenet markets, gambling sites, or exchanges lol. I didn't know anyone was using it as a testnet for Bitcoin. I'm not really even sure what that means since LTC had a non-zero value, so that's one expensive testnet...

@_date: 2018-06-11 20:33:59
I have the same thoughts. People are dumb and need a dead simple interface without even hearing the words "lightning network" or "channels". Replies to these concerns are always paragraphs of how it's not really hard for the user once they understand certain concepts and perform certain actions... come on, that's never going to reach mass adoption.
I think LN could work but it needs layers of abstraction masking the technicals to where the only things the user thinks are "account balance, pay, receive". 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:16:20
Trade off is that you don't have to use a decade old technology? 
If anyone really thinks btc/lightning network is the best and only solution, please read into some sources outside of this sub. I have only love for Bitcoin and want it to suceed, but this place is an echo chamber for uninformed opinions and baseless statements like "nothing else can even compare" or whatever op said.

If a the lowest price a buyer is asking for is $7000, then a market order would buy from that seller immediately at the $7000 price, with a fee. Instead, you can set a limit order to $6999, so now you're waiting for someone who wants to sell to come in and place a market order to sell his coin to you at $6999, with no fees for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:13:36
No, it's not normal, the network can't handle the amount of transactions that have been sent over the past few days. Just wait a few days for everything to clear up and the fees will go back to the usual $3-$5 (which is still ridiculously high, but they are working on it).
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:48:49
If you're not using an automated system that's been trained or at least backtested on historical data, then don't try to play the market or you will just lose.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:38:08
We don't need mass adoption right now; we need a scalable network with low fees and fast transaction times. Investment money is pouring in faster than the development can keep up... more users just allows bad actors to manipulate btc holders to sabotage the network, like what we saw over the weekend
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:21:32
$250 is a cheap lesson to learn, considering that millions just vanished with the BCH dump the other day.
Next time if you ever find yourself in a hurry to make a trade, don't make that trade. Just wait it out until the dust settles and you can think more logically. And understand that most of the advice you read on here or r/btc is agenda driven, and they generally have no clue what they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:53:39
But those companies actually have quarterly revenue reports and sell products used globally. BTC on the other hand is hyper inflated by pure speculation - the price that investors are valuating it at far exceeds the capabilities of the actual network (at this point in time). I have no doubt that BTC will be massive in the long-term, but the past few days have shown us that investors are clueless about what they are buying, to the point where enough of them can be manipulated with fear to sabotage the network, without knowing that their actions are doing harm to their own investment. Does that really sound like a commodity that's worth its current price?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:09:50
Maybe. It's kind of sad to see that a massive volume of btc holders do not actually understand what they are holding and are panicking to sell everything for another coin that they don't understand. The fear driving market cap is ridiculous right now. Funny to think that the inefficiency with mining/tx fees in an exodus situation like what started yesterday might actually be a safeguard for btc, since it's giving people time to realize that btc isn't actually going anywhere and bch isn't actually going to surpass btc overnight. So once their transactions clear, maybe they don't dump everything they have for bch since that idea doesn't seem so smart anymore.
In terms of tech, I don't see how increasing the block size is anything more than a band-aid. Yes, it works and works well, but you're still adding bloated data into blocks, and the lack of optimization is not a sign of good engineering but more of a quick fix solution. I mean, if increasing the block size is the solution that can support billions of transactions a day, then why didn't core just implement it yesterday?
It's still scary though because at this point in time btc is broken until they implement solutions that will fix the current issues, but these solutions are really designed for scaling down the road. But what happens in the meantime if bch can convince the majority of users that their coin is the 'real' bitcoin, and get exchanges to change the ticker to 'btc' and they drop the 'cash' part? This is why the attack window for bch is right now, while btc is impractical to use (and unusable for smaller transactions). Core obviously has a much better long-term solution to bitcoin scaling, but that doesn't mean they will win or even have the ability to implement their vision.

I'm seeing between 20 to 40 tx/s...
But the backlog was at 180k yesterday, right? Over 200k the day before. I guess it's making progress but we're not finding blocks fast enough.
What are people doing right now with their btc anyway? I assume the panic is mostly gone, why are they still sending transactions just to have them pile on to the rest of the unconfirmeds and have to wait days for them to go through?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:35:13
Yeah, it's funny, but this really isn't the best way to represent the community. Something has to change at some point if we want new users to feel welcomed and comfortable enough to take the dive into crypto.

If you send BTC to GDAX after the split, then all you will have is BTC. I'm assuming they will have a B2X deposit address, and the ledger wallet might update so you have an option to send coins over the 2x chain.

No one is going to use it as money when the transaction fees are $3-5 on a good day... Most BTC holders are fine with waiting for the network upgrades that will allow btc to scale and deal with mempool congestion and high fees, but you can't really blame people for not wanting to use btc for every day transactions at this point.
The advice for this point in time is to STOP moving your btc. We need to clear up this damn mempool or the entire network remains at risk.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:18:59
Well... it is funny lol.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:52:09
Only problem is if you want to be locked into the current btc price, you need to buy from coinbase. If you want to buy at some point in the near future, then you can deposit USD into GDAX and wait for that to clear (takes up to a week), then purchase on GDAX to avoid fees (but remember that market orders will charge a fee, limit orders are free). 
Also look into getting your own wallet to hold your coins. There have been some major exchange hacks that have stolen everyones btc, as well as exchanges collapsing, so those of us who have been here for a while are very cautious with exchanges.
The main concept to understand as a beginner is that your wallet does not actually 'hold' your coins, it protects your private key which is basically your proof that you own the coins linked to that key. The coins are always on the network, so a wallet manages your private/public keys and allows you to interact with the network.
Also, most importantly, when creating a new wallet make sure you write down the seed phrase on a piece of paper, not on your computer. This phrase is an encrypted version of your private key (the thing that controls all of your coins), so if you ever lose your computer or phone, you can just download a new wallet and import your private key there using the seed phrase, and that new wallet will now reflect your btc balance. If you lose the seed phrase and you lose your wallet, then your coins are gone forever, so it's extremely important to have it written down in a place where no one can find it or hack into it.

I've been really lucky with the exchanges... had my btc on btc-e at the time of the gox disaster, had my coins on bittrex at the time of the btc-e closure.
I don't trade much anymore, but if I do I try to get it in and out of the exchange as quick as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:08:09
Since you have over $10k worth of coins you might as well spend the 80 bucks and get a hardware wallet. I use a ledger nano s but I hear the trezor work just as well. I'm not sure about trezor support for XRP but you can store them on the ledger.
I don't know much about jaxx but it looks like they have an iOS app... if you're running the app in an iOS environment then it should be secure, since iOS is a pretty restrictive operating system and a highly unfeasible target for spyware. But still, just get a hardware wallet and it will at least make you feel safer.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:11:44
Yeah the fees have gone down drastically but there are still 10 of thousands at under 100sat/byte that are still waiting, as well as some people still using a 800+sat/byte fee for whatever reason. But there are 88k unconfirmed now, so a 12k reduction since 6 hours ago when I made that post - seems promising.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:49:30
Thats one of the biggest questions for all cryptocurrencies, and why there is a debate in the community on the best way to scale bitcoin or other networks in general.
BTC has been having issues for a long time and have not yet implemented the proposed solutions, but are promising that they will come soon. People are buying BTC without actually understanding what it is or the state of its development at a faster pace than the development can keep up, so this is why we're here right now. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) made a simple fix to make the network handle transactions a lot easier, but the criticism is that it's a crude solution that will not scale well with mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:25:09
I've been buying BTC since 2013 so I'm in it for the long haul, but what's happened over the weekend has been the first time that I'm actually worried. If a group of bad actors can manipulate investors to jam the network that they are a part of, does that not scare you? Everyones coins were literally frozen unless you wanted to pay upwards of $100 in fees. A commodity where investors are easily panicked and your coins are not as liquid as you thought - sounds like a risky investment.
It's just looking like the majority of new money that's pumped btc does not actually understand the technology, otherwise there wouldn't have been enough panic to bring the pending transactions near 200,000... Though the silver lining is that BTC prices did not even fall that much during the whole fiasco, and even started recovering soon after, which is a huge boost of confidence in my eyes.
I'm just saying that in it's current iteration, the btc network is overvalued. There's nothing wrong with that, and no one is saying it can't stay afloat, but come on... $6000+ for a coin that can't even be used in microtransactions because the fee is higher than the transaction? It's pure speculation and the development hasn't yet caught up to the price. I'd be happier if the speculation was based on the potential of the btc network as a transformative tech, but it seems like there's just a ton of FOMO.
Long-term I'm still very bullish, so as long as core can scale correctly and hold off attacks in the meantime, then we're still in the very early prices of btc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:45:57
It was going to go down anyway. I'm surprised it's not even lower right now. If you invest in bitcoin you need to take a long position, not expecting to make a quick profit. If you invested only because you are afraid of bitcoin taking off, but you don't know what bitcoin actually does or the root of what's causing the drop right now, then you should probably do some reading into the subject before investing. 
But from my perspective I can tell you that I'm not making any moves, and am not too nervous about the drop.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:09:26
Basically put your btc into any alt during December/early Jan and you would easily 2-3x

So what's the user flow? They create an LN wallet then can buy anything they want instantly with LN processes being abstracted away? I need to read more into this but from the surface it just looks so convoluted for the end user, unless it actually works in the way I described. Adoption is key if Bitcoin will survive, so it needs to be as simple as possible for the user. Otherwise a DAG coin will take over with on-chain scaling and instant tx. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:17:23
I wouldn't say "totally untrue" unless you can qualitatively prove that statement. If you are OK with a sidechain solution like LN, then fine, maybe it will work in the long run. But for on-chain peer to peer transactions, blockchain just doesn't work when it comes to scaling. DAGs are the best attempt we have right now, and the tech is infinitely better in terms of scalability and speed. Though every DAG coin right now is highly experimental, there's no way you can argue that blockchian works better than DAG for a network of p2p transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:18:47
For future reference, bitcoin is not stored "in" any wallet or device, the 2 BTC you have are simply linked to your public bitcoin address. If you had saved your private key (or string of words encoding your private key), then you could just download a new wallet, import your private key, and gain access to those 2 BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:07:28
But bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic worthlessness; it's intrinsic value is given by decentralization, distribution, and the benefits of a blockchain structure. Most people are missing out on the actual technological achievements that are making this whole crypto thing possible and just see bitcoin as a speculative asset no different than a stock with high volatility. Big investors are not dumping money into crypto because it's a highly volatile asset with no intrinsic value - that actually sounds like a terrible investment. They are dumping money because it's the future of money, and they can see it already beginning to transform their own industry.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:07:45
Do you even understand blockchain and the inherent benefits provided by the tech? Or do you see bitcoin as nothing more than "digital money"? Blockchain is not about "medium of exchange" or "store of value", it's a data structure that is primed to disrupt multiple industries. If you don't like Bitcoin, fine, I don't like it much either (in its current development state - but no one really does), but at least provide some discussion points. What you're saying shows you have no deeper understanding of the actual topic at hand, especially when you equate all of "crypto" as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:40:20
This shows how many transactions are waiting to be confirmed at different fee amounts, and an estimate of how long it will take: 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:36:48
Read the first one or two chapters if you want to gain an intuition on how bitcoin works: 
Cryptocurrency won't crash and burn. Price will continue to fluctuate with heavy volatility but that's due to market manipulation and big money trying to milk the early days of crypto for all it's worth.
It's possible in the future that bitcoin could lose popularity and its value could crash, but this would be caused by political or technological issues with the project, resulting in money leaving bitcoin and flowing into another cryptocurrency that's ready to take its place. At that point we would all have fair warning and ample time to exchange our bitcoin for the new bitcoin-replacement coin. Though I'm still betting on BTC being the big dog for years to come.
Once you wrap your head around the blockchain data-structure and the implications of a fully distributed and decentralized network, then you can see how bitcoin is simply technological progression applied to a monetary system. If you believe that progress is inevitable, then you shouldn't be worried about the high volatility. These are still early days and the difference between buying a coin at $3000 or $5000 will likely be negligible in the distant future.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:16:32
No. 80,000 BTC * 5,000 USD/BTC = $400,000,000 USD
Bitcoin market cap at the moment is nearly $90,000,000,000. So that would just be a sale amounting to 0.4% of the total market cap. So no, the price wouldn't crash.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:55:41
Well I'm sure someone else could make a more elaborate write up, but the basic idea is that bitcoin is a virtual currency existing on top of a network of nodes that each contain the entire history of every bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place, along with all metadata. This 'distributed' type of network makes it impenetrable to attackers - if they take down one node then the whole network already exists on thousands of other nodes, and anyone can just download the network and run a full node themselves.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies employ a 'blockchain' data structure - basically a public ledger that keeps track of all transactions that have occurred. Before a transaction is added to the ledger, it has to pass advanced cryptographic treatment that ensures that the transaction is legitimate. Certain nodes are constantly running algorithms to verify the legitimacy of each transaction (these are called 'miners', and get rewarded in bitcoin every time they are able to prove that a transaction is legitimate). This makes is near impossible to cheat the network (counterfeit bitcoin, spending the same bitcoin in two places, etc.), and we can have full trust that the transactions appearing on the blockchain are legitimate.
Finally, the whole network is decentralized. There are no banks or institutions where you have to give them your money and just trust that they will protect it. No banking fees, no waiting days for transactions to clear. All it costs is a small fee on every transaction so that the miners can be rewarded for their work (the fee right now is actually relatively high due to growing pains in the network, but in the future the fee should be negligible with every transaction).
From an economics perspective, you may want to read into deflationary (bitcoin) vs inflationary (dollar) currencies. 
So the 'purpose' of bitcoin is simply applying technological advancement to the monetary system in the form of decentralization and distributed computing. And we are still just talking about bitcoin, not any of the other crypto assets created to employ blockchain, decentralization, distributed computing, to transform other industries and sectors. Very exciting technological space at the moment with huge transformative power.

Research what? I've been buying btc since 2011 and understand the general concepts behind blockchain tech, but I am a developer in another field so I can't spend my time focusing on all the non-technical drama that floods these forums. Just asking that people provide some damn evidence when they make a claim.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:19:24
Is there a place I can read about all of these arguments from a technical perspective? I don't have the time to follow all of this damn drama every day and these forums are just spammed with people saying "this is bad! don't do this!". How does that help anyone? Is there a more informative subreddit to follow where we can actually learn what's going on?

It would be very easy for Twitter to implement a filter to catch these types of scams and at least hide the text or attach some warning.

Well that's my experience. I feel like this sub is the equivalent of the donald for bitcoin, with a few insightful posts sprinkled around. Couldn't stand this place during the Aug 1 split when there was so much needless hostility. r/btc just seems so much more welcoming and accepting of actual discussion. Nothing to do with btc/bch, just my personal experience on both subs.

No, the recovery phrase is an encoding of your private key, so that it's easier to remember or write down than a long string of random characters. The private key is literally the monetary value that you hold. The wallet is just there to manage the private key and protect it from being revealed.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:56:44
I just moved mine right now... It's not showing anything pending on my desktop wallet so the transaction hasn't even started propagating through the network. I'm not sure why coinbase has stalled the withdraws; it's not like they don't have the funds available.
If it's still in this state when the fork happens then we don't get the BCC, because coinbase will not have sent us our coins yet.
*edit - My guess is that so many people are withdrawing their BTC, that they need to pull funds from their cold storage, which requires people in different geographical locations to gather funds from safe deposit boxes. I hope they are working diligently on this and get it resolved over the weekend. They should have really prepared better for this.

Don't feel bad. Before getting back into it recently, I sold all my coin years ago the first time it went in the $200-300 range. Don't even want to think about how much I could have made if I held. I was playing online bitcoin poker with what would turn out to be $1000 hands lmao. I'm sure many others did the same.
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:38:11
I guess it would matter if it has at last one confirmation to get placed into the last block before the fork. If coinbase broadcasts the transaction, then the fork occurs before any confirmation, then the first confirmation occurs, that will place the transaction in the first block ahead of the fork, right? I'm not sure.
