I did a quick search on the fella Robert Shiller who won a noble prize in the article. Basically, he came up with the idea of the Price to Earnings ratio. [This article]( talk about how if the P/E is above the long term average of 16 or above, then the stock is over valued. 
But what he doesn't understand is that with crypto-currencies, it's not a stock, it's a network. Networks act differently than stocks. The value comes from how maybe people are connect to it. 
I suspect he's trying to use a stock market P/E ratio calculation, and apply those same calculations to the Bitcoin and crypto network. To be fair, it did predict the Dot com bubble and the housing crash. But those were part of the stock market, not it's own network. Also his calculations need the previous 10 years of historical data in order to calculate the P/E. Bitcoin has only be around for 9 years. 
I can see why he says what he says in the article. He's another economist that's heard of BTC, and gotten a taste for it but he really doesn't know what he's looking at. Thus He's trying to adapt his classic P/E model to this new crypto thing and it's giving him the run around. That's why he's throwing out the usual "it will go down eventually, but maybe not right now" or "it's the tulip mania".

Dude, you need to stop having a negative view on the world at large here.
We've gone off the rails here for a sec. Lots of complicated and tricky words to look through make it seem like there's lots of stuff going on, but really it can be simple. Looking through your posts I found out what an anti-natalist is and I can see your perspective on the topic.
I got you that there's lots of garbage out there in the world. Greed being a party of that system doesn't really add anything positive. Yet, it exists. It prospers. It happens whether we want it to or not. Bitcoin's adoption first happens with greed because of price, then if folks want to learn more about it, then yay! 
On the end there, I think human's are worth saving man. There might be some hot garbage out there, but there's a whole whirlwind of good things out there too. Most of the good is just hidden behind negative news and comments.  Just ask your self why are *you* here in r/Bitcoin? I want to guess that it's for a good reason, but perhaps maybe not.. only you can know.

I think Bitcoin's a lot of things and not just only a technology it's a platform that has multiple features you can build applications on. 
It's like comparing a phone in the 1980's to a phone today. People still talk on the phone, but now your phone can also send text and emails, take photos, browse the web, etc.. 
Tech does becomes obsolete especially with computers and phones. Yet if we think about things that are on a larger scale this is less so. People still drive around 10 year old cars and fly on 10 year old airplanes. 
I think if Bitcoin were to go obsolete, it would have done it a long time ago. But since there is so much skin in the game now with exchanges and banks now jumping in, I think it's here to stay and grow.

Yes it does. Let's say that on table in front of you there's 1k USD. I say that it's yours. No catches, no scams, no tricks.. it's yours. Do you take it? 
Now, you're probably thinking of some clever 'no' answer like, oh, I really don't need it, I have plenty of money. Well, then how did you get that other plenty of money in your life and why did you do it? Maybe you take it because you want to give it to someone else or to a charity. Great! That's still greed because you're taking it anyways in order to give it to a good cause that 'you' believe in. Even if you walk away from the table and don't take the money for whatever reason, you're still saying that you don't need it because there's something else in your life in worth walking away from 1k. Think of something that's valuable in your life, then ask yourself do you want more of it. That answer is yes. 
I'm making a comparison between greed and our lizard monkey brains. Life simply wants to have food, reproduce, and be safe.... at minimum. Money in our world provides for those three qualities. Having more of money means more food, more reproduction, and more safety. 
Thus, ya. Any reasonable person would take the money because we're all a little bit greedy. Greed works because we simply want more.

I think hindsight provides clarity. Fact is, we really don't know what's going to be around in the future. But I doubt bitcoin's going to fail. Fact is greed fuels adoption. Putting a number on the price of bitcoin does this. It's why I got into it and probably you too. 
The thing is we can't really use examples to compare bitcoin directly to how technology becomes obsolete because Bitcoin is only 'part' technology. It is also part monetary value. It is also part network. It is also part trading platform. It's also dgaf about who's in control. It's also part code and protocall. It's also part smart contract and an immutable archival system. And there's probably more things that bitcoin is, that's why it's so difficult to explain what it is to folks who are not invested in the space. 
We ain't see this kind of muti-use case for money at all.. ever. We'll just have to wait and see what's going to happen next.

Here's the way I see it. Bitcoin has a lot of smart and passionate people who are working on the back-end technology all the time. Bcash does not. I also don't like how the Bcash guy acts when he's being interviewed. It is unprofessional. I don't want to invest in a crypto where that kind of attitude is brought to the development table. 
I bought bitcoin to make a return on my investment. But after I did some research and found out what bitcoin stood for and how it can actually help create a decentralized financial system to everyone in the world, i'm here to stay. 
edit* lol, was typing this up, then couldn't comment on it cuz of the lock.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:20:35
I think it's because once you increase the block-size, you have to increase the computing power in order to confirm it. Therefor, only people with serious cash and investment can mine with any sort of profit, eliminating the mom and pop mining operations. It would be reducing the amount of miners, hence making it more centralized. Then there's also the issue of transferring that bigger block size to the entire network. Which takes more time and network resources to distribute and check. 
So increasing the block size would basically kick out lots of people who are currently playing the game. 
There's also another thing that's something like, if bitcoin were to handle as many transactions as Visa, the block size would have to be like 1gig, or something like that. So, simply increasing the block size, won't solve the bigger issues. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 01:03:07
I think the players in the market will always try to play it to their own advantage to make money. Some people want someone else to take care of their money. Most folks here know better. But at the end of the day, the ETF's gonna happen. Markets are trying to adapt their  systems on to Bitcoin and there will be some success. People are going to leave their coins on exchanges, folks are going to want other people to take care of their money. 
But I see Bitcoin being mass adopted with 3rd parties controlling most people's coins. Then you'll have a mass Exodus at some point because folks will learn that you can buy Bitcoin and not just some underlying fund. You'll have a couple of next gen mount gox's that will motivate folks to get their cons stored privately and in control. But it's not gonna happy all at once. Sort of like people leaving Facebook today, the exchanges and banks will still be around, but the folks who move their coins to their own private wallet will only increase.

Fun idea, but would never sell. The real idea of Satoshi  being "missing" or "disappeared" is much more compelling as a story. Not knowing what actually happened to him or the wallet is an irl driving force for Bitcoin today. Plus, there's not enough people who know about Satoshi in order to generate that kind of buzz. Think about some one who's never heard or know of Bitcoin or Shatoshi N. Why does someone like that care about who this person is or what they have done. 
You could probably make a compelling story about the people who want to try and find or hack SN's wallet. And there's already a movie on Netflix called the Bitcoin heist. Like I said It's a fun idea, but probably couldn't get any legs to run on.

Computers eventually get faster while using less energy. Newer hardware would have higher hash rates while consuming less power. 
Also, miners would seek out the cheapest  energy source to maximize profits. Since renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper compared to fossel fuels, miners would most likely seek out those renewables.

I have and EVGA SC 1080ti using nichhash. No temp or clock adjustments and get between 3-4$usd a day paid in bitcoin. It runs around 70c, 58-60C if I run fan software. I also turn off mining when I'm at home in the evening either playing games or watching netflix. It's been fine for me. I probably break even with the monthly power bill.
The way I look at it is to play the long game. Will I ever make back the money I paid for the card? Probably not right now. But I'm betting that in a few years, bitcoin and crypto will rise in price so the coins I mine now will increase in value over time, thus paying for the card and power. I find it more of a hobby than a serious way to make money unless your power is free.

I happen to catch another video by him where he says that he doesn't invest in Bitcoin because he doesn't understand it, but he'll take it if someone gives it to him. 
The principle of the video is to say yes to the customer. In this case the customer wanted to pay in Bitcoin. He then goes to say that they need to learn and figure it out how to work with the customer and accept Bitcoin.
Whether or not he's really bullish or not here is unclear in the video. But, he's willing to adapt his business to accept bitcoin as any good business man would do to service their clients.

In a way, no currency is ever stable. It's a question of whether a currency is stable enough.
We also have to separate both real value and assigned value. Nobody really knows what the real value of a thing is, so we let people decide how much a thing is worth in the free market. 
You could measure the world's wealth in Bitcoin just as you can measure the world's wealth in dollars, or in RMB, or in Pounds, or in Euros, or in Boliviars. With bitcoin, yes, you keep dividing bitcoins the wealth or the world equals to total cap of 21 million.

This is neat. I'd also make the comparison a table. Like how popular benchmark tests visually format their sites: 
For a fraction of a second, I saw bitcoin, then I though "wouldn't it be nice to see the apple.. oh there it is." 
I suppose that if it's a direct comparison, where you see the numbers on a table, I feel the information would be conveyed more quickly, clearly, and directly. 
I'd also put some of the most common stocks on there that everyone would know Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, JP Morgan, gold, as if when someone comes directly to the site, the information could just pop up, like (gold vs bitcoin) or have one button click comparisons so folks can just one click instead of trying to remember the stock ticker badge. 
All in all, I think it's cool. Great work!

There are no additional bitcoins created. Just the current bitcoins in circulation increase in value. We have to use two separate value system for both the house and bitcoins.
Lets say from your example we buy our house for B10. If the value of the house stays exactly same and all Bitcoins increase 100% in value, your house would be worth B5. Because only a fixed amount of bitcoin are created, each coin increases in value and thus can buy more. 
Now let's say that we buy our house for B10. The value of your house in 5 years increases 100% and all Bitcoins increase 100% in value, your house now be worth B10. 
While the amount of bitcoins remain the same, the amount of stuff you can purchase with Bitcoin increases. In other words, the wealth of your house can gain value because Bitcoin gains value even tho the amount of bitcoin remains the same. [Just like this classic.](
So there's no additional bitcoins created, value is simply added to the current coins in circulation. 
Wealth can never exceed bitcoin you just need to assign a value to it. If the whole bitcoin network was 21million dollars, then 1 bitcoin would be worth $1. If the whole network was worth 21 billion dollars, then 1 bitcoin would be worth $1,000. If the whole network was worth 21 Trillion dollars, then 1 bitcoin would be worth $1,000,000 dollars. So yes, we would keep dividing bitcoins in order to satisfy the world's wealth.

Move them to your own hardware wallet as other suggested. However, if you don't want to pay fees, you can do this. It's what I do.

I think the CCP isn't stupid about bitcoin. They know not your keys, not your coins. But what they can do is ~~use~~ tell their people to acquire bitcoin through their own exchange. Then say they they can only purchase it/store it on that exchange, or else... Then at some point in the future, just close the exchange and take all their bitcoin.

I have a Nano-S and just recently purchased a Ledger blue. Something others have not mentioned is that if you want to send bitcoins to any address with your hardware wallet, you have to physically push the buttons on the device to confirm a transaction. 
Even if someone were to have total control and access to your computer, your hardware wallet connected, their BTC address, and they click the send button, they still cannot get your bitcoins because you have to confirm the transaction on the device irl.

I don't talk about it unless someone asks me about finance stuff or the conversation is about budget. Then I kinda always make a joke about Bitcoin. It breaks the ice. If they show more interest in Bitcoin, i'll dive deeper, if not, I just brush it off as a "we'll see what happens with it!" Response.

Hey all, correct me if i'm missing something here: 
So there's lots of talk about 'missing or lost' coins on the Bitcoin network. Technically these coins are not lost, but the keys to access them are? 
If that's the case how can we know how many coins are truly in accessable?
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:34:03
This was a good and balanced trailer.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:24:06
Make sure you do a test transfer first so you can see if you transferred your bitcoins correctly. It'll prevent you from losing everything in case you made a mistake along the way.
You can withdraw your coins from Coinbase pro to avoid transfer fees. When you signed up for a Coinbase account, you automatically get a coinbase pro account since they're the same company. 
From your Coinbase Pro account, deposit your BTC from Coinbase. Sometimes it's not availble to deposit and you'll have to wait a few days. It's normal. Once your BTC is in your Coinbase pro account, select withdraw 'to address' and enter the receiving address from your ledger live app.

Hey, don't beat yourself up. I get you, I've made mistakes back in my day too. Lost it all on a business with a former friend which at the time, we had no clue what market we were diving into or what we were doing. I fell back onto my college degree and some trade skills to pull myself back up. Sure, it took time, but I learned to be more careful in what decisions I make and now I'm not doing too bad. One step at a time, day by day. I know it seems like everything's coming down on you now, but take it from me you're gonna be all right. :)

I think banks will still be around, but they'll have to offer services that benefits customers first rather than themselves. 
If everything is transacted in BTC, then lets say you take out a loan for 10BTC and the Bank charges you 0.1BTC for the loan. You would have to pay back 10.1BTC to the bank regardless of the increase in value. 
I can imaging a world where loans are taken out with deflationary crypto alt coins, and loans paid back with BTC because of it's continued increase in value.

Hey there, great work! I work in entertainment and closely with folks who are in the advertising space. After just glancing at your posters, here are some thoughts and first impressions.
The decentralized should be broken up by DE - CEN - TRA - LIZED. Basically splitting up the  syllable of the word makes it easier to read. If there's another meaning with the way you have the word split up, I'm missing it, and would probably thing other folk who aren't part of the Bitcoin community would miss it too. 
The pizza character's are odd. I would have chosen fiat money characters such as the dollar and the euro. Bitcoin would lead the way to a new currency and the Fiat money would follow.
The little rocket guy in the too the moon, a suggestion would be to have him riding up on the rocket ( like you have the rollercoaster) then have him riding down toward the moon.
Anyways, those are the things I noticed. They look good regardless of these suggestions. Glad your helping spread the word. Cheers!

Being part of for years, I've learned that it's more about managing and gaining control of your budget rather than investing. If investment topics come up, usually they're all recommending safe bets. Investing in index funds and turning folks away from known bad investments such as whole life insurance, or hiring a financial adviser. 
I know because I was in that boat a few years ago. helped me fire the people who were taking my money and helped me regain control. I learned that you're the only person who's going to care about your money, everyone else is trying to take it away. Folks on share some of the same ideas as r/pf such as Hodl or don't invest what you can't afford to loose. 
Reading, learning, and finding out what BTC is all about is interesting enough for me to put a lot of funds into BTC to see what happens. Joining the Bitcoin movement would have never happened had it not been for getting my personal finances in order. I have to thank for that.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:11:07
I think once the price of BTC becomes stable in the future, we'll then see it be used more as a currency rather than an investment/trading/store of value vehicle.

Same here. I've also heard that they've switch the memory fab process from GDDR5 to GDDR6 for the next gen Graphics Cards that are suppose to come out this year. That could cause less focus on GDDR5 products while ramping up production on GDDR6 cards.

The first line of defense is don't tell anyone that you have Bitcoin. 
The only people who've been robbed are the people who flaunt their coins on social media and say 'look how much I have!" It only makes you a target. It's like the stupid criminals who video record themselves committing a crime and uploading the video to their facebook page. You're going to regret it. 
Don't chance it. Don't talk about how much you have. Taking additional precautions is good. But if no one knows you own bitcoin then no one is seeking out to rob you. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:35:02
It's saying that Bitcoin is 'scary' and 'bad' and 'used by drug dealers and criminals', you shouldn't use it either! It keeps people from getting the least bit interested as well as putting on the brakes for folks who may be on the fence about discovering what bitcoin really is. It can also scare folks so much that they just stay away from it or worse, tell their friends and co-workers that it's a scam.

I know it seems like the world is falling in on you and everything is hopeless. But it will get better, it truly does get better. Think of this as a learning experience. Getting scammed happens to everyone no matter who they are. The thing you can do is learn from it and train yourself not get scammed again. 
Don't beat yourself up to much. Everything's gonna be ok. Just hang in there and keep working hard my friend.

I bought one new and just sold it on Ebay about a week ago Maybe you were the one that bought it? lol. 
Had no problems with it. As far as I know, ledger still supports it. I kinda made the purchase back in the day because it was the new thing. For me, I wasn't using it for what it was meant to be used for and I still don't know what it's meant to be used for. The touch screen is nice and you can check your transactions quicker with it. 
In other words, it's really just fine. I'm just a regular user so I don't know the difference on the tech between wallets. I was able to restore it and access my coins just like any other hardware wallet. At some point I decided to switch to a nano S just for the smaller footprint and since everything is done on the ledger live app, a Nano S is just right for me so I switched to one of those.
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:18:06
It didn't say much to people like us who are already well versed in Bitcoin. But for those who haven't heard of it or don't understand what it is, the piece was good in the sense of exposure to the layman.

You know what was interesting was that there was an article a few years back where coinbase ran out of bitcoin to sell. Literally, they couldn't send bitcoins to private wallets. 
I think that wall street isn't dumb. They're buying up real bitcoins and will try to develop their bitcoins papers. But when people who own bitcoin papers try to withdraw actual bitcoin to their own wallets and there won't be enough. I image at that point the banks can't give the people money even though they want to which will release all hell on the whole system. While at the same time bitcoin skyrockets in value because nobody can get them. 
But who knows what will happen really, looks like we gotta keep sayin Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:54:35
What's interesting is they say if wall street offerings products with sudo created bitcoins, the real bitcoin network can just hard fork away and those financial instruments they created would be worthless. The only folks who'd win are the ones who control their own private keys. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:32:31
So lets say adoption takes off and most people have their coins located on exchanges, in funds, held by banks and institutions. 
Could their be laws passed against users holding their own private keys or a law passed where only regulated financial institutions could hold private keys, thus preventing actual Bitcoin being withdraws from banks or institutions? 
For instance, couldn't Coin Base just not give you access to withdraw your bitcoins to a private wallet? I'm curious on your thoughts...
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:22:46
Was trying to figure that out too. But from the looks of it, the rest of the market is currently 5680 while that chart's trading btc at 6086, a $400 premium over the average market price. Most likely to get people to transfer their coins over there to sell at a profit? I dunno. Anyone else want to chime in?

Coinbase will charge you a fee to send, however, you can avoid the fees this way: When you sign up for a coinbase account, you automatically get a coinbase pro account. It's their trading platform. Don't let all the bells and whistles scare you. You can transfer your coins to the coinbase pro account, then withdraw them from there with no fees. There's only like two more steps you take. Here's a guide.

Computers do all the trading now anyway. I can see an AI system be built in order to make money. Sure. 
[This was a great video to watch]( end to end. It talks about how AI's being used to help people be more creative in the industry. 
I think for the coming AI revolution in any industry, you gotta find a niche that is in the decision making part of the industry. Anything that's a repeated task is going to get eliminated. Tesla is a good example of this where they try to automate anything they can, but found out that human hands are better and doing some custom work better that robots.
