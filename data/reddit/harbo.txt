Just because it's less fringe now doesn't mean it still isn't fringe, and by saying that it's a speculative asset you're essentially proving Frankeh's point.

That's ok and indeed desirable - but only if no one else is hurt if they fail. Do you think it would be ok for two guys to work on poisonous chemicals in their garage, with a danger that they leak?

Kind of? You think 17k is "kind of" expensive for an online degree from a terrible university?

Again, it's an online degree from a shit university. At that price you can get a year at Harvard.

The obvious analogy is that website that tried to be a place for trading Magic: the Gathering cards but failed.

You don't have to prove it. It's the regulators job to prove that you're not compliant.

And the whole fucking point is that once certain individuals have large enough positions (as is the case) that no longer holds.

Yet a coin having any value is dependent on trusting that a person holding large numbers of them will not sell them at a cheap price in a short interval.

So nothing should be done now?

Some number of people still would have lost their money, so yes, yes it would have been a problem.


And that's exactly what this is for. Also, you don't get to choose what's a "small" startup and what's not. If you have the potential to fuck up other people with your business you need to be regulated.

No. No it won't.

But only because the Congress has ceded that authority to them and they definitely have not given the Fed any authority regarding bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:14:26
So by that logic we shouldn't have regulated the banks in 2007? My head hurts.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:25:39


I think that concludes the debate then.

And like he said, if Satoshi was instead some banker or government type, you'd be commending her.

So it's ok if that chemical leak only hurts 2 people instead of 200?
