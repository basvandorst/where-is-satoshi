On top of this I recommend doing a fake recovery of the wallet to make sure you backed it up correctly. Put some change into it (few dollars) and delete/attempt to recover

Anyone able to ELI5? I’m at work so I only half read it.
Fake block produced? 8 nodes confirmed it was invalid? Followed by the price tanking. How does a fake block get produced ?

Natural gas is mostly methane... burning it turns to CO2 and water vapour. But yes methane not burnt is just under 100x (I believe between 75-85x) worse than co2 emissions. 
I’d guess this is talking about using the typically flared methane to produce power to mine crypto’s

Newton, it’s roughly 0.6% per buy/sell from the spread (no fees other then that)
Edit: just checked, the current spread is less than 0.5%
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:09:20
I say fake because there’s no real stress behind recovering a couple dollars as a test. If I dumped all my crypto into it and never tested if I could recover, then had the device die on me that’d be the real recovery with actual coins to lose.

Weirdly enough both those characters are voiced by the same person

Energy cannot be created or destroyed (1st law of thermodynamics) (only converted) if you had a small engine+generator you could technically do this but it wouldn’t be infinite, there is a lot of losses converting heat to work/power. With a typical engine + generator you’d be lucky to get 30-40% efficiency from diesel. 
You also aren’t pulling enough heat to get any power in the real world. I believe the closest engine cycle you could do on a small scale would be the “Carnot cycle” but it’s only theoretical.
Recycle it as heat if you live in the arctic like me :)

Bitcoin/crypto mining stocks exist on the tsx, I own some in my tfsa but they don’t follow the price of bitcoin as much as I’d like. Some days bitcoins up and they’re down, or bitcoins down a little and the stocks are down more.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:11:06
Isn’t hive mostly mining/holding ethereum? It’s struggled a lot with shitty relations with genesis, losing investor faith. It’s also likely at those peaks it may have been overvalued. When the next financial statements come out it may boost if it’s actually undervalued.

Where are you getting the 250 million a day? 12.5 coins every 10 minutes (rough average of each block time) that’s 18million. Many miners hold the bitcoin as well. One of the Canadian mining stocks is holding over 4000btc, basically only selling what they need to, to pay for power.
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:34:37
It wouldn’t, loads of people have purchased bitcoin using debt, see it on this subreddit sometimes

Not just inconvenient, he mentions any business accepting crypto goes out of business then the one he finds doesn’t accept it (I think it previously did) watched it a few nights ago fuzzy on the details
@_date: 2019-11-30 02:06:54
Hmm I’ll have to check out your app
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:28:14
I’d follow/try, I’d recommend making it known what time/day the next puzzle will be posted in advance

Depends where you live, big cities have the rat race going on (more workers than good jobs; employers market)
I’m mid 20’s living up in the arctic, small town that is the opposite, employees market (more jobs than workers), making 130k/yr+ (depending on OT) with full benefits, 5 weeks paid holidays (6 in around 1/2 a year from now) and the  pension plan in ���� 
With my leftover cash after expenses I can buy 0.4-0.5 btc/month (I don’t, but I could)
TLDR; don’t be a slave to some company getting rich while you struggle to do the minimum, if you want to get paid reasonably go where the work is
Also get a useful education (trades, engineering, niche programming etc)

Based on volume I don’t think bakkt is near 5% volume BTC had 23.8b $ in volume (from coin market cap). Bakkt had a little over 4000bitcoins (30m $ roughly) so based on that today they account for 0.12%.
Who knows how accurate any of this volume is though.
I’m excited to keep watching the bakkt volume as I check a few times a day, and it’s been having increasing volume (sort of expected with big price fluctuations like today)

Monero is more surprising on that list to me.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:44:00
Pfft let me know when someone survives on the moon for 24 hours with only BTC

Where is it you’re talking about? not a lot that jobs that don’t have other benefits offsetting costs here. In my territory depending where you are living you get allowances on top of your regular wage (living allowance to offset the extra costs of living) some communities this is above 30k/year. As well some communities pay for your power, utilities etc. Less than 0.3% of the country lives in the 3 territories that take up 40% of Canada’s land mass, that’s why the benefits are high here.

Anyone know how many bitcoins he could mine with those computers? Old, low spec computers in massive quantities competing against modern ASICS, curious on the return
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:10:18
You could check out newton 50k/day limit and 10k instant access if you’re buying more then 10k you need to wait for funds to clear (couple days) and you can’t withdraw until funds clear of course.

I want the pot you’re smoking if you see this
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:34:51
I had no issues, I tested with a smaller deposit, could buy instantly. After the transfer was cleared I tested a withdrawal as well as selling/depositing back into my bank and both were fast. Bitcoin Withdrawal was within seconds (even a larger withdrawal was instant)
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:32:23
His check will bounce you’ll take out and send 1.7k, losing 1.7k.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:29:55
Newton let’s you buy 50k a day and you can request higher
Edit:  also r/BitcoinCA for a Canadian bitcoin reddit
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:02:06
You could try newton

What app is that?

So I can soon buy bitcoin in a TFSA? Mind you I won’t be in control of the bitcoin?

Anyone taking bitcoin seriously doesn’t look at a 15 minute chart seriously or stress over daily price swings.

I’ve been using “newton” very quick and easy, links to your Bank for adding funds or cashing out
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:58:01
Mines linked to my bank, I just use the bank transfer option (no fees) they give you instant access to up to 10k but it takes a few days before the money actually goes through so you can’t withdraw until then. Once the money is confirmed all my withdrawals were instant
Edit: no idea on e-transfer I never checked
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:26:35
What do you do if you need to send money to a exchange that doesn’t support it (like bitstamp)? Assuming all your funds are bc1, and what happens if I send money to them from a bc1 address?
I tried to send funds from a exchange to a bc1 wallet and it came up with a error. Not sure what would happen if I sent them funds from a bc1 wallet?
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:39:02
Check out newton exchange I’ve had a awesome experience buying from them (Canadian)

A test transaction could be a few sats, personally I always send a few bucks as a test (consider it money you wouldn’t care about if it somehow got lost. that’s the whole reason you’re doing the test)
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:29:43
Some good ol’ lsd? Needing bitcoin to buy weed sounds funny as a Canadian, my boss (engineering office) was showing me pictures of his parents pot plants yesterday at work.
Anyway, depending where you live maybe a bitcoin atm? Usually big fees upwards of 10-20% (I’ve never actually used) another option would be localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:53:28
I do that everytime, when sending significant amounts of money you can’t double check the numbers enough, I also read every letter both on the test send and real send even though they should be the same for both. For smaller sends I just read the first couple and last couple (this would likely be good enough for large sends too, but extra quality assurance won’t hurt)
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:20:07
How many bitcoins per contract?
