Protocol is broken. LN is not a scaling solution. It is an attempt to collect fees.

Miners are incentivized by fees. As bitcoin marches forward, block reward diminishes and fee volumes rise. Eventually there will be no block rewards and mining incentives will 100% be transaction fees. Let’s be clear that fees themselves will not get more expensive so long as block size is large enough to virtually guarantee transactions go into the next block. It’s the fee *volume* that rises along with adoption. Miners are incentivized by volume of fees rising. 
Core ruined cheap fees with small blocks and RBF. Cash does not need RBF. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:36:32
And how did BCH handle it? Transactions still went into the next block. It appeared to non-existent to those actually using the network.  These so-called attacks are extremely expensive and fruitless. I don’t see an issue.

Roger Ver does not own Bitcoin Cash. He did not create it, he did not start it. He does however, support it because he feels it is closer to the original Bitcoin that Satoshi created. It's not a Ponzi, unless you think the original Bitcoin without Segwit was a Ponzi. It was not.

It would be better to compare to gold, as any fiat currency may completely crash in the future. If USD crashes, what does a $1M bitcoin even mean? We'd be better off using gold.
1 troy oz gold = 5.17 BTC
In the future this may change to many, many oz of gold = 1 BTC and it will hold meaning regardless of what fiat does.

You can't put the cart before the horse. When Bitcoin becomes an every day staple these terms and definitions will reveal themselves on their own.
This is like yelling at someone what a "social network" is in 1998, before people grasped the idea of social networking. Back then any website where users interacted was pigeon holed as a dating website.

Wrong, the devs have no direct control. The devs could technically fork the code but the majority of miners would also have to adapt the fork. Since this has no good outcome (undermine the entire point of what bitcoin stands for) no one, including devs, would be interested in doing this.

@_date: 2014-12-15 03:45:29
I have no doubt the price could get there. There will come a major critical cross-over point: The demand for bitcoin will continue to rise, and the supply of bitcoin will continue to diminish. The halving will be a telling story, and the next halving after that in 2021. Another thing to think of, how bitcoin will affect the US Dollar. It may very well be that pricing bitcoin in USD will not make sense any more. A more viable comparison will the value of bitcoin to gold.

A lot of that type if thinking is also driven by spite. Someone new to Bitcoin, not fully understanding the underpinnings, seeing all these early adopters that stand to make gains (from their own risks), it is a common reaction to think they are in just for the gamble. Completely false for those that get it. We are here because we saw its potential, got involved, and continue to witness it write history.

Started mining in 2011 when the first $33 bubble happened. The difficulty rose so fast that my 400mh miner was only cranking out about 1 coin per day. Then windows updated (and broke) my graphics card driver. I was too lazy to fix it so the machine sat for a solid 6 months. Then I got it rolling again, had upwards of 150 coins, used about 60 of them to buy a butterfly labs box. It didn't ship for 6 months or so. So far I've mined about 4 of those back. :(

I know anonymity is a feature of Bitcoin, but would it not be beneficial for business types to "register" their bitcoin wallet address with either a website address and/or email address? That way when you scan the QR code you can see some form of validity on your wallet software. It would be a simple thing to supply a service like this, then give wallets an API to grab registrant info from. However I do see some drawbacks with this approach: 1) businesses may use a new wallet address with every transaction, rendering this useless, and b) this creates a single-point-of attack if this service really caught on and all businesses relied on it as a form of validation.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:49:07
Why do people assume this would instigate a huge price drop? It's not like they are getting dumped onto an exchange, creating a paywall to climb. It is not eating into Bitcoin purchases that would have otherwise been made. It will be a private sale. Nothing really changes, it is just a passing news headline.

This was discussed in another thread recently, but the term "trustlessness" is probably not the best term to convey Bitcoin, as "trustlessness" may carry a feeling of distrust and doubt. "Provable, decentralized trust" is a better, more accurate term. Bitcoin trusts in the math, the blockchain, not the whim of a central authority.
@_date: 2014-09-22 01:58:50
Still too technical for most. I'd say the bitcoins are tracked on a ledger (like a spreadsheet) that is kept in check by the entire bitcoin network. It really doesn't need to go beyond that, unless they ask more specific questions.
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:24:11
The price responds to the market. Supply and demand. Spending Bitcoins is probably the best thing you can do for the market. Accepting Bitcoin as a merchant is another. When the demand outweighs the supply, the price goes up. Since Bitcoin has a built-in mining rate and overall limit of 21M, the price has nowhere to go but up. Whether or not it is going up NOW is irrelevant. It will, over time, go up.
@_date: 2014-01-21 15:43:56
And what happens when these floodgates open? The supply does not change... so the price sky rocket? What happens when technical difficulties plug up the buy orders? crash? :/

This. Before Bitcoin I knew that fiat currencies were in trouble, but didn't really have much knowledge about it. The mere existence of Bitcoin has "outted" knowledge of our current financial problems front and center to many thousands of smart young folks.

When the time comes for the current economy to collapse, (not IF but WHEN), we will hopefully have a viable option to turn to.

It is called Bitcoin, and we spend them in bits. It's mostly phycology. Using micro/millijust isn't simple enough. No one uses that for currency. Bits are also 2 decimals, what we expect for currency. Bits don't have to make sense metrically, context is what really matters. Bitcoins and bits. 1 = 1 million. That is all you need to know.

@_date: 2014-11-10 03:48:50

It would be more accurate to say BTC would be worth ~7500x what it is worth today. If the earth adopted Bitcoin as a single unified currency, the purchase power of a US dollar would be near zero and therefore meaningless to compare Bitcoin to.

You have to get BTC out of your head. It doesn't matter, and it should fade into history. Think of Bitcoin as the name of the currency, and a "bit" as a denomination, similar to "dollar" in US dollars. A dollar is 100 cents. A bit is 100 satoshis.  We need to stop thinking in divisions of BTC and instead think in multiples of satoshis. It is only confusing when you try to relate it to BTC.

A temporary catch 22. Ultimately you don't want to exchange currencies and just do bitcoin-&gt;merchant. Like someone else said, getting paid in Bitcoin would be part of the solution. Also, you can accept Bitcoin for goods and services as a merchant. Also if you use a bank transfer instead of debit/credit on circle, there is no txn fee.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:07:03
So with that logic, we shouldn't use Bitcoin to buy anything as there is no consumer protection. Thanks Einstein. This is a case of fraud on the merchant end, not consumer "idiots" using Bitcoin for what it was meant to be used for.

There would not be two *persistent* chains. If a fork occurs, a changing of the guard begins, along with abrupt incentive for miners to quickly switch to one side of the chain. Any miners staying on the less-popular chain would miss out on blocks, and switch. Before you know it, the original side of the fork is defunct.

And when they cash out, the BTC is again in the wild, circulating for everyone to use. So what? You have to see the forest beyond the trees, Bitcoin today is not Bitcoin tomorrow.

It will never work! --AA

In January 2013, $1000 per BTC sounded like a fairy tale. And now, $10k is the same scenario. I'm in the same boat as you. If Bitcoin goes anywhere near what its potential is, 10k is not a tough target to hit in 2014. I hope we get there early, that just means Bitcoin mass adoption is imminent.

It's a vicious cycle. Most anyone I talk to, even the most astute, mindful people that could go read about Bitcoin and understand its implications on the future of money, all choose the same route: they want to wait until the price falls again before getting any, then when the price eventually moves up significantly, they just assume they missed the boat.

I don't think hoarders are affecting "becoming a currency". There will always be savers and users, and the number of those that use it will go up as more come on board with it. The more that come on board, the more adoption it will get, and so on. Hoarders are no different than people with savings accounts in USD. And it's not a dogshit analogy, it is an accurate analogy in the context of "bitcoin will never become a currency" aspect because it doesn't work right now, in the environment we have today, which is a dogshit assumption.
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:36:27
What is meant by "nothing happen", do you get a web page? Does the javascript console show anything? PHP error log? Did you setup the database tables?

Yes, servers need to implement and support the protocol to be useful. I'm starting with a Wordpress plugin to make the server-side a 1-click install, then anyone can use 1Block to sign into a wordpress instance. I will also be putting out more server-side code examples, there is a PHP one out there now. If you lose your phone and don't have the phrase, you can't log in. You have to either locate the phrase, copy the ID from another device, or contact the server end and have them reset the ID. It is important to keep the phrase protected, like a SSN.
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:28:46
No passwords to remember, one ID for everything, 256 bit ECC security, brain dead to use for the end user, no phishing to worry about, no PII or sensitive data over the wire. To name a few.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:16:49
I believe the BitId implementation I saw supported multiple Ids, but for a specific ID it would send the same public key to all servers. 1Block generates a unique keypair per server behind the scenes. It also has revoking built in.

This is where we differ. Core stepped in and took control of the bitcoin ecosystem. Several devs defected as they were not in line with the objectives that core observes. So in a sense, core is the hijacker, and BU is trying to take back what consensus wants.

@_date: 2016-01-06 14:35:29
I know about both. BitID did not support separate key generation per site, nor key revoking. SQRL does not use any Blockchain ECC. 1Block, using Blockchain ECC, is written entirely in javascript, so the development platform is exposed to a wide range of developers. I also have a client ready to go in the app stores. All that is needed is server implementations. 1Block is just another option in the new world of passwordless logins.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:43:53

One benefit is leveraging the tools available in the Blockchain ecosystem. Full implementation can be done in javascript libraries. Also the benefit of 256 bit ECC, which is somewhere in the equivalence of 3000 bits of RSA.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:30:18
The IDs generated are Bitcoin addresses, although they never touch the actual Bitcoin network, or used for Bitcoin transactions. They use the Blockchain ECC to sign messages. The 1Block code is 100% javascript libraries, all available via the Blockchain ecosystem, making the system reachable to a wide range of developers.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:15:03
BU blocks are BTC. It is not an alt. If it becomes the longest chain, it will be Bitcoin. Core screwed up by not increasing the block size. They need small blocks for their agenda, thus covering up with overly complex solutions like segwit. All we need is larger blocks to fix the backlog. Then we can worry about other things. BU offers the least invasive approach. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:45:15
Is 10 years any better?
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:33:30
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:05:50
Or miner activated hard fork, increase block size to 2MB now to handle the backlog problem, then deal with other issues after (such as malleability, what segwit addresses in the first place, not scaling.)
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:43:01
I have seen ideas like this. My issue is "database server they trust". A s soon as you enter a "trusted" party, all bets are off. If the trust was in a decentralized manner, that could be different. 1Block uses no third parties or central trust. The authentication is simply a verification that the user returning is indeed the same user, with no burden of passwords to remember or reset.

@_date: 2016-01-06 21:08:50
Right. 1Block (for all intents and purposes) guarantees the returning user is indeed the same one that set the original (trusted) ID. Passwords have numerous vulnerabilities that 1Block addresses.

To limit the blocksize and move transactions off the chain so they can be controlled and regulated. That's a *great* idea, in the spirit of Bitcoin! *facepalm* This is why BU is gaining control. No worries, core will be but a distant memory soon enough.

Lest we forget if BU indeed does fork, there will be MANY more eyeballs on the code. The more the better. Every bug fix is a step toward resilience, and always a lesson learned. We can learn from the bigger bugs and how to avoid them in the future. Did we forget Bitcoin has had bugs/issues before?

Lest we forget the core virus, which BU is here to eradicate.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:37:58
This is largely due to the politics directly and quickly attacking the issue, and lets not forget the direct attack of bringing the nodes down in the first place. You know that came directly from core, who else would care.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:14:27

@_date: 2017-08-17 00:24:10
Show me this proof and science? Just saying it doesn't make it so. Bitcoin was originally designed to scale with large blocks. Bitcoin cash is not having any technical troubles. It's actually cheap and fast, something Bitcoin Core hasn't had in a log while.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:24:41
At first glance, Clef costs. 1Block is free and open source. Clef uses RSA, 1Block uses ECC. Clef touts itself as 2FA. 1Block can be 2FA or your standard login. 1Block is 100% built in javascript tools, making it flexible and reachable to a wide range of developers.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:45:39
There are only a handful people with commit access to the Core github repo. All surrounded by a few decision makers. It needs to be many software distributions, all working mostly in compatibility with each other. One has a bug, it doesn't take down the whole network. One has a feature the market likes, it can be quickly adopted. Not controlled by a few people paid by one company.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:44:27
There are no lies about who controls the software. NYA voted for 2x, not Core. The market is desperate for a way forward, and with limited options this was result. We can only wait and see what happens. The next few months will be interesting.
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:40:44
So you think the loss of value over time is a good thing? The average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years. The US Dollar is long overdue, an it will to, in time, meet its hyperinflation demise. When it does it will likely be overnight. It tried in 2008, and it was bailed out with the printing for trillions of dollars to banks. They have learned nothing. There won't be a bailout next time, and it will be much worse, you can count on that.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:29:27
It's too soon, there is not enough liquidity in Bitcoin to keep the volatility low. It will eventually stabilize when its market value is met. I think we are a long ways from that. The businesses accepting Bitcoin today are the pioneers, the risk takers believing in a greater good. Although the US dollar is not as volatile, It is slowly losing value. Over 98% in 45 years! That is "ok"?

That litmus test is only for the status quo. Bitcoin is very different from government issued currency. In the US I can only pay my taxes in US dollars by law. That does not make a definition of currency, it only labels what currency a government accepts. 
A better test is, can you buy/sell goods with it across dispersed markets?
So yes Bitcoin is a currency. Maybe not a globally known/accepted one, but that changes with time.

A fork is not an attack, it's merely another choice. A choice for minors, exchanges, users. If you don't like how one is working, you can move to another. It is totally possible for one to overcome another. That is how Bitcoin was designed to work.

I think 1/1M was chosen so that bits are represented as two decimal places. 1 bit = 100 satoshi. 2 decimal format fits the status quo, so works well with existing money representation. And , 1 USD = 3 bits may be a reality in the future anyways as the value rises.

Oh my god can you even hear yourself? Most of the above is not fact, it is what you want to believe. We can only wait. If BU becomes the main chain, that means they do have the support of the community, unlike you your biased assumptions. And no, I'm not paid. I'm a miner from 2011 and a HODLer. My interest lies with the greater good for Bitcoin. I believe in what it stands (stood) for. That may not be BU or Core in the long run. But given the current status quo, core is not the answer. That is my opinion, and obviously not yours. FWIW, I hope Bitcoin survives and becomes a frictionless global currency.

A global trustless ledger is only as good as the network power backing it. Right now, even in its infancy, the blockchain network power is staggering. For a copycat to hold a candle they are going to need network power that approaches or overtakes the blockchain. For that to happen, it would have to be a better blockchain. Something the current blockchain cannot overcome itself.

So by your definition, if BU forks and gains the majority mining power and for all intents and purposes becomes Bitcoin, then the BS codebase (segwit) becomes an alt coin.

BU is not an alt coin. Same chain. Longest wins.

@_date: 2017-04-02 14:26:01
It is all based on the same chain. Same genesis block. An alt is a separate chain altogether. BU holds the same rules as Bitcoin always had before BS. And what you call a valid chain IS the longest one. Once a fork occurs, one chain will dominate quickly.

What are you talking about, rounding off BTC to 4 decimals? Bits has nothing to do with that. It just means instead of thinking in BTC, you think in bits. This item costs 4020 bits.

If a rising price is all that concerns someone, then maybe getting into bitcoin is not for them. It is too volatile right now, very risky. It is not up to you to educate them and keep them interested, they have to want to do that. Otherwise a lot of blame may land squarely on your shoulders because gains were not realized in a specific timeframe.
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. It may be that the price will drop below $100 again and shake out many, many players. If you want to get into Bitcoin, you have to look to the horizon and believe the system will eventually be successful, which may take years.

Once the next big app happened (the web) it slowly became recognized that the internet was more than mail.

That is not entirely correct either, all lockers with contents are easily discovered on the blockchain. A better analogy would be that there is a nearly infinite pile of keys with a nearly infinite row of corresponding lockers. Anyone can pick up any key and see what locker it belongs to. The probability of finding a key that fits a locker with contents is so improbable, it makes the security of the lockers quite strong. If someone wants a locker, they can make an instant copy of any key and use the locker it corresponds to. I say copy because all possible keys are always available to everyone. There is no way to find the key to a locker (except by chance, good luck), but it is easy to find the locker for a specific key.

We are in early adopter phase. It doesn't do much good to convince the average Joe to use it now, it is WAY to early. Once the infrastructure starts taking hold to make Bitcoin seamless and secure, the masses will follow. That infrastructure is being built every day. If you are going to adopt Bitcoin today, it is because you have a genuine interest in it and you are willing to put forth the effort. Most people are not interested. I expect an "AOL of Bitcoin" will spring up and bring mass adoption.

I don't think it's the same. At a gambling table you assume you will cash out at some point. With Bitcoin a buyer may never have to exchange back again. So saying he lost it all until he exchanges back is moot. He holds what he invested, that's it. And he's likely not gambling his Bitcoin, they are just held or spent.

Depends on your point of view I suppose. You said it yourself: some are greedy for more, sensitive for dip. IMHO, bad idea. If you are in this to make a quick buck, you deserve to lose when you panic sell. Bitcoin is short-term volatile and risky, but the long-term trend is UP. Those that invest and ignore short-term gains and losses will be just fine. Trying to guess the short-term game, good luck.

And did no one violate the HK agreement? This isn't about honesty. Miners are in it for profits. The market will follow low fees, frictionless transactions, and high value. ie. a useful currency. The software devs (many groups) will be working on, well, software, and the miners have incentive to implement the software that accomplishes the above the best.

Guessing a private key is infinitesimally unlikely for a truly random key. For all intents and purposes, it will never happen. The real concern is private keys made from random numbers chosen by computers. That is, how much entropy is really enough? IMHO completely rule it out and stick to generating keys from dice rolls or card shuffles.

I'm fine with off-chain scaling solutions. We already have it to some degree. But let's not make it mandatory. On-chain scaling needs to happen too. It seems such a simple thing, to lift the artificial limit once placed to control spam. But we can't seem to agree on that :/

Great reply. In the general thread discussions I am seeing no consensus, so let's figure one out :) Please list your ideal denominations so we can all discuss them.
A "bit" is often thought of as the smallest piece. A "bitcent" made sense for the satoshi, as the cent is the smallest denomination in many existing currencies. So I started there and worked my way up in value.

We need to start thinking of Bitcoin as mBTC, or millibits, or 1000th of a Bitcoin. The $1000 milestone for BTC is probably a great place to start. Let's start talking mBTC as it comes up to the $1 mark!

I would explain the locks instead as lock boxes with a coin slot. Anyone can deposit coins into a box, but a key is required to move coins to another box. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:38:17
Yeah that makes sense. :) We could extend this a bit to follow current currency conventions:
* 1 = one bit cent
* 100 = one bit dollar
* 1000 = one thousand bit cents
* 1000000 = one million bit cents
* 100000000 = 1 bitcoin

I agree and I meant 1 satoshi = 1 bit. I updated my text to reflect that. [edit] I see, "bit" as singular or plural. Could make sense.

I think we should jump straight to "satoshi" and just call them 1 "bit". So if you now own 1 bitcoin, you own 100,000,000 bits. It is easier to think of bits in terms of millions or thousands, not tiny decimals. If bitcoin goes where I'm hoping it goes, 1 bitcoin could be worth 100,000 USD, and in  that case 1 bit could be a very useful denomination. Until then, we can just refer to values of items in millions or thousands. For instance, today you can get a happy meal for   20 million bits, or just 20mb. At some point a happy meal may be more like 1000 bits or so, or 1.24kb. If I own a whole bitcoin, then I am a 100 million bit owner. That sounds like a lot, but guess what? It is! One day it will be unheard of to own an entire bitcoin, as they are so rare and spread across the globe in such small bits.
[edit] This jump will serve two purposes: 1) make thinking of bitcoin and values easier to comprehend: and 2) open a psychological barrier of entry to bitcoins and make it more digestible: you get thousands of things for your $, not one thing. After all, widespread adoption is a very good thing for the success of bitcoin.

There needs to be big lawsuits that make headline news about the prejudice taking place in banks. Bitcoin is not illegal. Bitcoin is not about drug trade. What you do with your money is your business. This is like banning your account because of a transaction with PayPal. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:52:53
Maybe not. Talking prices in hundreds of thousands of bits probably isn't the clearest solution either.

I like the idea of calling 1 uBTC a "bit". Makes sense in conversation.

The "old" naming convention is purely for familiarity. So one argument is to use terms that are familiar so the layman can get a quick idea what you are referring to. The other argument is to abandon familiar currency terms and move to everything "bit" and just make people adjust to the new convention.

The problem is perception, ie. psychological barrier. Most any noob I talk to is under the presumption that they cannot afford Bitcoins. If we start referring to mBTC or uBTC in casual conversation, suddenly Bitcoins are more approachable. 
Referring in fractions is also psychological devaluation. If we talk about an amount they can buy a handful of rather cheap, now they are suddenly more accepting. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:34:08
I started down this route, but ran into terminologies already used in other mediums such as megabit, gigabit, etc. So I started with something already familiar with currency values: cents, dollars, and grands.
