I mean, 450 kWh is damn near double the value I mentioned and brings the cost to about $54 a transaction.  That's even worse.
The "creation" of the bitcoin takes no energy. Its confirming the ledgers and transactions that takes the energy, issuing a bitcoin is rewarding someone for that effort.

The per transaction energy cost for of a bitcoin compared to a CC is 1:100,000.  
The reason the entire banking system uses more energy as a whole is because bitcoin does about 3 thousand transactions a day, whereas visa alone does that many in less than 2 seconds.

The fed “printing” money uses as much energy as adding a few lines to an excel document.

I don't think its disingenuous. Saying that all that energy is going towards processing transactions is correct. Rewarding miners with BTC is energy free, and a way of paying for the energy needed to complete the transaction by effectively "printing money".
You are correct that there are a few ideas like SegWit and Lightning that are working to address the issue, but they are incremental changes when compared to the order of magnitude in transaction fees that are needed to remotely compete with traditional transaction methods.  In addition the energy needed and blockchain lengths are increasing while the incentive to mine gets lowered (halved as BTCs become more rare).
The article you linked to directly says this: 
"However, this does pose some interesting questions for miners in the future. Once all 21 mln Bitcoin have been mined, transaction fees will be the only incentive for miners.  However, 100 years from now, it seems likely that all of these problems will have been answered by Bitcoin Core developers and the wider cryptocurrency community."
Which basically says, "yeah the problem is pretty bad and set to get worse as BTCs are halved, but I'm sure someone somewhere will figure it out"  &lt;--This is not a good investment strategy.
And most importantly, the main economic incentive is not there. **There is no driver to solve the energy problem. The main developers for BTC have hundreds of millions riding on a high valuation, that valuation only exists because the reward for mining needs to be greater than the energy cost. Lower the energy cost, lower the value of BTC.**

High valuations do not demonstrate anything other than a trend towards higher valuations, not ultimate success.
Gold is used in electronics, computers, medicine and dentistry. And (in case you haven't noticed) it hasn't been used for financial transactions for about 500 years.
Current energy cost for a BTC transaction is 245 kWh. At $0.12 a kWh, that's ~$30 in energy use per transaction. Nobody is going to pay $30 in transaction fees for anything less than moving thousands of dollars around.

Edit Two: fixed magnitude error.
Two Points: Money is classified as M0 through M3, only M0 and M1 are physical printed money, everything else is electronic.  M0 and M1 account for only 10% of all USD in existance, 90% of it is virtual. Which takes nearly no energy to create. 
Additionally, using the stats you have provided 0.35 MMGJ+0.45 MMGJ= 224,000 kWh.  The entirety of M1 = 1,388 billion USD and bills have an average life of about 5 years.  It takes the fed 7 kWh to physically print $9,000. It take Bitcoin 250kWh to do the same  **The energy efficiency of physical print money vs bitcoin is 1:33, the energy efficiency of electronic USD vs BC is 1:100,000**

You are straight up spare parts bud.
The fed printing money now a days is  virtually energy free. Its as easy as them adding a few lines to their reserve credits.
Are you suggesting that a bitcoin transaction takes less energy than printing paper money? Do you think it costs $50 to print a twenty dollar bill?

I'm still here, lurking around, laughing at all the gamblers focused only on price and waiting for to see a real solution to the massive energy use issue.
It will either succeed or it wont, but if it does it wont be because of a bunch of HODLRs and Speculators.

About 20% of gold is used for industrial purposes.
And as far as the energy use. Its easy to find multiple verifiable sources for this value.  I'm not going to do your research for you.
The fact that you aren't aware of its per transaction energy use, shows how speculative the bitcoin market is. People invest without understanding even the most basic parts of its economics.

I don't see how issuing a BTC solves the economic problem of having that high of a transaction cost, and what happens when there are no more BTCs to reward?
