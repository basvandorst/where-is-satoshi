You're entirely missing the point that the Bitcoin blockchain simply was not designed or envisioned to run smart contracts. To do so would be like trying to drive a car on the ocean (which is incredibly difficult unless it is amphibious, which unfortunately continuing the simile, Bitcoin is not).
Dont you think if it had been feasible for ethereum to implement itself thus, [it would have done](
Ethereum's place will be as mediator for the thousands of blockchains that will eventually very easily be able to communicate to eachother in the not too distant future. Bitcoin will continue to have its place as a transactor of worth, but other more specialised chains will pick up the slack elsewhere.
After all, isn't running everything on Bitcoin not a little bit... centralised?

Time to distance ourselves from the Bitcoin Foundation. 
I don't think it really serves the average "bitcoiner" anyway, it seems more like an engine which works for the members own purposes and benefit. Just another economic entity hidden behind a veil of community.
Where's the multinational representation? If bitcoin is going to work, a bunch of rich white guys aren't going to do it on their own. We need strong relations with the rest of the world. It is after all a global currency...

Well I guess you could just utilise game theory to disincentivise the centralisation of mining...

Don't meet their demands! Speak to a professional.
How can you even guarantee they will do as they say once you have paid them?

Basically it's a Counterparty-like protocol inside a Ethereum smart contract written in 340 lines of serpent code.
It's actually pretty neat.

I had a look at Coinfloor when it first opened and I do like it. The GUI is slick and if UK Faster Payments come to pass then I may move a more sizeable amount of coin on there. As other have said though the volume is very small. Chicken and the egg issue.
Also Nefario (unfortunate name, sounds like "Nefarious") does look to have lost some coins in the past. Maybe in a way its a good thing... People do learn from their mistakes.
On another note, has anyone noticed the frequency of exchanges getting hit has largely declined recently?

Incorrect, the whole point of this PoS system is to have worth stuck in the system should you try to attack it. In the same way, the value you had to enter into the system would be worthless like any mining equipment bought for PoW.

I think the acceptance of bitcoin for USA political campaigns was a massive nod of acceptance that was hugely underplayed. 
Also the fact that it just works. It's not tied to any single entity, there is no customer support number or anything like that because it's not needed.
Finally the huge amount of venture capital raised by some seriously influential people(Branson/ ka shing). They've made some pretty fantastic decisions in the past to get to where they are today. I think they have a pretty good idea of what bitcoin will become, and they are backing the idea with serious financial input.

Pools closed to everyone but the big 4.
Looks pretty centralised to me.

Thank you gents, do you have any specific views on Ether?
Having digested their marketing spiel, It seems that any Ether bought at this point will help finance their future endeavors. 
As time goes on I too am starting to see the the true brilliance/worth of Bitcoin is not in the individual coins but the Blockchain itself. 
Ether, from what I gather so far is the "crypto fuel" behind the Ether Blockchain, ergo it carries more intrinsic value as it is required to use the services made possible by the Ethereum Blockchain.
Is it worth putting a few Bitcoins into?
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:46:13
Mommathcat you have a point. Much of the power in Bitcoin is very much centralized. 
However, as much as it is an accurate view of how things currently stand, it does not take into account how things will change in the future.
We are so early in Bitcoin's potential lifespan that there is still a great amount of time for things to change. 
As Bitcoin based businesses in other areas of the world (BRICs - India, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia and LEDCs - Nigeria, Kenya, Afganistan etc) begin to grow they will begin to challenge the current domination of USA based companies (as is occurring in many other industries).
If Bitcoin can just survive for a few more years and start putting some significant roots down in the aforementioned countries, I think centralization will become less of a problem. 
Also, I almost wouldn't be surprised if its price went back down to almost zero. This would cause a huge surge of exceptionally cheap Bitcoin to hit the market from the current large holders. This would help even out the overall distribution and lower the overall coin ownership concentration.
Also on Peter Schiff - He has absolutely no reason to plug Bitcoin, as others has mentioned the only reason he accepts Bitcoin is as a proxy for a new potential market to sell gold to. He is a CEO of a Gold company, the fact that anyone believes Bitcoin is allegorical to gold means the two by definition compete with each other.

At this point, I dont see why that is important. Bitcoin is either going to be a thing or isnt. It's the people who are building the cool tech on top that will make the difference.

Bitcoin will be available on the Ethereum blockchain through 2-way pegs. I think EtherEx (smart contract exchange) is implementing this now. Also google 'btc-relay Ethereum'

So whats this then? 395 upvotes. Still not removed. 
Ethereum is pretty interesting stuff and without a doubt moving the whole crypto-space forward. It *is* relevant to Bitcoin. Way more than Greece anyway...

Dont worry Peter, nor will most Bitcoiners. A select few in China make the market and no one else.

I'm sorry guys. I did try, honest!
@_date: 2015-04-16 11:23:32
Right!? 
What exactly did people expect Factom to do with the money it raised?
Not use it for the further development, paying for wages, legal council, office space, administration (90% of which must be paid for in fiat as there is no alternative) and just hold onto it and let the technology develop itself?
When did it become such a crime to actually USE Bitcoin? 
The negative reaction to this is just insane. Completely and utterly insane. When people say this kind of thing - "there can only be one crypto!", "They're killing Bitcoin by converting it to fiat" It just reminds me that Bitcoin is dying, and that makes me sad.

No one takes into account the fact that BTC has dropped over 50% since the Ethereum crowdsale took place (*don't worry it's good for Bitcoin guys).
No wonder they are running out of money! It is pretty stupid to keep funds in an asset that is tanking in price so heavily!
*disclaimer - I dont own any Ether, going to wait for launch in April or whenever it is and see.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:16:10
Firstly, it's spelt "Ethereum".
Misspelling a key word on a subject you are vocalising an opinion on basically shows you dont actually know what's going on.
Ethereum is ENTIRELY open source. Were the devs only interested in "Etherium", why is it that anyone can come and take that software right now and do whatever they like with it? 
The reason why Ethereum is cash strapped is because they werent clever enough enough (or trusted bitcoin too much) to get the hell out of the trainwreck that is Bitcoin in the last 6 months - the price had dropped over 50% and as a consequence so has Ethereum's inital funding. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:22:26
Ethereum lost it's money because of the drop in the price in Bitcoin, not because if a 100K a day burn rate.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:54:44
Can confirm, the Ethereum software is pretty soilid (to the uninitiated, this is punny as the contract orientated internal programming language is called Solidity).
Seriously though, I do wish Ethereum had launched today, but as long as we arent waiting months, I can wait.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:19:45
Had Ethereum not held their Bitcoin (they could have liquidated it all immediately after the crowdsale killing BTC btw) then they would have almost DOUBLE the money they have right now.
Why is this you ask? Because the price of Bitcoin has DROPPED 50% over the time since the crowdsale. So basically they lost their money because they were too nice not to sell all the BTC straight away and got caught in the massive price drop in BTC.
