Well i dumped my 0.btc from exchange to the paper wallet.
Inside mycelium i didnt move it to another adress, its been the same original adress the whole time.
My confusion was that it seemed that for importing the paper wallet to mycelium to monitor it, without having it being moved to a new adress, meant that it was now in my phone/mycelium and not in the paper wallet anymore.

wait a minute, i made a paper wallet and sent my stuff there.
in mycelium i added the cold storage and removed the key so that no one could spend the content if they stole the phone, if i check the address on blockchaininfo it still has the contents there.
im sure mycelium did not swipe my cold storage and move  the btc to its wallet, or am i wrong???

Mnh.. i first created wallet, its password encrypted, sent some btc to it  (from my exchange) and extracted back to exchange (using mycelium)
Then i send more to it from the exchange (with the paper adress) and checking it on blockchain its there on that wallet.
I wanted to keep and eye of the contents with mycelium, so i delete the key in mycelium so that i could not spend it. (the app told me this was a way to keep it as watch only)
Im pretty much certain the btc is still on the paper wallet and mycelium is only checking on it, and is not in my phone/mycelium wallet at all.
I did read the guides about apps swipping the paper wallet contents, but i never came up to such step, blockchain has always show the contents in the paper wallet.

Ok just to clarify for anyone reading my ramblings and getting confused.
Mycelium supports adding external wallet adresses into it, so that you can send btc from them to other wallets (in my case paper wallet)
This is not storing the btc into the main mycelium wallet,(wihc is empty for me). You are poking and spending from the wallet (my paper wallet) and since its bit38 protected, it asks for the pass when importing, and then its ready to spend, you can delete the key so that you only monitor the wallet and cant spend it(if you lose you phone, they would need to know the pass to spend it)
my Paper wallet is no longer a cold storage since ive already send out from it, and the transactions are open for public, its only cold storage if i dump into it and never spend from it (but how would i verify i can spend from it?)
Oh well, time to move funds again, probably into a segwit wallet. and hope i dont fk up and lock myself out of it by not testing it first.

You see those dips after those sudden surges? thats where we are right now.
Look at how it rises so much and steadily over a long period after those dips

I dont think thats how blockchain works
Its just a txt ledger of transactions
