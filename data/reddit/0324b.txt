If you're looking for a long-term investment I think you should buy in chunks bigger than 10€. Buying once per several months will save you a decent amount of money that otherwise will be lost in transactions between wallets and withdrawal fees of your exchange.

Well, only for the generation of the public key and only on safe hardware. After that step I don't rely on electronic devices - such as Trezor and that kind of stuff - because I'm afraid of possible hardware faults. I'm a hodler, I don't need to move around my coins so I prefer paper.
Computing the public key by hand will require a few hours and it's not impossible by the way.
You can even mine Bitcoin with [pencil and paper]( ^/s

At some point Bitcoin will face quantum computing, that's true. Before that point it is almost certain that sha256 and secp256k1 will be replaced by something else.

Hmm I don't think so, the four devs behind this project are mainly javascript programmers. They want easy cash with a shitty app and ads.

Well, I read your post though. A cryptocurrency centralised around a government, seems promising. Nice try Maduro, nice try.

Big centralised news aggregators and, as they say on their site - *advanced statistical algorithms* that forecast the price - are not a good idea in my opinion. I think they may spread disinformation very easily. *Advanced statistical algorithms*, what a bullshit.


*Before they take place*. There's nothing more to say.

Stop begging and buy some BTC

Let's build a big, beautiful, powerful *buy*-wall!

It's BS. Past performance does not predict future results. That application is a simple neural network trained on past data, obviously. Good marketing though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:10:02
There is a wall at 10,000€ that's why people are shorting! They don't know the wall will be broken very soon, hodl.

Github doesn't allow the execution of Python scripts in the static webpages hosted on github.com. That's the app they will release, check the source code.

Paper wallet, hexadecimal representation of the private keys, 2 minutes. If you understand the cryptography behind a cryptocurrency I think it's the safest way to store your coins: no electronics involved.

I think we should create some issues on their [github]( page and notify them that such applications are total BS. Good marketing though, but very misleading.
Edit: I checked the project, their magnificent sentiment indicator is written in 42 lines of Python. Stay away from such apps.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:25:23
Check their source code on github and read my post about the application [here]( it's BS.
