Just most basic and dirty analysis says [otherwise]( but then again it is quick and dirty.

Correct me if I'm wrong, I would think the demand for bitcoins would go up and since there is a finite known amount wouldn't the price go up? Supply and Demand?

They are probably getting ready to accept bitcoins, not mine them.

Yes now you get what I'm saying. The correlation when casino's revenues started drying up and the amount of money dumped into the markets was pari passu. 
That's a great example of speculative betting you mentioned in dot come bubble, except this bubble is large is popping slowly and painfully. 
The point is that there is *a lot* of speculative betting in China going on today, hell they even ramped up the price of bitcoins.

So why is demand decreasing or are we being pumped with too much BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:51:19
So is smallpox

What will stop the plummet of BTC? 
Is this the new floor ~$250?
Why doesn't supply vs demand factor into BTC like every other finite object on earth?

I'm in it for long term but I'm a scaredy cat to buy it @ $270 if its going to be $180 in a month. I still care about dollar value because most things I buy in BTC are still correlated with dollar value.

If you work on a desk, show me you're b terminal if you do. I actually do and can show you proof. I feel if you do work at a desk then you know for a fact assumptions coupled with TA are used constantly.
There is no evidence TA is statically proven more times wrong that right. Please show me the research.

No one asked for your opinion on WSB either, move along 
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:42:59
Kind of like how bitcoins won't take over the world or be dominate form of currency widely accepted.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:42:13
TA is literally historical evidence..

The % of gamblers in Chinese markets vs Amerian markets staggering much higher.  Literally casino profits dropped off a cliff and market investments nearly quadrupled since 2014
No one takes this narrative in the US because 50% of total investors aren't gamblers. Funny how your link shows Americans are 3rd to last in that chart.

Whatever you think, I've seen some real dirty trades where fortunes are made and lost with real TA &amp; balls of steel. Not just speculation about a crypto that you feel everyone will adapt with its flawed blockchain.

When I get back into the office tomorrow I'll back them up. I've backed them up on r/wallstreetbets but my comment history is quite long since that post in August. I'll find the data again, no worries.

I'm gonna sound racist but fuck it.
Asians love to gamble. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 20:19:23
Time to short bitcoins

The fuck you think this r/wallstreetbets where you play options?

You do realize you need to file and IRS document to withdraw and or deposit anything above $9,999.99 from your bank account?

It comes from here, a single coin.

I just buy and sell them
