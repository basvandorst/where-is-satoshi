Namecoin uses merged mining and Sidechains will also be using merged mining.
The only benefit of making Namecoin into a Sidechain is that it will use the native BTC currency rather than being an alt. The disadvantage is that with sidechains the miner can only generate revenue from domain name sales/transaction fees whereas with Namecoin they earn from both domain name sales/transaction fees and block rewards. However, this could be an advantage as it will give the miners the incentive to increase the domain name pricing which will prevent domain squatters (Namecoin has this problem because it's very cheap to buy a .bit domain name).

Does anyone here know of a client-side JS firefox(and thus TOR) extension (like Darkwallet once it's finished) that I can use _right now_ to send/recieve bitcoins by me manually writing my private key into the extension (it's currently in cold storage)?
Blockchain.info I would use but I don't trust them - so I want all of the javascript to be offline/in the extension so it's trustless.
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:19:40
Thank you for this, it's brilliant.
Please can you add the ability to sweep from my private key or even use my own private key (whichever is the easiest to implement)?
Is Copay coming to Firefox so it can be used in the TOR browser?
I'd rock of Darkwallet team could use Copay's design, currently Copay looks miles better than Darkwallet.

Cool, I've never used Coinbase, when you make a payment with a bitcoin:[btc_address] URL, I assume this redirects you to Coinbase to pay in the wallet... does Coinbase have a custom subscription parameter in the bitcoin URL yet or does it require webmasters to redirect users to Coinbase for the payments in order to ask for the subscription?
I'd like to see it become a standardized bitcoin URL parameter.

@_date: 2014-12-29 20:02:48
What you say is true, the model is designed for users who forget to unsubscribe. BUT, it's also intended for intended subscriptions too. Because by re-showing the 'Pay now' button once a month *does* result in a lower amount of recurring payers because of inconvinence. A bit like how Mozilla recently said that they hide the Bitcoin payment method from their donation page because they noticed less people were donating. Even the slightest inconvinence or confusion does result in fewer sales.
Bitcoin wallets will support subscriptions in the future, it's inevitable as businesses using bitcoin start demanding it.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:52:32
I'm under the impression it still is possible using nLockTime. This gives the user the ability to subscribe to transactions which happen in the future but also gives them the ability to cancel that transaction by spending the coins before the due date. I'm pretty sure in the future wallets will support the feature assuming bitcoin becomes mainstream (when wallet developers stop being motivated to keep the r/bitcoin community happy and instead priorities what businesses are asking for). Also, services which store your bitcoins for you, such as Circle/Coinbase can add the ability to do subscriptions just like how PayPal does it by altering the bitcoin URL address to be like "bitcoin://[btc address]?amount=5&amp;subscribe=1Y" so the wallets and payment processors who support subscriptions would then subscribe you.
I'm pretty confident to say that it will happen at some stage, not until it's gone mainstream though.

For cards, there isn't a service (too much chargeback risk) but for bank transfers you can use Cashila.com if they are sending via SEPA. Also, you can use advcash.com. If you're doing this method because you're struggling to get a bitcoin friendly bank account you could use cryptocapital.co/coinapult.com to open a bank account and receive money then exchange it all on their platform.
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:35:40
It has a 50 EUR daily limit and a 500 EUR monthly limit (
It's not much but considering it's anonymous and requires barely any ID (a phone number, which can easily be an anonymous using txtlocal.com), it's alright.
Another great method would be anxcard, but they require a photo of your ID as proof. Payoneer doesn't require proof of ID until you hit a "red flag" limit (estimated to be a $10k transaction to set off the red flag), but Payoneer refuses to work with bitcoin related companies because of their banks whitelist policy (to *recieve* money).

This sub downvotes critical thinking or anything which they don't want to hear. Even if you're pro-bitcoin, giving a comment which is deemed slightly not to the level of "to the moon" will be downvoted. In the old days, this sub used to be far better, I'm under the impression that it's now filled with mainly teenagers who want to become rich from owning a single bitcoin. What really shows how bad this sub is, is that when going on to you'll see more rational comments than over here. It's a shame the subreddit and coinspotting.com are barely used. Here come the downvotes and comments which claim this sub is very critical thinking to the standard of HN and push their economic theory about bitcoins price even though their only economic education is from watching the kieserreport. /end rant

I'd like to add, Namecoin (or a sidechain version of it) is more than a DNS replacement or a CA alternative. It's a key-value store at heart, so developers can use it however they desire - imagine a firefox extension which once installed makes every (safe://example.com) website when typed into the address bar connect to the maidsafe network. Developers can do all sorts of similar things since it's easily tweakable JSON. SSL and DNS wouldn't be seperated as well. Currently browsers connect to http by default because DNS doesn't tell the browser that the website is SSL enabled, browsers can detect the {"ssl"=&gt;[ssl_key]} in the blockchain and connect to SSL by default on that certain website. In addition to all that sexy spice, email addresses can become 'ID cards' which not only give the MX type records but also give their bitcoin address, paypal account etc in an array type fashion for developers to use email addresses for more than just emails in a secure way. I hope whoever developers the sidechain DNS will make it so this is all standardized so we don't have the DNS situation which is that TXT records could be used to do similar things but it's so bloated with registrars which make DNS a painful process it just hasn't happened (just like the mass adoption of SSL which hasn't happened because it's been made in a way which is confusing to the average website owner).
Not sure if I got my point across, the ideas been in my head for a while but I'm not good with explaining. Sidechain DNS will be very important for decentralized apps - it could also enabled decentralized websites, in-browser, making it very easy for the common man to use it without having to install anything.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:26:06
It wont be zeronet, it will be more like Storj since he wants to get rid of the legal liability of owning a site like mega (if it was decentralized, mega would technically just be a 'linking' site). Also, Kimble doesn't have the intention to create something like zeronet since zeronet is aimed at getting rid of "the middle man", mega is currently the middle man and he wants to keep it that way.
How I see it, it'll be Storj but he'll have thought more about reducing liability - 1 example: by adding a "recreate link to file" like he had on megaupload but it happens within the network rather than on his server so he can claim plausible deniability so when he gets a DMCA he'll remove the link but with other links still up - ultimately killing dmcas effectiveness.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:55:36
You've got your history mixed up. MEGA (mega.nz) he didn't develop himself but Megaupload he did build along with I think it was 2 other developers initially.

This is fantastic. Another thing I'd love to see is if you could get a merchant account partnership with your bank and allow credit card payments for those who don't have bitcoin yet. Stripe.com allows both bitcoin &amp; cc payments but doesn't let us recieve it *in* bitcoins rather than sending it to our bank account (I'd like 50% in bitcoins, 50% sent to our bank).
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:34:54
Yes that's right. It's a cool service you're offering, normally there is a sign up process when getting cards. So you're beating advcash in that regards.
Normally buying prepaid cards has a high fee, so I'm assuming you've got a high fee because you have to account for the fee the card provider charges you. If your service takes off, you could consider getting in contact with a card issuer company, advcash uses wavecrest.gi to issue their cards for example.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:09:15
Couldn't you lower the fees a bit? Your competition, advcash, lets me top up $10 on to a virtual card, delivered instantly and I just pay a $1.99 fee. If I reuse the card for an additional top up, it's a $0.99 fee.

Bitcoiners a while back considered sidechains + zerocoin to be the answer, but since the block limit debate, everyone appears to hate sidechains and maxwell. So not much hope for the average joe. tumbling exists but once you tumble it sends hypothetical red alerts to people analysing the network. I hope sidechains do become a reality. Offchain altcoin exchanges and offchain gambling sites are the best way without triggering red lights. If "Othercoin" gets developed, that could also be a good way for anonymous bitcoins (offline bitcoin payments, no traces of the origin of payments on a public ledger, no traces even on a private ledger depending on how they decide to impliment it).

I'd much rather go down the sidechain route and make the current blockchain become a miners chain and have a main chain with instant confirmations with PoS w/ "nothing at stake" solved (possibly tendermint's method?). The truth of the matter is bitcoin's current blockchain is very inefficient and will increasingly become expensive (once all btc is mined, transaction fees *will* be high but people keep ignoring this or say it's a 'free market' but mining is a monopoly of a few groups).

@_date: 2015-07-22 22:07:28

Another website I'm quite interested in finding is one where I can quickly send bitcoins to them and instantly get a prepaid debit card with the amount of bitcoins I sent. There is Abine.com which does something similar but they don't accept bitcoin for the masked card service.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:15:11
What made you decide to use Nubits over Bitreserve? You now have to pay fees per transaction and you have to hope that Nubits remains pegged. I considered doing the same thing but I felt that using Nubits introduces too many risks, more so than using a centralized service. But I quite like the sound of not having to worry about Coinbase or Bitreserve freezing my account.

The same question applies to "billions of tx's are being performed on mainchain".
Bitcoin *may* *hypothetically* not get that volume of transactions. It's not safe to just assume you'll land on the moon to your level of expectation.
With a PoS chain, it goes back to increasing the decentralization of the network, it would also improve the confirmation times and would dramatically resolve the scalability issues which PoW faces.

Never personally tried it but they say that using Purse.io to 'Earn' bitcoins by purchasing a product for someone from Amazon is a way to semi-anonymously purchase bitcoins. As long as Purse.io keeps the database logs private, then there wont be any public link between Amazon and your bitcoins. If you pay for someone on amazon with a fake account and use a prepaid card or a gift card, then you would be entirely anonymous if you managed to purchase said cards anonymously as well.
Alternatively, buy bitcoins with cash but risk getting mobbed.

It *is* actually possible to detect the card type as there are databases of card number patterns that allow you to detect. As for whether the card processor (merchant account) lets you detect, I've never seen one that does. However, Stripe[1] appears to be offering the detection, so either their doing the first method I mentioned or their merchant account provider gives them the information.

The article shows Coinbase never raised an issue with the scheme (and the scheme is ofc dodgy but not illegal but probably in violation of Coinbase's terms), the main point of the article is that Coinbase promotes getting paid when users spend 100 CAD/100 GBP/100 EUR/100 USD but in the support ticket they say they're only paying for 100 USD&lt; payments, which is false advertising.

If it's non-internet connected, using a mobile network, then it wont be using bitcoins blockchain but an inbuilt blockchain. But it's have to be a small blockchain otherwise it wouldn't be able to host on peoples mobiles. Mobiles can't scale to be as big as the internet, so it sounds like a small exclusive network for protesters to communicate securely on, like an encrypted Firechat.

Is zerocash post-quantum-proof? I'm under the impression stealth isn't because it publicly exposes part of your public key. We need privacy tools which can also protect us from future advances in computers. Offline or Offchain based privacy tools which can easily be used would be preferable IMO. Maybe put bitcoins into a zerocash sidechain, and from there use an offchain post-quantum encryption based tumbler (which accepts zerocash addresses) and then convert back to bitcoin's blockchain and then you should have truly private bitcoins which don't have links to you and is "hypothetical-future proof".
Even if the off-chain tumbler doesn't use strong crypto, at least it breaks the link on the public ledger so it wont be linked to your identity unless it was the NSA who archives all internet traffic for future decryption but atleast the police and your neighbors wont ever find out (unless you did something to piss off the NSA).

I don't like him but seriously, your comment is misguided. He didn't get lucky, he knew his business model would work as he had already successfully perfected it from his BBS website (give uploaders an incentive, get downloaders to pay for access).

I'm not an economist, I'm making an observation/guess. Countries originally used Gold reserves because it's the "base value" at times of crisis. As cex.io went out of business because it went below $200, the price bounced up again. If it does go under $200, I believe that might tell us whether or not the price has a "base value" of sorts, as Satoshi originally thought using computer resources gave something it's initial value. So it'll be interesting to see if the price does go below $200 again. If anyone is genuinely an economist here, I'd be interested in hearing the response to my assumption.
