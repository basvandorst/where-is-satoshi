Try lnd. With it you don't even have to run a full node - it uses an integrated neutrino light client

I'm currently trying out a lnd node on Windows and it works fine. Managing channels through the command line is a pain in the ass, but you can also check [lightning-app]( for a GUI client. It seems to have some hiccups on Windows so I gave it up eventually.

This is not a valid criticism, I'm afraid. If you want to convince anyone, you should state your objections clearly, so that they can be discussed. What's the problem with using the word "rational" as a technical term, as long as it's clearly defined?

Austrian economics makes no such assumptions. Mises frequently uses the word "rational" to describe human decision processes, but if you read up on his definition of "rational", you'll see that what he really means is "motivated" or "purposeful". In short, the only thing that Austrians assume is that humans act by moving from states of lower perceived value (where value judgements are purely subjective and may take into account things like altruism) to states of higher perceived value (ex ante). This assumption is not really disputable, as far as I'm concerned.

Let me rephrase your question:
Is anyone interested in an empty bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:08:23
Sure, I have no problem with that. I'm just under the impression that this sub consists almost exclusively of memes and price speculation :)
