Aren't the individual transactions also propagated to peers on the network? So the blocks would be in addition to any transactions, unless the blocks received by peers only reference the transactions? 
Edit: the documentation I've seen so far suggests that blocks contain transaction records and not just references to transactions, therefore, over the network, one will likely receive blocks containing transactions in addition to individual transactions. Have I got that right?

This website looks incredibly dodgy - a hastily thrown together Joomla site, with poor graphics and copy (what little of it there is), with any information that may be of use (FAQs &amp; T&amp;Cs) requiring a login. Incredible.
I've only just started taking an interest in bitcoin, but I've already seen so many bad, clearly unprofessional websites, likely with some of the worst security you can imagine. If so much attention to detail has been lost on just the user-facing aspect of an application, how much of the backend business logic has been hacked together in a bid to get something out there while bitcoin is still in a volatile state on the market?
I would avoid. Like the plague.

**AND THEY HAVE NO SSL! I've checked the login page, there is no SSL as is claimed by u/dotcoin.**

I'm in two minds on bootstrap... one the one hand, it means anybody can knock together something crisp, clean and good looking in next to no time. On the other hand, it means _anybody_ can knock together something crisp, clean and good looking in next to no time.

Sorry to raise the dead, but how did you manage a bank transfer with blockchain? The only options I see are for American residents. There are no deposit options for European/UK residents.
