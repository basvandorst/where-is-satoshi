the fees were almost 100$ when we reached the peak around a month ago, they have fallen since, look where that has gotten us. If the fees are high people will value the precious coins more, they will also keep more coins because selling is expensive, look beyond the obvious.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:21:17
the dominance is imploding!
We had 60% a month ago, now down to 33%!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:03:26
not everyone is a lemming assuming status-quo is brilliantly smart. I am an economist and what I see happening here is just blundering economics terribly. An additional transaction a month ago would have caused the same costs as one yesterday, yet its price was 80$ compared higher -&gt; failure to apply economics correctly.

HODL now
That is the great thing about fees. People wanting to SODL will be stopped.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:58:59
the fee level is debatable, but constant fees are clearly superior to constant blocksize
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:35:00
i want to restrict it in a reasonable way. If there is a lot of demand on  a train from A to B a waggon will be added. If there is not a lot of demand for this train you will reduce the size. We had an excess demand for bitcoin transport last month, couldnt react and now the shit is fuming as they are gone to the ethereum network. Now there is no demand and almost zero fee spam is included in the blocks.

you dont't think privacy is important for a currency?
you will see how wrong you are when governments start to crack down on this.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:34:48
this sounds arbitrary.... if the lightning network is supposed to be private it should be impossible to discern, no?
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:19:36
lot s of spam transactions stored forever in the blockchain, just saying. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:51:02
Nailed it. And since we rely on Chinese miners supporting Bcash, it is paramount to have a strong network. Otherwise reliable persons have insinuated to me that an attack might be coming later this year.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:21:37
i paid 60$ myself
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:36:22
it is more or less at the limit at all times regardless of demand.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:53:57
it is time to wake up to reality. What is supplied here is one airplane every 10 minutes (roughly). what could be supplied with equal costs would be more airplanes when demand is high and less if it is low. That is a clearly superior solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:38:31
but we will lose this spot if we lose decentralization. Our coin has to be the most decentralized possible. Only in this way we can secure the long term claim to be digital gold. 
It is important to keep fighting for this, to keep sacrificing, we do not need immediate gratification. Look at how far the long term approach has got us. We cannot compete with ripple regarding payments but we are lightyears ahead in terms of decentralization. Let s face it, it is either digital gold, or nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:25:02
why would i reply to nonsense?
It is clear to everyone with half a brain, that you should supply more capacity in times of need and less when there is less need. This is especially true if you assume blockspace is a problem. The smarter people like Vitalik have already understood this, here i m trying to "educate the fish".
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:17:05
the experts say otherwise
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:34:18
People have left for the ethereum network and now with korea down apparently half of our transactions are gone.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:15:21
Do not use Segwit... it will just bloat the blocksize out of proportion. The amount of nodes we have is already an order of magnitude too small. It is digital gold and this has to be preserved at all costs. 
If people want to do transactions, there is litecoin, ethereum, shitcoin cash or centralization coin cripple. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:42:44
Price of a good should equal marginal cost to produce that good. 
As the marginal cost to produce it is fairly constant the fees should be as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:28:56
look we cant compete on payments, payments will ultimately clog the blockspace and leave the project worthless. The ethereum transactions are faster and uses more capacity, we cannot compete as a payment network, we should focus on our strength as digital gold.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:59:51
that is sort of ... a problem for an aspiring currency. If transaction volume can vanish quickly so can price. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:30:10
how would it know?
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:31:26
I remember it was 250$ at some point... so we got it quite close to 0.
with the Coins from Conbase we might have done it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:09:38
Don't fall for Rogers propaganda! In order to not get replaced by newer currencies in the future we have to keep the blocksize bloat small. It is a store of value because we have the longest track record and the best developers. We need to send a clear signal to the market that we are trustworthy not to compromise the store of value in order to facilitate what is mostly spam.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:27:57
Sure, but all the transactions currently made will be forever in the blockchain. As Bitcoin is here to stay we need to be very careful not to acquire too much legacy debt in form of spam that every single future node will have to store. I imagine a future where everyone is running a full node and the costs of carrying all these spam transactions is a huge problem. That is why I d suggest lowering the blocksize now and probably further when lightning activates as it should reduce the need for space. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:06:22
exactly, it is clearly not. If only we had more s in the Bitcoin community. Facing the unconvenient truths is just to hard for the majority.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:20:29
it is not a market price with restricted blocksize rules.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:03:13
the frenzy will subside if it is not backed by real growth of purchases.
the "fee market" was the worst idea ever imo.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:38:36
in this case a price control which is to be periodically adjusted would work better than the quantity control we have. 
It would allow predictable fees, reliable transactions, more effiency 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:23:40
Spam transactions contaminating the blocks for years to come are immensely costly. Have you calculated the storage cost of a transaction if everyone is to run a full node in the future? It is immense, we cannot allow people to externalize their costs on future users of Bitcoin.
Apart from that, it appears Segwit might have a security problem. Apparently, industry leaders are very reluctant to put it in place. We need to be careful here, as security is always more important than cheap transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:46:25
yup, i mean it was tough to imagine that people would get in at a good price when they tried to buy all at once. Whenever there is queue of people waiting to get in, the price is inflated.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:38:00
very possible, we had a 10x increase in price with user base not even doubling and a severe loss of market share.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:55:26
It cannot be quantified as there are not enough resources on earth to produce the amount of storage necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:25:41
If we require by law that a constant amount of taxis should be around at any time of the day, week, month and year we would also get a "market price". This price will oscillate widely. The sensible thing is to provide more taxis when demand is high and less if it is low. BTC did not do the equivalent of this and now the shit fuming because merchants have dropped it after the fee disaster last month and are incorporating other solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:53:28
it is transaction volume measured in $. as the dollar is fairly stable in value, it is down by 60%. This implies that TA is probably speculative in nature because if it was not people would now need more Bitcoins for the same amount of purchases.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:25:40
you think taking 80$ a month ago and now giving away space for free is in any way consistent? Economically if a transaction causes a certain future social cost it should have a certain price. So what we need is a minimum fee that equals the cost of contamination of the blockchain.

 0.00001 BTC
Can this get there by chance? 
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:58:55
the problem is that once people start paying more, there will be a spiral upwards until enough users stop making transactions. If your wallet chooses the wrong fee, your transaction will be stuck for hours.
Ultimately people will leave though and that will make the transactions spill over to altcoins fueling their adoption, while Bitcoin is unreliable when congested. We need more space or quick scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:00:13
wow, we plunged even further, below 100000.... 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:11:48
so we are imploding again!!!
Adam Back told us it was a store of value, now it is IMPLODING!!
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:28:24
completely imploding! almost down to 80000!
what is going on here?
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:19:18
maybe someone can engineer a test for serial correlation for this data, to me it seems out of the roof how often a pool with a low hashrate scores 2 or more in a row. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:13:21
something like this is possible, though I thought fixed costs were quite significant, so I d think they would let the equipment run all day.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:30:20
I have glanced over it and it looks very unnormal to me. 
I studied econometrics so I somewhat know what I m talking about. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:26:58
I m willing to bet that this data does not fit randomness at all. I have seen these monster streaks quite often when I glanced over the data.
Most likely someone is reassigning large amount of hashpower from one pool to another quickly.

we need to fight every day to keep our status as DIGITAL GODL. It essential to always keep fighting for it, because the competition does not sleep!
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:14:35
I doubt it. So I scroll down and find btcc finding 3 in a row earlier today with an average hashrate of 4%
Chance of finding 3 in row, 1 in 15000.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:07:41
we need to focus on our role as digital GODL...
who needs economic activity LOL, that was all Jihad Wu spamming anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:10:49
that wld be a sneaky idea if they had actually credited the money and my bet was lost.
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:40:52
well halving from excessive block rewards might be good. but halving from already low rewards might do more harm than good. This one might still be ok, but I would not be too sure.
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:04:04
did you even read my post?
If I can buy a majority of the mining equipment cheaply, that cannot support a high market cap unless big stakeholders make sure this does not happen. might just as well switch to prove of stake then.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:56:09
proving my point somewhat, you could probably acquire a mining majority rather cheaply now.
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:18:19
yeah, but if market cap is suposed to be 100 billion, we cannot give miners a couple hundred grand per day. This would be a huge attack vector for short sellers.
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:36:19
that is not the point. The point is that if it is too cheap to acquire the mining majority, the network is unsafe. Imagine the hit to market cap when 51% attacked? Imagine the profits short sellers or double spenders might make?
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:55:01
so the mining reward is low and people buy these miners to mine for profit? The assumption I made was that in this case you do not have to bet much to make this unprofitable.  mining rewards will go lower and lower, at some point too low to generate meaningful economic rewards for mining.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:04:40
why would they buy mining equipment? You would not have to bid much to make buying for mining unprofitable if rewards are low.
