I don't think I said anything of that sort. I was merely puzzled why someone who thinks 'the dream of bitcoin is dead', is participating in a forum dedicated to said dream. I honestly am curious of what exactly what value you get out of publicly defaming something you yourself admit to owning and using.
As I mentioned




These two things are not the same.
Regardless, as I mentioned in another comment, the same shit was said about the internet, or really any disruptive technology. Honestly, I think the bitcoin dream would be more likely to be dead if there *weren't* people like you who get their rocks off by simply being contrarian.


As someone who has personal recollection of the early years of the internet where people like you spread misinformation, inevitably slowing the eventual ubiquitous adoption of the internet and the resulting explosion in innovation and technology and all the societal benefits that entailed, I would think such a mindless question would be obvious. But then again, if you had even the slightest understanding of what I'm talking about, you wouldn't be mindlessly posting drivel which ultimately serves the same purpose.

Yeah, I really don't understand this whole aversion to spending bitcoin. It's the entire goddamn point.
I buy bitcoin every chance I get and I spend bitcoin every chance I get. If every week I'm investing an amount similar to what I'm spending, the price volatility really doesn't matter to me.
The fact that multiple online vendors I shop with give discounts for using crypto is just a plus on top of the tech.
I honestly can't wait for most of these kids trying to get rich off of bitcoin either get burned and lose their money or just get tired and give up. I think only then will bitcoin begin to lose some of the volatility and develop it's primary use as a decentralized electronic form of cash.

Fractional Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve are mutually dependent. Each one relies entirely on the other to sustain the U.S. Dollar Ponzi scheme through the cycle of buying/selling treasury bonds.
Who do you think was most worried about banks going under during the Great Recession? "Too big to fail", was simply the Federal Reserve System protecting their investment.
They might as well be the same entity at this point.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:15:19
I could respond by saying how I have multiple businesses within walking distance of where I'm typing that accept bitcoin, or how multiple people I know who I don't consider at all technologically inclined have asked me about purchasing and using crypto-currency, or how I use bitcoin for normal purchases on a regular basis, or how I hear bitcoin and crypto-currency mentioned in news or media seemingly more every day. But all of that would be pointless anecdotal evidence that any logically-inclined adult wouldn't use as the sole basis for judging the ultimate fate of a technological concept. I would be even less likely to let that evidence motivate me enough to mindlessly troll forums devoted to that concept.

Your implication: they either work for free, or we force them to work without compensation. These are your words.
Regardless, the concept is that they are forced to work at a non-negotiated rate, not that they are forced to work for free. That's what government is, force. This is why doctor salaries are incredibly small in countries with UHC compared to their salaries in the U.S. (non-coincidentally, this is also why care in the U.S. is still seen as the most advanced in the world (note I said advanced care not access to care)).

Lol, thanks for the socialism 101 lesson but you could have saved yourself the time. We all understand how government works.


Why don't we do this for everything? Why don't we pool the county's entire production of beets into one government pool, and then distibute it out based on need. Really think about it.
And before you start to try to imagine some arbitrary distinction between medical services and other goods and services, don't. I'll give you a hint though, it's been tried before.


Congrats. You've used better logic than the vast majority of people.


I appreciate you trying to make up some distinction on the spot (I can tell this is your first time thinking about this) but there's no such thing as the morality of a "whole village". A village is just a concept. A village doesn't have self-awareness and an ability to make decisions based on "morality". Only individuals can do that.


Yes it is.


Once you answer the question above, you'll understand what the problem is.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:28:34
Agreed. And as I already explained, you can thank [this list of 11 major government regulations/market interventions]( for that fact.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:50:17
Lol, I'm about as far from being "out of my element" as one can be. I've been embarassing statists on healthcare for a couple decades bud. Go read my comments in this thread. Mayble you'll learn something.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:58:35
[Here's a good place to start if I didn't already link this](


That's a fair point that's often brought up. I would argue that since I'm arguing about the private market's healthcare and it was the government that didn't recognize the rights of blacks and women, that it's not relevant. At least not as relevant as if we were comparing aspects of the government.
I can even find you some arguments that since there were many of these "mutual-aid societies" that existed and the majority of them actually existed to help minorities due to government discrimination, that healthcare for minorities was actually better for then.


Also a fair point, but I again argue that this is only an issue when arguing for government-supported healthcare, since the funds come from a single source, the government. For private markets, an increase in population just results in an increase in demand and therefore an increase in supply. For instance, it is no harder to find access to groceries since the population has tripled, in fact I'd argue that it is easier.
Lastly, thank you for being open-minded to arguments that are new to here. Most of the time people see what they think is an argument they've seen before, they just assume I'm a republican arguing the typical shitty republican arguments and downvote and yell obscenities at me without actually considering what I'm saying (just look at this thread).

You know the U.S. has existed for centuries, right?
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:14:48


Yeah, I told you to not attempt to come up with arbitrary distinctions. Literally none of those things have any bearing on why it's not treated the same. There are plenty of things which are more important for the public's well-being, have more r&amp;d and funding requirements, and information asymmetry.


The principal-agent problem in medicine has to do with failure in insurance markets which are a result of government intervention as I've previously noted. With enough competition, insurance companies would be incentived to offer the best care to keep you healthy to decrease costs. This is how insurance used to function in the U.S., they would cover things like gyms, spas, preventative care, etc all to prevent more costly issues down the road.
Now that government funded insurance and healthcare is the majority of the industry (has been for a decade or two), they have created the principal-agent problem. Insurance companies are incentivized to increase costs and pay for extraneous shit with inflated prices, because it just results in more payout from the feds. You are literally arguing for the problem you think you're arguing against.
So again, you spent a lot of effort either typing things which are not relevant to the question or actually discredit your argument. I would ask the question again but I know you will just try to deflect.
The reason we don't socialize everything is because without calculation, economic activity is impossible. Since under Socialism economic calculation is impossible, under Socialism there can be no economic activity in our sense of the word … All economic change, therefore, would involve operations the value of which could neither be predicted beforehand nor ascertained after they had taken place. Everything would be a leap in the dark. Socialism is the renunciation of rational economy.
Socialization of industries like food has resulted in the mass starvation of millions of people. What you advocate literally kills people.
And you think *this* is the best way to run the healthcare industry.


I really don't care about your communist vs socialist debate you're having with yourself. It's pointless. It's semantics. Communism is supposed to be this imaginary post-scarcity stateless socialist society. Post-scarcity will never exist and you can't have socialism without a state, so it's literally impossible. Anytime you hear "communism" it means "socialism". They're interchangable. They're one in the same.
And yes, universal healthcare is socialism. Lol, I can't even believe this is an argument. Socialism fundamentally means government controlled industry. UHC = government controlled healthcare, so yes UHC = socialism. *facepalm*


Jesus Christ. Private property is literally your life. Without respect for private property literally mean without respect for your person and everything created by it.


What?? No it isn't although that is also a terrible idea. UHC is *government provided healthcare*, are you really this stupid?
And no. The math doesn't check out. There isn't a single country on the globe with UHC which doesn't run in the negative. Do I have to go into the concept of FIAT money for you?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:27:58


Holy shit could you make a bigger more fucked up assumption? Because he doesn't think supporting an immoral system based on force which will ultimately bankrupt a country resulting in misery and suffering, *he believes helping people is immoral*? How fucking twisted is that logic?


So caring about the morality of a system and whether or not it is going to be sustainable makes you "market obsessed" now? As a solar engineer and someone who opposes the immorality of government, I guess that makes me like the most 'market obsessed' person you've ever met, right?
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:38:27


Yes, without having to pay for police and fire fighters, municipal and state budgets would be greatly reduced. But knowing how governments function, they would likely just increase the budget elsewhere so they wouldn't have to decrease taxes.
But I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say here or why this is relevant.


Agree 100%, except for the fact that state and municpal budgets account for fire and police services. See above.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:25:39


This is mostly due to the inflation of medical care caused by the government interventions I previously cited, but I admit there will be the rare scenario where extra funding would be needed, this is where [mutual-aid societies]( that I previously mentioned come into play. Again, these were very prevalent prior to the government creating healthcare monopolies.


[Ehhh, this is a very prevalent misconception as well]( Honestly, aside from the civil rights and minority issues, industrial era labor practices (technology solved that problem) and the shitty technology, the gilded age was probably the most prosperous and opportunity-filled period in human history.

I can see that argument. Unfortunately, those problems were entirely brought about from the elimination of competition in the health insurance market due to various major government regulations. I can list the major ones if you want. Or you can just read my other comments.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:44:50
Well if you look at insurance costs in the early 1900's you see that catastrophic insurance was drastically cheaper (adjusted for inflation), even when you account for increased cost due to new tech (which is actually quite small, most of the inflation just comes from the way the system has been restructured).
Also, before full coverage, there was a concept called [mutual-aid societies]( which were incredibly prevalent and filled all the gaps.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:35:10


If you need to count it to help you remember, yes that sounds about right.


Nope. But that always seems to be people's reaction whenever someone goes against the hivemind on this topic. Source: see downvotes.


Yes, I know.


Not sure your point. Are we not supposed to look at history older than a couple decades for knowledge on how to function today? Hmmm, I think the world would be a pretty fucked up place if that were true.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:17:46
Updoot for using basic logic (and incoming downdoots).
And just one correction.


Competition of reasonable private insurance policy for 'catastrophic' care only would work fine. You know, like it did perfectly well before all the legislation and regulation that inflated market prices, reduced competition, and incentivized full coverage.
Edit: I love how people just downvote because they disagree with me. There's no better clue that your position is illogical if you downvote just because you disagree.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:26:23


Uhhh no. Do you think they do?

Again, you just don't know what you're talking about. As I've pointed out multiple times, the system of about a century ago was both the most financially efficient system and was the time when community support and the existence of mutual-aid societies was the highest there has ever been in history. Saying that was cruel is just plain stupid.


I agree. So I don't know what your issue with me is. I just disagree on how.

Bitcoin will never function as a currency. It's too slow and fees are too high. Those in control have shown they will keep it that way.
It was designed to function as a currency, not an ETF. There's no logical reason that it would function as an ETF besides pure speculation. Yet the majority of that speculation is based on the idea that it will eventually become a currency. Kind of a self-defeating prophecy.
Much more likely that something like bch, nano, ltc, xmr, etc will eventually overtake btc. But there will be a lot of carnage before that.

Interesting ideas! I wonder if price controls and subsidies have any historical examples which have proven them, as basic economics suggest, to be absolutely horrible policies?

How exactly do you expect this to happen? I'm sorry to break it to you, but humans are not and never will be 100% altruistic. Unless you plan on re-implementing some sort of slavery (which to an extent is fundamentally what some more socialist nations are actually doing), 10 million dollar goods and services aren't just going to magically become free.
But all of this fails to understand the actual root causes of inflation and exclusive costs in healthcare anyway.
Edit: Just for shits and giggles, what, if any price actually IS reasonable to save one's life? How about to provide one with shelter? Food? Do you think you would be able to assign prices to each of these things for say a small nation's economy?

Don't feed the trolls folks.

That's the entire point of mining....

Ehh, no one really knows what the price will end up being. Just like you couldn't have predicted that the 2018 dollar would buy you 1/600oz of gold (or whatever the price is these days) in 1776.

And you come off ass a white knighting neck beard.
Who gives a fuck.

Anyone who believe the dollar is always going to be around is a god damn moron.


I don't think anyone would argue otherwise.

Makes it that much more sad that you don't understand it.


I don't think you know what that word means.


Who said anything about the meme being funny?
You're a child.

Are you really shaming someone for not being wealthy? What're you from the nineteen twenties? Grow the fuck up.

If you sell all your Bitcoin at a specific price, when the price rises above that point you lost all that Bitcoin for no profit. Either you buy back in at a loss or go play somewhere else.

Less profitable mining = less mining = less supply = higher price.
It's literally the most basic principle of economics.

Haha, no need to apologize man. It might be the case that I'm using wallets that are a little extra user-friendly just because I've tended to only use wallets that have a large user base already established.
My two main wallets (blockchain and exodus) have that feature built in (value in USD or whatever currency you select next your balance). And my main Exchange (Gemini) has always had the same feature.
I can see if you were maybe an early adopter and are still using some of the first apps, they might not have that feature built in.

Who are you to tell the state what it can/cannot do?
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:37:54
Of course you're an 'economist'. The only people that would say some circular nonsense like "the value of this dollar is backed up by the fact that this dollar is used as value" and then say "yeah, let's make this the fundamental backbone of a global economy".
I mean come on. Don't they teach you better in economy school? You would think you guys would have a better justification for the global ponzi scheme that is the federal reserve and its fractional reserve banking by now. I mean, it's not like economists have other things to do.

Could you please direct me to the nearest GDP-exchange? I'd like to trade in my pieces of paper for some of that sweet domestic product.

Makes perfect sense.

I just had a big dinner. If you handed me a big mac right now, I'd probably throw it in the trash....
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:25:19
Yeah, 50 years of unsustainable growth leading to inevitable crash and burn?
Eventually the national debt will reach such a staggeringly stupid level that someone (likely China) might start to think they're not going to turn out on the good side of this ponzi scheme. And then it all comes crashing down.

You must not have much of an imagination.
Some people predict reaching the singularity within a century. Some say decades. Why would a super-intelligent AI occupying the entire internet value food and water?
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:27:25
How do you not see the circular reasoning in that?
The value of this thing is backed up by the fact that this thing is used as value?
I've heard a lot of ridiculous reasoning from FIAT fanboys but this one takes the cake.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:24:34
lol imagine using the word cucked unironically.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:02:51
The only possible way for it to be sustainable would be with negative interest rates like you mention. But that would mean instead of the wealth being siphoned off of the entire nation for the benefit of the bankers, the bankers would be the ones losing wealth. Which would never happen.
Hyper-inflation is the guaranteed outcome. It's just a matter of when. The longer it is sustained, the more wealth is misallocated, meaning the worse the ultimate crash will be.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:51:27
Jesus, I must of have touched a nerve with the FIAT fanboys.


Oh, okay. I'm just going to assume that you have no fucking clue what you're talking about sense you felt the need to parrot some talking point you've heard without any reasoning or argument behind it.
What the fuck do you think happens when your creditor loses confidence that you will be able to repay them and then refuse to loan you more money? It's literally exactly the same as a personal debt, just on a national or global scale.
[I mean the exactly what I fucking described has played out multiple times in our lifetimes,]( and you people still bury your fucking heads in the sand.
I can't believe I have to fucking explain this in a crypto-currency sub.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:11:55
Lots of great talking points here. Looks like you paid attention in your mandatory FIAT re-education classes.
It's all still meaningless nonsense that could be boiled down to the same circular bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:07:04
You've copy and pasted a lot of text considering there is nothing of meaning in your entire comment. Other than some cliche talking points that have no relevance whatsoever.


Took the words out of my mouth.

Of course. Anything negative about bitcoin in the bitcoin sub must inherently be pro-bcash. You people have fucking lost it.

Lol, BTC is not fast.
