Good to know there is still strong sentiment for BTC. I won’t be adding to my stack but will continue to HODL strong.

Right? I'm fully expecting a ban soon...

Just bought some REQ as well. BTC... well, I’ve been with it since early 2011 and I don’t see myself adding a thing to my BTC stack anytime in the future. 
I’m going to HODL but I’m not very optimistic about BTC’s future.

Lets put it this way, BTC has, for the past two years at least, rested on it's laurels from a tech perspective. It's barely usable in it's current state, mining is highly concentrated in China and increasingly more expensive and difficult to keep up with, and the market is full of innovators. 
Yes, 90% of the competitors are shitcoins and don't deserve a second glance, but there are plenty of coins that are superior to BTC in every way from a tech perspective. 
I love BTC, I've been with her for a long time, that said, I won't be contributing any additional fiat. This isn't 2014 or earlier, BTC's price has to be justifiable and at this point I'm worried it's simply not.

Pretty sure that doesn't work with 2016.

The butthurt over BCH makes no sense. I don’t see the same kind of sentiment with other forks like ETH/ETC.   
BCH will likely die a slow death. If core gets their act together and BTC gets some significant development BTC holders (I’ve been in the game since 2011) have nothing to worry about.
