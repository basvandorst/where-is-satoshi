I use bitcurex to directly wire money into polish accounts with almost NO fees and 24hr to deposit. Just create a new account with your Grandmas name and punch in her bank account for the withdrawl. Next simply send bitcoins, sell for PLN and withdraw. You do get hit with a 0.5% transaction fee but that is standard for trading. Hope this helps

Actually, they can be anonymous. You can deposit money(cash) into MTGOX from a chase/bankofamerica all without using your real name or id via bitinstant.
@_date: 2012-04-18 22:22:01
I'm guessing you are in the US, if so here is easiest way:
Open mtgox account
go to bitinstant.com
fill out form and pick a local bank (BofA or other)
go to bank with cash and form
go home and refresh your mtgox account, cash should arrive in &lt;1hr
buy bitcoins
This has a bit of fees but it can be done in &lt;1hr from scratch and you can do it without giving up your name :)
There is another website that offers this same thing and i think it has lower fees, im probably gonna try it next time and see how it goes. It has a big X in its name with dark background, will edit if i find it.
i just looked at bitinstant and they have 1000$ limit so you should be covered, if not make more accounts and deposit in multiples of 1000 during same visit

The client isn't really installed. As long as you have wallet.dat in correct place just open up new version. If you have trouble, delete bitcoin folder in %appdata% and the client folder. Open/close new client. replace wallet.dat and open client to start downloading the blockchain from scratch.
@_date: 2012-04-18 23:27:39
You got a downvote cause you supplied the worst possible information, just to advertise. This is only good for 3 countries, or more specifically Denmark. Excuse me for reading OP and seeing USD and thinking he is in US. Either way, I read OP and your comment and knew instantly how piss poor your advise was. And I think that you knew as well that he most likely is not in one of those 3 countries and spammed your website anyway instead of trying to help some1 who is new.

that is an expensive motherboard, you can get a cheap one with 2 x PCI1x and get 4 dollar risers on amazon. I don't think its worth 100 dollars more to have a package like that. that's 1 months worth of mining just for the luxury of cleanness.
@_date: 2012-02-14 05:42:55
Is this the cause of the price drop ?? :(

If he was in Europe and was able to use bank transfer, he wouldn't be asking. Using bank transfer in Europe gives you so many options to buy bitcoins that your website would not be the most attractive offer anyway.

There have been a lot of reputable members of bitcointalk.org that have run into issues with "Goat". He has been called out on a lot of things and that's usually when things got hostile. I don't see what harm he is causing. It's not like pool hopping is illegal. It's a known fact that prop pools can be hopped and its your fault if you are mining on a pool that isn't hop proof. What is this cancer they speak of?
@_date: 2012-04-17 07:18:25
Colsatre is right, there is almost no bandwidth going accross the pcie port. Its just small math calculations rather than 3d models. I run half my cards from pcie 1x and it doesnt change a thing.

My point was that there is no difference between running the cards at 60c or 70c or even 90c. And if your downclocking your core clock by half, you should just quit mining. Do some research in the field, im confident that playing highend 3d games puts a bigger stress on the cards than mining 24/7. "stress" on silicon chips is rapid heat cycles, which happens more during gaming than mining. I was tearing out my hair reading the OP, it's like saying cleaning your rims will make your car last longer.
@_date: 2012-03-05 07:31:55
If you are in the US, go to bitinstant.com and fill out a form to deposit into your mtgox account. Next go to nearest Bank of America or Chase and hand them deposit slip plus cash. Wait one hour and your cash is on mtgox. If you start from scratch you can create a mtgox account and deposit and buy bitcoins in &lt;1.5hours. Good luck
@_date: 2012-02-26 08:29:56
Your whole thought process is wrong!!! Running your cards at 100% does not "burn" out your GPU. You want your engine clock as high as possible without pushing the voltage. You cannot mess up your card unless you are pushing high voltage. If your card can't handle it, it will crash display driver for 30 sec and be back up, no harm done. I don't know where you got your false information on cooler = longer life. As long as it's in a safe temperature, there is nothing wrong. 85c is cold for AMD cards. Run BF3 on stock settings and the card will push 100c by design.
@_date: 2012-02-25 08:26:35
Why would mining reduce the lifetime of the card? Just cause it's being used in what you think is a stressful way means nothing. If you want to talk technicalities, playing any game will make your gpu usage/temps all over the place. Which will cause more of a "stress" than mining and keeping a constant temp. The only thing mining can do is wear out the fan faster which is a cheap fix. So, if you can get a cheap card from a miner, by all means go for it.
@_date: 2012-05-02 23:31:08
I think if the price of bitcoin goes 30+ then a lot of people will cash out because they were hording 10k coins this whole time. So i think we will have another big drop after the initial spike. I do think that the drop will be far less severe and maybe level out at 10-20 range. I think it would take a really big event to drive the demand with such consistency that the hoarders cashing out wouldn't effect the price much.
@_date: 2012-03-02 09:17:20
Time to SELL SELL SELL, lol. any1 else thing this is gonna negatively impact the price?

You can get bitcoins for cash via bitinstant or aurumxchange and mtgox. Best part is you never have to use a real name :) sure the fee is 3-5% but it works in an hour

@_date: 2012-03-02 19:33:34
IDK what your are talking about. Maybe if you were doing it with one account consistently with lots of volume. I have used MTGOX since MAY and never verified with any ID or anything of that nature. I have probably bought around $2k worth of bitcoins.
from my experience once you have a GOX account you can deposit cash and buy bitcoins and withdraw in 1hour15min. Will they auto freeze accounts like that? 
@_date: 2012-02-11 07:46:27
1. Depends on what Amd card you have
2. IDK about bitclockers, but mtred has 0 fees so its hard to beat.
3. cgminer, way better
4. you can prob OC your card a lot more and get more mhash
@_date: 2012-09-10 03:35:07
It's for paranoid people who are worried that their ip will be traced from the transaction. Since bitcoins have a trace of all transactions, some people want to trade their bitcoins for different bitcoins to cut the transaction chain.
@_date: 2012-01-28 22:42:04
Mining will always follow price. If new tech comes out that mines 10x what 5830's can for the same power/cost, then the difficulty will go up and people with 5830's will sell their cards/rigs. Just look at what happened to cpu mining, its non existent, either switch from cpu to gpu or go home. Same thing will happen if new tech comes out that blows AMD HD 5,6,7 series out of the water. Coins would be produced at a higher rate for a few days to a week, but it wouldnt be significant. 
Rule of thumb, If price goes up &gt; mining is more profitable, more people mine, difficulty goes up, mining profitability stabilizes 
If price goes down &gt; mining is less profitable, people turn off miners, difficulty goes down, mining profit back to normal.

Well if he can fit 7 cards on 1 pc, and he used 6970's, that would be ~2kw of power required. divide that by 3 and you get 3x700w power supplies

If you are looking for cheap, then the cheapest way is through Dwolla. Fee is like 25cents and then mtgox which is &lt;1%. the only problem is you have to first link up a bank account and that takes time. Then it takes a few days to transfer money from bank to dwolla. Dwolla&gt;mtgox is close to instant.
looks like 2.99% which is getting better

It looks like Dwolla is going down the shitter, they started requiring an absurd amount of personal info and other blockades to Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2012-04-18 22:42:25
There is over 1gb of blockchain i believe
each block is therefor only scanned once(to save time) to see if your addresses sent/received bitcoins and updates your total.
if you switch wallets, the client will not know the balance of bitcoins and needs to -rescan the blockchain to figure it out.
-rescan does not redownload the blockchain or alter the wallet.dat file.
also, if you are worried about corruption or something happening to your wallet.dat, you should have multiple backups of the wallet.dat file.

BULL SHIT, tax id, address, etc. For this type of service i don't think its necessary to give them all the info. I can print off my own QR code and laminate it. I thought this would be a cool simple service to get a keychain QR code with sms verification. They can shove it with the required info. The most i'm willing to to give them is a damn email address. 
I never even had to give a tax id to accept VISA/MC/AMEX through square.

Yea a MSI or ASrock for 70-100 is better i agree. Most people use win 7 x64 for mining and for a dollar more, the OS will run a bit more smoothly. I think a dollar in this category is worth it.

I really don't see why people have trouble with buying bitcoins in USA. You have a checking account right?? Set up dwolla, link your bank, and you are done. It takes a few days to transfer from bank to dwolla but that's normal for those type of money links. Just do it, once you set it up it's really easy to buy from mtgox. I never had to do any weird verifications, just the standard tiny deposit verification for bank&gt;dwolla.
