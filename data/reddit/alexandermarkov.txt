There is no nigh fee attack. Just lots of users trying to use non-scalable payment system.
There is no coordinated bitcoin dump. Just a long squeeze.

2 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto:
1. Buy.
2. Wait for 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:53:41
It collapses every three years or even more often. Anyone who has no patience may kill themselves whatever time they want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:35:14
If this shitcoin get as popular as bitcoin it will have $5 transaction fee instead of $40. That's 8 times better.
And there are no spammers, you paranoid /bitcoin freak. Right now 250 BTC worth of transaction fees are pending. What kind of spammer spends hundreds of BTC to slow down the network?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:25
The last time (Nov 10) there was a choked mempool.
But I think we're fucked this time anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:08:33
Who are all those people you talking about every day on this subreddit?
I can't see any of them here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:42:39
I'm pretty sure this simple algorithm still works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:13:54
It's a very good time to talk about PEER TO PEER NETWORK when transaction fee skyrocket to $50.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:40
How the hell should I sell it to you while the network isn't working? The mempool contains 300 BTC worth of transactions already.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:49:39
Finally the proper guide.

Russian guy here. €500 is not bad. And you're living in a warm country where you don't need to heat your house and wear 4 kilograms of clothes for 8 months every year. I see people every day surviving in a much more harder conditions than yours. Fix your goddamn anxiety.

You could run another iteration in parallel any time you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:51:01
OK. I am a spammer. Trying to use bitcoin network with $40 fee equals spamming.
And I believe transaction fees are skyrocketing exponentialy. So with the Roger's shitcoin there will be not $5, but much more less.

Every quote is 100% genuine. Read the  to be sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:04:00
Oh, thank you! I didn't noticed that I run an attack by complaining about $40 transaction fees: 
Roger is a clown, but his shitcoin at least works right now.

Correction: 12.5 BTC as a block reward.

By the way, this guy —  — needs an upgrade. He's also using some of my statistic data.
@_date: 2014-06-28 11:51:55
You can see a lot of historical charts about mining cost here: 
@_date: 2014-06-28 12:05:49
But if fact, mining cost makes no sense since 2013. Buying an ASIC is not a buying a "money printer", it's a kind of speculation in hope you'll mine more bitcoins then you pay for the miner. Why? Because of one unobvious thing: you can mine only finite count of bitcoins with your ASIC miner. You can read more detailed explanation here: 
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:28:32
And you can help that guy:


Just press "news" there.

I own this website: 
I collect statistics, draw charts and realize other ideas coming in my head. All the sources are open here: 
I'm currently running on $5 digitalocean instance with other websites, and thanks to my skilled hands, I don't need an upgrade at all. :)
But sometimes I need some help.
For example, some time ago bitcoin block explorer stopped to export blocks-difficulty data,  so my friend who running an old PC at home gives me an SSH account so I could run bitcoind with 23G of blockchain (my $5 digitalocean instance has only 20G of disk space) and produce difficulty data by myself.
Or just yesterday Bitfinex team set JS-based Web3.99 shit-tastic SaaS DoS-protection on  So now I have to run firefox (!) on my VPS just to download single HTML page.
Yes, I read the rules, but I don't like this game. I just will be very happy if you'll help me with other problems which could happen in future. My email is apsheronets you could send me your contacts and I'll ask you if I need something.
@_date: 2016-03-17 11:45:13
I think you don't realize how bad the situation really is. Take a look at thread nearby: 
Users already have to use VPS to run their nodes. Why running them on a huge secure datacenter would be a worse solution?
@_date: 2016-03-19 13:22:46
Buttcoiners have nothing to do with United Bitcoin. We actually have been inspired by [Bitcoin XT]( [Bitcoin Classic]( (classic???) and [Bitcoin Unlimited]( The funny part is: every project has its own interpretation of the Holy PDF by Satoshi. And then my friend tell me: "hey, lets write a text full of Sathoshi's quotes explaining why we should deliver Bitcoin to the central bank and ~~Hitler~~ Putin".
I actually don't want to increase block size. I have no reason except the one: all those classic/xt/unlimited forkers are clowns.
@_date: 2016-03-19 20:26:30
Bitcoin mafia, huh.
Look, this will not work in a country like Venezuela.
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:44:00
Moreover: **OOOPay is a scam**.
Read some reviews here (in Russian): 
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:30:03
Core developers are using IRC, classic developers are using Slack. That's all I need to know to choose a wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:03:08
I can't imagine any reason why it should be saved as PDF.
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:26:04
You could never know for sure. Today's satire is tomorrow's reality. But we believe in United Bitcoin as a competitor to BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and other so-called "projects to follow Satoshi's original vision".
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:40:38
It's not a trick, it's just another interpretation of the sacred text. People do it all the time, and who are you to stop us?
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:36:52


**Bullshit.** It's the first time I ever heard about it.

Using IDE? Are you serious?
@_date: 2016-03-19 16:08:36
The difference is I'm only joking, but those clowns are going to break the only thing in the whole bitcoin ecosystem that actually works fine: the bitcoin client itself.

JESUS CHRIST
For the first time in my life I'm glad I live in Russia.
In a country where Bitcoin is officially banned and where you are facing years of jail just for using it.
In a country where there are plenty of traders who'll meet you in any place in town and trade you bitcoins for 3% fee with $100 000 limit.
You have no idea what counter-economics really is you bunch of sissy boys.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:13:27
 will never go down!
@_date: 2016-03-19 10:07:08
It's totally clear that average user just can't run a full bitcoin node.

Localbitcoins is blocked in Russia, yep, I confirm.
There will be no gully on volume chart. In Russia, they release funny laws every week. And nobody gives a shit. Nobody is even paying taxes. Bitcoin ban, localbitcoins blocking, who cares. RUR volumes are already at $500k/day and rising. It's already a half of USD volumes. And you better to take a page.
@_date: 2016-09-25 11:41:04
No. Just use localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:33:33
Logically you can attach data on paper sheet, and since it's attached to a wall so of course can read data from it.
My question is, would it be possible to host a webpage on paper sheet? any chance?
@_date: 2016-05-27 17:58:25
That's a brilliant scam.

You know, in soviet Russia we just use peer-to-peer exchange and don't give a shit about selfies. Stop using crappy services and introduce yourself a little anarchy.
