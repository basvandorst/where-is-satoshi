I bet some of you will scream 'to the moon!' again when btc goes up again next time. Fact is: party is over in 2018. We're in a long term downward trend and the end/bottom is bearly visible, even if you use your binoculars to try to catch it. The moment suicide hotlines are set in place, is the moment you need to invest in btc. People need to die first, jump off the golden gate bridge, before you're able to get your lambo.

you must be a fool to think btc will go up to previous height like in december. Average joes are all gone. Where do you think new money has to come from? It's not that bitcoin is dying, there are just too many people already in it. Most of these people are positive about btc and crypto, but no new money is coming in cause average joe is not going to get his ass burned twice. Conclusion: btc will go down under 1000. No new money means price won't rise (enough), which means people will lose their patience and sell, bringing down more and more holders with them.

It's going to take MONTHS or even YEARS to go back to ATH. People can't immagine how much new money was put in at ath and how much hype you need to get back to ath. This hype won't come back cause hypes only come once. So you need organic growth, which takes months/years.

Traders, non-traders, holders, nocoiners, you're all going to lose. This is the end.
