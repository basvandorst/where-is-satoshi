Lighning Network should solve scalability. This means less transactions on the first level, so fees will go down. The total money spent on energy for mining will tend towards the total fees (incl mining profits), so once fees go down energy consumption will go down as well. 
The uncertainty is currently attacks against Lightning Network. In particular various classes of DOS attacks have been studied insufficiently.

Yes we did, but it was for the greater good.

Please note that this message has been signed by a different key from the one Andreas used here: 
The key used in the donation request is registered on the  key server with Andreas' address, and I verified that the signature validates, but the fact that the key exists on the key server does not proof that Andreas owns the corresponding private key.
Please be careful.

There is no such things as NSA constants.

No, it does not.
The whitepaper is written in LaTeX (the layout language used by almost everyone in the exact sciences). LaTeX lets the user focus on content, and takes care of layout itself. The wider space after full stops is something that happens without the users involvement, the user does not actually type a double space.
It is highly unlikely that the statement was written in LaTeX as well. The statement is inconsistent in the use of curly and straight apostrophes in "Newsweek's". That's a mistake nearly impossible to make in LaTeX (LaTeX can be set to either make all apostrophes round, or none of them), and is consistent with the use of Word, which makes the apostrophes round, but only if you type a space after the word, and not if you insert an apostrophe without further editing in that part of the text. In addition, the statement uses a font which seems to be Times New Roman, while the standard font of LaTeX is Computer Modern. LaTeX and Computer Modern are tightly connected, so it is very uncommon for LaTeX users, and not that trivial, to use any other font.

In this case it is, see the second item [here](

Can confirm.

~~We cannot verify that the key that cross-signed is the key that he used to sign the article on Coinbase.~~
~~&gt; gpg: Signature made Wed 26 Feb 2014 04:53:21 GMT using RSA key ID 2878DE4F~~
~~&gt; gpg: BAD signature from "Andreas M. Antonopoulos &lt;andreas
~~This is likely a technical issue. It might be caused by layout changes after applying the signature, for example. If others can also not verify the signature on the Coinbase report, perhaps could publish a plain-text or base64-encoded version of the Coinbase report.~~
Edit: see below, it verifies now.

Thank you, we don't get to hear that often these days. If you are American, please think of us at the next elections!

I can confirm that this is not an operation carried out by the NSA.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:41:22
No, Dorian never had contact with the NSA.

We did. The pgp signature is valid. However, our unit has currently no evidence that the private key belongs to him, and on  Andreas used a different key pair.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:23:44
I'm glad that I have taken away your worries.
Just to be sure, I was only referring to the protocol itself. Exchanges and other services were the user has no control over its own bitcoin offer no form of security or protection against any party, including foreign government actors.

We responded to this issue here:
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:08:47
~~I still get 'BAD signature' on the pastebin text.~~
Found the problem, I was using a different encoding for the curly quotes. It verifies now.
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:54:36
Nope, 16. The name reddit is written with a lowercase r.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:33:29
~~Thank you, I missed that.~~
~~The signature on the Coinbase review does not verify for me though. This might be an issue with the webserver changing the layout after signing, or even an issue with our internal proxy.~~
~~Does the signature on the Coinbase review verify for others?~~
Edit: I was using the wrong encoding for the curly quotes, it verifies now.

The bitcoin protocol itself does not currently contain any backdoors that can be exploited by us or any other federal agency.
