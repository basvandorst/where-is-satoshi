Nice story, was an interesting read.   I like hearing people's personal stories and rise back up from tough spots..

I'm not saying I agree or that it's true... but it's a good thing to have an open mind.

Why do they expect criminal groups and rogue nation states to print fake cash?

That's really nice, if the new students will start to adopt bitcoins then the word will spread in no time.

Great news? Isnt this exactly what bitcoin is supposed to not be?  Huh This is not good news. Fuck the fame, we want anonymity

Because it is Bitcoins and there is no other crypto as good as it. =)

Invest it in a Bitcoin related business or start my own Bitcoin business with the money.

Didn't know that Switchless launched its solutions on this issue

answer to topic question:
someone or more then one in every country is using bitcoin, but the ISIS bitcoin propaganda only began by words of a single blogger writing a paragraph on a website. not provable words or speeches of a militia

Toronto, Canada anyone? We have a ton of stores, and we have lots of bitcoin atms. Vancouver may also be good, but Toronto is a bigger city.

Why do you find Bitcoin the first mover in the market?
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:43:26

Great site! Everething is so clear

It was very useful to read it, if you know the rules which bitcoin uses it's much more easier to use it.

This would result in Argentinians benefiting, not the government.
The government usually has its best interest at heart while taking decisions.

I wonder how much a store is paid to place bitcoin ATM there? it could be very interesting experience for other business as well

Buffett is genius, if he tells that to invest in btc is better than it's really so. But why doesn't he trust into Apple or Google?

It's not really the "general public"... it's a few select students at a couple of universities. That being said, another small step forward for bitcoin.
