more like a fucking tool. Have you seen the performance of crypto recently?

I'll take your worthless dollars. PM me for paypal email. 
The great thing about "fiat" is that it is backed by the economy and the taxing power of the issuing country. As long as the people in the US are making goods and selling services, USD will have value to purchase those. What's bitcoin backed by?

OK, we're on the same page now. Agree that cash is a non productive asset. 
I just don't like it when some bitcoin promoters attack on "fiat" currency as it was some imaginary thing that has no intrinsic value on its own.

Can block chains feed me or provide me shelter?

Why would central banks adopt bitcoin when it would mean loss of control over their monetary policy? 
Ask Greece how great it is to have the Euro and to have no say over their own monetary policy... LMAO.

Got news got you. All your stocks, bonds, and properties are denominated and valued in USD, a "fiat" currency. It represents pretty much the majority of your net worth.

It's a lot more stable and works efficiently than a cryptocurrency.

LOL. There are lots of jews in the list of the biggest holders of bitcoin. Made them billionaires out of nothing, in fact.

And someone else may use bitcoin for buying drugs, or using it for money laundering purposes, that acts of which devalue the currency and decrease the value of your own holdings. Same thing.

Why does everyone in the world need to know about a small online purchase I made? Seems inefficient and waste of energy.
How much electricity would be required to process and record all the Visa credit card transactions in the US through a block chain? Last time I heard, it required more nuclear power plants than exists in the world...

Wait, what's wrong with the old system?

Backed by the economy and the taxing power of the issuing country. As long as you can buy the goods and services produced in the United States with USD, USD will have intrinsic value...
