"doesn't have a totally unsustainable business model"
I can't tell if you're trying to criticize or be sarcastic or what, but this means that their business model is sustainable.

Says the person trying to build the "everything to every user" cryptocurrency.
Edit: for those not aware, is the founder of Ethereum, which with its Turing-complete transaction scripts is a project that constitutes the exact opposite of modularity.

Coinbase's instant limits are actually higher.

More people have bank accounts than have credit cards, which means they can already use Coinbase, so you're wrong.

The screenshot is not actually a screenshot of the coinbase checkout page, which does let you do that.

Not really sure what you expect. Support are not engineers, that seems like a completely reasonable response.

No you weren't, you explicitly said he should pay them money, which is an entirely different point and doesn't make that implication.

Why is this even news? We already know that Twitch accepts bitcoin, that seems to be what's important.
I have strong doubts that the regular community would upvote this that much... it only serves to divide us by promoting brand loyalties.

You might get some downvotes, I think it's the sad truth. We actually have to wait for the older generations to die before there are enough people accepting of the technology because they grew up with it. The people best fit to govern technology are those who grew up with it and understand it. The worst people to make these kinds of decisions are those who don't understand it: old people. Unfortunately they'll have the majority of the vote for a while, and their opinions probably won't change til they're dead.

You're changing the point from "it has no value because merchants don't accept it" (which doesn't make sense re: my post above) to "bitcoin doesn't have value because it's a ponzi scheme." Which is it?
The ponzi scheme myth is [debunked here]( But if you insist that's what it is regardless, I can't help you.

It is not as difficult as you make it sound to detect malfeasance. You do not need to unfold the logic of each line of their javascript and understand what it's doing to make sure there isn't any. You just observe the network transactions for any data leakage. Much simpler.

Ah yes, that must be why the US government sold their bitcoin to the public through a public auction.

There is a difference between worry and wanting to know.

This argument doesn't make sense because bitcoin started under these conditions. In fact, it started at zero, both price-wise and merchant-adoption-wise. It is strictly more valuable and more widely adopted than then. If your point held any water, bitcoin never should have had any price in the first place.

This is a good argument against replacing the judicial branch (supreme court), not the legislative branch (congress).

Occam's razor would tell us that this is probably used for compliance and fraud prevention.
Coinbase has said on every possible occasion that you are not anonymous there. If anonymity is your goal, not sure why you're using them in the first place.
You're already linking up your bank account and in many cases telling them your full identity anyway, so in that light this doesn't even seem interesting.

Purchases take 4 business days to deliver. What you're seeing is the user receiving 1 btc from a purchase initiated 4 business days ago, and also the user initiating a separate purchase for 10 btc on the same day. Photoshop not required, seems perfectly normal.

But I mean does anyone even have a *screenshot*? As far as I've been able to ascertain, they have licenses but no real working product.

Nobody has forgotten Bitpay, they have their own stories here like every other week because they earn it. The exchange news is simply not relevant to them. What are you afraid of?

Some columns are good things, some columns are bad things. So when a row is full of green checkmarks, that's very misleading - it makes it seem like the ideal pegged coin, when in reality it has flaws. The ideal pegged coin would have "1:1 dollar backed" checked and every other of those columns X'd out.

Coinbase doesn't require a photo ID or paper evidence, just your basic information and a 3rd party question set to verify your ID.

Or double if you compare it to the exchange.
