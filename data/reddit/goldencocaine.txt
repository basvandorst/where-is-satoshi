Same, well at least according to the law I am "unemployed". Welcome to the club &amp; congratulations
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:49:44
Honestly I'd go knock on their door or contact a lawyer

It asks for a transaction ID, how do I get my transaction ID? what even is that? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:23:21
Oh ok thank you so much. So once I put it in that website, it just accelerates it and i dont have to do anything else?

i envy the shit outa you
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:47:48
Yea, I assume so too just a little anxious as it was a large transaction... 
Next I'm wondering if Gemini is going to end up crediting users the BCC or not 
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:28:56
Without people like you, others wouldn't profit. So thank you for your work sir

It eventually got sent back to me. So I did receive my money back eventually. I write about the process of solving the problem in this thread:
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:36:50
Yeah no problem man. It will definitely get all sorted out so don't sweat it too much. I had to reply, I just remembered how much this stressed me out at the time haha
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:47:14
Enter your transaction ID. Wait an hour or so. Solves issue
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:06:00
Impossible to know. But since your asking on a bitcoin forum.... I'd definitely put my chips on bitcoin. Higher risk probably but muchhhh higher return potential  
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:57:35
I need my money sooner rather than later... any advice on where to get a lawyer in this type of business? I can't afford to sit around and wait for my money to hopefully 'reappear'
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:16:32
Bank of America. I'm in CA, so it was a domestic wire transfer. I've contacted my bank and got the Fed reference tracing number. Thing is Gemini hasn't responded to me at all via Facebook, support tickets, phone number, emails, etc... any ideas on how else to get ahold of them?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:14:10
This is so ignorant from so many different angles... but I'm just going to address the Runescape related one. It is in no way damaging the game or the games economy
RS has always been full of gold farmers, and will continue to be full of them. Most of the Venezuelans aren't even using bots. Before Venezuela experienced turmoil, green dragons have always been full of people and bots. They are being farmed just as heavily as before. Just now it's predominately Venezuelans. It's not like suddenly there is a huge surplus of dragon bones because of Venezuela, you have to be kidding me lol
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:46:25
Amazed you found my post. Saw this post on another persons thread and I've already filed a complaint at dfs.ny.gov
Other can trying to contact Gemini over and over, what are the chances you think I receive my money? It was the vast majority of my entire savings account.... i'm very concerned 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:31:27
Do they have their own separate coin? Or is this just being integrated using Bitcoin? And do you really think this can pose a threat to Ethereum which is already very well established with a great dev team?
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:29:58
The million dollar question.
Nobody can know this.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:56:38
Just think about how you'll feel in a few years when you see the price is 5000+
Smart BTC investors are here for the long-run. I'm holding long term no matter what happens tomorrow
@_date: 2016-05-17 07:14:07
How do I empty my wallet? I already basically emptied my wallet with this transaction, sent basically all the BTC I own. And now it just sits there pending forever
It doesn't let me send more because I have no funds available 
@_date: 2016-05-17 07:27:27
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:39:39
You should honestly just spread out your investments in crypto and hold ALL of them long term.
You should buy some ether, ripple, and btc. And hold onto all of them LONGER term. Do not trade them if they rise, or dip. It's a market, shits gunna happen. But in the long run, I'm betting bullish on all of these cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:15:04
I love Bitcoin &amp; and will ALWAYS support it. But to say something like "goodbye Ethereum" just because a company got some funding is absolutely absurd.... Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin are totally different and in my opinion can co-exist just fine. They offer different services. I'm not sure why people don't seem to like Ethereum around r/bitcoin. Both have their places in the crypto world, and don't take anything from the other. Why not invest in both...
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:15:10
Lolwut? This has to be the most ignorant comment I've read on this sub 
Do some research then come back please, it's clear you don't understand Ethereum very well, or what it's trying to do
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:14:14
Lol the second it "crashes" I'm buying even more... and holding long term. 
So, please... be my guest, CRASHHHH!!!
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:21:47
Ok so yes, BIP is going to lock in soon
But when does Segwit actually activate and Bitcoin is officially using it? November? August?
@_date: 2016-05-17 07:48:42
I actually noticed this today. I sent some funds with a fee today, and this time it asked for a fee. Yesterday when I tried to send my 3 BTC, it never asked for a fee! It just flat out sent, I have absolutely no idea what is going on. The servers seemed to be experiencing some sort of issues at the time because they kept disconnecting and re-synching and getting stuck
Are you positive the unconfirmed tx will go away in only a few days?? I was reading about people having them pend forever... making me freak out over here!


I would do this but I don't understand what it even means or how to. Goes straight through my noob brain as of what this means. Just me figuring out how to make a wallet was a feat for me
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:58:51
Yea it said they freezing accounts at 6pm, but what I miscalculated was 6pm EASTERN time...
