No the planet could not sustain crypto adoption in its current form. I would imagine the effects of mass adoption of say bitcoin would be so devastating to the environment that it would be banned like CFCs.

It currently take over 900 kWh to do a single Bitcoin transaction which is over half a million visa transactions btw. Mass adoption would require more electricity than the world currently produces in total. The environmental impact  of the world more than doubling it's energy production would be massive.

Very good point, you never hear about people losing large sums of crypto...

That article basically says to dump bitcoin and buy ethereum or for bitcoin to change significantly to become like  ethereum. Is that really the argument you want to make? 
On a transaction to transaction basis the banking footprint is far better and that is the only fair comparison I can see.

It would take more electricity than is currently produced for Bitcoin to be a viable currency.

I'm a vegan that rides a bike to work and 3 of the 6 rooms in my house are completely empty. But the house is three times older than me and is actually cheaper than a smaller new one here.

Bitcoin is already 0.33% of the world's energy production while being used for nothing by almost no one and it is rising fast. The pollution of this is significant. Mass adoption will destroy the planet faster than any of those.

In Australia a brown coal plant that was shut down is being run up again to mine crypto. Currently Bitcoin uses about 0.5% of the world's electrical production to do almost nothing in terms of world commerce. If it did even 1% of the world's commercial transactions them it would be a pretty devastating blow to the environment.

Lawsuits aren't enough, why not have a small mandatory fee on every bitcoin transaction that goes to a force that maintains the rules and rights of bitcoin, it could be called the Bitcoin Bureau of Investigation. The BBI could be backed up by a central certifying body that legitimizes good traders of bitcoin and smooths out price shocks, a Bitcoin Reserve System if you will.

Everyone has to own a phone for a phone network to have utility but owning a phone doesn't confer ownership of the telecommunications network. One day no one will use a home phone and they will simply shut down that part of the service. Home phones will for the most part become valueless on that day. People move on from things that are no longer useful. A home phone gets less valuable all the time as more and more people stop using or owning them.

I would want the cost of goods to reflect the economic reality though? Why would you want a currency to be economically irrational? In practice arbitrage would force bitcoin with the trend in any case.

There is already vert and lite on LN. I don't need to do anything there is competition before it has even begun use. That's because btc is irrelevant to the idea essentially. That said I don't short or long volatile assets, it's just gambling.

To string people along. If lightning ever really gets off the ground then it will abandon Bitcoin as the only underlying coin pretty quickly. The same principles could be used to trade anything including fiat. The use of Bitcoin is an arbitrary decision and arbitrary decisions change when there is money to be made.

Most people won't care if it's cheaper to use in their immediate environment. Most people aren't going to consider an economic ecosystem when they go to buy items. As long as they are functionally similar but one is cheaper to use that will take precedence. Even crypto people sometimes use dogecoin to move money between exchanges, it's not that they believe in doge it's that it is the easiest cheapest option for their situation.

To have a floor price an asset needs characteristics that grant it some fundamental use case. Bitcoin does not have this so the floor price is zero.

So your moral judgement is that other people polluting means that its okay to pollute? That is akin to the moral compass of a two year old. Other people commit murder does that make it okay for you to murder? Where does this relative morality stop for you?

What's the value of a 20 year old flip phone? In theory it still has the utility of a global communications network but better alternatives mean that it is consigned to the garbage dump. Technology is very fickle. Think about what value that flip phone has to you, yet how much it once cost.

Say the lightning network becomes popular and a major part of crypto commerce, the coin with the cheapest onchain transactions and lightning support will be the most attractive. Bitcoin will not be that coin, so there will be no reason to own it. It'll go to zero

Those things produce electricity, bitcoin consumes electricity. These are not comparable things. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:22:18
You don't own the network though. A bitcoin allows you to use the network like the phone. If you own say a mining machine that has value just like if you own a telephone exchange but the phone/bitcoin is worth only what people will pay for it. I think a problem for a lot of people here is in this analogy, they've bought a phone while believing they've bought a share in a telecommunications network. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:00:49
Or you could just use fiat and not destroy the planet to feel superior. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:41:08
Well I agree it is not a perfect analogy. Your example points to the key difference, there are many digital networks for money transmission instead of the one telecommunications network. In that sense the best network is still to win. Though it would seem adoption wise bitcoin is going backwards and therefore losing this race of utility all the time. No crypto so far has been at all competitive. I'd say crime is a utility but bitcoin is no longer the best network for that either. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:16:11
The way mining is set up after first petahash it isn't making the network anymore secure it is just being competitive in proof of work. So 99.9% is wasted energy done only because bitcoin was setup that way initially.

It being in a hashed longest chain prevents a rewrite. Even a single hash at zero difficulty prevents a rewrite as long as there is a consensus of nodes. I don't think you really understand how a blockchain works.

As soon as there are no buyers an asset is considered to be at zero. It is true that there are very few instances when any asset may be literally bought at zero (I know of only one). No offense but you should learn about investing if that is part of your interest in crypto.

I doubt it. Bitcoin is purely a speculative instrument with no intrinsic value. If there it bleeds out to 2019 then it will go to zero.
