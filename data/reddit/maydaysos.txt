Dude is checking his blockfolio on a gold btc tablet. Lol What cartoon is this?

If btc dominance is at 40 to 46% it would still be number 1. The remaining 54 to 60% would inclide ALL other cryptos
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:08:29
Coins, plural.  It highley unlikely that one other would take more than 50% if btc is at 40+% that means that the other thousand or so crypto only have 10% or less market cap.  Plus bitcoin has been at 40% dominance before and was still number 1.

I know right! I seen a couple other sesame memes and instantly thought of this one.
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:31:29
I think it is. Song is tyt too
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:10:44
you can buy the coins from there but you will want to move them 
to a personal wallet that you own the keys to.

this is a basic video. you should do some research on the different personal wallets that provide your private key. Coinbase does not provide private keys so it is best to move you coins from Coinbase to you personal wallet. I use Mycelium for example. if you have lots of money in bitcoin, it would then be a good idea to hardware wallet
