Since 9th of April 2014 all visitors of BongaCams can use Bitcoin to purchase Tokens!
The decision to start accepting crypto-currency was made in accordance to our aim to provide clients with a wider choice of payment methods they can use. Furthermore, with Bitcoins we hope to significantly increase sales generated by our clients from China, Indonesia and South Korea.
Visitors from Russia won't be able to use Bitcoin to purchase Tokens due to a regulations set by Russian authorities, which clearly prohibits Russians from using the new digital currency.
We are confident that Bitcoin will become a very popular payment method, because Bitcoin gives you the best rate when acquiring Tokens. For example: purchasing 50 Tokens costs 0.0157 Bitcoin (0.0157 Bitcoin – is approximately $7.10). Buying the same amount of Tokens with a credit card will cost you $7.99 NB! Exchange rate is checked upon purchase to ensure it's up to date.

Been in similar situation. About 7-8 years ago I came up with SEO and affiliate program. I was smart, used my knowledge to do arbitrage and get nice profit from that. My revenue was like high management salary in my country. Not big as yours, but I fall into thing you should avoid.
I quit my job. Started my own company to do something new. Idea was good and few years later successfully done by few other companies giving nice return. What went bad? I rest on my laurels. Just it. I really didn't noticed when that happen. I wasn't a guy who just bought expensive things and lost all money. Tried to focus on my relationship, family, friends and... what my future life target should be. I was doing other things, neglecting my job. Company was stalled and then income stopped. It just not worked anymore. I wasn't too concerned about it, because I knew my new business will be great. However I didn't finished it. Tried to until my cash went out.
Yep, you can say I'm idiot, etc. But keep in mind one thing - you should always check in which point you are. It can be easily blurred by all life things. When you lose all money, it's not that you lose all friends. You lose false-friends and got away from real-friends to not show them how bad your situation is. It's not like come back to the beginning, it's like hell.
Another thing is girls. They look on your wealth even when they say opposite or you think opposite. It's natural, they got maternal instinct and money is needed to raise children. Don't look too rich, don't look too cheap. If they see you're successful your rating will become higher, even when they think you don't have much. They just look on your selfconfidence, that's how you probably noticed more attention from them now. Found your love? Be sure about marriage articles. She love you so much now, you love her so much. But after few years things can go bad and it's high probability they will, even when you completely sure they won't.
Find in what other things you're interested and go for it. With attitude "want a girlfriend to settle down" you will stop, rest on your laurels. Don't do that or you will end in a shithole like me.
Do something and live. During your life you will encounter a girl to settle down, just threat it as a natural process, not as hunt or something what needs to be done.
Find your aim, chase it, find another, chase it. Repeat.
