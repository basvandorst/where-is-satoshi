I feel like this sub maybe needs a stickied question thread; I didn't want to make a new thread just for this. Maybe it's a really stupid question, don't know.
I have a BoA credit card with 1% back on all purchases. Could I buy Bitcoins via Coinbase with it and actually get the 1% cash back?

So I shouldn't be looking at places like Coinbase? I was referred there by a friend.

Aaah good catch. Which fees are you referring to?
Edit: ooooh dang 3.75%

Can you expand on this?

I know in general I should move them off Coinbase, but is it absolutely necessary to get them out of there before August?

My coins are with Coinbase right now, but I'm thinking of moving to Electrum due to the upcoming potential fork. Other factors aside, is this a must do?
I downloaded the Electrum app, it wants to know if I want a standard wallet or multi-signature one. What's the difference? Is there one I should definitely choose? When I open the wallet, will it provide me with a bitcoin address that I can use on Coinbase to send it to? Are there fees associated with doing that?

Would it be smart to wait for a small crash before jumping in? This would be my first time with a major investment outside of a Roth 401K so I don't want to rush into anything.

What's happening in August?

Interesting. Is the split looking like a likely event?
