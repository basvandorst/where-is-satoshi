You will most probably not get enough business paid in bitcoin to pay rent every month. It's much better to take the few customers paying in bitcoin and paying it on for things you can buy in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:35:52
What about other things that you can buy on Amazon through purse an save 10% by using bitcoin. 
You could even hedge it in gold on vaultoro and spend the bitcoin when you need it through Bitwala or purse or use spendabit.co where you find thousands of products.

I have been in love with bitcoin since 2010, it sucks seing business casses fall away because of the fees and speeds. It would have been good to have a small increase and segwit and it would have been good if everyone was on the same page. It would have given bitcoin runway to implament lightning and schnorr sigs. Anyway it is what it is but now all these other tokens are getting the network effect of utility.

I really don't care. I said when i got in that i will go to the moon or  burn out trying. In one way i wish i purchased more gold because i could now trade back into way more crypto but i have made many trading mistakes before and hodling has been the best tratagy.  You can officially blame me for the bear market though because if i had put everything into gold then the market would have definitely gone up just to fuck with me lol.
No all jokes aside. I don't need lambos and i don't need bling. I need fiat and central banking to suck my Johnston.

Oh bitcoin community, what have you become. I would love to live in a post enlightened anarchic state. Bitcoin was born from anarchy. The internet is anarchy. You live mostly in anarchy (or does someone force you to love them?) You should read some books on anarchic society if your into crypto.

A stupid financial vehicle that will enable anyone using traditional brokers, stocks and bond markets to buy bitcoin. 
While it's good for the bitcoin price it becomes a mechanism for which the old financial elite with access to trillions can pump and dump the market at will.

Fiat is the real scam. We should not be fighting like this, yes you can not like the project. But let's focus on making a better BTC not tearing down posters of competition. That's like you owning a mcdonalds and mcdowl from coming to America comes along and you spend all your money tearing down his posters instead of expanding.
 The more crypto posters the better. 
Ok down vote me to hell but i live for core and lightning, i just find tearing posters down from other crypto projects is just petty

I agree. Thats why I really like litecoin. Great devs that have been working hard for a long time and working on compressing the blockchain to make it as lite as possible as well as fixing some bugs in the bitcoin protocol. Moving between btc ltc is already a great layer of anonymity.

I feel the same way. I ended up diving in aswell. Sooo easy. you know if you want to be part of a normal IPO I think you need to have minimum 500,000 or somthing like that and some type of licence. After the big money has gotten in us plebs cn usually by stocks no fuss. but with this anyone can! The future is very bright. In about 6 months we will have this on a blockchain so that we don't have Havelock as a counterparty risk. So then the idea is unstoppable.

Litecoin core dev are working on some really interesting blockchain compression problems to make the blockchain lighter. The dev team is really fantastic and litecoin was one of the first alts and the only first alt that is still around. Litecoin Dev's have also worked on the bitcoin protocol and have actively fixed a couple of bugs as well as put bounties up to fix the elusive os x bug wich no one could figure out. (this has now been fixed) 
Litecoin is never going to take over from bitcoin but it is a good sister coin because of network effect as, great Dev's and community.

I lost a heap to man. And it sucks balls. But I have also gone through a heart condition and that has put everything in perspective, what I have learnt is that money comes and money goes and comes again.  The important thing is to think that this is just a game. Imagine if Mario brothers didn't have baddies or traps then it would be the most boring game ever. Life has its traps to highlight  the great times! If you choose today to wake up and make all that you lost back 10 fold. Then you will. 
It's just a game. A crazy mixed up game. :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:59:54
ammmm maybe ending the biggest scam in history, thats all.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:50:03
A very important lesson to learn is why is bitcoin and decentralised money is so revolutionary. You could walk through how and where money comes from. How every dollar in circulation is debt, so pull out a 5er and say I have this 5er and because I have it someone owes a 5er to a bank somewhere with interest! The interest does not yet exist so someone else needs to borrow money with interest that the original borrower has to try to get in order to finalise his original dept. This leaves the second borrower bankrupt unless he can do the same. 
This creates a permanent debt slavery. (maybe a less sensationalist word than slavery can be used but that's what it is) 
Bitcoin is spent into existence and not leant into existence. 
This is sooooo important.
Then on top of that immoral system is the fact that the government can borrow (from the private run federal reserve) unlimited debt. Wich creates inflation. Inflation is a tax on Savers. 
Politicians find it hard to create new direct taxes because voters will not vote you in when you declare that you want to steal money from them. 
So if they promise to build a new bridge they steal by using the cloaked tax of inflation. This taxes Savers because as the gov prints money to pay for promises all fiat currency in circulation or savings become worth less. So spenders are rewarded and Savers robbed. 
Bitcoin on the other hand can not be printed and has a deflationary nature because it is predictably created. 
Anyway just like a good pitch deck to a vc, you have to first layout the problems that are trying to be solved and then explain the solution. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:08:22

I believe it might have a slight effect but people won't adopt many. I think we will see BTC and LTC and then maybe 1 more. 
 people will get scared off adopting any more than 3 because the only difference would be a cool or funny name. The network effect, dedication and skill of the dev team has granted litecoin a spot on the table but I'm not sure what the other coin will be.

Do you know how visa or mastercard networks work? do you understand the underpinnings of paypal, how they configure their servers? Do you know how your phone network handshakes with other networks? No well thats cool because neither do I and I use them anyway. We dont nned to understand everything about bitcoin. At this stage in the life of bitcoin I would say the most important thing to know about bitcoin is..
1:How to get paid in them
2:How to Pay someone with them
3: How to secure your savings with paper wallets
4: How to relax about price cycles and volatility. :)

Look this is another fallacy. Do you really think that because someone takes bitcoin all of a sudden 100% of their sales are going to be in bitcoin. Most people will do a sale here and there and will eat the risk and try to convince their supplier.

I'm interested in what you get out of using their service? I mean their gold fees are really high and it's not even allocated gold like on vaultoro or bitgold. I have been using vaultoro and bitgold but bitgold doesn't let me go back to bitcoin so now I only use vaultoro to hedge in metals.
I used uphold once but don't really understand the use case for them. Their interface looks nice but I also didn't like that they speculate with deposits to make money and that the CEO apparently has no idea about bitcoin or the community.

Forget China news. It's just bullsh1t news about banning bitcoin and embracing it to manipulated the price. 
By a little every week on Monday no matter the price. That way if the price goes up then great and if the price goes down then great to because I'm averaging my buy in costs down as I buy cheaper.
When we are in big upticks I also took profits by converting every week to gold on vaultoro.com and now funily enough in selling the gold back for bitcoin. But I do it every Monday because of the average thing and I just know I will never find the top of bottom of any cycle. But yeah Vaultoro has been awesome for me because of the bank independence I get and so I don't need to trust fiat to take profits. I say this because many people don't think about how to take profits they just talk about hodl but that has lost some friends of mine 90% gains from 2017!

When someone earns bitcoin they are in fact accepting bitcoin and needing people to spend them

Because bitcoin is a deflationary currency many people have said that no one will spend it because theoretically it will be worth more next month. 
The logic though works with computers and phones. 
Why by the new iPhone when there will be one with more festures(more value)  next month. 
The thing is people do upgrade their phones. 
Kind of Wierd analogy and it does need a bridge hahahhaha sorry

The people that spend and restock at the same price are helping hold up the price as well as promote merchant adoption making bitcoin worth way more. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:46:49
Because it ads value to the network knowing that merchants will accept it. When merchants accept it and they don't get one order then they stop accepting it. Also friends at bitpay have told me that most merchants choose to keep their bitcoin income as bitcoin, this is because they get so few sales it would not break the bank if price whent down. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:50:20
No, it's a silly Meme that came out of a  typo on bitcoin talk forums a few years back and everyone found it funny and so has become part of bitcoin nomenclature 
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:38:48
Agreed, I would add that at this stage of the game where still not many people know of bitcoin it is a good idea to spend and restock purely for marketing this new type of money.

There was 1 documented  insident of an overdose the whole time. And for the first time users could give feedback to dealers of how crap their product was and warn others. Try doing that on the street  corner without getting shot! 
Also it wasn't even entrapment for murder. It was nothing, no evidence and no trial, all charges dropped. Just bullshit fake news spread by the FBI to remove DPR from the droves of people that thought he was a hero. Knowing that the news will stick even when it comes out that all charges for that were dropped and no evidence shown. And it worked. People keep repeating these false alergations like a parrots without ever researching more than 5 minutes.

Actually I have friends at bitpay and most merchants don't insta sell. Most keep their coins because they get so few orders in bitcoin that it will not break the bank if the price tanks. 
Also, bitcoin is not only valuable because you can hold it. It's valuable because you can use it. I can tell you that bitcoin has gotten way more useful now. When I first started, you could get some alpaca socks and that's all. Bitcoin was worth sweet f all back then.
With every new merchant came more usefulnes. I can now easily live in the bitcoin ecosystem.

What is this? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:19:38
Thanks for your answer. 
I didn't think the block size limit was to raise tx fees. My point was that miners need to have an incentive to mine. Satoshi wanted bitcoin have so many tx's that the fees would eventually take over from block rewards. 
How does it look if the amount of on chain tx's don't go up and the fees also don't, will miners have enough incentive to mine? 
I hope so. 
I really love the idea behind LN. It brings nano transactions and all sorts of cool stuff but miners need to be paid.

@_date: 2016-12-20 11:34:10
I have some questions, but first some reasoning. Fees on the main chain should go up because of the block size cap. It has too because supply of space in blocks is limited and demand will hopefully keep growing. 
Fees also need to rise because at the end of the day tx fees should take over from block rewards for miners for the systems game theoretical balance to keep going. Because we have all decided that lifting the blocksize is too dangerous we are going for a layer two solutions. 
So my questions are. 
Do I have to pay a huge on chain fee to fund and close my channel? 
If so, what are the incentives to close the channel? 
Will wallets Auto open and close channels (settle to the blockchain) ever day, week or month? 
Say I want to pay someone like steam  99 cents for a game and don't have a channel open. Is it worth me opening a channel if the fee is going to be 3 bucks to open and 3 to close? 
Or is it like an ATM withdrawal where I get a big fee so I withdrawal 200 bucks even though I only need 5 bucks? Meaning I need to pay steam 99cents for a game so I open a channel for 50 bucks and keep it open to use with other purchases for a month (or however long the blockchain settlement cycle is).
Interesting times. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:04:26
Nobody wants it but it's happening and bitcoin and gold are great hedges. 
If your on a bus driving along a cliff and the driver has a heart attack, it's not negative yo point out that he is have a hart attack and try to grab the wheel. It's not like people want the guy to have a heart attack because they are pointing out that he is having one. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:09:40
I already have and is a bit silly. 
I have been in bitcoin for a long time and by spending and restocking you are creating upward pressure while also spreading value through the network of people. World of mouth between merchants and usefulness of a currency is paramount. 
When a I could buy back in the day was alpaca socks the currency was worth 5 bucks, with every new merchant coming on board the currency raised in value. I can now stay in the bitcoin economy. Get paid in BTC, and pay people in BTC. 
I use the Re-hodl concept of spend and restock at the same time.
I can absolutely guaranty that the price of bitcoin would be very very very very low if not zero, if there where no merchants accepting it, no one sending it to each other and no utility. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:55:49
But does it really matter what people wish? I mean it makes no difference. 
Sorry continuation of analogy: people bought the other company tickets because the bus drivers on the government Busses where massively overweight. It's not the peoples fault that the bus drivers look like heart attacks walking. They saw it and thought, nope I'm taking the private company. 
Ok so it's utterly repulsive when people  cheer on the downfall, pain and misery. For sure! Things like "Hahaha the bus driver had a heart attack and now 60 people are dead"  
I think we are on the same page. Celebrating people suffering is just wrong full stop. But there are subtleties around tragedies that look celibratory on the outset but arn't. There is a little "I told you so, joy" or "yay! my family wasnt on that bus that crashed because I decided to buy another ticket" or even a bit of trolling "omg your getting on that bus? LOL, idiot" that many feel. 
Or "omg he can't survive long because he weighs 300kg, don't use that bus along those cliffs, you will die! " I think is normal. 
Or being happy that you grabbed the wheel from the driver as he was having the heart attach and driving the people to safety and then celebrating that you saved so many lives is also normal.
It can look like you are celebrating the drivers death but actually you are celebrating that you helped save as many people as you could. 
But "wishing" for a downfall is pointless anyway, it makes no diferance what anybody wishes. It's the actions of the Cenral banks of the world that actually creates the downfall and suffering. 
Ill finish this off with a wierd old saying my mum used to say "If wishes where fishes, we'd all live in the sea"

That's why I love what  [vaultoro]( have brought to this space for years now. Always stuck with btc. One single pair bitcoin / gold. It's so weird that we give so much attention to Peter Schiff who is only negative when vaultoro are doing such cool stuff for bitcoin and gold.

I think there could be another reason no one is paying you in bitcoin. Because of the type of business you have. If I own bitcoin dont want a locksmith knowing it. I would then be permanently stressed that they would break in and try to find my seed phrase. I know you probably would not, but people have to trust you way more than any other type of business that doesnt need your address and doesnt know how to open a door as smooth as butter.
But nevertheless I think it's great that you accept bitcoin.

Jihan Wu waited until the new period to fire up a massive amount of miners to not signal. This has taken litecoin segwit signaling from around 85% just below 75% which is the threshold. We need to hold the average threshold above 75% for 2 weeks and would love the help of any retired GPU's to fire up and start pointing at a segwit signaling pool. This will also show miners that segwit pools are more popular.

I'm tired of people in the press trying to put a square peg into a round hole.
Traditional classes do not count. This is a whole new asset class.
When i say rare number i mean that 
Gold is a rare metal, it is found and spent into existence.
Bitcoin is a rare number, it is found and spent into existence.
Fiat is a infinite number, it is printed into existence as debt.
Bitcoin can be spent as a instantly so also a unit of exchange, 
It can be programmed so it is also software
Bitcoin is a rare number that can be used in many ways and does not fit into traditional models.

I use vaultoro for my gold hedging, I met the co-founders at a conference and those guys are old school hardcore bitcoiners obsessed with transparency.  I haven't tried bitgold and not sure where their founders stand. The Gold buffs that I know are starting to understand and love bitcoin, when they see that gold can once again be used to back something like bitcoin by swapping in and out of it or creating a token that represents it and sending it around the world. I feel gold will play a big part in money of the future when I think about it with what vaultoro and bitreserve are doing. But if the bitreserve guy thinks bitcoin is going away why even start the business?

I really like these guys. I started trading on vaultoro around 7 months ago and volume is increasing all the time wich is great because when I first found them the order book was a bit thin, I guess that's normal for any exchange when they start out, look at Gemini! LOL. I especially like their public audit sollution. It's pretty innovative and well thought out, I wish other exchanges would take a page out of their book when it comes to transparency. Wish they had a referral program though.

@_date: 2015-03-15 22:39:42
I use  to trade bit/gold. From my research they are the most transparent exchange by far. Thier fees are the lowest in the space (bitreserve and bitgold) except bitgold doesn't charge a vaulting fee. Vaultoro is also a true bitcoin gold exchange which I like where as bitreserve and bitgold only give you their spread so I cant set my own prices.
 But loving being able to back my bitcoin with real money (gold) now and trade with it.
I remember wanting this a few years back and now it's all possible. Thats why bitcoin will win because people can build platforms all over the world that interfaces with bitcoin in great ways.

Once apon a time there was an evil c+nt called jihan who was willing to do anything to get his way. He stood to have a massive advantage over other people in a competition that would win him hundreds of millions of dollars per year. But the people watching the competition and loved it wanted every participant to have a fair go but they also wanted to make the competition bigger so more people could bet in it.
To do this the people had to change the rules a little bit but evil jihan hated this because then he would have to compete fairly as the new rules took away his advantage over others.
So he set out to attack the new rules in such away that would destroy the new rules before it would get a chance to be secure.
The end.

No one knows if Satoshi that has. It has not been touched. Most likely just lost coins. And bitcoin was first there was no way to know it would be worth anything. Now that cryptocurrencies are well established to have super easy start mine and give out tools late and then give coins to marketers then I would see that as a scam get rich quick and leave thousands with an empty bag.

Thats my pitch to Greenies all the time! look people stop consuming so much crap! If you are going to buy something with your precious bitcoin or litecoin it better be damb good quality and not break on the second day.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:57:17
Thats why I don't trust them. They are not making very little on transfers maybe. I know BTC China want to charge a premium for extra services. But yeah I don't trust an exchange that charges nothing because they are sitting on millions of dollars wich could corrupt anyone if they are not making money. Not saying BTC China will do anything because they are creating new revenue streams but yeah. Its a catch 22 for exchanges because they make it free to get users. 
If I was an exchange I would say you get 6 free trades a month or somthing like that. 
Anyway just my thoughts

If they aren't obvious scams I don't care. But I am in it to bust up this dept based monetary monopoly the global banking order has on us all and to do that I support bitcoin and litecoin has been there through thick and thin and the Dev's have helped out on bitcoin to. But at the end of the day it is about financial anarchy. Fuck the rulers, respect the rules of mathematics :-) 
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:48:04
They are not scammers. They are trying to appease the Mafia governments and banking institutions, they are what are holding up transfers not gox them selves. Mtgoxs banks accounts where flagged after the liberty reserve crap and then the US stole millions off them for regulatory bullshit. So they are trying to be over the top when it comes to know your customer rules. 
There is no proof of insolvency and so saying that publicly is not fair. 
Yes they should definatly be more open but I think the community should stop bashing these bitcoin veterans that have taken on a lot of battles for the community. 
Just my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:09:28
The question should be. Can we still change the world with this.

I think it is a huge mistake to ban bitcoin in Thailand.
Thailand is going to miss out on the biggest financial revolution to hit the world. Bitcoin is like apple was in the early 80's and you should jump on the band wagon now!
Thailand will be left in the dark ages.

LTC was already at $8 befor Keiser said anything and would have gone up without him because there is a massive userbase. Quark has nothing just a bunch of scammers holding 98% of all coins giving thier mates a few, holding everything making people think the market cap is high and then they will dump and stop development. I don't say this because I hate them in fact I don't mind alts I just hate people being suckerd into scams and I over the last 3 years have seen so many people being led into scam coins but it will just keep on happening. At least Litecoin has a great dedicated Dev team!

@_date: 2013-08-01 07:10:47
Facepalm 
one could argue that scrypt allows for more equality in distribution of hash rate than SHA256. A more distributed hash rate means entities have a smaller share of the hash rate, meaning less likelihood of an attack or some kind of disruption to the overall network hash rate in case some big miner goes offline. Imagine if AsicMiner got their operated halted for instance, that would put a big dent in the hash rate, increasing confirmation times, and making bitcoin temporarily vulnerable to attack.
Leaving litecoin as a temp safe heaven.
 It also seems like SHA256 ASICs will continue to increase in performance at close to the rate of Moore's Law. The memory requirements of scrypt could prevent that somewhat, meaning accessible hardware doesn't become obsolete as quickly. This means people with slightly older hardware are still able to mine instead of all the hash rate going to only those who can afford to keep up with the latest and greatest hardware.
The Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast's recent episode discussed this a bit.

I would like to see more development of the mutually assured destruction bitcoin trading system. This is a great way to cut out the centralisation of banks so that you send funds directly to the other user.
Basically you set up a trade and both parties put double of what they want to buy and sell into a pot. If anything goes wrong with the trade then any party can destroy the pot and the money disappears or goes to the webapp owner to keep the service going. 
As it is double of what you are buying or selling the opportunity costs are lost by trying to steal the coins in the trade by not wiring the money or not saying that the money never arrived.
What problem does this fix?
This problem that is fixed is the issue of banks shutting down the accounts of centrally controlled exchanges. A bank would never know that you are trading bitcoin as it is not being sent to a bitcoin business but a bitcoin user.

This article is exactly what comes out of jealous people. Who gives a shit if some people are filthy rich? You can still receive BTC for your business or service and then spend it. Yes the get rich part of adoption might be coming to an end but that doesn't matter. The fact that this is not a currency of dept is what matters. As for the alts.... Well ltc has a great dev team that also help out on the bitcoin project and I like having 2 competent competing blockchains but all the other ones are just pump and dump central checkpoint controled scams. 
The writer is a typical confused jealous communist type. The early adopters risked a lot of time and or money to make BTC good. It cod have failed and they would have lost. But they believed in the project and risked and then it paid off. There is no such thing as even Steven. Some people love money others love to live on baked beans and surf all day. They don't want to be even. At the end of the day it doesn't matter about the rich it matters that we are building an alternative currency that is spent into existence not lent into existence. 
That's the real difference.

I don't want to start one. I just don't like having all my eggs in one basket. Litecoin has a great Dev team led by the founder of Fedora Linux who also contributes the the bitcoin protocol. I love that SCRYPT (the hashing algo) is allot more memory intensive making centralisation of miners harder. There is no risk to bitcoin at all from litecoin. But yeah I find monopolies abhorrent even in blockchains. Having alts creates competition and keeps developers pushing for better secure features. And litecoin is the only one I would trust because of the dev team and market cap

First of all im not "you guys." I'm an individual. I have never seen this post and don't know the guy. I don't appreciate being groups in. I do think competition is good but bad competitors are simply bad competitors. I don't see any other blockchain that has a good enough dev team or community. So I don't think that there is any other coin worth promoting and trying to work with BTC, LTC AND namecoin seam the only option but Namecoin also has problems now so BTC LTC seem like the best options for me personally. Fuck this group think. I'm am not a group.

Because quark is a fucking scam, it was pre mined, they say thousands of working class people mined them but that's bull shit. The Dev's mined nearly all of them and you are either a dev or a bag holding fool. Litecoin is not just a copy past. They are working hard to create a liter blockchain. They have been working on making the litecoin protocol for 2 years. The dev team is dedicated and not a bunch of greedy pump and dumpers. In fact the founder had to sell at around 40 cents because he needed the money at the time. He has got only a small holding but still works hard on the protocol. The lead dev works on donations and also works on the bitcoin protocol submitting security commits. Look I think alts have thier place but quark is a scam pump and dump. You can see this your self. You can't go from 0 to 60million market cap in 3 days and not have any infrastructure, or history, and they actually have hundreds of millions of coins already mined. Please be a bag holder if you want but stick with bitcoin or if you really want to dabble in alts litecoin but everything else is supper dodgy. I have studied them all extensively. Stay away if you like your money.

Mutually assured destruction. You get both parties to put in twice as much bitcoin as they are buying into a deposit pot. Anyone of the party can destroy the pot if things go sour. If everything goes well, you receive cash in the bank or in the mail or what ever then you sign the release of the deposit and send him the coins. Then you and the other party get your deposit back. Then you party and stick your fingers up at the state.
now run this peer to peer and you have a decentralised trading network. bit slower and no good for high frequency and you need some coins to start with but hey.
Just a thought.

Wow! This is fantastic! For ages I have wanted one of these. The thing is that currently we only have 1 way traffic. That is that people pay in bitcoin and the usually gets converted in realtime to fiat. So the bitcoins go from a spender to an exchange and get purchased usually by an investor. The problem with this is that investors don't usually spend thier investments. 
When you earn bitcoins you are more likely to spend them. 
So currently we have an economy that's not getting money in the hands of spenders but more investors. 
This is the kind of business that will change all that. 
I have a few questions though. 
*how do you get passed the know your customer rules? 
*what's the Max invoice I can charge?
*Are you able to drop the cost? 
*where are you based? 
*Are you concerned about US regulations moving forward?

Not true, I'm mad that Bill who I respected bashed crypto currencies for so long and then wakes up and instead of coming out and saying it's actually a great idea that we should all get behind he gets given hundreds of thousands of some start up pre mined scam and tries to scam his fans. I don't give a shit about other alts. I don't like scams.

Yeah this happened to me to! So crap! electrum works a lot better!
So what I did to fix it was get your wallet.dat file 
then install the QT client on different mac.
copy the old wallet.dat file onto the new computer and replace the new wallet.dat file with it.
Then launch the new bitcoinQT install. 
Install electrum on your old mac and send all your bitcoins from the newly installed bitcoinQT to electrum.
I think it has something to do with python because bitmessage crashes in a similar way and so does the litecoinQT wallet. ARG.
Hope that helps.

Lol the crash. I remember when it hit 30 then crashed back to 2 and everyone was like "fuck, this is the end!" dude there are only around 12 million in circulation currently most of those are in cold storage. Massive amounts of people are just now finding out about it but it is still really hard to get into. Black markets alone are trillions then the global grey markets, then the massive white markets. Dude this is just the beginning. This really is a Christmas sale.

Fuck dude that sucks! Did you get your money in the end? 
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:36:16
Yeah that sucks man. I'm sure it will come through the pipes soon enough. but yeah still sucks. I think they must be getting allot of people withdrawing BTC with this high volume and I'm sure their hot wallet only has so many coins in it per 24 hours. for security reasons. I'm sure you will get it today. But then again they said it was already in the blockchain. Did you send him a link of the address to show that he is wrong. I get a feeling it is just a lazy support guy and really my explanation is what is causing the delay.

Oh my god, really?
I know what a god damb arb is, I have been doing it in sports betting for years.
Ok I'm talking about arbing the BTC/LTC but strangely enough this in turn also evens out the btc / USD and LTC / USD just because markets work like that.
Markets (the crowd) watches different variants and makes a decision on value. 
An example of this is that  you can not repatriate money out of china so their exchanges really should do their own thing. But no, the movements are generally the same as EURO markets.  Why when they are so separate?
Because markets work like this. Sometimes deviating but mostly following each other.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:17:15
LOL thats true

the market will react. but actually if you have that many coins and havn't touched them then you would sell them slowly as you need the money.
@_date: 2013-07-20 04:05:43
Yes but if I create 2 public addresses from the private key and send 5 BTC to public address 1 and 0 BTC to public address 2 then I check public address 2, I can't see what's on public address 1. Even though they are both derived from the same private key. 
So I guess the question is how is the change going back to the same private key if you only tell mycilium the private key? Or does the private key change every time you create a new pub key, thus it has wich pub keys have been created within it? 
@_date: 2013-10-05 09:06:18
Bobby, there are so many projects happening that fix all of this. Checkout Coinjoin for example, it is a decentralised mixing service. Allot of people are building protocols layers on top of bitcoin and litecoin that it will become impossible to trace. We are in the really early days.

Because it is a scam. Its people pumping dumping. It has no inafraucture, bitcoin and litecoin has had years of infrastructure and development. It is also pre mined wich means the first holder have all the coins and then give them out to thier friends and then dump them when all the suckers come in.

I think it would work. But I remember something about Paypal not allowing purchase of virtual currencies. Charge backs will not be a problem because you are paying out. (unless you charge back) 
Edit. But it can only be a 1 way street. You pay cash out. It won't work with people buying crypto currencies from you. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:17:20
Yes, china overstepped what they said and told payment gateways that they cant be used to fund bitcoin exchanges. I think.... not sure
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:40:12
They don't control the currency even if they had 99 percent of the coins, because I can't print bitcoin out of thin air.

You will be a bag holding fool if you don't do your own research. The scam coin whent from 0 to 60million market cap in 3 days. It has no infrastructure nothing. You can not go from woe to go like this especially if the owners and bill still owne most of the coins. Look I'm not here to convince you of anything if you can't figure out that they are scamming you massively then you will be left with an empty bag and and think fuck why did I just buy into that scam. And you can feel double as shameful for dragging others into it as well.

I think we need both people in suits and people like Amir in the media as it only attracts more diverse crowd of people. Remember businesses don't care who you are but what you spend your cash on. The only people that care who you are is the state and I don't care about the state I care about crypto currencies.

If there is a scam coin and I don't warn people of it then I feel like shit because people are going to be left holding an empty bag and then hating on the whole crypto currency movement. I don't mind competing currencies but if there is one that is obviously a scam then I say something. Go on buy it all up go for it but don't come crying to me when it runs out of steam! I meen come on 0 to 60 million dollar market cap in 5 days or what ever!!! with 98% premined to the devs who bribe spammers and marketers and big players like Bill Still.  Go on then people Buy it but you will be sorry when they all convert back to an established coin with actually uses.  This is the crypto hype making a few clever coders super rich.

No I don't like thier system. I like decentralised only. 
I really like litecoin because it is another competent blockchain. I have pulled off arbitrage ops in 1 hour (not days like fiat) on exchanges that accept both BTC and ltc and it is a really great way to go.
 It really helps exchanges become similar in price so that people know what price to quote but also so stores can start pricing in BTC not fiat. 
I love that it is the founder of Linux fedora as lead dev on litecoin. I really like the effort he is putting in to make the litecoin blockchain lite. A lot of work has gone into making the blockchain smaller and faster with less CPU overload. There really is a lot of work under the hood and people just repeat the same FUD over and over. 
I agree with Eric about confirmation times. It doesn't really matter. But the rest I mention does. 
It doesn't matter what I think because the market decides, but I think it is a great little brother of bitcoin and can work together.

Maybe write a press release about how bitcoin is revolutionising schooling by globalising teachers and students. (thats the kind of headline that gets printed.) Maybe take litecoin to. There are heaps of old bitcoin miners mining that now with the old hardware so you can widen your pool of potencial cclients. Also there is now a company where your clients can wire cash and you get BTC, this is great for international students who don't have an American bank account and find it hard to get bitcoin from places like coin base. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:37:13
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:55:37
Also whats unprofitable mean? Because yeah it might be if you cash out now but in 5 years the few you mine now might be worth allot more. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:13:44
This is just one but there are plenty of others just search 
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:56:24
Because it needs to be done correctly. And there is so much at stake.

Could it handle bitcoin and litecoin the markets need a second crypto in place for arbitraging.

Thanks for this!

Your bank will also gamble with your savings and steal your savings if they gamble wrong. See Greece , Cyprus
@_date: 2013-10-05 09:21:37
Yeah there is someone but I'm on my phone so I can't find it. I know it is on bit starter or one of the bitcoin crowd funding sites. It might even be on kickstarter. Not sure, 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:50:58
yeah but on the other hand look at the game company whos employee put mining software on the players hardware. They lost a massive market share, Is now in a class action law suit, and it is really hard to recover from that. But I do agree that its really not safe to keep your savings on an open machine. Paper wallets are the absolute best but..... the whole point of bitcoin is the convenience which is messed up with paper wallets! so hardware wallets are the way to go.

There is a community because it's not only a currency but also a statement of fuck this, I'm not only changing banks I'm changing systems. And along with that comes like minded people. I love to spend my BTC and LTC because it's great to get others away from the crap system of fractional reserve central banking to grass roots gold 2.0 for the people by the people. What's this market research for BTW?

No it is the other way around. The more people spend the more they will be worth. This is just a fact of the markets.

No I'm proud of our community. We have even helped out bitcoin. We put a huge bounty up for the os x bitcoin Qt Bug wich has now been fixed. Warren has put in multiple pull requests on security patches he has developed for Bitcoin and litecoin. And we are developing technology to lighten the blockchain as much as possible. Its kind of shitty that there is so little respect. I understand it with all these scam coins and yes there are just people trying to get rich off litecoin with out contributing anything but that is the same with bitcoin. I hold both and help out both. The point for me is to bring down gov controled fiat and entrenched banking cartels.

yip, I would. I want to earn bitcoins and spend them.
The thing is that if you buy bitcoins then you dont really want to spend them because you purchased them for an investment so they are like savings. If you earn them then you will want to spend them because well you want to live of your earnings.
Its super important that people start earning in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:20:21
oh ok
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:59:13

I haven't got any bitcoins in the bitcoin tip bot at the moment but here are some litecoins so you can play with some crypto. 
:) bitcoin and crypto is so fricken good. once you have some you will understand how ground breaking it is. I can send $20,000 to a friend in India and he will get $20,000 with in seconds without anyone taking a cut and if we want without anyone knowing who is recieving what. anyway here are some litecoins. +$5 litecoins

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:34:08
Yes they did, they banned crypto currencies to be used how they are meant to be used. To buy and sell things with. The also banned banks and money transmitters to send money to exchanges. So theres that. but yes they didn't ban bitcoin alltogether. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:33:42
yes please and litecoin while your at it.

Q: Does my BItcoin deposit address change?
Yes, the deposit address listed on the “Add Funds" page will change every time a deposit to the address is made.
But the bitcoins I sent went twice to the same address. AAArrrgh Has electrum done this to anyone else?

I think the best thing to do is not buy crypto but work for it and don't sell it but use it to buy stuff. The more we rely on exchanges the worse it is as they charge such high fees. 
I think the Jewish people are clever because they use kosher food. So all the money stays in the community making the community richer. We need to support other companies or people that use bitcoin. Products need to be bitcoin (kosher) lol
I think the best thing we could do is try to get farmers to use bitcoin. Everyone needs food. I say USE not accept Because they need to move money around. 
But folks stop selling your bitcoins and start spending them instead and if you accept bitcoin as a business stop insta-converting them into fiat. Try to get your supplier to accept them. 
See it as money and not just a store of value.

These questions are super easy. Its the first thing everyone thinks of when you ask your self how a stateless society would work. There is some background in understanding how private law works.

It is so if you have an infected computer then you should create your paper wallets while not being online.

Please read my post again. You don't send money to a central exchange. There is no central exchange. In this system you send fiat currency directly to the other persons account. This is why you both put a BTC deposit into a dual signed public key. either party can destroy the pot at any time if the other party scams them. But they wont scam them because they are loosing twice as much as they would be gaining by scamming you.

Man I think content discovery is super important especially to indy artists. The best way to go would be to let users compile radio stations or guest DJ by clicking some play next button or something.
Then have multiple "radio stations that people can listen to with different genres. 
The only way I see legacy currencies working in this scene is by letting people buy "credits" (or bitcoin LOL) in bigger amounts like $20 worth and then they can spend them in small chunks. Its just the CC or paypal fees would be way to much otherwise.

@_date: 2013-08-15 06:18:52
Yeah i always wander if I put 5.153 in and some address gets 5.153 out after a week then it seems easy to figure out. 
Seems to me that a mixing service would need multiple output address for the one input and be split up over time and amounts. But yeah mixing services are so important for businesses. I think regulators will try to chop off heads of mixing services so a decentralised version like zero coin is important. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:23:50
I don't think so. I think it could be a way for banks to naked short sell the bitcoin and suppress the price just think they do with silver and gold. But maybe wall Street has changed its tune and banks have stopped thier giggery pokery, LOL and I'm a monkeys uncle.

You can. You just cant price things in bitcoin. But this is how everything works now anyway. you price things in US, EUR or CYN and then at checkout you pay with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:19:24
for sure, they really need to get there shit together. I'm just saying that They are getting royally fucked by the banks and we are blaming gox. No one is blaming the bank of japan or whoever the fuck they use. 
And also they have not done the bolt and said they where hacked like so many other bitcoin companies have so there is that.

The price would go to infinity.
This is why in a truly unregulated market you can never have a monopoly. Governments create monopoly. This is because as you buy up your competition the next person raises his prices until you get to infinite.

I would contact as many businesses as you can and try to get them to start accepting LTC. There are going to be 2 main crypto currencies maybe 3 and I feel litecoin will be in that even though there is not much diferant. Litecoin has been very stable over the past year and the whole got thing will open it up to api access to payment gateway can allow stores to easily accept and convert. 
I would hold. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:38:17
This is a coin mixer, it makes it so that a competitor in your industry or the government can not trace your coins. If it sent instantly then anyone could trace the coins. "Oh what went in $500 bucks and what came out instantly to this random address $500, thats our guy's new address then." To stop this a heap of peoples btc get pooled together and then you get random peoples btc = to 5BTC or what ever it was originally but sent to you in random chunks at random times.
Your coins are safe

These guys are good, I used them for buying my HTC one as they run the site e4btc.com .
The thing is that while BTC is such a small economy and not many big players accept bitcoin yet we need these interfaces. The other thing was that I did not have enough cash to pay my bills so this worked out great! It also would have cost me more and taken ages to cash out of an exchange and pay my bills in cash. So I think your statement is not fair. If they where fair then we should not use bitpay as they are an interface to legacy currencies.
We need all sorts of interfaces.
I agree however it would be better to be able to pay things in bitcoin and not use a conduit service. But I had to pay my bills and so this was a good option for me as I did not have the cash on me.

nope I think the network effect will allow 2 to dominate. Just like coke and pepsi, McDonnell's and burger king, Windows and Mac, Republicans and Democrats. It looks like bitcoin and litecoin might be the 2 big cryptos moving forward. But in the future if something comes out much better we could see a third. Just like google has come up to challenge Microsoft and apple.

From the litecoin forum.
MacOS X LevelDB Corruption Bounty (6.00 BTC + 200.2 LTC)  
Bitcoin and Litecoin devs funded this huge bounty to attract an experienced mac engineer to figure out the cause of this issue.

even if he cashed out the price would drop and would come right back up again. Also he is a smart guy he would cash out slowly.
Also how do we know he didn't mine them and then lost the keys. You have to remember that this was super early days where bitcoin was literally worth nothing! nothing!  and only had a future in crypto anarchists heads.

I totally agree but... if every junk coin gets adopted then it is not 21 million anymore but infinite which will = zero value which = central banks win!
Look at the people posting they are only in it for the money thats why they say things like.. it doesn't matter if it is pre mined! Well the whole point is to get away from central banks "pre-mining" their own currency.

It would be interesting to also count alternative clients like electrum. Because I know 8gig download is way to much for new players who don't have any bitcoins yet. They would say things like like "why am I downloading 8gig of nothing??" 
Then tell their friends.. Yeah I tried bitcoin but I had to take 23 days to download an 8Gig file then I opened it and it was ugly and I didn't know what to do."
Friends interest goes away and they talk about bread and circuses again. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 09:32:44
Ok here is one example. 
Online you want to by some digital content like access to a story or information or a song. Let's say it's a news article that has a type of pay wall. The charge is 20cents. 
Firstly you do not want to put your name and address and credit card details on the site to read 1 article but you would send 0.002 (or what ever it is) bitcoin to an address that then let's you through. Without giving any of your identity or credit card info out. 
Its not illegal it just can't be done with anything else. Crypto is a better form of cash. 
Also you could say to your mum " if your not doing anything illegal then why use cash? Just use credit cards." She would see the flaw In that argument to I hope.

Although I do agree with you in 1 way I do think competition is important and think that scypt may in deed be a great blockchain to minimise consolidation of mining. I meen when I see the 2 shipping container water cooled miners from AM I think Wow this is to much power in the hands of 1.
SCRYPT does diversify this. 
I also think it is a good way to iron out the massive peaks and troffs in the bitcoin price by letting speculators arbitrage on exchanges a lot easyer. 
I really don't give Merritt to any other coin because of the reasons you mentioned but feel that litecoins dev team (wich also help out on bitcoin) is extremely competent and dedicated. 
Yes the arbitraging will be happening between btc/ltc but this does effect the btc/usd across multiple exchanges. This will really help bitcoin be more stable with a nice up trend instead of a roller coaster wich means we have to price everything in currencies we all hate (fiat).

That is scary. I guess just don't put your password in twice.

Put a few specular scratch marks on the coins to make them look a bit used. 
Take this 
Then crush the blacks and whites so you see mainly black with a heap of white lines and then project or uv map that onto the specular channel.
3D always needs grunge and imperfections to look real. :)

Quark has no infrastructure, 98% of the coins that will ever be  where mined by the Dev's up front. Litecoin has been around for 2 years, has a great dev team and is working hard on some great ideas to do with lighter blockchain propagation. You can't compare quarks scam coins to litecoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:58:31
Not true, I'm mad that Bill who I respected bashed crypto currencies for so long and then wakes up and instead of coming out and saying it's actually a great idea that we should all get behind he gets given hundreds of thousands of some start up pre mined scam and tries to scam his fans. I don't give a shit about other alts. I don't like scams.

Mtgox s main problem is that during the liberty reserve thing they got flagged on the banking networks and now no bank wants to touch them. They should just change thier name and start a fresh with the banking system. LoL

The bitcoin community needs to start getting paid in bitcoin! all this is doing is pooling everyones bitcoin to 1 company and then they sell it on an exchange to speculators or investors.
Speculators and investors don't spend bitcoins. People that earn bitcoin are more likely to spend bitcoin.
We need to stop with this USD conduit bull.
To fix this, Put on your old lady hat and nag them to let people withdraw bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:43:45

@_date: 2013-09-28 05:37:39
I would also say that bitcoin is spent into existence and not lent into existence. And how the current system's money is leant into existence keeping everyone as dept slaves.

Litecoin and bitcoin are a great pair. I think SCRYPT Is a very important differentiation as a hedge against anything bad happening to BTC blockchain. The Warren (dev lead on LTC) was lead dev on fedora Linux and the founder of litcoin is ex google and now works for coinbase, his brother is CEO of btcchina. Litecoin has a massive network effect jump Nd it's market cap is bigger than all alts put together. I also think it's a great hedge against redlists by being able to clean through litcoin. All in all im not a fan of any other alt but BTC and LTC are like 2 peas in a pod. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:42:36

Face palm. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:54:17
What do you meen? 3 out of 5 exchanges in the china trade LTC and BTC. I think it is a good diversification into another competent blockchain. I believe in crypto currency as a revolution in banking. Both ltc and BTC have a really great dev team. BTC has Gavin and ltc has an ex google guy founder and the lead dev was the founder of fedora Linux who also helps on the bitcoin code. 
I think competition in currency is super important and will only make this revolution stronger. 
From what I can see is the exchanges with both ltc and BTC seem to be a little less volatile as people spread risk. I don't care if I am a bag holder because it's not about the bag I have been in bitcoin since 2010 and for me it is much more than profit. It is full out assault on the banking cartels. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:32:07

@_date: 2013-12-13 16:03:24
I think you are correct that is why I have always tried to get businesses to accept bitcoin without using a payment gateway. The businesses that I have got on board only do a few sales with bitcoin so it's ok for them to save and spend them. 1 has even managed to get a supplier to accept bitcoin. (well litecoin but what ever) 
The thing is that we need people to accept bitcoin and then spend the bitcoin, not sell it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:38:32
I cant see it anywhere on twitter.
Can anyone confirm or read this? Uhg.

@_date: 2013-10-27 15:47:35
What do you mean? I think it is only American banks having issues.
And really it's not Gox it is the banking system trying to fuck them over. It is important that the bitcoin community support companies that try to lead the way. not diss them constantly. If you hate them so much you try opening up an exchange.

From more research this is not true. Merchants are aloud to trade for bitcoin under the barter rules. Barter is perfectly legal in China. you can walk to any store and offer a 1 ounce gold for goods. you cant force them to take it but if it voluntary then it is legal.  So WOO HOO!!

If you look at the graph of BTC anyone that had held longer than a month at any price has come out on top. Most businesses that accept business in BTC would not do to many sales in BTC so could most probably just keep it in BTC without converting. Tell your friends, tell your family. Its all good.

This would have been a phishing scam email. Probably got your email from the bitcoin talk hack or the original gox hack 2 years ago. 
The link you clicked on in that fake email goes to a website that would look like gox but is not. 
Maybe it was something like Mt.goxs.com or somthing that the eye misses. 
In the email it could say mtgox.com but it is just masking the fake URL and so if you don't look at the URL in the browser properly well then you get scammed. 
Then when your talking to help and giving your details your talking to some scammers instead. 
I Never never never click on links in emails from banks or financially sensitive sites. I always read the email and then open a browser and type in the bank or exchange URL. That way I know I'm not clicking a masked URL.
