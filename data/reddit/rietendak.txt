It's more like the VICE of financial news.

Yes, guy with one post on reddit. 'That guy' - who certainly isn't you - really seems like he needs help.

Why? That's just really really dumb. So they buy bitcoins, and after a week if they increased in value he gets to say "yeah, gimme", and if they fell he says "nah, I'll take cash this week". Either way the company *loses*. What's their incentive?

It's just really weird that American banks charge so goddamn much for everything. In The Netherlands, you pay a yearly fee (like 20 bucks) and transfers, getting money out of ATM's, depositing money, paying online, paying with your phone etc are all completely free. The banks make money by charging people in the red and that's it (and really shady shit in the stock world, but that doesn't affect an ordinary customer unless the system collapses).
Using my bank is so, so, so much easier than using bitcoin. Cheaper and faster even! But I can totally understand why Americans would rather just get rid of their banks completely.

And the name of that woman? Satoshi Nakamoto.

You live on a pebble floating through space and everything that has ever happened to you or will ever happen to you is completely meaningless.

Will bitcoin be more valuable at certain times in the future than it is now? Probably.
Will it grow so fast and big that you can be like the guy who bought in for $25 three years ago and is now a millionaire? Probably not.

I won't, but if I was an accountant I'd be mortified of an asset that can fluctuate 40% in a day, that you can only convert to fiat at a couple thousand dollars a day unless you sell them on the street, that can take hours or days to even end up in your bankaccount and that are all in a very very new market. ;)
If I hired an accountant to index my savings for the year and he'd just list my btc in dollars as part of my balance, I'd certainly fire him though.

Well, at least it's not Detroit.
