Jesus, I thought saying "Shooting old people behind a shed" would've been easy enough sarcasm to detect, but I guess the /s is always required...
Actually re-reading it, considering its a libertarian post, I wouldn't be surprised if anyone actually did support letting those who can't 'help' society die.

Damn I played myself

I hate old people anyways, we should just shoot them behind a shed when they turn 65. Useless to society at that point.
Fucking s/ Holy fuck Reddit can't sarcasm at all

Is it possible to buy bundles of Bolivar? Ebay only has 100 stacks for like $50, which if this is just on the street...definitely isn't worth that.

Yeah if I didn't know what Bitcoin was and decided to visit here, I would automatically think it was a scam or cult.

I'm assuming /s? 
Because if I came here to get information, the current top posts are all literally memes [1]( [2]( [3]( about either price breaking, 'HODL till moon', or spending all their money on BTC. And if the only information I had previously recieved about bitcoin was from mainstream media (Stories about people losing everything, it's a scam, etc) and came here? Id be thinking "Oh damn they were right". 
This subreddit is a fucking joke and makes the BTC and crypto community seem like a bunch of man children. Luckily the technology behind BTC is solid enough that I don't think it'll effect it long term.

Sell for USD? No. Use for goods and services? Yes.

What happens to coins of the deceased?

Well, if it makes you feel any better, if nobody had ever sold or used it as a real currency, it would've never gotten to the point it is now.

So how does one "Hold their keys"?

Nah, theres a dispensary in Olympia, Washington called Green Lady that been accepting bitcoin for almost a year now. It was actually my first irl bitcoin exchange.
