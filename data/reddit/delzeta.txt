At this rate, you'll have paid the ransom to the more deserving.

I think you might have fallen for it.

I've always felt like I'm missing out on something. When I first got into bitcoin I kinda set up a full node by accident, and now when people are like "Yeah I'm running a node!" it's just kinda like, "Wait, I can not run a node?" Thanks for your contribution to the network. :)

It doesn't necessarily mean that they haven't been included in a block by a miner, it just means that a block has yet to be mined including their transaction, therefore being unconfirmed.

For all we know, by the time it becomes an issue, mining addresses will actually be practical.
That being said, as others have pointed out, it doesn't particularly matter. The market cap of bitcoin does not depend on the number of active coins, and losing coins only lowers the divisibility.

Well, fair enough. I was not aware of their source of entropy nor the issue.
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:38:14
It's difficult to point fingers, because you should never assume a RNG has proper entropy, but there may have been a guarantee of entropy or no good way to verify entropy, depending on how they generate numbers. I'm not knowledgeable on the intricacies of crypto on Android.

Yay bits!

Real numbers can also be negative, and you didn't provide a reason not to instead use the more directed rational variables q and r.

Market orders are transaction with one participant. Two orders are resolved from the market during a transaction.

I'd be okay with the approach if there was an actual infrastructural problem, but there's not. Pools can already accept or deny transactions based on whatever they want, might as well create specialized nodes for processing transactions in this way. Hell, the whole spam issue would be better if there was nodes that specifically mine transactions only by priority, or even better, only by age. But no, gotta stick to the standards without consideration that solutions are right in front of us.

Miners being upfront about their fees would also fix the whole fees need to go up as mining return goes down. If they were just like "Hey, our minimum fee is this and we prioritize this." then in the long run things will be better.

Strictly speaking, market orders are not transactions, as there must have be a pending order to fill. That is, market orders are no different from a limit order that matches the best existing order. While a market order (usually) guarantees an immediate transaction, it itself is not a transaction.
