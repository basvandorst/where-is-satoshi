It has been removed from the App Store. It doesn't magically stop working, but no one else is able to download it. If you already have it installed, then it will continue to work (as long as no major changes take place by Blockchain like switching databases, etc). There will be no updates to the app, unless they decide to distribute it via Cydia in the future.
There are plenty of Bitcoin apps, but Blockchain was the last wallet app on the store.

I was hoping to get at least 10 people. It looks like Armory only supports up to 7 people, but that is definitely a feature I didn't know about and will look into
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:34:46
Great! Thank you for the suggestion. I don't want to download the app until mine is out. I do not want to subconsciously be influenced by any other design/functionality. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:25:27
I still haven't gone up there since they started accepting Bitcoins. I need to get out there and support them. It's tough waking up early to beat the crowd though.

Just in time for my job search! I was searching for crypto-related jobs and couldn't find anything. Thanks for the app. I'll check it out

They were mentioning him throughout the race and had a mini segment of him pre-race. It was great exposure for the crypto community and he made it up to 4th at one point! First time I watched a full race on TV in 15 years!

I fully expected to be down voted before posting that. It's kind of funny how it's at -5 now and they didn't even bother to up vote your comment. If I get down voted for vocalizing my opinion, so be it. It's only my opinion. 
I wasn't trying to make it into a company A vs company B superiority post. The point that I was trying to make was simply your suggestion of modifying a phone, and the same can be done for certain other phones as well to get features that an individual wants. 
Rooting phone [x] is easy. Mine is rooted. Jailbreaking phone [y] is easy. Mine is jailbroke. I get all the features I need from both phones. I prefer certain things over others for OSes. 
To play into these branding games is childish and exactly what the companies want you to do (not you personally; I'm just generalizing for the overall populace).  I don't need commercials or other people to tell me what I need. I can decide for myself. I know what works for me. And I know I will never own a non-rooted or non-jailbreak phone. Every feature I need will be at my fingertips, and if it's not, then it's app-building time.

When Bitcoin was a lot less and the tipbot was a new thing, Bitcoin people were tipping like crazy too. Maybe not the volume that Dogecoin tips, but it was still a lot more than I see now.
As long as merchants accept Dogecoin (or any other cryptocurrency) as a form of payment for goods/services, it has a real life, practical use. It's not to say that the value of any of these coins won't drop to 0. That's the risk of being in the crypto world. Cryptos are new to the world. It's going to take time to get it mainstream. The easier it becomes to get and use cryptos, the more widespread it will become.
There was plenty of good to come out of the Dot Com bubble. It revolutionized the way we obtain and spread information. Now we are witnessing the revolutionizing of a payment system that can be sent worldwide in minutes with minimum transaction fees.

Oh, so that's the iOS-equivalent of being jailbroken. Good to know he destroyed a perfectly good phone that he could have modded in order to receive another he has to mod to get features not provided originally. My jailbroken iPhone has perfectly fine wallets on it. 
If the user isn't technical enough to click one button to jailbreak an iPhone (seriously, one button with evasi0n), they're gonna have a fuck of a time securing a wallet on Android. I could care less about the android/apple circle jerk. I have both and I'll take my jailbroke iPhone out for a night on the town before I take my S4.

That's actually the definition of a good trader. You double your investment within a week. People invest for years hoping for a 20% return. Good job. No one knew it would explode like this.

Currently, there's a post with 500+ upvotes praising Coinbase for fixing an exploit quickly and giving the user 10BTC for the find. There was no proof presented, but it was still sent to the top.
This post has proof of attempted contact with no response. This needs more attention.

I agree. I may have to look into this myself for next season, but I figured something would have existed by now considering everything is online-based

I beg to differ. I have been a Bitcoin advocate since 2010, and I am able to see the good in Altcoins unlike most Bitcoin "users". Everyone in seems to hate any other cryptocurrency for some reason. 
Dogecoin is bringing cryptocurrencies mainstream to the average person. Even if they "fail" at making people rich, they are doing a damn good job at making the average person aware of cryptocurrencies. 
NASCAR enthusiasts, or what some call rednecks, are subscribing to an internet forum and watching a car do circles sponsoring this foreign concept that they never heard of before. That's a win for everyone and these uptight fuckers need to recognize that it's good for BTC, LTC, DOGE, etc. We're in this together, but elitist fucks are going to ruin a good thing if everyone can't cooperate.
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:33:05
Damn you. I am currently developing an app like this and was hoping to get it out first *sigh*

I haven't gotten much response regarding interest, so if you know of more people that may be interested in a league, let me know. I may try to post one more time and see if I can generate any more interest before the beginning of the season.

So after 6 months of a coin existing and making huge news multiple times, you sell at a low point for a coin that hit its 2-month high. I buy all my coins from people like you. Thank you. Bitcoin has had ups and downs long before it has been in the mainstream news. You sound like you want to be a millionaire off of pennies. Good luck with that 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:29:05
No worries. I asked because I am currently building an app like this and I didn't expect for one to come out before I released mine, so now I need a competitive edge. I was initially only using Coinmap, but now I need to add some more resources. I may need to go back to the drawing board now.
I wasn't sure if one map/website was more accurate than another or something along those lines. Thank you!

[Here's a pretty thorough analysis of his tweets.]( This was during his campaign, but not much has changed.
- Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff).
- Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him).
- Trump’s Android account uses about 40-80% more words related to disgust, sadness, fear, anger, and other “negative” sentiments than the iPhone account does.
- He is a very [active tweeter in the early morning (when this tweet was sent)]( while he gets his daily intel briefings from Fox News.
Obviously you don't know for certain, but it follows the same patterns as before.

Well that blows. Sorry to hear about that. That's bs that they don't inform you as to why they closed your account.

I have auto-buys every week and use my CO360 account for it. I have been using that account for close to 2 years buying Bitcoins and never had an issue with CO360 (ING previously). There is probably more to the story I would assume.

Because people that need Bitcoin (ie Africa which is always mentioned in here) are not getting 10Gbps. Bitcoin needs to cater to the lowest possible technology used by the masses instead of the best technology used by few.

I kept getting them and had no idea how, but this is the first time that adding additional info to my email paid off. 
For the future, most sites filter it, but some don't. When you sign up for something and they ask for email, the following works to track it:
Anything after the plus sign is ignored by email clients. So it still gets delivered to your normal email address and you can track the site it comes from if the site doesn't strip the info. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:05:44
Prob a good call. I never really used them. I just signed up to compare them with nitrogen and after using both, nitrogen was 100x better. I sent out a tweet to them with no response. They're either selling the info or got hacked. Both result in me never using them again and pushing people to nitrogen.

Is this a known scam, or did the other poster think this was legit?
I received this same email last week and got another one today. I decided to dig into it a bit more. I didn't see it mentioned before, so I wanted to make people aware.

I have impatiently been checking about every half hour, but it is not looking good. If Coinbase would verify my bank account, I would switch in a second. I just want any exchange at this point to tank my money. I wish BitFloor never went down. That was quick and easy.

Yup. I've been buying all morning

I have been nervous about sending large amounts in the mail. So I have been holding off for ACH, but it doesn't look promising.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:46:06
Nope it's not. I paid with btc about 6 months ago. And it's a US-based VPN, so I doubt there's much privacy anyways.

I heard it could legitimately be $10k by Christmas. It's easy to say numbers, not so easy to analyze them intelligently and reasons for it. I personally don't see it hitting $100 again, but that's just my personal thoughts with nothing to support it. The easier it becomes to buy and use them and if Amazon or some other huge retailer accepts it, then they will skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:29:24
Wow.. That's pretty awesome. That's my first tip. Thanks a lot man!

It's been saying beta testing for awhile now. I have up on them and have been using coinbase. They have been canceling a lot of my purchases, but at least I am able to get some bitcoins occasionally. It's a pain in the ass to get them
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:44:46
Well that pisses me off. I moved money around in order to do the ACH tomorrow. So I guess the only way I can buy some now is localbitcoins.

It's extremely aggravating that they are putting these dates on their site to only postpone it to a later date.

Did you consider not using Bootstrap and going with a custom design for your site? Bitfloor used bootstrap too, and I was hesitant to sign up through them because of that. As soon as I signed up and deposited money, they shut down.
From my perspective, it's quick to design with Bootstrap (I've used it on some of my sites too), but if I am putting BTC/$$$ into a site, I would hope that it wasn't something that was tossed together overnight. A site can definitely be tossed together over night with Bootstrap templates.
Just a thought...

Finally! Echoing everyone else, thank you so much for the constant communication!
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:04:31
That was enough explanation to give them a shot. I signed up under your referral link! Now hopefully I will get my money back from Bitfloor so I can start buying.

I tried doing that with the Ubuntu Edge, but they failed to reach the $30m campaign. Ubuntu for Android runs off a Android OS, which can't be trusted. The Ubuntu Phone OS is only for Galaxy Nexus or Nexus 4. And Ubuntu has had it's own privacy concerns with recent builds.
Voting with your wallet doesn't do anything if you go to another company doing the same thing.


I still don't understand this. You seem very anti-Apple, but it's all US-based companies for sure. 
Only ~1% of the documents have been released. This is still only the beginning of the spying details. Just because this came out saying that Apple cooperates with the NSA does not mean that no other company does it to the same extent.
I root my Androids and I jailbreak my iPhones to get the functionality I want. And I know using each device that if the NSA wanted information on either one, then ther are going to get that information. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:18:26
This document is also from 10/01/2008. Their budget and authority have only increased since then. I assume that it's remote by now...
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:57:29
Good luck with any other company. They have backdoors to the chip level, encryption level, basically all hardware. So if you think you are better off with another company, you are very naive. Because there has been ZERO evidence of Google and Microsoft working with NSA, right??
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:41:01
I would much rather just send electronic payments instead. The checks/money orders take shipping and physical deposit time. When the ACH date last week was 11/20 and then changed to 11/27, I figured it would still be quicker to wait on the 11/27 date than sending anything. But I guess that was wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:22:30
Congrats! I wish I kept with bitcoin when I first heard of it two years ago, but it was way too confusing for me. I attempted to mine a couple days and only got ~ 1 btc out of it and then quit following it shortly after. If only I kept with it, I would be racing you today! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:07:15
My last deposit was with Dwolla too. Urgh. Coinbase is taking forever to do the bank deposit verification and I just want to buy some more damn Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:35:03
It's not an excuse at all. It's knowing that everything is bugged from OS to actual hardware and it's not limited to one company. If the device you are using is from a US company, it's bugged for the NSA. 
And please explain the "worst of the bunch" comment because I see no evidence of that. Microsoft has backdoors to Skype so the conversations can be streamed for example. Do you think that's limited to Skype?
I have Apple, Microsoft and Google products. They are bugged and backdoored. I use encryption, they have backdoored encryption. I use Linux from components I bought, they have backdoored chips and other hardware. 
The only way for you not to be bugged is to build everything from scratch. The hardware, the software, the network and communications.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:04:00
It took me 3 business days to get my deposit to show up. And it was picked up the night of sending. I'm nervous now. I have USD just sitting in my account (I didn't even get a trade in yet).
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:32:24
I heard the same, BUT my contacts informed me it will drop down to $10 by Friday so people can buy up and then skyrocket to $12k on Jan 2 @ 14:33 EST. Watch for it.
