Bitcoin was 30 cents at some point...
could well be 3.33333333 BTC per dollar.

Such messages could contain addresses etc, private info wich is sortof exactly what we dont want in crypto currency... One of the main points being it's annonymity...
Even if you dont send any somebody may send your address info or even send your info around with unknown payments...
Could lead to all sorts of trouble imo...

I would not trust that website...
The site looks like it's hosted in USA but it's not and the true owner has a hidden location. The website is allso only 12 days old as we speak, and there are no reviews to be found anywhere...
Allso check:
