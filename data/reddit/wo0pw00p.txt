Since you're so curious: 
1) I forgot the login to my other crypto account, I haven't posted here in a while, just lurking.
2) I had BTC in MtGox and I have a claim active.
3) I also used to use BTC-e, and some of my friends still have money stuck there now.
4) I like doing "detective work" and I was the first to post some of these. If I didn't, someone else would.

The person in your link is Alexey. Alexander is the other co-founder.

Lol? It's a twitter link.

You should get that paranoia checked. It's a brand new account because I'd rather keep my main reddit account separate from crypto stuff for obvious reasons.

Some new info about Mt. Gox in here too:
"According to documents, 306,853 bitcoins stolen after the attack on Mt. Gox entered the BTC-e purses ."

Breaking: 
According to this though, it doesn't sound like the guy that was arrested is one of the co-founders of BTC-e. The plot thickens.
