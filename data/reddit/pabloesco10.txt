King is back?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:06:51
With all the FUD over the past month I'd figure we'd be under $10K by now, but it feels like there's a solid floor at $12-13K.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:02
*wake up from 3 month coma*
Oh wow it's about to hit 10K!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:44:00
The only graph on the upswing...the ALTs are crashing even harder.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:47:11
Weird, have never had this issue.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:50
Definitely no coincidence this is happening right before the first CBOE future contracts expire tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:53:42
Would be nice to see a rally between now and the Friday CME contracts expiring.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:11:41
Only seeing one on coinmarketcap that's green over the past 24 hours.
Even then the bigger alts are tanking harder than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:40:19
Any idea what could happen when the futures start expiring later today?
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:08:11
Don't they actually expire 4 PM ET? Not that it seems to matter since people think it expired now and are buying lol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:59:59
Must be, finally got it to work. Now waiting to see how long the transaction takes.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:33
Anyone who has a Ledger wallet having syncing issues? Won't let me send/receive, it's just stuck on syncing.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:00:39
Stock market crash would REALLY shake out everyone in it just for USD profit.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:23:31
It's going to bounce between $10K and $12K for the rest of time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:23
Tough to trust any bounce until 4 PM (when the contracts start to expire), if then. Seems like this volatility is all centered around that.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:34:27
Agree but it's stabilized in this range over the past 2 weeks, which feels like an eternity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:10:51
When they profit off the BCH dump.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:44
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:31:56
Imagine what it'll look like when you can actually exchange BCH/BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:07:16
GDAX goes down for 10 minutes, reopens and the price immediately goes up past $17K.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:42
What are the odds this actually starts trading at 1? Gonna be a bloodbath.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:53:31
*Looks at 3 lines on graph*
It's a whale breaching.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:04
It's almost like you can pinpoint the exact moment people got wind of Coinbase BCH news.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:16
I bought a bunch back the first few months of 2017 and have of course made a healthy profit. Really wanted to wait until 2018 before even considering selling so I get taxed at the long-term capital gain rate. Anyone else torn between locking in some profit now versus waiting for that one year tax benefit?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:19
Why is the BCH/BTC exchange still frozen?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:24:47
Pretty much everything is down except Ripple from the top coins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:13
"Mr. whale, tear down this wall!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:53
The trend is definitely not good, same with the extreme volatility. It needs to stabilize somewhere before I feel like we've truly hit a bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:06:33
Why would they do this instead of locking in for 2018 and deferring the tax payment until 2019? Tax bracket?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:47
Yeah but there'll be a contingent that's waiting until right after the new year to sell. Depends on tax situation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:26:14
Not refuting you. I'm saying if you sell in 2018 you don't have to make tax payments until April 2019 anyway so that leaves you more USD for an extra year to rebuy crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:43
The whales have been spotted.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:41:38
Not in the bitcoin world lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:58:53
Reopened and shot up to $17K
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:43
So from GDAX so far all we can tell is the $4.3K starting price is way too high right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:28
The hell is going on at Coinbase/GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:22
LOL this was similar to my thought during thanksgiving weekend. Sat on my ass for 4 days and made more than 2 months at work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:19
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:35:52
The Koreans are awake :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:02:56
Some massive BCH sell walls forming.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:24:31
Be wary of a year-end sell off for tax purposes, people trying to lock in gains before the new year.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:39:03
Back to $15K! It's been a while.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:48
I hope this happens before Christmas so we get that holiday boost like thanksgiving. Everyone back away from their computers until then!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:28:55
Yep, another big issue. Some hurdles still to clear.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:37:40
Best case scenario so far, not that much movement. Would be more nervous if it swung wildly in either direction.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:52
Even though these might be big USD value swings, remember by percentage this is nothing crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:35
Yeah tough to tell usually it rallies a bit around this time every day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:32:26
Yeah there'll will be people wanting to defer paying taxes until 2019 too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:29
The entire market had to correct a bit at some point. It wasn't gonna be alternating ATHs between BTC and Alts forever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:02:29
Nonzero chance it's true, but you're just making a prediction with no evidence.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:28:05
Lol I meant in the 16 and 17Ks but yeah looks like it's knocking on 18K.
This weekend will be interesting for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:56:42
And they said "minimum one hour". After yesterday who knows how long really.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:43:44
That is some interesting planning. I figure most would want to avoid any tax payments until 2019 so they can reinvest more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:26
Yea, done with them. Just hope they don't do real damage to crypto as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:02
Yeah, obvious insider trading.
Might have to buy some of the other altcoins now if this is gonna be what happens every time one is put on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:16
I think it's a combination of that, people trying to realize gains before 2018 for tax purposes, and the Coinbase/BCH debacle. Then it also created a panic snowball unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:07
In such a volatile market any event could cause a huge swing.
The Coinbase/BCH debacle really shook up everything today I think.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:23
The whales came, saw, and conquered.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:45:38
Nothing between 10 and 20K would surprise me today.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:36
Last night it bounced from $13K to $15K in an hour and I thought it was over. We just need some stability anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:56
Doesn't feel right...
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:48
What's the consensus on any sell-off on January 1 while people wait until the 2018 tax year to trigger gains? Will it be massive? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:44
Anyone able to actually sell BCH at the current price?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:39
true everyone keep buying just in case
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:03
It's getting paused then.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:38
GDAX price was frozen for a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:11
Agree on the tax part, might be rocky ride until after the first week of January. People have significant USD gains to lock in either this year or next depending how they plan it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:17:54
Yes, and remember $1000 swings will happen at this price level.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:37
BTC now near $17K after all this.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:35
I wonder what Korea/Japan do when they start waking up over the next couple of hours.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:14:13
I've mostly avoided exchanging between my BTC, ETH, and LTC shares to avoid triggering short-term gains. Today is one of those days I'm glad i still have all of them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:26:14
Holding steady at 16K to 17K, not a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:22:20
Still bullish but these hacks really need to be curbed somehow. Yes storing in offline wallets is the smart thing to do but 95+% of holders probably don't know anything about that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:19:15
If you got on early on enough and haven't sold, there's a good chance the value right now is a significant part of your net worth.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:31
Really wish I could buy right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:51
Would that drop it below the prices at the other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:57:36
Is it the same whale that keeps setting up these GDAX walls? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:43
I have no idea. I took my coins out of there a few weeks ago it just seems so unreliable for any timely transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:04
Not just bitcoin, I think the shitshow yesterday has damaged people's view of crypto. When insider trading gets suggested, people get skiddish.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:48
This is why the "at least" part should have raised more flags lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:43
This is why I was skeptical when they said they needed a MINIMUM of one hour before they'll allow trading. Gives them an out to delay again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:50:39
Still feels like we're teetering on a cliff. Would love a nice slow climb to $16K over the next couple days.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:20:34
This is the best the 4H chart has looked since December, getting more optimistic.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:39:09
This same type of bounce happened yesterday after a huge fall, not buying it just yet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:28:46
Bought most of my holdings a year ago, don't see any reason to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:03:02
Yeah there have been a lot of those bounces the past 6 weeks so now it's hard to trust any.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:39
That no longer the case?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:29:46
Why was the common sentiment for the bottom $8K. Was it technical analysis of the chart?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:19:52
Sorry to be so loud.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:57
People were saying similar things about Christmas, end of year sell off, futures contracts expiring...none of this is predictable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:57:00
Crypto has crashed like this multiple times over the past several years, difference now is the price is higher and it's getting way more attention.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:13:17
Right this is like the internet back in the '80s/early '90s, the framework is there just need to build on it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:57:22
Even so these bounces are not normal, it feels like some coordinated move.
Hope it holds though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:20
"Shit I thought it was a leap year, screwed up my analysis!"
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:56:17
It's done this after every major fall the 6 weeks, its bounces back up a bit every time. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:32:44
Could just be we're in a bull market again.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:28:58
Awesome that you have that kind of capital to drop but you probably shouldn't share that online.
