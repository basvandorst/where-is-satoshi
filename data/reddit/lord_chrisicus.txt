The more people use crypto, the more it FORCES developers to make improvements. As hype dies, so does the pressure for quick fixes. Timespans lengthen and large jobs lose priority. 
I'll take volatility and insanity over slow development anyday. Let's get it right, now, so that widespread adoption can happen faster. 
Look at LN for example. A few months ago we were told it was not going to be available for a while. Now look at where we are!

I was just hoping to dump and get more BTC. After looking into it, I'm not going to bother lol.

I remember that check sent out by the Bush Administration years ago. Times were tough, gas was almost double what it is now, and most people (myself included) put it right into savings.

It's not a matter of earning. If you invest your money properly, it grows with inflation. A mason jar buried in the back yard won't do this. $100K today will purchase much more than $100K 20 years from now. The goal is really to make sure that your current investments are still valuable in the future. 
There is a reason they say that wealthy people are actually poor. They don't have any *actual* money. They own things that grow over time. See 50 Cent's recent bankruptcy for example. He is by no means broke. He filed because he needed a little more time to cash out some investments so that he would have the fiat to pay with.

I figured out how to manually edit the fee, typed in a number below my transfer total, and it told me it was too low. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:41:40
I want to do this, but how am I supposed to pay my bills? It's either with a card, or a check, and you need a bank account for that. Otherwise I would've done this years ago.

So can I claim any of this with an ethereum wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:30:05
I agree. Hence why I said "crypto" instead of BTC in a majority of my post. I traded some BTC for ETH this morning and had more USD worth. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:37:50
I've got my seatbelt on haha
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:48:59
It doesn't help that we keep printing it too. It drops in value, and we add more to circulation. Supply and demand. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:37:43
Developers can't find bugs if people don't use it. You are correct, but we have to use it before it can be made better. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:26:08
I agree with you. Unless the price drops substantially right after purchase, you don't have to worry about losses. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:34:34
I'll take slow and steady over volatility any day. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:27:51
Downvote me all you want, but I am sick of seeing reckless "investment advice" on this sub. I am all for crypto and BTC, but damn people. Only invest what you are willing to lose. If 50% of his money is disposable, then OK. Go for it. If not, don't. 
We are here to discuss the advancement of a currency that can free us from corporate bullshit. We work so hard for what we have, and you are going against everything we stand for when we **literally tell people how to spend their money**. 
We should be standing up for crypto, the freedom it can give us, and simultaneously helping people to make healthy financial choices. 
To add to this, I feel the mods should be removing any posts that ask if they should buy or not. 
if you feel the need to ask if you should risk spend your money on something, then the answer is no. Plain and simple. There are 2 outcomes here if you do:
1) BTC rises and your investment multiples substantially. You are then set for life. No worries. 
2) BTC falls to nothing and you lose half of the savings you have worked for. You are left with years of wasted efforts and have to start over again. You are stuck paying bank fees because you are not meeting the minimum requirements for your accounts. 
If you want to invest properly, you need to diversify. For example (Not to be taken literally, these are random numbers): Put 10% in real estate, 5% in tech, 15% in bonds, 10% in crypto, etc. Do your research and put in the due diligence. Don't ask Reddit users where to put your money. Only invest higher amounts in areas that you are knowledgeable in. 
If you are OK with the risk, then yes, "Fuck it do it". Do what makes you feel comfortable. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:40:55
The USD drops in value consecutively. You are supposed to save, but not everything. Keeping a healthy savings is important for emergencies, but the rest should be invested in retirement and such. Otherwise, your money depreciates and your hard work is for nothing down the road. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:45:35
I stink they meant "spayed"
Edit: /s
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:48:59
Valid points that I agree with, but I never said anything about overthrowing the government, The Man or the banking system. People are too dumb to survive without control. I'm more referencing the hive mind mentality. "Why is it dropping??! HODLL!!!" is beyond annoying. 
People use PayPal everyday. I like crypto more as a replacement for that, than a secret untraceable currency. The fact that I could buy something overseas and not have to pay exchange rate fees is pretty cool. Crypto fees are lower than PayPal (If you are patient that is). 
Criminals wash paper fiat all the time, so the drug argument is ridiculous. Plus, let's look at why crypto for crime is ridiculous:
As a Buyer: You'd have to send the funds, first, and wait for them to clear before anyone will give you product. They can very easily take your money and ghost on you. 
As a Seller: You would not give people product before receiving payment. People could put a super low fee and you may never get your money. 
Point of sale is out of the question (currently).
I'm also not advising 100% adoption. That'd be cool, but not feasible. I'm just saying that people should use it a little so developers can find things to improve on. If problems or weak points do not show themselves, then nothing can be done about them. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:43:58
Plenty of things have been used for purposes outside of their intent. See sodas, Listerine and Frisbee for example. Just cause the devs tell us NOT to use it the way we want, doesn't mean we have to listen. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:28:52
That spike happened due to media coverage, but to think that it happened BEFORE all of the recent improvements. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:08:18
Here is my question though;
"Will we only be able to trade BTC and ETH during standard Stock Market hours?

So I understand the private key part. But if your wallet is on a hard drive that fails, what does the key do for you? Or is the wallet stored on the block chain? This is what I'm having trouble finding a solid answer for. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:29

Oh wait, Coinbase owns your keys. NVM.

You are talking like this is easy money. Come back to earth for a second and realize that this is a life's savings for most people. I, for example, have a mortgage of $780 a month for a $120K loan. This is substantial for me, and I make a lot more than a majority of people in my age/scenario.

If you had $1000 invested, then the 266-54 drop would've been worse.

I have supported myself from day one. Being an athiest in the southeast is not easy, and I had to carry that secret on my shoulders for a very long time. 
While I was into science, my peers were into trucks and chicken wings. 
I FUCKING REFUSED to shovel shit and work on FUCKING FARM equipment for a living. 
I do not have a degree because I have gone to several schools and found them to be a waste of time. I have not learned a god (yes, lowercased) damned thing from the thousands I have spent on school. 
I had a FUCKING MATH MAJOR ASK ME, yesterday, HOW TALL 59 INCHES WAS. 
**ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!**
Just because you have met a few people online, and had a higher minimum wage in your area, does not mean that the rest of the world is as fortunate as you. 
I have tons of projects in the works. I am a very creative person. Working in an office makes me want to die, but I power through because it is a necessity. 
If you wanted to be generous and pay off my mortgage, I could quit my day job and focus on the side projects I have and help others. 
Otherwise, I will continue to **bust my ass** for 14 hours a day and try to get where I want to be on my own.

Why the price is dropping:
BTC is dropping because it has now outmemed Dodgecoin. It has become the official crypto for memes and is therefore lowering itself to it's now true value. 
I'm not sure if it's my app or not, but it says that this subreddit does not allow text posts.....
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:33:57
Then it must be an area thing. Because in the south east US, when I was 16, minimum wage was $6.15 per hour and there were not any malls. Fast forward a decade and minimum wage is $7.25. Plus, our school system did not teach us JACK SHIT about investing (I doubt yours did too).

We went from riding horses, to trains, to personal automobiles. 
Doesn't quite compare to taking your phone off of your wall and sticking it in your pocket. 
While technology has improved and things have changed, nothing has been big enough to change mankind in a while. Think about the typical office job. You could still do your job without a computer. Hell, you could do the same job today while still using Windows 98. What you couldn't do is travel 40 miles to said office every day without a car. 
The personal automobile was a revolution that has yet to be matched.

Tanking? The media flipped out and everyone jumped on board. We are up $9K in a year. That insane!!! It can drop to $2K and it would still be up 100%. Nasdaq jumped 28% in 2017, and it hasn't done that since 2013 or so. You cant judge the value of BTC off of a media crazed spike over the course of a few weeks. We are still higher than we were (In November) before the news started talking about crypto 24/7.
