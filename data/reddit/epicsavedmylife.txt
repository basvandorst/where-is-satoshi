Wait another year, the longer you know about Bitcoin the more and more obsessed you get. You start to realize everyday just how powerful it is. Eventually not a day will go by that you don’t think about it. Then you become the one trying to tell all your friends about what you’ve “discovered” and the cycle repeats with them. Most of us got in it to “get rich quick” but then you begin to realize it’s much much deeper than that, this is something truly revolutionary.

If you only see it as a store of value token then just buy gold coins instead. Bitcoin is not only a token, it is many things. There are many proposed solutions to the scalability issue.

This argument is just not true. Those who take large risk are either compensated heavily for it or lose a lot. Those people are betting Bitcoin achieves its goal of global reserve currency status at which point they won’t really need to exchange Bitcoin for dollars. The large wealth they’ll have because they invested early is rightfully theirs since they took the risk. Same applies to early investors of amazon etc.... you can’t blame early adopters/hodlers for owning most of Bitcoin when they took the risk and you didn’t due to ignorance. If you believe it has value get in, if not then don’t. This argument isn’t valid as a reason it won’t succeed. And as value increases the incentive for those whales to spend Bitcoin will as well. This thing is 10 years old in what could be 80 years before mass adoption takes place, there’s lots of time for free market distribution via trading Bitcoin for services and goods etc.

He’s not blaming the immigrants, he’s blaming the socialist welfare state responsible for corporate debt and largely incentivizing groups of people to come here both illegally and legally in unsustainable numbers.

He said “for people who don’t want to stay...” nice twist of words though. And he’s not wrong it is a magnet for people to leave their countries behind, most of which are shit holes. Regardless they have the right to go anywhere they like but the problem is an economic issue of incentivizing people to come into a socialist paradise where the welfare state which is the real crime that steals wealth and redistributes it to those who did nothing to earn it.

I seriously can’t believe people are downvoting this on a Bitcoin thread... I thought most Bitcoiners were ancaps or libertarians or at least pro individual freedom but apparently the majority are still political puppets.

I didn’t know this, that’s a shame. I tend to agree with a lot of his views seemed like an honest guy.

I agree. The trust and adoption will continually grow which will aid that market cap growth which has been the story for the last 10 years. Percentage gains will of course diminish however as a function of the increased market cap. As they should, far less risk to enter now than 1 dollar therefore you don’t deserve as big of a reward.

You don’t sell Bitcoins to get rich, you buy them.

Exactly, one global currency. And if I’m not mistaken we are suppose to reach type 1 status by the end of this century.

And what happens when those unskilled workers lose their jobs? Clearly they come here for work but when the job market shrinks due to corporate debt and socialism, those unskilled workers lose their jobs first and run to welfare... fuel gets added to the fire and it’s an exponentially crippling scenario. Not to mention automation will be leaving the vast majority of these workers without jobs in the coming decade reliant on an already bankrupt welfare state. I’ll stop the argument since the lack of economic awareness is mind boggling for a Bitcoin thread.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Stop bailing out banks and stop bailing out people. Take your losses like a fuckin man.

Most people don’t even know what money is. They think it’s a piece of paper that symbolizes debt with unlimited supply. Tell me this, why do the vast majority of ultra high net worth individuals not have that net worth in fiat? They know a little something about money while the poor and middle class get fucked because they’re blind and what would you expect, they were never taught what money and wealth is by design. They still think it’s a savings account and working their lives away to retire at 65 and die three years later not spending any of it. Bitcoin teaches what money is and it’s a masterclass in understanding ‘time as currency’ economics. Once someone discovers Bitcoin they go from “it’s a scam” to “I want to get rich quick” to “this is cool” to “holy fuck this is one of the most powerful creations in humanity” due to the simple fact it’s an absolute game changer to how money works. Change money, change the world.

Anytime someone talks about high fees they’re usually just plebs buying with fiat on Coinbase and it’s the Coinbase fee. Transaction fees themselves are pretty reasonable.
