Thanks bud, great to hear my plan isn't a bad one.
I think I am going to continue buying btc in hope that the "dip" is happening just now. Fingers crossed!

Basically just looking to gain some capitol. Not looking to make money in the short term, it's all for long term plans.

Well this is how it started. I bought my btc originally to buy things, I ended up with 150 spare. Hence I am only now considering putting money in every month. So you now understand why I bought during a bursting bubble lol
I have done some research since making this thread (this thread was a very small part of it.) And I personally believe in bitcoin. New technology is slowly being implemented, the banks are scared and major players like Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Richard Branson (the list goes on) have spoken highly about btc and it's potential. At the end of this month I'm gonna start investing regularly and picking up some of the other cryptos. Let's call it an expensive hobby.

Any reason why? Seems like an okay idea no?

Leaning towards listening to you and u/KewlCryptoTrader. General consensus is to buy what I can afford and hold onto them for a long time, cash out some point down the long and volatile road.

So you believe it will eventually bounce back up?

I have similar thoughts. If bitcoin (or all successful cryptos for that matter) are here to stay then the price will, without doubt, go up. I saw many arguements saying btc is in a bubble (the original reason I was starting to doubt my investment). I believe this might be end up being true if cryptos don't evolve and thus are less likely to stick around.

Subscribed. 
As for the volatility and risk, I am only going to invest what I'm okay with losing. Thanks for the advice bud

Down 79%! I bet that was a bit nerve racking lol
Great to read about other people folllowing a similar plan. If anything, it just makes me feel better to know I'm not alone. The price seems to be climbing very slowly now so I'm planning on buying more asap. I'm very confident the price will reach 15k again, even if it takes a long time.
