I agree with others saying you should be careful with your post history. That amount of btc is almost one days volume of trading on gdax. I'd try and scrub some of your previous posts, and not be so transparent on your posts. 
I'd also be careful about advertising that you have a way that you mentally encrypt everything you write...it can motivate people to try to cause physical harm. 
Once you actually get access to your coins, first thing I would do is move it to a hardware wallet, using a brand new computer that couldn't have been tampered with. I'd probably get multiple hardware wallets and spread the coins across those. 
Then try to find some way to trade it OTC as others have suggested to negotiate transaction fees. I'd probably sell off 5-10 mill worth of coins (assuming you have access to all 8400), and keep the rest in btc. 
 Most importantly, don't let anyone from reddit try to help you personally by asking for access to anything!!! 
I'm sure you already know this though.
Congrats on this amazing, life-changing news!! Seems like it came at a great time for you.

That's a fair point.

doesn't gbtc already allow for retirement money?

some meta deflection there. ive made a bunch of points in which your response is "no it isnt a conflict of interest". "blocks dont need to be larger". The first provides no reasoning, and the 2nd is something i already agree with and have stated multiple times. so youre deflecting on the actual argument and turning this into a big block vs small block debate, which it never started out as.

You can try to reconstruct as suggested using the steps outlined here:

haha thanks for the explanation.

i agree with this. it seems like ppl in this sub wont even admit when theres a clear conflict of interest which is slightly concerning to me. we should at least be in touch with reality here.
It doesn't change my mind that small blocks is the path forward for the reasons you outlined. But I'm not a fan of this incentive structure.

Agreed this is what i find concerning. However core is bigger than just blockstream so that concern is somewhat mitigated. That being said, blockstream devs are some of the most prominent ones on core.

Assuming that you have the private keys then yes, you may be able to access it without the .dat file.

You'll be able to claim long term capital gains. You have plenty of $$ now, no use risking tax fraud.

loll oh god. do you know what a conflict of interest is? they are building out a roadmap of bitcoin -- the incentive should simply be to increase bitcoins value. but now they have another incentive which is to profit off that roadmap by selling sidechains. its obvious to anyone who is willing to look at this rationally without "religious" belief in a particular side.

ive already called this out literally on this comment thread. "However core is bigger than just blockstream so that concern is somewhat mitigated." Love the deflection of the main point though.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:47:30
i explained it pretty clearly in the post. There is a conflict of interest when some of the most prominent developers of bitcoin are motivated to build something that benefits them financially (outside of bitcoins value just going up). 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:54:51
Im not sure why were moving the goalposts here.
I already said I believe in small blocks. What's the purpose of bringing that up? I'm just pointing out a conflict of interest and that i find slightly concerning.

We don't need a block size increase right now. Transactions are going through fine (spam attacks were likely being used before to fill up blocks). 
A block size increase will eventually be necessary, I agree. But its a big change and should be done carefully, and should not be at the behest of a bunch of corporations. If a bunch of companies can change bitcoin that is a scary road to follow. Some might argue that users want the 2x increase as well, which could be true, but given that 2x futures are selling for only 20% of btc, that's one fairly clear signal that users value the current chain.

That doesn't address the point about manipulation.
Also, when the futures market gets bigger than the actual btc market, and the price of bitcoin starts following futures, that doesn't seem like a positive outcome to me.
