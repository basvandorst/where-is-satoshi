Yes, the protocol struggle to scale and has to be improved through second layer solutions. Still, community blaming bad actors to behave is also a strength. No one try to hide that Bitcoin scaling is a protocol issue.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:40:45
The protocol scaling is an important issue that is being addressed through 2L solutions. 
Therefore bad actors have to be pointed out always.

Wow, then I am using a Brainstorm wallet on testnet that works great.

I do not want to lose decentralization to drink coffee. When we can have Coffee and decentralization, great. Till then we have to suffer the trolls, and it is totally ok.

If the toilet is a shit-resistant technology, yes, you can blame the toilet. Governments will bring tones of shit to it if they want to brake it.
So if Coinbase is able to clog the Bitcoin network and there is no decentralized solution, Bitcoin has to be blamed.

I have exactly the same question. How can I update to Segwit without changing my BIP39 passphrase?
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:41:33
I don't feel they use it as synonyms. :/
NS is important for the cryptocurrency and the crypography world. Both apply.

I can see every body asking: "when LN?" "When LN?"...just forgive them, please.

Maybe promising you will "eat your p****" if Bitcoin doesn't reach 500000$ in two months. That would give you lot of credibility in Twitter.

Does running a LN node require a Bitcoin Full Node?
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:35:07
Thanks a lot for such a nice explanation. 
So basically UASF is about updating the user nodes to accept rectangles. So the old consensus rules stay valid from a CS perspective, but without political agreement with some miners that otherwise will stop forever the rectangles.
Now I understand, the key point is to separate social and computer consensus. What keeps Bitcoin as a good store of values is the computer consensus (social one is desirable but not mandatory)

Without "money people" whats all this about? Isolated and small pure cryptoeconomy? "Money people" is an important target where Bitcoin wanted to reach. No "money people" no economy.

I prefer the devs to keep coding better than spending their time correcting tweets. If you want reliable info do not trust Twitter or Reddit and follow the developers work at Github.

Bitcoin is worldwide, super bowl is an USA thing. No one in Asia or Europe cares about it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:08:48
I have only read those hyperoptimistics promises in Twitter or Reddit.
Devs have been always realistic and responsable. LN is very advanced,  but don't trust me, verify by yourself the status:

My only TWO investment strategies:
1. HODL
2. Short a predefined amount X every time the Bitcoin Rollercoaster reach the r/bitcoin front page. (Buy if falling, sell if boosting)
+ bitcoinrollercoaster are the best combination to short: No emotions, no rumors.

hahaha, i made this crappy graph in response to a tweet of the "howMuch" graph that avoided the lightning. Now I see it everywhere. Some designer should do it properly, with the correct proportions, numbers and font sizes. (I am proud I put the lightning paper URL)

Functions of money: Store of value, unit of account, medium of exchange. The three are important. If I cannot have my savings in Bitcoin without huge risk it is not so revolutionary, it is just a fancy Paypal.

"what does not kill you makes you stronger"... Let them make Bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:41:13
This is easy to say in bullish moments. The key is to say it when the price is falling. 
Then is when you have to remember this, dont panic, and buy more from weak hands ;)

Invest part of it in the education of your kids. Is the best you can give them and no bullish/bear market can take it away.

How can I move to a Segwit wallet maintaining my 12 words backup? I really don't want to modify it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:46:49
As a store of value it should. Now I have a "risky investment" in Bitcoin, instead I would like to say "I have savings in Bitcoin". In order to do that it needs to behave like the black hole, that not matter what happens it will swallow it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:12:55
The "unit of account" property of Bitcoin will be the last step as money. After being a "Store of value" and then step by step becoming mainstream as "medium of exchange". So prices in Satoshis will take a while. This new is interesting as "medium of exchange".
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:17:53
Bitcoin theory is amazing. The reality is that it is still a high risk investment. So they are not ignorant, they are just conservative with their money.

Writing my keys on a paper and remove my wallet from the phone can be consider a secure strategy?
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:32:16
So if I have the seed words and remove the Jaxx wallet, in eight years I can use them to restore my btc? Or better to write down the keys?

That's his job. And he does it very good.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:16:40
He also simplified the Internet origin story... Effective talks have to choose between simplification and communication.
There is another video where he talks about Roman Empire inflation... Also simplifing history. Another about the egiptian piramids... a simplification.
This is why he is good, he finds a good equilibrium to communicate.

Increasing BTC stack should be the holder strategy. For a holder the best scenario would be if the FUD makes BTC goes down like hell, so they can change BCC for more BTC. In the long term they will be very happy of such a price drop. BCC, if it survives, will be just an altcoin used to press the BTC 2MB block increase in november, nothing else.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:46:40
No, a hardfork is a message of Huge uncertainty. All cryptocurrencies will drop like hell as money goes away to more traditional markets.
Big Money doesn't want to be in unestable markets.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:53:51
If you disagree with the consensus and decide to create an altcoin, everything in order, good luck. 
But pretending to be Bitcoin out of the consensus is some kind of a "copycat brand attack".

If there would be thousands of these in every city, probably Bitcoin would be already mainstream. 
However, education is far more important than propaganda. If someone does not understand 2 factor authentication or will write his keys in Evernote, maybe he should not jump into Bitcoin.
