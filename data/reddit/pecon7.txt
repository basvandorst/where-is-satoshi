Gilded for this good catch.

Honestly, if you're at all willing to invest in the security; I'd recommend purchasing a hardware wallet. There are a few of them around, I personally bought the 'Ledger Nano' wallet since it was really on the cheap end (but definitely did not sacrifice any security). There are some higher grade ones around with some really neat features too, I'm sure other people could add other hardware wallet recommendations to this.

No, you were definitely responding to me.
That source supports like maybe half your statement at most. '700' still seems to have just been pulled from the air, and 'perfect' clearly isn't justified anywhere. 
The tone of your writing is pretty counterintuitive if your goal is to get people to change their opinions to match yours. Randomly calling people 'kid' and 'loser' is just clear immaturity and sorta is just shooting your own argument since it makes you look not credible.

Sure, you can argue that. But you're using a use case that doesn't really work either. Plenty of people will still use a credit card to pay for their $2 (on a good day) cup of coffee, and at that point the credit card processor disappears away 6 cents at a minimum. Sure, paying with cash will always have the slightly objective advantage of zero wait and zero fees. But as a payment network I believe that bitcoin is still doing just fine.

You're the one trying to convince me, telling me to go research it shouldn't be my problem. If you want to make a believable argument then you should include your sources so people can actually believe you rather than simply disregarding something because it sounds unbelievable.

If you're posting facts, you should cite sources too; your first 'fact' there hardly makes any sense. 
My opinion on Trump is that he's a greedy businessman who has extorted, tricked, and lied to people in order to get where he is. 
Here is a supported fact for you, Trump ran a fake business school to trick people into paying him thousands of dollars.
Personally, I don't feel like a scammer is the sort of person who should run a country.

So you cut his number by a quarter, and you have 5-cent transaction fees.
I don't think anyone who says the fees are outrageous really know what they're talking about. We're in the middle of what is essentially a massive fee spike yet the fees are still significantly lower than virtually any other payment network (disregarding centralized zero-fee networks like Paypal balance transfers).

You also are relaying individual transactions being broadcast through the network.

I have a windows phone, so Copay has thus far been the only decent option on this platform. It might not be Mycelium, but it's still pretty good.

No. The price once bubbled up to a max of just over $1000 a few years ago, but since then it has been a pretty even trend of ~$200-$450. So right now is comparatively pretty expensive.
You can look at the history here:

Stripe's chargeback fee is actually $5 lower. In addition to that, (for most people) disputing with your credit card company is more involved than clicking through the paypal website to dispute a transaction. Plus it lets me accept bitcoin right out of the box.

"Targeted the CIA"
Lulzsec DDoS'd the CIA's public info page. It's amazing what passes as hacking these days.

I like it. Kinda reminds me a bit of BitMit, back when that was a thing. Was sad to see that one go, I may try this platform out once it's released!

MLM's are cancer. Thanks for spreading the word on this one.

This is the real reason to avoid this altcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:36:31
Err, namecoin I believe does this somewhat.

I think it's pretty sane to consider 200,000 transactions per day 'a lot'. So no, he isn't.
However, the entire scalability problem is exactly what is being tackled right now with the bickering between different projects to increase block size limit, implement segwit, etc. If things go smoothly we should be seeing Bitcoin scaling to higher transaction volumes with ease in the near future.

I'm already running a store, but it's been obnoxious trying to keep it online when the application crashes every other day.

If they're saved locally and you still have access to that computer, that's easy then...

I just wish coinbase would allow you to set up google authenticator two factor without needing a phone number. I personally don't have cell phone service right now, because it's become too expensive for me to justify having. Can't use coinbase, I guess.

I disputed a case where a person chargebacked a donation they made to one of my services, and I still got the $20 chargeback fee. Contacted paypal support, said they could probably reverse the fee and would get back to me. Never got back to me.
I use stripe now.

It doesn't matter that the devs don't support it. The people running the bitcoin project must have the interests of the community at heart; and since they refuse to support such a popular, simple compromise, it is clear that the devs simply don't give a shit about us. Forget firing the miners, we need to fire the devs and replace them with people who will actually maintain bitcoin's best interest at heart.

Wasn't trying to imply that upgrading the network is easy, just that there were clear signs of this gridlock far in advance. One line of code changed on the current proposal (2mb block) would have almost certainly made this upgrade fairly quick.
