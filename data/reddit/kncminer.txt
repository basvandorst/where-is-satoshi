Arrived a week too late,  but works better than advertized. It will not achieve positive ROI though. No miner on the market right now will.

Yeah... I don't mind losing a little on it, if that happens. It's an awesome piece of tech, and mining IS quite fun, I have to admit!

Just a thought: if you encrypt the seed, and distribute it, the passphrase will need to be ultra-strong, preferably as strong as the seed itself...

Anyone interested in buying a KNC Jupiter? I've been running it for about a week, it's hashing at about 490-500Gh/s without a hitch. 0.93 firmware. With the new difficulty, it should bring in about 0.9BTC/day.
I'm thinking about selling it because I don't believe it will bring in as much BTC as I paid for it. No point in denying that. Perhaps someone else will be more willing to gamble.
HOWEVER, should anyone be interested, you'll have to pick it up personally, in Norway. I don't want to risk shipping it in fear of it breaking or something. I guess this eliminates 99% of potential buyers, but that's just how it must be. You could pay me in BTC or NOK.
If I reach an agreement with a buyer, I'll point it to your pool of choice immediately after receiving payment, or part of a payment perhaps, whatever makes the most sense.
I will not take less for it than I paid myself.

Oh yes, I'm mining with it. It brings in about 0.9 BTC/day, even after the difficulty jump today. These miners go for more than their original price on eBay, so there are people willing to gamble. After all, anything could happen, I don't *know* that I'm not going to make a profit, I just don't *believe* it right now. And if you're in the market for a miner, there's no better deal around, you'll be mining instantly, since I'll point it to your user at the pool of your choice immediately...
But the local pickup is probably a deal breaker for anyone interested. Oh well, had to gauge the interest one way or another.
