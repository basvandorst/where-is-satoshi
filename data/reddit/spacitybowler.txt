Looks like if I put in 1BTC it would work.  Deposited 1.40 into my account.  Heh I still have work to do with this currency.  Thanks for the help :P

Planetsuzy is a really good forum with links to high quality videos.  You should prolly check it out. ;)

One thing I like more about Europe than the States.  Only one zero!
Coming from an American :P

Fuckin' A, man.
Fixed.  As a stickler for grammar, I should have caught that.
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:42:42
Indeed.  Checked it out again, and that was exactly it.

Agreed.  I didn't want to wait to wire the money because of the fluxing prices.  Luckily I didn't buy because I would have bought at 160 yesterday.

It really sucks to get free electricity and not take advantage of this.  I gotta get on this :P
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:19:23
Excellent.  I shall do that from now on.  Thanks for the input. :)

Thanks for looking out, brotha.

Ahh gotcha on that.  Though when I did try to sell that .01 bitcoin, it said invalid value.  Do you think that I don't have enough?

I thought I was the only one to think of this for him.  What an awesome person. :)

Why thank you so much, kind redditor!  Hopefully one day I will be able to pay it forward tenfold!  Though I did give away some furniture today, so that's a start!
