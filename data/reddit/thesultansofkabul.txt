Yes! I love Stellar Lumens because the transaction is nearly instanteous and the fees are like a millionth of a cent or something ridiculously low like that.

The truth is, the people who've invested in Bitcoin don't really give a shit about the environment as long as the price keeps going up. So no, no one here has thought about the environmental effects.
The majority of the comments here are non answers that either don't at all address the issue or just push off the solution to the vague future.

And can you explain to me why that is without  referring to the immature Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin feud that both subreddits are obsessed about?

Why wouldn't it be a downside? Less options is always a downside.

Opposing viewpoints aren't scams.

It is pretty easy actually, hence why so many people made money off Bitcoin, myself included. The problem is most people don't bother to understand the technology and circumstances surrounding it and they just dump money into Bitcoin because the people before them made money.
I've made pretty good profits just by reading a ton and listening to various perspective on different cryptocurrency subreddits.
I managed to sell before the crash and I currently have a load of altcoins.

Why is this subreddit always filled with shit posts like this? Is jerking each other off while hoping that Bitcoin starts churning out free money again really the best way to manage your investments?  If you're a new investor, stop listening to all those HODL and To the Moon posts and start reading up on what's actually going on and make an informed decision for yourself. That's ultimately how you make money.

The amount of upvotes this post has gotten just goes to show you exactly how many people here don't know absolute shit about anything going on and are here for "free money "

Decided to invest at 5500 after a year of using it to buy stuff, sold at 7200. Feels good man.
I have a lot in alts now that are looking good.

What? This is absolutely in the realm of possibility.

You're playing with fire. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose, especially because crypto is so unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:41:23
Do you have any reasonable argument as to why, or is this just another "I really hope it will" gut feeling that has no ground whatsoever?

This is a fucking joke. If you bother to read his letter you'll realize it pretty easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:45:40
lmao seriously. This guy is insane and quite frankly stupid. I feel sorry for his wife. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:06:58
It's like a cult at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:54:20
This cult rivalry with other cryptocurrencies is probably one of the most retarded and immature things I've witnessed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:55:15
BCH peaked at 2700$
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:46
Precisely. This subreddit is absolute shit right now and it's only making things worse for everyone involved.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:39:01
This is the subreddit now.
