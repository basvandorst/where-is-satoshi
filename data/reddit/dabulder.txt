To be fair, they don't invite banks' electronic system developers either

They're not really outright wrong on their points, we really don't know what the future holds

Well yes but on the other hand, us not burning coal is also wasting available energy if you think about it that way

Well we don't know how many coins are lost. They could be just sitting on a cold wallet growing in value.

I'd probably give more value to your surprise if you didn't copy paste your messages across all threads you've spammed this on and received a callout for not fact checking

You can also turn off wind (which is done at times of high wind speeds for structural safety) and arguably throttle solar depending on your setup.
Solar panel power gain depends on the angle of the sunlight hitting the panel so if your panels are adjustable, you can angle them to balance the network load

Well that's factually [incorrect as of 23 hours ago]( but whatever

Well technically you can't be forced to pay any cash either if your assailant isn't able to find it.
But realistically, if faced with the threat of bodily harm is your wallet worth more than that. 
And more importantly, (I'm assuming you mean taxes when you say government stealing your property) they *can* just arrest you until you agree to pay.

Well yes, it's a symbol for an existing currency. The currency is called "Bitcoin" and that's what the unicode standard says
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:46:41




The reason Bitcoin has any value is because of demand for it. In a case that for instance the US became split off from the rest of the network, demand would plummet when the users realized that any Bitcoin traded inside the US will become a hardforked "shitcoin" as they say, Bitcoin in name only the moment the network is reconnected.

It's bad for people who do not see Bitcoin as a speculative investment token, but want it to operate as a serious currency that can be exchanged for goods and services.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:15:19
To be fair it doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the Bank of Norway either

30% fee per transaction to indefinitely support distribution of copies of that product and any free patches to it, host community and user profiles, screenshot hosting, mod sharing, matchmaking, streaming, game file cloud storage and sync. I don't know, sounds pretty worth it to me

Saying "[site x] should be listed as top search for X" is most likely just going to put your message into instant discard pile to be honest. 
Google does a lot of analytics and algorithm work to decide what order the results for any specific search are, and the order changes from user to user. Fresh users searching for Bitcoin for the first time will for instance get the Wikipedia article for Bitcoin instead of either of those websites. Secondly, bitcoin.org might just not have enough of what is generally called "Search Engine Optimization" to reach top spot naturally. If you find that the .com site is top in your results, it might just mean that your behavioural patterns match what Google thinks means you could be interested in that specific site.

Exchanges aren't nebulous entities. In this case it would be whatever country the exchange is headquartered in.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:46:31
Don't forget people that are trying to push bitcoin as a store of value instead of a medium for truly free as in freedom transactions! Those are the ones who will do the most damage for the adoption of Bitcoin as something you can pay for goods and services with

And you can capture wind and solar energy when you need it. It's about network balance, not requiring the system to be 100% at peak generation at all times.

Gold can be used for industrial uses, for example in electronics manufacturing, in addition from looking pretty in jewelery 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:08:56
Oh okay so because someone wants to use Bitcoin as something that has a specific value and can be transferred between a seller and a buyer for that specific value they're a shill. I've never purchased alternative cryptocurrencies and have not suggested anyone should either, but I guess I'm shilling for the evil market of buying things instead of hodling onto a wallet in a cold single apartment because buying things is bad.
What bothers me about this shit is that everyone is going wild about price fluctuations and thinking that a wildly rising value is a great thing for anyone except investors.

Of course that doesn't prevent bad code from slipping in, like it did back with the Heartbleed incident for OpenSSL

What about possible hard forks in the case that the US gets disconnected from the rest of the internet?
The rest of the global world will keep progressing the blockchain, leading the US-BTC to become separated

Not to mention they "can afford" to be cheaper for end users because they're hemorrhaging money left and right. Uber isn't profitable

Legally, aren't you supposed to not remove your hands from the wheel. In addition doesn't the car pull over and stop if you don't keep your hands on the wheel

You don't need admin rights to install Chrome either

I remember a guy dying like this, and from the logs pulled from the wreckage it was noted that he "kept acknowledging the warnings telling you to keep your hands on your wheel"

For the record, in some countries they do very much watch for keywords in the comment line and if their scanner triggers they get notified and call you for clarification

It's actually really easy to destroy "Bitcoin" assets, by just throwing out private keys to addresses that hold them.
Destroying the *collective* "Bitcoin", slightly more difficult

If Bitcoin is defined by the value of electricity, and the value of electricity is defined by Bitcoin, why would anyone mine Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin would have to be worth more to mine than itself for anyone to mine it for anything but fun or room heating

Not knowing that it was going to be worth anything? Negligible rise in power usage, but more importantly, computer processing time. Time is money as they say, so I used my GPU for things like rendering pretty 3D models instead.

They aren't being targeted because they are Christians, but because they *hurt their children*. I don't know how one defends that.

"Actual" time is actually periodically changed, through [inserting leap seconds]( 
These changes are done by a central committee and are propagated from there so I'm not sure how comparable this analogy can really be viewed as.

In the fenno-scandic area (Norway, Sweden, Finland) one of the major banks runs a service to transfer money directly from one user to another so technically, yes
