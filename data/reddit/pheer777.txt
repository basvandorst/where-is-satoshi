Too bad TA, not to mention basic TA is basically worthless

Resistance lines are for the most part just pretty predictable psychological barriers like 6500 or 7000

I see a lot of skepticism about the $1 million valuation of Bitcoin and how "it'd be larger than the m1 money supply" and stuff like this. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that the amount of hard money in the world is not a very accurate representation of how much actual financial action is going on. 
When you consider the amount of debt that's created through fractional banking and the derivatives market, There's over a quadrillion dollars flowing around the world's financial systems, so btc having a total market cap of $21 trillion doesn't seem that far-fetched.

I kinda doubt it, considering CueCat didn't have the attention of large financial institutions and federal bodies.

What do people think of the recent analysis from Bitcoinist, suggesting that bitcoin will fall to 3000 and reach 160k only in 2023? Their chart just follows the current logarithmic patterns of the past price, but with the constant improvements and acceleration of adoption, I personally think their analysis is selling BTC short (no pun intended)

Yeah I don't see the SEC approving at ETF until there's enough volume that no single whale can realistically cause a fluctuation in the market. That and when institutions start market-making to decrease overall volatility.

One of the worst BTC price graphs I've ever seen

r/ethereum has a pretty professional posting culture

Before I looked at the date I saw that he "placed a market order at $300" I thought damn how did I not see this today

I love how it casually glosses over the BCash debacle

Huh, thanks for letting me know!

The trick that worked for me is that I started with $100, which I don't care at all if I lose, so with every subsequent gain I make, I know that practically a complete loss would still only cost me $100.
Basically I can act with complete detachment from panic, and can do otherwise risky moves with no care.

The sites shutting down from what I gather is from a massive influx of users registering. The selloffs could be a combination of people panicking about the site functionalities and just a general correction. Either way I don't doubt it'll be shooting past 12k any time soon
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:13:49
20k within 5 hours or bust

No, I meant that I'm waiting for the money to transfer from the bank into my joint Coinbase/GDAX account. Mad nerve-racking

You jinxed it lmao

Truly insightful and provactive take on the issue

Are you serious? The market cap is not going to drop to $21 million...

Not sure if anyone here watches The Modern Investor but he has an interesting take that essentially crypto is now 100% an institutional event, and that the prices drop is a coordinated attempt to keep prices low while institutions amass large amounts of coins.

This but at the bottom of every trench and abyss is some cheap bitcoin ready to get snatched
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:33:50
Ive gotten so cavalier about it to the point where I get disappointed if it doesnt correct further, cause then i can't buy more Bitcoin on the cheap. On the other hand it shows the resilience of Bitcoin to bad news so Its good in the long run.

Job openings from people quitting�� 
In reality though, yeah constant improvements are being made. The ones badmouthing crypto are the ones who know they have the most to gain from acquiring now.
