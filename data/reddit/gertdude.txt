Bitcoin is a virtual currency, USD is a fiat currency. They have their differences, but they're both currencies.  
Bitcoin has a built in transaction system, ApplePay is an transaction system using credit (USD).  
This infographic is trying to contrast how accessible the payment systems of Bitcoin and ApplePay are on mobile devices.

I agree, It's not a good argument. I know it sounds crazy, but that's the risk people take when they trade bitcoin online.  
Unless you know of some certification I'm not aware of. (Which would be awesome and would help me sleep better at night)

No way, I had no idea there could be such a concise word to describe this type of talk! I'm adding it to my vocabulary. Thanks! 100bits @_date: 2014-12-05 04:55:09

I was not intending to state that USD  


You are correct and I agree that  


fiat is not bad, most if not all world currencies are fiat. I only added fiat to explain the fact that although USD is commonly called "money" or "currency", it's literally "fiat money" or "fiat currency". Just as Bitcoin could be called "money" or "currency", or literally "crypto money" or "crypto currency"  
Definition of ["Fiat Money"](

I believe it's just reputation
