Send money to an exchange and buy them. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:46:38
How the hell should anybody here know exactly? 
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:47:55
These kind of posts are just so childish. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:57:56
Uhm what did you expect exactly? You buy in and from there on the price just goes up and up?
Also i thought bitcoin is a currency. Aren't you supposed to use it?
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:43:37
1.3k and then you sell your freedom coins back for that dirty slave fiat. The end goal for every bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:53:25
It's called a dump. It usually follows the pump. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:44:07
It's going down? As you clearly can see. 
Don't tell me you didn't consider that a possibility. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:58:46
So you saw these "experts" making outrageous claims and figured out they were wrong. And now you come to a bitcoin sub to ask the 18 year old "experts" here if we will go up again?
Some people simply shouldn't have access to more than 10 bucks. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:55:23
Your crystal ball told you that?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:51:59
Why not?
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:25:50
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:40:11
I bet there is more to this story you're not posting. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:10:02
Isn't bitcoin supposed to be used?
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:25:08
File a dispute. Oh wait. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:27:10
It's affect. And no. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:54:21
Nobody can tell you if it's a good investment. Nobody knows. Nobody can see into the future. Also nobody can tell you if it's a good time to buy. 
Why do you think anybody here could?
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:50:12
How many porn customers own bitcoin? 0.1% maybe?
There's your answer. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:11:38
No, never banned from here. 
Also i doubt i'm the only person who ever used the word statist here. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:44:32
Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:27:04
Guess what the people in this sub will predict?
And your bank account getting hacked? I never heard of such a thing. I also don't see how that's relevant to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:13:44
What exactly are you asking?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:58:16
Please stop with these threads. It makes this place look like a kindergarten. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:35:55
You don't actually believe that, do you?
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:55:32
So how many did you buy yourself? 10? 20? 50 maybe? Easiest money ever. You must be buying like crazy right now?
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:25:49
Why or how exactly?
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:13:02
No, you mean you hate it when they manipulate it to go down. When they manipulate it to go up you are extremely happy. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 09:27:32
Nigeria is about to switch to bitcoin. Right guyz?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:01:57
How many cheap coins are you buying? 10? 50 maybe?
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:59:01
Is this a joke? You use bitcoin but when something goes wrong you want the help from statists to get your money back?
Yes, this has to be a joke. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:50:07
I can't believe every 30 mins someone posts this question. 
Why wouldn't it drop? You can't seriously expect it to just rise and rise some more? There is no real reason for the rise in the first place. And all the more reason for a dump inbetween pumps. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:04:25
I hope you are joking. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:06:34
It's because they come here and see 10 posts on the mainpage where people who own 2 coins tell them to buy buy buy because these coinz are super cheap and we will go to the moon.
