Nobody wanted to start their own BTC-connected project 5 years ago.

I like your idea. Visit coinbase for more support.
I also like that you are ready to spend your time and your money on BTC community.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:11:26
Now you should get drunk my friend.
You should celebrate the beginning of "Bitocin saga" in your life.

Why somebody shoudl wreck pink jetta? It's irrational!
@_date: 2014-06-06 11:29:15
I'm not sure there was a compliment. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:00:26
+1 and it's also wasn't created for speculation (wow currency i mean)
@_date: 2014-06-06 11:50:24
Does it matter how people call it? 
I think that importance of BTC or it's awesomeness wouldn't disappear if somebody will say "virtual" instead of "digital".

Buying drugs for bitcoins - here is a new challenge for BTC community!

Nice. Patrick is well known for his wise speech. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:10:48
Wow. There are much more ATM that i expected to see...
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:23:13
Bitcoin ATM...  This is... epic! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:09:25
Lol. I'm glad that you understand.
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:06:40
That is their fate. Tell a fcking stupid thing without understanding what they talking about. 
And nothing can stop them. Even BTC! 
@_date: 2014-06-06 11:39:14
Thanks for the warning bro. Hope you are fine.
And want to talk about police. Have they rights to find out ip or somehow identify guys who tried to rob you?
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:15:53
+1. It can't be negative intere rate.
Moreover, bankers are too greedy and cunning to waste their own money
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:27:47
Hm. How many countries have BTC ATM turned on? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:08:53
I'm sticking to "magic internet money" and fuck you all.
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:40:02
His words mean nothing. Time will show what they will do with BTC
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:53:27
No it's not. 
Only fools truly believe that reputation and respectability of name is the most important thing. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:21:13
Guys from PIA are sick
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:02:15
I hate this annoying message about "51% day". "50% day". I'm sick of it. Everybody is doing only one thing - repeating this stupid symbols like they know what they talking about...
