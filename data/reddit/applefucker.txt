You've made some great points and I can see how Bitcoin is a great asset for the Internet, and possibly beyond that. Given this though, why is it that people push for non-digital stores to accept Bitcoin, and how is it possibly useful for the everyday consumer? (aside from the debatable advantages over other digital pay mediums, Google Wallet instead of PayPal perhaps) It seems to me that Bitcoin is only useful in rare circumstances for the average user, even if it is groundbreaking in certain areas.

It's not exactly easy to just toss social security away. The life expectancy for the first world is up in the eighties now. Do you expect them to work, taking more jobs off the market, leaving more young people out of work? I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a job where a small percentage of my pay is taken to SS instead of no job at all. Assuming the system continues to work as it has, the people who are paying toward SS now will have support when they reach retirement age. If you've got a better way to go about it, then I'd love to hear it.

I've used it before and I still don't see the improvement over systems like PayPal. Plus, PayPal stores your funds in fiat instead of an ever-changing not-so-often-used currency. Plus, there's no waiting time on transactions and it's secure without jumping through multiple account/address hoops. I would love to love Bitcoin as much as everyone else, I just haven't found a logical explanation as to why it's EVER going to be better than fiat in a non-hypothetical world.

He wasn't the last - JFK also attempted to end the banks' control over the economy/politics, and we all know what happened to him. More specifically, he was trying to deal a major blow to the Fed. [Great video here that explains it better than I can.](

Thanks for the extensive answers. Regarding the global currency stage down the road, assuming we ever reach it, how will the finite amount of mineable coins affect the economy? Will Bitcoin inflate a thousand times over and one mBTC (or what have you) will be worth loads of USD? What happens if one individual/corporation/group thereof hordes a large portion of the wealth, like with the USD currently?

They didn't have a good reason to take the money from the man in OP's story. Putting all the money into Bitcoin isn't going to help you either, they'll just hold you until you comply.
If they want something, they'll get it. That's how the US government works these days. All you can do is hope they don't want something from you.

Sorry to ask, but why? Is there a difference between storing fiat income in a bank instead of transferring it (hence storing it) in BTC? How is it any different than PayPal or a similar system, aside from the volatility associated with Bitcoin compared to fiat?

Free market isn't always a good thing, especially when it's a currency being manipulated and not a good/service. If the manipulation continues, and it likely will considering it's intentionally unregulated by government (and private) entities, Bitcoin will never become the stable "perfect currency" that all of its worshipers promise.

I wasn't trying to compare grapes to a currency, I was pointing out that his/her definition of currency could be applied to pretty much any small object with even a slight value. Grapes were just the first thing that came to my head, considering I had some on my desk.
Bitcoin (and grapes) are closer to a commodity, considering the value of both rise and fall. Canadian Tire money doesn't change its value unless there are special circumstances.

Grapes hold value and can be transferred from person to person easily. Does that make them a currency?
