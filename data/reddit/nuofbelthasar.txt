This seems, in a twisted sense, grey-hat.
If you're good at grabbing and encrypting vulnerable data, why would you renege on selling the decryption keys?  It only hurts your credibility - along with that of *all* hackers in the same space - and ultimately reduces your chance of getting a ransom.
So this hacker just reduced the profitability of ransom-ware.  That's good right?

I think their best choice right now is to be gradually buying Bitcoin while also preparing to launch their own crypto, pegged to the dollar.  It should be basically like Tether, but actually legit and with the ability to control the supply pretty much the way they already do with USD.  And they should set it up so that it's easily swapped, trustlessly, with Bitcoin.
This gives them a great deal of power without rocking the boat as much as full on war with crypto.
But...there's really no easy mechanism for the government to decide to do that right now, so I don't see it happening.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:39:23
I don't buy that.  If the U.S. decides that Bitcoin is illegal, usage in the country will crash to a tiny fraction of what it is now.
And the other countries?  If the U.S. or some other powerful country wanted to pressure most other countries to ban the currency, they have a huge toolbox of options for doing that.
That said, I don't see them trying that before cryptos looks like much more of a threat, and by then, they should have the support of a ton of rather rich individuals who could lobby and sue and what-not to at least delay and probably defeat any legislation or policy decision to ban Bitcoin.

Yes.  But many in the community want a *raw* increase to the block-size limit.  Not the *effective* increase provided by SegWit.
It seems there's a sizable population of anti-SegWit-ers who are afraid that activating SegWit means no further on-chain scaling will be developed (at least in the near future).  Raising the base block-size limit - grabbing the lowest hanging scaling-fruit - could be a show of good faith implying that further near-term on-chain scaling can be agreed upon.

The average user probably shouldn't try storing their own bitcoin.  They're way more likely to screw up than Coinbase is.
And Coinbase was never going to pocket their BCH if it turned out to be valuable at all.
So I don't feel sorry for users who left their coins on Coinbase because they probably made the right call.
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:59:52
I don't know why I kept reading your thread.  I don't know why I'm responding.  Dammit.
1. Segwit increases on-chain transaction throughput.  It is on-chain scaling.
2. Your argument about fees being calculated per-byte is baffling.  If a higher byte-per-transaction ratio is a good thing, then let's just make transactions take up 10x as much space.
3. The effect of supply-vs-demand on price is not linear.  You repeatedly imply that it is.  Knowing the words "supply" and "demand" is not the same as knowing basic economics.
4. Most all of this is moot because the hash difficulty will adjust such that profits from mining are only slightly higher than their costs.
5. Use fewer words.

A) A proportional relationship is a type of linear relationship.  If you imply a proportional relationship, you also imply a linear one.  If I say something is non-linear, I am also saying that it is non-proportional.
B) **Supply and demand are represented by curves**.  You can put the y-intercept where ever you want - and yes a straight line is a type of curve - but they are *still curves*.  As I said, you are presuming a linear relationship between supply and price, and that's simply not how economics works.
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:13:08
That makes some sense to me, especially if the life of an ASIC is determined at least partially by tech-obsolescence.
But otherwise, idle units aren't going to die or progress towards dying, so once the hash-power per dollar plateaus, won't this use-case become viable?
@_date: 2017-01-01 06:24:23
I don't quite follow.
Again, I'm not defending ETH as a store of value - there are a number of reasons to think that it is *not* a store of value.  Not only do contentious hard-forks hurt its reputation as a potential store of value, but on a technical level, it is simply not designed as such.
Ignoring all of that, when you buy Ethereum on any of its chains, you know the percentage of that chain's value that you are buying, and that percentage cannot (generally) go away via a fork.  If I buy 1% of all ETC and ETC immediately forks, I still have 1% of ETC plus 1% of whatever the new (old) chain is called.  If ETC forks immediately before I buy, I still know exactly what % I'm buying of whichever chains I choose to buy from.
In other words, forking does not *directly* effect how Ethereum fucntions as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:00:29
Yeah, literally anyone can conjure a new asset based on your holdings.
A chain split isn't much like a stock split.

They knew that TX malleability was making L2 scaling much harder, so they were against fixing it (though most of them wouldn't say as much).
@_date: 2016-06-09 21:55:56
I did a double take.
The author uses "halvening" several times as if it's the proper term for Bitcoin's halving.
I'm not complaining, it was just surprising to see in an otherwise serious article.
Edit: And, right, "halving" is correct; "halvening" is a neologism from "halving" and "happening," as in M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, "The Happening."
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:02:55
Re: Supply and Demand
When people are competing for a thing with limited supply, what determines who gets it is who is willing to pay for it.  A larger population willing to pay a higher price represents larger demand and drives the price upwards.  A larger population willing to sell at a lower price represents higher supply and drives the price downwards.
In other words, there isn't some entity that divines the price based on how much of a thing is available.  If new supply becomes available, the reason the price goes down is because sellers need to find more buyers.  Maybe there were people who would buy a thing at $10, but not at $20.  If the price suddenly drops from $20 to $10, those people will presumably start buying the thing.  However, there's no reason to expect that there are *twice* as many buyers who will buy at $10 than at $20.  There might be 1000x as many.  There might be zero.
Conversely, if you suddenly need twice as many buyers, there's no telling what price you will need to set to find those buyers.  Maybe you can drop the price by 10% to find them.  Maybe there is literally no price that will double your buyers.
In otherwords, it's non-linear.
Edit: in the context of Bitcoin, if you double transaction throughput, you might find that there are plenty of potential users who would transact with it if only the price were a tiny bit cheaper, so doubling that throughput could potentially nearly double miner tx-fee profits (or drop it to nearly zero).

@_date: 2017-08-26 13:01:25
That seems about right, but I'm betting lawyers will get involved over this since there just isn't enough of a precedent.
In particular, the question of what constitutes the original asset will, if not now, come up in debates about blockchain-based assets.  This time it's already basically established that the chain without the rule change is the "real" chain.
How did / should have the ETC-ETH split get handled?  One chain kept the same rules while the one changed them, and the latter chain wound up with more hashpower, more user acceptance, and more economic value, so it has been presumed to be the original asset.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:20:08
Uh, maybe it was different 15 hours ago, but the top comments right now are mostly pretty reasonable.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:11:30
I think that could only work if the original chain was seen as the new asset rather than the new one.
You can't conjure an additional $600 from 1 BTC and pretend like you already had it.  That new value (when realized) has to be accounted for somehow as far as the IRS is concerned.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:54:49
I set very loose stops the last time it went vertical.  Then I set bids when those were triggered.  Then I sold a bit after the dip - which met my bids - recovered.
I didn't perfectly time the market at all, but I have more BTC than I had before, and got some discretionary income to boot (with only capital gains taxes, even, because I mostly just hold).
I think if you believe in the technology (and I do), holding is great.  But that doesn't mean you can't make some money with conservative strategies that take advantage of especially high volatility.
But, yeah, don't trade on emotion or hyped-up news.  Ever.

Hmm.  Not defending Ethereum's frequent forking here, but that makes no sense.
Yes, you "double" the supply when you fork, but you also double everyone's holdings; everyone gets a "copy" of the holdings they had at time-of-fork on both chains (and therefore continue to own the same percentage of the chains' combined total value as they had before).

* we've had a chance to see how the network functions—both technically and economically—once off-chain scaling is up and running.

My gut tells me to try harder to find evidence and apply critical thinking in situations like these.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:06:58
This is the answer.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:58:04
I *really* like Coinbase.
The negative attitude that a lot of Bitcoiners have had towards them makes sense: the hyper- libertarian / anarchist / etc people who have been drawn to Bitcoin on account of them being hyper- libertarian / anarchist / etc want a decentralized currency unfettered by any legal system, and while Coinbase technically helps with promoting such a system, the company actually does try to be appropriately fettered by the U.S.' and other countries' laws.
So there has been a constant campaign on reddit and elsewhere to smear Coinbase.  And I still really hate that, because Coinbase is almost singularly responsible for Bitcoin's success in the U.S. amongst casual Bitcoin buyers.  I could write at length about all of the things they have done right.  In particular, they have repeatedly made it clear that they approach most of the politicized technical issues very conservatively (something many Bitcoiners don't recognize as being a good thing).
They were at one point in full support of a fork that was doomed for having an off-by-one error.
THEIR DEVS SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT
It's a huge mark against their credibility as a cryptocurrency company that they planned to go forwards with a fork that would have crashed the entire currency's network.  They had months to find the bug.  It would have shown up with a proper simulation.  But they didn't find it.
So as much as I like the company, until they give a full account of what went wrong and how they'll make sure it doesn't go wrong the same way again, I can't really support them.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:03:33
Just look at the price charts from the past 2 years.
Of course, past performance does not guarantee future performance, but at the very least you have to expect crashes every time the price goes up a lot.
If Bitcoin is really going to be the primary cryptocurrency of the future, it's going to become a lot more valuable than $5k per coin.  So if you believe that's where it's going, just hold on to what you have and ignore the price.
Edit: Also this is nothing so far compared to past crashes.  The price went from over $1k to below $400 in a single month at one point.

To be fair, you will always be able to trade currencies cheaper on exchanges thanks to most of the trades being off-chain.

I predict you will panic and sell when the price drops by 50%.
Please only buy if you think the price will be much higher *5 years from now*, not if you think you'll be rich next month.

This is the stuff that won me over from the big-block camp.
There are a bunch of devs who have plans to up the efficiency of the network a ton - primarily through non-protocol changes.  Those changes would allegedly make a block-size increase way less problematic for the decentralization of the network.  I want to give those devs a chance to do that.  I know this progress has been slow, but it's obviously been seriously slowed by our little civil war, so I'm willing to cut them some slack before having people with shadier motives take the reins.

The question turned out to be: "what increment should we use for USD/BTC price change announcements?"
I'm a bit disappointed that that's the question, to be honest, but there it is.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:33:16
Well, yes.  Of course it is.
I'm not saying Ver is an expert, but experts that can't change their beliefs in the face of new evidence don't stay experts very long.

Everytime I get halfway through writing a comment supporting Coinbase, I remember that they almost activated a genuinely, provenly catastrophic fork.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:43:02
You're right; that would be safe.
The danger is if you send to an address that you *don't* control - e.g. an exchange's wallet.

A replay attack is when a transaction on one chain is duplicated on a different chain.  It does not allow you to double-spend.

A U.S. federal ban on Bitcoin wouldn't kill the currency, but it would be absolutely devastating for adoption.
And don't think for a moment that they couldn't ban it in a way that strongly pressured other nations to follow suit.
However, I *think* this administration has no interest in banning Bitcoin, and so by the time the U.S. feels genuinely threatened by it, too many powerful people will be invested in its success, and at that point a ban couldn't gain traction.
@_date: 2016-10-15 05:08:13
Of course I would sell.
I believe in crypto-currency, and I'm confident that the *most important thing* for a crypto is hash-power and usage dominance.
If something like ETC clearly surpasses it, I'll switch most of my holdings there in a heartbeat.
Edit: but otherwise, no.  I would only sell a fraction of my holdings if it mooned.

@_date: 2017-05-15 06:03:55
The whole point I'm making is that it's likely not worth working with the more difficult miners if they won't accept anything short of taking complete control, and...if we can UASF we don't *need* to work with them.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:59:54

@_date: 2017-05-21 23:09:09
I completely agree with that attitude on hard-forks; that's how a hard-fork *should* be executed.  That would be the *ideal* hard-fork.
Something engineering types (myself included) really struggle with is over-valuing the *ideal* to the detriment of the project.

Okcoin BTC/CNY is low for the same reason bitfinex BTC/USD is high.Withdrawal of BTC being disabled on okcoin makes their BTC less valuable.  Withdrawal of USD being disabled on bitfinex makes their USD less valuable.

I think we will find out whether that is true in August (look up "user-activated soft-fork" if that means nothing to you).  I make no prediction as to how that will turn out, but it should be pretty educational.




It's not quite right to say that these can't both be true, but...I sense some cognitive dissonance between these two arguments.


People don't think, "hey, let's make rich people get richer," when they go to Walmart.  They won't think that when choosing which currency to use.


But if only *some* governments put negative pressure on crypto, and crypto does becomes the standard (even if no particular currency becomes the "reserve" currency), those governments and their citizens wind up paying a heavy price for being late to the game.


No disagreement there, but that fading *is* putting a fire under the community to get things rolling again.

He's trusted by a lot of the miners he supplies, he helps spread FUD about segwit, and he doesn't offer a good solution to tx malleability.  Those reasons *alone* make him worth blaming.

Jihan thinks he can wrest control of the Bitcoin *protocol* from open-source development.  He believes getting that control is the best way for him to make money with his operation.
As long as he believes these things and is acting rationally, he will not accept any form of cooperation that does not involve Bitcoin's governance moving into the hands of more compliant devs.
A lot of us have a problem with that.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:07:46
Yep.  And that sucks.
It would be great if we could target every "cause" of murder in a way that made it stop, but sometimes the closest "treatable" proxy we have to the cause of murder is just murderers - regardless of what makes them want to murder.
Edit: And I've gone way off track from where we started.  My thinking is this: murder is already a crime.  If you take a drug that - apart from whatever benefit it gives - makes you want to commit murder and you commit a murder, you're going to jail for murder.  I'd say taking the drug without a damn good reason should be treated as risking other people's lives and be punished accordingly (basically the same as driving drunk).
BUT it should only be made illegal if that's what actually *works* in reducing harm to others.
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:34:48
If some miners decide to behave irrationally to "punish" users, the rational miners just get a bigger piece of the pie after difficulty adjusts.
(and with a PoW change, Bitcoin would still remain secure with a fraction of its current hash-power)

@_date: 2017-07-21 00:50:09
I mean, that's basically what the death-penalty / life-in-prison is for.
Depending on the local culture, murderers are often deemed irredeemably defective as people, so we remove them from society (yes, there's also society's visceral hunger for punishing the wicked, too - but the utilitarian justification for these punishments is that some murderers aren't worth trying to rehabilitate).
If we couldn't come up with a cure for infected murder-zombies, we'd probably otherwise "treat" them with impunity, too.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:15:27
Murder sprees are already a crime, so...

@_date: 2017-05-21 23:26:44
I agree that we should be very resistant to hard-forks.  We absolutely shouldn't get in the habit of executing them on any frequent basis.  I think there should almost always be years between them - and yes, we should try to pack as many pending hard-fork-only features into them as possible.
But the good news is that we've proven how resistant the community is to forking.  We've shown how hard it is to get consensus to make a protocol change.  Provided this resistance continues to exist, there *will* usually be years between hard-forks.  I honesty see there being decades between them before too long.
So in that context, I don't find a fork in the near-future to be that terrifying.
Right now, if executing a less-than-ideal fork after overcoming extreme resistance is the only way to push an invaluable bug-fix - I say go for it.  The positives outweigh the negatives.

I've been watching the bitcoin charts for years now. I thought TA was ridiculous pseudo-science at first, but I've come to accept that some TA rules do seem to work better than 50% of the time - at least with BTC/USD.
I'm sure these rules are somewhat - if not strongly - self-fulfilling; regular traders know them, and they know that other traders know them (etc), and if enough traders are using TA rules, then they will wind up working more often than not.
Edit: I'm not saying this *particular* article is self-prophetic.  It's more than it uses very standard TA that most traders are already aware of.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:39:59
To be honest, the BCC posts there remind me a lot of the UASF posts here.
Don't get me wrong - I think the threat of BIP 148 was instrumental in getting segwit activation as far along as it is, but being confident that it would have forced segwit on its own is almost as foolish as being confident that BCC will supplant BTC.
Edit: FTR, I'm just pulling all my crypto off the exchanges and investing heavily in popcorn.
