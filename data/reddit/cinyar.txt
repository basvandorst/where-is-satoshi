The owner probably acquired thousands of BTC during the first months/years. Why would he (she, it) care about a few BTC?

If satoshi wants to remain anonymous touching addresses indisputably linked to him would be a bad move. If he had a rapper's mindset he'd already have a lit track about being satoshi.

Why should a payment processor be the one to judge who is right and who is wrong? It's YOUR responsibility to check who you are doing business with and it's YOUR responsibility to protect your interests.

most importantly they have to follow the laws of the countries they operate in. US govt puts sanctions on Iran? MS (or any other US based business) can't just ignore that.

exactly the same way tax evasion is handled now. Suspicion because you spend more money than you officially have, snitches, if drugs or other illegal stuff is involved then TLAs and their usual fuckery.

yeah but it's crowded, expensive and kind of a police state.

not just a loan but also security. If my fiat money gets stolen from my bank I'll get it back in most cases. If my crypto gets stolen I'm shit out of luck. There's a reason why people store fiat in banks and not in safes at home.

nah, don't worry about saying you own btc/crypto. Just avoid saying how much just like you do with other financial assets.

You think your local equivalent of IRS won't be interested where did your crypto come from and if you paid taxes on it? The moment a significant amount of people start keeping their money in crypto laws will be passed to regulate it and agencies with interest in your money will keep a close eye on the whole market.

Singapore - 8237 people per square km, Germany - 236 per square km. Even large cities like Berlin or Munich don't come anywhere near that density (4000-4500).


And the biggest national park in Germany is bigger than Singapore.


It's not like it's terrible in Germany

and those are the laws I'm talking about. They will make a central authority, you will be required to register and the law will punish those who don't.

Impose rules on how you can use crypto, where you have to report it, apply taxes on it etc. While regular joes can work around it (breaking laws in the process but too small to fry) businesses can't. Add enough rules and it will be too much of a PITA for a business to accept crypto.
