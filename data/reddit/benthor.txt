Once upon a time, I attended the lecture "Informatik A, Algorithmen" in a medium-sized town in northern Germany.
Small world. Or is it?

Nope, it won't, since there will be a mining-goldrush, which will lead to mining becoming less profitable again. 
Although you might be right for a couple of days until the algorithm self-adjusts

Well, you have to see here that the only form of "volatility" right now is exchange rates going up. So businesses everywhere *want* to buy *into* the system by accepting bitcoin. (I don't have numbers but [the bitcoin trade wiki page]( seems to have exploded in recent weeks)
I agree, we are quite a long way away from a stable currency right now. I also expect some bubbles to burst. But bitcoin has one advantage: It is finite. There are only so many BTCs that can ever exist and this allows for a very stable economy in the long run. Look at gold. The amount of Gold in circulation worldwide is (almost) stable and has been so for quite some time. (There is a reason why many countries used to base their money system on the gold standard, i.e., a fixed exchange rate of their currency to gold bullion.)
Finally, Nerd-trust in the system is largely based on a decent technological foundation, so I feel you worry too much. Unless the technology itself tanks, there will always be programmers or webdesigners willing to do trade in BTC, even if only within their own "small-ish tech-economy". That's enough for me.

I think the built-in deflation creates demand for bitcoins. People who don't wish to engage in active currency trades start offering goods and services in return for bitcoins so they can get some themselves. Think about it. Deflation actually *is* a good way to jumpstart an economy based on a new currency. Everyone wants to participate. And once the exchange-rate waves start to calm down a bit, we can really go ahead and spend whatever we have accumulated. What better way to build trust in a currency system than this?
