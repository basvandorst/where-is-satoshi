Why? Why can't Bitcoin prices be beholden to their own economy?

That would be fucking sweet.

True, but at the point where it's become integrated with Google Wallet, wouldn't the market have already determined how much 1 BC is worth? So, instead of saying, 1 BC = 8.675 USD, 1 BC = Big Mac Meal or 1 BC = a month of Netflix. Do you understand? Then the money is tied to the perceived value we get from spending it, not from comparisons.
Anecdote: I went to England for a week last month, and loved it. I paid $95.45 for £55, which is pretty hefty. But then I purchased dinner for £15. Was the dinner worth almost $30? Probably not, but to everyone native who also ate in the restaurant, and who I interacted with, it was a perfectly normal and reasonable price. Why do I tell you about this? The perception informs how much something costs as much as its relative value to other currencies, if not more (on a day-to-day scale, I mean).

Wow, that's pretty awful. Sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme. Ugh.

Thankfully, LastPass makes it pretty painless to systematically change all passwords, even though I'd newly generated one for Mt. Gox. Just to be safe. :-P

So? That's the way it works with anything downloadable. How is this an argument at all?
