Honestly though possibly politically motivated. The government didn’t decide to appeal. The Canadian guy did, and the reason he was sentenced to death this time around was that additional evidence came to light of him actually being a major player in said smuggling ring. 
Basically he got a light sentence cause they thought he was just a pawn and didn’t want to piss off Canada, but then he appealed and they found out he was a major player... plus they could piss off Canada. 
Bad luck for the dude but I don’t have much sympathy. If you deal drugs in China, you know you are playing with your life.

I understand the skepticism... 
But no seriously. Part of the evidence surfaced in Canada. China isn’t just making this up. This guy is in fact kind of a douchebag.
The fact is this wasn’t done directly because of the souring of relations. It’s terrible that any person will be executed, but this guy really did kind of open his own can of worms.

Yeah but the media is kind of hungry to make that connection. They made a lot of fuss about the teacher that got detained and deported too, but pretty much everyone here knew that it wasn’t related.
I’m not saying that him getting the sentence that he did wasn’t influenced by the Huawei situation, but it’s worth noting his Chinese accomplices were already executed. China regularly sentences drug dealers to death, even foreigners. It may be heavy handed but I don’t know that it’s arbitrary.
