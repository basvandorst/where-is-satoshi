This is just my dumb opinion, but since no one knows how many are "lost," but we do have a definitive maximum of 21,000,00 coins, the ever diminishing supply itself will drive the value of bitcoin up in market cap. Yes, as the years go on, I'm sure through daily trading volume and transaction analysis of the block chain, one may get a good picture of how many "active" coins there are on the market vs those sitting cold.

I heard 78.46% of all statistics are made up on the spot...

Would simply recommend you find a direct line to the person hosting the BTM at this location. These machines are often set up so that if after "x" time you are able to return the funds to your wallet (if this BTM had you first enter your phone number). Had the same issue and my bitcoin came back to my wallet a day or two later.
P.S. HODL!

Bitcoin/blockchain in general will put banks out of business way before your 100 years are up...just saying...

Seems impossible! I work as a carpenter and how the f*ck am I supposed to get my crew to work without a little encouragement! ;)

Except Microsoft accepts Bitcoin. Gates isn't a dummy! He's HODLING too!

I'm thinking you'll put yourself in a nice little paradox situation. Assuming you are going to hodl for years, and many people here are waiting for crypto to tank classical financial institutions, your crypto will be locked away the very day the banks close their doors!

Looks like the guy is pretty invested himself. Worth anyone's while to try and figure this beast of a market out if that's your thing...

Oh, you mean I'm NOT supposed to write it on a post-it and stick it to my Trezor!? ;)

Just saying - if you really had intentions to buy this kind of volume you'd have a better handle on the English language. Invest in a dictionary first

Actually impressed with all the feedback from everyone! I didn't expect as much traffic on this post. Cheers guys! 
Found [this article]( and it's right on point. Effing banks and their FAKE NEWS working against crypto.

This - but more. 
Dumb insight from a home builder with his nose in all the news - and I hodl bitcoin. 
Fiat currencies are inherently flawed today. This never used to be the case before the Great Depression. Banks used to hold the US dollar’s value in sync with that of gold. Additionally, fractional lending did not exist before the Depression in the 20’s. That said, Fiat used to actually have some form of backing. 
After this period - let’s just call my reply an episode of “drunk history” - banks and the Federal Reserve began loaning money at a rate greater than they - the banks - held in their own coffers. Essentially this allowed banks the ability to “print money” in an effort to stimulate the then failing economy. 
At this point in time, we see that banks are inherently insolvent and have continued to be as such since this point in time. If, in theory, everyone went to their bank at the same time, and sold their houses and assets, there wouldn’t be enough money for everyone to hold at once. What exists in the banking system on paper, does not equate to real life tangible cash. 
Back to bitcoin. 
There is a limited supply - like gold. So that right, so long as people hold bitcoin for any purpose, purchase or exchange it will have some inherent value. There will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin in circulation when mining is complete, so as long as there continues to be an interest and people are able to convert fiat assets to bitcoin and visa versa, there will continue to be a market. 
People may argue that because bitcoin is digital, it doesn’t have the same intrinsic or technical value as gold. While you cannot make circuit boards, computer chips or necklaces out of bitcoin, both are traded equally as commodities. 
Lastly, previous reply makes a big point. Bitcoin is decentralized. While the US government is able to control the supply of the dollars it prints, bitcoin is on a fixed calendar and we are all aware as a public as to when there will be a halving, and how many bitcoins are distributed. It’s controlled by math - not politics. 
Unless there is a 51% attack (when one mining pool holds access to the majority of the network) bitcoin is unlikely to crash overnight. It’s got substantial economic backing these days, so the likelihood of everyone pulling their money out at once isn’t practical. 
Just a ramble, hope this helps :)
