I'm not on the same side as you on this.
If you take a look at the archive bitcoinware website there is something they want to show. The context as the BitcoinShow, the demonstration of bitcoinware presence and this show with the table and stuff, a happy guy, look at me I'm with the new kind of hardware I know it and will be able to sale you this soon and the last one the hardware only.
Why to put on the website the photo of an unknown guy with the hardware in this situation. Non sense for a company that want to push his company and show him knowledge and presence.
I'm 99% confident this is the guy we are looking at.
