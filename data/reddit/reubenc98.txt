Could you not just put a sticker over the 950 BTC bit and then leave it into a local computer place and ask them to image it?

Cash ISA's may yield 2%, but there are other ISA products. The LISA, max top up of £4000 per year gets a free 25% top up from the government, cash or S&amp;S. And why are we only going for a cash ISA? If we can risk money in BTC, we can risk money in the market - look index funds. I highly recommend Tim Hale's Smarter Investing. Typically we'd assume 5% market return on an investment over a long period of time., averaging out dips and crashes, eg Vanguard Lifestrategy fund is up 15.5% this year. My point is that these are tried and tested ways of capital preservation. I highly doubt people are willing to place all their money into bitcoin, but crypto can play a valuable part in any well balanced portfolio. There's a much higher change than bitcoin will crash and burn in the next 5 years and never recover than the market will and never recover. I'd even say ever. I'm not knocking bitcoin here, I'm urging people to be sensible with their investments.
You can also choose bonds or a balance to hedge better against a market crash. Take a look at this tool

Check the sidebar. Some bank accounts are giving 5% interest. I believe bankaccountsavings.co.uk has a handy calculator.

Should I offload my Bitcoin cash before segwit activates?
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:26:29
I lost half my BTC in fees trying to balance it and my newly cashed out BCH. Now I've £25. FML.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:49:34
I sold my Bcash while it was this high to buy more bitcoin while it was 'low'. Now the worry is bcash is going to keep going haha.

For larger shops they may get cheaper, especially if they have their own bank, ie Tesco and M&amp;S but your typical small shop will have a 2% charge on the debit/credit facilities. Vendors will take this and adjust their prices accordingly. This is why many shops have a minimum spend, and indeed used to charge say 20p under £10 to use card. However that law has changed and that charge will be illegal newt year.

Without wanting to sound simple, can I just leave my BTC in breadwallet and wait for the dust to settle if this is a fork or whatever?

Visit to see how to help mitigate inflation. Are you taking full advantage of your ISA?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:11:33
That's fair enough but I must ask - if the market fails, like completely and doesn't recover, what are you going to spend BTC on? And how will they be confirmed if the internet companies go down. Gold be a better storage? But fair enough.

If you go into breadwallet settings, then additional settings there is a withdraw bch button.

I'd rather pay off the mortage, be comfortable for the rest of my life and live with a bit of hey I could have had more than hold off and see it crash because of say WW3 or whatever. If it was a 10% chance of a future crash or be comfortable now, I'd take being comfortable.

Why didn't you just buy it and leave it sitting for a long period of time, like an index fund?
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:19:22
Ah... If it makes you feel any better I bought in in December at like £900 then got jitters and withdrew at £700. To find out I couldn't get it back to my bank and only into Amazon vouchers. FML. Gonna put some in again and just leave it. Given you did a lot of trading, any good place to buy/sell? I'm UK based.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:37:19
I paid £0.11 sending it from blockchain.info to Breadwallet.

That's actually who I got stung by. People seem to recommend them, but when I go to add bank account so I can cash out via SEPA it just comes up with their IBAN details. Nowhere for me to put mine to cash out? Also, my bank charges £5 for the SEPA transfer in, is that a good price?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:20:04
Is it worth buying in now and holding to the end of the year? Or is that too risky? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:17:45
I'd be happy to go back to January - it was half the price then!
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:15:25
Jumping in as well. Don't want any hassle, so am I best HODLing till after split then seeing what's up?
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:15:16
I threw £50 into BTC as part of my house savings. If it goes to the moon then excellent! If not, I'll not be too fussed haha

Whenever I buy bitcoin through an exchange I have to send pics of my ID. Even on localbitcoins they want pics of ID. Where you's buying it at standard prices with no ID checks hahah

Wouldn't have a link for the study on point 21?
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:14:33
On mobile indeed, thanks!

The thing is, what will transaction fees be like then? Are you going to pay 0.001 BTC ( $1000) for a fast withdrawal? Or will the fees drop by then? This while Segwit thing is confusing.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:56:46
People only want to use BTC at this stage for small transactions though. If you're buying a large item where the transaction cost is negligible BTC gives you no legal protection like a credit card would. So the fees need to come down or BTC will have to have legal protections attached for purchases by local governments.
