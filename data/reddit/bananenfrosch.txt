At relaunch, if there is USD100 in exchange wallet that means I can withdraw USD100? Last trade was weeks ago.

Can usd withdrawals still be processed?

does manual review mean Greenlane / 5 day lock is irrelevant?

Haven't read the full study yet, but looks like search volume correlates with both upward and downward price action: [Study: Google Searches Can Predict Bitcoin Trading Volume](

Rebit.ph and coins.ph have a lot of cash outlets. I pick one over the other based on rates at the time. Both are trusted. I transact 20-40 BTC in a given week - very fast service and great customer service. I've gotten my money every single time :) The wallet feature gives coins the edge though cause it's super convenient to have everything in one place.

At the moment they only have outlet (lbc) so probably not much uptake yet. But they are working to get more on board (we are partnering with them to provide infra).
That said - I was at the airport buying dinner and I realised I didn't have enough php on me and no ATMs in the departure wing. Would've made a great use case for p2p!

Yes you're right. They list by country to recommend an exchange to buy from. Guess it's targeted at an audience just starting out on bitcoin.

Dropbox or google drive should do the trick

if they were competition then i wouldn't want them to know about this :)

Thanks for your advice. Sending 2000 bits there are a couple of local players here who enable fiat transactions on top of blockchain (rebit and coins). I'm thinking of starting here to replace banking services like checks and wires for B2B transactions. So i gotta get my suppliers and customers on board - these are the middle aged Chinese folks who may or may not know what email is :)
For accepting payments, i can experiment on our retail customers  since they tend to be tech savvy. I like coins for this because they have a hedged wallet, i wont have to think about rates everytime someone pays.

i would like to take advantage of the railway so we don't deal with the volatility. and yes, that would make adoption easier
