That’s what’d happen, let’s be real.

You can overwork any part of a computer, although it probably is harder to wear out a RAM stick.

GPUs and RAM are expensive as fuck right now, and while yes, to be fair, mining isn’t the *main* reason, it’s definitely one of the biggest.

Are you fucking serious? You can’t be serious. People are buying graphics cards en masse-sometimes in batches of 10 or more-solely for Bitcoin mining.

...Enthusiasts have bought wildly overpowered cards for years, this isn’t a new trend.

20% of the current price for a card would probably be 60% of the standard price lmao

I could probably run a VR headset off my RX 470; you don’t need godly parts to do VR. VR on max settings? Yes. Basic VR? Mid-tier cards work just fine.

Yeah, I’m not saying I wouldn’t, but I’d definitely be more skeptical. A miner’s card would almost certainly die out *long* before a retail one.

Oh my God if you could get in on a coin as early as that you’d be fucking loaded

While Lambos are absolutely stunning cars, you can't deny that Teslas have some great aesthetics.

I see posts from this sub every now and then from r/popular, and this is gonna sound really stupid, but how are you all so certain that BC is gonna retain its value? This seems like a massive bubble ready to pop at any time.
