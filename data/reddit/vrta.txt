EDIT: BITCOIN PAYMENTS SHOULD BE RE-ENABLED LATER TODAY. See comments from Got the money. There was some issue with my payment. They say it should work almost instantly like what most others reported in this thread. This might be the reason they took down BTC payment at the moment. 
It is using BitPay and works great. Paid using Mycelium.
Will update this comment when it goes through. 
I'm having the shittiest luck with confirmations tho. Only two blocks mined in the last hour :S
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:06:24
There was a problem with my transaction. That is why they took down Bitcoin option for a day. 
See [here](

I have no idea.

BTW here is the [transaction]( Just need a few more confirmations and we're done.
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:18:26
Ask in It can simply be stated in their Terms of Service, whether they enforce it or not I don't know. Wouldn't risk it with my account as it has a few hundred games in it.

They are using BitPay. You don't need any special account. You can send BTC from any wallet. I used Mycelium from my phone. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:54:54
You do realise that is how Bitcoin works? Not exactly instant. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:06:59
Bitstamp is an European exchange. Based in Slovenia, Lux and UK.
This licence just makes it less likely your bank will refuse you to do business with Bitstamp. 
Too many people think Bitstamp and other exchanges like to complicate/freeze your withdrawal process just because they have nothing better to do than to read hatemail. When in reality it is usually your bank (or some intermediary) that fucks up the process.
@_date: 2016-04-26 08:02:35

@_date: 2016-04-26 07:00:17
Don't recommend that. AFAIK there have been instances when people got their Steam account frozen because they bought games from a different region. As soon as you start logging in from not_russia Steam knows you are trying to screw with them. They can easily block your account or just the game you got cheaper.
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:03:55
I went to bed yestersay, so I couldn't respond earlier. 
Just want to tell you I got the money on Steam, so thanks for the support. Hope today's launch goes smooth.

Yeah. I'm baffled this subreddit isnt swarming with threads like this.
Had to double check that I dindn't fuck something up. :D
And I'm not even using Steam Beta.
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:23:48
1. Why not?
2. It has way lower fees than any other payment option. So it is nice for low payments (1-5$). 
3. It's great for people who don't have credit cards (kids etc).
4. You don't have to give Steam all your information and access to your credit card. Just transfer the needed amount of BTC and you are good to go.
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:49:53
Yeah BitPay confirms transactions from some known merchants instantly. I'm doing it the hard way. Really slow block rate at the moment.
@_date: 2016-04-26 08:08:51
He has issues with his bank. Bitcoin should be ideal for his case.
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:44:01
Next stop 21, then 42 then 100.
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:36:38
That would be wasting companies electricity. Most places would get you fired for that.
Just buy the BTC and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:34:37
I guess you red the frontpage story and want to invest $27 to make $900k.
Sad to tell you it doesn't work like that. You need a time machine.
If you invest 10usd today you might have 10-30 in a year. Or you might freak out and sell when it falls to 8. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:42:26
I use Bitstamp because I'm from Europe and because they are awesome. One of the oldest exchanges and they showed they are in it for the long game when they paid stolen 5mio out of their pocket without any bullshit.

@_date: 2016-01-08 09:13:18
As I read on twitter and here the fee is around 8% but is promised to get lower after they get more data on risk factor. 
You can't expect low fees on CCs because of high fraud risk (stolen CCs) and possibilities of chargebacks.
This way of buying BTC is therefore ment for people that need BTC instantly and are willing to pay 5%+ premium for that reason.
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:09:15
From Twitter: 
"Full EU coverage is expected by the end of the month. Rest of the world in following months."
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:17:27
As mentioned in other threads Bitstamp said on twitter that the rest of the EU countries should be enabled by the end of January, the rest of the world in the following months.
Glad to see all that bloody KYC/AML is finally paying off for them.

Bitstamp only supports 4 countries for now (slovenia, UK, germany and italy).
@_date: 2016-01-06 10:52:21


Which they have been doing for the last two years...

@_date: 2016-01-04 17:08:05
You have to have your account verified. 
It is supposed to work almost instant, but I bet the fee will be big enough for this to only be useful for people that have no other way to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:05:28
Probably the same DDOS that held btc-e down for the last day. Just moved from btc-e to bitstamp. Hope they sort it out soon.
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:37:41
That is simply not true.
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:04:54
Well I don't think it is a coincidence. Probably the same DDOS. Just moved from btc-e to bitstamp. Hope they sort it out soon.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:34:51
As I see it they just want to protect themselfs from bank control. If your only payout option is through a bank then you aren't one bit independant. From this perspective I am glad of this alternative. But I hope I won't need it.
You can also probably evade some taxes with this? Anyone?

When you have a few thousand customers there will always be a few people who are dissatisfied with the experience. They will go to reddit and forums to bitch about it.
Users that are satisfied with their service wont rush to reddit to tell you that.
I have been using gox, btc-e, Kraken, Bitstamp and Polo for quite some time now and I only had problems with gox and btc-e. Kraken had some ddos issues last year but are doing OK this year.
Sure Kraken and Bitstamp are a bitch to verify account because of the KYC/AML, but I trust them with my money. Which I can't say for other three.

Deflation. Your statement nicely shows why deflation is worse than (moderate!) inflation. No one wants to spend any money and the economy just halts.
