Never ever invest what you can’t afford to lose. 
Selling your car to invest in Bitcoin isn’t a smart move.

About one month ago I was experiencing continuous crashes with Kraken and after using it for years I had decided it was time to find a better exchange

If you are okay with the thought that you might lose part of them one day, yes.

I’m mostly trading BTC and LTC to EUR

You might be a tad confused on what Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:17
You shouldn't, you should always buy high and sell low
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:52:00
Just keep in mind to invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:01:30
Hodl and buy more
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:16:22
What exchange would you recommend me?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:22:03
They wouldn’t be able to help you, they don’t own your private keys
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:35:45
Either Coinbase or a Bitcoin Atm

I strongly advise not to keep your bitcoins on an online wallet if you intend on forgetting about your coins, hence you should look for cold storage solutions.
The quickest solution would be a paper wallet which you can put into a safe place where it can lie for years as you forgot about it.

Yes, this will be the worst dump of the history.
Bitcoins value will keep dropping as Chinese trading platforms shut down.

It’s always the right time to buy if you plan on holding

To test what? Your post goes against the community guidelines 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:41:02
If you sell them now you will have a loss, if you hodl you will have a gain when bitcoin goes to the moon

Eating popcorn while watching my Bitcoin losing value...But I don't care I'll hodl till the death
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:23:11
I thought the same, then from $250 the price jumped to $1000 and so on and yup I'm still waiting for BTC to drop to $1
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:03:12
I will hodl and buy more at the same time
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:00:12
I use a debit card on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:07:38
So you let a foreign person accede your computer and your wallet where you had 65 Bitcoins...wow.
I'm sorry but unfortunately there is nothing you can do, I suggest to take this as a lesson for the future and maybe stop playing with Bitcoins or money in general

Personally if I had a separate laptop which I would use only as a storage I'd never connect it to the internet

Wait to buy, it will go lower

Tip note: Remember to generate your wallet offline, delete the browser cache and also if the printer saves the history of your printed files, delete it too.

As far as I know Paypal is the worst method to buy bitcoins as it is a payment which could be easily undone unlikely Bitcoin, hence a lot of people tend to avoid it to protect themselves from being scammed.
However there are some ways, you could try LocalBitcoins, Paxful or virwox but keep in mind that the fees for buying bitcoin using paypal are generally way higher if compared to other payment methods.
Personally I use Virwox the few times I need to buy bitcoins using Paypal but as stated before there are other ways, google is your friend in these situations.

Everyday I run into a post similar to this and I’m seriously bothered because of how dumb this logic is.

It depends on how you wanna buy them, you could either set up an account on some exchange and buy them there using your credit card or buy them from someone through localbitcoins.
Either way you will need a cold storage where  you can store your bitcoin, never leave them on an exchange if you plan on holding them for a long period.
