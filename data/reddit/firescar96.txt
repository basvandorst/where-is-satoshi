If you come to the expo, you're sure to meet him.

Hello, I'm the expo director. Brian Forde is head of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. The DCI pays a few core devs to work on Bitcoin and also sponsors students and researchers to do R&amp;D on bitcoin and other blockchain tech. Last year the DCI launched at the Expo, and has since become something of a better funded older sibling to the MIT Bitcoin Club. There are somethings the club can't do, like sponsor student research, better known at MIT as UROPs, which the DCI is now doing. 
That title is the cheeky one I set when drafting the schedule, I do have a disclaimer on the schedule "Exact times and titles subject to minor change" in case Brian gives me a better one. If you can't come to the expo in person we'll try and get the video online so you can hear Brian explain what the DCI has been doing this past year.
EDIT: Early in the morning Monday I started talking with a few members of the bitcoin club and DCI. The club then had a meeting Tuesday and we decided not to have Brian close. Instead it will be Jeremy Rubin (co-founder of the club, DCI, involved with Scaling Bitcoin Montreal, MIT Bitcoin Project), who's been working pretty hard to contribute to the bitcoin community and a bit more representative of MIT. I updated the website yesterday morning. Thank you OP, for voicing your concerns.
EDIT: I don't agree with many of the statements made here about Brian, under Brian's leadership the DCI has had an increasingly positive impact on R&amp;D on bitcoin and blockchain tech. But, Jeremy has been involved with bitcoin and MIT since before my time and based on his projects can give a better history of previous work and overview some of the current work. I offered to Brian to speak, but after more discussion we switched.

Thus proving your actions are only safe until the government says no. I'm going to look at coin tumblers.

We know when the tech is too good to replace ;)
