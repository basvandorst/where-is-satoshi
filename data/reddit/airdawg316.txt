Rinse and repeat.

There is such a thing as "current" market price.  Why would you pay future prices if you didn't have to?  Clearly, they were trying to get cheap coins.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:22:28
I actually did get my package the second time they sent it. Their communication skills suck though. Good luck. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:30:28
Maybe so. But if you already had a bunch of land, you probably aren't going to overpay for more land. You'd probably try to get cheaper land.

Isn't he literally leaving digital money on the metaphorical table?
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:35:26
I'm in the same boat.  How easy/likely will it be for them to track my transactions and audit me or whatever?
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:09:47
Me too. Refurbished XBOX One.  Under $400 after the discount.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:43:17
Am I too late?
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:45:15
Woohoo! Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:52:12
You need to go to the "Invest" tab and click edit.  Then, divest your money before withdrawing it.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:07:53
Just got a full XBox One Console for under 400 USD using Bitcoin.  So excited.

Want to be best friends?
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:23:06
Did you remember to carry the 1?
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:50:39
Rims too? Or just tires? 
@_date: 2014-01-24 07:45:39
Could it have something to do with Overstock, TigerDirect, and others hurting the value of bitcoin by turning it into USD instantly after they get them?  It seems like that would create more BTC availability. Unless the demand goes up with the supply the price will drop until they reach an equilibrium. Or I may just be talking out of my ass.

I'm on mobile at the moment. When I get to a computer and have a little time, I'll try and break it down little easier for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:41:52
Well, after reading the post through a few more times, I'm not sure I can explain it any better.  You can say they are just speculating, but if you actually read everything, they give evidence for everything they claim as they claim it.  Is there anything in particular you're questioning the validity of?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:26:45
Lol. Du u evn no hau 2 reed? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:16:23
What happened with bitstamp? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:49:11
Didn't work for me, but have an upvote for trying.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:39:52
Also, their is a subreddit called r/bitmarket that someone else may be selling one there.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:16:53
I agree the exchange value would tumble, but then wouldn't a bunch of people just buy it up at a low price quickly (I know I would) and its value would climb up again?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:35:41
I bought 5 Xbox ones. I am willing to sell them in the US. PM if you are interested. I'm asking 650 USD in BTC plus shipping.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:54:04
Any way to do this with excel and use Coinbase prices?
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:10:01
Ah. I didn't go that route.  I risked it and gave them my online banking username and password.  It worked right away.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:03:58
Well, I don't like to brag...
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:02:43
Now that we have his email.  If he uses coinbase, we only need his phone and password to take all his money... Muah-ha-ha-ha-ha.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:14:24
I'm not sure, as I'm rather new to bitcoin. I guess the best way to tell is to see how long they've been a redditor, but I've still seen people get ripped off on there... So maybe just blind faith, like you said.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:01:51
My plan is to set they're money aside in a wallet now, and give it to then on Christmas (hopefully appreciating). I will explain to them what it is and if they aren't interested in keeping it, I can help them buy a real gift card off of gyft.com. If the value does go down by then, I will just give them cash or gift cards and eat it out of my pocket. The point is to get more people interested in something I believe in.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:54:49
Sweet!  I'm going to be rich!

[Link]( for those who don't get it.  
  
TL/DR:  I didn't read it, but it was supposedly the first recorded speculative bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:05:15
I've never used Alien Blue, so I can't really compare it, but I use BaconReader on Android and don't have any qualms. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:15:49
Maybe my question should not have said anyone.  It should have said everyone.  I am not hungry and if I am, I will use my going-down-in-value USD, not bitcoin.  Why would the masses spend their bitcoins?  Sorry that I've repeated a daily trend of stupid question asking.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:46:28
I do. I have separate email addresses for public/private.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:07:03
As someone who can't buy any bitcoins until 9:00 pm cst, I am happy this happened for the short term.  Now if only it would stay at $550 USD until then.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:23:56
Could you maybe post his notecards on here when he's done? I'd like to be able to explain it to all the 50 year old skeptics like they were 9.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:04:00
If Bitcoin is anonymous, how would the IRS even know I bought/earned/sold/spent them?
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:01:12
Fellow noob here.  I just started last week.  I read the [Getting Started]( information on the sidebar to the right of this subreddit and it led me to [Coinbase]( which I feel was a very easy, user-friendly way to buy Bitcoins with my USD.  I found it fairly easy to get involved with.  I hope you change your mind.. for your sake and the sake of the community as a whole.
