We all need to remember that at the end of the day Warren Buffet is a really smart investor who is respected by nearly everyone for his knowledge and opinions. While I disagree with what he says, his words have impact - and people WILL believe him.

You assume rational assumption of causation to effect. Have you ever worked in IT? If people's computers crash they come in and say "FRIGGIN GOOGLE WAS READING MY EMAILS AND DELETED THEM WHERED THEY GO????". You're exactly right in saying that people dont understand protocol, and they wont understand that "gmail" isnt "email.
Lenovo taking money and running away with it is very different than the gmail/protocol example. 
edit: at least MOST people won't see the difference. There will always be people with higher technical expertise - but that's not the majority by a long shot.

Unless they can prove he stole the BTC or allowed it to be stolen with CRIMINAL INTENT, not gonna happen. People incorporate for a reason - just because people are pissed they lost their BTC doesnt change the law. 
Personally i'm still shocked as to how many people just kept their BTC in gox......people smart enough to purchase it surely thought about sending it to an external wallet.

Well....no....But if Gmail suddenly disappeared 10's of millions of people would lose access to email, it would make them trust the protocol less, and would make email much less valuable due to the fact that its user base is significantly reduced.......
