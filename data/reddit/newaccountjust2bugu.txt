Thanks for defending Mike Tyson. It's sad how easy it is to get people to believe Tyson is a "violent rapist" when watching him it's clear how he's a peaceful, thoughtful, reserved individual. People are easily led. It's like all those idiots who think Mohammed was a violent pedophile, when educated people know Mohammed was one of the most peaceful humans to walk the planet.

It's hard to believe he broke up with her. She seems like a real catch who would improve the life of any man she's with.

In my opinion, whether or not one is inclined to leave the Bitcoin/crypto space, it's not a bad idea to publicly announce one is leaving it. It reduces the chance of being persecuted or prosecuted. That's why I left the crypto space months ago.

I don't care what any website *says* its privacy policy is. I only care that they let me sign up over Tor and without asking for an email address (or at least without asking for a non-throwaway email address). Reddit is one of the few websites that fits this criteria. I don't trust Reddit, and I like that I don't have to trust Reddit.

To save others from searching for it, here's the passphrase for the chan:

I use the Tails OS -- see r/tails. It routes all traffic over Tor without me needing to bother with the details.
I keep the blockchain in a directory on a USB stick, along with a tar.gz of the latest Bitcoin Core release. After I boot up and mount the USB stick, I do this:
cp /media/amnesia/BitcoinUSB/bitcoin-v-linux32.tar.gz .
tar xzvf bitcoin-v-linux32.tar.gz
./bitcoin-v/bin/bitcoin-qt -datadir=/media/amnesia/BitcoinUSB/.bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 &amp;
The "-v" in "bitcoin-v" is just the version number, like 0.12.1.
It's very easy and I encourage everyone to run Bitcoin over Tor. There will always be many people who think it's good to violate people's privacy. The least we can do is make it more difficult for them.
Plus, the more people who run Bitcoin over Tor, the less my node stands out.
