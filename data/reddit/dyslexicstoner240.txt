Oh no, personal insults in lieu of good argument. You must be the head of the debate club.
I never said it was altruism; it's a profession. It is a profession that the market needs in order to function.
Yes, I care enough about being sure the proper individuals are blamed and brought to justice. Blaming the individuals that lost money is bullshit and just diverts energy and attention away from the negligent and possibly criminal parties known as Bitfinex and BitGo.

This would kill fungibility, and with it bitcoin itself. Blacklisting needs to be made impossible at the protocol level if bitcoin is to retain its censorship resistance.

I 100% agree that it is up to the individuals and businesses involved whether or not they want to do business with each other; anyone can and should be able to refuse to do business with anyone they want.
I also believe that *fungibility and privacy* are paramount for bitcoin's survival going forward. Allowing the possibility for coins to be blacklisted for any reason whatsoever is extremely dangerous. Why? What if I accepted coins from someone for a product I'm selling and didn't check the history? Now I'm holding coins that someone somewhere wont accept because it's traceable to some crime that happened at some point; this would not only be inconvenient to me, but also dangerous to my privacy and potentially safety. The only solution is building blacklists into wallets, which would turn bitcoin into a government-controlled toy. We could end up with state-mandated blacklists, which could be used to cut anyone off from their funds at any time for any reason. *I cannot overstate how dangerous blacklists are.*
By all means, refuse to do business with criminals; but don't use bitcoin as your tool for gathering evidence that they are *allegedly* linked to a crime. Bitcoin must be made to be private and fungible if it is to remain the people's money.

I understand that the fee market arises due to block capacity. However, it's my understanding that regardless of blocksize the fee increases with tx size and throughput. So, I get that the cost per bit goes down, but even with 20MB blocks there's no evidence that a 20kb would be "close to zero", miners still have to make money. 
Besides, this is clearly bitGo's fault. OP should have been able to broadcast his txn with whatever tiny fee he wished and hope it makes it into a block. Wallets strong-arming the end-user into paying exorbitant fees to miners and then blaming the network is bogus.

During this flat phase, there has been (imo) clear accumulation taking place. It's really fun watching all of the liquidity slowly evaporate, as traders realize the bull is not asleep.

Bitcoin is **completely neutral**.

You're paying for hashrate and security. And don't give me the "artificially high fees" because blocksize is small argument, since you can easily flip it around and say increasing the blocksize (**always at the expense of decentralization**) would create "artificially low fees."

I do not understand what there is to disagree on.
Fungibility = 1 bitcoin is equal to any other bitcoin.
If an exchange or merchant does not know (because it is a technical impossibility) that the coins were stolen at some point in their history, they would accept them with no questions asked. However, if they are able to reject outputs based on historical taint, then *that bitcoin is not equal to all other bitcoin*. It is a direct threat to fungibility in the most basic sense.
As a private individual or business, it is up to you to determine who you do business with. However, at the protocol level, all bitcoin should be equal to and indistinguishable from all other bitcoin in order to protect the fungibility of the tokens.

The point being made is that those private interests should not have the *technical ability* to discriminate based on outputs or address taint. It should be made near-impossible to discern a coin's history in order to protect fungibility.
If you accept a transaction directly from someone online, and then try to use those funds on an exchange, what happens if the exchange denies *you* service due to the history of the coins? That is the threat to fungibility.

You are describing market premiums. This has nothing to do with fungibility.

I explained them as separate because they are separate market forces. Of course more money in circulation can make the price of goods go up. More money isn't required for price inflation to occur though; obviously, less supply of a good will also drive the price of said good up. They are two different market forces that interact with one another.
Right now, we're specifically discussing bitcoin's price being acted upon by monetary inflation, driving it's spot-price down and making things *purchased with* BTC more expensive.

Yep! **And** it's also traded as a speculative investment tool, much like every single useful currency in the world. Fancy.
If a currency or commodity cannot withstand speculative activity, it has no business existing, and rightly dies. I think bitcoin has proven itself extremely resilient over the past few years. 
I think you'll find it interesting that most bitcoin traders I've spoken with are *always increasing* their holdings. Many were shorting bitcoin during the long bear-market, and they took their profits *in bitcoin*. They use their bitcoin to trade other markets on sites like 1broker and simplefx, increasing their holdings even further. This activity takes coins out of circulation, drying up supply, and increasing the value of bitcoin.
There is room for everyone in the bitcoin space. :)

So, I can take my EUR and spent it in the US? Of course not. I can only spent EUR in places that accept EUR. Gold is also accepted as currency in many places, but not Walmart or McDonald's. The same logic applies to BTC: You can only spend it where it's accepted.

I'm not talking about Price Inflation (the thing that makes goods and services more expensive); I'm talking about Monetary Inflation. Monetary inflation occurs when new money finds its way into circulation. The monetary-base of BTC is increasing at a rate of 25 bitcoins every block (~10 minutes). When miners sell these coins on the market, in order to recoup costs, it creates downward pressure on the price, making bitcoin cheaper and picking up some new holders along the way. As the block reward decreases, miners have to sell at a higher price to pay for the same amount of hashing power, creating upwards pressure on the price.
1. Monetary inflation = More money = Cheaper Money
2. Price inflation = Less of that good available = Higher Price
edit: Once all coins are distributed, assuming demand remains the same or increases, monetary deflation (higher price per coin) is inevitable.

@_date: 2015-12-24 18:00:11
It means that we're in the distribution phase, which is paid for by the mining subsidy bringing new coins into the ecosystem. These new coins create inflation in the monetary base, reducing price to a degree until mining power vs spot-price reaches an equilibrium. As the mining subsidy decreases, the inflationary effect (which allowed for a lower price and more new bitcoin holders) diminishes.

If you're using it as an investment, it's absolutely risky. The order-books are thin which can cause the market to be quite volatile. Entering the market at the wrong time, or making silly trades can cost you. However, as the market matures this risk will be mitigated by the added liquidity.
That said, it has many advantages over traditional currency. It's impossible to counterfeit, it's cheap to send any amount of value to anywhere in the world (provided there is an internet connection), it's fast, it's harder to steal than cash (if you're smart about storage), etc.
Personally, I've got a little bit of money invested; but I mostly use it to get a 20% discount when I go to  Starbucks (using coinforcoffee.com). Many merchants, or third-parties are willing to arrange discounts for Bitcoin customers.

If you can get American Express gift cards you can use  You'll still pay over market price; Five dollars for the card, and 3.9% CoinAmp fee. You don't even really have to use your name on the card or the CoinAmp order-form, any name would work.

Maybe not "handcuffed," as you put it, but there is certainly a reason the general population might flock to Bitcoin over some other crypto. If Bitcoin (the network) grows slowly, and more merchants adopt Bitcoin during this growth, then when it comes time to make the mad-dash out of fiat Bitcoin is the obvious choice because of it's already-established acceptance.
@_date: 2014-08-22 15:23:43
Can someone else weigh in on the possibility of this type of "attack?" I understand that as liquidity is added this scenario becomes harder and more expensive, but Bitcoin is still such a youngster.
The volatility of the price is the largest argument I run up against when talking to people about Bitcoin. As such, I can see this as being a viable method for the entities wishing to curtail the adoption of Bitcoin.

Sorry to hear about your misfortunes.
I too have been proudly talking about bitcoin, and my buying habits. I've even pulled up graphs to show my friends how much money I've lost, "look at it fall! LOOK AT IT!" I own my decision to invest. The amount I've invested is non-negligible, but I can still laugh at it because I've not over-exposed myself. It could go to zero, and I'd be miffed at the failure of the experiment, but I would still be financially sound. 
When I invest, I view the money I put in as already spent. It's gone. Losing my job wouldn't make me reconsider my past decisions to buy bitcoin. I'm not dipping into or investing my savings. I'm simply buying novel digital tokens that I think are super neat.

I really care about Bitcoin as a movement; so, obviously I want to own as much as I can.

I want all the Bitcoins.

I appreciate the response, but it really wasn't much money (under ten dollars). To be honest, at the time it didn't even occur to me to open a ticket; in hindsight, that was probably silly. I was just so shocked that not only was the engine capable of reducing me to negative balance, but that there also existed a programmatic check for such a problem in the withdrawal process. If I remember correctly, the error clearly said that the negative balance had to be fixed in order to process any withdraws. This to me implied that they knew the problem existed, and instead of fixing the underlying glitch, they just put a band aid on it and called it good. The whole thing just scared me away from the exchange.

I would love it if Bitcoin were stable. I'd much rather have my funds in BTC than in a bank or hidden in my underwear drawer. BTC is so convenient and secure it's almost too good to be true. Unfortunately, it's a very young unregulated market with thin order books; it's going to be all over the place. It can't be helped. But, this is actually good news! These new lows suck for bagholders, but they also enable the purchasing of more coins for those that are interested in investing.
We're still very young. We're not ready for the average Joe and Jane yet. And we're certainly nowhere near being a decent short-term store of wealth. It's okay though, we just have to give the market time to mature. It's going to be a crazy ride.

Assuming Bitcoin is the money standard, deficit spending isn't possible. I mean, it sort of is, but not in the same way it is today. For example, if the government goes into debt through deficit spending and then says "Hey everyone! We need to pay off some debt! So, since we can't just take your money by force anymore we're gonna need you to send X amount of bitcoin to this address: [Address]. Thanks!"

No. The block size is the maximum file space a "block" of transactions is allowed to take up; the blockchain is made up of these blocks. At the moment blocks are 1 MB each, this limits the number of transactions you can fit inside a block. It has nothing to do with the block reward. :)

Any increase would increase the load on the fully verifying nodes. That's not to say we won't need some sort of an increase at some point. That said, to put it simply: If the majority of bitcoin holders cannot run a fully verifying node on their home internet, with hardware they own, then bitcoin has become too centralized, and will be a shadow of its former self.


Uh, no? Value of the coin is determined by the market, as is adoption; it has literally nothing to do with the decentralization of the network and its nodes.

Mt. Gox was most likely running a fractional reserve long before they turned off withdrawals. The reserves depleting is probably what caused them to halt the execution of withdrawals; whether it was due to internal theft *cough* or incompetence on a grand scale, I can only speculate. Of course, they still allowed users to deposit FIAT while bitcoin withdrawals were disabled, which was the disgusting act that caused me to determine for myself several months ahead of time that they were insolvent.

When a single early adopter cashes out BTC, others buy it. For example, if an early adopter sells 40 BTC to buy something, those BTC are probably purchased by ~10-20+ people; this has the effect of distributing the coins. The bearwhale is a perfect example. It took a lot of people to eat those 30,000 bitcoin, now no single individual has all of those bitcoin in one stash.

You must not have been around during the early Internet. Every mention on TV was basically a jab implying that it was for computer nerds and criminals, followed by something along the lines of: "Why would I ever need email when I have the post office?!"
Bitcoin wallets have improved, and are still improving. Exchanges are easier to use. The technology and protocol are evolving to be easier to use and more robust. Innovations such as OpenBaazar are actually coming to fruition. There is *a lot* of development going on in this space. Just like the Internet, the average person will use it once it becomes easy enough to use and provides them with value they otherwise wouldn't have realized.

If I'm understanding properly: Over time the larger portion of the hashpower would increase the blocksize.

You'd probably have to get a little more creative to guarantee you didn't get any of your original bits back. You could trade your bitcoin for the altcoin-of-the-week, send it to another exchange, sell it for bitcoin there, and then transfer it to your new addresses.

No. They wouldn't be banned or censored. The only time they would be removed from the discussion is if they responded with something like "Yes, this is why everyone should run Classic."  Can you honestly not see the difference?
Personally, I think a 2MB increase would serve Bitcoin well; however, I think SegWit should be rolled out first so that we can collect valuable data on bandwidth savings. It could be that an increase in blocksize is unwarranted in the face of SegWit and LN, and if that's the case then we shouldn't risk forcing a hardfork for no real gains. It could also be that once SegWit and LN are running we'll require more than 2MB blocks. It's an issue that we're collecting information on one step at a time. I also like Peter Tschipper's work on Xtreme Thinblocks; I think it could be useful for bandwidth savings and possibly result in more fully-verifying nodes on the network.

Sure, I concede that it is possible there is money on the sidelines waiting for the resolution of the debate. However, I don't think it would spark an actual *increase in adoption*; though, that is only my personal opinion.
I do not know what the perfect solution to the blocksize problem. I do think there are a lot of good solutions coming down the pipeline from all different angles that expand scalability and preserve decentralization. I find things like SegWit, XTreme Thinblocks, and LN to be great solutions; I'm also not opposed to a reasonable (based on residential bandwidth limits) blocksize limit increase. My primary concern is that bitcoin remains decentralized, and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:25:54
I understand your concern regarding the fee market. With that said, it is currently impossible to make the Bitcoin protocol itself scale to the coveted "visa level" due to *current* residential bandwidth limitations. Blocksize will inevitably be raised, but we must be careful as to not risk some of Bitcoin's main value propositions, primarily decentralization. If we are really shooting for individuals *being their own bank*, then they *must* be able to run a fully-verifying node on hardware and bandwidth they have physical access to. The current state of bandwidth being what it is has spawned alternative solutions, such as payment channels, so that we can handle the volume *now*. As technology and bandwidth evolve, so will our honey badger. We just can't jump the gun on this one.

1. Buy 1 coin when the price is $500
2. Buy 2 coins when the price hits $350
You now have 3 coins, and you spent a total of $1,200. This means that you have paid $400 per coin. We can figure this out by taking the total amount you have put in and dividing it by the total number of coins: 1200/ 3 = 400.

It would be censorship; however, from my understanding that is not what is taking place on It is perfectly fine to discuss ideas, proposals, merits, technical details, etc. The only this that is explicitly disallowed is the *promotion* of alternative implementations that do not have overwhelming consensus. You can discuss those implementation's features, ideas, what you like or dislike about the specific changes an implementation brings to the table, etc. So, instead of promoting a specific alternative version of the bitcoin protocol, we discuss the proposals and changes included within them. The same goes for altcoins; it is not constructive to promote Ethereum here, but it could be constructive to discuss specific ideas and features ETH has that could be beneficial to the bitcoin project.

Of course increased adoption is good. Increasing the blocksize isn't going to *attract* adoption though. A simple increase in the blocksize capacity doesn't really fix our scaling woes, and trends towards increased centralization.
A decrease in adoption due to a price crash or whatever is not increased centralization in any sort of meaningful way. The nodes would be decentralized among the users, and bitcoin would remain censorship resistant.
Bitcoin can handle increased adoption now. If people are getting into bitcoin for the right reasons, they are not going to care about paying a nickel or dime to securely move their money. The alarmist pretending that the sky is falling, or that somehow the blocksize debate is hindering adoption just really gets to me; However, I definitely agree that both sides of this debate are being played.

A few dollars is completely subjective. Only put money in that you can afford to lose. When learning how to transfer coins around from your pc to phone or apps, start with a tiny amount. The great thing about bitcoin is you can transfer any amount you want. 
I have been buying coins since $600. I just kept buying. The lower the price went, the more I bought. Because I did this, I was able to cost-average my position to $285 per coin, even though I started buying way up high.

[Ida May Fuller]( the first person to ever receive a social security check, payed a total of $24.75 into the system; she later received a total of $22,888.92 from the program. Where did that money come from? It came from **newer investors in order to pay the older investors**. It is 100% unsustainable, and a 100% ponzi scheme. Period.
As for the central bank scam: People were promised that their investment into the dollar/yuan/etc was sound, yet the valuation of the currencies continue to plummet long-term. That "missing" value is going into the pockets of the early investors (the banks), while continuing to take money from later "investors" (the peasants).

Perhaps, their goal was simply to divide us; in which case, they have been widely successful. Perhaps there is a larger motive. Maybe the nefarious actors are seeking eventual control over development, through various tactics, driven either by profit or the *need* to control? Either or both sides could be guilty!

value of the transaction in bitcoin. Overall, **transaction fees are set based on market
forces within the bitcoin network**. Miners prioritize transactions based on many different criteria, including fees, and might even process transactions for free under certain
circumstances. Transaction fees affect the processing priority, meaning that a transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next-most–mined block, whereas
a transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed, processed on a best-effort
basis after a few blocks, or not processed at all. Transaction fees are not mandatory, and
transactions without fees might be processed eventually; however, including transaction
fees encourages priority processing.


prioritization has been evolving. At first, transaction fees were fixed and constant across
the network. Gradually, the fee structure has been relaxed so that it may be influenced
by market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume. **The current minimum transaction fee is fixed at 0.0001 bitcoin or a tenth of a milli-bitcoin per kilobyte**,
recently decreased from one milli-bitcoin. Most transactions are less than one kilobyte;
however, those with multiple inputs or outputs can be larger. In future revisions of the
bitcoin protocol, it is expected that wallet applications will use statistical analysis to
calculate the most appropriate fee to attach to a transaction based on the average fees
of recent transactions.


I read chapter eight (again) as well. Your assertion that "Fees should tend to 1 satoshis not to 1 million", is not backed up anywhere in the sources you cited. It's not in the Satoshi Whitepaper. It's not in Andreas Antonopoulos' Mastering Bitcoin. It's simply *bullshit*. Stop spreading bullshit.

It cannot be fully priced in until the event, as the market does not know what future demand looks like. So, while the supply of new coins will be cut in half, any estimation as to demand is only a best guess. 
Then there is psychology. Everyone knows the halving is coming. A lot of people expect a price rise. Those that speculate that the halving is priced in will still buy-in if the price begins drifting upwards, which will force it further upwards. Also, there are "whales" with enough resources to capitalize on the market's anticipation of this event; these whales could create the appearance of scarcity during the time of the halving, causing a mania in the market, and sparking another bubble.
Therefore, it is reasonable (imo) to anticipate a rise in price around the time of the halving; The only thing yet to be seen is whether it's a sustainable price rise, or a temporary bubble caused by psychology. :)

 &gt; current policy determined by core developers voting on github
The current core dev policy is: **not changing the policy**.
Decentralized solutions like sidechains, SegWit, LN, etc. are way more simple, more effective, and involves way less risk. They also don't change the key components of bitcoin, and actually maximize decentralization, making it possible for bitcoin to remain censorship-resistant and stateless.
If it were Core Devs proposing crap like XT or Classic, I'd jump ship; however, as it stands, the Core team are the only ones that have the best interest of bitcoin in mind. This is plain to see for anyone with the technical knowledge.

We should realize that there is no scaling emergency, and that the adoption curve is still very healthy. Miners aren't the only driving force, nodes can and will reject any block that miners create that are invalid according to the rules of the node; this is a feature designed to enforce consensus. Instead of fighting with one another we should set differences aside and wait until a BIP comes along that 95% of nodes and miners *agree* on.
The way the community has been divided and one camp set against the other just reeks of a PsyOp; psyops are designed to be unresolvable due to the fact that both sides reject the other as not having anything valid to bring to the table. Its sole purpose is to divide and conquer.

Gold is a commodity, not a program. There are programs that are trading gold derivatives (paper gold, not real gold), which has suppressed the actual spot price of physical gold; *when* the derivative contracts unravel, physical gold will likely increase in value, which is why banks and governments are buying it up while it's cheap.

**B**itcoin = The protocol. The settlement layer.

Competing secondary layers = How **B**itcoin scales in order to accommodate large volumes of **b**itcoin transactions.
Edit: It's important to remember that the secondary layers do not in any way prohibit people from interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain directly; It's just that there will necessarily be a higher cost to do so.

Certainly. Most people that buy bitcoin aren't doing it to spend at Starbucks, they're doing it as a store of value (like gold). Most gold just sits there, gaining value over time. High txn fees are not going to dissuade newbies, only us old timers that remember the cheap fees.

This is also precisely why we need some sort of decentralized on-ramp to the bitcoin economy. When national pressures start blocking access to centralized exchanges, how does bitcoin survive?

As a day/night trader, and someone that uses on-chain transactions several times daily, I can tell you the network is chugging along just as smoothly as ever. Claiming any sort of technical urgency is disingenuous *at best*. Simply pay your four or five cents and the transaction usually makes it into the first block. **Stop spreading your nonsensical and downright irresponsible FUD.** SegWit and lightning will arrive soon enough, and the network will be better off for it. If it is determined that an increase in blocksize is necessary *after* SegWit and LN are released, and the data assessed, then we'll cross that bridge. Again, there is absolutely no emergency; taking the time to scale properly, while preserving all the things that make bitcoin great, is the only responsible way forward.

It wasn't Ethereum that fucked up, it was the DAO contract. Ethereum's devs should do absolutely nothing with regard to the DAO hack. I'd have a different stance if it was a protocol-breaking bug found in Ethereum itself; of course you'd want to roll it back and fix the bug. Modifying/rolling back the blockchain because of an exploitable contract sets a *very bad* precedent.

While it makes sense to consider historic support and resistance levels when analyzing, it's not all about past performance. Generally speaking, when certain things are taking place in a market, it is reflected in various ways in the charts and trailing indicators. Consolidation/distribution triangles (pennants), double tops, double bottoms, consolidation/distribution flags, are all things that occur organically during the price-discovery process. Learning to recognize these signals from the market is key to trading.
When the price is bouncing back and forth in a pennant or flag, it presents a great opportunity to ride the waves; it is also very risky because often times (*not all the time*) it is difficult to tell which way a pennant or flag is going to resolve, and being on the wrong side can be expensive. :)

Agreed. If the shit hit the fan hard enough, your gold and silver reserves would likely be fairly useless for a while. That said, human beings tend to organize and divvy up labor; this is especially true after a catastrophe. Once your surrounding community began to operate as a collective again, they would likely resort to barter in the short-term, but eventually would require a medium of exchange to grow the overall productivity of the community. This is where your gold and silver comes in; until then, your gold and silver should be hidden and secret.

As said, you'll need a wallet on your phone for them to send the coins to. I'd like to add: try to meet up in a public place that you can hang out in for about ten minutes after the transaction (a coffee shop perhaps); this is because it takes ~10 minutes for the bitcoin network to "confirm" the transfer of the funds. Once your wallet indicates that the transaction has a confirmation, you're fully in possession of the purchased coins; and those coins aren't moving without your expressed permission. The risk of not waiting for a confirmation is minimal, but it's strongly advised that you wait for the network to confirm the transfer (especially where large sums of money are involved) to avoid tricksters.
Welcome to the future of finance! Once you get the hang of it, you'll be hooked. :)
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:00:42
and I agree with you both. Gold and silver would not be in high demand in the beginning of a "lights out" scenario. It would be every-person-for-themselves to start; it would take an unknowable amount of time before the dust settled and society began to rebuild on a community-level. At the moment of reorginazation, your gold and silver would likely be in demand; a thriving economy will demand a simple meduim of exchange, and historically, people have turned to gold and silver.  
As one of you points out: without rifles and bullets (or a means to guard), you will be soon parted with your gold and silver. This is painfully true. The only way to keep your gold and silver in the absence of strong defense is secrecy. Absolutely no one should know you have it, and it should be well hidden (this is true in peace time, too).
Of course, I'm not advocating hoarding gold and silver and being ill-prepared otherwise.  Anyone wanting to plan for such a turbulent future would do well to stockpile everything mentioned in this discussion and much more (first aid, medicine, seeds, etc).

I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money. No one can tell you what the price will be a week from now. However, I will make the suggestion that if you do decide to get bitcoin, try your best not to go all-in at once; cost averaging your position is the best way to avoid getting too burned by the volatility of this market.
In case you don't know: Cost averaging is the process of buying small amounts as price moves. If you bought a a coin at $536 and it takes a big fall down to $500 you could buy another one, and your average would be $518 per coin; meaning it only has to go back up to 518 in order for you to break even (as opposed to $536). This method primarily insulates you somewhat from realizing big losses on falls; that said, if the price continues to climb and you've cost-averaged during the rise, you will end up with less overall bitcoin, but the average price you paid will likely be lower than the current price, again insulating you from losses.

Again, why? Why believe him without hard data? I would venture a guess that there is no significant "migration" to alts. There is no alt-coin that even competes on the same level as bitcoin. Smart people trade alts to grow their bitcoin stack, not the other way around. If bitcoin was bleeding out into alts, I assure you the price would not be rising and market cap would not be growing.

Bigger blocks = more transactions inside that block = more fees. 
If I, as a miner, can inflate block sizes to the point that my competition cannot keep up and has to leave the game, it doesn't matter if the tx fees are reduced due to larger blocks, because I get a larger portion of the pie. A bigger piece of the pie is the reason.

I was somewhat in the same boat as you, thinking that nothing was driving price other than speculation. Then I decided to look into the "dark net" to see what all the hubbub was about. Friend, I am here to tell you that there is significant bitcoin demand, for real-world reasons. I personally may have no use for dark net services or products, but there are apparently a whole slew of people that do. Sure, the price is definitely driven primarily by speculative traders, and it trades like an illiquid penny stock, but there is real demand because bitcoin solves real problems for real people.

This whole thing reeks of fear-mongering propaganda with an agenda of a hostile takeover. 
If a real consensus isn't reached by the time the issue is *truly urgent* then then we should use the nuclear option.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:36:24

@_date: 2015-08-22 16:03:55
I see what you're getting at. But you must admit, having to go through such extreme measures to kick a monopolist out should never have to happen in the first place. The monopolist should have never been able to attain such a position; it would be the rules of the protocol itself that failed in that case.
Since we're not even really running up against the 1 MB cap (unless the network is being ~~tested~~ attacked). Simply allowing the blocksize to increase over time to around 100 MB would theoretically allow enough time to get the lightning network, sidechains, and whatever else we've not thought of yet, working.
I don't see a reason in the short-to-long term for a BIP that goes so far to allow the blocksize to exceed 100 MB; and it just seems wildly dangerous to do so.
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:49:14
This is extremely dangerous, and could end up with blocksizes orders of magnitude larger than those proposed by BIP101. The largest miners will *always* vote to increase the blocksize by the maximum amount, as it is in their best interest; however, this is very bad for decentralization.
I'm in favor of raising the explicit 32 MB cap to around ~100 MB and letting it fly for a few years. The amount of potential threat of centralization is drastically reduced. If we do not have real scaling solutions by the time we're sitting around 80 MB, it will be time to raise the limit again. At least we'll be years down the road, and better informed about the state of technology.
We do not need to fear hard-forks; hard-forks will happen, it's okay. What we do need to fear is what we allow to be introduced into the protocol that we may not be able to undo later.
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:17:38
This whole idea that we can implement an extremely high limit and then just soft-fork if it gets out of control is **wrong**. Big miners in the game will *never* be in favor of reducing the blocksize; it is against their financial incentive to do so. 
We have to be careful just how large we allow the blocks to get. Once we let this cat out of the bag, the miners won't let us put it back in.
Bitcoin needs to be given some grow-room. So, let's do that. An explicit cap of around 100 Megs will allow time for real scalability options to be fleshed out. What people seem to ignore is: even with 8 Gig blocks, the protocol cannot scale to the global "morning coffee" currency. We will need secondary layers, regardless. 
The larger we allow blocksizes to get, the more centrally controlled your coins become.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:55:28
I agree that it is likely fake. That said, if it were Satoshi, it stands to reason that he wouldn't want to invoke an appeal to authority. He'd want the experiment to stand on its own.

This is a false narrative. There's no evidence that we'll ever require 8 GB blocks. What if BIP101 is implemented, and during this time other scalability options become viable, and we're left with a growing blocksize and less demand for space within blocks? Transactions would be too cheap and miners would lose incentive, reducing the security of the chain and increasing centralization. 
There's a reason the *vast majority* of developers are urging extreme caution.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:52:12

*Someone please correct me if I'm misunderstanding.*

       ^                       ^
       |     we drop these     |
now the 60% (E) is the new  100%:
    | (C) 20%  |   (F) 60%   | (D) 20% |
For a decrease to take place either:
1. The lower 20% (A) and the next 20% (C) must vote to decrease it. This is effectively 40%.
2. Or, somehow the 20% that matters (C) votes to decrease it on its own. This is the 21% attack.
If this is the case, maybe it should be a requirement for both A + C (&gt;= 40%) to vote for a decrease.

Honestly, I'm not concerned with sides or being on the winning one. My only motive is the preservation of decentralization.

That's not the standard method. The standard method is to develop solutions until one is accepted. Simply *demanding* to get your way, is not the right way (even if it's popular).

I see you all the time saying this sort of nonsense. It appears that you have nothing better to do with your time than going around badmouthing Bitfinex and margin-trading, which I'm not convinced you fully understand. 


Discrepancies will happen between the exchanges for various reasons. A lower price on Bitfinex, doesn't mean Bitfinex is somehow being malicious.
As for margin trading? It's needed in order to provide *much needed* liquidity. When it's all said and done, the bears will either get caught with their shorts down, or they will take us bulls to the cleaners.

You misunderstood. There is a theoritical 7tps max limit; however, that is only using the smallest transactions possible. In practice, since obviously not all transactions are the smallest possible, there is really only space for 2-4tps.
I'm not opposed to raising the 1MB cap. That said, I'm opposed to BIP101, and I think a more reasonable BIP that expands the blocksize modestly will give us plenty of time to implement other solutions.
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:47:25
We should wait for the right solution. Increasing centralization in any regard is extremely dangerous, as is relying on a single for-profit organization. I think the solution will emerge to be something that incorporates a fee market, "lightning" rails, sidechains, and likely a larger block size.
REGARDLESS, a larger block size will *not* allow for secure zero-conf transactions. No confirms means the transaction isn't in a block, meaning it's not in the blockchain, meaning it's not secured by PoW. A secure payment, on the blockchain, will always require a confirmation.

Consensus among peers.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:10:54
The problem with this is that we'll have to leave it up to miners to agree to the soft-fork to lower the limit. This is problematic since larger miners have an incentive to create the largest blocks possible in order to force out competition. It is likely that extremely large miners would reject a lower limit, consensus would not be achieved, and we'd be stuck with growing centralization of mining and verifying power.

I see what you're saying. I just think that the financial incentive to always make the largest blocks possible, and drive out your competition, will trump this mechanism; and once deployed, we will be unable to take it back.
For the large miner, it is always more profitable in the long-run to force out competition and just take the hit in fees as the trade off.
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:12:16
This is why BIP101 scares me. Already, with 8 MB blocks, my redneck DSL internet would be incapable of running a fully verifying node. If the technology doesn't scale with the blocksize, verifying will become more and more centralized over time. Indeed, even 8 MB (*which is probably reasonable*) leaves me out in the cold, and reduces the network nodes by at least one.
I think a much more reasonable option would be to implement a hard-fork that increases the blocksize, over time, to a cap of ~100 MB blocks. During this block-growth phase, developers will have a chance to work on things like the lightning.network (which really is an amazing idea) and whatever other solutions they can come up with.
This idea that the blocksize needs to be immediately fixed  "once and for all" is short-sighted and dangerous to the decentralized nature of bitcoin. Caution needs to be exercised, and decentralization preserved.

There is a monopoly in my area on Internet connectivity. There is no faster internet. I'm sure that speeds out here will increase over time, but that's beside the point. The point is: there is no reason currently to implement a BIP that increases the blocksize over time to 8 GIGABYTES. A more reasonable BIP that includes modest increases to the blocksize should be agreed upon, while other scalability options are worked on.
I'm not against a jump to 8MB blocks. I do think it's overkill, and would have to shut down my node, but that doesn't mean I think 8MB is entirely unreasonable. My old internet connection in Atlanta would have shrugged off 8MB blocks like it was nothing.

They would never lower the limit, as that would welcome competition back into the mining game.

Whether or not Satoshi still has his private keys doesn't matter. If he does have his keys, he can only sell his coins *once*. It is also likely that he wouldn't do a crazy collapse-the-market sell-off; he would probably trickle his sells as to not damage the project. Even if he did sell all of his coins at the same time, collapsing the price to a penny (he must hate money), the market could recover and probably would fairly quickly; It would be obvious to everyone what just happened and that Satoshi no longer has a million coins, which could even bolster overall confidence in the long run.

I do apologize for being rude. My passion regarding this discussion clouds my ability to communicate calmly. I am sorry.
It is my view that inflating the money base beyond the originally agreed to amount is tantamount to outright theft and deception. It will be impossible to change my mind or meet in the middle on this matter. Any inflation in the money base, adds to market pressure and serves to *devalue* the asset. This has been demonstrated time and time again, and I do not want to see bitcoin go down that road of self-destruction.
I disagree that increased fees makes the network less useful. In my view, the fees are higher in order to secure the blockchain without robbing holders via inflation. This mechanism is what allows bitcoin to resist economic central planning. The higher fees are what is moot here, because we can build decentralized layers on top of the protocol that allow cheap trade, smart contracts, and a ton of other amazing things we've not even begun to discover. All the while the economic incentive to secure the network will be exactly enough, through the naturally-arising fee-market, because of the way difficulty adjustment works. Miners will be competing for fees, the most efficient miners will win, driving other less-efficient miners out of business. What will remain is exactly the right amount of hash-power needed to secure a network with bitcoin's throughput; if the throughput increases: mining will become profitable again and will see expansion as people compete with one another for fees.
Bitcoin, to me, is a beautifully elegant accomplishment of brilliant engineering. It is designed to self-correct and self-govern. It ebbs and flows, naturally. It is still in its infancy, and is being told to change before it's even been given a chance. It gives me a very heavy heart to think that this project could be changed into something else.

You do not understand bitcoin, therefore your opinion is useless. That said, let me explain it to you: Hashing power can vary; It can ebb and flow. As the mining subsidy decreases, some miners will go out of business. This is natural. When we are finally dependent upon transaction fees, they will suffice because the remaining miners will mine higher-fee transactions first. There is no need to keep all of the current hash-power to secure the network.


Again, your ignorance is astounding. Solutions such as payment channels and segwit address the blocksize problem elegantly and without violating the trust people have placed in bitcoin. Payment channels allow bitcoin to be everyday money. Larger blocksizes offload more work onto non-subsidized nodes; this will likely cause a reduction in the already low number of full nodes, as some will not be able to handle the load; this centralizes the network further. With the current state of global bandwidth, we could probably get away with blocksizes up to 8 MB without any huge risks to decentralization. However, classic/xt/unlimited are not the ways to go about changing bitcoin, and are extremely dangerous.


What? My bias is that bitcoin is allowed to grow as it was intended, through consensus, and a fee-market is allowed to emerge. It is an censorship-resistant stateless asset that can be used to transfer value through a communications medium. Because it is a valued asset, it is money. Gold is money. Silver is money. Fiat is currency. I do not want bitcoin to become a currency. I want bitcoin to remain a valuable asset that can be transferred with no permissions. Things such as payment channels will give our valuable asset currency-like properties and allow you to buy your morning coffee with it, without devaluing the underlying asset.
 &gt; For better or worse, protocol decisions are not limited to the technically gifted insiders, it's a brew of users, miners, leading businesses, and coders.
Insiders? Seriously? The miners have a say. The coders have a say. the businesses have a say. USERS do not, nor do they deserve to, have any say whatsoever in what bitcoin becomes. If a user chooses to use bitcoin, it is because they found it and deemed it useful. Users have no business proposing changes. Unless you are running a node out of your house, your opinion is useless. Even if you do run a node, unless you are technically-minded and understand the underlying system and asset your opinion should carry no weight.


It's not moot. Inflation is disgusting sleight-of-hand theft. It should never even be discussed as an option, and only regarded as a vile invention used to rob holders.

What the fuck are you rambling about? I'm not talking about nation states. I'm talking about the blueprint for bitcoin being being trampled on. The whitepaper lays out how bitcoin is supposed to work, we should do our best to stick to it.
@_date: 2016-02-26 06:08:47
The fact that bitcoin is not ready for complete global economic takeover yet should not dissuade people from developing solutions and businesses around bitcoin. If you develop a business or piece of software that is somehow threatened or broken by a debate, or a specific solution, then your endeavor simply didn't pass the survival-of-the-fittest test and it's time to try again. This is not a failure of bitcoin.
As for slowing your own buying, to each their own. I have continued to increase my own holdings without regard to the current debate. I'm not saying either of us is special, just that it likely balances out and had no bearing on actual increased adoption (meaning *more people* using bitcoin).
"Joe public" will use bitcoin when it becomes useful to him; right now he's contented with his government-backed promises. This will not always be the case. From a purely technical perspective, there is nothing stopping Joe from jumping on-board bitcoin *right now*; he's just not-so-interested at the moment.

That day was incredibly stressful for me, and the only thing I have to show for it is less money.

We can just agree to disagree on this point and both hope we are on the right side. We both obviously have very different and passionate views on the matter.


Blockstream is not trying to establish a legal monopoly. They are trying to innovate. The core devs are simply taking Blockstream up on their offer for a paycheck in order to get paid to develop the ideas they have been discussing for years.
I'm honestly not trying to be snarky when I ask you these next few questions, so please try to answer them. I sincerely want to know: 
1. Do you know what Blockstream is funding? 
2. Are you familiar their upcoming products?
3. Are you aware that the products are open source and decentralized?
4. Have you read any of the information on their [website]( or [blog](
5. Do you agree that the developers and maintainers of the world's first digital money deserve to be paid for their work?


And my sixth and final question: Are you aware that Blockstream is open to any blocksize and that they aren't trying to push for small blocks?

NO, IT WASN'T. Now, you're proving that you're completely ignorant, or that you're willing to lie to push your point. 


This statement is ridiculous. Monetary Inflation is inflation; and monetary inflation devalues every other unit in circulation.


No shit. Bitcoin is currently a highly inflationary currency. This is no secret. This is done to subsidize the miners and distribute the coins. After the coins have been disseminated, the mining incentive switches from the mining subsidy to transaction fees. Have you even looked at the [whitepaper](


Fees will "cut it" because miners will mine transactions based on their fee. A fee market will emerge. It may become fairly expensive to write directly to the blockchain, but that is why we have solutions coming down the pipeline to account for this.


Then don't spout your non-technical opinion.


Then go play with altcoins! LEAVE BITCOIN ALONE.


I am worried. I hope bitcoin can grow big enough fast enough so that the protocol is unchangeable by the entitled masses that think they know what bitcoin should be.


Decisions and discussions about things such as blocksize should be left those who understand it and the technical implications it brings. Any responsible change to the protocol will not violate the promise bitcoin made to it's users: decentralized, peer-to-peer, *inflation-proof* (once distribution takes place) money.

Order is important.
1. SegWit
     
    Allows us to get the most out of available block space.
2. Lightning Network
    Allows for microtransactions, and payment channels in a decentralized way.
3. Blocksize Increase
    After we have the performance data of the previously mentioned solutions, we will be better educated on the measures to take with regard to blocksize.
We are not in a technical crisis; nor has adoption stalled.

@_date: 2015-04-09 01:46:18
From my understanding, buying BTC for the sole purpose of spending increases it's velocity, which generally has the effect of a lower price. It is based on this understanding that I try to take as much BTC out of circulation as possible (increasing scarcity, and thus price), and only spend when offered an incentive to do so or it is my only option.
I feel like the future will much bring more certainty in the technology and that will in turn bring more stable prices. More stable prices (support) will allow for a higher velocity.
I do think of my holdings as savings. I will hold to moon or zero. That fiat is spent.

When you initially set up the Trezor it gives you a mnemonic seed. Many wallets (Electrum, Armory) support importing this format. So, in any event that your Trezor is lost or destroyed you (or your surviving family) will be able to use the written seed and recover the funds.

I agree with the sentiment. And I agree 100% that the blocksize needs to be increased (as does literally *every* developer). I just don't care for the way XT pushed code out that was so obviously guesswork at the state of future bandwidth. I absolutely agree we need multiple implementations and that the market gets to ultimately decide; that's bitcoin, and that's fantastic. We need multiple implementations, but we don't need reckless guesswork being pushed out by two of bitcoin's most lauded developers.

You also sound like someone that has been drinking someone's kool-aid.
We should not be planning the blocksize 20 years into the future where we're *guessing* at the state of technology. There is no reason to take such a risk. I just want to see a conservative approach that actually scales without harming decentralization, and we have the time to create one.
I do not believe that the bitcoin codebase will ossify, and I think widespread consensus for hardforks in 5-10 years time will still be quite achievable. In 5 years or so, if the state of bandwidth continues to follow Nielsen's Law, we should all reconsider BIP101 and put it back on the table. Right now, it's just too dangerous in my opinion.


That's pretty irrelevant to this conversation. We're discussing the decentralized bitcoin validating-nodes specifically, not server farms in general.
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:39:51
This is disgusting. Gavin and Mike attempted a hostile takeover of Bitcoin, and implemented code into XT that did *not* pass peer-review. Usually when something doesn't pass peer-review it gets deliberated upon, revised, re-worked, and resubmitted. What did Gavin and Mike do? They tried to throw the weight they carry within the community around and stage a coop. They almost succeeded. Luckily, bitcoin is still young enough that the majority(ish) of users are geeky enough to see through and reject their proposal.
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:37:09

Well, there is math. We do have that. Since we have math, we can know *for fact* that: There is absolutely no way that Bitcoin can scale to handle thousands of transactions per second with blocks gigabytes in size, and still retain any of its interesting properties and freedoms. **This is fact.**
Edit: Even at the end of the BIP101 schedule, with 8 GIGABYTE blocks, the bitcoin network cannot push the amount of transactions per second that the major credit cards do. But that's okay! There are scalability options that not only don't require 8 GB blocks, but also will actually scale the system to visa-level.

I really hope we can scale the network to such capacity levels. It still scares me to rely on guessing at residential bandwidth capabilities 20 years into the future. I advocate a "raise it slower" method, while hoping we're able to scale to BIP101 (8gb) levels and beyond.

@_date: 2015-04-09 22:12:20
I'm going to assume that you're being sincere, and honestly do not understand the statement.
An increasing adoption rate will drive supply down, as more demand comes online. A reduced supply, in an environment of increasing demand, means that people will only sell at higher prices. Therefore the price of bitcoin is directly related to organic adoption. Sure, there will be speculative noise and manipulation in the price, and along with that comes booms and busts, but that noise will become less and less as the market matures (we hope).
So, yes. If bitcoin succeeds in the way that I believe it will, with global adoption increasing steadily, one bitcoin will be worth "tons." :]
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:24:20
I cannot find the blog at the moment, but it was either Mike or Gavin had the tps achievable at 8gb blocks, and it still would have required secondary layers to actually scale to visa's tps. 
Since I can't find it, I may be remembering wrong. I'd love to see the math that proves bitcoin could scale to visa network tps with 8gb blocks.
I'm still concerned that BIP101 goes too far too fast, because I don't like guesswork about the state of technology 20 years from now; Nielsen's Law looks great, but could plateau and we'd be left with growing blocks and the beginning of centralization. 
I am willing to be proven wrong about the feasibility of visa-level tps and 8gig blocks though.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:39:28
**It is a fact** (because math). Even with 8 GIGABYTE blocks, the bitcoin network could *not* achieve visa-level tps; and with such large blocks, mining and verifying nodes will be forced out of certain areas, into server farms, and would do serious damage to bitcoin's primary value-proposition: decentralization.

Can you kill BitTorrent the same way? Decentralized means, you can replace the devs, and the project *will* go on. Open source means that everyone that can read code can audit it. The community means that any attempt to stage a coop will be met with an outcry. Being able to run your own node means that you can reject changes you dislike.
I think if they could stop it, then they would have already. They stopped e-gold. They stopped the liberty dollar. They stopped U.S. Executive order 11110, which would have introduced competition to the central bank. They forced US states to abandon their state-issued money. They have stopped literally every attempt to take back the money system. Except bitcoin. For over seven years, they have not stopped it.

Hate to be the bringer of bad news, but unfortunately, You will have no luck mining with that machine. Mining has become so fiercely competitive that you will need to purchase a specialized piece of equipment called an ASIC in order to run with the big dogs and stay above water. Even if you did purchase an ASIC, it is possible that a network difficulty adjustment could leave you in the dust.
All of that said, if you do actually have free electricity (ie: not screwing over your parents), it may be profitable to sell your new beefy rig, buy the latest and greatest ASIC, and run it; even if the difficulty adjust and you'd be running at a loss, there is no loss because you're not paying the power bill.

sort of negative claim, namely that a thing does not exist. So
it is impossible to prove that Santa Claus, unicorns, the Loch
Ness Monster, God, pink elephants, WMD in Iraq, and Bigfoot
don’t exist. Of course, **this rather depends on what one has in
mind by ‘prove.’** Can you construct a valid deductive argument
with all true premises that yields the conclusion that there
are no unicorns?
What a pedantic stretch of logic. By prove we mean *proof positive of a claim*. Making a list of reasons why CSW is or isn't Satoshi is not proof.
Sure, I can say "There are not any pickles in this jar." Then proceed to prove that fact, but that is not what is meant in the context of proving something for which there is no way to test. You cannot, even if your life depended on it, **prove** beyond all doubt that bigfoot or God are not real, nor could you prove Craig Wright is not Satoshi.

Because it goes outside of the bands? I don't think that means the model is broken. It just doesn't account for the extreme outliers in the price data. Note how it goes way above the red "Sell!" line, and stays there for some months; that doesn't mean it's broken, since at the time, you should have still been selling at those prices. Conversely, being under the blue "Buy!" line doesn't mean it's broken; you should still be buying. :)

Fair enough. Though, I don't think it's wrong to call the bubbles extreme outliers, even if the price did hang out up there for several months. The chart is attempting to guess at the "actual" value of bitcoins, regardless of trader sentiment. Since the number of coins are finite, and it is reasonable to *guess* demand will remain the same or grow, the colors go up; the theory is that while market-sentiment continues to push the price down, the limited number of coins will push the price into it's proper place (signified by the bands). Will it?

Ever how true these statistics are, it's still a fact that there are people who successfully trade for a living. Developing a system with an edge and trading it *consistently* (with appropriate stop-losses [which is near impossible in markets as thin &amp; volatile as bitcoin]), even in the face of majority losses, can be a winning strategy. Basically, if your system has an edge, and you always cut your losers quickly, then your profits will make up for the losses in the long term. Without an edge, and consistency, the house will most definitely win.
If you're into it, I'd recommend reading "The Way Of The Turtle" by Curtis Faith. He likens trading to gambling frequently and discusses the various ways a trader can position themselves to end up with more of an edge. The book also has a lot of computer-simulated data on systematic trading, and will demonstrate that even if the algorithms that are doing the trading lost 70% of all the trades entered, the winners were always big enough to cover the losses and have remaining profit. The key here was mostly sticking to trades that qualified under a certain criteria (to give an "edge"), and entering the trade every single time the opportunity presented itself, and cutting losers quickly. 
    "Do not dwell on the past or try to predict the future.
    The former is counterproductive, and the latter is impossible"

As a full time trader, I can understand where you're coming from in saying this. However, in defense of my profession, I feel like it could use some further expounding upon. 
Yes, trading is similar to gambling. When gambling there is a term called an "edge." When a gambler has an edge, it means he has placed himself in a temporary position where his odds of winning are higher than those of the house. This doesn't work in games of pure random chance (dice, roulette, etc), but it does work quite well in games such as blackjack. For example: Say you're playing blackjack and you've noticed that a lot of low cards have been played, signifying that there are more high cards than low cards; this gives the gambler an edge over the house in that he can stop "hitting" (receiving more cards) at any point, whereas the house has to hit until his hand exceeds the number 16. The gambler knows that the probability of the dealer drawing a high card is temporarily in his favor, because the dealer will have to hit, likely exceed 21 and the house goes bust.
In trading there are similar situations that give you an edge over the other market participants. Most of these edges come from an understanding of the way markets, driven by human psychology, react during certain moments. Traders use a number of tools, indicators, and mathematical formulas, etc to determine which markets are viable for trading, and use that data to try to gain an edge. Without going into too much boring more detail: the edge of a trade is determined by several factors, one of which is the placement of your entry-point. If you are going LONG (betting on higher prices) and the price is 20 dollars away from it's previous (or historic) support (buyer demand zones), and are near historic supply zones (people selling) you have a no edge and a potential downside of 20 dollars + your stop loss percentage. A trade with an edge of -20 is not a particularly smart trade to enter. However, let's say you were going SHORT (betting on lower prices) and in the very same scenario, you would have an edge of +20. 
In trading, much like gambling, everyone uses their own formulas and tactics to find their edge; and like magicians, successful traders tend to keep secrets. Sure, it's all speculation, and no indicator or formula will work all the time; but with enough knowledge, deliberation, and finding a systematic way to trade with an edge, with tight stop-losses, (every trader loses sometimes) will over time grow a portfolio.

I agree with what you're saying here, but I thought I'd point out that it's the market's job to ascertain this perfect information from all of the participants. This is why markets move like they do, with double tops and bottoms and pennant formations; the market is an information-gathering machine. Once enough information is gleaned, a movement happens. The information being gathered is information that was *unknowable* to anyone beforehand. If you can't determine a movement without the unknowable information from all the participants, then you must come up with a means of getting that information. The market is that means. Every single participant is injecting their own personal knowledge and bias into the market through buy and sell orders, and the result is the current price. I personally cannot think of a more efficient method of retrieving the information needed from the participants and using it to determine the value of an asset. 
I tend to think markets are efficient at what they do; however, what they are tasked with is meticulously gathering unknowable perfect information from every single participant, which can take some time, and *appear* to be inefficient and round-about.
