@_date: 2016-04-19 15:59:04
Thanks to all devs!
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:40:32
Yes bro!
Wir kennen uns. ;)
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:03:19
No way!
They may have heard about it, but that's it.
@_date: 2015-07-02 07:48:30
Great article! I agree with every part of what she is saying except the banks.Bitcoin does not need banks!
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:44:32
I agree. The article is really well written of someone who seems to have some cryptocurrency background and is seing it from neutral point of view. No FUD. It shows the actual pros and cons of Bitcoin.Had a great read.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:04:29
You're right. That woman is pure vanom for Bitcoin. I expect a lot of evil from her.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:39:00
HODL HARD!!!!! :D
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:37:57
Forget about the comment section. Very probably some guys of traditional financial sector. 
The article itself is pretty well written.
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:25:52
It's just a highlight video of the conference.But I hope there will come some more specific videos soon.
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:07:26
No man. That investment was done april/may this year!!!3-4 months ago!
Don't exaggerate.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:49:31
This is so great to see. Nikos posted his matter a few hours ago and the whole community seems to care and support.
You gotta love the BTC community.
Awesome guys!
Nikos I wish you and your family all the best in this hard times.May Bitcoin be the way out for you and all the people in Greece who have to suffer right now.

Booaahhh Mike Tyson is doing Bitcoin baby!!!!
Hahahahahahha awesome! :D

Pretty disappointing how things here have developed the last years. Regarding the internet and new technologies, innovations we are so far behind compared to our neighbours. Germany is acting more and more conservative.
@_date: 2016-09-30 08:44:29
Watch the video of Stefan Molyneux regarding that issue.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:09:49
God that woman is so disgusting!
Everytime I hear and see her it shakes me!
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:21:09
That guy is having some followers. Can't be that bad as long as it's not Roger who is this so called "expert". Andreas would be my first choice. But I think it will be finance related. Maybe it's Vinny Lingham. We'll see.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:14:14
Ey Bitcoin Judas has spoken.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:01:32
I like that!
Short and easy to recognize for the dog.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:01:47
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:52:51
Of course you do! :D
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:25:09
Yepp pretty much seems to be the case.
This is getting better and better!LOL
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:56:44
Thank you Andreas for sharing this with us.
Thanks for your honesty, integrity and sticking to your principles!
@_date: 2016-05-14 12:12:12
No that's his younger brother Charlie who created Litecoin!
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:14:31
Yeah this is annoying as f***! Astroturfers everywhere.
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:52:23
God that guy on the right is an asshole!
"If government want Bitcoin out, it's out!"
Good luck trying that! LOL
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:04:49
Bitcoin was around $30 after two years of its existence!!
No premining!No IPO!No marketing campaign and no flooding of email accounts with spam!
Where is Eth now? $12?!
I think that says it all.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:00:55
Hey pal! How you're doing? So sh**coin Jesus kicked you right? Well good to have you back 100%! :)

1000 watching!
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:05:31
Ten years ago really only ~ 4 million people have used Bitcoin??While now it's half of earth's population!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:56:52
Why so complicated?!
Ze germans are having 5,3 trillion in liquid assets.
A billion in german is a trillion in english.Pretty simple.
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:15:54
Doesn't matter. I have a choice now! ;)
And if they try to forbid it I will go where my money is appreciated.And there will be countries!!
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:27:15
Happy halving day buddy!! :D
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:11:31
Coinbase is pure venom for Bitcoin and it's CEO is a big peace of shit!!!Avoid them as much as you can.Time for a boycott!!Who this asshole Brian Armstrong thinks he is??
Sure this place is far from being perfect but all the other Bitcoin related subreddits are at least 10x worse.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:10:13
Man I'm addicted as fuck!
And once you started collecting these cute digital goodies you can't stop it.You always wanna have moaar!!
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:22:55
That is ridiculous!
She is talking pure bullshit!
I'm stunned how dumb all these people must be!
She announces a crazy inflation and the people are chanting!What da fuck?!
@_date: 2016-05-22 14:47:30
If you have ever watched any of Balaji's speeches or interviews you would know that he is a 110% Bitcoin guy!!!!
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:48:40

@_date: 2016-07-16 09:28:23
I don't know why but I have a feeling that Andreas might be going to talk about one of his favoured shitcoins as well!
Please prove me wrong AA!
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:30:42
Doesn't matter!HODL HARD buddy!! ;)
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:04:32
