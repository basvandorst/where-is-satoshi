It’s the biggest order I saw on the order book. Just an observation.

I read that buyers are coming in(whales or institutional $) on coinbase and bidding at around $10,000. Probably s good sign but again, we can’t know for certain if that will hold.
I just bought some more at around $10400. I think there will be another pump at some point and I’ll probably sell some of my stack on the way up.

Technically yes but it’s doubtful your exchange will send a 1099 to the IRS for such a small gain. I wouldn’t worry about it if I were you. But paying it may be smart just be safe.

And I am a CFP. But that has nothing to do with it. I only own 1 BTC, this is more of a fun thing for me, I don’t trade that often and I’m spotty with keeping up on the latest BTC news. There was nothing nefarious about my post, I’m not trying to manipulate anything.

I won’t suffer anything if I hold because btc is headed higher long term

There’s a massive cultural cost. Letting in 3rd worlders that don’t share our language/values/culture and there’s a financial cost. Our welfare state is a magnet to these people who suck us dry. Don’t be naive.

Probably still headed lower. It will probably bottom closer to $9000 before going higher, much higher, again. Buy the dip.

As the son of the Nigerian President, I would be generously happy and honored to be a 6th and 7th party as needed.

You’re investing. An asset with the volatility of bitcoin can’t be considered a savings vehicle.
