Dude.  You posted something that says “friends don’t let friends use Coinbase,” but when someone asks you for a solution you tell them “go do your homework” like a total jerk, not at all like a friend.  If you want people to stop using Coinbase then you should be prepared to provide a viable solution.  
Because of this, I’m gonna keep using Coinbase.

For me, as well as for most people, there's very little downside to using Coinbase so I (along with most people) am not hurt by using it.  You're the one who's trying to convince people NOT to use Coinbase.  I'm just saying that if your post suggests that it's advice from one "friend" to another, you should be much nicer than the approach you're using now, unless that's how you always talk to your friends.

It's not necessarily just Bitcoin Cash.  It's more that there's a question or whether or not Bitcoin will be able to continue to increase in value as it has done in the past.  The arrival of the futures market is certainly putting a cap on how much Bitcoin is going up.  Given that BTC is pretty much the poster child of cryptocurrency in general, its less than rosy outlook will affect the entire cryptocurrency market.  It might not be a crash, but it can be a gradual bleed out.
 
Also, even Charlie Lee sold his entire Litecoin (I don't buy his explanation at all).  Does it look good when the founder of a company sold off his entire holding of the company? Would you be okay if say Steve Jobs sold all of his Apple stock and tell you, "nah man, it's just to avoid conflict of interest brah.  Chill out.  Nothing to see here."  
I don't think anyone can be certain what exactly BTC's future will be, but for now, you can at least expect increase in the number of people who would be on the short side of the trade, which I think is a fair assessment on their part.

As a spectator, I'm enjoying the drama.  I say let it burn baby!

Is this good for bitcoin?

Mind blown!

Bitcoin is also based in trust. The trust that it has value. If people don’t trust that it has value then it doesn’t have value.  The math behind it is completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:48:28
Of course it’s based on trust. Literally most medium of exchange in modern day is based on trust, the trust that someone will honor your medium of exchange (gold, silver, etc) and its agreed upon value.  If people don’t have faith that others will accept this medium of exchange and honor that mutually agreed upon value, then it’s meaningless. You can have crazy complicated math behind it, but if people just look at it and go “Haha, whatever, I accept only gold,” then all that complicated math is useless.
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:54:46
No it’s not.  If the math behind it is the only thing that matters, then we can just duplicate the math and create another coin, and suddenly it’s worth something?  No way.  You can have even more complicated math and that coin can still be shit coin if nobody else “values” it. Gold inherently has no value outside a few industrial uses, but people have used it as a medium of exchange because they know other people have faith in it. There’s no math built into an ounce of gold, but I can buy stuff with it. 
In fact, the value of ANY medium of exchange is based on (1) people’s faith others will accept it as a medium of exchange and (2) accepting it based upon some sort of mutually agreed upon value. The math part is only to ensure that it can be exchanged and provides scarcity, but many other items have scarcity yet are not used.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:25:52
Yeah. At that point it isn’t even about bank run. It’s more that the value of the asset simply tanks. Although hardcore crypto believers will argue that the value of the asset will come back again in the long run, which only time will tell.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:35:10
The same can be said about gold. 
Again. It has nothing to do with the math.  If it’s all about the math then tons of the bitcoin spin offs that based on the same fundamental cryptography should command similar “value” but to clearly doesn’t.  
The TRUST that (1) other people agree to the medium of exchange and (2) agree on the general value do the medium are what allow “money” to have value.
@_date: 2019-04-27 16:11:13
Yeah.  I think people here just don’t want to face the reality that cryptocurrency isn’t immune to scandals / corruptions so they’re redirecting the issue to other seeming related but irrelevant issues.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:18:06
Sweet. Are you saying there’s more room for discount?  Love it. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:28:48
Uhhhhhh are you telling me the price can go lower?!?!
