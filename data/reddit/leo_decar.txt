Binance is fine.  They are operating in Japan.

How is it fake?  Have you looked at the government company search report?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:41:20
Because their platform is not as liquid as you think.
@_date: 2018-09-18 19:07:07
There is.

But nobody voted for them inside China.
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:15:29
Why do they have the rights to block any social media to begin with though?
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:32:15
Except there is no government in China.
@_date: 2018-09-08 13:07:56
"One Party Democracy" is just another Orwellian lie. There is either democracy, or there is no democracy.  And there is no democracy in China. China doesn't want to control Bitcoin. They just want to control their Renminbi, while the Chinese citizens themselves might want Bitcoin, just like they would want to have a free internet.

@_date: 2018-08-10 09:30:37
They are.  Because the bank acts as the agent to purchase Bitcoins for them.  The purchase will be done in the name of the Bank instead of those individuals.

@_date: 2018-08-10 11:57:42
Sighs.  You are actually sort of right re this two-faced observation...  But the only reason why I am slightly excited is because we can finally see some institutional money pouring in to draw up BTC prices to new highs...  In any case, we come in first before em institutions, right? ;-)
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:58:24
Apparently we are all already "poisoned".  Deeply.

At that pub right inside the Citadel. ;-) 
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:59:38
It says don't come in, but it makes you want to go in all that more.  If you know what I am saying...
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:46:38
True.  But the rest of the 29 banks don't do that service though.  Suggests that the institutional money is only starting to flood into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:27:23
Yes, I get this.  That hypocrisy behind BMO.  You know, in no time Citibank will say they will open it up for investment funds into Bitcoins too, after they have suspended all retail accounts from transferring small bits to crypto exchanges for fearing of "money laundering".  Look at all these people.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:45:20
Cheers man. =)  It's definitely a good start!
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:00:42
Nice summary!
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:22:09
Let's not forget what the Time Traveller tells us.  Bitcoin will grow by a factor of ten every 2 years.  In 2017, it would have reached 10,000 USD and in 2019, it would reach 100,000 USD.  And in 2021 beyond, it will reach 1 million USD.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:56:41
Institutional money coming in.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:10:56
Do you know there is like a huge population of Canadians here in Hong Kong?  Chinese money stays in China.  They can't even enter Hong Kong, especially during the current trade war between China and the USA.  And Hong Kong money is like British money cause Hong Kong people still hold British passports.  So I don't think these high net worth individuals at the Bank of Montreal, HK branch are Chinese.  If they were, this branch would have been way bigger.  Try call up this branch.  Maybe you can invest in here too, just because HK is a different jurisdiction.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:14:15
Oh lord, "Chinese investors from HK"?  Since when are HK people Chinese people?
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:45:26
I know man x'D
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:54:21
Indeed.  The halving thing is crucial.  By design, Bitcoin is deflationary.  So it's supposed to increase in value against another inflationary currency, such us the USD.  
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:57:51
No no stop no no stop no no.. ---&gt; We all know where that leads...
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:00:33
Can you sell?
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:24:47
That's an interesting point.  I have never thought of that before to be honest.

The Bank of Montreal branch here in Hong Kong doesn't serve as a retail bank.  It only serves as an investment bank.  Plus the Bank of Montreal, Hong Kong branch and those branches in Canada are considered separate legal entities.  The Bank of Montreal, HK branch is registered on its own at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and governed by the local laws.  Although internal policies might share similarities.  But still, the one here in HK is just an investment bank which only serves those people with at least like couple millions or funds or etc.

Gotta applaud to the Bitcoin designer(s) who calculated halving to come every 4 years over a decade period.  Giving everyone of us sufficient time to hop in while having it sustain in value (Or grow in value if against another inflationary/defunct currency).
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:45:47
Omg x'D
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:52:09
Ah, I am sorry man.  I mis-read it as "as such".  Now I see you said "as **much**".  I feel ya my friend.  Do you think the investment banking sector in their bank allows for investments in Canada though?  Or still no?  Because I often see contradictions in how these big banks deal with retail customers vs corporate customers, who are friends with these bank owners behind the fascade.

Great to hear your story, brother.  Gives us all the more reason to HODL BTC.  If you ever let BCH wins, your hard earned money will become another form of VEF.  BCH is centrally controlled by one communist devil (Jihan Wu) and one ex-criminal (Roger Ver).

Hong Kong does not tax you on capital gains.  If you reside in Hong Kong for 7 years, you earn your citizenship there.  Else you can use a HK company to hold your cryptos, and in that case, your capital gains won't be taxed either under the HK laws.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:43:49
Ya.  A lot of those problems especially as of these two days.

Accountants and lawyers probably don't want to work on your case because you sound like a criminal and they don't want to be associated with you.
