The problem with the people is that they always take a look at the less important things. Clear case.

At least the Openbazaar is getting attention, but i would still prefer to see it on the mainnet instead on the testnet...

Yes the same thing is happening to me. I hope Kraken is not the next cryptsy.

You need to write your posts more clearly.
Question 1: It took 2.17 TB from you? or 2x170GB?
Question 2: It chew 1/80th of your bandwidth or 80% of it?
To protect yourself in future, put a daily upload limit.

Of course it makes sense. Just you cannot do it without patience, same like trading...
However if you want to feel some nice change of value, you will need to buy a bit more than $10 worth of Bitcoin. Try buying at least 1 Bitcoin if you are able to, you will see how it goes then.
Remember, there will be ups and downs and you should not panic in meantime.

I know the title sounds sad, but actually this is one of the best scenarios for Bitcoin to prosper. 
Someone just needs to present Bitcoin to the people of Venezuela and see what happens.

Nicely said. If you cannot buy something with your money, basically those money are not yours.
What you will buy with your money, that is a matter of choice.

Totally true. The US dollar is the first currency used by ISIS, not Bitcoin.

That is why we have the crypto-currencies. Let them try to put a limit on Bitcoin/Dogecoin transactions, that would be fun to watch.

Openbazaar is actually the ebay of bitcoin. Every bitcoiner will get on that train. Also remember the two main things: privacy and low fees (almost no fees).
