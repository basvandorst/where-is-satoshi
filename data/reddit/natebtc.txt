@_date: 2015-06-12 00:42:22

Here the math:  about 4,5% for the transaction + 3% for currency conversion (this is the lower estimate). I'm not sure about withdrawal fees (different in every country), but you end up with an absolut minimum of 7,5%. It seems that paypal charges for that, so we get even closer to the 10% number.
Why so much negativity?!
There was a guy posting here a while ago from the Philippines iirc who showed that as a merchant he had almost 12% fees through paypal (i did not check details tho)
7,9% is probably reasonable. I asked for how much she saved and simply trusted what she ended up telling me. She doesn't give a damn about BTC nor a need to hype it.
"Almost" means almost guys.
Even if it were "only" 7,9% savings, it's pretty significant either way.

Thanks for being there before i even heard about Bitcoin and when nobody else was willing to put their neck out.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:21:12
No need for that buddy.
Of course they ask for a credit card and i'll provide it. Credit cards and Banks are a great product and serve an important function. Their only problem is that BTC is so much better.

haha, same issue here. I'm a big fan of booking.com . Their customer service is top notch.
What happens with hotels is some operators buy them in bulk as you have said. Just like with pricing for flights, factors like "people bought in last x hours" , "search requests last days" etc are part of the dynamic pricing model in the industry.
As such it can be quite random on which site you find the best flight or hotel price. No site is always the cheapest.

Yeah. I think it is great that somebody starts to issue BTC debit cards, but those fees are atrocious.
Competing with banks at their own game is going to be pretty hard

I wish it were true. Bitpay is in Amsterdam where lots of travel sites are located (booking.com for example).
BTC is still not big enough so the pressure will come over time. But unless expedia messes up, i will use them for the rest of my life (assuming equal prices ofc).

Have you ever thought that the person who receives money pays a nice fat fee * ON TOP * of that ?
I hope we get more people on board who actually regularly pay people and know how things work.

OP, it seems that you invested under the wrong premise
**People don't give a damn:**
Yes they don't give a damn and anybody who believes does not know (most) people. Most people are either ignorant or have other priorities in life. And right now for most people the price for not dealing in BTC is not very high. People react to economic incentives rather predictively. You made the right investment under the wrong premise and because of that pulled out for the wrong reasons imo.
**Why Bitcoin (or similar) WILL succeed aka Ignorance has a price:** 
There will be the time however where people have to give a damn. The economic incentives are simply too high. There will be a time where you get punished for not educating yourself on BTC (and for that matter on anything). Every person has a breaking point. The only question is how bad does it have to be...
@_date: 2014-10-13 00:29:02
Good for her, good for BTC, good for us ;)

Opinions about Bitgo guys?

She lives in the Philippines and spends her money there. I live in different places around the year and earn my income in a different currency.
Paypal was still superior over everything else. I'm not a paypal hater. They are still the least complicated way to accept money (pre Bitcoin). Without them i would have to waste my time with WesternUnion and the likes. The guys at rebit.ph make it so easy.
Before them there was no simple way to get this done.

The really sad part is that European debit cards are even cheaper than OP is presenting ;(
You don't need to be rich at all to get a card WITHOUT any fees (no atm withdrawal fees either, internationally). If you complain to the bank, they will even waive the 10 Euro issuing fee.
The only "fee" one would pay is 1,75-2% currency conversion when you're abroad. And even that is super low.
There is a lot of things wrong with banks...but this ain't it
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:55:50
I think OP should edit the title and also post that this company is **INTERNATIONAL** and is available in **quite a lot of countries with many different languages**!
One might get the impression that "only" some airline site in Finland accepts Bitcoin...

Hi, i have around 50k of travel expenses yearly (flights + hotel) and would love to spend more (=all) in BTC.
Here is the problem:
Hotel/aptmt: 
Expedia and 9flats don't always have the best prices or number of available places. I am even willing to pay a small premium for BTC accepting sites (or sites that are honest + good service), but not 50% more (just the last days i tried to use expedia, but that specific hotel was double the price than what i have found through trivago).
Flights: 
I have some business in this sector as well and prices on btctrip are many times 50% higher than on any normal search engine. Try it yourself for international flights, especially in business. Cheapair has some good prices here and there.
Conclusion: 
The most basic incentive to get a more broad adoption is if merchants pass on some savings, even if it is a symbolic amount. I don't understand why the big companies don't do this.
Only strong BTC fans like myself and others would even consider paying a premium (higher price and/or our fees for buying btc).

Here is what you should do:
1) Open a new wallet
2) Send all funds in your current wallet to the new wallet
3) Send BCI the password so they can refund you
There is 0 risk for you. How else would they be able to verify things anyways. I think it is a legit request from their side and if done correctly by you, there is 0 risk.

I hope that you or the other guys in your country will strike a deal with odesk/freelance/elance. This would be a huge win for all parties as payments are one of the biggest obstacles for a global economy

Sorry to hear this OP.
Why is anybody still using Bitstamp these days? They have turned sour already a long time ago.
They have been a great part of Bitcoin and i have no doubt that the original founders never wanted to see something like in this thread happening.
However, their customer support is quite arrogant when they launched their new verification system. This system  is more intrusive than any bank, company registrar or even most governments could ever be.
Wether they "have to" do this or not is irrelevant, because there are lots of superior solutions out there. Don't complain about it, just vote with your money.
I don't know why any European would ever not use Kraken (or similar) and deal with Bitstamp.

Hmmm, i am in the EU currently and had to give a CC 8 out of 8 times... I think it's standard unless you're in a hostel?!

This movie will scare the mainstream if anything.
I think it was very interesting. But to be honest, i would have never paid my donation if it wasn't bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:55:08
Donated $10, still downloading. I'm happy people like you exist. Hopefully you're gonna make (a lot) of money on top of the production costs so we see another episode soon

Anybody paying atm with BTC should not fool themselves into thinking they are directly gaining anything. In most cases we don't. You're missing the point.
I have travelled for 7 years extensively. The only time i got scammed on travel was when booking through a local Brick and mortar travel agency. The agency went broke and my flight and money was gone. Other than that i never had any issue with hotels where a CC would have offered me protection.
Having that said, i will not book a cruise on a privat boat in the caribbean in advance with BTC.
"We" support businesses who help our cause (BTC) and give them our business.
"Selfish charity" would probably phrase best what i am doing.

This pokerstars and even Betfair is misleading. People should know that Neteller supports ** AT LEAST 100 Gambling Sites **
