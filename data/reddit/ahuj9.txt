Right now? The only time that their value was stale was when they where worthless. If you want stability, have a look at index funds.

Will this allow me to transfer from one of my addresses to another, unlike the qt client?

Guys we've invented a new type of currency, it's unregulated!!
Guys stop using it in ways I don't like, regulate yourselves!
Pick one.

There are 2^160 possible addresses - that is 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 written the long way. 
Although it's technically in the realm of "things that could happen", I can safely tell you that it wont. 
As for your second question, the correct answer is "difficult enough". Various mathematical answers I've seen use phrases like "longer than the universe has existed". As long as computers are made of matter ,it won't happen. And when they no longer are, it won't matter.

Hi CharlesDarwinning, absolutely, what you're talking about is called a brain wallet. Instead of memorising the actual keys, the theory involves coming up with a long, unique, and easily remembered passphrase, and running a certain algorithm on that passphrase. The algorithm will give you a new address and private key that you can send your coins to. 
The biggest problem with this idea is that it's easy to brute force common phrases (and variations thereof) and find addresses with coins in them. The solution is to come up with a phrase for your brain wallet that is completely and utterly unique and has never been written down anywhere else in the history of the earth. If you use a song lyric or a phrase from a book or movie, your money is already gone.
Several websites exist that will turn your passphrase into a an address and private key. Make sure you trust the website, as they can, of course, keep a copy of your private key. The following website allows you to copy their code, so you can run it offline if you are that paranoid:
Go to  and click on the Brain Wallet tab.

I always wondered about physical bitcoins like these, how do you know the supplied private key is valid unless you tried to move the BC somewhere else? 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:30:16
Why wouldn't that information be beneficial to anyone?

Cool stuff! One request, can you add campbx.com (in your next update of course ;) )
Oh oh and API that returns a nice JSON object of all the sites and whether they are up or down? 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:31:14
Using a client of your choosing, how can I move coins from one address to another, both of which I have the private key to? 
I know the qt client can't do this in the GUI, but there are a number of cryptic console commands that seem to be able to do this - can someone confirm the correct command? 
To explain further, my problem is that the clients I've seen don't allow you to pick a source address for a transfer (and I understand why). However, I occasionally need to (I mange a few lay person's wallets, and would like to consolidate). 
Edit: I figured it out, sorry - the console has access to the sendfrom command:
    sendfrom sourceaddress destinationaddress amount

A quicker approach would be to use a brain wallet generator like this one:  and entering popular phrases. For example, try entering the ubiquitous "correct horse battery staple". Then enter the resulting address into blockchain.info to check if it contains any bitcoins. My example phrase generates the following address: 
Oh look, 74 transactions. And you know the private key ;)
You may want to download the page at bitaddress.org and change the minimum phrase length to 1 and just enter dictionary words. You could easily automate this. If you did, I bet you would find a bunch of active addresses ;)

Oh absoloutely. I meant, use the site for 10 minutes to realise the futility of mining without a dedicated mining rig. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:27:23
Not sure which part of your post you're referring to when you say "what I say is true though". 
1. Speculators are lame?
2. We should have a trading subreddit for you dopes?
3. You are what is wrong with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:26:58
The QT client wants to download the entire blockchain, that is, a complete history of every single bitcoin transaction that anyone has ever made. How big is the blockchain? Getting close to 7GB, and growing: 
There are other wallets that don't need the whole blockchain to be downloaded, but in this case, I would grin and bear it, and download the whole thing. All other options, like online wallets, give up some amount of control / security. If you're new to bitcoin, use the qt client and download the whole blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:18:04
Yes. In your wallet are your private keys (each bitcoin address has a corresponding private key). 
If I have a copy of your private key, I can not only steal your bitcoins today, I can do it again and again in the future. I essentially own that address as much as you do, and have the same rights to spend the contents as you do.

Try this: 
It's a java based miner. Let it run for a few minutes, and try to figure out how many coins / USD you would make a month. If your answer is above $5, and you're not running a specifically designed mining computer, I'll be amazed.

I can't give you a good reason, but in my heart I know I want the wallet.dat file close and solely under my control. I have a feeling that once I have a closer understanding of the technical aspects of bitcoins, this may change. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:11:35
The same way they solve this problem with cash.

Remember, your wallet doesn't contain any bitcoins. Your wallet contains the private key(s) that allow you to spend your bitcoins. For each address you have, you have a private key. No key, no spend. 
As long as you have some way of getting access to those keys again (which in your example it says that you do), then your private keys are safe. Your coins are actually out in the P2P network, but no one can spend them without access to your keys.

Me too! Congrats on your (and my) first purchase. Hopefully we're onto a winner here.

Once you are sure it's backed up, the wallet is stored in %APPDATA%\Bitcoin - it's the wallet.dat file. 
Once that's gone, search your entire PC for files called wallet.dat and delete those too. 
The answer to your last question is "it depends". What I do, is I have a cold storage wallet generated offline like you said, to which I've transferred mos of my coins. The private key to that address was generated on an OS with no internet access that had no access to any storage like disks etc. Now that most of my coins are safe, I have a few left in my qt client / local wallet.dat. If you transferred all your coins to your cold storage address, then no, you wouldn't need your wallet.dat file anymore. Don't loose that paper wallet though ;)
