Amazon provides way better customer service. I purchased something from Overstock.com, and it came broken. Like, smashed in pieces. It was a vase. What are the return policies? None. I wasted my money with them.
Amazon would NEVER leave me in that situation.

What we need is a cryptobank. An open and verifiable process where you can see your coins on the blockchain. Kudos if you get to keep the private key as well.

If the developer didn't copy state into his own wallet db he wouldn't have this problem.  rule in distributed systems is to always know which system stores authoritative state. In this scenario, it's the blockchain. Allowing withdrawals because of a database value is silly and error prone. Source: I run large distributed systems for transaction processing.

Like the too big to fail banks? Sorry, but as people realize the weaknesses of bitcoin, the solutions makes it look more and more like the old world.
people want to be able to revoke payments. Whether or not this is supported by the blockchain or not is irrelevant when it comes to adoption.

I know what reputable services tell me about how reputable the banks are. Even in the world of bitcoin, you need trust. Trust involves humans... for now.

There could be a market for a reverse-bitpay middle man. Take  credit card, transfers btc to the merchant. Another service could exchange that at market price and wire it to a bank that works with bitcoin.
This would allow customers to use credit and debit cards, and dispensaries to hold cash in a bank.

Might have been the product - but my wife said there was no way to return it and for a CFP,CPA, Wealth Manager I tend to believe her in the ways of money. That said, I could be wrong.
Even THAT said, Amazon hasn't let me down. The two things I bought from overstock were beaten up + missing pieces (a chair was missing a leg and a screw, really? how?), or broken.

I also think that defacing that money is a felony, and you just posted it a picture of you doing it to Reddit, which is pretty much run by the NSA these days. Nice going.

Doubt it. Amazon has enough steady streams of paying and loyal customers they probably see Overstock taking bitcoins for what it is - a PR stunt / promotion to get more revenue from a self-identifying pool of customers willing to spend money.
This is a marketing/advertising play at its core. Say what you want about Overstock.com CEO's libertarian views.
If Bitcoin transactions reach more than 1% of total Overstock orders, I'd be more willing to grok the fact its because of low volume on Overstock.
That said, they correctly identified that customers who want to buy everthing online using bitcoin will put up with their shitty service to be able to spend bitcoins.
So bitcoiners are "free", but then have to completely trust every person they interact with because reversals are not inherently possible, AND they have to put up with the lack of Overstock's customer service. AND they have to buy/mine/earn Bitcoins which is an extra step. Add that to the volatility, and "living a 100% bitcoin life" sound unappealing - and I like bitcoin. I can only imagine what the fleet of single mothers would do.

They will make way more on credit card transactions forever. This is a good way to potentially multiply your projected earning potential early in the game and get some high profile press. Stripe is awesome, but I'm not convinced this is a big deal... yet.

Call it BitOrder. Print and send the QR banner with brand logo to truck operator. They can run it from a phone, and you charge a freemium model on the number of orders. Done. Who wants to give me a million in funding?

What is wrong? That you only stand to win a satoshi if you can double on 35 consecutive bets on just-dice? Or that doing it a satoshi at a time isn't worth it?

Oh  how the important details are lost in nuance. Question for Apple lovers - what makes you think a local wallet.dat file is safe on an iPhone? Maybe Apple knows it's not, and they are protecting their dumb user base from complaining how their iPhone  was hacked and their BTC stolen? If you think this r/bitcoin drama is bad, try cleaning that PR mess up.

The name's coin. Bitcoin. The money of mystery. I do not need a license to bill.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:51:12
And now let's count active projects, projects with actual commit histories and line  of functioning worthwhile code. How many of these projects at  forking a wallet implementation to play around?
Sure, that means something, but it's no measure that bitcoin is smoking PayPal and square. What if square "just fuggin works" so indie dev isn't needed?
Taking scepticism further, one could reasonably argue it  a measure of how far bitcoin needs to go, and how long it will take the open source community to get it there. I mean, look at Linux. It's mainstream cred hasn't been around forever.

This is OTC exchange, not a valid exchange of goods and services rendered and taxed. Wire transfers or credit transfers are not the same thing, I think.

The takeaway was the US will kill it, and it will luve outside the US. And as prisoners we sit here and watch football instead of soccer and use dollars instead of bitcoins.
The last part is my hyperbole.

I think it's safe to say the free an  open argument is just that, an argument. IPhone won the phone market. Done. IPad will probably keep the tablet market as well, for now. Done. Android will win the mobile and device market. Just wait and see what products will be running android. In some cases, you won't even know. Have  you checked the bios of your DVD player recently?

Absolutely. My point is if there really was an edge that was worth the time, casino's would go out of business.

If you dont consider bitcoin as gambling I worry for anyone that relies on you financially.

Because the money he recieved didnt belong to the person that gave it to him? Same reason you can get into hot water by having possession of stolen items even if you didnt know it was stolen when you bought it.
You have to truat the other party. Which is hilarious from a bitcoin perspective.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:00:41
Continuing the math, that means each win gets you a satoshi. Not even worth it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:57:33
Yes. But think about how many rolls it would take. Even if you are betting 5btc on your 20th loss, you only stand to regain your loss and win a satoshi. With 1 win per satoshi, you could make money faster working at Wal-Mart.
