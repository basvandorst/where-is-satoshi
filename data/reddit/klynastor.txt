The Trezor uses either a 12, 18, or 24-word string that is supplied as the seed, as specified in BIP39 (mnemonic seeds). This gives you a BIP32 hierarchial deterministic wallet (lots of addresses from one seed).
But the cool thing is you have the option of supplying a password to the Trezor. This changes the seed in some manner (outside of the normal list of choosable words) and gives you an entirely different hierarchial wallet. In other words, it appears as a completely different wallet with a whole new set of addresses. So if somebody found your word list and entered it into a Trezor, they're not going to see the same list of addresses you have unless they put in your exact password.
The Trezor people also billed this as a feature: you can load a small amount of coins onto the Trezor using one password, and a large amount onto the same Trezor using a different password (but same seed). Then if someone was forcing you to reveal all of the coins you have on your Trezor, you can just type in the password for the wallet with the small amount of coins and show them your balance.
See the Trezor FAQ [here] (
I guess I should also mention I've got a Trezor, but I've never used the Trezor website or put in my password over the web. I use electrum and do everything locally on my computer.

Don't use the usb cable that came with the Trezor. It sucks. Buy a good quality cable and it'll work for you all the time.

Not unless you use a password with it. An attacker would need both your word string and memorized password to get your funds.

The Trezor signs your transactions for you and lets you verify it on the Trezor's screen before you press the Confirm button (on the Trezor). Since it's a hardware wallet, it is basically impossible to be hacked by malware on your computer. 
Otherwise, with a paper wallet, you're trusting your computer to sign the transaction correctly once you type in the private key. That may not work so well if your wallet program was compromised by an attacker.
Sure, for the few minutes you're at risk between typing in your private key and actually signing/broadcasting the transaction, chances are nobody's going to steal your funds. But the more BTC you have, the more a Trezor sounds better than taking any such risk.

I first researched Bitcoin back in Dec 2012, when the price was hovering around $12. I was going to buy 4 of them as Christmas presents for my family.
But, I didn't like the idea that using Bitcoin effectively meant you had to store every blockchain transaction on your hard drive. This was back in a time before most people knew about Electrum, and in a time when *everyone* was sending money to SatoshiDice. So I scoffed at the whole thing, thinking "Nobody's going to want this on their computer...this is never going to fly mainstream".
I also heard that new and improved miners (I forget who.. BFL?) were about to be released, and I thought that would flood the market with BTC in a couple of months and therefore decrease each coin's value. So, I ended up not buying any, and I figured I'd wait and see what happens. 
I didn't think to check the market again until Feb 2014. This time, I actually read the whitepaper. Then I discovered Electrum, and I bought in instantly...even though the price was 50x higher.
"If only..."

Yes. Before you begin, the Trezor's screen walks you through the setup process, which involves writing down 12, 18, or 24 words onto a piece of paper (not stored on the computer, so nobody online can hack you). This is like a key; these words will allow you to regenerate your entire list of addresses onto a new Trezor--or even a software wallet if you do not have a Trezor available later in the future. And you can set a pin and/or a password on it, so it's worthless if it gets stolen.
I have one, and I feel my coins are very safe with it. I use my Trezor with the Electrum software wallet on my PC. I think the latest version of Electrum is able to initialize the Trezor by itself now. Otherwise you can initialize it using the Chrome browser online at [mytrezor.com](

Check out [Open Alias]( This has been around for at least a year now.
It's built into the DNS lookup system, so in order to publicly advertise a bitcoin address you would need control over the domain name to add a TXT record for your specific email address. So, in other words you couldn't set it up yourself for emails like mikesmith you would need to have an email address on a domain you own, like mike The process is similar to adding a IP Address for yourhostname.domain.com. But, it's possible if one large email service adds support for this and Bitcoin really goes mainstream, then other email providers will likely follow suit.
If you have a wallet that supports OpenAlias (such as the OpenAlias plugin for Electrum), then you just type in someone's email address into the Pay To text box and it will automatically convert to their bitcoin address.
The only issue here is the security implications of a man-in-the-middle attack, who changes the bitcoin address en-route between the DNS server and your computer doing the lookup. So this probably won't go mainstream until the whole internet is convinced of the benefits of solely switching to a secure DNS implementation (just like how all websites are migrating to https-only nowadays).
But the whole thing is as easy as adding this one line to your domain name DNS file. Here would be user mike for instance:
    mike        IN       TXT       "oa1:btc recipient_address=1JhruTmc2BhnbsRkzRXCM2utJBPTS4NtQU;"

I visited...and somehow from your post I got the expectation that all the prices would show in BTC instead of USD. Wouldn't this make more sense for a bitcoin-only store?
Maybe do what buytrezor.com does, and take a snapshot of the average BTC price on the exchanges once per hour and round to the 3rd or 4th decimal place and post those prices. And you can always show the USD price alongside BTC, or show USD with a mouse-over. Or, maybe if you click the price it changes back and forth between BTC and the currency of your choice, like on blockchain.info.
Just a thought!

Have a look [here](
For every 0.0001 BTC tipped out, there's a 0.0001 BTC fee being paid. So exactly **half** of the bitcoin donations given to the pot aren't even being collected by the players.
The minimum transaction fee for relaying on the network is 0.00001 BTC right now, not 0.0001. I don't know if using 0.0001 is intentional (giving back to the miners?), but it looks like that pot could stay higher a lot longer if the lower fee is chosen instead.

I bought from grasshillalpacas.com once. The socks are untouched--been waiting for the right moment to try them on.
I went to an alpaca show out in the midwest last spring. Could've sworn I saw the exact same brand of socks on sale there as the ones I received from grass hill. I don't have the tag on em anymore, or I'd take a picture and ask if they look familiar to you. Maybe I can pick up another pair...

Minimum fee for network propagation is 0.00005 BTC/kB. *Right now* there is no backlog of transactions, so this fee will go through just fine. For a typical transaction, that's about 1 cent.
Setting a fee of 0 is like winning the lottery to get your transaction in. It's hoping the random miner who's still using an older version of Bitcoin Core never set their MinTxRelayFee parameter.

Just a few cents. Estimate your fees here: [bitcoinfees.github.io] (

It means you can write yourself a check, then using the banking app on your mobile phone, you can take a photo of the check written in your name, and the banking app will send the picture to the server and credit your account (usually the following morning). But that only works up to a certain amount ($1000 or so) due to fraud.

This is my first GitHub project, so I'm a little green with Git. I wasn't sure if a submodule would automatically pull in the latest version of secp256k1 whenever you cloned the parent project. I know the copy of secp256k1 I've got in there now works with the code I've written.

The original vanitygen seems to have a problem parallelizing its work among many threads, at least for me. I used vanitygen for a long time just as a benchmarking tool to test speeds of PC's and servers bought at my company. It seemed to max out at 850K keys per second regardless of the CPU speed or number of cores in the CPU. I would have expected 2x12-core servers to come in higher than 800K, considering my 4-core laptop reported around 900K. But that was never the case.
With this new program, the reported speed definitely scales as you add more threads or run on faster cores. My laptop now averages 1900K/s, and running on an 8-core server achieved about 5100K/s.
This new program is very stripped down and doesn't support any GPU devices. It's CPU-only, but it contains extra assembly functions to do fast SHA-256 hashes on amd64 CPU's.

The address generation uses /dev/urandom to generate a random 256-bit private key. Why did I choose /dev/urandom? You can read some literature about it [here]( [here]( and some defense [here]( It's not a perfect solution in all aspects, but it is simple enough to verify there's nothing weird going on behind the scenes in the code.
There is a new system call in recent kernels called getrandom() that can be used to query the kernel for random data (same as /dev/urandom), except without opening a device called "/dev/urandom" in filesystem space. This protects against hackers who have converted /dev/urandom to a symlink pointing to a file prepopulated with random numbers. I didn't use this because it's a relatively new system call and not everybody has a C library with support for this yet.
In any event, I would welcome any security reviews of the code.

You can send Bitcoins to an email address using OpenAlias. It piggybacks off of the current DNS system and requires DNSSEC to be set up properly at the domain registrar level. Frankly I'm surprised we haven't seen more pay services out there that sell you a secure email address that can receive bitcoins at whatever public key you give them. But I guess it's hard for a single user to verify that their email address correctly points to their public key 24 hours a day. It makes more sense only if you own your own domain and have control over your own registrar settings (and even then, you need to be extra careful someone doesn't hack your DNS settings and change the public key when you're not around).
