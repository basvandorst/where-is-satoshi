If anyone is looking to sign up with robinhood, dm me for a referral link. If you sign up you get 1 free stock, with it being a 1 in 150 chance of it being Apple or Microsoft.

Is it old? I never saw it on the sub anywhere, and I never saw it on the app until today.

Robinhood really is free. I've been using it for a couple months now for stocks and every trade you make is completely free. They make money on interest from the money you're not using on the platform.

Yeah that's what I was doing. I ended up giving up on it and just taking the hit from the fees on coinbase. I lost $7 because of that but oh well. I'm pretty pissed none of their stuff works correctly. If you see my comment below, the transferring threw Error 400 codes in the console, which means their site was down for that part. I waited like 30 minutes but there's nothing I can do when the website is broken.

You can get a wallet for free and transfer it there for free, so it doesn't hurt to move it really. Better safe than sorry. If you're not planning on selling anytime soon there's no reason to keep your crypto on an exchange anyways.

Any recommendations on free wallets? I'm not looking to spend money on a hardware wallet, I don't have enough invested in that. Just looking for options outside of leaving it on coinbase. Thanks in advance.

The price that I bought it at. It just takes that long for it complete.

As the other guy said, use GDAX. It's free to transfer and it took five seconds to show up in my wallet.

It took 9 days for me to get the coins after my first purchase.

Exactly. That's why I went ahead and bought it on Coinbase. I mean, I could have very well lost more than $7 while waiting on them to get back to me.

So after waiting for 5 days for my money to transfer into my wallet on coinbase, today I tried to load the money onto GDAX and purchase some crypto. However, I get the error message insufficient funds with every single amount I try when transferring to GDAX, despite the money clearly being in my Coinbase account. Has anyone else had this problem or know what to do to fix this? I've tried on multiple browsers as well so I know it's not a browser issue.
Edit: I can't transfer anything from Coinbase to GDAX. Dollars, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin all say insufficient funds for any number.

The problem with that is it is a $2.99 transaction fee for each purchase to buy on Coinbase as opposed to GDAX. That's $9 that I essentially lose because their site isn't working. I checked into the console and it's throwing 400 errors on account transfers right now. I emailed support but I don't know how long it'll be before anything gets fixed.
