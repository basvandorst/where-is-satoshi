Let me add that many people (ordinary people) are paranoid about leaving their money to banks.

Even those who claim (very very few ideological-biased non-productive people) is a shame to hold USD do it. It is the safe thing to do here for common people.

I agree (and I am also in Argentina), nobody talks about bitcoin seriously. We will adopt it after the world has adopt it. If this economical breakdown continues dollar would still be main choice for 100% of people to save value.
I own bitcoins since 2013 and been hearing this story once a week. All the momentum Argentina is gaining in bitcoin community is misunderstood.

Do you think there is an opportunity for ASIC developers to transfer some of the bitcoin algorithms from software to hardware in order to increase throughput?

dude, relax. I get how unjust it was and how potentially possible it is every morning to have that headline again. Perhaps paranoia should be changed for suspicious. what do you say?
No way, I am leaving my money in the bank. Moreover, high rates only increases fear of having another "corralito".

It is really hard to say.
Let me put it this way: Of all the people I know who is acquainted with bitcoin, only 5% really cares (and I am being really optimistic here and I usually hang out with techy people).

This is an accurate suggestion. I agree with everything on that episode.

I found commissions of 4.5% to 6% too expensive (due to costs associated with cash funding your account with payment processors). It is better than MercadoLibre though.
