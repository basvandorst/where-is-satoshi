This is concerning. Have we reached peak bubble? Is the price resting on top of the hopes and dreams of newbie investors (grandmas, soccer moms, 15 year old keedz, etc) ready to panic sell and send the price collapsing faster than Roger Vers ego anytime someone mentions "Bcash"?

You should transfer your coins to a hardware wallet for the most security. The two best ones at the moment are Trezor and Ledger Nano. With each of these the process is pretty straight forward. They even come with instructions! :)

All these arguments are easily refuted. If we are to make progress, we have to be realistic of what BTC is good for and what it is not. The above points are not true. 
1. Risk of stolen credit cards is not a risk to avg Joe. They get refunded any stolen money. The risk here is on the part of CC companies. 
2. Bitcoin doesn't address these problems. Be your bank is the worst slogan. Nobody want's to be their own bank, that's why they exist in the first place. People are terrible at security and want to offload that burden onto someone else, no matter how shitty they are. + Avg Joe's aren't going to be using bitcoin wallets. They're going to be using Coinbase / Circle, which is back to using a bank again with all the same problems you mentioned + bitcoin volatility. 
3. Paypal - use the pay as friend / family option to bypass fee's

Bitcoin reverses the fee. Instead of the merchant paying a fee that would be much more than 7 cents. the buyer is the one that pays the fee. And honestly it makes more sense this way. Why should the merchant be burdened with this fee? The buyer is gaining the biggest convinience by using a frictionless payment system. No need to cary around wallet stuffed with bills and coins. 7 cents seems perfectly reasonable to me. Put it this way. Working a minimum wage job of say $7 an hour.. someone can perform 100 transactions for 1 hr of their minimum wage work. What is the problem here?

They claim to bring many things to the table.. and if they suceed they will be by far the best option to buy / store crypto.
1. Free purchase of bitcoin. No trade fee. No 1% purchase fee (coinbase). No 10% purchase fee (localbitcoin, mycelium, etc)
2. After purchase you get Instant bitcoins into your account, no waiting (wait for 5 days with coinbase)
3. Your bitcoins are insured. (put the Goxed ones at ease, and puts your mom at ease)
4. Good customer support (anyone who delt with coinbase a year ago knows about the 1 week lag time on getting support.. not sure how they are doing now.. hopefully better).
5. Easy to use interface, all denominated in your local currency. (when at coinbase why do i have to enter the bitcoin amount i want to buy, wtf can't i enter a dollar amount)
If they deliver on all these points.. nothing will be able to touch them. 
That being said. This whole invite debacle is a disaster.... They keep on claiming that they are sending invites out to the bitcoin newbies... How do they know your bitcoin knowledge level based on your email? This is complete hogwash. Hopefully it isnt a sign of things to come.

But how much efficiency is good enough? I think for the majority US Americans there is not tangible benefit to using bitcoin. 
1. Shopping online and paying with credit card vs. shopping at brick and mortar (getting dressed, get in your car, drive, walkinto a store, search around, pick up product, cashout, go back to your house. etc.) Shopping online with credit card is vastly more efficient than going to brick and mortar. 
2. Shopping online with credit card vs shopping online with bitcon. Hmm.. shopping online with bitcoin is actually more trouble than its worth for most people. (Questions they have to figure out: what is bitcoin?, how do i purchase bitcoin?, ok now i have to wait 1 week to get bitcoin into my account?, hopefully it doesn't drop in value by the time it gets into my account.., how do I pay for something in bitcoin?) In the case of a new user that is not familiar with bitcoin, they would have to spend a couple hours researching bitcoin, then wait a couple days to get bitcoin, etc.. vs spending a few extra seconds typing in their credit card number.. Which one are they going to pick?
I'm not a bitcon hater i'm just trying to move this discussion forward. Shopping online with bitcoin is not a killer app in my book. Only drastic savings/discount offered by a merchant might prompt a few people to investigate bitcoin enough to get into the economy, but even then it's a huge hurdle.

Dwolla transaction fee is .25 usd. Bitcoin is practically free. Dwolla personal accounts there is a $5,000 per-transaction limit. Business accounts have a $10,000 per-transaction limit. Bitcoin. No limits. Also, you can transfer fractions of a penny for mass micropayment paywalls, + other stuff people havent even thought of. That is what i figured out from 2 seconds of research.

One problem.. there is no real need for bitcoin in the US. They already have a system that works better than bitcoin for all intents and purposes. Not volatile. Not complicated. Banks are good at securing your funds. Credit cards, debt cards, and tap to pay have made paying extremely easy. USD is accepted EVERYWHERE. Everyone already understands it. It has a high level of trust. Good credit cards provide you with 1-2% points on everything you buy providing an incentive to stick with the system. 
There is no killer sales pitch for bitcoin in the USA. The truth is the vast majority of people don't care about the financial system, and they don't want to understand it. They are happy living their distracted lives and money is the last thing they want to think about. Learning about and adopting bitcoin will in no way, shape or form improve their lives. 
Please tell me, what incentives does bitcoin provide the general public?

@_date: 2014-03-03 20:13:32
You don't have to accept bitcoin directly. You can use coinbase or bitpay to accept bitcoin and then it is immediately converted to USD. Right now, bitcoin is in a state of price discovery and will be for a couple more years, but eventually it will get to its market equilibrium and have a more stable price. At that point it will be used more like traditional currencies and won't have to be immediately converted to lock in its value.

I see this argument all the time from people trying to defend the current volatility of bitcoin, but how many years / decades down do you see this stabality actually materializing in bitcoin to the point where it will be a stable store of value (USD level stability). 
Bitcoin currently behaves like a penny stock. All the big voices in bitcoin (Andreas, Marc Andreeson, et al)  always say more liquidity will bring stability to bitcoin, but if you look at other commodities that is absolutely not the case, Gold, Oil? Those have tons of liquidity relative to bitcoin and they are still all over the map. 
My fear is that bitcoin will be relegated to backend systems of exchange for b2b / bank 2 b / bank to bank exchange of value and will never catch on as a consumer currency or a currency for the other 6 billion underbanked, or whatever you want to call it..

Let's get realistic. Humans understand value very well. The problem is that bitcoin doesn't offer value that is 10 - 100x better than the system currently in place. The **general public** (aka Avg Joe, NON-NERDS, senior citizens, house wives, etc) are fine with a USD, credit card, cash, inflation based system.  It's good enough. Even if bitcoin was 10 - 100x better, people hate change and will probably stick with the crappier solution that's been around for hundreds of years.

Are we still blowing sunshine up everyones arse around here? Let's zoom into New York. NYC has estimated more than 190,000 small businesses ( How many places accept bitcoin in NYC do you ask? Let's look at a picture taken today from bitcoinmaps.info - 
Let's just be nice and say there are 100 places that accept bitcoin in that image of NYC. I'll be super generous and add 500 to to that image, because it probably isn't the most accurate. So, let's just say there are 600 places that accept bitcoin in NYC out of a possible 190,000 small businesses. Let's do a little math, and viola, we have .3% adoption. This is the adoption in one of the countries most progressive cities. Imagine what it is in others.. We have a long road ahead of us.

You know Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places..  you don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin.. you can buy $1 of it if you want. Is that approaching your maximum exchange value? Pretty sure most people can afford $1. 
Ultimate valuation? It is already the 30th most valuable currency in the world. What is to stop it from going further? It is a better form of money the world has ever seen so yes it will keep on going up. Once it gets to the top 5 currencies in the world it will be worth about 5.8 million per bitcoin.

I'm not sure how.. but I've gotten three people on my current work project to buy into bitcoin, and they've each actually purchased 1 bitcoin.  I just kept on casually mentioning it every once or twice a week. Interestingly enough, all three of them were women, but still in the tech field. 
The key thing i said, and everyone just lost their minds is when I mentioned that i make 15k a year selling on localbtc. When i said that everyone started tripping over themselves to learn more about it. WHERE DO I BUY BITCOIN&lt; HOW DO I SELL IT OMG TELL ME.
Protip.. don't start with brain wallets..oh, the blank stares I got when i mentioned that. Here i was thinking backto when i first read about it and how cool it sounded. NOPE. Just blank stares. 
You have to give it credability.. and the main way to do that is to mention how Big banks are starting to research it, how NASDAQ and the NYSE are working on integrating it into their backend systems. How Microsoft &amp; MIT are heavily researching it, and point them to their talks about it.. It's all about credibility. There has been so much massive negative PR with its association with the Darknet / Dark Markets, that you have to slowly erase that with positive associations. It's a hard battle, but after 4 months of just talking about it every now and again. I have my first converts. Feels good man. Just be a normal person about it, and be accepting if they don't understand its massive implications right away.

Ah yes, .3%. Let's not forget that i'm being extra generous by about 500 locations (that probably don't actually exist).

They get hyped on worthless ICO's, and buy a ton of alts instead of bitcoin. New people coming into this space are completely lost. 
Many of them are not experience investors and don't understand that HODLING is paramount. 
I got my cousin into it when it was $600 and he sold at $950. I told him he made a huge mistake, and he's just like.. i'll buy it when it dips below again. &gt;_&lt;. 
I have a co-worker friend that bought good chunk and sold off when Jamie Diamon started up up with his smear campaign. He never bought back in and missed this huge run-up. He ended up losing 33% of his investment.

BTC is a long term Store of Value.
1. Who pays for something with a highly volatile asset that can go up / down 20% on any given day?
2. Who pays for something that long term will have much greater value?
3. Who pays with something that is accepted at less than .01% of retail stores?
4. Who pays for something with BTC when they could use a credit card that pays them 2% back on every purchase?
5. Who pays for something with BTC when credit cards are accepted at 99% of retail locations.
6. Who pays for something with BTC when credit cards have strong consumer protection?
7. the list goes on and on.. BTC, and every other crypto (sans stable coins) are terrible forms of money.
8. BTC is not for your Starbucks coffee.
9. BTC is for saving and earning wealth in the future.
10. What bitcoin will be is a reserve asset. Maybe layer 3 solutions will enable a stable coin that runs on top of the lightning network.. Then and only then can we start talking about using it to replace credit cards and traditional forms of money.

BTC as a protocol means .00000001 btc being used as a token that represents something. A 'smart contract'. A 'colored coin'. Whatever you want to call it. Currently, a satoshi is worth a tiny fraction of a penny. For a satoshi to be worth one penny, 1 btc would have to be worth 1 million USD. I'm not convinced btc as a protocol will help at all with its value. It is not scarce at all when you consider it as a protocol.

There isn't a big enough incentive for anyone to use bitcoin over USD. You can throw all the community at it you want.. Doesn't change the fundamentals. Major detractors include high volatility, unfamiliarity, negative perception, storage and security complexity and a current system that works good enough. 
Yes, bitcoin has a lot of positives, but unfortunately they do not come close to outweighing the negatives in the public eye. Not yet, at least.

According to Circle.com, from their front page: "You shouldn't have to pay fees to use your own money. We don't charge fees when you convert funds to or from bitcoin with a linked bank account, when you store your bitcoin, or for bitcoin transactions."
This is a false statement. 
Example. 1. I buy 10 dollars worth of bitcoin on circle.com. I go to buy a $10 pillow from overstock.com with bitcoin. I can't, I don't have enough money in my circle account.

* what is cold storage - Storing your bitcoin on a something that has never touched the internet. Be it a hardware device like the TREZOR, or just a paper wallet. The whole purpose for this is to maximize your security and reduce the potential for someone to hack your computer and steal your bitcoin. 
* what does a hardware wallet do and what are the benefits of using one - see above.
* what is paper storage? Writing down your 12 words on paper as opposed to storing them in a computer file? Pretty much. It is also more convinient because with most paper wallets it prints out with a QR code. When you're ready to transfer from cold storage back to MyCelium you simply scan the barcode with the app and you have access to those bitcoins. 
* Why multiple wallets? To not put all your eggs in one basket? - I think what you mean is why multiple addresses. Good wallets automatically generate a new bitcoin address for every send and receive of btc in order to increase your anonymity and hide how much bitcoin you own. Since all transactions are stored in the open, if you only used one address, someone that has only done one transaction with you would be able to see pretty  much everything about all your transactions including how much btc you have, where your btc is coming from, who else you are sending to, etc. Using multiple addresses makes this a bit harder to perform this sort of btc forensics analysis.

@_date: 2015-02-19 01:35:31
if you are in the USA you want to buy bitcoin with USD go with either Coinbase or Circle. Keep in mind that these sites track your activity. If you wish to remain more anonymous I would transact from a wallet like MyCelium (on mobile). 
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:11:32
I've used pretty much all wallets out there and these would be my top pics for each platform.
Electrum for Mac &amp; Windows.
Breadwallet for iOS.
MyCelium for Android. 
If you don't want to think about storage you can always go with a web service like Circle.com. This is probably the best option if you're a newbie. You can buy a little on there and then transfer it to one of the wallets I mentioned above as a test. Just play around with small amounts. 
The best hardware wallet is TREZOR.

From a recent ama on here of someone who's been living on btc for the past two years.. Step to buy gas. 1. Converto USD to BTC (incurring anywhere from a 1% to 15% loss depending on how you buy btc). 2. Buy Gyft Sears Gift Card. (waste of time) 3. Drive to Sears and buy a gas station gift card with sears gift card. 4. (waste of time and gas). Drive to Gas station and pay with Gas gift card.

These tiers of people you describe that have slightly lower and lower levels of currency volatility risk acceptance do not exist.. Why even bother getting into bitcoin when you already have a currency that does everything you need it to do and is also stable. People don't care that a merchant is saving 1-2%. They do care that they are getting 2% back using credit cards though. There is just no incentive for mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:53:55

There is no difference between private block chain and database synchronization. That's the whole point. The power of the bitcoin blockchain comes from it's massively distributed structure and open nature. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:28:28
The volatility in bitcoin negates any small savings a merchant could pass on to the consumer. And people already routinely get 2% back from rewards credit cards on every purchase they make.

The network effect for money has already happened. In the US its called the United States Dollar, and its penetration rate is something Facebook would be jealous of. 99.999% user adoption. Being that there is no consumer side incentive to use bitcoin (outside of dark markets) I would say we have a steep uphill battle.

that's what I'm scared off. I would guess that 99% of all volume movement right now in bitcoin is because of fiat exchanges.  There is such a limited supply of good places to spend the bitcoin, combined with the fact that WHY spend it if you think it will be much more in the future.. 
For example.. All those people in this subreddit giving $.25 tips to comments in here.. If 1 bitcoin ever hits $100,000 per bitcoin.. That tip is now a $100+ loss. 
There isn't really any incentive to spend bitcoins..

its just supply and demand, based on tons of different factors, social, technical, economic, awareness, political, imagination, tradition, adoption rate, etc. Nobody can predict the future. Most who try to day trade, no matter how 'experienced' will lose money. The best strategy is to buy... and hold. Forget about the charts.. they will drive too many emotions inside of you and you might get inclined to sell off prematurely. 
TLDR: Buy and Hold.

1. A bitcoin transaction is posted almost instantly on the network. you can see that the transaction has been initiated in less than 2 seconds.. What takes longer is the multiple confirmations of that transaction. The confirmations are there to ensure that no one is double spending bitcoin. Double spending bitcoin is extremely difficult and not worth the effort for small dollar purchases so you can trust that once you see the transaction on the network, you are guaranteed to recieve that money. Simply test this out for yourself using electrum. Send a small amount of bitcoin (.00001) between two of the address' in your electrum wallet. You can see how it works in real time. 
2. I'm not sure what you are using for invoicing but there are excel / google spreadsheet macros that automatically grab the latest bitcoin price and put it into your spreadsheet. 
The main perks for merchants are..
1. No 3rd party payment processor fee's. (you could pass the savings onto your customers or keep it)
2. no reversed payments.
3.  no need to deal with banks. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:02:10
Bitcoin is the future of money, just like mp3/digital distribution was the future of music, and it took people 15 years to realize. If they accept payments in bitcoin and hold on to them, they could see their money multiply by 10x - 100x.

This is the key. Offer deep discounts to people who pay in bitcoin, to get them into the market! Bitcoin population increases, usage increases, bitcoin price goes up and closer to market equilibrium, and owners get to profit on the increasing value of their bitcoins! win win win win win.

How long will it take for bitcoin price to stabalize? At this point it's behaving like a penny stock. To be seriously considered as a currency you would think that it can't be fluctuating up and down by 70% on a weekly basis.

the current iteration of bitcoin is not what it is going to be in the long run. You can build credit card services, on top of bitcoin that will make it "instant".
This is a protocol. Just like HTTP was back in the 90's .. nobody imagined the internet would be the way it is now.

The analogy is that even though the Chinese will do everything in their power to slow and stop bitcoin, it will not stop people from using it. It cannot be stopped unless you bring the entire internet down. China even has their great firewall that is supposed to block sites, but everyone who lives there knows how to get around it. I'm just saying that they are powerless to stop it.

I had the same question a couple weeks ago, then I stumbled on this gem:
I've seen an increasing amount of people who think that saving (or "hoarding") is somehow bad for bitcoin. I'd like to take a moment to dispel this myth.
It's important to remember that saving is spending. This may sound paradoxical, but it's important to keep an open mind. If you're in r/bitcoin, chances are good that you've already realized that most of what you've been told about economics was a lie. My advice to you is to keep going down that rabbit hole.
Saving is deferred spending. Nobody is buying bitcoin with the intent of setting fire to their computer. Saving is also spending in the present. People who hold bitcoin and opt not to use them are spending an opportunity cost to consume in the moment in hopes for a greater ability to spend in the future. This is perfectly normal when the price of bitcoin is increasing so rapidly. Any attempt to dissuade people of this is utterly futile.
This leads me to my next point. How does a market based on bitcoin work? If one were to peruse reddit, the impression would be thus: Those who hold bitcoin are berated into using their wealth however the collective feels is most appropriate.
If you believe this is an appropriate way to organize an economy, I strongly urge you to pick up a copy of The Road to Serfdom by F. A. Hayek. (link to free copy) In it you will find that a sustainable economy requires the understanding that people will act however they are incentivized to act. That means that people who see the value of bitcoin increasing are incentivized to save. Arguing against this is futile.
It's important to understand that bitcoin will reach a market equilibrium. The price will stabilize eventually. At that point, spending will increase.
Those who insist on berating people into acting against their own rational self interest are only displaying 1) that they do not respect the rightful decisions of others to use their property as they see fit; and 2) that they do not understand the fundamentals of an economy.
Lastly, I see a lot of new people on asking for advice on buying bitcoins for the express purpose of making money in the short term (speculators). I also see a lot of posts on how to encourage people to adopt bitcoin. Then I see people berating speculators. I'll leave you to your own conclusions on that point.
Thanks for your time!
EDIT: I almost forgot. One of the most damaging things to an economy is irrational spending. (See again: Hayek on "the paradox of saving") Encouraging people to spend their money irrationally is actually harmful to the economy because it causes wealth to be used inefficiently.

I'm just playing devils advocate here.. but why would the avg person pay something for bitcoin and then immediately replenish what was spent? Each transaction would require double the effort...

One interesting post I found where he describes the economic properties of bitcoin:
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
and one special, magical property:
- can be transported over a communications channel
If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.
I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.
(I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)"

One thing to know. If you ever buy in. and then suddenly see the price drop by a huge amount.. Do not panic and sell your coins.. This is how the markets work.. Most likely, in a few hours, or a few days or months it will be worth more than what you put into it.
