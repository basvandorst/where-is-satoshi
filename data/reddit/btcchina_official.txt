Thank you for your concern, the drive was initially started by a Bitcoin community charity, eternalspring.org. Our co-founder, Linke is both a friend of the organiser and Qi Yong, the miner currently suffering from leukaemia. We are collecting donations on their behalf and will then send all the donations to Qi Yong and to his family.
We are using our own Bitcoin address because we felt our users may be more comfortable donating to an address provided by a service they already use, and to encourage our own staff to donate. If you would prefer to donate directly to the address provided by the campaign, we encourage you to do so at the address provided here (the website is in Chinese): 
We hope everyone will participate regardless of the amount.
