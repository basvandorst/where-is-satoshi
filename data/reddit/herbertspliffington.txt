lowest price sometimes comes at a price

.... maybe a brief explanation as to how someone might go about trying to answer...?  Where do they go, what do they copy/paste, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:17:23
of course

Thanks for your reply, perhaps you might clarify just a little for me the following scenario:
If I bought 1 bitcoin for $100, then later bought a $1000 item for 1 bitcoin - I have never "converted it back to fiat".  
has implied it need not be reported, but I wonder if that is true...
Appreciate your input.

ok...true I guess that makes sense to encourage a bit of self research....
question 4 is the holdout I guess....
cool idea, thanks

Thank you for the explanation

monero and other cryptonote spinoffs will be right there to pick up the pieces...

make part of your screen capture a chat app...or maybe just put some text overlay on your screen to say where your chat forum is, or whatever, gotta think outside that mofo box yo :)

there's a few free ones around, just look for "virtual webcam"....one real quirky entry level one is webcammax, but its....i dunno....quirky....
good luck have fun - this streamium service, i'm quite laughing at the possibilities, it's crazy

aaaaand.....21inc suddenly makes you go hmmm...

just use virtual cam software for your screen. 
I'm playing my latest track and streaming my media player's screensaver here:
edit: and here's somethng funny to think about, I can capture someone else's stream and rebroadcast it for cheaper, lol
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:05:24
but....but......"brilliant" and "visionary", didn't you hear?
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:01:49
Of course it can be done - just use a virtual webcam software on the broadcaster's computer - done. 
I was streaming my desktop for a while, got no viewers tho :(

I'm sorry, I don't understand. If someone sends coins to my address, don't they just show up in the balance at that address?  How does one *decline* bitcoins sent to an address? The transaction gets confirmed, can I somehow stop that? Thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:44:52
What does it mean, "don't accept payments"? Can't anyone send coins to my address - how does one "not accept" ?
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:34:06
so, no to running a wallet on an air-gapped secret computer, now I should keep my wallet on a node-running online computer? honestly asking
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:27:28
You bought, held and got rich.  Then you went to buy a car, on the way to the dealership, you got struck by a bus and killed.  That's the other timeline.
In this reality, not having bought those coins is the reason you are still alive.
What-if's are silly, because they fail to take in all context.

it's an open source programming library, it contains useful functions related to transactions, signatures, etc.  
one would use it to build applications

When does this go until, please? 
I have something to buy!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:22:17
Thanks for the reply - if I miss it I'll just purchase at regular price with no issue.  
Kudos for boldly going...!
