I've written a step by step guide to customizing the touchbar with BTT before 
If you don't mind I'm going to add your gif there and instructions on how to add BTC prices

Beat me to posting this! It's great! Coinbase provides all you need to file taxes on your coins. Cost basis, FIFO method and a good export option

I support the hell out of this!
Many sites (bitcoinity, preev) are switching to mBTC by default. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:02:01
Eat there regularly...Was pleseantly surprised when they started to accept Bitcoin!

I was thinking the same thing, print out paper wallets or something. BTC gift cards hehe, I wish there was a site or something that would do it in a nice designed way
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:38:42
I actually did not give them anything, I posted the instructions to open a blockchain.info account, saying that it's easier then opening a facebook account. 
Also I told them to enable 2 factor auth, and  to send me their wallet address afterwards
And gave them a link to a bitcoint tutorial site :) 
They had to figure out some of the stuff on their own, and most ofd them did, the ones who got s a little confused, I helped out
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:48:02
Sure thing, open an account on blockchain.info, easy peasy :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:47:27
Whoah! great, I'm so happy this is spreading. I think this is absolutely the right time for these kind of actions, this will make bitcoin stronger.

I was thinking the same thing, but when my mom asked me to explain to her about bitcoin, and my fiancee's mom asked me to opena wallet for her, I decided to do this experiment, and I got proved wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:47:41
Indeed it does!
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:36:17
Heh, I've been to those faucet sites, they really do look like spam, like someone hacked your account. 
I don't know where you from in the world, but do you really need to remind them? My experience was, most of them at least heard the term BitCoin once by now
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:18:20
Oh and BTW, blockchain just added mBTC support, on their site (can't wait for when apps update)
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:11:59
Really? wow, I beleive it's easier in US then most places, due to coindesk and bank integration.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:50:02
You can still send an email to  here : 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:31:12
Sure, you can just register for a new wallet on blockchain.info and transfer the money from bitcointip there
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:09:48
Sent him as well, don't think he'll see it though, his inbox must be exploding at anygiven day
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:44:18
It's quite easy actually, just go to blockchain.info and sign up for a wallet. 
The in settings enable 2 factor auth 
and you have a bitcoin wallet :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:34:08
Heh, I'm glad it made you open up a wallet!!
I actually don't know how to tip via comments, although I help people with btc, I'm a relatively new redditor :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:45:45
Don't know about buying BTC in Canada, besides the first world Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver. But it's totally safe to open a wallet on blockchain.info just to learn what bitcoin is and how it's done.
You can later open another wallet if you feel that you didn't secure the first one, or didn't understand what it's all about in the beginning
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:10:59
Just posted it to all my social networks! This is great!
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:35:04
this is great! saving!
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:17:07
I'm working on an extension for that, to show mBTC prices, wherever I can, coinbase, bitstamp, preev, bitcoinity and others.
This is bugging me for ages, people don't want to buy because it's too high, even though in mBTC it's the same as a dollar
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:35:51
Can somebody explain what's the point of a service like this? Why would I need proof of ownership?
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:59:27
I had the same urge, dump my iPhone, to get a good native wallet app.
And I was still holding on to my ios6.1.2 because it's jailbroken and I installed the blockchain app from cydia.
But TIL that the blockchain app in the appstore, works 100%, even though they claim it has "clipped" functionality, so staying with iPhone

Well it's easy, this is a quote of what I posted -&gt;




it's really easier then it sounds, easier then opening a facebook account or a gmail account


just so you can understand what it's about, and play around with it.


And I gave them a link to blockchain. For most of them it was enough
