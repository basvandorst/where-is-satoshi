So you want cash and Bitcoin? That's the opposite if you ask me.

Great observation. Similar to "collateral damage" when talking about dead civilians, right? Professional deformation, Gavin or should I say CIA/Gavin or CIA+Gavin?

If there is a movie about Bitcoin, Charlie Sheen should play Craig Wright and Jim Carey should play Gavin Andresen.

Gavin CIA Andresen was the first big name who confirmed Wright is Satoshi. Coincidence?

Please, God, if you exist, make Charlie Lee the creator of Bitcoin too. Thank you.

Gavin is [Bitdumb](

I really hope Charlie will get the role to play Craig Wright, no matter if the movie will be about the real Satoshi or the "real" Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:31:13
Do you remember Satoshi's double-spacing after a period in his code? now look at the code of this scam artist Craig Wright.

If it's true we will have a great crime-technothriller/drama film, and we can have [Charlie]( to play Craig Wright, the main villain.

Gavin CIA/NWO Andresen was the first big name who confirmed Wright is Satoshi. Hmm...
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:41:52
Pure gold! ;D
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:20:08
Could be that he is willing to risk to get away from prison ;). Though, it would be funny if the real Satoshi would speak out after the Australian Gov. let him go ;D, if he isn't Satoshi for real, of course ;)
