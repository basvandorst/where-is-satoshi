I'm not arguing, just sharing how I've grown up in the states.  Pay rent with a check because with cash it's my word vs. a land owners that I paid, if they choose to accept my money and say otherwise in the legal system (were they to try to rip me off).  With the check my bank/credit union knows where the money went and it creates a history.  That is a pretty typical notion here, I believe anyhow.
Just as this may sound surprising, I'm surprised there are other methods widely used.  TIL...

Direct debit must mean use my debit card (like a credit card but only has access to your checking account)- because there is no way for me to use my debit card with my landlord- over here that would look like a point of sale machine where I 'swipe' my card.  I've not heard, used the term BACS either. Maybe it's all our religious conservatives afraid of getting beast marked that has kept us from other methods.  Maybe if I lived in an expensive condo I'd know these things too.  My landlord has an office on my block, I just drop a check (enveloped), in his letter slot and I'm done with it. I don't mind this as the 1950s (assuming we've contemporary social progress), we're headed toward extinction anyhow - check systems aren't the worst of our problems :)

American- I pay rent with checks as it leaves a trail that I can easily have my credit union follow.  Grew up being told someone could rip me off if I paid rent in cash, as there is no real receipt. Until now, here, I have not heard of chip &amp; pin.  Though, I also live in a town that is more forward thinking in it's energy use, while being really late to adopt a lot of the other global or North American technological trinkets.
