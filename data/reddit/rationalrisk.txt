That is exactly the case. Our bitcoin customers receive the quickest e-code delivery times!
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:23:31
Yes you can.

We actually just went live with our bitcoin discount at CardCash.com. Now bitcoin users automatically save an additional 2%. Passing back what we save on transaction fees back to the customer. Enjoy!

Hey Mike.
Eric here. I just sent you an email hopefully resolving your issue. I have issued a refund and also added in a gift on behalf of CardCash. I owe you a huge apology for the past 2 weeks. As you said, I always genuinely want to help CardCash's bitcoin customers with any issues and I go out of my way to handle any issues personally as our acceptance of bitcoin was my brain child. I had to take off from work for the past couple of weeks to deal with a personal issue and your issue got lost in the shuffle. Its no excuse and I sincerely apologize.
If you ever need anything in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I am also active on reddit with this handle.
Again my apologies,
- Eric

No longer the case.

Unfortunately you cannot at this time. Its on the roadmap though.

CardCash.com is now live with accepting bitcoin payments. E-gift cards are usually delivered in under a minute. They carry over 1100 retailers and currently have 500+ retailers in stock. App is due out at the end of the month.

It is a secondary market. But 80% of cards are converted to e-cards and delivered usually in under 30 min. Physical cards are being phased out. Bitcoin purchases will be instant delivery because there are no chargebacks. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:16:03
It is effectively instant buy! e-cards are delivered by email in usually under a minute with bitcoin.

Thank you for pointing that out. CardCash now no longer emails your password in plain text.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:21:07
Thanks for letting everyone know! There where some bugs we had to iron out but we seem to have fixed them all. You can now effectively use bitcoin at over 1100 retailers nation wide. If anyone does end up having an issue while using bitcoin feel free to message me and I'll make sure its taken care off.

Great points. You're completely correct. We actually carry over 1300 retailers. Currently we only have 670 in stock but we are constantly updating. We carry any retailer that offers gift cards and has 15+ locations. We will soon be going live with exclusive discount for Bitcoin users, passing back value to our customers from the lower transaction fees. Keep an eye out!

I can confirm this. CardCash will be offering a
standard extra discount for bitcoin users passing back the savings on transaction fees.

In the US you can now buy discounted gift cards at CardCash.com with bitcoin. They carry over 1000 retailers like KFC and digital gift cards are instantly delivered. Its now easy to buy almost anything with bitcoin.
