This isnt a chart showing the price of goods and the average salary. This chart shows real wages going up which means people can buy more stuff.

Three questions: What do you imagine will happen when the bitcoin rewards are finally finished? In the event that it doesn't work out what would be the problem with switching the code to continue to issue new bitcoin? Are there any altcoins that have reached this point?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:51:04


When you say "we" we're talking about us. We will achieve a higher standard of living by cooperating in society. Is that such an injustice? And is it not worth the benefit? 


And so companies will buy the river they pollute and does that solve the problem? Who owns the air and the ocean? It's hard for me to imagine how that would work out.

He's referring to the scarcity and liquidity of bitcoins and he probably wanted to use a contemporary example. "Beany babies" was probably the second choice but they aren't relavent anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-17 01:57:26
Being immortal kind of reduces the problem of scarcity. Everyone has all the time in the world to get what they want. Why not blow their money today and work for 1000 years to get it back.  
I doubt people would find a currency that appreciates in value very useful if people never let it go and the value kept skyrocketing, but i don't think that would happen. 
Value is stored so you can use it in the future to satisfy wants and needs. If your future is infinite, you can never store enough value. You may as well satisfy your wants as they come and go.
Edit: i misunderstood. If you need money to live you would probably want to keep that and kill other people for their money kind of like highlander.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:36:23
Bitcoin is backed by the belief that someone else is willing to trade something for it. In reality, value is subjective and there is no need back anything. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:48:50
Well that's encouraging.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:00:44
That's harsh.
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:03:38
If the price doesnt matter why are you so upset about this article not bringing on mass adoption? Bicoin works just fine either way.
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:08:53
Are any of your peers using bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:50:06
OP? This thread is so snarky. Anyway, I would like to see more compelling evidence that the network is growing. This would make me happy.

Very cool. It would be cool if you could create teaser to intice viewers. Does it do that?
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:13:02
Yeah, but what about the part about the network growing? I think the better example would be the amount of tx

You're welcome. I like the Anarchist definition better but there's the free rider problem.

This is why it's important to have an independent agency with the primary goal of keeping this from happening.

Here's an interesting talk on the matter: 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:21:42
We shouldnt force teachers and doctors to do anything. we should pay them because education is positive externality and a benefit to society. That is, it makes a better situation for everyone to live in a place where people are healthy and educated. 
An example of a negative externality is polution. If i'm making money, i dont care if the river is on fire, but that sucks for people near the river.
Edit: see 
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:37:57
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:20:20
Yeah, and that creates upward pressure. Gox had the most volume and they had a bot buying 10-20 btc every 5 mins. I've never seen any proof of a significant Chinese bitcoin community. I'm tired of this sub just upvoting what they want to hear.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:34:15
I like Andreas but the amount of times he has been wrong attempting to predict the future is actually kind of funny. Specifically, I remember him claiming China was going to leave the US behind by being open to bitcoin (on LTB) a day before China announced their first "ban" of bitcoin. There's a ton of examples if you go back and listen to the older podcast.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:21:59
If large miners collude they can do anything they want anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-27 06:30:08
I remember gox being a few hundred dollars above every other exchange and acting erratic. I personally think the china adoption story is bs but i'll look into it.
@_date: 2015-08-27 04:48:59
@_date: 2015-08-15 05:25:05
Ok, i see the cpi moving up and the average hourly wage moving up(which is adjusted for inflation i assume) each person is much better off than they were years ago and no one can argue that. Your data just proves my point.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:08:58
That sounds like a lot of hype. People were just repeating what they heard and trying to get investors excited. I think we'll discover soon that Chinese adoption was overblown. Exchanges can fake their volume. And there's no way you can say that the willy bot "didn't do shit". 
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:27:31
I dont think you've found some great injustice of the world. Inflation can be good for an economy. Hyperinflation is the bad stuff. There are plenty of alternatives to bitcoin that can help preserve your wealth.
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:47:44
It's almost as if they were playing along with your joke.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:23:13
Would it be possible to have the blocksize increase with the amount of time that has passed between blocks? This would mean larger blocks would be more risky for miners with a better payoff?
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:18:29
If i expected gox to recover(as many did) I would have bought btc on another exchange for cheap and sold it on gox. My bitcoin would likely get bought up at top dollar by the willy bot or someone desperate to leave which would drive up the price.
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:32:49
So, no one saw gox as an arbitrage opportunity? Gox never said they would get rid of fiat withdrawals all together.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:08:04
It's has almost the same valuation as bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:07:45
Relax Mr. PHD. I don't agree with 's post but I find your mean spirited post to be a lot less valuable.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:16:02
I respect what you're doing. This sub is too polarized against imaginary shills/trolls. I've even been acused of being a changetip shill. 
Thank you for spending hours doing more for this community than the people who are throwing acusations.
@_date: 2015-04-13 01:53:26
Well if you're revived you've got more time. Think of it like cpr. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:00:37
I first heard about bitcoin through the winklevoss twins :/
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:06:32
Are you talk about [this]( 
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:00:06
Ok, I didn't think that was what he was trying to say. In that case he's wrong. Bitcoin isn't easy to hack. But i think bitcoin security is a real problem keeping people out.

There are a lot of smart people who fit this description. I don't think debt is a measure of intelligence.

Well they should at least stop browsing reddit.

Awesome, I always miss out on these threads. I'm kind of confused as to how this works. I'd like my tip to go to the Alzeimer's Association.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:11:32
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:18:38
Well in that case they should at least direct you to some place you can spend coins. Like "where do I spend my tips?" link.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:04:35
I don't think that's a fair rebuttal. Let's be real. People lose bitcoins to hacks.
@_date: 2015-02-15 06:11:29
Just curious, how do you handle market failures like externalities without a government?
Edit: Wow thanks, i love the level headed responses I'm getting for asking a simple question.
@_date: 2015-02-15 08:15:34
Sounds like you need regulation.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:12:42
I really hope they open source the bitcoin integration they were planning. I would use it. There's nothing stopping anyone from making a reddit fork.

Well if you're tipping with monikers it's generally a bit more but anyway things add up. It's like a point system anywhere else. You don't get 1 point and wonder where you can cash in on it or one flyer mile and try to book a flight.
