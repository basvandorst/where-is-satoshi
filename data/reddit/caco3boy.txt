All transactions on-chain are traceable right now. When you open a channel you will have an on-chain transaction which will be visible, but transactions on the LN will not be visible on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is not anonymous but it is more private. Also there are confidential transactions coming to Bitcoin for anonymity, as well as there could likely be an anonymous Bitcoin sidechain(mimblewimble)

The thing is, the hacker can't just put the money onto the exchange and swap the BTC for USD/EUR.
So i don't think nicehash hack will have any impact on the price. The hacker could try to exchange it for anon currency such as monero or zcash though. But even then, services like shapeshift will usually blacklist such trades.

No need to thank him. You could donate.

I've actually seen it somewhere else. Nonetheless, did you expect a credit or something?

It's true. He reads papers.
He owns a flip phone. (do you even imagine someone in these days without a smart phone. You'd doubt if they use computer too)

Why didn't we see this back then :(

The thing is many people are waiting in the line to buy. And what's happening is, the price just seems to be climbing up so they say f# it and buy into it, as they realize they will only be able to buy it for more, if they don't buy now.
Whether a correction comes we will see.

How about "donating" some of these funds for the development of Bitcoin/Lightning Network. In the end it will raise the price of your Bitcoins, they will be worth more and you will be able to donate more to charities. Why not fund the development? There are only a few people working on LN...

I agree there are many good coins. But there are 1300 currencies. 99% of them are total crap

Well if they print 50M of Tethers and put it to leverage x10 this makes 500M of buy pressure which surely counts?

Merchants can not afford the volatility, not me.
If i don't use it, then noone will use it and it will be a speculative asset with no utility forever. As more and more people begin to use it, that's when it becomes a bubble that never pops.
Store of value is not a compelling argument as a use case at this point, because it's a purely speculative investment.
Also i can't take FIAT from my real wallet and throw it into the computer to pay.

Where is the transaction data of LN stored? Does each node store the log or how does it work?

Okay. So amount in your wallet will still be fully transparent, but it will be hard to track your transactions?
Right now there is a path and they can track your transactions. This would "shuffle" transactions and you would not be able to determine from whom did it really come from and wouldn't be able to actually track payments?

Well there is a lot of volatility and merchants want a stable currency.... 
Bitcoin is not(yet) usable as a currency due to the volatility, so i think it's reasonable and expectable of the merchants to liquidate the bitcoins into FIAT.
I just use it as a means of payment/exchange, if more people continue to do so and it gets used, it'll get more stable over time and perhaps if everyone pays in Bitcoins and if they can pay their supplier in bitcoin and if the price is rather stable, that's when they will not have to liquidate into FIAT from business perspective.... But we are not there yet...
