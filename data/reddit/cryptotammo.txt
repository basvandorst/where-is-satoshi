Thanks. Love the insights with Switzerland as an example.

It is currently under development.

I don't feel too great about the economic future too. Think about these negative interest rates. I some countries you even get paid if you borrow money for a house. It's insane. Example:

I agree. I would love to live in a more thoughtful world in which people consume less. 
Better for our natural resources too.

Great quote, Love it! Better to save money than to waste money.

This price increase is outrageous. Coinbase is literally saying: GO AWAY, we don't want small customers! 
I believe Coinbase already anticipated that many small customers will leave and I think they didn't overestimate customer loyalty. They know this increase will cause small and more time consuming customers to leave. They probably think this is a WIN and will secretly celebrate this as a victory. 
Btw I WAS a GDAX/Coinbase Pro fan.

Yes, I believe they failed too. Since 1913 the Dollar lost 96,13% of its purchasing power. Absolute madness.

Ok, than Coinbase has some work to do.
Thanks for sharing this glitch.

I wondered too and it motivated me to do a bit of research. I found out that there are almost twice as many -10%-dips as +10%-peaks and since december 2017 there were more than 3 times as many -10% dips as +10%-peaks... probably due to crypto winter and future contracts that launched on 10 december 2017. Btw I only looked into Kraken's data starting 2014 and I had to use the average daily USD-prices (not closing prices).

Funny, it seems they only accept cash and that the crypto stuff is only decorational... I checked their Google reviews. Here's one of them=&gt; Food was good: taste, aroma and look was satisfactory. Ruined the experience by the environment. It was hot inside. AC isn't enough to support the whole restaurant. Interior is interesting. Please remember that it's a cash only place.

Yes, it certainly isn't a bad start. Btw i think it would be good to look at this at a national level too. I wouldn't be surprised if there are already a few nations in which the 3.5% adoption threshold has crossed.

Wow, is this real?
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:51:44
Yes, will spread the word! Btw great sign.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:38:00
Interesting, didn't know that. Thnx.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:54:56
Thanks but it doesn't scare me at all. I shared it to point out there have been days like these before. To point out it's normal and that there's nothing to worry about. Bitcoin has been called dead many times.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:56:55
Yes, that would be a great addition... however I would probably want the comparison with  the weeks/months after each fall. We will see it's not so bad after all.. just rainy days in summer.

You can't know how much people are actively using bitcoin but if you really need a number you could make a very rough estimate by using the amount of wallets. I believe there are around 42 million bitcoin wallets now. That's only 0,5% on a world population of 7,7 billion people. Btw I expect that the active user percentage is actually much lower because I expect that there are more wallets than active users. I myself for example have multiple wallets.
I would recommend to look at [this study]( the university of Cambridge did in December 2018. They revealed that there were at least 35 million ID-verified users in 2018. However it seems they approached this by looking at the total amount of users (all crypto assets) and not BTC specific.

Nah, don't think so. This is just a rainy day in summer. Winter will start after the next halving, mid 2020.
