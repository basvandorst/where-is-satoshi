so you want to restrict it even more?
You may consider it to be JUST digital gold, I personally use it for purchases.
If you don't understand what the fees are for I suggest you go read up on it. Fees have nothing to do with bitcoin's "status" as digital gold.

This is ridiculous.
If coinbase can affect the Bitcoin Mempool to this extent just because they don't batch transactions or use segwit, the flaw is in Bitcoin, not coinbase.
What you're saying is that anyone who uses bitcoin and has a large number of transactions has to batch transactions and use segwit or they'll be attacked (in some form) by users, when in reality, this is simply the way the protocol works.

The same can be said for any cryptocurrency, without mass adoption it is essentially worthless.
BTW, the reason BCH has a 30B marketcap is because the majority of people who have BCH are people who got them for free from the split, and haven't sold them. I have BCH too, I'm not an idiot, and I believe that both coins can coexist, but I also believe Bitcoin is going to be the superior coin with better functionality.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:57:53
Then I suggest you calmly wait for LN to be implemented, at which time the fees will be much lower.
You're complaining there is no solution, but there is, and it's what's been discussed for over a year, and it's one of the reasons segwit was implemented in the first place, to allow implementing Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:00:54

never said it was a joke, I said it's a misleading title.
Title implies they'll get paid 1 BTC per month, when there's no mention of that anywhere in the article. Quite the opposite, the company will pay **UP TO** $1200 per month.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:03:29
The temporary solution was discussed ad nauseum and rejected.
It wasn't just rejected by the core developers, it was rejected by the community.
Those that didn't agree, moved to BCH when it forked.
If you stayed with BTC, then you automatically agreed to wait for LN.
Over the past month, there were plenty of times when the mempool was particularly low, and fees were also low, if you disagreed with where BTC is headed, you could have cashed out then.
In fact, you can still cash out now.
That said, if you don't cash out, you're agreeing to stick to the plan, so complaining for the sake of complaining doesn't help.
PS. This isn't a hostile response, nor was my question hostile, I was actually trying to ascertain the purpose of your post.

So how do you explain the dumping of bitcoin and ridiculous bch pump hours before the coinbase announcement?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:29:20
Please read up on how fees work.
Fees are not associated to the price of bitcoin other than 1 satoshi will obviously go up in price along with bitcoin.
Fees are calculated based on how many transactions are in the mempool.
It could happen that bitcoin price raises so high that a single satoshi does cost $300.
If you had a transaction fee of 1 satoshi then would you still complain?
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:34:55

you can build the best car the world has ever seen. If all people hear is that it is crap and the competitor's car is better, that's the one they'll buy.
Same with bitcoin. If all people hear are the multiple interviews Roger is doing, then those people buy bch instead of btc. Pretty soon the miners see all the people using bch instead of btc and simply stop mining btc. Remember, the miners are in it for the profit. If there's nobody to sell btc to, they'll simply go to where they can sell bch.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:06:18
ah ok, so you keep btc in their wallet, and their wallet has some kind of connection to their prepay card, and you can convert "on the fly" (30 second delay).

That's exactly, it.
Basically, just make sure you're nano is set with segwit, and when you need to send/receive, do it from another segwit address (ie. from the exchange which has segwit - like bitstamp)
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:43:40
you should be able to do it with a python script making calls to your local bitcoind (assume where you have your wallet)
That said, although you can do it, seems a bit wasteful in regards to the fees, but entirely up to you.

So...I'm sorry but how stupid are you to invest in something you don't like to begin with?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:28:06
That transaction doesn't show up on blockchain at all
According to the fee and transaction size, you paid 31 sat/byte, WAY below minimum to get a transaction confirmed in current mempool.
I think there's also been reports of transactions with very low fees being dropped, which may have been the case.
You may want to check the sending address on blockchain.info as well, but at a guess, the transaction won't appear there, so the money should be back in your originating address, if not now, then soon.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:26:44
Cheers, much more informative reply :)
Actually just moved from breadwallet to my ledger as I was typing this.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:23:39
current median fee is 135 sat/byte, you used less than half that, so it may still take a while.
If I recall, everytime your wallet rebroadcasts the transaction, it takes 72hours for it to fail.
You may be better off cancelling the rebroadcast (if possible), and send it with higher fees next time it fails.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:45:37
Your post is incoherent... what are you trying to say?

Depends if you're hodling or transacting.
If transacting, then you're right, it sucks.
If you're hodling and just moving between wallets, then it's largely irrelevant. It's a one time fee which will be more than made up by the price going up.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:29:16
Nah, you had a decent fee in place, probably just took a while to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:55:04
that card is prepaid though. That means you lose the benefit of bitcoin price changes.
ie. load card with £100 worth of bitcoin (0.01). Meanwhile, price goes up, so your £100 pounds would have been worth 0.015 if you hadn't converted it. Beyond the high fees they're charging you per transaction, they get the benefits of the bull market, while you lose out in fees and potential gains.
What the market needs is a card that has access to a wallet, and converts "on the fly".  That gives the user the freedom to choose when to buy something (because bitcoin is up), or not to buy (because bitcoin is down).
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:02:18
The estimated time, is just that, an estimate.
Within that 8 hour window, thousands of transactions could have been made with higher fees, which would push yours down the list.
I believe the median transaction fee right now is around 250-300 sat/byte so you'll probably need to wait until those clear before yours goes through.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:44
Fair enough, to be fair, I was moving to the ledger anyway, nothing to do with breadwallet.
From the use I got out of it, it worked fine, and if it wasn't just a case that I don't like having my bitcoin on my phone, I'd probably still be using it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:25:59

If you have less than 1mb of transactions in the mempool, they'll all be processed regardless of fees.
However, once blocks (1mb) are full, we then have a queue.
People can choose to pay more so that miners pick up their transaction faster.
Obviously, a miner faced with choosing a transaction with a fee of $5 or a fee of $50, will always pick the one with higher fees.
As the mempool goes down, the transactions with high fees are processed, and then the miners start processing the transactions with lower fees.

The rebuttal is that yes, the block size puts a limit on bitcoin's utility, right now. But there are roadmaps in place to fix that.
Bitcoin Cash came about because people want to buy coffee with bitcoin right now, without waiting for the roadmap to come into effect.
What they forget is that there isn't enough merchant adoption, for bitcoin or bitcoin cash, that buying a coffee is even an option for most of the world. Sure you have a couple of places here and there that accept btc or bch, but they're a minority.
So in essence, rather than waiting for a proper scaling solution, they forked off with an unsustainable solution, to buy coffees that don't exist because hardly anyone accepts crypto yet.

TBH I think the major concern that most countries have with money laundering is that they're losing taxes.
Obviously, by preventing money laundering, they're technically making it easier for law enforcement to catch "bad people".
Drug dealer sells a bunch of drugs and gets $1 million. Now he can't exactly say where the money comes from without being busted for drug dealing, nor can he go around spending it, or anyone watching will wonder where the money is coming from. So they "launder" the money (ie. buy bitcoins), to make it look like the money is legitimate. If anyone asks: oh, I invested in bitcoin 10 years ago when it was dirt cheap, that's why I have gazillions in my account.
In the end, it comes down to: Should criminals be allowed to benefit from the money they earned by carrying out illegal activities?

There's a reason bitcoin is often compared to gold as a safe haven. They're both decentralised. On top of that, bitcoin is digital. Even if it was banned in a country, the people in that country can still buy bitcoins online, and spend them with anyone who accepts them. All it would mean is that sellers couldn't publicise the fact that they accept bitcoins. But again, just like gold, it's nearly impossible to completely ban it since it would just create a black market for it.

There's no way to know if it's a scam. It could actually be legit. That said, it's very high risk, and unless he's offering some absurd amount of money that you're willing to lose your account, reputation, and possibly get all your other accounts hacked, then I'd say to stay the hell away from that deal. Anyway I look at it, I don't see any angle in which that person is being honest. Even if he's being truthful about using the account to buy cheaper bitcoins, he's still scamming LBC itself.

Personally, I don't think it needed to be tweeted at all. But the reality is, the bug was public from the moment they merged it. That said, Todd is a grown man, with his own opinions, so he's free to tweet what he likes.

Unlike some, who like to be jerks to everyone coming in here, I'll give you my point of view.
I believe in Bitcoin, and I think the technology is sound, regardless of the hurdles we're going through right now.
I've seen bitcoin at $200, then tank, then $1000, then tank. But it always has a tendency to come back stronger.
It really comes down to this. If you believe in the future of bitcoin, hang in there. If you don't, then you should probably sell.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:10:29

No, the Pi Zero W is considerably less powerful than the Pi 3.
It has only 512mb RAM, and the processor runs at a flat 1Ghz, also the Pi 3 is 64 bit.
All that said, it appears to run fine so far.

you're forgetting something. There's a thing called independent candidates.
One of the slaves could have put himself forward to be the new owner of the plantation, and have the other slaves vote for him.
Your logic while sound, is flawed because voting for a government is not as black and white as voting for bad or worse. Everyone always has the option of running for office if they think they can do a better job (except in fascist countries of course).
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:26:51
Tbh, I don't see how it is any different than what's happened before with bitcoin. This is a work in progress, and there will be many more hurdles to jump in the future.
That doesn't mean they're not worth jumping.
If anything, the fact that the issues of the past have been overcome, to me, it means that bitcoin is here to stay.
Don't forget, there's a $20B cap right now. Thousands of people have their millions invested here. Bitcoin isn't going away, it's here to stay.

You assume everyone here is American :)

Tbh, it serves them right for keeping large amounts of bitcoins on a networked device. As you said, it would be temporary, and the rest of us hodlers would bounce back eventually. With the side benefit that we'd be able to buy more cheap bitcoins :)

You edited your previous comment, so mine no longer makes any sense :)
In any event, it's now clear you're referring to the centralisation of hashing power, with which I wholeheartedly agree.
The advent of ASICs brought on the creation of mining "corporations" and mining pools, where the owners can collude to pretty much define the future of bitcoin.
Regardless of what other people may think, centralisation of mining, while assuming hashing power as a vote for the future of bitcoin, was not what was envisioned for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:10:41
You're like a dog with a bone.
Conversations evolve also. I said Satoshi appeared to be aware of the issue based on the other comment you linked.
In the end it comes back to the same point, Asic mining is bad for decentralisation, regardless of whether Satoshi knew, planned, was aware, wasn't aware, or had wet dreams about it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:27:25
I would argue that they expected computers to evolve, and improve, I don't think he could or would have expected people to create expensive specialised machines to mine bitcoins.
I'd even argue that he would have been against the way mining works today, since the specialisation of hardware has centralised the mining process.
Originally, everyone had the ability to have a mining node. Now only large mining operations can do it.
Pretty sure Satoshi didn't plan for that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:04:56
Drawing conclusions based on conjecture and assumptions is what lead us to this mess in the first place.
Ver assumed core is controlled by blockstream.
rBitcoin assumes Jihan is controlling BU.
rBTC assume core and rBitcoin is "evil".
rBitcoin assume rBTC are idiots.
I could go on and on.
If everyone stopped throwing mud and actually tried to solve the issues, we'd all be a lot richer.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:26:38
that last transaction is from December...has nothing to do with the transaction you're referring to...
Since you have a bitcoin wallet, if you provide the public address, I'm sure someone can see what's going on in the blockchain.
Or you can check it yourself at blockchain.info. just type in your public address into the search field.

@_date: 2017-03-15 08:13:23
I never said the developers were nonchalant. I was referring to the BU community as a whole, which keeps downplaying the bug because "all software has bugs".
yes all software has bugs, but they can be minimised with proper reviewing. Letting a bug that could have been caught in review out into the wild when dealing with financial systems is irresponsible. Then blaming someone for simply commenting on it (which if you look at any comment from the BU community, everyone is blaming Peter Todd for the tweet instead of the devs for not reviewing their cod), is just malicious.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:46:23
you're a poor candidate for giving people advice if you're going to criticise like that.
we want people to invest in bitcoin, and when they do, we should explain to them that the best thing to do is just hodl and relax.
telling them they shouldn't be investing in bitcoin just because they got a little spooked with the first downspike they see is not the way to go.

They can complain all they want. Bitcoin is global, there's nothing anyone can do about it. If they try to regulate it, it will simply go underground :)
And again, even if people are complaining, it doesn't give you the right to basically tell them to go away, that bitcoin is only for the elite. It's not, it's for everyone. If they want to invest, it's their choice, and their problem if it doesn't go well, it's not up to you to save them, all you can do is tell them this is normal, instead of scaring people away from bitcoin.
I'd even argue that by scaring people away from bitcoin, you're feeding into governments trying to regulate it. They can just say "look, even this guy thinks it's bad, he's advising people not to invest".

I don't understand their need for this.
If I have 100 euro/dollars/pounds, I can go to the street corner and pay a drug dealer for cash.
If the drug dealer gets busted a week from now, there's no way to know where that money came from, so technically, it's anonymous.
Why do they want to stop bitcoin's anonymity (which doesn't really exist even to that extent since it's possible to track transactions - something you can't do with fiat), when they don't do it with fiat?

I'd say anything above 3% is going to be a blocker for a large number of people. I know it's comparing apples and oranges, but the reality is, the majority of mainstream are looking for a way of doing micro-payments etc, like they do now with payment processors. most online processors I believe charge around 3-4% so if the tx fee is higher than that, why would mainstream adopt bitcoin?

Not factoring in the "Why the fuck would a slave continue to whip the other slaves".
Yes, by voting someone into office, you are saying that you trust the decisions that person will make while they are in office.
So yes, you gave consent for any action they took.
Of course if you disagree with those actions to the point you no longer want that person in office, you can always impeach them. 
In a worst case scenario, there's always the option of a coup d'état.
In the end, calling a government criminal doesn't make sense, since the people voted them into power, and the people have the power to remove them.

At the end of the day, laws differ country to country, including exchange regulations. What may be valid to your understanding in the USA, may not be required in other countries.
USA is the country of lawsuits, you'll find that the rest of the world doesn't sue over spilt coffee.
Regardless of what someone calls a cryptocurrency, they're buying it at a set price, which will go up or down.
If someone buys "bitcoin" at a price of $600, and didn't do their due diligence which would have found another "bitcoin" at $1200, then that's their own problem, and I doubt any court outside the USA would even consider such a case of technological semantics as the length of a blockchain or hashrate.

Well, generally speaking, I think that most people who run nodes, do it because they want to, and are trying to be a bit altruistic, or just for fun.
For myself, it's just to see what I could do with it.
For a cheap version you could buy the Pi Zero for £10 + 128 GB for £25, so total cost £35 and you'd be set.
In the end, if people only ran bitcoin nodes because they got something out of it, we wouldn't have a bitcoin network at all.

So, you're saying that if Steve Jobs had noticed that Microsoft created a patch for something, and simply went on twitter to comment about it, it was then his obligation to also include instructions on how to download said patch?
You realize twitter has a character limit?
It is the responsibility of BU to publish those instructions, not any random person who happens to read their git updates and comments about it on twitter.

In case anyone is wondering, these are the reviews from the BU patch.
It's normal to have some formatting fixes, but that level of formatting fixes screams junior developers to me.
Even leaving aside the formatting issues (since they don't necessarily break anything), some of the review comments demonstrate that the developers, while certainly knowledgeable, are often "hacking" things together, or not checking the "big picture" when making localised changes.

    Various small things, but two big ones:
    1/ The core code already use a mix of Allman braces and Egyptian. Adding GNU style makes Bu looks bad.
    2/ This PR is a kitchen sink. Small and focused PR is a must have for high quality code review, reversibility and so on. I made the case on PR164 and it was ignored with the consequences we know of. I'm disappointed to see that no lesson has been learned (either here or in the PV PR, where I made pretty the same comment).

Hate to break it to you, but this is neither google, nor hackerone.


The team had so much time to publish a remediation that they did, it was merged to git, where the attacker found the issue.

You're claiming BU support is a bluff, you actually have no idea if it's a bluff or not, unless Jihan himself told you. And yes, you also don't know if Ver is taking bribes.
So finalising, you financial analysis is fine, but your conclusions are conjecture.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:18:13
I did read, and what you're saying makes no sense. The blockchain is held at nodes, nodes are everywhere. There is no majority, there's just nodes. Some are using 0.14, some are using BU, but they all hold the blockchain, so while my reading is fine, maybe the issue is with your writing or understanding of the blockchain or of what majority control is.
Unless of course your referring to mining, which has nothing to do with what you wrote.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:38:36
You assume that nobody else saw the merge, and that the attackers actually got their info from twitter and not from git.
Again, it proves my point though. The fact that it was posted on twitter is irrelevant. The issue at hand is that poor reviewing lead to the existence of the bug in the first place.

Satoshi had a great idea, do you really expect him to have thought of everything?
It's one thing to create the ideas behind a new system, it's entirely another to consider all of the millions of ways it may be abused.
In the future, we could even see someone building a specialised supercomputer to do the hashing, and with a single computer take over 100% of hashing power.
Do you think he intended that? Just because it's possible, doesn't mean it was intended.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:14:50
Proposed something similar a couple of days ago.
I don't see how the current system of hash power = votes can be considered fair, when you have a few large mining operations able to carry the vote.
There's millions of people investing and using bitcoins, but only a small minority able to vote. If that's not centralised, I don't know what is.
People will say that the miners should be the voters because they are risking their investment.  I disagree with that. Not only do they have a much higher ROI than we could ever dream of, we risk our money with a very real chance of losing it completely, where they have already recovered their investment many times over, and in a worst case scenario, their mining equipment can always be sold, whereas bitcoin holders have no recourse if the price drops or bitcoin fails.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:25:53
Well, I'm actually trying to understand your point. And I do understand your logic, blocking china certainly would stabilize bitcoin, at the cost of hash power, and it would probably eradicate the segwit vs bitcoin issue overnight.
That said, from seeing your comments on the same topic on other posts, it seems to me, this isn't the justification you're using. It appears to me that you're on a vendetta against china for them blocking OTHER US tech rather than any perceived benefit it would bring to bitcoin.
To me, it then reasons that you are American, and have forgotten that the world is not just the USA. (Most of the rest of the world couldn't care less whether China blocks US tech or not).
Even forgetting that bitcoin is meant to be decentralized and unregulated (which you would them be destroying - by creating a rule that China couldn't use it).
What you're suggestion would open the door for someone to come here at some stage and say that the USA should be blocked, or some other random country.
Who has the right to decide that for bitcoin? Even if you were able to get a consensus on it, it is something that should never be done. In one fell swoop, you'd destroy all the credibility of bitcoin, since nobody would trust it to still be available in any given county.

Or perhaps I just liked the form factor, and when I got it decided to try to build a node.

I can appreciate it'll be difficult to do, and even more difficult to roll out, but I think we're at a stage where we need to take the initiative to improve bitcoin for the better.  An added benefit would be an improvement of community relations, which are at an all time low right now, largely because people in feel they don't have a voice, so decided to create their own solution.

spending (ie. buying stuff) with bitcoin, again, doesn't count because bitcoin is not considered a currency. As far as the government is concerned, someone just "gave you" that new Lamborghini outside. (Though you will be liable for whatever motor tax is applicable in your country).

Kraken is an exchange, where you can buy and sell bitcoin.
A hard fork is a blockchain engineering term. It means that a new version of the software/protocol is so different that nodes which haven't upgraded will not be able to validate blocks on it. Basically it means that old nodes would continue with the older version of the blockchain and new nodes would work on the new version, effectively creating a new altcoin.
Caveat: I'm a noob as well, so someone more experience may be able to clarify it better, or say if I'm pulling this out of my arse.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:22:07
This is an extreme over simplification.
You need to think of bitcoin not as money, but as an agreement.
Imagine that everyone that is running a node, has a printer that has printed out every single transaction that has ever happened in bitcoin. 
Then there are the bitcoin miners who receive a transaction request, do a lot of math to confirm that the transaction request is real and send it to the guys with the nodes.
So then you have your paper wallet, that is composed of 2 keys: a private key (think of it as a password), and a public key (think of it as an account number).
When you want to perform a transaction, you call up the guy with the nearest node (ie printed sheets of transactions), and tell him you want to send some bitcoin to your friend's public key (account number, remember?).
So the guy with the node, reads through all the millions of sheets with transactions, confirms that you do indeed have the bitcoin which you purchased at some point (and created a transaction), and sends the request to the miner so that the miner can send it on to all the other thousands of guys with nodes so it can be printed out.
So now, there's an agreement, that is present in all those thousands of nodes, that you gave x amount of bitcoin to your friend. So now, those bitcoins are associated to his account number, and not yours.

I've been running a pruned node (0.14.0) on rPi zero w for over a week, going nicely.
But even nicer would be for bitcoin's community to work together to solve the scaling issue so things can get back to "normal".
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:23:29
I never used the word censorship, you did.
As for the rules, I'm just looking for clarification, since the community guidelines are not quite clear.
For example, I previously wrote the same post, but used the words b*nned, m*deration, and c*nsorship, and that post was removed.
It did not use a url shortening service, it did not ask for bitcoins, it wasn't about another crypto currency, another client software which doesn't comply with concensus, there was no referral link, it wasn't a compilation of bitcoin sites, a trade, a repetition of anything (as far as I could find), and it didn't include any bitcoin addresses. And although it wasn't about bitcoin directly, it is about the rules of this sub, so I don't think it is off topic.
So as you can see above, if my previous post didn't infringe on the guidelines and was still removed, then the guidelines should probably be updated.
I've had other posts removed, some which I agree were against the guidelines, but others which weren't.
I'm not arguing against the rules, I'm just asking for clarity.
But it wouldn't hurt to lighten up a bit as well.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:39:01
Well, to be fair, I'm just looking for clarification of the rules, if I happen to be banned for it, well, that's a form of clarification too.

That is the sad state in some countries unfortunately, but I don't believe it's true everywhere.

That's a childish attitude to follow. In the end, we all want bitcoin to succeed, but there are two trains of thought. It's not that complicated to sit down and try to come up with a solution.
A solution may not be easy to find, but any attempt would be better than the mud slinging exercises that are going on with both sides right now.

May have a bug, yes. That's a far cry from the doom and gloom of "it's buggy".
And you're absolutely right, nobody should be running it until it has been reviewed properly and merged into core.
Everyone running it now is doing so at their own risk, since it **is not part of core** until it has been reviewed and merged.

@_date: 2017-03-20 08:17:02
Something people are forgetting is that when bitcoin came out, there was only cpu mining, and each bitcoin client was effectively a mining node.
There was no concept of ASICs or that when they came out they would be so expensive as to effectively centralize mining into a few large mining operations.
Voting at the time bitcoin was viable because all nodes had the potential to be mining nodes, with hash power to vote with.
Bringing back CPU mining effectively brings back voting power to the community, instead of just a couple of corporate miners.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:51:06
Thank you for a straight forward unbiased answer!
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:48:47
I think you're mistaken in your concept of what bitcoin should be.
I don't have a formed opinion regarding the scaling debate itself, don't quite understand it to be honest, but I did follow the progress of bitcoin since 2010, and here is my opinion on that:
Nobody ever said bitcoin was only for savings, or high end investment. Bitcoin was always meant to be an alternate currency, with the end view of replacing fiat currency altogether at some distant point in the future.
So yes, people should be able to go and buy a coffee, or pay for groceries with bitcoin.
Just because they should be able to do this, doesn't mean it should become centralised, and in this we agree, the main point of bitcoin is decentralisation, but to think that it's main defining property is to be a savings account is just wrong.
Also saying that other alt coins should step in to fill the role of micropayments would just add value to those alt coins while devaluing the bitcoin. Bitcoin would then just become an investment platform for the rich, and anyone wanting to pay for things would have to use alt coins. I think you would find that the vast majority of people would then turn to the alt coin since it would have real day to day applications, where bitcoin did not, and it would be just as easy for them to hodl alt coins as bitcoins, devaluing bitcoin further.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:48:45

Coinbase have already posted that people should withdraw their bitcoins before a HF. They can't guarantee the coins in that situation since your private key will work on both chains, and their system is prepared for one chain at the moment.

Makes sense to me.
Unlike some people I've heard complaining, it doesn't bother me to pay $1 for a transaction fee, when I consider most of my transactions are over $100.
Obviously, if I were to have transactions for $10 with a $1 fee I might balk a bit ;)
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:43:55

I *think* coinbase allow sending to paypal.
Personally, I wouldn't exchange bitcoin for paypal, I'd get it transfered directly to my bank account. Too much risk of a charge back on paypal.
Alternately, you can use localbitcoins.com and exchange it in person for cash, or have the person transfer to your bank account, and yes, there's the option in some cases of payment to paypal there too, though I don't advise it.

In Europe, until it is converted to euros, it can't be considered for capital gains. So you can hold it in your wallet indefinately, even on the exchange, or spend it as bitcoin, and you won't have to pay taxes on it. That said, the moment you exchange it for fiat, you have to pay taxes on it.

I can live with bugs, they're an inevitability in software. But BU is not being properly reviewed, and there's a generally nonchalant attitude about it in rBtc. "oh it's just a bug, all software gets bugs". Yes, but if it was properly reviewed, you wouldn't have 2 MAJOR bugs in less than 2 months.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:44:08
yes, I did, though not sure what point you're trying to make regarding what Luke-Jr said.
What I take from it is that with the way it currently works, they can bring it back to cpu/gpu mining, but eventually, ASICs will be in force again.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:07:06
Why would it account for loss? If you bought bitcoin in 2010 and didn't sell them, you'd now have a large profit. The ups and downs of bitcoin don't really affect you if you hodl.

He's not evil, he's in it for himself.
If anyone here tells me that the decisions they've made regarding bitcoin are purely altruistic, I call bullshit.
Everyone here is in it for themselves: hodlers, transactioners, miners, devs.
Everyone here has money invested and want to see it grow. The only difference is ideologies. Right or wrong, that's all they are. Nobody is carrying out their ideologies to be assholes. They're carrying out their ideologies to see their money grow.
Bottom line is, everyone here is watching their wallet, and doesn't give a shit about your wallet. Nor should they.

I'm guessing you're in the USA, so you're thinking locally.
What about child support for all the other 200+ countries which may have a vastly different process? You'd be asking developers to add functionality to process all of this.
While we're at it, what about alimony? or bad debts for people who won't pay?
And once you implement those, I'm sure countries around the world would also want it to take care of taxes automatically, etc, etc.
As you can see, any implementation where you rely on the currency to fix a societal issue is extremely complicated and quite honestly, a massive can of worms.
This kind of thing should not be the responsibility of the blockchain to fix, it is the government's responsibility. If you don't feel they're doing a good job, contact your government representatives and complain to them.

I'd say anything above 3% is going to be a blocker for a large number of people.
I know it's comparing apples and oranges, but the reality is, the majority of mainstream are looking for a way of doing micro-payments etc, like they do now with payment processors.
most online processors I believe charge around 3-4% so if the tx fee is higher than that, why would mainstream adopt bitcoin?

"voting" right now is based on hash power. If all the hash power is concentrated on a few miners, they get all the votes.
Specifically, in the case of a hard fork, if the miner's put all their hash power to one side of the fork, the other side has no hash power to actually process transactions. So they can force you to choose a side of the fork, simply by putting all their hash power into it.

I never said I spent $100 specifically for this. I could've just gotten the $5 board, and a cheap 128GB micro SD, and just used the node in pruning mode.
I spent £37 on the Pi Zero because I wanted the kit, regardless of bitcoin. The hard drive was just one I had laying around, I may have spent £50 on it, but it was bought for an entirely different purpose.
You're overthinking this :)
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:59:18
Lol, so after this back and forth, I think we're actually in agreement.
Asic mining is bad for decentralisation, and satoshi was aware of the issue, but right now there's nothing we can do about it.
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:36:18
You can compile bitcoin core without a wallet, so yes.  But you either have to build a custom app that connects to nodes and downloads the wallet, or compile bitcoin core to do it. There isn't a central URL to download it from (hence decentralised).
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:52:06
I know this post is a few days old now, but I randomly ran across a post by Theymos that specifically states that neither he nor (he thinks) Satoshi anticipated ASIC mining. I'd say that pretty much invalidates your argument that they understood this was inevitable :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:45:30
here, have a look at this, the BU devs themselves think it was someone monitoring git. (and their hilarious solution, is to hide it better next time :D)
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:34:17
I suppose not if you don't mind paying absurd amount of transaction fees to miners who are already rich from mining.
I can accept that miners should still earn a profit from transaction fees in order to justify mining once the mining reward becomes too small, but it doesn't make sense to me to go above and beyond and give them high volumes of high transaction fees, when simply high volumes of reasonable transaction fees would bring them profit.

FUD much?
You need to learn about how markets work. A there's no such thing as a downward rate or upward rate. The markets fluctuate between the two.
We're still at 184% higher from same time last year.
Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down, it's just the way things are. Either hodl, or sell, no need to scare everyone just because you don't know how the market works.

For reference:
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:30:11
compile bitcoin core with --disable-wallet
when you run bitcoind it will download the blockchain.
you have to either use bitcoin core or build your own application based on bitcoin core to do it.
Part of what bitcoin core does is validate and verify the blockchain, so that's really the only way to download it and be certain everything is kosher.
There is no way to "just" download the blockchain afaik.

Note to self, don't invite abdada to any welcoming committee.
You're talking like people buying bitcoin are buying stocks. They're not, they're buying a currency, which they can use to buy things.
Do you really expect people to go read books on investment risk before going out and buying GBP or EURO, or any other currency?
Same thing applies, except BTC is more volatile, and people need to be calmly informed of that fact.

Fair play to you if you have that much invested that you're willing to throw away money.

so I just went to their website for the first time, and there's a quote on the main page that's confusing me:


Doesn't this auto-imply that the transaction fees will pay miners by volume, and not by simply increasing transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:37:22
I stand corrected then :)
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:50:44
Pi zero, with 512mb RAM can run 1MB blocksize, I would expect the Pi 3 should be able to handle 2MB, but I won't comment on higher.
Even for the 2MB I'm just guessing, since I haven't seen where the processing and memory usage goes.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:31:37
And now we're back to Anarchy :)
So, let's say that 1000 people have voted for 1 person to represent them.
Then of those 1000 people, 1 person has decided to withdraw consent, but the other 999 still want to give consent to the one representing them.
That person who withdrew consent, then has to step up and represent himself.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:51:52
Did they say why the transaction failed? Just asking because every story has 2 sides, and if you're trying to warn us away from them, it would be good to know the whole story...
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:12:52
Thanks for the replies guys, clarifies it nicely.
That said, I would have thought that processing transactions by order of creation would be the simplest method of proceeding, but then again, I'm not familiar enough with the actual transaction process to really offer an opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:04:07
I think there's too many people defaulting to the "have you read the whitepaper" line. 
We're inadvertently creating an elitist system whereby only the technically savvy or those who have read and understood the whitepaper have a right to comment on the future of bitcoin.
I'll reiterate the quote I already posted from the whitepaper:


This to me is clearly a means of performing instant transactions, regardless of quantity or size.
Using it as a means of savings is a perk, not a defining trait.

FUD much?
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government.
That means their mandate is for foreign threats. They have very limited ability to function in the USA.
That said, since I'm not in the USA, I am concerned about their reach. However, I'm not going to FUD to the point that I think they'll actually have any interest in going through my porn and comic book collections.
Seriously consider it, there's 7.4 Billion people in the world. Even excluding the USA's 325 million, do you really think they have the computing or manpower to search through everyone's electronic equipment, specifically to search for your private keys? That may or may not have 0.2 bitcoin...seriously?
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:50:37
Is financial privacy for transactions of 0.1 really that necessary?
I could understand it if we were talking about amounts &gt;1 BTC, but for $100, it's hardly worth the paranoia.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:40:29
and you are fixating on exactly the same thing.
Shouldn't you be more concerned that the bug existed at all due to poor reviewing, rather than that a tweet highlighted it?
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:30:29
Not implying that at all, I honestly have no idea how many people have sold off their bitcoins for fiat.
I'm just trying to clarify for everyone that if you don't convert to fiat, you don't have to declare anything.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:31:55
yep, my point is that they were more concerned about Peter Todd communicating it on twitter, than they were about the existence of the bug itself.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:19:35
Personally, I'm against transaction fees altogether. Miners already get payment from mining. Transaction fees are just there to enrich their pockets, prioritisation of transaction could be achieved another way, though I'd argue that there shouldn't be prioritisation at all, transactions should simply be processed on a first come first served basis.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:17:51
Clarify?  Bitcoin is not classified as a currency and it has no inherent value, so in the eyes of the government, it is worthless, so how do you pay capital gains on something with no value?

I never mentioned a quote by Satoshi... I specifically said that Theymos thought that Satoshi felt the same way:


Also, it should be noted, that while there is no quote from Satoshi saying so, there is also no quote saying differently.
So in the end, we're both just assuming, the difference being, that regardless of his age or inexperience, Theymos actually did work with Satoshi, and was better placed to make assumptions of what satoshi thought, where neither of us did.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:56:47

You're right, people shouldn't invest more than they can afford.
That said, it's not your call, and it doesn't give you the right to tell people that they're poor candidates for bitcoin.
Hell, I bought in at over 1000 (euro), and got spooked the first time it took a major dip, but saw plenty of people posting that it was normal, and after a bit more research, decided to just relax and ride it out.
Trust a little that if you explain it to people, they will do the right thing.
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:03:42
So you're saying bitcoin is only for the elite? Only for those of us who have money to invest in it? In that case, you're feeding into the case for the naysayers who tell us that bitcoin has no practical use, and that you can't use them to buy or sell anything.
Bitcoin will then once again be worse than gold, since with gold, you can in theory at least make things out of it, and bitcoin's only purpose would be for potential savings (until people figured out that it really has no relative value, since you can't do anything with it).
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:30:18
yep, unhinged sounds about right. They're so focused on how "we're attacking them" and Peter Todd's tweet, that they're completely ignoring the reviewing issue inherent to BU which led to the bug being out in the wild in the first place.

Imagine if they have thousands of clients trying to do swift payments, should they courier checks for all of them? Most businesses don't even use cheques anymore anyway.
And lastly, they have clients all over the world, should they open an exception just for you, and send you a check just because you live nearby?  To me it sounds like it's just a technical glitch which will probably be resolved soon.

How? The devs were obviously aware of it, you said yourself they had already merged the fix before he commented on twitter.
Responsible disclosure means you tell the development team you found a bug. In this case, all he did was comment on a bug the development team had found themselves.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:53:19
got notification of your reply, which you either deleted or got censored for some of the words you were using.
basically, as you said, it's possibly a scam.
so, 2 scenarios:
1) scam - so basically all the wallets on their site are theirs, so they simply transfered all bitcoins from all wallets into their personal wallet. Coins lost.
2) legit - it's a tumbler, so it has to move the coins around a bunch of different random wallets before sending back to you. I presume part of this may be a manual process, so could theoretically take time to send them to the wallet you specified.
Most likely it's no. 1 though.

I did actually, here's a quote for you:

Seems to me, Satoshi always intended bitcoin to be a transactionable currency, not just a savings platform.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:57:13
But hard to confirm all that without dialogue. Without dialogue all we have are assumptions of their intentions.

I doubt it'll become a real threat, as someone else said, miners will be bouncing back and forth for a while and difficulty in both coins will adjust accordingly.
And why would it need to be done urgently? This isn't something that would happen overnight.
As for a more precise answer on how long it would take, you'd need to talk to a bitcoin developer.

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:52
While I don't subscribe to 's clear trolling, I disagree with you.  Fees are definately an issue, and it's an issue that needs discussion. To ignore the fact that fees are high just gives more ammo for the bch crowd to put down btc as a flawed coin.
Whether we like it or not, people need to be able to create transactions, and not everyone is willing to wait multiple hours for a transfer, if it goes through at all.
Don't get me wrong, I agree with a fee market, and I agree that if I want a transaction to go through quickly, I need to be willing to pay more than the next guy, but at the moment, the backlog of transactions is hyperinflating the fees, and that is an issue.

Bitcoin is a currency. 
Did people stop using dollars just because they're used to pay for sex-trafficking, drugs, or anything else? No.

Not to rain on your parade, but  already does this, and includes importing data from popular exchanges...
For what it's worth, I ran into the same issue, and when asked, people just told me to use excel.
I ended up building 2 versions in PHP.
One where I manually import/hardcode the cash I spent.
Another that gets the historic price at the time the wallet received bitcoins.
Downside to the latter is if you use intermediate wallets (ie. buy on kraken, then only transfer to your main wallet some time later - at which point the price may have changed and that's the price at which it would display).
The workaround to the intermediate wallet is to include it in the API calls, but since most online services reassign wallet addresses to prevent reuse, that could be complicated too.
So, to answer your questions.
Ability to enter purchases and sales and specific dates, and be able to retrieve historic prices (as mentioned).
Also the ability to import transactions directly from an address
Ability to import csv of transactions from an exchange.
Don't limit it to ios or android. Some of the current portfolio trackers I saw were nice, but were limited to those platforms.
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:53:28
Segwit has always been intended as a stopgap, it'll allow sidechain transactions, and it opens the door for further improvements.
Just doing a block increase just harms node providers, so in my opinion is off the table.
Extension Blocks are certainly a possibility, but why would I go with a solution drafted by some random developer over a 24hour caffeine binge over a solution that has been in planning for ages by the vastly more experience core team?
That sole developer that wrote the paper on extension blocks did not have any time to proof his work, or consider all the scenarios in that period.
The core team has spent a considerable amount of time and effort coming up with the segwit solution.

Is there some place we can see how much more miner support we need?
Or is this something you know off the top of your head?
Is it just Bitmain actively blocking us? If so, maybe we can focus on convincing all the other miner's standing on the sidelines - would that be sufficient to push it over the line?
We're all so focused on bitmain, we tend to forget all the other miners who, together, could push this accross.

What illegal activities?
Unless you have some inside info nobody else has, you're blowing smoke.
The only issue mentioned so far has been site unavailability causing losses.
In other words, people couldn't access the website due to lag or site crashes, in other words, technical issues.
Do you plan to sue your ISP every time you get lag?
And yes, millions trade online, and they also suffer from technical issues on occasion.
Here its simply more visible because it's a concentrated community. There are thousands of trading websites etc for Fiat currencys and stocks. The issues they have aren't as visible because the entire "trading" community isn't focused in one or two subreddits like the bitcoin community is.
You can't just sue a website because of technical issues.

So, in your mind, the people who have invested millions upon millions in bitcoin don't matter, as long as the miners are happy, because they're the ones who matter?

most wallets allow you to add a note to a transaction, so yes.

So, let me do the math.
Right now, I could afford an S9, but the electricity costs would mean I'd probably be losing money.
But let's assume that I could do it with free electricity like they do in China.
Can we guess at how many years it would be before I could match bitmain (considering he's also making money and improving his mining operation continuously)?
Let's at least be realistic, some random joe getting into mining at this stage doesn't have a hope in hell of having his "voice" heard.

So, what you're saying, is that I should go out and spend my money to upgrade my node, which I get no monetary benefit from, so that you can save on your transactions with a block size increase, when segwit would've done the same thing without me having to spend any money...does that about cover it?
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:19:28
you can also move the pool of "normal" addresses into a separate account, and only check the account with "imported" addresses.
So, you can use getaddressesbyaccount to get the imported addresses, and then use getreceivedbyaddress to filter out the ones that have been used.

I'm curious what will happen when the BU community decide they want an improvement that bitmain is against, and he puts all his hashing power against it.
Sure will suck to have centralised mining then won't it.


get real, he has millions invested in his mining farms...Unless someone else with millions to throw around decides to build a mining farm, that's wishful thinking at best.
Even contacting chinese manufacturers to start building new Asics is a significant investment with no guarantee that bitmain wouldn't simply throw more money at the problem and simply build more mining operations, making your investment useless.
In any event, your average joe doesn't have the technical knowledge to have a clue on how to engineer one.

You realise that a pure blocksize increase would eliminate half the nodes out there right?
A lot of nodes are running on raspberry pis and old computers. And even if they are running on modern computers or servers, a pure blocksize increase would exponentially increase storage and bandwidth requirements for any node.

Quite honestly, no, at that point, bitcoin would be no different from fiat currency, so I'd just cash out, and toss my money back in the bank.
Having a global currency controlled by a single entity, regardless of what it is, means that your use would be controlled by them.
Bitcoin has the potential for freedom. But at the same time, because it is digital and managed by software, it also has the potential for complete control if someone dominates the hashrate.
At the very least, with Fiat, in that situation, you could always just use cold, hard cash, and limit their control that way.

To be honest, I don't understand the concensus rules.
I personally feel, the easiest way would simply be to release Segwit.
Miners that support Segwit simply start mining under Segwit.
Those who don't will end up with their altcoin like they wanted.
I know I'm essentially describing a hard fork, but, lets face it, at this stage, is a hard fork really any worse than the division and stalemate that's already happening?
If we're waiting for BU supporters to suddenly see the light and start signalling segwit, I can pretty much guarantee they wont.

Generally speaking, all you need to do is display a bitcoin address to receive a payment.
Assuming you want more than donations (ie. an actual shopping type system):
Generate a new address per purchase (best practice).
Connect either to a bitcoin node, or one of the common APIs (blockchain for example) to confirm if the payment was received.

Tell me where in any of my posts did I say anything about forcing anyone to update software.
I was going to leave it at that, but I'm tired of the "have you read the whitepaper?" question.
I have.
To be clear, people **do not** have to read the whitepaper to discuss bitcoin.
People need to get their head out of their asses and stop this elitist attitude of thinking that only the ones who have read a damn document can possibly have a grasp of what bitcoin is.
Anyone who has invested their hard earned money into bitcoin has every right to discuss bitcoin, regardless of whether they've read the whitepaper or not, and it's not for you, or anyone else to say otherwise.

Price would probably drop temporarily, but other than that, nothing.
People would continue to use the dark web, and bitcoin. The only difference is US based shops and websites that accept bitcoin would no longer be able to publicly say so.
They can't ban the dark web or bitcoin. Regardless of any laws they create.
How do you ban the dark web? (don't you think they wanted to after the silk road?)
How do you ban bitcoin?
I currently have bitcoin in my wallet.
What's my wallet? It's a private key and a public key.
They don't even have the means of taking my bitcoins, much less banning me from sending bitcoins to someone.
Like I said, the only way to ban bitcoins and the dark web, is to take down the internet.

Can even run it with a Raspberry Pi Zero ($10).
If you use a node as a wallet, you're ensuring your transactions adhere to the consensus rules without having to rely on other people's nodes.
By running a full node, you're sharing the blockchain with other people so the can do the same.
By running a pruned node, you're expanding the Bitcoin network.
All in all, all pluses.

To be fair, in the context of when Satoshi wrote that, he considered that every node was a miner (mining was built into the client at the time). But even then, he considered that eventually there would be specialised mining facilities, and eventually Asic mining.
The main problem I see with fees, is that, as envisioned by Satoshi, fees could exist to speed up processing, but he always thought that even without fees, transactions would eventually be processed. As we can see now, that isn't the case. If you run a transaction without fees now, it'll simply be returned to you in 72 hours, because all of the miners now have a minimum acceptance fee, and simply won't process anything else.

**IF** all you have are imported watch-only addresses, you could pull the list of all addresses, and then check them against getreceivedbyaddress.
However, from other posts, I **think** you mentioned you'd be storing the addresses in a database at some stage.
If that's the case you could also simply flag them there as used.
**these are all workarounds until pull request is merged**

so, what would happen if a new release came out that activated it immediately (considering 99% of nodes can already interact), rather than waiting for 95% signalling?
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:07:58
Following on from my comment below, what I would do is:
Use a separate php file in conjunction with curl to connect either to the node via rpc or to an api via rest.
Call that file via js or jquery on a timer until the transaction is complete.
Assuming that you're generating a new address everytime, you can simply check getreceivedbyaddress with minimum confirmations.
Once you've confirmed the amount received, you accept the transaction as complete
getreceivedbyaddress is the bitcoind rpc method, similar methods exist in most bitcoin apis but can vary in name.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:48:42
Wouldn't be surprised. People with bitcoin in their wallets are setting the price high for people with Fiat who are desperate to recover their money.

It already has a "stigma" from its use in the silk road and dark web in general.
There's nothing we can do about it, people will think what they want to think. There's no point worrying about it.

What I do need to know is that I can put my faith in Bitcoin. Having the future of Bitcoin dictated by a single mining company, who can choose to block any improvement the community decides upon, does not give me faith.
All that does is show me that Bitcoin is controlled by a central agency, much like fiat currencies are controlled by banks.

It's in situations like this that I agree with Hawaii's law that drove out coinbase.
Exchanges **should** have a reserve to draw on when things like this happens.
If they had a viable reserve of the equivalent of what's in their user's wallets, then they could now assume the risk for their clients, and sell bitcoins to their clients directly (even at a premium). People would be willing to accept some loss by paying for bitcoins at a premium rather than full loss by losing all their fiat.

Ok, so what sets the 95% activation requirement? How does each node "simply" know to activate? Is it not a setting put in by the core team? Are you saying the nodes just magically know when to activate?
That's what I'm saying, whichever setting is in place that tells nodes and miners to activate segwit at 95%, should be removed so activation happens immediately.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:42:54

That's a horrible analogy since it's hardware.
A better analogy would be if you purchased say ...a coin...and that coin is opensource, and supposed to be decentralized and managed by the community as a whole. But then you have a single person who decides that he doesn't like what the community wants, and doesn't let them do it, so everyone starts selling their coins and it loses all of its value.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:58:40
Where does that force people to update their software??
As far as I know, the core team isn't going to everyone's houses and putting a gun to their heads forcing them to update.
Hell, just look at statistics, we're at 0.14.0, but there's plenty of nodes still running 0.13 or less.
Asking core team to update the software so that when people update segwit will automatically be activated is not the same thing as forcing people to update their software.
Getting people to update software would have to be a community effort for those who support segwit, not the core team.
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:41:25


-- Satoshi
Well the above implies he knew there would eventually be miner centralisation.
I agree with you that times change. Bitcoin is a great thing, but lets face it, the whitepaper was written almost 10 years ago. Whether people like it or not, Satoshi wasn't all seeing and all knowing.
I know I'll probably catch some flak for this, but...
There is *nothing* wrong in changing the whitepaper, if the changes are agreed within the community, and are for the betterment of Bitcoin.
A lot of people have this concept that the whitepaper is like the bible, and can't change. I completely disagree with that. The whitepaper is based on technology, and technology changes.

I'm not sure I see the relevance to bitcoin...
If you're talking about market influence, then this should be in @_date: 2017-04-09 23:46:56
And for the record, I agree with the 95% consensus, but not when one mining company potentially controls 45% of the hashrate, and has significant influence over another large part of it, essentially giving him majority control of the hash rate. I'm sure you know this is called the 51% attack.
There's something completely flawed with a system where someone in the top 1% could come in and invest $1billion in a gigantic bitcoin mine, and completely take over control of everything.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:13:09


I agree with this part, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Bitmain is rich enough to control a vast amount of hashing power, and controls a large amount of Asic production, and can dictate if he agrees with proposals or not.
I'll revert to what I keep asking. What happens when the **entire** community decides on an improvement, and Bitmain decides against it?
It's easy to say for other people to mine to have their voices heard, but unless you have a few million lying around to invest in mining equipment, that's not going to happen, no common miner can hope to match their hashing power, and it'll continue to be Bitmain and associated mining pools that will dictate if improvements go ahead or not.

That's fair enough, and I don't claim to even pretend to understand all the ins and outs of what's necessary to get segwit accross the line.

@_date: 2017-04-10 01:26:11
my argument in this thread isn't about segwit or bu.
It's about mining centralisation.
Consider this, if bitcoin keeps climbing eventually someone with REALLY deep pockets will gain interest and they WILL build a giant mine and have overall majority.
I could easily imagine the US government doing something like that under the Treasury department.
Then it wouldn't be too far fetched for them to do something like hire a bunch of experienced developers to implement a change that would for example, record people's IP addresses in the transactions, or some other information. Then with their own hashing majority, they could push it through whether you like it or not.
That's what I'm arguing against, the possibility of mining centralisation which can affect the outcome of what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:10:06
I'd fully agree with you if we were talking about a de-centralised exchange like bitsquare.
But we're not. We're talking about an exchange that takes people's money for safe keeping, and people are expected to "trust" them to give it back.
We all saw how that worked well with Mt.Gox.
So sorry to disagree, but if a company chooses to run that business model, I'm fully in favour of men with guns forcing them to make sure my money is safe when I loan it to them.
As a compromise, I'd be fully willing to dispense with the above if:
1. Users were somehow able to keep control of their private keys.
2. The exchange were somehow able to guarantee users will always be able to recover the money in their wallets.

I agree completely, which is why our standard response to people like the op in this thread ( should be something along the lines of "Just wait for it to be implemented, it'll be seamless to you and you won't have to worry about that".
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:17:12
We're all assuming that a normal user/trader, will have a seamless experience in their wallet.
ie. the wallet will ask you if you want to put btc into a "hot wallet" or into a general wallet (very rough example).

Do you have any known cases? I've never heard of any...
Not really a good comparison with vaccines.
A better comparison would be online banking.
Following the instructions from those guides implies that anything you type on your computer while on the internet is likely to be intercepted.
Realistically, how many people have you heard of, that have had their bank account passwords stolen because they accessed online banking?
Yes, there is malware all over, but just use the same security principles you'd normally use to stay safe on the internet.
I do advise generating the keys offline, but once that's done, anything else is overkill.
Even if you were infected by malware, they're generally not copying everything that appears on your screen.  Even a keylogger would generally be useless since you're not typing in the keys, they're being generated.
Like I said, common sense should suffice.

have you checked your address independently (ie. check it in a block explorer?) if the bitcoins were in a wallet, regardless of whether it's an online wallet or not, they can't be moved out without appearing in the blockchain.
So you'll either see a transaction moving your bitcoins out of your wallet, or if there are no transactions, it may just be a website display issue (ie. your bitcoins are still there, but not displaying).

This is nothing new, you can manually generate transactions on any node.
You can even manually broadcast transactions on sites like blockchain.info

It's common sense, and common knowledge not to assume a transaction as valid until you have at least 3 confirmations.

Why wouldn't it be?
A house that today costs 200k USD isn't suddenly going to cost 1 bitcoin (at 3.8mil USD).
Keep in mind, that my initial estimate of 3.8mil USD is based on changing all fiat to bitcoin, it doesn't take into account additional fiat devaluation due to market fears, politics etc. So it's possible that each bitcoin could actually be worth a lot more.

I thought I captured the major ones that I'm seeing support for in both subs.
I didn't include reference to core or BU specifically, and I know I forgot 8mb blocks (though that was never on the table to include with segwit, so it should be included in the simple blocksize increase option).
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:03:13
It's the usual double standard from Bitmain can do no wrong.
Bitmain has a patent for covert Asicboost, implemented it on their hardware and has said they won't use it. They **must** be telling the truth.
Blockstream is always wrong.
Blockstream has patents which they've put under the DPL and confirmed with EFF that they will only use them defensively. Blockstream **must** be lying.
The amount of double standards, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and just blatant mud on the wall comments in is ridiculous.
The community's split might've been resolved at some stage through dialogue. Dialogue is not possible when is more interested in character defamation, lies, omissions, conspiracy theories, and double standards.
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:53:29
My feeling on this is that a lot of the criticism towards bitcoin core or segwit isn't based on actual facts but rather based on opinions:
"blockstream are core's bosses"
"core only want segwit because blockstream told them to"
"core is bad because they allow censorship"
etc, etc.
If you look at most of the posts are based on rumors and conjecture.  A large percentage of the opposition to core and segwit isn't even based on the merits of core or segwit, but rather because people are upset about the moderation/censorship in If you look at Roger's posts there, they're all inflaming posts, with very few actual facts.
If you look at any of Roger's videos online, most of them all revert back to the age old argument of moderation and censorship instead of arguing about the technical aspects of bitcoin.
So yeah, people here are hostile because we're tired of getting into arguments with people who use conjecture and name calling to prove their points.

Lots of people are already getting their salaries paid in bitcoin.
You can buy anything on amazon with bitcoin via purse.io and other websites. Japan just legalised Bitcoin as a currency and stores are starting to accept bitcoin directly. I wouldn't be too surprised if Japan allows paying taxes in bitcoin soon too.

Lol, you don't understand economy at all.
Right now, one gallon of milk costs around 0.001 BTC
So, if the OP has 1 Bitcoin, his store of value is the equivalent of 1000 gallons of milk.
If in 10 years, people are charging 0.00001 BTC per gallon, then the OP's store of value has increased and he can then buy 10000 gallons of milk with his 1 Bitcoin.
Feel free to replace milk with anything else, including fiat. Since that's the way currencies work.
If Bitcoin has the value people give it. And that value is assigned by how many bitcoins people will trade for something else.

I voted $2.
The logic for me is that I'm a Hodler, and all my bitcoin is in cold storage.
I run a node to help the network, not necessarily to verify my day to day transactions (which I use mycellium on my phone as a hot wallet and for transactions).
So to me, if I'm just running a node to help out, paying $2400/year is just not something I'm interested in.
At present, my node runs on a $10 Rpi Zero in pruned mode.
When it is no longer viable to run nodes on equipment such as that, I'll stop running the nodes.
Miners get paid for helping bitcoin (both in found bitcoins and transaction fees), noders do not.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:42:20
well, I could say, currently, a house costs 200k, and once bitcoin replaces fiat it would cost 0.00002 bitcoin, but people still have a tendency to think in terms of fiat, so I think it's adequate to use that to make a simpler comparison.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:50:54

You don't even need to go that far. I've run nodes at home at almost zero cost, why the hell should I go spend money to put a node in a datacenter with no return on my investment?
It's all well and good for miners who invest in hardware and become millionaires from the profits, not so much for nodes which are mostly run altruistically.

Interesting results so far:
206 votes total (keep in mind people could vote for more than 1 option).
71% in favour of Segwit in some form
29% in favour of only blocksize increase
Also interesting is that 60% are not willing to compromise, of which:
29% in favour of only blocksize increase
31% in favour of segwit (MASF or UASF)
Because people were able to vote on multiple options, the above information is the only information that can be safely affirmed as accurate.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:44:46
At this stage of the debate, regardless of the miners having a say or not, I'd be in favour of a 2MB non witness blocksize increase as a political compromise just to unite the community again.
What would be the risk here if we could get the majority of the community behind it? By majority, I mean that we'd probably be able to finally get everyone from the other camp behind a proposal like that.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:39:35
To be honest, it could be, but bitcoin has notoriety for money laundering, so the likely answer is that it's just stricter KYC/AML policies.
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:33:38
I think we're in full agreement.
My disappointment in the scaling debate is how those in the other forums are unable to accept segwit with a later blocksize increase.
Most here have said time and again that a blocksize increase will be necessary.
Most there have said time and again that they don't want segwit in any form.
That means that while our solution (segwit and later blocksize increase if needed), would be a small compromise on their part (mostly consisting of being patient), their solution (blocksize increase and no segwit) would be a huge compromise on our part, with all give and no take.

@_date: 2017-05-09 14:01:47
You think your dollars or pounds etc, cost nothing to create?
You need factories, trees, oil, inks, banks, etc etc to maintain a fiat economy.
In bitcoin you need miners and people with nodes running on old computers. And yes, electricity.
But the cost doesn't really compare.
As for usability, you have many sites accepting bitcoin.
People accept bitcoin in person on a daily basis.
And yes, there's people just speculating on the future.
Contrary to your belief, currency is not just to pay off debts to your government.
Barter existed before governments, and currencies are nothing more than a token for barter.
When you trade that token to someone, they know it has value, and can trade it on to someone else for things they want.
Eventually, someone decides that 1 token for 1 potato isn't a fair trade, so they want 2 potatoes for that same token. So now that token is worth more.
That's what gives currency value and that's how currencies work.

Doesn't matter.
I can use products from my day job on my projects because they are good products.
Just like the core devs can use products from blockstream because they are good products.
What you're saying is that if I worked for (name some company that creates software for linux), I couldn't contribute to linux open source because of some imaginary conflict of interest.
You guys could gain a lot more ground if you simply stated the technical aspects of segwit and LN you don't like, rather than trying to attack the character of the core devs.

@_date: 2017-05-17 18:44:34
I don't see why it shouldn't, I'm in favour of a blocksize increase after segwit if it's still needed.
Unfortunately, those in the other camp don't want segwit in any way, shape or form.
They're the ones offering a binary option: blocksize increase or nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:51:52
I'm not going to go back through all the threads I've posted, but I can tell you that I've seen numerous replies to posts I've made on suggesting what the OP is suggesting, where the replies were that people didn't want segwit in any form.
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:04:52
Actually, you're wrong. Blockchain.info has a hot wallet and you generate addresses on their wallet site, so yes, they have private keys.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:11:27
ok, so who should compromise?
If you go to they'll tell you they only want bigger blocks with HF, and won't even consider segwit.
Here, everyone wants segwit, with possibly bigger blocks after segwit is implemented.
Now, from my point of view, although it would take longer for the bigger blocks, they'd still get it in the end, if we implemented segwit now.  If we go with their solution, we'll get bigger blocks now, and never get segwit.
Does that seem like a fair compromise? To me it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:47:23
ah ok, I understand now.
No, it's not foolish to stop at $1.9 mil. It's up to each person to decide how much they want to hodl. If you're happy with 0.5 BTC, then that's entirely up to you.
That said, if you already have bitcoin, and eventually bitcoin replaces fiat, you'll probably end up with more bitcoin anyway.

I generally disagree with any improvements that could potentially put Bitcoin into a "bracket"
Bitcoin, in my opinion, is money. Simple as that.
It can't solely cater for hodlers, or investors, or shops, or coffee drinkers.
It needs to be able to function properly across the board.
Any optimisation for a single use-case, needs to take into account all other use-cases.
Also, regarding your post, I'll point this out nicely, though I'm sure others will come in from other forums not as nicely:
It "appears" you're looking for a niche to start charging an extra fee somehow.
If that is true, I'm vehemently opposed to it. If it's not true, you may want to reword it and pretty much remove anything that mentions fees.

Personally, I'd favour doing segwit + 2mb as a political (not technical) compromise, if we can get full consensus from both sides.
At this stage of the debate, if we have a chance to unite the community, I'd be in favour of it.
My concern here is that a lot of people in the other camp have voice their opinion that they don't want segwit in any way, shape or form. Their opinion is to simply raise the blocksize without segwit. That I won't agree with.
The main benefit I see in a segwit + 2mb compromise would be:
A united community

Sort of, it's a legal payment method, but there is no mandate that it must be accepted as payment.

@_date: 2017-05-02 11:40:33
Let's separate the argument a bit:
Blockstream does not have, nor can they patent anything on bitcoin itself.
As for their own technological advancements, they are a company, and they've spent money on it. Even if they are allowing everyone to use it, free of charge, it's a good idea for them to patent it before some random patent troll comes along and takes the patent and then charges everyone for it. So not only would Blockstream have paid for the work, they'd have to pay to use their own work. So yes, to me it makes sense.
That said, people have been mentioning 2 patents, and I'm not sure if they apply directly to segwit or not, so I can't comment on what they apply to.
As a last caveat, part of the reason Bitmain was so upset and which they documented in their blog post, is that they have a patent on their covert Asicboost and wouldn't accept any patch to disable it, since they would lose money on their patent.
Why isn't everyone screaming as much about Bitmain as Blockstream?

Yep, a lot of governments are cracking down on money laundering so these businesses have tightened their KYC/AML policies.
Might be better if you go ahead and pay in bitcoin since it's possible they'll retain your money for suspicion of money laundering.

Just handing over a wallet is probably going to make it far more traceable directly to you, than transfering it through any other method.
Let's say you have a paper wallet, where you bought bitcoins and put them into that wallet.  There's now a paper trail of money from your bank to that wallet.
You hand over the wallet, and that person does something nefarious with them. That money will lead directly to you, it won't even lead to the other guy, it would lead to you.
Your best bet is to go to a bitcoin atm and buy bitcoins with cash, and then hand them over.

Why multiple transactions and bank accounts? Is this for security or for taxation purposes?
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:21:24
A patent is not covert, but the feature is.
Overt Asicboost, is measurable, Covert Asicboost, is not.
The fact that you haven't read up on what you're criticising doesn't make me biased. It just makes you wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:23:57
Plenty of racism in the world to speak out against.
Questioning statistics is just ridiculous, not to mention that your original question had nothing to do with scamming. 
You were replying to the OP, which was just asking if anyone knew why Google queries for blockchain were on the rise in Nigeria.
You just assumed that if we're questioning anything about an African country we're all racists.
Grow up.
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:27:16
Ok, let's back up. Are you in favor of segwit or not? 
If you're not, then you have nothing to worry about right? Everyone against segwit keeps saying that it won't be activated, so it's a non-issue right?
If you are in favor of segwit, then what's the issue? You support the core team, and so far they've shown no evidence of malfeasance, and have clearly stated in writing that anyone can use their patents.
So again, how is this an issue?
And again, same caveat: If you don't trust what blockstream are saying they will do, how is it you trust bitmain saying they didn't use and didn't intend to use asicboost? 
Disregarding whether one is limited to hardware or not, it seems like a double standard to me.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:25:54
Lol, at this rate you guys must think everyone in works for Blockstream.
who do I talk to in HR to sort out my paychecks?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:23:30
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:57:57
I don't necessarily disagree, but he's at least he's trying.
At this stage, someone holding out an olive branch isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Who knows, it may actually do some good, and a few (not many), may come to the realisation that core is not what they've been led to believe.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:06:20
fair enough
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:07:22
Looks great!
How can I change currency from USD to EUR?
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:28:55
Ah ok, makes sense now.
You're just an asshole :)
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:21:03
Yes, it is actually.
There are some core devs who work for blockstream as their **day jobs** and then work on bitcoin in their spare time.
Neither jobs are mutually exclusive, nor does one job imply any malfeasance on their part when working on the other.
I can have my day job, and work on private projects on my own time. That doesn't mean the company I work for is funding my private projects. Nor does it imply any conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:06:37
Lol, that is hilarious.
It also proves my point.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:13:33
From the comments, their plan is to get a miner to get the first block, then the miner would be the one to spend their own money to incentivise someone for the following block, since otherwise those bitcoins would be useless. So on, so forth.
Doubt it'll happen, it's troubling that they'd go so low...
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:44:35
The very name should tell you why UASF isn't banned.
"User Activated" - as in, must have consensus of the users.
And in any event, the UASF is a soft fork for segwit, so still applies as segwit has consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:22:21
well, feel free to vote in the poll then :)
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:10:46
Great, that's your opinion.
So what's your proposal to resolve the issue?
(ps. pretty sure that core have repeatedly stated that they do have plans for bigger blocks **after** segwit)
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:47:46
Well, we were having a nice discussion about trying to include a 2MB non witness blocksize increase, and you had to ruin the discussion with your hostility...
Why is it so damn hard for people to have a technical discussion without having to worry about someone coming in and becoming hostile??
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:01:48
To be fair, the pull request has comments both for and against.
Also, unless I'm mistaken, I think some of the comments against aren't even from devs.
Here's an example of another comment that was in favor but did not want to risk core pushing it themselves:




@_date: 2017-07-26 14:54:59
yep, just bored with hearing r/btc saying how we **have** to stick to the whitepaper etc...
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:55:34
That's not likely to happen. 
Nor do I see why it should?
Why not have the miners change their attitude?
Your proposed solution is simply to let the stalemate continue then?
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:17:32
Excited and maybe a bit anxious.
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:59:21
For what it's worth, I'm in almost entirely the same boat.
Have just over 2 BTC.
I won't risk margin trading or arbitrage because really, it's just gambling.
As a web developer, I do have a skillset that occasionally allows me to supplement my bitcoins with odd jobs/minor projects that pay in btc.
Depending on your skillset, you may try that as well, I've seen jobs on that range from programming to sales and everything in between.
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:18:41
That's great, so what's your proposal for a solution?
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:43:52
Because we're discussing a feature that will go into bitcoin, we're not promoting the altcoin itself.


The discussion isn't about Litecoin itself, it's about segwit being activated on litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:06:07
no worries, just didn't understand the first comment, much clearer now :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:02:27
I'm pro segwit, things haven't gone badly for me at all. I'm just tired of all the hate and insults...
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:59:39
the option I put in is for separate blocksize increase.
We all know and it has been commented ad-nauseum that segwit includes a blocksize increase.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:35:50
so, you'd prefer to have 1.9 million instead of 3.8? 
To each his own I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:58:55
Half of those are non issues for a common user.
Most users don't need to be hyper paranoid and print out paper wallets in non connected computers, with non connected printers, then store the wallet in a vault, then put that vault in a bank, then throw the bank into a deep hole, etc..
Generally speaking, just used the downloaded version of bitaddress.org. If it makes you feel better, generate the address with wifi turned off.
Print it out, done.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:48:48
That works too :D
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:51:28
I don't understand the logic behind blocks smaller than 1MB.
Wouldn't that reduce the amount of transactions being processed?
Or is the plan to increase the frequency from 10 minutes?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:38:27
You may want to look into the legality of this. I'm pretty sure the EU has laws regarding private information of users.
I seem to recall a case a few years ago in France where some guy won a case against google to have all his personal data (ie. any mention of him) permanently erased from google.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:55:25
Segwit + LN would solve that without need for a HF
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:57:46
Thanks for the reply.
Also, is there any problem in simply leaving them (I understand it would mean losing the value of the off chain coins - which likely wouldn't be worth much anyway).
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:52:42
Since RFID chips don't have the ability to generate new addresses, doesn't this mean he's re-using the same address over and over again?
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:00:14
already said they replied so this is moot point.
That said, your logic is baffling.
You're basically saying that if I were to make a post on the front page saying "Aliens exist" and Nasa didn't reply to refute it, then it must be true.
Lack of response is not evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:56:05
Some people are already paid in bitcoin. It makes sense if they want to buy coffee and pay for groceries with bitcoin instead of having to convert it to fiat first.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:25:53
you're the one who mentioned 10% of the transaction as an argument.
And as for the past, that's your business, not mine. I was just responding to the single transaction you mentioned.
Fwiw I was doing bitcoin transactions when there weren't any fees. Now I have to pay large fees to get my transactions across. Do I like it? Hell no, but I do what is required by the market until such a time as Segwit + LN activates.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:11:39
At 40 satoshi/byte for that $200 transaction, you paid less than 0.5% for that transaction.
Even if you went up to 200 satoshi/byte, you'd have paid less than 3% for the entire transaction and would have that transaction processed in a few hours. That's a lower fee than pretty much any other payment method other than cash in person.
I'm not saying that's a good thing, we all want lower transaction fees, but you really have nothing to complain about if you're trying to be stingy when the current market requires "a little bit" more.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:48:35
Pretty sure all those need software updates for segwit. Not sure about chain split double spending though...
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:16:50
thanks :)
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:08:39
This is Reddit, they don't need to respond at all.
And I'm not saying it's not true, I'm saying there isn't enough proof of it being true or false in either case.
Lack of response by CB on a Reddit forum is not evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:01:20
Thanks for the responses :)
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:48:29
Ah, if it's on reddit then it must be true.
Do your own due diligence, don't just rely on what people post.
What you're referring to was posted with a throw away account, so there's no way to know if the person was telling the truth, just a troll, or competition trying to drive users away from CB.
Coinbase definately has issues, but don't rely on what information you can get from Reddit as your only source for a decision.
