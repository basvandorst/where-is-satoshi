Sorry, I need to hear their side of the story too. I find it rather hard to believe they would "ban" you from using them.
On the other hand, I am sure they are locking you for the reason they are making sure you did not take your "cut" before you reported the issue. If this is the case, the communication on their part is bad of course, then again I can understand how they want to look into your account first.

Sad thing is with some people here:
Dude could be standing right in front of some people here and they still would scream "SHOPPED!!!!"
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:09:13
Ebay, Facebook, Apple..... starting to see a pattern here.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:10:00
If I was an exchange, places like NY and CA would be on the very bottom of my list.
When they start telling me my soda is too big... screw you.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:25:38
Investigating is one thing, making stuff up is another.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:12:35
I read:
"We want to regulate and tax it to death.".
That is what I read.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:23:16
Well, because the way the FIAT is right now, things might get ugly really fast. Rather have some kind of other established type system in place.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:34:35
Media and the government are hand in hand. They hate not having "control". Doing this as a scare tactic.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:15:51
Heck, he could get a job in Vegas. Charge a good price to marry people or something lol.

Yes, but a terd is still a turd no matter how much you polish it lutz
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:13:53
Good or not, fake or real, I am not going to judge, but... I will say this... its WoW....
I bet most of these people who dont think highly of BTC, are the very same ones who mine gold in there and sell for profits lulz
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:45:56
The only hold up for me is either the funds getting into the bank. Thats all on the bank not bitcoin.
If I want instant I can go to local bitcoins and sell them there for a WU or something.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:01:38
I am shocked... shocked I tell you!
I did not for one minute think this guy was the guy, sadly, we have a world full of gullible people.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:23:06
People who are really worried should put a freeze on the credit. This will prevent ANYONE from doing anything with it... they can pretend to be you, but what good is it when they cant gain anything out of it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:40:01
Yep, and dont like it welll.... too bad . They know they go ya.
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:38:26
Sadly many people already think its a ponzi, used only for illegal activities... anything bad.
Its a uphill battle. The media **IS NOT** on our side.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:01:20
That pic was so train pron for us train lovers ( yes n-scale myself )
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:48:01
I really and starting to wonder if credit unions are the way to go for something like this. I love credit unions to begin with... many reason and too many to list, and this seems to be yet ANOTHER thing to add in their column. I have not heard of many people having issues with CU and BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:51:12
Im sorry people lost money yes, on the other hand when I jumped in a year or so ago, I did some research. Gox would have been the very last place I would have risked my money or BTC in. Plenty online for those that took the time to look and do some digging.
BTW, this is the internets, everyone is dicks on it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:05:30
You need to educate yourself on what you call real... which I assume you are talking about paper money.
Understand the basics about FIAT, then come back. I can promise you will have another outlook.
Then again, you just rather spread fud around. Much easier to be a parrot than it is learning something.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:05:07
I dont think it would be good. It would scare away a lot of big players .. that is my 2 cents, and getting worth less by the minute it looks like.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:45:36
Keep talking like a  2 year old and people are not going to take Doge seriously.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:38:16
Strokes do that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:14:58
Okay lets say he is found. THEN WHAT? The coins are STILL there. STILL can be dumped. Knowing who it is is not going to change one damn thing.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:23:34
If this is true those people who used it are no better than the frapicino lover that ran gox. Heck, I might put them a rung under him.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:43:49
Why would they? Plus, if peoples BTC in there are clean BTC, they more or less stole money from people all over the world for no reason at all. We are not talking about chump change here.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:36:35
I hope she learns a valuable lesson.
1- Never ever pisses us geeks off
2- Be more careful when running a story. Especially this big... 
3- Have more solid facts to back up your story then one line... which that in itself was questionable.
4- Dont gox some innocent person like she did.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:40:40
Well, some were calling for regulation... here is some of it. Enjoy. Too bad you f'ed it up for everyone one now.

Yeah I was taught in keyboarding class ( yes we had that for computers back when I was in school ) to use double spaces when writing. I dont do that much anymore trolling online but for something official I would.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:19:36
A tip for you
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:59:41
BUT ITS TRUE!!!! ITS FROM THE MEDIA!
This reminds me of the Dewy beats Truman instance in reporter History.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:05:42
LUtz at the Buffet circle jerk in here.
Look, I might take his advice when he pays every last penny in back taxes.
I also chalk this up to listening to the trolls in exchange troll box. Never your best intentions in mind. I feel he would be interested in this if he had money in it. 
This guy would also be more than happy to support and kind of bending over the feds would do to any of us if that ment he could make a buck off it, which he probably would because he more or less is hand in hand with big government.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:11:52
Agreed.... might even make this one of the last publications from a bad company.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:35:18
Honestly, running to the media will damage BTC more than you can imagine. You should know the media loves them the scandals.
IMO, if the stuff dude has is really that big of a deal, he needs to shit or get off the pot. Simple as that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:02:44
Yet no one has hacked it for years then? Come on.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:44:12
SO much wrong with what you said, all the effort I will put into this is saying your a tool.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:21:29
Yes this is a must with anyone that is thinking about being serious in BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:48:59
Yeah and this is why I am so confused . As I said there was nothing in the lines of like when gox fell to explain this sudden and quick sell off, only to see it rebound 40 dollars in 15 minutes, and there was a ton of huge buys in that mix too... over 3700 BTC traded hands like 30 minutes ago.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:36:13
ZOMG! MY 150 BTC ARE GONE HOOOWWWWW!!!!????
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:23:18
If they had pulled it that would have made news concidering it was the big come back
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:26:54
And if they are legitimate? What about the user/s then with those coins you put on hold?
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:59:41
Yep that pretty much sums it up to the media and the normal folk who still think the news networks actually report news nowadays.
The other one is the BTC CEO committed suicide not long ago... sad story , but they thought she was the CEO of BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:21:58
Let alone anyone else over the years.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:45:38
I rather have it on state level than a federal one. More localized control then.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:27:09
Yeah sure so did I. Simple answer... and who knows if that was not fabricated by the reporter. Seeing how great her ethics are just by this story, I would not put it past her to make random shit up to fill in the holes.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:00:19
I hate paypal. Really really hate it. They froze my account for months for suspicious activity while they "investigated" all my sales...They also held the money too. The only thing that was suspicious about the whole thing is that I sold close to 700 dollars worth of items in a week... I needed the money due to issues at home, so they more or less put me in a even worse position too doing that. They really fucked me then. I did get my money back , but that is way besides the point.
Another issue is there is only ebay which only takes paypal. They have the market cornered. What other options are there? None and they know it. So pretty much if you want to participate in online auctions you have to use them. Monopolies work out so well now dont they? /s
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:32
Yes, but the public IS THAT STUPID and will believe this. That is why many people think bitcoin is bankrupt....after gox.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:41:54
We dont need to know who it is bottom line.
If he was going to cash out he would have been making some money already. Plus, if you are investing to make a living day trading I think you more or less doing it wrong. That is not what Bitcoin is about.
This is his/hers baby. No way in hell would they do anything to ruin it. 
There is so many reasons on why this person took a step back and let it grow on its own. Too many to list.
We dont **HAVE ANY RIGHT** to know who this person is. If this person decides to come out, it should be on their terms, **NOT OURS**!
One more thing, if this does take a good hold in the world economy ( which I really think it will ), I do hope that they do come forward down the road. This person would deserve the Noble for this. That again, is up to that person.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:53:32
Sometimes people do strange things when put into a unpleasant situation.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:56:56
Yep, over inflated price for crap.
Then again people would line up to buy a flaming brown bag full of poo if it had an Apple logo on it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:22:29
I know people lost money, a lot of money, but this just has to die, the sooner the better.
This is nothing but dead weight on BTC as a whole, these are the headlines for the news, how healthy does that make BTC look? Its going to take longer to recover/gain trust the more this crap drags on.
Gotta wipe out hands clean of this. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:34:26
In a trailer? Yeah , that sure gives a great image.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:30:09
The problem is, once you give an inch, it slowly creeps into miles and miles worth. Name one thing that any government has dabbled in promising to only do "minimal" and it stayed that way.
No , instead they keep adding more and more power.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:11:13
Yep they dont care as long as it gets readers, truth or not.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:57:02
People can not even balance a check book... its going to take a long time I think. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:00:14
I agree. I know some say we deserve to know. We dont deserve shit.
Then they go on about knowing who owns all the bitcoins, again I say who cares. They are there no matter if we know who he is or not. It would not change a thing except open that person or persons up to harassment.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:13:32
Thats how it goes.
The AHCA should be a good sign of what is to come when they say "later".
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:05:31
Eh mixed on this.
We should know, on the other hand, publicly this will damage Bitcoins image even more. Bitcoin can only take so much at once, and really, with all the bad news from the media, from Gox to the "CEO of bitcoin" committing suicide ( yeah they forgot the exchange part no joke )...
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:49:16
That will show em .
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:36:16
Well said!

@_date: 2014-06-12 20:21:55
I dont think its a whale though to be honest. They dont seem to exist in the US.....
I guess the best case right now seeing all the activity is that China wakes up and sees tons of cheap BTC and responds with as much buying as we are seeing from selling on the US side.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:19:14
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:26:01
Sadly, that is never the case. Give an inch instead they take a mile.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:11:50
As happy as I would be too to get in at such cheap prices, it really hurts the advancement of the coin adaption. Think about this, your a retailer who accepts BTC, only to see the price bottom out in a few hours. Companies HATE that kind of uncertainty, more so when massive losses could be involved.
BTW I do think its the FBI, because there is so much volume coming from the US its not funny, usually this is China type volume, we never even come close to what they do in a day, for some reason the tables are turned today right now. See for yourself and watch on fiatleak 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:05:50
Paypal is the evil of this earth.
Sadly, people still swear by them, and only way to do ebay is with paypal.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:46:13
Yes that is why he would change.  You can go from being one of the smartest people to a blubbering idiot in a day. I dont know if that was what you were intending on saying, but it seems like you were questioning how he got that way.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:31:51
Props to the op for doing the right thing, much of which has gone to the way side now a days sadly, heck just look down the comments and you will see what I mean.
People want BTC to succeed yet think said issue should be exploited if that means making some quick money.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:02:30
It just cost SO MUCH MONEY... well depends on the scale yes... I would love to see that in z-scale now that would blow my mind.
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:46:46

@_date: 2014-03-14 14:46:46
Fck you Buffet. When you pay back the millions of back taxes then I might even think about starting to listen to the crap you gotta spew. Plus, you likes yourself some big government, they are your gravy train.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:53:06
Yet he used his real name on the white paper... pleeeeaaaazzzzz
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:49:01
If Bitcoin ever put my transaction on hold for 6 months while they "verified" everything, I would drop them too and tell them to suck a big dong like I did paypal.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:47:11
O dear I have been mocked to no end from people who usually support many things I do. This for whatever reason is the exception.
I think what it comes down to is people just dont understand the concept yet.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:09:44
He said she said. Unless there is audio/video proof it never happen. We dont know the context of the question ect ect.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:00:29
Most of the media does this. Sadly, that is why most people dont like/fear Bitcoin. They see it in the media and think its all true.
How do you think most of our elected officials stay in office?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:41:59
Its only a matter of time dude, only a matter of time. Just like everything, some make it the whole time without issues, that does not mean that others have not.
I think most of the problems occure from the big banks rather than credit unions. IMO, credit unions are the way to go for the big banks only care about the bottom line...not that cu's dont, but there is much more control/say for the common folk in credit unions.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:49:12
I too am satoshi...
See how easy that was?
Seeing how much integrity this lady has, who is to say she did not make that part up to with him saying he was part of it?

Hey you think for a minute if the real "Satoshi" wanted to be found he would have already done so?
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:43:51
Tax, make it hard to exchange to name a few
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:55:22
I know I was watching the BTC subject tweets and that CEO thing was hot for a good solid few days. Finally some realized how stupid they sounds ( after I tweeted with a correction of course )...they changed it but yeah... just like the whole newsweek thing and even the Gox thing "BTC went bankrupt!".
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:49:48
Now this guy, his family, his friends are now going to have their entire lives turned upside down. For what? Just because he has the same name as the so called creator of BTC.
What proof was there to expose this person...? In fact, what gives them the RIGHT to expose him like this?
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:36:31
You apparently have not had lots of people following you around, harassing you and you family, ect ect.

Lets not forget the editor is responsible too. They have the final say.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:42:28
Yeah I am confused him being a liberal and all. Usually liberals are about federal control lately... with Obamacare that is exactly what it is, where as BTC, is not centralized by no government.

@_date: 2014-03-19 00:43:55
Took the words right out of my mouth. I usually toss the whole tax thing back in his circle jerk supporters....shuts em up real good.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:47:20
Its just not them. Its the whole media pretty much, along with silk road.
In fact much of the population also thinks this, no thanks to the media.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:42:17
I guess if they dont want to implement it themselves, their loss. We kinda figured it would be only a matter of time before a 3rd party stepped up to do something like this.
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:05:58
I agree
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:12:28
It didnt even prove he admitted it in the first place.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:09:15
Yeah never mind someone with ill ideas thinking they could score millions by taking him hostage or threatening his family.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:19:48
Media does not care, only about the story now, no matter if its true or false, who ever gets hurt along the way.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:26:17
I see what you did there lutz!
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:06:07
Alot of the problem is the media will run negative stuff about BTC . They love em some bad news, any bad news.
First, I want to say what he is doing is bribery. If what he has is so damning, and he really "cares about bitcoin", it should be released to us anyways. Giving an ultimatum is nothing but bribing.
Second, going to the media and blabbing his/her mouth is nothing more than a call for attention. The media will love it, and it puts **US ALL UNDER BAD LIGHT**. Most people think we are bad and tie stuff like silk road and all of us. They think we only like Bitcoin for reasons like that.
Either shit or get off the pot. Running to the whore media is not going to help the image of bitcoin at all, in fact probably move it back another 6 months.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:10:04
Think you all missed the big picture here. 
Name one service fee your BTC wallet occurs?
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:16:26
To the MOON!
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:30:24
I do think the USD is very close to losing its status like we have now. Due to the idiots we call politicians. If that happens all hell will break loose... we will be a 4th world country .
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:04:21
In the us MEDIA you are guilty until proven innocent.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:59:30
Sure they will charge you 5% to transfer in, 3% to buy/sell, 3% to transfer out, but only 2% if you convert to USD via paypal
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:49:47
Yuck, but come on you know darn well its true that such things would happen with many apple fan people.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:04:28
Is this for realz? If it is, that is just sick and huge bump for BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:52:18
So pretty much fractional just like the FIAT then?
If that is right then well, these idiots want to do what they already have done and ruined the FIAT.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:25:07
Yep internet is forever.
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:41:34
Yet if they dont take them, they lose even more customers. I hardly carry cash on me anymore. I lost my wallet with 300 bucks in it cash, I can not get it back. I lose plastic, no money is gone ( unless of course it got stolen and used ) and I can get a replacement in less than a week.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:57:44
I have to disagree here. People over all are stupid. They still believe what the media says, no matter how many times they have been debunked.
Proof of this is the amount of tweets from normal people who keep saying "Bitcoin went bankrupt" after the whole Gox fiasco. This is what we as crypto supporters are fighting.
People also see the "silk road", Drug trafficking, everything BAD that has been done with cryptos, yet you find hardly anything positive.
Bottom line is we are fighting not only the governments, but bankers, and the media. All work hand in hand. Media has a big government tilt... as for bankers are hand in hand with big government. To those two, its the gravy train, and cryptos can disrupt that for it takes power away from them. They can not just print up my BTC...
Bottom line is, for every good thing that happens, you are going to hear 50x more bad stuff about it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:27:12
I mean I guess it "could" be done but it seems like a lot of hassle to do something like that.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:17:24
I bet this gets as much if not more attention than the real donation. Media would love this.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:41:04
Tell that to people who invested at 800 or 600.... just saying.
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:25:42
I am kinda active in political blogs. I lean conservative of course ( not that it matters it seems like this is blind to any political thinking ).... and I really do understand the resistance you get. It can be so overwhelming at time.
Pyramid scheme
Those 3 are the most common words used to describe BTC.
I had done a similar thing but not nearly as much as this person... think it was a few bucks, sent it to another person who was one of the very few supporters of BTC, ended up exlaining and showing how it all worked, how they could verify I sent yada yada yada... won a few people over.
IN the big picture I think this is due to 2 things:
People are scared of it, which is a result of:
People dont understand it because its something really new and complex.
I think once it begins to get mass adaption, there will be less resistance, mainly from those that dont understand. They are the ones that will be okay with it because it "just does".
Enough rambling, not sure I made any points hehe /shrugs
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:33:27
It also cost tons less to transfer money via BTC than WU.
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:47:48
Yes because people are too stupid and will pay dang close to retail for a used product. Plus Apple keeps the price artificially inflated with the buyback.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:29:51

You hit the nail on the head. They dont like something they cant manipulate and make more money off the backs of joes like me and you.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:55:17
I did some looking into exchanges before I jumped in. Simple google would have tossed up many flags with Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:15:35
Thats how stupid they are. They link the price on an exchange where the trading was froze and ignore that it was 300 dollars at the low point on other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:20:43
Gwad I hope not. They are part responsible for the mess we are in.
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:55:58
Yep and family and friends too. Why not, this hack did it without any solid proof.

I can blow smoke up anyones ass too. Saying =/= doing.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:02:53
Sadly, to many this would be it. People are not really "smart" enough about this whole mining thing.
Right now mining vs rate of return is so poor, you be a fool to pay over inflated prices for stuff.

With the right attitude, you can overcome many things in life. This is not a life ruining incident, if nothing else this will make you grow stronger and hopefully a much better person.
I really believe in Karma... when something bad happens, something good does too. Now it might not be now, tomorrow, or next week, but some day you will benefit in a direct or indirect way.
Keep your head up. Life is full of curve balls.
Edit: Money can be replaced, you can not be.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:51:04
Because all legal issues would then be on newsweek for such issues.

Because your not bankrolling them?

So.... you run a .exe from a file from hackers... and your **shocked** that it turned out to be a bad thing to do.
Look, if your that stupid to do something like that, considering the source, your just to dumb to use the internet then.

Yeah because you start to realize how stupid most people are.

The problem when it comes to government is this:
They might try to do regulation with a soft hand, minimal invasion/control.
Over time what happens is they add more and more regulation on top of it... to the point where, well, look at just about everything.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:51:56
Notice how they used Gox price not the price spread across the rest? It never dipped under 400. Rebound in a day.

You could local. Now how many local people have that kind of cash on hand is another story.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:47:21
Yep there are only so many BTC to be made and you can not just make more (unless you of course fork it, and I assume that wont go well )... plus you have to mine it...cant make it out of some 30 dollar case of paper and fancy ink.
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:06:36
I look at it this way:
Over a year ago people were moving 10K BTC at a time, worth just a few bucks, now we sit here and wish we could have that many.
Not long ago people were moving 100 BTC, worth some money but not that much, now we all sit here wish we could all have that.
What I see soon is we move 1 BTC now, but down the road, there are going to be many many people who wish they could own 1 BTC at once.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:44:37
Government fear BTC because its something they can not fully control. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:50:39
Yes because it will be so fun having your funds help up for an untold amount of time because PP is playing games. I am sure your sell @ 700 and is held up while they "investigate" only to see the price dive... yeah that will make you all warm and fuzzy.
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:16:59
The very guy would would gladly take it up the backside by some centralized power.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:30:08
I think the 600 mark was a psychological wall. This is true in BTC as it is in the stock market. Now that it broke 600 people are feeling better about buying into it again.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:38:10
Welcome to the tax hell called the IRS. Dont worry, they will tie you down indefinitely until you can get this resolved.

Legally they have to.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:29:50
Sadly , this is the case all too often. People think that just because it has not happen to them, its all good... false sense of security.  Many of times, people got funds froze at random times just because they can... to verify ect ect, and there is squat you can do about it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:31:31
Yeah i doubt someone wanting to stay hidden would have put real name on the project.

Why the heck is it even online to be accessed ???!!! I dont have anything to do with gox, but still, this is just ripe pikins for hackers to run rampent stealing people info.
How... fricken... STUPID.... can you get gox??!
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:09:44
Then he either needs to release the info now, not whore himself to the media. What he is doing is nothing short of bribing then. If what he has is so damning, release to the community and let the damn chips fall as they would.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:52:02
Arthur, if this is you ( I think it is legit due to the photo analyzed ) I think that you will not find many people who would support the lady and for what she did, let alone how she presented it.

O dear dont get me started on PP....
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:27:57
I hate ebay, and I hate paypal even more.  They do everything they can to fuck over the seller. Many many people have had issues with them.
Sad thing is, just like your damn cable company, what other options are there?
Thankfully there is amazon, but that still is not an auction place... 
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:42:11
"cough" politicians "cough"
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:50:59
Think of it this way.
Not many people are even going to own 1 BTC some time down the road, let alone more than one at once.
This is long term as few people have said.
I did the same thing with a few alt ( not the place to discuss this tough ,using as an example ).... held for around 6 months and went from a few buck to a decent amount of money.
IMO, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there. The real key will be when more major retailers start to accept BTC as payments. When that starts rolling, I think that is go time and grab as many as you can, sit on them for 10 years and then buy your own island.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:46:43
Yet no one over the years, the group of biggest geeks, and everything in between, could not find this guy? What a joke. You really think this is for real?

"Even so, **USD** is vulnerable to massive theft, fraud and scandal,"
These idiots think its just BTC used for this type of activity.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:00:39
See , right here with your comment is exactly what is wrong. You have the mentality that most people do. You think people only would use this for illegal things, all of which can also be done with FIAT. I can bet you for every one person who would/ has used for illegal means, there are 100x more that have used it for legit things like buying stuff.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:50:17
First off... The US is not a democracy... 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:44:18
Then tax the shit out of it, and if it still moves, regulate it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:42:25
Who didnt see that coming.
Bottom line is, for those calling for regs do not understand that even ....EVEN if the intentions start out meaning good and are with a light touch, politicians just love them some more power/money.
Government = Bankers and wall street.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:12:50
I hope he accepts it.
IMO, I think some charity donations every now and then would be good publicity for Bitcoin too. More so right now because the image of Bitcoin is that we all are uncaring, hate everybody, white males.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:14:10
Dear Gosh, this is tanking like a lead ball right now. We have lost so much ground in value that we all worked hard as a community to get. All going down in a few hours.
And there is no explanation for it . This is not like Gox.

So you think polishing means your funds will magically reappear?
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:04:14
The FBI single handed could crater the BTC market as we know it. 29K BTC flooding in would drive the price down only who knows how much.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:51:03
Dont not fear. The markets are bound to correct really fast and hard when the funny money dries up from the feds. Only reason why the markets are doing great is due to the fact near 0 interest tends to fuel it. The economy is not any better than it was 5 years ago... just things for job losses have slowed down. The economy is still very bad no matter what the media tries to tell you. When people are still going on UI at a fast clip paired with weak hiring numbers, yet the UI number goes down... that should tell you how its all manipulated.
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:48:08
Thats the media... not us. I think many of us in the crypto community would have rather just left this guy alone.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:51:02
Boy, if its anything like windows, we will get blue screens every day.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:02:36
This is another reason why I think we need a necessary evil and that is some types of regulation. Just like you need to have some form of government... you just need it in order to keep some order in place.
With that said, though not illegal, I think this is highly unethical to do something like this. I dont care if your an "early adapter" or just got into it last week...more so with this type of exchange where you can create all sorts of issues because you can manipulate whichever way, more or less breaking people either going long or short.
Quick edit here:
This would also make big money shy away from such things like investing in BTC. I know many people on WS are pretty much immune to such bullshit, but they understand risks and I think something like this going on would be a bit too much for them to take risks with, even if they wanted to do that themselves... 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:39:27
Well then that means one of these 2 things... 
1- BTC is highly undervalued
2- CoinBase is valued too high.
I am going to lean on  You dont get that kind of money just thrown at you unless there is some faith in the investment.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:09:45
Ahh coinbase, all I need to say is please dont end up like Gox. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:44:37
So how much will this crash the BTC price? After all, BTC always seems to tank when any kind of good news comes out.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:06:29
Yeah never mind people been looking for years yet newspeak found him in short order :rollseyes
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:14:41
Who cares? As someone who has been observing and holding BTC for a long while now ( 4 years )... even I can see changes need to be made one way or another. Right now, instead of being reactive, BTC has gotten bogged down by one of the very issues we poke fun of the banks and government as a whole, things need to be delt with quicker, not months or years.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:24:57
"I take your money and run"....
Shocker. Though I have to give the credit for they are why I got into crytos, well, the only place that really started the whole shitcoin trading thing, of which a bit later and I made tons on it... sad to see it go, but knew the writing was on the wall long before hand.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:53:04
You can not put value on the dollar for there is nothing to value it at. Its only worth as much as people say it is, and really, the dollar is losing value daily.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:28:30
Bad. I can see this used as a reason why the US gov would want to hamper BTC growth here. They would over regulate ( could not stop it per say ) so it would stop moving. Like they do everything else.
Im sure they can make a 2 page bill with the " to be added to at a later date" clause in it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:56:09
All I have to say to this is "DUUURRRR!" ... I mean what do they expect. Cryptos is much bigger than many people give it credit for.
This is just overstock dot com.... I mean imagine what the volume would be at say, Best Buy or Amazon??!
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:52:17
Yes but it still would be noticed. Like what was said, lets say they did take over the network and result in a fork... who is going to mine on that one? No one.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:47:15
He does make a point. I been dealing or observing BTC for a a few years now, and have never seen such bickering. 
To be honest, BTC needs to future proof itself. Its much easier to change NOW than it is as more users come on and BTC is used more.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:19:04
The lesson here op? I have said this many times over the years to many people like you... NEVER STORE YOUR COINS ON AN EXCHANGE! EVER! NEVER!
This is bitcoin security 101. You only put out there what your willing to lose, well, store anyways. At any time, any exchange can close shop, and this leaves you with nothing but months if not years of headache trying to get them back, if you ever do.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:25:42
Most likely because you went to go deposit coins only for them to be in limbo for hours if not days on end before they showed up.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:21:51
Well, that was a generalization on how stupid you have to be to do such a thing.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:11:58
Sure, next they will say they saw him eat a baby dog and snorts coke... that way they can paint more bad stuff about BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:20:10
Heck, I still have my keys in a bank safe box too. I have access to multiple devices as back up in case something goes crazy.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:16:29
Well said. Other wise they are not better than all the other exchanges that have gone under.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:39:35
One charges you huge fees to transmit money while the other one is pennies on the dollar...
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:09:14
I know right? Silly misleading title.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:17:44
Exactly. I had to give my mining up even for alt coins for this reason... it cost way to much to mine. Sure, I support the whole notion of bitcoin and the reasons for it, but its very hard for a individual to swallow up an extra 50+ bucks a month for nothing. In my instance I was spending 250 bucks extra a month on a 100 bucks if that in return... I could do that for a few months but eventually, you need to just stop.
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:18:23
The funny thing is, people will still do it again and get burnt again. Also, this will be the news the masses will hear, how people only use bitcoin for shady things, even though hundreds of good things have been done with BTC in that same time frame.
