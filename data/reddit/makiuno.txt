@_date: 2018-08-11 14:02:38
nope the math would be at 99.999....% if he kept throwing money at it, never will it be 0% loss since actual loss has already accrued. but of course you ask a question dont wait for a response and automatically assume i am a pro at this and my effective down could be 0% (thanks for assuming my answer for me). like i said keep assuming and i like bags i can afford it i'll keep carrying em. and everything is working great for me, retired at 33 and havent worked since and even if my crypto portfolio goes to zero i'll still be alright thanks for your concerns.
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:52:26
let me know if that math was wrong, because no where did that math state or assume actual losses hasnt accrued, that part was your assumption like everything you like to assume
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:36:58
if you top off your bags again u will only be down 31% :D
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:14:53
that's actually pretty low level and for people who didnt finish differential calculus where we never take the easy way out and assume 1/x will eventually reach zero, i think u need to go sharpen up on some +∞ differential equations to know there is no easy way out. and your really just reaching at this point to try and stay relevant...sad very sad
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:25:30
i never made any assumption he'll get anything back, where did you even read that from, i havent edited any of my posts, i simply said if he topped of his bag again based on what he told us hes new % loss would be 31% based on the new costs bases of topping off. it was a light hearted joke in this crashing bear attack to lighten the mood. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:36:19
and that statement u quoted me where does it state that i assumed Lowering your cost basis changes your actual losses? my statement if you actually looked at my pseudo math never once made any of those claims other than the original statement.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:38:48
based on % if he topped of his bag he would only be down 31% do you not comprehend how % works or do i need to explain that in further details. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:44:54
i like how you make assumptions and set up your own premises of what people have stated twist their words to fit your own frame. original statement hasnt changed you feel the need to educate people on cost basis when the original content was simple reload new % of total down only 31%, no where did i say ur actual losses has been reduced. but yes great way to get your point across when you didnt even follow the pseudo math and just assume that i stated 200 units.

@_date: 2018-08-11 13:20:37
he's down 45 units if he topped of today when he made statement of being down 45%, he starts with 100 he's down 45 he now has 55 left he tops off to 100 which is only 45 more, he has spent a total of 145 units, but he's still only down 45 units so it's now 100 left of 145 total spend which is new costs bases and only down 31% because 45 of 145 is 31%, i am not sure how u figure he's down 200 units if he only bought a total of 145 units if he topped off to his original 100 units.

if he started with 100 units and he is down 45% and he tops off again to 100 units at current lvls than he is only down 31% from his new total investment, i understand that this is just readjusting his cost basis but based on his new costs bases he is only down 31% instead of 45% of his new total investment.

I went to business school between 1997 to 2001, towards the end of it the big debate we had was online banking. We had professors debating with other professors and students about how online banking is the future and how the general public would never trust using internet for their banking needs. Even on cnbc at the time I recalled banking experts stating that it would be decades away if the general population would ever even considered using the service and how it be next to impossible to get Grandma and Grandpa to even operate a computer...well, I think we all know how that turned out...

oh i get it ur one of those i must be right u must be wrong types, and must keep arguing to prove your right. i like how you keep putting words in my mouth and making assumptions that i said he would lessen his losses, if you going to keep arguing like the keyboard know it all warrior that you seem to think you are please quote me and show me where i stated he is lessening his losses by adjusting his costs bases. if you cant please stfu and move along.

very true, so lets go with this month
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:47:39
i think the issue you're having is your attempting to assess a dollar amount to bitcoin or a sock or a rock, instead of using dollar amount use demand. but also remember bitcoin didnt just pop out of nowhere it took many years for it to get to where it is today. it's also got many unique features (i am sure you and most in this sub knows about them). 
think of it this way in 2009 1 individual started mining btc, he or she has all the supply it's worth nothing, now a year later 10k ppl has btc and some of them decided to use it as a medium of exchange, so demand for btc has gone up. 10 years later now over 10mil people have some btc and there are active platforms (exchanges) where people can now speculate that demand for btc so the trend continues. another 10 years from now 500 million people might have some btc and the demand for the very limited supply of btc will continue to drive its dollar value up. 
think of it like art, i am sure when da vinci painted the mona lisa it wasnt worth exactly 700 mil usd during his time, but over time demand for his art has gone up and it's scarcity or rarity remains so demand or its value has gone up along with it. btc in the same sense has stood the test of time (or at least 10 years of it) and over that period the demand for it has gone up as more and more people recognize its features and value. ,
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:47:07
lets GO, we got a schedule to keep to.
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:28:31
or you can inherit your btc from you parents and you're exempt for up to 5.6mil of value and not have to pay any taxes, so maybe brush up on your " Only way to not (legally) pay taxes is to never use your BTC." irs man, nice try though
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:53:32
just buy on coinbase using ur paypad debit card, it'll be instant and the fee is only 1.99 and you can send out right away. i think he'll be okay with .01371 vs .01389 btc
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:08:50
eh, you're like a special kind of stupid arent you? inheritance is one of the ways tax is bypassed on property, arts, and other assets. if btc is passed on to one as inheritance, it is accepted as asset class at time of, your parents bought it for 1 dollar, they pass it on to your retarded dumbass on X day where btc is worth 50k usd each, they left u 20 btc, along with a 1.2 mil dollar house, and 2 mil in art works, now you have 4.2 mil worth of assets tax free. if btc goes up at that point from 50k yeah u pay capital gainz, along with the value of the house/art and any other asset that was transferred over. SO AGAIN you pay no fucken taxes on those 50k btc should you sell them for 50k usd or less and spend it freely as you choose. and now you just grasping at straws stating,  "(with the exception that you sell them at thier cost basis, but at that point, it's like you never had them)." well sherlock no fucken shit you never had em, cuz you just inherited them. and my original response is to rebuttal your, " Only way to not (legally) pay taxes is to never use your BTC." which is obviously fucken false cuz i just showed you how zero tax is paid on spending btc if they were inherited, but you being the typical keyboard warrior is still attempting to argue when i've explained how one can spend btc without paying taxes on them...

i dont know what that means, if you sold and ur funds are now in usd, you can transfer it to your coinbase wallet on [coinbase.com]( or you can transfer it to your bank acct that's linked to your coinbase acct. what does transfering funds to increasing available balance have anything to do with your original question?
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:26:41
binance revenue is scary and easily calculated if all their reported volume is true. and this is one of the reason why wallstreet wants in on this cash cow, also one of the reason why all those crazy high btc speculation isnt to crazy when considering the forces and incentive behind the entities that wants in. 1 btc at 9k usd traded generates 9 dollar in fees, now at 90k that same btc will generate 90 dollar in fees. as long as more people/business get involved you can see why it's almost a guarantee that btc value will only go up with time.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:03:03
you have to transfer the funds from coinbase pro back to coinbase wallet they provide you to see the balance on coinbase. there are no "wallets" on coinbase pro just balance of coins and usd transferred to it for trades. so on coinbase pro where you see your funds (usd asset) hit withdraw, select the fund you want to withdraw, and select coinbase account and you should see the funds instantly on your coinbase wallet.

depending on the volume you're buying, online stock broker fee is extremely cheap when compared to any crypto exchanges' flat fee. for example i buy 100 shares of amazon it'll be 6.95 in fees for 170k spent, now if i buy 170k of any crypto at .1% fee that's 170 in fees. this is part of the reason why many brokerages want to get in on the crypto exchange business because the amount of fees conbase, binance, or any other high volume crypto exchange is making is insane when compared to traditional online brokerages.

i had bought 500 cxbtf on etrade and paid 6.95 in fees, and i just sold it yesterday (friday technically) and paid another 6.95 in fees. bought at 32.25 so was 16125+6.95, sold at 42.05 which was 21025+6.95. had i made this purchase on coinbase pro i would have paid 37.15 in fees instead of 13.9. But i had sold due to all the hype that etrade will be trading actual btc, also did this for my parents etrade account cuz they wanted in on the btc craze...but yes once etrade and other online brokerage starts custodial crypto trading it'll be interesting to see how they compete on the fee end of things.

Their job is to study the market and give their analysis on what they "think" will happen, no one is saying they're going to be right even most of the time cuz if that was the case we all be rich as fuck just following all these analysis they're throwing out there for free. at this point you all might as well just go get that palm reading or start cracking them fortune cookies for your winning lotto numbers...and also great job on all the "so obvious" "every moron knew" "you have to be an idiot" comments after the fact, next time when any of you got a time machine or a working crystal ball please make your analysis or predictions before the fact with actual time and price and let see how accurate your analysis are.

between sept of 2017 to december of 2018 i've put in 105k into btc/alt coins, first off this is money i can afford to lose, if it goes to zero i am not exactly happy about it but i wont be starving or homeless either. 
second i like that i am in control of my assets. no worries about bank errors or frozen accounts due to hacks or holiday shutdowns. all my coins are in ledger wallets and now seeing that stocks and other assets are being tokenized i will probably move all my stocks and funds off of my brokerage accounts once it's an option. 
lastly, 105k sitting in my savings account at 2% apy wont even beat inflation, and one thing that is certain is that cash sitting in any savings account will only lose value over time. yes my shitcoins might go to zero and it might go to the moon but it's a risk/gamble i am willing to take seeing the potential that lies in this promising tech.

Budget your investment as part of your monthly budget like you should be doing with bills, savings, emergency funds, etc. How do you know the next Amazon or btc isn't being worked on right now? So your reality is just go all in on btc and wait or hope it works out? Yeah you keep dealing with your reality and stick to that all in investing mantra. I'll continue to diversify my investment, where crypto is only 4% of my entire portfolio.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:39:10
why not diversify? when you invest in stock and funds do you just pick one and let it ride? also how come 10k at once, if you have a monthly income/budget would it not be wise to spread out your investment over time instead of trying to time a bottom or get caught at the top?

less than 4% of my total investments that is diversified like a mofo, also i never understood this whole disclosing your investments which could lead you to be a victim, i mean forbes literally publish annual list of wealthiest people in all types of categories. and if criminals needed wealthy targets it's pretty much any wealthy neighborhood or the people who likes to flaunt their wealth in jewelry  expensive cars or all the btc/crypto gears/clothing they be pimpin. but if some how, some way, some online evil genies is able to get my crypto holdings from my supposedly super safe hardware ledger nano s wallet, than i am okay with being an example of why disclosing amount spend on crypto can lead to lost of funds on hardware wallet.

The best thing all of us can do is to spend it. More people know about it faster it spreads, talk to your local mom and pop store owners, tell them bout the fees saving over visa, tell em about new potential clients, explain how they don't need a bank and transactions are practically instant instead of having to wait 24 hours like the credit card processing. Tell your friends and family, teach them about mobile wallet how it can be used for payments or personal investment. The more people use it the faster we gain mass adoption.
