Direct action at OneCoin events looks like a laugh, along the lines of Florida and Melbourne.
It's all very good looking down noses and dismissing OneCoin as an obvious scam for the gullible, but the dangers of knee jerk authority action in its aftermath damaging crypto in general is very real.

This is a weird thread digging up some bullshit from Onecoin that happened over a year ago.
They had one meaningless "audit" (how do you audit a blockchain? And why?) by Semper Fortis, signed by Dian Dimitrov way back in 2015.
The shit hit the fan, Dimitrov was sacked, Semper Fortis changed their name to SF Bulgaria and never had anything more to do with Onecoin. 
Dimitrov became Ignatova's bitch (like Principe from FinancialIt) and calls himself S System, rubber stamping whatever she tells him to.
Even Onecoin saw the total lack of cred in their monthly "audits" and haven't released one this year.

OneCoin's pitch is attractive to non crypto people because it's easy and inclusive, just "Give us your money, press a few buttons when we tell you and you'll live happily ever after".
Trouble is once they're in, they're in. That's something you could point out to him, where's the exit door?.

If that's the one with Ed Ludbrook "Chief Learning Officer" sic of OneCoin unable to answer some basic questions about their supposed blockchain, then I know Oz at Behindmlm.com would love to run it if you can send it to him.

The two year lock-in (CoinSafe sic) is optional and pays (or won't) 12% return. Normal accounts are allowed to list up to 7.5% of their coins per month for sale, but listing usually come back as "unfilled".
There's a big gray market in Onecoin, people dumping at 90% discount to the theoretical price of about 6 euros.

Giancarlo was always an arrogant, ignorant dick.

Ignore it, it's some sort of spam bot. Or a moron.

OneCoin pumped this hard at the time, saying Ignatova was "speaking to Presidents" etc.
Truth is (was), if you scroll down to 'speakers', you'll see she had 15 minutes of fame in the morning on Day 2 in exchange for her Platinum Sponsorship. These events are put on by a separate commercial entity to the Economist, they just whore out their name.

No, because you don't know how many ways those 12.5's are sliced.

"if all shares are bought by sending BTC to one publicly known address"
That's a fairly big if.
I'm not saying Via is a Ponzi, I'm more interested in their support for Unlimited, presumably with Bitmain's blessing.

What is the relevance of "BitClub Network" in the title? Do they have anything to do with this App or is it just J Ryan Conley piggyback marketing his latest MLM scam?

Agree completely, apart from Joby Weeks founding it. 
Confusion might arise because if you pay $3500 then you can call yourself a 'founder'. MLM pumpers like Weeks, Conley, Abel etc. are all 'founders', gives them more matrix legs.

Bitclubpool is running about that, just recently jumped from 10Ph. According to this  most of the increase has a ref 'fury' attached, which indicates they may have spent some of their hard shilled for $$$ on Bitfury 16nm gear. Not all the mining done in their pool is for them, as refs clearly show.

There's a quite amusing thread on BCT about these guys
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:44:00
Not quite, although that's the impression they like to give. Their "sponsorship" was paying $3500 for their logos on the conference tote bags.

Clubcoin is a worthless irrelevance as are the promised other toys. When BitClub crashes and burns after the MLM parasites have filled their boots, Bitcoin involvement will be seen as negative by the suckers who get stiffed. 
You're not big enough to survive the halving, the MLM overlay will prove too expensive to maintain. It will soon be time to move on to the next Jeunesse, Zeek, etc. for the motormouths.

The only way to make money in Onecoin is referral commissions.

2.5 million, according to Onecoin.

My favorite bit was when she pointed at the big screen with the Shutterstock vid going, representing the Gnosis block mining 2 billion coins in a minute, and squealed
“And now it’s blinking, I think it’s done soon!”

40% of MLM commission goes into a "Trading" account which can only buy mining tokens/coins (mandatory).
The other 60% goes to a "Cash" account which is the only account that has access to the Real World (thru 10 day! bank transfer @ 30 euros a pop).
I don't doubt it will be more and more difficult to withdraw from the "Cash" account as the scam enters its final stages, but my point is valid that the only way to get real money out is referral com via cash account route.
