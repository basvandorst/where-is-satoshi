On the internet, everyone assumes you use a pseudonym. That's why no one would ever suspect that your name is Mordhau.

"Warm wishes" is a well known expression. "Warm Satoshis" as seen side by side implies a Satoshi is some sort of wish. Obviously, that isn't the case. But then the expression becomes weird.

What does that have to do with bitcoin? An iPhone *overall* is more functional than a banana. But in terms of bitcoin functionality, they are the same.

That last guy has the right mindset. I was honestly shocked when it happened.
It's not that bitcoin sucks, or that MS is evil. Just that it seems like something they wouldn't do until it became more mainstream.
Then again, MS seems to have been on the bitcoin bandwagon for quite some time now.

To be fair, those first two comments I'd agree with. Logical thoughts at the time. The second one in particular is interesting. He seems to be against virtual goods in general, not just against bitcoin. This would make things like WoW gold farming to not be "particularly...efficient. Or sensible".
Bitcoin certainly isn't the first virtual thing to gain real value, nor is it the last.
The first comment seemed to be more unsure about the start of bitcoin, rather than when/if it finally becomes a main currency. He seemed more concerned about using it to generate profit, rather than using it as a currency.
Both are interesting comments that don't really apply any more.
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:35:11
You must be in a really tech heavy place. Most people I know either have only heard of bitcoin briefly and don't really follow it (they had no idea about the bitcoin founder being discovered), and the rest have no idea what bitcoin even is.

I'm just surprised that there's someone who has different views than me, but I can completely agree with and acknowledge the points they make. That hardly ever happens. Typically the other side is just someone being an idiot.

Which means if he *is* Satoshi Nakamoto, then both statements are useless. But if he isn't, then it's just confirmation.

Or, you know, begin contributing once they create an account in general. I don't see why fake content is limited to new accounts. Plenty of longstanding reddit accounts post fake content as well.

I remember seeing it at $15 each and thinking "damn, $15? that's ridiculous. It'll obviously crash soon." Forgot about it and checked back a while later and I see it capping $200. Forget about it and check back 6 months later and it's hitting $700.

That's how you get in. You always have to have one major fuck up. I have my own personal story as well. Ran a sniffer on the school network, and was able to get into a teacher's email.

Sounds like an awesome idea. Just curious about one thing... how do you apply *fractions* of gift cards? Like in your example you applied a gift card for $53.80. How does that work exactly? I'm guessing amazon's API lets you split gift cards? Or can you just buy one for a fractional amount?
Either way, seems like something that'd bring a lot of people to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:56:26
To be fair, it's a writing assignment, not an art assignment. You're supposed to write it in english as well, and backwards isn't english (technically). I can see where the teacher is coming from in this case.
Still kind of cool. I'd have given an 'A' for creativity.

**Edit: A "faucet" is just a site where you punch in your bitcoin address and it gives you a small amount of bitcoin for free (after typing in a captcha). It's to get people interested in bitcoin by providing a little for free to see how it works.**
I use [this faucet.]( that is basically a "faucet circle". It keeps linking to new faucets until you get back to the first one. Gets me around 0.00005675 every time IIRC.
I used that really old faucet that was up around 2011. It gave 0.001 bitcion or something (but you could only use it once).
I also did some of those really sketchy "get free bitcoins by doing surveys and other crap" things. I'm familiar with them (used them before to get free games and shit) and getting bitcoin wasn't all that different.
Just google "free bitcoin" or "bitcoin faucet" or something similar and just look through the links. They don't give much bitcoin, but it's at least something :P. I'm just playing around with it and don't expect to seriously use my coins. But I like having the knowledge that if it *does* explode, I'll have a small chunk of that.

For  You can't spend it at walmart the same way you can't spend euros at walmart. And you can't spend it at various retailers or restaurants the same way that you can't use credit/debit cards.

I'm in west coast and I hardly see them. I know a few people with them though. But we don't call them "barefoot shoes". Something like "toe shoes" or "those weird shoes with a spot for each toe" is what is said usually.
We have socks that do the same thing as well, if you want to wear socks with those shoes.
