Anybody else cringe at this? OP seems like a attention seeking social justice warrior who thinks too highly of themselves. This article makes you comes off as cunt, i mean honestly why the fuck else would you have to point out that you ride a motorcycle, reminds me of girls who game who have to tell the world that they too can play multiplayer games like cod.
This story isnt about bitcoin, its about op using a bitcoin meetup to talk about her self.

Of course ignore everything wrong with story and how its negativly effecting bitcoin amd focus on the fact i used the word cunt to discribe someone obvously trying to exploit something here.
Common fucking sense here people, im not being sexist, the writer of this article may have been groped at a meetup but what the fuck does that have to do with bitcoin?  And why is it important for us to know?
Replace the hobby of bitcoin with any other mostly male dominated hobby and youd get the same article
even if op isnt tryimg to show btc in a negative light, the article has nothing to do with bitcoin, its all fluff, bullshit on the same par as darkwing08s and to the moon memes, all just wasteful uses of cyberspace that give other people reasons not to take us seriously.

Chance of sexism? Welcome to earth, your new here arnt you? Of course there is sexism everywhere,the problem with story is the writer is taking the actions of a one group and pegging the community as a whole as sexist. Its the same thing as a writer putting that the only use for btc is the silk road, any fan of bitcoin or even decent writer should know better then generalize a whole group of ppl for the actions of few. 
Am i the only one that sees the irony of this woman labeling the community as neckbeards while acting in the name of wanting equality?
