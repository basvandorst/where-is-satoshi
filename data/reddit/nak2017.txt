bitFlyer USA Inc. 
I have been using the newest US based exchange bitFlyer USA Inc. since it opened at the end of November with full regulatory approval and only the 4th US based exchange that has been granted the BitLicense by the New York DFS.
Awesome customer support, very fast ID validation, trades on the floor are instantaneous, and wires come in in way faster than Coinbase. Trading is easy, and it is a brand new exchange, and there are NO FEES till the end of December. Anyone who uses Coinbase will understand that that means you are going to see quite a bit more money in your posket at the end of the day. 
The trading floor is a full Cryptowatch Chart Layout in high resolution that is built into what they have branded as their Lightning View Layout. All standard buy, sell, limit tools are included, and a pretty vibrant chat.
I opened a full verified account that is called Trader Pro, and it allows for a daily deposit/withdrawal limit $50,000.00 and unlimited transactions on the trading floor.
Deposit of BTC into the account in a given 24hr period are:
Trade Class: $2,000 (BTC equivalent)
Trade Pro Class: $50,000 (BTC equivalent)
They only take wire transfers in and out, no ACH, and currently no credit cards. 
They fully follow the KMC/AML regulations which is the only way that you can legally get US dollars into the cryptocurrency world, as well as be able to withdraw your funds as well.  They use a US bank, and my bank has had no problems with wires.
Currently they only offer USD to BTC, but they will be adding alt crypto coins in 2018. 
bitFlyer USA, a San Francisco-based virtual currency exchange for U.S. traders to buy and sell Bitcoin.  bitFlyer Japan, is currently the largest Crypto exchange in Japan. 
disclaimer: I am not an employee nor do I have any sort of official relationship with bitFlyer. I am simply a customer who has experienced a number of other exchanges and bitFlyer is hands down the best of the bunch
