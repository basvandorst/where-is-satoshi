yep, mostly its just people that want to see bitcoin crash. like seeing a trainwreck.. its hard to look away.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:52:54
exactly, this is the big reasonwhy bitcoins are soon to be monopoly moneys, let me explain..
americans are about to have major restrictions placed on bitcoin by uncle sam. **bottom line is ** this, the IRS is serios business. they will not allow bitcoin,  because one simple word: tax evasion.
bitcoin only has a chance by being small, like it is now. as soon as it gets big, bam! the banhammer will drop and uncle sam will be the one holding it.

duhhhh, china has already banned bitcoin. the chinese government will never allow bitcoin to happen.  if anything they will make their own digital currency.

haha! "completely anonymous"... thats a good one!..  bitcoin is traceable, truecrypt has a backdoor, webservers have logs, ssl has been cracked, tor has been compromised. somewhere along the line you will leave fingerprints that can identify you.

apple don't give a crap about you leaving they are too big to fall. they banned bitcoin and for good reason, it's illegal.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:03:30
haha! bitcoin you so funny.. this guy is banking with a bum holding a sign! such a scam.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:26:45


lol, you sounds exactly like a ponzi sceme. nice try, but i wont fall for you trick.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:11:59
well duhh, the only reason they "accepting bitcoin" is free advertising. the CEO of tigerdirect probably doesn't give a crap about bitcoin.
you realise they exchange bitcoin to USD immediatly?  no business would ever hold a bitcoin, they are like hot potatos, (they could we worth nothing in the matter of days)
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:14:30


and this is exaclty why bitcoin is doomed to fail. bitcoin offers no incentive for newcomers. lets compare bitcoin to credit cards for a moment.
bitcoin: huge fees (2-7%), shady as hell, backed by nothing, monopoly money
credit card: zero fees, multiple rewards (air mles, cashback, etc), backed by credit card company in case of theft or fraud, real money
@_date: 2014-01-26 11:09:59
not to rain on your parade but credit card woul have been much faster. how long to exchange bitcon to gyft? then how long to send gyft to papsa johnny?
its just cringe worthy, and a gimmick. bitcon has to be faster then credit card or nobody will use it. face it, bitcon isn't a currecny, its a fringe commodity.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:18:05
this is BullShit, bitcoin has fees too.
 mt.gox, blockchain, coinbase, et all. they all charging fees.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:04:56
why even bother printing the public key?? the private key is all you need to spend bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:54:26
the price is down and soon it will be zero. i recommend to sell while you still can. i sold most of mine at $900
@_date: 2014-01-25 09:56:32
i highly doubt it. tigerdirect isn't even close to the same level as amazon. TD is like a flea, and amazon is like a elephant. honestly TD is micky mouse, and their customer support sucks.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:08:30
lol! you cant even send a measly 150k with bitcoin? what a joke
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:19:04
rip bitcoin, 2009-2014
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:47:34


sigh.. you're in denial. he is qualified. the man won a nobel prize. is he says its a bubble, its a bubble. what do the fox say?
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:41:46
tigger direct got 500K in sales? yep they sure did, and they are part of the big scam. getting peple to trade hard earned dollars for monopoly money!
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:56:39
bingo! shrem's arrest is just the beginng of bitcoin downward spiral. bitcoin will be banned soon, jus wait and see. it is obvious to anybody that is objective. investors of bitcoin are subjective, they are emotionally tied to bitcoin, andthey masterbate to pictures of bitocoin.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:15:02
rip bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-23 11:43:17
bad news for bitcoin, sell while you still can. i'm selling mine as i type this. bitoin can't survive as a commodity, its a currency or bust.
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:35:27
and there you have it folks. "the direction is down, because it's too much of a fringe item". straight from the horses mouth.
i know all of us want our bitcoins to be worth more, but deep down everyone know the truth.... it will eventually go to zero.
