You multiply the number of bitcoins you own by the current price. It isn’t difficult math. Use your phone calculator. 
You buy 0.35783 bitcoin today at $10,532.70. 
That cost you 0.35783 x 10,532.70 = $3,768.21
Two weeks from now bitcoin is $14,346.22. 
Your bitcoin is worth 0.35783 x 14,346.22 = $5133.51
You have a gain of $5133.51-$3768.21 = $1,365.30
In % terms, your gain is $1365.30/$3768.21 x 100 or 36.2%.
So you just take the amount you own and multiply by the current price to see your gain or loss.

It isn’t a moral or ethical issue. It’s a legal one. 
Deliberately under paying or not paying tax is a felony in the US. Hefty fines, back taxes and even jail time can result. 
So reminding people of the rules isn’t advocating for taxation but merely a PSA to keep the average crypto buyer from ending up with huge problems.

Every state's money and banking laws must be followed. It isn't the bitcoin regulation that restricts the exchanges. It's the state, federal and international regulations on banking, securities, currencies, etc.

A private key is generated when you create any type of wallet address (public key). It is paired with your public key. You move bitcoin into any wallet by using your public key. It is your bitcoin account. You can share your public key so others can use it to send you bitcoin. 
Your private key protects that public key (account). No one can send funds out of the address unless they have the private key. Once generated, the key pair is forever linked.  It is encrypted and considered unbreakable by anything short of a quantum attack.

Fees depend on which exchange you use. In the US, you will also owe short term capital gains tax on each trade that shows a profit although you can deduct losses form the taxable total. 
And it sounds so easy to flip it like you state, but in reality timing is nearly impossible for the average investor. For example, sell today and lock in that $400 gain. What do you do if bitcoin rises another $600 after that?  Panic and buy?  So then it drops back to $4800. Now what?  Sell before it drops more or buy more hoping it goes back up?

Both. If they allowed large limits at the outset, they would be setting themselves up for fraudulent chargeback schemes where someone opens an account, buys bitcoin, moves bitcoin and then contacts their bank or credit card company to protest charges. 
Then they have to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. This is where your ID comes into play.

 No you cannot instantly deposit USD to your Coinbase account. If you purchase via bank payment you do receive your buy at the price at time order was placed. If you want instant buys you have to either use credit card with higher Coinbase fees, wire transfer money in 2-3 days and pay fee, or use free ACH transfer but wait 5 days.  Once you initiate cash transfers, consider opening a GDAX account to trade there instead of Coinbase. Cash and coin transfers are free between Coinbase and GDAX.

Sorry but I’ve never used Kraken. I can say that GDAX is very easy to use, but only if you want the big 3 of BRC, LTC and ETH because those are all you buy. I like the ease of placing limit orders and post-only option to lower my entry price and my fees. Since it is owned by Coinbase, transfers are instant and free between your accounts. Moving from Kraken would result in whatever fees Kraken charges for withdrawals plus network fees for that currency.
I use the regular transfer from bank to GDAX so that I always have funds available for trading. Unlike Coinbase you can’t use a credit card or buy now to lock in price but pay using ACH from bank. You have to have available funds in the account to place orders. 
Bank transfers to GDAX take 4-5 days to clear per bank ACH standards.

If you buy using bank withdrawal, it takes 6-7 days to show up.  If you transfer USD to your Coinbase account, that transfer takes 4-5 business days. If you then buy using the USD already held on Coinbase, the buys are instant. Instead, though, move that money to GDAX and buy there. Free transfers between Coinbase and GDAX.
But for those impulse buys where you don't already have money on Coinbase, you're stuck with credit card high fees if you want instant buys or waiting 6-7 days for cash transfer buys.

Couple of bits of advice. Don't post your salary on a public forum. Bitcoin: buy small amounts over a period of time to smooth out the price fluctuations. This is called dollar cost averaging. It's a time proven method to use with any type of investment. Since no one knows what bitcoin will be worth in 1 hour or 1 day, accurate predictions for 1 week, 1 month, 1 year or more are purely guesses.

 My original question remains. How did Coinbase take all your money?  Your title is completely misleading. If transactions didn’t go through, they took nothing. If 3 transactions now go through, it’s because you initiated 3 transactions. Claiming Coinbase took all your money is disingenuous and makes it appear like a massive Coinbase failure, or just more FUD about Coinbase. They didn’t take anything.

Honestly you could do most of the planning yourself and save money. Or at least educate yourself to minimize planner’s fees. Read up on cap gains taxes. [My article on that. ]( 
Search gift Taxes in the US. Here’s an article [on Forbes.com]( 
Excerpt: “Totally separate from the lifetime gift exemption amount is the annual gift tax exclusion amount. It’s $14,000 for 2017, stuck at that level since 2013. You can give away $14,000 to as many individuals as you’d like. A husband and wife can each make $14,000 gifts. So a couple could make $14,000 gifts to each of their four grandchildren, for a total of $112,000. The annual exclusion gifts don’t count towards the lifetime gift exemption. Stuffing 529 college savings accounts or funding a gift trust are two ways to prepare your heirs for college.
When you’re making gifts to children and grandchildren, keep in mind that there’s a federal kiddie tax that covers students through the age of 23 and puts investment income, above small amounts, into the parents’ tax bracket. For 2017, the kid pays no tax on the first $1,050 of unearned income and then 10% rate on the next $1,050, the same as in 2016. It pays to make gifts early in the year.
If you want to make gifts and not have to bother to keep track for gift tax purposes, you can make gifts for medical, dental, and tuition expenses for as many relatives (or friends) as you’d like so long as you pay the provider directly. These gifts don’t count towards any of the limits.”

You can treat the BTC you held at the time of the fork as if nothing happened. Your cost basis of that is unchanged. When you sell, use your original cost basis and the sale price of those coins to calculate gains for taxes. 
Your BCH has a cost basis of zero. When you sell it, you will pay cap gains tax on the full sale price. 
In scenario 2, you would owe taxes on value of the BCH “converted” as sold at USD value at time of exchange. That value then becomes the cost basis for the amount of BTC you obtained at that time with that transaction. Fun record-keeping, huh.

If you plan on paying gains taxes there's no reason to fly under the radar with less than $10k. You only pay taxes on your gains when you sell a currency. The original purchase was made with money you've already paid income tax on. 
Sale price-original cost=gain. Tax rate varies. 
FIFO means when you sell any amount you are designating the first ones purchases to be sold first. If fractional you just keep rolling record. However you can also designate a specific lot. If you have BTC on Coinbase that you bought after other coins you have in a wallet, you can still sell those specific coins and pay tax on that transaction.

If you thought you were going to panic sell as soon as it dropped, then you shouldn't be buying. A better strategy woild be to move in gradually by splitting your investment dollars into 3-4 chunks. Use first chunk to buy bitcoin then for watch price fluctuations. Then buy more with 2nd chunk if bitcoin drops. Same with 3rd or 4th chunks. It fluctuates wildly, so pick levels that you're comfortable with. 
Here's how I started. $1000. Bought $300. Then I set buy limit order for another $300 at 5% and 10% below current price. 2 days later I had $1000 worth of bitcoin at lower cost than if I had bought it all at once. Of course, if it goes straight up, you miss the buys. But it usually fluctuates enough that you can use limit orders to get it at lower cost than just buying at current market bid.

 Not quite true.  You owe the appropriate capital gains tax on the earnings PLUS a 10% penalty. Cap gains rate depends on short vs long-term and your annual AGI; a good estimate is 15% of that 700 plus the additional 10% on top of that. 
So it isn’t as simple as 10% of the net gain.

It’s difficult for anyone to personally collect money for charitable reasons. I have a very trusted profile on a couple of tight forum platforms gained over the years by always doing the right thing and getting great feedback, and a strong eBay profile from selling personal high dollar used items. Occasionally I collect donations for a local cause via those forums, but most would never trust an anonymous person on the internet to collect funds for charities.  Coincidentally I’m trying to pull together a small number of donors from my network to help a specific family in Puerto Rico, as well. The problem is that they need power, food, water, fuel, etc more than money. We can’t get those to them, but the national charities can. 
I’m sure your post was well-intentioned, but it’s much safer to donate to legit charity of your choice with fiat, as they can handle distribution to the resources specifically needed in each situation.  At least in 2017 a cryptocurrency solution isn’t needed. BTW, key word is “legit” which to me means low overhead expenses and no history of diversion of funds.

It is when the hardware wallet is unplugged and safely stored. No less safe than a paper wallet. Marginally safer actually as I didn’t have to worry when creating the seeds and PINs. 
So I disagree with your statement completely. The private keys are offline. That’s the very definition of cold storage. Is there a “colder” way?  I don’t believe so. Neither the Ledger nor Trezor can be keylogged.  They are just as likely to be stolen as a paper wallet, but then I would have to be attacked to give up my PIN. Unlikely.

You have to have a bank account linked to your Coinbase account in order to buy with cash on GDAX. Once linked, you can use the "deposit" function on GDAX pages to move money from your bank account, or you can move from bank to Coinbase and from there to GDAX. ACH transfers take 4-5 days to clear. Transfers are free.
You can buy on GDAX at whatever price you set in your order. So if you want to buy at $3500, set a limit order for that price. Use the post only option to knock down fees. Even when using market orders, fees are still much lower than Coinbase.

Yes. It sounds like your bank blocked the transactions.  Coinbase has no option but to cancel if a card doesn't go through. 
Make sure your bank allow Coinbase as an authorized vendor. If you accumulate too many canceled transactions on Coinbase using that method, Coinbase may block further buys using that method or lock your account due to the failed transactions.

It is not.  Coinbase is including them in your transaction history. Coinbase doesn’t determine what is or isn’t taxable.  Sending between wallets or exchanges in NOT taxable. I’m currently preparing a complete guide to crypto taxes. Won’t put all references here, but wallet transfers are simply not taxable.

Sale price less cost and fees - gain. List all those sales on form 8949 when filing taxes. Transfer 8949 totals to schedule D. Be sure to categorize short versus long term gains. 
IRS thresholds are single $37950 and married filing jointly $75900. Make less than those numbers and you isn’t have to pay long-term capital gains taxes. 
Short term gains are treated as income and all are taxed.

As others have noted, your tax basis will be the USD value you charged for the service but instead received in bitcoin. Record keeping with detailed notes is a must. Records should be entered as close to real-time as possible. Do not try to recreate them later. 
Your biggest problem is that you're generating short-term gains rather than long-term gains. Much higher tax rate. In addition, if forced to convert to pay bills at a time when bitcoin is dropping or when value is lower than the amount you normally charge for services, you are not getting same value for that service. Of course, if value rises, you get more. But then get taxed. 
Between federal and state taxes on gains plus tax on the actual income, accepting cryptocurrencies is currently looked at as just a novelty rather than experiencing the widespread adoption we all hope to see.

Thanks. 
For traditional assets, the IRS doesn’t allow you to switch between FIFO and specific lots. Unless you document your first sale by selecting specific lots, it is assumed you’re using FIFO. That means that your next trade must be the next coins purchased, and that sequence must be continued for that asset in that account. You get around that by just recording your first sale as “I’m choosing these coins for sale this time.”  From there forward, you must specify which lots.
Huge BUT: this applies to a specific asset held in a single account.  Easy with stocks, harder with crypto. You could use FIFO on Coinbase for BTC but Specific Lots For BTC on Kraken for example. Or specific lots for ETH on GDAX but FIFO for LTC on GDAX. 
Since many crypto investors transfer coins from exchanges to wallets and back or to other exchanges, FIFO is very hard to use.  It works best when everything is held on one account.  And I think it is best method to control my own tax liability anyway. It’s just harder to implement.

Actually that’s not always true. If you give an appreciated asset away, the recipient can use the value at the time of transfer as the new cost basis, and no tax is paid at the time of the gift. The new owner pays tax on gains when the asset is eventually sold but using the presumed higher cost basis rather than the original. 
But that’s not what the OP asked. He intends on paying the appropriate gains tax when he cashes out and then giving family money. The IRS allows up to $14k per year to be given to any person without recipient paying any tax because the money has already been taxed. He could instead give away bitcoin that the recipient could later sell and pay lower tax because they can use higher cost basis at time of gift. But there are complex rules and restrictions on that though, so get expert advice before,going that route.

This isn’t correct. It would seem practical to handle it this way, but the current status of tax law specifies that each transaction results in taxable gain or deductible loss 
I’ve said this in many posts: record keeping is critical but also a royal PITA. You have to estimate fiat value of both currencies being exchanged at time of the swap, record that gain or loss, and then us the transaction price as the cost basis for the new currency. 
Now imagine day traders. There are no automated exchange solutions for tracking all of that. It needs to change. Badly.

Do you have bitcoin to use?  If not you will have to open an exchange account or find some other source.  Once you buy bitcoin, you just enter his address into the send tool,for whatever wallet you’re using and verify before sending.  Coinbase charges high fees and has low limits at the beginning. Others can chime in about other places to buy bitcoin. 
If you are using bitcoin for a purchase remember that you have no protection at all on that purchase. If the seller doesn’t send the item or there are other problems, there is no way to get bitcoin back. Unlike PayPal or credit cards, there is no dispute process.  Once you hit send, he has the funds and you are dependent on the seller completely.

It is not true. There are so many misunderstandings on cryptocurrency tax laws.  You can move any asset, property or currency you own anywhere between accounts or even physical storage, and the IRS does not consider that a taxable move. It’s no different from moving stock shares from one broker to another, moving art work from one home to another, moving precious metals around, etc. The only taxable event occurs when selling the asset.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:27:45
Sale price minus original cost equals capital gain. If owned for more than a year, report it as long-term gain, less than one year short-term gain. Rates vary based on length held and overall income. Use form 8949 to list transactions and determine gain/loss then complete Schedule D which transfers taxable amounts to your 1040. 
If you anticipate taking large gains in one calendar year, it may be wise to make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties. 
Look for my complete tax guide coming soon. Just have to finish up some charts and polish up the example cases.  Sorry for the teaser but it is part of a much larger crypto project I’ve been working on for two months.  Sometimes my day job just gets in the way of the cool stuff. :)

Because Coinbase owns GDAX. An account on GDAX is just an extension of your Coinbase account, meaning you don’t have to go through separate validation steps.
There is no specific list of banks. When you link your account they provide a list of major banks for convenience. However, you can choose “other” and use the bank routing number and your account number to link to Coinbase. Coinbase doesn’t refuse certain banks, it’s the banks that refuse Coinbase transactions. You may have to get approval from your bank if there’s a problem.

The date of the trade will be recorded somewhere. Either in your records or an exchange record. From that, you (or the IRS, if they looked) can get some idea of the underlying asset prices around the time of the trade. Best estimate will work for reporting older transactions but it’s best to move forward with a quick record of date, time, est values, totals, etc for each trade.  Historical price records don’t always narrow it down much due to the wild intraday price swings.
I haven’t found a quote site that gives historical price on hourly basis. Pick the highest price for the date traded ;)

Technically in the US you have or record each sale transaction and calculate the gain to that point. Add up total gains from sales at the end of the year and use all of that to complete form 8949 and Sched D to determine taxes. 
Some tips:
1.  You only pay taxes on gains from sales not assets you still hold. The IRS expects you to report every trade whether crypto to crypto or crypto to fiat. It is impractical but that’s the current expectation. When you sell one coin for another, the cost of the new coin is price paid at that time so record keeping is critical to avoid overpaying.
2.  If your annual income is less than $37950 for individual or $75900 for married joint returns you pay 0% taxes on long term gains. That will exclude a lot of people.  There is 2017 tax proposal that may adjust that slightly. 
3.  Short term gains (assets held less than one year) are taxed at higher rates and no exclusions apply. Try to hold 366 days or longer. 
4.  Be sure to track fees, network expenses and transfers, etc as they count towards your cost and reduce your taxable gain.

I’m not sure how else to say this but transferring out is not a taxable event. The IRS doesn’t have a different set of laws for Coinbase.
The IRS has NOT created a special case for crypto. Just the opposite. Crypto falls under the same tax laws as stocks, bonds, precious metals, etc. It’s actually the opposite of what we want. Exchanges between crypto should be treated differently so we don’t have to report each transaction but just exchanges into or out of fiat. But they have not expressed that opinion as of this date. 
You are very misinformed on how this works. You don’t get to simply transfer out to lock in a tax deductible loss nor do you have to pay tax on gains when you transfer.  Coinbase can report in whatever format they choose because there are no regulations at this point. But the IRS does not consider transfers as taxable events.
Edited to add exact quote from Coinbase “We use a FIFO (first in first out) method for this report.  Transactions sending into or out of your Coinbase wallet are treated as buys or sells at the current market price in this report.  However, you should keep your own records for best results and update the report accordingly.  For example, if you transfer funds offsite to a desktop wallet, and then back again, you would not count this as a sale of digital currency.”

And even when you sell, you don’t have to use FIFO. Coinbase just uses that reporting method. There are better ways of keeping your own records to legally minimize taxes when you sell. But that’s a topic for a full length article.

Thank you. No, not by addresses or even exchange accounts. The IRS allows you to pick specific purchase dates as lots. Even splitting them up is allowed if you have records to document what you did.

Buy consistently at the same time every week. This takes emotion and guesswork out of the equation.  You may think you’ll pick the best times each week, but you’ll talk yourself out of buying hoping it will drop lower or you’ll panic and buy if price rises briefly. No way to accurately and reliably time price swings. 
Buy each week no matter price and you’ll average into the market gradually and not stress about whether you picked the best time. 
All of that assumes a general upward trend over the long term.  A prolonged bear market would result in getting more coins per buy but you still need the market to rise or none of that matters. BTW you can use the same strategy to cash out later. Gradually sell taking gains over time rather than in one lump.

SMFH and wondering why no one recognizes Ponzi schemes. Investment groups. Big returns. Can’t withdraw your original deposit. Recruiting giveaways.  Referral bonuses. 
I thought the internet exposed a large number of naive people to potentially lose money. Blockchain technology has unlimited potential that will only be realized when things like this get shut down. 
Wake up guys. Why would experienced investors who can make large sums of money need you to send in $25, $50, $100 or more?  They don’t unless they’re running a Ponzi scheme.
This crap is running amok on Reddit.

GDAX. Easy addition if you’re already Coinbase verified. Lower fees. More buying options. Easy transfers.

Withdrawing coins is not a taxable event. It is treated just like transferring money between fiat accounts. Taxable events occur when you sell a currency for fiat OR exchange it to another currency. In the latter case, you report the transaction gain or loss, and the value at that exact time becomes the cost basis for the newly purchased coins. 
But wallet transfers are NOT taxable transactions.

Perfect. And I accept bitcoin so it works out in my favor. 
Question though. When I invest in myself and use bitcoin purchased previously, is that a taxable transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:00:49
If you mean access point to the funds, then yes. In that respect it’s no different from a very strong password on an exchange. But your alternatives are to create paper wallets and write down the private keys or print them out. You also have to create those using extreme caution to prevent exposure to the internet and hackers.  Or you can trust a multisig wallet, desktop wallet, or mobile wallet. Google all of those are read about all of the hacks that have occurred.  Exchanges are less safe than those. 
Store the recovery seed in whatever random secure location you wish.  Secure multiple copies. I won’t share my method, but I’ve seen others use bank safe deposit box, relative’s house, buried in the backyard, stashed in a fireproof safe, randomly distributed portions scattered around so someone would have to find or steal all pieces of the puzzle. Be creative.

No doubt. But they have already determined using gold coins to buy silver or platinum etc results in a taxable exchange or buying yen with dollars and then later buying pounds sterling with yen as taxable exchanges. Most accountants expect cryptocurrencies would fall under those same rules. But it hasn’t been specifically addressed by the IRS nor have there been any legal cases to challenge or clarify the rules.

If the transactions didn’t go through, how did Coinbase just take all your money?
Also, when there’s a problem with one transaction, why do people insist on doing the same thing again?  Clearly something was wrong either on there end or yours. So why increase the amount and try again?  Does that seem prudent?

A dividend is a cash payment from a company's earnings; it is announced by a company's board of directors and distributed among stockholders. In other words, dividends are an investor's share of a company's profits,

BCH was not a distribution of profits or revenue.  It was not paid in cash. 
Now one could argue it is a spin-off, many of which are tax free. This is a new arena that the IRS has not yet defined.

There’s nothing illegal or shady about buying and selling bitcoin. The IRS just expects you to pay the usual cap gains taxes when you sell if annual income is above $37,950 for single filers and $75,900 for married filing jointly. Under those limits you have no taxes in gains. 
Just list the transactions on form 8949 then fill out Schedule D. It’s all legal if reported properly.

It’s OK and ethical. But the market decides who survives versus what products fail. So if fees bother the customer, don’t use the product.

Actually they are not. They allow their account holders to link personal bitcoin holdings to their Fidelity accounts for investment tracking and performance monitoring reasons. 
But Fidelity itself is not invested in bitcoin nor do they buy/sell for their clients.

No. Set your limit price and amount and GDAX either sells the full amount or fractional amounts adding up to the total. Unless you place a very large order, the entire sell will happen quickly.

You didn’t say “hidden” in the OP. You asked if it is ethical to charge a fee. Plenty of free software comes with micro transaction options.

Porsche doesn’t sell direct to customers. Dealers do. The distinction is important for anyone who wants to push for bitcoin adoption. Lobby the dealer specifically, and maybe they would accept bitcoin once educated.
