They are part of the reason Bitcoin is currently as highly valued as it is. Every lost or forgotten coin adds to the price ultimately because it decreases the supply.

You're not missing anything, they just don't know what they are talking about.

I don't disagree with the sentiment, but just pointing to the practical reality that  mathematical cap to bitcoin (and all assets) does exist.

Quick and dirty calcs show me that this would be about 16 trillion in bitcoin market cap aka just short of the entire national debt aka very fake news. It's like they aren't even trying anymore.

ur tax advice is worthless and I am sorry to inform you that you are indeed a ch0de.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:02
So do you really think that bitcoin is going to be worth over a million dollars in the next decade?

Hi, Bitcoin noobie here. Anyway you could expand on this a little? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:47:47
I just paid 12$ to transfer $190, I am honestly disgusted. These high fees were EXACTLY what bitcoin was supposed to prevent. I hope it goes down to 50c a coin .

Xapo to bitpay

Lol. You hating on someone bc you have 50k? You must think you are a big boss. Sorry but u are still a little fishy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:32:57
Because it was a JOKE 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:44:08
Why didn't you take it out at $200 if you are the GOAT bitcoin price predictor?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:48:24
we'll see

The chickens have finally come home to roost. Goodnight sweet BTC prince. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:18:51
Everyone has a plan until they get hit. But even people who pride themselves on being strong hands are going to get whomped.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:27:59
Lol. Don't kid yourself, this sub would go nuclear if BTC went back to 3k. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:01:27
I don't have a problem with these industries complying with financial regulations... what I do have a problem with is holding my money hostage with no prior forewarning. I feel they were very unethical the way they went about it. They locked up funds at a time that they were critically important to me (tuition payment due that night) and it was a major problem. Not to mention how intrusive the KYC was... it was honestly embarrassing that Xapo now knows how much credit card debit I have etc.

the bot you're talking about Libartus, is far far far more powerful than the poker bot that is available to the average botter (at this point). Secondly it only plays heads up poker. Bots do exist, and are a concern. But the games are still very beatable, but they won't be that way forever.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:12:51
I saw it too, seemed a little too dicey to me 
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:13:18
I feel like any fork will attract a lot of attention. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:36:58
Wait till the coast is clear in mid August, fish
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:47:50
The relevant date, as well all know, is April 10th 2032
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:12:57
ok lol, given that the first two answers are 0% and 100%, the current wisdom of the crowd concludes a fork has a 50% chance of happening.
