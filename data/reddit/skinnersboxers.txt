Oh yeah not saying I have an issue with it, but I thought it was good to get some perspective on the matter. There's a lot of circle-jerk/ hivemind/ moon talk here that adheres to the bitcoin bubble cycle and sees it as inherent to bitcoin as a protocol, but then you have guys like this who are taking it seriously and are literally talking about it being both a commodity and a payment system; something that will be an issue for banks, will be an important part of portfolios, and could at some point make up the pipes and wires of the trading system. It's refreshing to find  something that appeals to my confirmation bias from guys like this. Mmmm good dose of confirmation bias.

First of all it's difficult to make any statement about whether or not any company that begins to take Bitcoin as payment will hold it in Bitcoin, fiat currency, or any mixture of the two, without knowing that company's view of Bitcoin, or their plans for the future. Unless you have access to information about this, then we just don't know.
Secondly, this has the potential to turn the subscription model on its head. Micro transactions have been suggested to be an alternative to advertising based revenue in online publications, and subscriptions have clearly not cut it. People who aren't particularly tied to a publication aren't going to go and subscribe if they only want to see one article that they want to read is behind a paywall; we know this is the case, and so do publishers.
IF Time were to implement micro transactions as a payment mechanism for single articles, then we suddenly have a situation where people who wouldn't have spent any money at all to read an article are now spending a few cents via Bitcoin to gain access. So Time has the opportunity to turn non-subscribers into Bitcoin holders just like that.
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:19:36
The subscriptions are handled by Coinbase, so they will presumably handle the microtransactions off-chain.
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:51:33
I think they hope to add facebook as well in future. Like I said, bitcoin can be send to anyone with a bitcoin address, changetip just allows you to do it to peoples' usernames.
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:01:31
... and who told you that they're not holding any proportion of revenue in Bitcoin?
Even if they weren't, it's likely that at least some of the money that Coinbase takes as a cut of their revenue is likely to be held in Bitcoin, so it's not price neutral.

I don't know much about the online advertising business, but a quick google threw up a figure like $1 per 1000 banner views. So each individual page view is one 10th of a cent. Even charging 1 cent for one article would increase revenue in that case.
I'd like to see how many people view pages but DON'T subscribe when they realise it's paywalled, because then we have an idea of the potential market.

I understand the issue, but don't understand why everyone thinks that an attack is imminent. Surely these people are in it for the money. By undermining the entire system they drive people away from bitcoin and the amount of value they can ultimately take out of the system, so it's in their best interests to maintain peoples' trust in the system.

Who knows! Given that it's an entirely new way of paying for content it's difficult to say what they'll do, but they can potentially increase their revenue by gaining customers who wouldn't normally have paid for the subscription just to read!

Poor video, with minimal references to Bitcoin. Also one of those videos that doubles the running length by duplicating itself.
Additionally, the reference to gold as 'shiny bitcoin' was a throwaway remark that come up while discussing how gold has no intrinsic value (beyond the fact that people want it), thus the implication on his part is that bitcoin also lack any intrinsic value.

Reposting from the other thread because this is quite significant if Time use this to support an alternative business model. Essentially your venn diagram needs to include people who don't subscribe, but would like to access individual pay walled articles.
This has the potential to turn the subscription model on its head. Micro transactions have been suggested to be an alternative to advertising based revenue in online publications, and subscriptions have clearly not cut it. People who aren't particularly tied to a publication aren't going to go and subscribe if they only want to see one article that they want to read is behind a paywall; we know this is the case, and so do publishers.

It seems to be a common theme everywhere. There's a clear progression  in the attitudes people an organisations have, based on the extent of their understanding
1. Internet money? How can that have value!
2. Oh blockchain! But we can utilise that technology separately from Bitcoin for our own reasons
3. Oh network effects + financial incentives for miners mean that Bitcoin is the most secure way to use blockchain technology.
5.Profit

Ads (I imagine) make up the bulk of revenue EVEN in cases where articles require a subscription to view. There are definitely exceptions (more niche publications with more expensive subscription fees), but yes, the reality is that content has to be paid for somehow.
At the moment, if we just take ad revenue, content is paid for in eyeballs, or page clicks, and metrics related to how many people would have been exposed to an ad. This has lead to an environment in which flashy and attention grabbing headlines to articles with short and easy to follow content are more lucrative (attract more revenue) than pieces that are longer, and potentially more attractive to niche markets. You may see the words 'churnalism' and 'clickbait' thrown around occasionally, and both refer to the perceived lack of quality in content that has resulted from the over reliance on advertising revenue. Things don't have to be interesting or well thought out. As long as they grab attention, and there's lots of them.
I looked up some ad revenue figures not long ago, and apparently a banner on a website can pay $1 for every 1000 viewers. Essentially the fact that you're viewing a page can be worth $0.001, so if the same number of viewers make a payment of $0.10, that same article/ page will have made $100,000 instead.
Now, that may not represent the situation here, but the hope is if you're giving the financial incentive back to consumers then they'll pay for articles that they perceive to be worthwhile.
As always, there's a CGP grey video that explains how advertising affects online content.

Interesting in the sense that we're starting to get a picture of the kind of industries that see bitcoin as a threat (Mastercard, WesternUnion), and companies that see bitcoin as an opportunity (Deloitte, Ernst and Young). Those companies that have a vested interest in maintaining control over the trust based system behind currency flow (and suck out capital along the way) are vehemently against the idea. Those companies that are concerned with increasing efficiencies see the potential.
It's not bitcoin vs the world. It's bitcoin vs the big banks, with everyone else watching on in interest.

There were some interesting comments about facebook there. I know that it's currently possible to send bitcoin through facebook with the use of third party applications, but can you imagine if each account included a wallet by default? Facebook would be motivated by the potential for seamless purchasing for their advertising partners, and the entire back end of dealing with bitcoin and sending to addresses could be replaced with sending it to a persons facebook account. That would be huge.

We know from recent news that there are plenty of business that accept Bitcoin and hold all or some of their revenue as Bitcoin. Although I accept that without a breakdown of the specific business it's impossible to tell if any are publicly traded.
Are publicly traded companies not allowed to assign some of their revenue to risky investments?
Even if it is price neutral, isn't this a good opportunity to increase Bitcoin usage by promoting microtransactions to people who have yet to buy in?
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:52:56
To be honest the price isn't the most interesting thing to me. It's a one off, and sure it would be nice to know, but wouldn't it be more interesting, to find out what their plans are? How they're going to grow the bitcoin infrastructure and invest it in developing countries? It would certainly tell us more about what the moon looks like...

We're in the opposite siutation (Australian, living in the UK), and I know exactly how you feel about the whole thing. Mum wants to send some money? Oh. Shit. How are we going to do this without losing too much to fees? So far I've just been making do with an exchange rate locked debit card, but CoinJar looks like it's in a good position to capitalise on Aus - UK remittances.
Coinjar is (was?) and Australian bitcoin exchange that recently moved its offices to the UK in order to get around the Australian ruling regarding GST payment on bitcoin purchases. Pretty simple to use if you have an Aus bank account; you deposit money via bank transfer and buy bitcoin. Shock horror. However! The team are currently working to develop the same functionality on the UK end, which would mean being able to deposit GBP funds into an account and have them come out BTC or AUD as you wish.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:41:02
Bitcoin has the potential to fundamentally change the world we live in.
Bitcoin has the potential to disappear forever, or be surpassed by a new and superior technology as soon as tomorrow.
It's easy to let the former possibility outshine the latter, but in reality you need to remind yourself that this is a gamble. If you have some money you know you don't need, and you wouldn't miss if you lost it, then fine go ahead investing it. But consider that money gone.

My understanding regarding the coins themselves is that they are manipulable units associated with a particular key pair. These units are distributed as a reward for mining or as transaction fees for including blocks.
The 'equations' you're referring to are the actual work that the miners do to be rewarded (and to create the blocks that will then be included on the blockchain).

@_date: 2017-08-31 17:00:26
It's not true to say that you can only store Bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain. Data can also be included in transactions. Take for example Factom, which uses the blockchain to create an immutable register/ paper trail. I believe one example of their work is to put land registry details onto the blockchain. Additionally, Kim Dotcoms most recent venture appears to be a way to use the bitcoin blockchain to stream/ share data but with financial incentives.

Nah Abacus is on Wood Street. They frequently host 'alternative' talks (grassroots organisation, monthly peoples' assembly meet ups), although their website has a better summary:
The Abacus is Cardiff’s newest creative space for Artists, thinkers, musicians, and other creatively blooded people to explore, practice and develop their ideas. The space is a collaborative venture between Cardiff based Arts Collective the Modern Alchemists and the dynamic organisation Promo Cymru. It’s hosts a gallery, event / project / workshop space, a rehearsal &amp; recording music space and artist studios and aims to be a platform for the grassroots creative community of Cardiff.
It's definitely the sort of place where you'd want to deliver bitcoin talks to a potentially receptive crowd.
