Looks. I'd print one if I had a 3D printer. I think the only case that has added usability are the ones that comes with built in heatsink

FYI, no point in using BTC ATM, unless you urgently need btc while not having internet connection and are willing to eat up 8-20% in fees

You don't need an internet connection, you'll still get your btc at whatever address you choose. Also, no need to have internet connection if you have a node with blocksteam satellite for example. This is like buying BTC at airport exchanges, huge price premium for a small convenience.

Right answer here.

Do it. LTC is irrelevant now that BTC has Lightning. Even libra is better than LTC.

The website was registered a week ago. VERY suspicious.
Even if the product is new, it's not like they would come up with the company name the day they decide to advertise it.

Why are we giving attention to the male version of the Kardashian?
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:13:57
Exactly. Nothing cheap about this, but we have to understand that developers do deserve to earn for their work.

It's a huge extra layer of decentralisation and censorship-resistance.

True, I know people flipping houses, the market was supposed to be shitty but the interest rates are getting artificially lower to make up for that... for now
