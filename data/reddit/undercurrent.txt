We will make it immutable but not really...

So now you can lose money instead of having your transaction declined. Doesn’t seem like a good idea.

I assume they have their own hardware
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:14:25
Yes but as in hardware exclusive to them. I think they call it AWS private cloud.

My money is gone, give generously, the high price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:29:06
Price will go up or miners will turn off their rigs.

Why not see a Dex as some sort of ebay where you sell numbers?

This happens far too often.
Also, Chainlocks drops fraudulent transactions (doublespend). As soon as a transaction is on the network with a lock but not included in a block (no confirmations) it actually is irreversible.

Lol, that’s going to be a long lunch break then.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:05:09
