Many people are looking for any reason to solve our common problem. Lets not pretend this symptom is the deeper cause. Its a disrespectful effect, that the law says I must collect these numbers and religious ads from an organization which makes them hard to get, but the deeper issue is that organization thinks they can make law in all 3 branches of USA government contradicting the separation of powers between those 3 which was for a very important reason, to balance power in smaller amounts. When that failed over the years, that was one of its effects. Another effect was the hostile takeover of our Earth governments and infrastructure for a few main things: To sell us creative content instead of mass producing it in far larger amounts for almost free, and more disturbingly, to deny average people the tech parts of any very advanced machine such as wireless mesh networks, bombs, bioweapons, country size flood emp and lightning attacks, quadcopters spraying gas through window cleaner nozzles and detonating miles of it all at once resonating light ever brighter blinding and radiating those looking at it... not to mention what a really smart person could do if they didnt want anything other than to do the most damage. Anyone could take out a whole minor variation of species just by carrying a few bugs or small animals across large distance and feeding them while they populate. Humans are so good at extincting species we dont even run a news story about it anymore. Its normal. How many fatally poisonous flying insects, bacteria, or ocean slime are widely available just far away? How much floating black paint, thinner than oil and designed just for such a violent act, would it take to black out the oceans? How tiny a plasma drill does it take to open a volcano from a few hundred feet to the side? How thin a hole into it can mercury be pumped in to fall into the cracks and dirty frack it apart by surface tension? Were there small earthquakes from the analog radio towers before they switched to digital? The air is like a big capacitor. So this huge blob of whoever runs the world today have done things to make some of that less likely but in the process blocked the important paths of our species toward bigger and better things.

I would be a tyrant if I tried to use force instead of trying to get enough people to agree with me. If they do, few tyrants would oppose. Theres not enough tyrants for that to work.

I am an AI researcher and some of my data structures are similar to blockchains. I'm also interested in creating experimental ways people can motivate eachother, as motivation is part of AI, and cryptocurrencies are a kind of motivation with much potential. I do this [opensource]( and governments are welcome to play with it like everyone else.

A simple solution to budgets is already practiced by some parts of USA government where they "shut down" after a deadline until a budget is agreed on. The difference I suggest is a majority of the people have to agree on it, or by median vote, instead of someone we elected who can change their mind later when they see others wont go along with reducing taxes as we made them agree to before electing.

Value is whatever people think is valuable. When people are threatened into thinking its valuable to support secret processes in government, their thoughts of value are hijacked and its time to jack it back.

What if someone does a crime then exchanges that for bitcoins then tumbles them so much they spread through all the other bitcoins? Its not even defined in the bitcoin math which specific bitcoins go where since its done in blocks of incoming and outgoing money where as long as incoming is at least outgoing (and difference is a transaction fee) no further info is contained. So technically all bitcoins could easily be money laundered when any of them are after enough tumbles.
