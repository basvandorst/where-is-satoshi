In the motorcycle version, does the motorcycle run away and bring back other motorcycles too?

I had someone that I thought didn't know how to use a computer say "Have you heard about bitcoin? Well theres a coin that transfers faster called Litecoin."
Turned to my friend that I got into crypto and said "This is why 2018 is going to be crazy"

Sell 1 if money is an issue. Enjoy the rest of ur teens comfortably. But don't go spending it all on strippers. 
And give 1 to your parents as a gift.
Keep the rest.

Withdraw if he needs $. 
Withdraw X amount he invested/needs to pay debt and keep the rest in BTC - so rest is on the house and forget that you have it again until you need it.
Let it ride. Fuck it.

You're saying in a pyramid scheme the person telling you to buy bitcoin(the top guy) makes money.  A lot of people here are mostly in red. If im down 30% and you never bought bitcoin until now after I told you. You would be even. And if bitcoin goes up 10%, you're up 10%. I'm still down.

"Hold" on their app only. I believe you cant send or spend btc. Only keep the value of it.
