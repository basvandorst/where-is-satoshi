I think best way is to divide your income and invest in different things and use your saving for creating a cash flow.I believe btc is futures gold and I will always keep 20% of my saving in btc.

Haha if I tell that to them they would kill me lol.

Well I am agree with you but as you know even the platforms that wallets given is different than each other like btc org or blockchain.com so I think it can be good for some people and I believe it is going to effect the price really good.

But there are a lot of different coins with different features for example Monero.I think you should do is following technology and using whatever you need instead of being a fan.

That’s the time I believe it is going to hit million bcs as I see most of the people around me wants to invest just over their bank account for excample they buy gold and other currencies over their bank account.

I wish it would be the biggest reason lol.I know that it sounds something stupid for a bank but they just can’t see how to turn this a great opportunity and stop seeing  it as Cris.

It will be better investment next decade.I am 22 years old and I believe young generation will realize how great bitcoin and how governments manipulate us with money and use btc more.

It is like car business and the old horse  sellers was competing with making Cars with 100 horses lol but they couldn’t prevent the technology.

I meant like Wells Fargo, Chase and Bank of America.

I also keep some of my savings as bitcoin and Monero but How can we be sure that there won’t be a different coin as gold cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:49:22
Well I use btc core but I know that a lot of people around me want to get it but they don’t trust the platforms like coinbase and I thought it could be big hit for btc.
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:14:56
If I have a bank I will be the first one who makes it available to sell and purchase bitcoin over my bank.
@_date: 2019-12-07 06:22:40
I love bitcoin and blockchain because of that reason And I also keep some of money as btc but I am not that emotional about btc.I also realized that most of the people in here is approaching btc soo emotionally and they think it is something that will make them rich lol.

They can even make profit with getting commission.I know that a lot of people want to get btc but don’t trust third parties especially people over 30.
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:31:06
Nice point I think banking system needs entrepreneurs and innovations.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:45:34
Well I am from Turkey and most of the banks sell gold and other currencies and most people want to get btc but they are getting scared from getting it from third party.
@_date: 2019-12-08 02:18:20
Yeah I agree but if I were a bank I would use it help people to purchase btc and make a lot of profit instead of currency exchange platforms I believe most of the people hold the btc in their banks.I like hard wallets though lol.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:25:38
Well it is extra work with btc but I got your point.
@_date: 2019-12-08 12:40:13
Until someone finds a way to use it that will be more profitable.
