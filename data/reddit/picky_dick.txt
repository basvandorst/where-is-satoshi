the coin is just a coin, not a claim. They may say it's a claim but unless there is any legal agreement that this coin represents a bond or is redeemable for something else it is just a coin.
like that strange thing people call fiat money...

Protecting shareholders from what you are asking for was precisely the motivation for inventing **limited liability** companies in the first place ;-)

Given the large number of affected clients, a reasonable way forward would be for them to organise themselves and start negotiations with bitfinex representatives on the terms of this bail-in. It is not at all clear why Bitfinex should have an exclusive say on this, but understandably they are interested in getting the best deal to protect their own stake and to find an investor. 
You can complain on reddit as much as  you want, but organising yourselves is in my view the most promising way forward. And with that I don't mean class action.

Technically, you can only prove non-exclusive access. Ownership implies exclusive access. I can prove access to correct battery horse staple,  but so can you. 
Edit: typo
Edit 2: as was pointed out in another comment, you can only prove that someone who has non-exclusive access to an address holding X coins signed a message on behalf of your counterparty. That obviously tells you nothing about the control your counterparty has over those coins.

The math holds up to a scaling factor 1/s that we don't know, where 's' is the number of transaction per day for the 'average user'. Assuming s = 1, then this is very little, assuming s = 1/7 (one transaction per week), then you suddenly look at 84 million users with 20mb blocks.

What a FUD article. Any 'consensus' in bitcoin - particularly 'consensus' about which transactions did or didn't occur has actually been a simple majority or super majority vote. Therefore the premise of the article is strongly misleading. A democratic currency is by far superior compared to control by central bankers (moral hazard) as well as full consensus (limited flexibility to adapt).
I would argue that bitcoin failed if it can Not deal with hard forks, since anyone, including nefarious actors can fork the code and try to convince miners to use it.

Volatility is unlikely to decrease to acceptable levels relative to inflationary fiat due to bitcoins inelastic supply. Look at gold...

This is an extremely crude/ possibly misleading measure, but looking at the number of transactions that are part of long chains as reported by blockchain.info may be a starting point.
The difference in number of transactions today [including](
 vs. [excluding]( long chains is 100k.

If I give you $80 million or relieve you of $80 million debt in exchange for equity then yes, you are worth $80 million more than before (but I now own a stake in you, hrhr). Whether the investor values the "before" at or above $120 million is subjective and a different matter entirely.

They don't add the amount of the theft to the valuation. If you convert their debt to you (BFX tokens) into equity, then their liabilities decrease by the amount of debt you convert, and in turn net assets increase by the same amount.
