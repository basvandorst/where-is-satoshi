I have seen this before but had questions. If you know these things that is. Is it easy to set up? How does this work? Do you need somebody to program it or it comes ready out of the box?

Cash in person with local bitcoins.

But I can turn 1 bitcoin into 100 bitcoin in 1 day. The website told me that.
Funny story that has to do with this. There is a guy with this scheme on Dream named BitcoinThief. They just exit scammed and moved everyone to WallStreet (idiots believe it is a different company) and now the same "vendor" his name is now BitcoinMillionaire. I love the irony and how these people fall for it everytime. The exact reason why people are still getting fucked by the dollar.

I wonder if this is the Dread team scamming with Bitcoin fake shirts also. They will do anything for bitcoin over there. As long as it is stealing.
