Yup, it happens - took our order close to 6 weeks.
Additionally - we (re)sell these out of California - arrives in 2 days :D and we're cheaper than direct.

They would - Coinbase is basically a bank. 
After being a customer of theirs for almost 2 years now, on a personal and business level, as of yesterday have requested they close every single account of mine tied to them. They are a bank, easy as that. Holding funds, closing accounts etc. Meh, was such a supporter of theirs for so long. Now I recommend going with another company.

A few things:
* You will not earn bitcoin with mining on your computer
* I do suggest playing around to learn the PC-side of mining - but again, do not leave your PC on 24/7 mining away after you've understood how to setup/config etc.
* * With that said:
* Make sure you're downloading an official and latest release
* Google: how to setup/configure cgminer
Now, if all else fails due to lack of computer knowledge- mine on BitMinter - they have their own Javascript mining software. That means, you create an account on their site/pool and when you login you can click "Start Mining" and another window will pop-up and detect your hardware on your PC and gets you started easily.
Good luck!

I just grabbed the first link on YouTube [here]( but go ahead and search around there. Literally watch people configure their cgminer in different ways to get a better understanding.
Also, try those other subreddits out and then lastly, if you haven't already, create an account on bitcointalk.org and check out the noobie and mining sections.
