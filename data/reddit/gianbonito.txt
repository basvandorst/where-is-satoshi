First, yes, its totally not advertised at all. Bitcoin has spread in Venezuela by word of mouth. And no, the govt. Does not have any regulation on bitcoin yet. Although it's considered illegal to MINE cryptocurrencies.

People don't trust banks and search for other place to store their money. And, as a venezuelan myself, bitcoin has been popular in the country for years.

Which wallet do you recommend for custom fees

I forgot to add that after buying your bitcoin you should send them to your wallet, the one where you control your private keys.

Two days and eleven hours

Did you try sending a small amount instead?

Sure, don't worry. It happens a lot.

I'm from Venezuela myself, and I've heard about those type of "investments" you're talking about. Those are no more than people trying to steal your money. If you really want to invest in the crypto world do it yourself. A pro is that if you get to manage your portfolio efficiently you'll make more profit than just buying and holding the coins. The only con I see (besides the value of bitcoin reaching zero, which I see very unlikely) is that anxiety that hits when the price drops and you're tempted to sell. It's really frustrating but holding is almost always the best option. 
If you want to get started, create a wallet. I recommend Electrum or Mycelium for bitcoin. Jaxx is really good as well but the last two are more secure. Then, buy bitcoin off an exchange. Before buying you should do a little research on the exchange to see if they are legit or what rating they have. Since you're from outside the US, buying bitcoin is going to be a little tedious but it's not impossible. Check out websites lite localbitcoins or Xapo (I bought from here), although you will have to complete a verification process first before you buy. 
I hope this answer helps you and good luck in your future investments.

Isn't there a mobile app?

Actually your math is wrong, it's $0.00028 per Gh. And that would be $71. 54(~0. 02649 BTC) for the whole year. They charge you in dollars not in btc.

Sorry I just feel proud

Probably you're trying to send the whole thing and you're forgetting to subtract the fee. They tell you what the fee is right before completing the TX. Go back, subtract the fee from your total amount of btc/ltc/eth and then that's the quantity you can send.

In my opinion, BTC will reach the $4000 (or around) and then it will start going down to 1500 in a year more or less. Then it will go back up to $15000. That's just my conclusion from just watching at the pattern it has bees developing since it was just cents.

If I bought at $845 a bitcoin, where do I fit here?
