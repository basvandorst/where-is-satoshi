Speaking of books, have you read Nathaniel Popper's Digital Gold, and if so, do you consider his depiction of the rise and fall of MtGox to be accurate?

Thanks! From memory, the book portrayed Mark as a generally honest but largely incompetent idealist, who failed to pick up on the cues that his venture was headed for disaster, and who made most decisions by himself while keeping his staff and stakeholders in the dark.
You might find this summary superficially accurate, but it doesn't do justice to the extensive narration that the author gives of MtGox's day-to-day history over the course of several chapters, e.g. the episode during which Mark would frantically scan hundreds of QR codes trying to find a user wallet that hadn't been siphoned.
I would recommend reading the book (also available as an audiobook), I found it entertaining, informative and well-written; and I'm sure you will smile at the outsider's perspective to a fascinating story you've lived through from the inside.

Seconded. What made Apple successful and appealing was not that they reduced complexity; a computer and an OS remain incredibly intricate and sophisticated creations, no matter the brand. But it was their ability to hide the complexity to the end user, and make the experience palatable from ages 7 to 77.
We need the same for Bitcoin, and accept that our geeky penchant for understanding the technical intricacies of the blockchain is irrelevant to the masses. Mass adoption will require mass simplification of the end user experience.
