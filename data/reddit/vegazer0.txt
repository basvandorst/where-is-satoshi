People here need to learn how banks work and stop saying they are free. Seriously if you say you have a "free" bank account you need education on what banks do with your money. 
* They should be paying you to open an account with them. They are loaning your cash and giving you SHIT interest that barely combats inflation...ugh

Shill post. This rhetoric is why people think BTC is a ponzi. Seriously there are 80 of these post JUST ON REDDIT. Someone already posted the video of the interview w/Guo 1-2 days ago, it was a shit post then too.

Just a shitty post from a hype site...

It has value because of all the things that make it unique. For example I have no i.d but can still shop online with bitcoin, I can also pay back friends instantly with btc, I'm pretty sure it'll be the same price if not more tomorrow so I keep my savings in btc instead of cash. Perhaps most important is it's completely optional.

It's not a need, but it aids in adoption greatly by easing the transition and transfer from fiat into bitcoin. In the situation I describe there are already intermediaries in the form of Coinbass, Circle, Gemini etc.Unless you earn bitcoin that is how you obtain it. But we still cannot convert cash directly into bitcoin easily. To convert cash into bitcoin quickly and cheap I have to use 2 intermediaries, bank and circle. It's not pleasant (No branch near me, Circle KYC headache).

Before anyone else goes spouting b.s about supply and demand, you should realize that that only works once the demand is higher than the supply, and right now we have PLENTY of supply to go through before demand causes a price hike. People like to think all 16 Million bitcoins are active and being held/used but in fact ~$19Mil is used for trading , a portion are zombie bitcoins, and our user base is incredibly small, so yea supply and demand doesn't count YET.when we get ~20m- 100mil more users supply and demand will come into play.
