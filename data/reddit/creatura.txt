It totally does though - you can afford things to ease your suffering like great food, amazing living spaces, accurate and actually professional mental health care, not to mention lifting the stress of being able to afford basic as well as luxury amenities. A rich man can be sad (or in this case a pathological liar), but his tools to fix that are far greater than that of the poor man

What? That has nothing to do with what we were talking about originally. You basically ignored my response and diverted the subject so you could keep talking about your worldview. You know nothing of the real world, or the things you talk about. I peg you for someone who's done the same thing his whole life but maybe moved near a shitty neighborhood once. Sorting through your limp-wristed diatribe I'll pull out the one point you needed multiple paragraphs to explain and agree with it: you need to overcome your own demons, of your own volition, regardless of who you are or what you've been through. That is true. I'm not responding past this because it's pointless.

Oh jesus. Dude I've lived that life, I've lived in my car, the woods, homeless camps, etc. And it's not all carefree singing buskers... it's meth, alcoholism, and occasionally really emotionally intense bonding experiences that matter, but are born of intense hardship. Yeah, waking up every morning with no one around but the mountains is indescribably peaceful. I'd do it my whole life if we had good enough free healthcare or if I could stay 24 my whole life. But we don't - you need money to effectively live life because getting older makes the natural life really hard. 
Yes, there are a lot of very internally depressed people living in luxury. But they're still better off than every single transient I've ever known or lived with. I'm going to be honest, your post reeks of someone who doesn't know shit about the subject matter. Dying young or contracting crippling conditions/addictions is what happens when you don't address the reality of the society we live in. You need money, because money makes life easier.
