I cannot claim to know about Japanese bankruptcy, but I believe that any decision on whether to try to resume operating the exchange with these 'found' coins, or even to distribute these coins pro-rata to owners of GoxBTC, would be subject to approval of the bankruptcy trustee.
Unfortunately, this typically means that there are going to be lots of legal fees taken off the top first. Bankruptcy trustees are generally lawyers, and they tend to take care of themselves first. [I apologize in advance to any lawyers out there who are offended by my generalization here]

I can see encouraging merchants by plugging Michael's 'sharp intuition', but I fail to see how this video encourages "the masses". Assuming you're able to non-verbally communicate from across the restaurant that you want to pay with bitcoin, it saves a step vs. credit card or cash (with change), but that seems like a bit of a long shot. And no other benefit is presented for the consumer...
This is an ad for bitxatm. Don't confuse it with an ad for bitcoin.

Thanks for the info. I didn't realize that these services allowed merchants to lock in the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.
I suppose I could make an argument that I'd still worry about people who decide to accept bitcoins on their own through a wallet, but hopefully anyone sophisticated enough to start doing that can be counted on to be aware of the risks and the option of using bitpay to mitigate the fluctuation risk.
Thanks for the helpful responses guys.
