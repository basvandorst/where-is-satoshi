I know enough about trading to open up shorts once we went below the meme triangle.  Lol we were all sitting in the sidelines waiting for this day and it is BEAUTIFUL. Don't get me wrong I would have longed if things went the other way.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:00:57
OOOOOFFF. We are going down again. My short is loving this!

Even all the big pleb youtubers like Pewdiepie, H3H3, Leafy, Idubbz, and Philip Defranco made vidoes about Bitcoin during December. It's over, last year was the big one. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:48:35
Should I close my position now? I've made a lot of money today!!! I don't wan to get too greedy. What do you thing friend? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:24:55
Been waiting and saving money since January  for this.  I can't wait to buy 10 bitcoins when the price reaches 1k :)
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:46:44
Just turn the graph upside down this December. It will feel like December 2017�� ��������
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:01:01
Not too good :(. At least I more than tripled my money shorting bitcoin and eth. Lol my shorts are getting filled as I type. Yay!
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:20:54
This isn't 2011. Bitcoin went mainstream last year. All the new investors got burned and will never come back. Back in 2011-2013 hardly anybody knew what crypto was. Just look at the market cap. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:16:27
(X) Doubt
Institutional investors like Goldman Sachs are bailing and realizing they don't want to put money in a manipulated pyramid scheme,  Craig Wright has billions worth of Btc and is in a vendetta to crash btc to the ground, Gox still has the coins they are dying to liquidate, even miners are starting to bail. It's only a matter of time before it all collapses.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:42:39
WOWZA!!! YUPPIE!!! DID YOU SEE THAT DROP?!?!? I wonder if we'll see 1k by Christmas December!!
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:18:28

@_date: 2018-11-25 06:59:44
