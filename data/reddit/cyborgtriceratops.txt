When I say 6 down, I mean a password that might be some combination of '6yhn' with or without capitals (but all of them being capitals) in sets of 4. For instance, 6yhn^YHN6yhn^YHN or ^YHN^YHN6yhn6yhn.
If I wanted to brute force it (which I don't) then I'd use 16+ %1,9a correct?

I've seen 4 people say HODL. What does it mean?

No, stupid formatting.
It is just me starting from the number 6 and going down in Y, H, N. From there, you hold shift and repeat.
Its a password that meets most complexity requirements, but since then I've moved on to better ones.

I think I posted it. I just dont have much experience with Python, so im trying to get it to work.

Let me ask a few questions at work, and then I'll hit you up. I've never worked with Python before, so that's my only hold up.

I got it going, but now I'm running into the issue of how to properly set the password list.
For instance, if my password was '6yhn^YHN6yhn^YHN' or '$RFV5tgb^YHN7ujm' or some combination of 6-down, 7-down caps or uncaps, how should I do that?

So, here's the thing about that. When I originally started trying to find this, back 5 or so years ago, I sent him the first wallet and he stopped responding to me, never cracked it, or anything. Granted, it currently doesn't look like he stole the wallet contents, but I am 3 years behind, and him just dissapearing on me without offering any updates when I asked, makes me think he scammed me.
