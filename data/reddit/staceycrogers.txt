Dont check, if you are in long term checking even once a week is enough.. otherwise we have only two options: 
1. You cant understand that investemt takes sometimes years to make some good profits.
2. You are not enough self-confident and you are checking not the price, but you are checking if you were right when you invested in btc...

just to make it clear, this is neither a TA nor FA ... it's just an empirical analysis !! I will make this clear because I respect the both technical and fundamental analysis a lot.

What made you think Bitcoin wouldn't revive again? It repeats the cycle over and over 5 steps forward and 2 steps back. You can either buy and hold it for the future or try trading if you think you can make a bit extra.

Futures certenly have something to do with it, whales too. But the greatest influence have the trading BOTS. They can manipulate the price of BTC and all alts on dollar precisely. The people behind these algorithmes are genious and monsters at the same time.

It's the future, it's progress. Every new technology has had its detractors every since someone said that a wooden wheel will wear out and can't last, so someone invented rubber tires, a new technology spawned, then tires needed repair kits and so on.
Have no doubts, cryptocurrency is the future, whatever detractors may say. BTC is still the leader.

it becomes a valid alternative to buy bitcoin on Friday and sell it on Sunday night. Mondays are becoming gloomy for bitcoin.
The patterns keep repeating themselves.
I got 23% up doing this move in the last 3 weeks.
