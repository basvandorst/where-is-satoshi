Politicians, can't live with them. You CAN live without them. 
Stick to something you're good at, I couldn't tell you what that is though.

Yes, that's the plan of action when I mention it to him. The instant conversion to fiat definitely minimizes the risk to basically nothing. 
Probably the biggest pain is handling the accounting aspect of it.

I've always wanted to learn to surf.. Or just lie on the beach and do nothing as a "career".
This guy appears to be doing both, which makes me jealous.

Can't tell if this is sarcasm or not...

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm a big advocate of cryptocurrencies and I think even having the "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sign outside of his store would get some heads turning. 
As far as I can tell, there is really no risk to accepting BTC for him. He's older so he's a bit risk adverse and I doubt he'd want to hold on to all (or even some) of the Bitcoin, but the adoption would be an interesting experiment.

Hmmm, I suppose the same could be said for an altcoin, using the BTC as "fiat" in that case.

I love Dogecoin, I've mined/purchased a fair share of them. But I don't like the bit of friction that's going on between Doge and Bitcoin. Part of it is the Dogecoin community being the Dogecoin community and part of it the Bitcoin community being the Bitcoin community. 
I respect and admire the initial adopters of BTC, who have started the entire cryptocurrency industry. I've fanatically listed to podcasts from Andreas Antonopoulo and others to get better insight into how things function. 
Dogecoin isn't replacing BTC anytime soon (or ever for that matter), but it could have found a little niche in the internet's funny money. Which is enjoyable enough for me. Thanks to both communities though.

This is too funny. My little sister texted me and was like "I heard Bitcoins crashed and is DONE!!!!"
She goes to Boston College and that's what her finance professor told her. Education system hard at work.

And just in the interest of disclosure, I don't actually get paid by my Dad for this. I just run his website and Facebook page to help him out and move him out of the Stone Age and into the 21 st century. 
Just doing a little bit of research, I definitely think it would be worth his time to accept BTC. My main worry at this point is that he wouldn't have the technical capability to run the PoS... Although, if you can run a credit card system, I see no reason why you would be incapable of running a Bitcoin PoS system right?

Good thing Lawskey is here to protect us all against money laundering.. Because big banks don't do that on a scale 1000x larger.
