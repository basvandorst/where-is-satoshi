A right-winger who confuses educating with brain washing? Doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

When I actually bring up a point your response is "whatever dude"....lol. I use bitcoin to make money, not to support a libertarian world. In the capitalist society that we are living in, I make money in any way that I can, because nothing is guaranteed in the future. And sadly, we need money to even be able to survive.

Just goes to show you haven't a single clue to what communism is, but okay.

There's no use in talking with someone who doesn't know anything about the ideology, so I'll leave now. 
If you ever actually want to learn what it is instead of spouting bs that you've heard about it your whole life, you can go to If you'd like to debate it, this isn't the place for it. That's not what I was trying to do, try for that. 
You seem like you're just a broken record though, going through the motions and saying some of the usual shit that Americans (and/or uninformed people) say about it. I understand, it's hard to look outside your bubble, but if you ever want to, the subs I linked are good places to start. Have a good one!

You do realize every socialist/"communist" state has been sabotaged by the CIA right? I mean look at all the stuff that was in the JFK files that recently leaked, it's absolutely disgusting. 
Also it doesn't intend to be "unicorns and gumdrops". It intends to be fair. There is still work that needs to be done, it's not just a magic society where everything is amazing. I never said that.
