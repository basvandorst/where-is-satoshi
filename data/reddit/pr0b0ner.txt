You are delusional. Explain to me why people are transferring their wealth to Bitcoin.

Oh god...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:39:16
You made the right choice... get it while you can.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:47
You've already sold off your bitcoin right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:38
Which is exactly why Bitcoin will fail...

Oh my god thank you for this post! I feel like no one in the sub is willing to see or at the very least admit this. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:44:18
cool. So none of this matters, as they're not saving any money. what's your point? That because Bitcoing is deflationary they can save it an have more money in the future? Agreed. That's why it's TERRIBLE as a currency. Which brings us back to the entire point.

Haha ok. The idea of companies accepting it as legal tender has nothing to do with it... the point is, why would you spend "currency" today if you know it will be worth more tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:20:18
THIS THIS 1 Million percent this. This is the issue no one seems to understand. It is currently succeeding as an investment, not as a currency...

Do you know the poor? There is no savings. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:29
So people will spend Bitcoin as a currency because it exists as a currency? If I make Schrute bucks, will you spend them because they're a currency? Exactly.
Someone spent 10,000 Bitcoins to buy pizza because at the time they were worth fucking nothing. Would someone today spend 10,000 Bitcoins to buy pizza? Would you, assuming you have purchased Bitcoin, use it to buy anything today? Exactly.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:54:34
This is bullshit. None of this addresses my point. Currency needs to be spent. You don't spend something that will be worth more tomorrow than it is today. At what point are people using Bitcoin to pay for things? Wheres the inflection point?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:17:11
Oh wow. You're a charlatan. It's one thing to be open about the potential benefits of Bitcoin. It's entirely the other to try to claim that these definite detrimental points are positive. This is highly concerning. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:28:00
This argument makes literally no sense. Your suggestion is that eventually people will have to sell it to pay their bills? So the assumption here is that Bitcoin preys on the poor?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:51:27
You are looking at this wrong. All currencies are deflationary... because you want people to spend them. It doesn't, "just so happen" that currencies go down in value... its the whole fucking point! Of course they change. My point is that Bitcoin isn't a currency, because no one in their right mind is spending it right now (unless they're selling it for 100x what they bought it for 3 years ago).
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:20
Absolutely. The first 2 sentences are basically nonsense. It's an argument that basically just insists upon itself; "I'm awesome because I say that I'm awesome, and that means I'm awesome."
Second paragraph says that Bitcoin is going to go up in price because it has gone up in price... so logically it will go up in price. The first thing ANYONE learns about investment is that past results do not indicate future performance. 
Claiming that it is like email in the 90's, is a false analogy. Email in the 90's has obviously become wildly successful. Bitcoin has not. If anything, they're just pointing out that governments have tried to ban it as a "currency", which is not a positive.
The thing that really pissed me off, however, is that they referred to it as a deflationary currency, as if that is a positive thing. The fact that it's deflationary is what makes it so terrible as a currency. By definition, currency needs to be spent. A dollar isn't a dollar if no one will spend it. People spend dollars because they're inflationary, meaning they'll be worth more tomorrow than they are today. 
No one buys Bitcoin so they can more easily purchase things; they buy Bitcoin because they think it will go up in price. But THAT, is an investment... not a currency. Currencies are spent, investments are saved. If Bitcoin isn't a currency, then what is it worth? Nothing.
