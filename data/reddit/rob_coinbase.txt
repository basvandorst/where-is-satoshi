Great question.  The [blockchain graveyard]( already has too many entries caused by datacenter breaches, hosting partners or extremely suspect access.  It’s something we’ve put a lot of thought into.
Where best practices are furthest behind are in protecting from single points of failure.  In a world where servers can store *pure value* in the form of digital currency it’s simply not acceptable for any single person to have direct access to those funds.  Here are some of the best practices we’ve been developing:
* **Datacenters** Datacenters deal with physical, control plane and logical access to either bare metal or VMs.  If your datacenter has any single staffers that can directly access a significant amount of funds through any of those channels, you’re going to have a bad time.  It’s unfortunately hard for small providers to solve this without a big or bureaucratic staff.  We run on a bigger provider (AWS) and work closely with their security team to use their services in such a way that we’re confident no single insider could access the funds we have online.
* **Surface Area** Reduce the surface area of your key material so it never touches areas that individual staff could access.  Don’t run multi-tenant, disable memory swapping and encrypt anything in-transit or at-rest that leaves your trusted zone. 
* **Consensus** Where key material can be accessed, protect with consensus.  We rely on multiparty crypto like shamirs to ensure that no single person can access our key material or the systems that touch it.
* **Sign** Every request, piece of code or update that enters the trusted zone must be audited and cryptographically signed or verified.  SHA2 or Docker Notary are your friends here.
* **Crypto Solutions** We’re looking forward to the next steps of homomorphic operations and expanded secure enclaves like Intel’s SGX that will protect code, operations and data from insiders and admins.

Yes, approx $40k USD of ETC was replay attacked against us that we've since fully recovered for our customers.  We assumed the smaller fork would quickly fade and we were wrong.  After seeing ETC gain traction we worked through the weekend to split all future ETH moving through our systems.  Withdraw based limits and our hot/cold separation protected us from a bigger attack.  
Securing new crypto systems brings new challenges and we invest in redundant systems with overlap like ^ to protect your assets outside of ice cold storage.  This was one of the most interesting public replay attacks that I've seen and a good example of the creative side of security that can be so exciting.

We defend against threats at many levels that are designed to overlap through the idea of defense in depth.  Any one defense might miss an attack, but together they form a tough glue to mess with.  At the simplest layer, looking at requests over the past week we've blocked or defended against:
* 27,664,876 volumetric requests through a variety of DOSs
* 564,589 more complex anomalous requests
* 1,403,397 requests through other security services
* 38,350 failed JavaScript challenges
* 3,624 failed user captchas.
We monitor these through an escalating series notifications, warning, alerts and dashboards designed to optimize our situational awareness and identify anomalies across our environment.
