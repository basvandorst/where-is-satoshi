Yeah. I guess theoretically someone could spy on those services, or hack/compel them to give records of where they got the tx. I assume the tx data goes over HTTPS though, so it's hard to spy on.

Have those coins moved much though? I honestly haven't kept up to date, so I'm asking, but I wonder if the thieves will be too scared to spend it because Bitcoin is not anonymous enough.

It might be too late even for the NSA. If you had hundreds of nodes all over the world logging precise timestamps of when they saw transactions, which IP they saw it from, etc., you could make a better guess of who originated the transaction. But, did the NSA/CIA/FBI have such a network at the time of Mt. Gox, or even now?
Or, in the case of Gox malleability, I guess Gox themselves originated the transactions. (Edit: nevermind, I guess someone else re-broadcasted the malleated ones, so that could have leaked evidence to the P2P network.) All the data they have is probably just IP addresses, which could just lead to Tor or something, which again requires a big network of nodes doing traffic analysis that can retroactively be queried for something as low-profile as sending a few small HTTP requests. I'm not sure even the NSA can quite do that.
I think the best way to catch them is when they spend it, which is why I wondered above if they have or will dare to spend it.

I figured someone would double-take. I think that was this account's first point in even funnier that it was Gox-related.
