no banks accounts were involved, she entered a bitcoin address that she made herself on her phone, but I feel like the site probably put something on my computer. I don't know what would be comprimised that's why I'm asking for help. Hoping someone can do some digging and confirm whether or not I should be flipping out. I really don't feel like changing 100 passwords and formatting unless I have to.. aren't there scanners or other ways to find this kinda stuff out? I have been using MSE as an antivirus and normally just browse 2 or 3 sites but I was busy and let her use my computer to keep herself entertained for a bit, assuming (like an idiot) that she would just be using facebook and instagram bullshit the whole time

thanks, but I think by the time a hw wallet gets shipped, I will have gone full panic mode and burned all my electronics (not literally but i'm freaking out right now)

google chrome. 
my wallet has never been linked with this computer, but I don't know what kind of crazy shit hackers are up to these days. i literally have only ever used facebook, reddit and gmail from that computer just because I hate wondering whether I've got my ass covered or not. I don't even know how to configure a damn firewall ffs :( Internet/computers/tv/technology has never been my thing. I like cars and friends and dogs and inventing stupid things haha. always been that way. but now I also like cryptocurrencies

Thanks so much. I will watch for your reply. I believe she installed it from google search because she couldnt find firefox or brave

that's what I've always used, and trusted, but something has me feeling really uneasy about all this. Thank you, though.

I put a space in the address [this]( is what the site looks like

thank you.

but the only information it asks for is email address and a newly created bitcoin address.. would obtaining an email address be worth setting all that up? someone spent at least a little time on building that site, I feel there has to be a purpose behind it.. Is there anything you suggest I do to see if anything has been compromised? 
thanks by the way, you calmed my nerves ever so slightly.. still feeling uncomfortable, though
