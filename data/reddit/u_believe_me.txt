would you mind explaining how to do this. Lets say I have right now 2 factor authenticator on coinbase. CAn I also have a back up wallet?

I think I want to use  they have the lowest price. While bitstamp is over 700.

so would a safe bet be to, have my private key on an external usb drive. And then true crypt this usb drive so it locks my private key away? 
and once you import your private key to blockchain.info. It shows all your  bitcoins lets say you have 100. I spend like 10. it goes to 90. And then my private key just shows 90 coins? Do I have to re-export? from blockchain

when I try to make the purchase on coinbase. It says wait for your first purchase to finish then we can let the others go through.

I am in the USA, does that make a difference? I have coinbase right now. If I bought from bitstamp or mtgox I can just store it in my coinbase?

really its not scary to cash deposit in someone's account? What if they dont give you the coins. I don't think the bank can get your money back
