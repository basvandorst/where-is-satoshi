so in order to receive payments via Lightning Network I must be continuously online?
Let's say I'm a web developer/designer and I invoice a client.
Do I have to arrange a certain time so we can be both online to make the payment?

From an economic perspective: Why does **receiving** require capacity?
Do I need to have money for you to send me regular Bitcoins?
A channel with a capacity of 100 Satoshis can just receive &lt;= 100 Satoshis.
This means I need to have money to receive money.
Try to explain that to regular people ... "Yea, this new technology is really cool .. let me pay your $800 invoice  with it .. But first you need to fund your account with more than $800 so you can actually receive it" .. WTF!
Or the counterparty (sender) makes an on-chain transaction to establish a new channel (but then again I would have to turn my firewall off so he can connect to my node).
Which incurs transaction fees and takes time (3 confirmations needed to establish a channel, so 30+ minutes if network is uncongested) ... 
These things MAY change in the future .. but right now that's the dire reality


Please define "the rest".
Do you mean every single node?
Or just the highly centralized hubs?
Please be more precise with your conditions ...

Given that you fund it with enough money to last for 100s of transactions
You may argue that there are "Channel Factories" .. which are magically funded via something something ... or .. wait a moment .. we still need on-chain to fund these factories.
I have actually tried Lightning Network and I invite everybody to do the same.
Contrary to popular belief, the software is READY .. it's just that the architecture is broken!
* Play around with lnd, c-lightning or eclair desktop.
* Try paying Starblocks, Yalls and all the other sites.
* Try receiving money.
* Try receiving money when you are offline.
* Try receiving money when you are behind a router/firewall or on a 3G/LTE network that blocks incoming connections. This applies to most people on the Internet today.
* Try paying somebody while NOT being connected to a big (centralized) node.
* Try tracking down a problem when something fails to work.
* Avoid Eclair Android wallet as it's closed-source and has hardcoded routes to the biggest LN node (endurance.acinq.co) .. This one actually works .. but it's all smoke and mirrors
Let me know how it goes ...
In fact, I will offer you 0.1 BTC if you successfully pay me 1 Satoshi via the Lightning network ... PM me and I send you the Lightning invoice (expiry in 3 days) and proof of funds

It says this on the website. Thanks for pointing out that I have to read OTHER websites to know that it's actually custodial ...
From the wallets you showed Zap is the wallet that will give you the REALEST Lightning experience
* It requires syncing to the Lightning network (about 10-20 minutes)
* It requires finding and adding a peer to open a channel with
* It requires an on-chain transaction to fund the channel
* It requires waiting for the transaction to confirm (30 minutes)
* It requires hoping that the peer won't go offline
* It requires luck to have a route to the destination you want to pay

HTLC.me is NOT an actual Lightning wallet
Did you realize how quickly your wallet is ready and funded?
How does that happen?
It's a frontend to one big wallet that appears as individual wallets. 
You are using THEIR own hot wallet, not your own.
It's a custodial Lightning wallet.
You can easily verify this claim by creating two different (pseudo) "wallets" in different browser sessions.
Click on "Receive" on each and generate a Payment request.
Then use `lncli decodepayreq` to obtain the actual destination node.
It's always the same node:
Running on `45.63.87.131:9735`
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:35:27
follow up when asking the `lnd` dev team about it:








So I have to connect to a single node (alias: endurance) to be able to connect to starblocks?

How does the money magically go into Channel factories?
You either convert fiat into LN money (through an exchange).
Or you convert Bitcoin into LN money (via an on-chain transaction that has fees).
Since you have done your research, please explain that part to me ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:04:26
I wonder if anybody has actually tried using  
Here is my experience on testnet3
* I wanted to buy a coffee via the Starblocks demo shop by acinq
* I used `lnd` with `neutrino` (SPV wallet for lightning) and `autopilot`
* Autopilot failed to open any channels
* Lightning failed to give me any suggestions to which peer I could open a channel with
* I had to manually pick a peer and open a channel with the peer (`lncli openchannel`)
* It had to wait for 3 confirmations (~ 30+ minutes on mainnet) until the channel was opened
* Once the channel was opened I tried `lncli payinvoice` to settle the invoice
* It failed with the following error: `payment_error: "unable to find a path to destination"`
* I now have to open another channel and can only hope that this time there is a path to destination
How the heck can this work on mainnet when I have to pay $30 for each open and close channel transaction?
I'm open for feedback and suggestions on how to solve this more elegantly .. 
I can only hope that may have missed something
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:35:31
It appears to be "just working" ...
It's a fake pseudo, custodial wallet .. They have your money, not you ...
The `lncli decodepayreq` is currently the only way to decode a Lightning pay request that I'm aware of.
Somebody should make a website for it ...

The architecture of LN has been compared to TCP/IP.
It's celebrated as a unicast transaction for money.
An intelligent observer will quickly notice that this is a major FLAW.
It requires both parties to be online at the same time and I already outlined the negative side-effects of this.
Not to mention the reduced security (i.e. a hacker attack on a large payment hub)
 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:19:47
So you first open a payment channel with TorGuard paying an on-chain fee and then make the actual payment through Lightning? 
Ok ...
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:31:11
About 35% of the nodes on lnmainnet.gaben are offline nodes.
Just like the website itself ;)
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:30:11


Wrong. If you observe the lnd log output, you will see lots of channel updates and other announcements.
As the project scales so will the quantity of these announcements. A centralized routing service may prevent that, otherwise it's more likely that the system will DDoS itself.

What proof is supplied for this claim?

"Don't trust. Verify"
If the establishment says that Wright is a known conman.
It must be true.

Did you manage to pay for the Blockaccino?
Last time I checked only the ECLAIR android wallet could pay to it via a hardcoded route through the endurance node from ACINQ.
Were you able to accomplish your mission?
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:46:45
The title should be:
**Someone just tipped me 0.00000000000 BTC using LN. This is insane**
Once you close the channel - that's what you would actually receive (after rounding).
Satoshi is the smallest unit of account on the blockchain.
You can't **SETTLE** smaller units.
This is a trick and clearly shows the IOU nature of LN.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:04:43


No, its' not simple.
Mobile wallets on 3G / LTE are behind an ISP based firewall. Mobile data providers generally allow NO incoming connections at all.
Try and check if you can receive incoming connections on your phone while connected with mobile data.
Depending on the phone, even on WiFi a system wide firewall may block incoming connections.
Since LN is a unicast protocol: How are you going to accept incoming connections if all ports are closed?
Duh ...

If you open a channel with a LN peer you must ensure that the peer remains online otherwise your channel is "offline" and can't be used for payments.
That involves a certain trust that:
- the peer is in it for the long run
- the peer is not a home user that goes offline regularly
You can be sure of that only if you use a LN hub.
Ask yourself: With whom do you have your LN channels open?
