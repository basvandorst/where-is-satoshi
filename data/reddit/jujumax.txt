Here from Argentina, I am interested in your idea I think there is a good opportunity in Wine area for several reasons.

Sometimes is good to go back and review where we started and the original motivation, in my opinion at some point egos become too big.

Every 2 weeks Core supporters launch a new and even more weird idea to find a way to activate SW, last 2 UASF and POW change, anxious to see the next one.

Is clear Pieter, Gregory, Luke-jr and Adam are smart, talented and brillant people. Having said that their skills does not make them oracles and people with less experience and technical skills may have a better vision on how to take Bitcoin to next level. Bitcoin need them on board.

About privacy, many people is exploring fungibility options. The problems with Coinbase and Circle will not be solved with encrypted traffic in fact will lead to identify connections and users so they might be forced to connect their nodes to "known" peers where the open decentralized network is totally lost at least for US-EU users that needs to use exchanges. There are 20+ wallets that has a nice implementation of HD is a waste of resources to do the same in Core to solve a problem that is already solved 20 times. I think at some point a HF will be necessary so is not bad to start considering all the changes that will be nice to include now.

I agree, HF may be necessary at some point in my opinion, but for sure there are other options so there is no guarantee about the HF event.
