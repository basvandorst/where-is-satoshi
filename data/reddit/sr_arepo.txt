only one lesson: IF YOU ARE NOT THE SOLE CONTROLLER OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY(S), YOU DO NOT OWN ANY BITCOINS.

beware the Bitcoin Foundation. they do not represent us, nor our interests. they are the 1% of the bitcoin economy...

this is a double top formation. we will not see a new ATH for some time.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:54:12
did this get sorted out? this should never happen, and is definitely not internal. i highly suspect an error in the site's interface, not the blockchain itself.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:16:43
this is a pretty damn good idea, and has been talked about for awhile. P2P exchange(s)!
if anyone can work towards this, it will be positive leaps for bitcoin.
also, just stop using MtGox, everyone. okay?

beware of the investor emotion cycle...
remember it's most profitable to be slightly *ahead* of the curve.

i come from bitcointalk. general consensus (best guess) is an attempted DDoS by a bot.
it was successful for about 15 minutes, bringing goxlag to a whopping 10min before it is assumed that gox determined and blocked the source.

think of it this way: the coins are not actually contained in wallets, they live in the blockchain. the blockchain 'keeps track' of whose coins are whose by verifying the keys that sign off on them as they are transacted. this way, when the protocol asks "which transaction was this coin last involved in?", if it was a tx to B, then it is sure B owns it. if the coin had been part of any of the txs 101-151, B's key wouldn't have been the last to sign it.

im not so sure about the foundation

bubble popped, but value isn't going to go down to 0. loads of strong hands are ready to buy in the single digits.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:09:07
it seems intuitive enough to me. instead of traversing the blockchain and looking inside addresses, it treats the bitcoins themselves as if they were objects being passed off, securely, from one person to another. only coins on the move (coins that are part of transactions) need to be looked at.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:02:11
lol at the person(s) who downvoted me. very few profit from instability. and hint: it's *not* the people who downvote contrary opinion and live inside their optimism bubble. these are the people who line the others' pockets in the case of the other kind of bubble :P

difficulty pretty much always follows price, by protocol design, and overall, it is very nearly perfectly exponential, which seems intuitive, so i'm not quite sure of your claim of a decoupling.
and even if we reach $200 within 2 months (it looks like we could brush it, at least, much sooner), my claim was merely that we will not reach an ATH in that same short time-frame.
the formation looks to me like a double-top. we will test the upper resistances of the previous price spike, and then fail to breach the ATH. this will cause a short-term bust of investor confidence, and the price will correct back to its natural curve, forming another consolidation pattern like the one after the April spike, around the equilibrium price.
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:44:17
us is the entire Bitcoin community, and our motives are your motives, and my motives, and everyone else's. Bitcoin is decentralized for a reason.
edit: the Bitcoin Foundation should not be allowed to speak on our behalf* -- in the spirit of decentralization, talking points and other details of preparation for this meeting should have been discussed and agreed upon in a consensus-based model on the bitcoin forums, or affected by some other venue of direct democratic process.
edit: *see below qualification
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:23:32
beware of this, and the bitcoin foundation. the project is too valuable for a strong-arm co-op attempt not to be made. this will not be the last time, and it will not be the worst case.

therefore, it is useful as money.
gold is useful for a slew of other things, as well as for money.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:29:42
apologies for the wording. "should not be allowed" isn't quite what i meant. i am just disappointed that the Foundation isn't making fair and equal representation a priority given their current role in Bitcoin politics.
@_date: 2013-04-17 10:30:20
this was reported on the forums too, and seems to be a harmless temporary bug that has now subsided.
however, gox just charged me 4x fees on a single tx and others have been talking about recent fund mismanagement as well. the moral of the story is JUST STOP USING GOX. please.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:11:39
oh yes, sorry. i've got my head in my technical analysis :P
it has yet to be shown that difficulty can predict price in any significant way. the two are obviously related, but it seems as though difficulty is a lagging indicator of price and is relatively useless to determine future price points, though it can be used to gauge various characteristics of the market *right now*.
i'm curious though, what conclusions about future price movement have you drawn from difficulty data?
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:36:52


us *is* everyone -- that's the point. and when only a few special interests are considered, that is, when non-democratic processes control policy, bad stuff happens. i know everyone else's interests are varied and ungroupable and this is the point! these diverse interests need representation -- do you think the Bitcoin Foundation has them in mind? even if they are benevolent, they are not creative enough to think about all of the ways in which bitcoin is being used. all of these voices ought to be taken into account by policy makers.
i am not trying to speak for anyone, i am simply playing Revere. the Bitcoin Foundation is trying to speak for us.
and don't even bother with your guilt by association with the Occupy movement. please just listen to what i'm trying to say.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:58:34
here's a tip. if you don't like how MtGox handles your money, don't give them any.
remember, this is the bitcoin world. vote with your feet.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:51:49
HERE HERE. x-sentiment from bitcointalk.
triple digit prices are NOT sustainable for the underlying bitcoin infrastructure. not only is the market for goods small compared to the 'financial sector' (exchanges, brokers, etc), the financial sector itself cannot handle the load of currency trades (see ongoing MTGOX meltdown).
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:05:38
the downward slope seen in 2011 is missing and is replaced by horizontal consolidation. this is not a detail to be overlooked.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:12:20
LTC just had their own mini-bubble if you look at the charts. Volatility is incredibly high.
its price skyrocketed 600% in three days, then collapsed 75% in the next four. that started April 2. i wouldn't look at it as an investment right now.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:06:28
any other exchange. period.
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:08:58
"Thus, in the long run you still lose more than you win, but it's an interesting approach."
this is the most important thing here. to anyone attempting the martingale strategy -- any strategy that bets on 50% will only achieve 50%, no more. martingale strategies merely modulate *risk* and *magnitude of a single loss*
in other words, the risk of losing in a 50% is quite high. playing the martingale, you can reduce the risk of losing to an impressive 99.999% or so, but the 0.0001% of the time you *do* lose (small risk), you lose in proportion (enormous loss).
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:05:20
haha this seems like a pretty good idea, and must also be quite entertaining.
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:17:21
this, among perhaps other motives that we shall not know. they are in a position to influence public opinion &amp; government policy. they are very, very rich in bitcoin. how are they any different than the other millionaires who are in charge of general policy? our congressmen want a strong economy, but they want more than that.
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:47:33
look, this meeting will shape policy. that policy will affect every one of us. the Bitcoin Foundation is leveraging its eminence (read: wealth) to be the ones attendant at this meeting. they didn't even poll the community for talking points (that i am aware of? Gavin, I know you're following this thread, can you comment on this?).
@_date: 2013-04-17 10:04:26
short answer -- large volume suggests an end-move -- that is, a reversal... things are looking up for the exchange rate.
it's not definite though, and zero fees definitely helped. that graph is only gox data, not all data.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:07:08
sorry? "diff" charts? do you mean differential? like rate of change of price?
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:38:36
martingale strategies can work to transform expected returns and risk (higher short-term expected returns with larger long-term risk) which is attractive to some gamblers, but it doesn't 'beat the maths'. the true expected return is still slightly negative.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:35:08
i wouldn't call that a price collapse. that was a flash panic, or a large capitulation move, which was quickly corrected-for by market forces. and the obvious answer is that the difficulty algorithm re-adjusts every 2016 blocks and simply did not have enough time to react...
i'm starting to think you're a little unfamiliar with the actual protocol.
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:45:01
i've explained the protocol, yes, but this is entirely different. this is about *legal policy*.
we can't prevent it, and it's a shame, because it's just a bunch of rich investors with special interests shaping policy on the asset with which they're involved. nothing new to see here, you're right.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:46:29
these are called triangle consolidation patterns -- look it up! good eye [ :

keynesian economics is not the be-all, nor the end-all. read up on what the austrian school has to say in response to this admittedly well-articulated point.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:03:50
gold is incredibly overvalued strictly from a 'use value' perspective.
but people do treat them like they have arbitrary worth because they have arbitrary scarcity.
bitcoin has scarcity by design. it's a necessary quality for money.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:20:05
i'm a bit late. but no. that's the whole point -- it only has to look at the immediately previous transaction. if you're familiar with a 'linked list', a kind of data structure, it is very similar.
when bitcoins are 'minted' (rewarded to a miner), their signature is special. however, say the miner sends his coins to a separate address. then he wants to send them to his friend. when he transfers the coins,  the protocol simply looks at the previous tx -- the miner to himself -- and verifies that the miner has the coins. the protocol doesn't worry about whether or not that transaction is valid because it *knows* it's a valid tx -- that is, it was verified the same way (the protocol looked at *its* previous tx, which was verified in the same way, and so on and so forth). so the whole blockchain is sort of recursively verified. in a sense it does look all the way to the beginning of the blockchain, just not in each individual confirmation.
another way to think about it is, each new block that's mined verifies the ENTIRE blockchain before it (recursively), PLUS the new block, not just the new block.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:13:30
bitcoin can't be dead simple because then it wouldn't work.
cryptography isn't simple.
your argument boils down to "teaching old people how to use computers is frustrating and impossible -- therefore there's something wrong with computers!"
give it time. people just need to get used to the idea of digital cryptocurrency and all of those things will improve.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:26:31
you seem to have a few misconceptions:
let's first take some assumptions:
(1) the total supply of gold is relatively fixed (i.e., most of the gold that exists has been mined already)
(2) given fixed supply, price is a function of demand (basic economics)
take a look at the [price of gold]( in the past century. i find it hard to believe that the DEMAND for gold amongst its various uses (you listed above) should be increasing at such a rate. the missing variable is SPECULATIVE growth. this is the main driver of the price, as is the case with bitcoin.
also, bitcoin is not 'worthless'. right now one coin is trading at about $100. nothing has inherent worth, no paper money, no precious metal, not bitcoin either. but we assign it worth.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:31:59
this will come with price stability. as it stands, bitcoin is acting more like a store of value (commodity) than a currency.
TYL: "Currency" actual comes from the idea of (money velocity)[ or how quickly the units change hands in a period of time. this is precisely what you measured when you looked at the top wallets!
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:59:29
this guy seems not aware that exchanges like BTCe exist with market-supported exchange rates. bitcoin is money because of this empirical fact, and no amount of economic handwaving can change that.
@_date: 2013-08-27 16:28:53
why is this a closed-door meeting?
