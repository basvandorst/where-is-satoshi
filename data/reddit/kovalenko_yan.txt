Of course you can start buying it now if you play long.

Very interesting article

It's better to ask their support 
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:26:11
Remember it. Use pass phrases you can remember

And silver also

Great job and good reaction. Good luck

I use it as a store of value and I'm fine with that I and believe that's the best use case for BTC if we are not considering bitcoin blockchain itself 
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:16:42
Gemini exchange, trezor or keepkey wallet 
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:43:22
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:31:52
Yeah me too
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:50:00

He didn't deliver. It was EtherDelta which was a working product, then it was an ICO and then we got ForkEtherDelta which is a different project.

Diversification only:
- crypto assets 
- gold and silver 
- real estate 
And of course invest in yourself (healthy, education, family).

Many people have suffered from this scam, which is EtherDelta ICO. There is a Telegram group called EtherDelta Victims. 
We are looking for a lawyer who can help to file fraud and possibly class action lawsuit.

The ICO

It's better to have a portfolio of btc, eth and real estate now. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 00:59:56
I don't know about the fork. EtherDelta did an ICO, raised around $12m if I remember correctly and gone.

I understand what you are saying. Unfortunately I don't see the future without AML and KYC rules in one form or another. I think the best way probably is to support it and develop society with blockchain and crypto currency. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:46:30
Good news 
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:56:23
If we want to scale BTC we should follow AML and KYC rules. If you don't want that, market offers to you a lot of options like ATM, local Bitcoins, etc.
