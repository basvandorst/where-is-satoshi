Coinbases response is, yup we suspend the account and won't tell you why, sorry for any inconvenience.  I know because I got this same email and opened a support ticket only to be told "*Regarding the email itself, I can appreciate that it must be frustrating, and also a bit confusing as well. If I could provide additional information I would, but I’m unfortunately not able to say anything more about the decision.*" so that was a whole lot of help...

Bitcoin is **NOT** anonymous! Each transaction can be traced through the public ledger called *The Blockchain*.  If you are buying Bitcoin through an exchange like Coinbase where they have personally identifiable information about you, then send that money directly to a DNM your transaction **is transparent** and two trained monkeys could track it back to you.  It's no wonder LE came knocking.

I know right,  this is why we can't have nice things.

I got the same email, contacted support and was told:












What does that even mean?  I haven't used the merchant account since late January (*we don't get a ton of Bitcoin sales*) but I know I haven't done anything illegal, and nothing recently to trigger a suspension of the account!
F them!  I went to [BitPay]( and had the account set up in 15 minutes, ready to take Bitcoin again...  Fine if Coinbase doesn't want my fee's I'll give them to someone else...

Not familiar with those acronyms, I'm going to assume they are monetary regulations of some sort. That is the cost of doing business in the USA, business choking, liberty killing legislations. Perhaps Coinbase should consider moving off shore.  One of the main reasons I am such a fan of Bitcoin is because of the decentralization of the currency, it's the last bastion of a *free market* and having to constantly bow to ridiculous politicians can strangle that.

Basically yeah

Yay Government

Same here, no notice and no explanation, I opened a support ticket and was told:








This wreaks of government! I'm wondering if they haven't been put under some gag order &amp; that is why they refuse to say what's going on.  
I had both my personal and business accounts with coinbase, and it sucks because I used to sing their praises. 
These are the pitfalls of doing business under a tyrannical regime like the US government.  My advice for any Bitcoin based company **get out of the U.S.**

I don't like all this cloak and dagger secrecy that is going on around the suspension of these accounts from Coinbase.  When I do business with a company, especially one I hand over banking info to, I expect some level of transparency, or at the very least customer courtesy to tell people why they have arbitrarily suspended a merchant account, with no reason, no explanation and no help.  It's a poor business practice and it turns people off from wanting to do business with them in the future.

I haven't logged the account in months, and mine was suspended too...  that can't be it.  They are being incredibly tight lipped about the reasons for the account suspension. I do find it interesting you said you haven't taken a Bitcoin payment in 6 months, my last payment was January 31st ...

I have tried this, no one buys the item at such a huge discount.  When you post an item on Purse.io for a discount it creates an "ad" that someone else then has to fulfill...  these people buying the items don't touch the large discounts.   I have had over a dozen transactions on Purse and never got more than 30% off ... usually isn't 25%...

Well it was back up, then back down!

I find this thread interesting, I have placed 3 orders in the past few days on Purse ranging from 20% to 30% and as of yet none have been purchased.   In light of the recent hacks I am wondering if people are staying off Purse?  I have made many buys over the past couple of months and have never had to wait more than  a few hours to get a item purchased.   Any one else having this problem?
