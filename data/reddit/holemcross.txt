I'm referring to bringing unwanted attention to yourself. It's a proven phenomenon with people who come into large amounts of money either through inheritance or the lottery. People come out of the wood work asking for loans or 'investments in business opportunities.' There was also the recent story of the loud mouth Bitcoiner that got kidnapped and extorted. People will do really crazy things when large amounts of money are involved.

It's nice that you can trust your friends. However, friends of friends, and other sorts might not be as trusting. Many of the crypto gainers here come from all walks of life and don't all have financial savvy. It's best to keep yourself safe and head low when it comes to challenging the greed of others.

I'm glad to see a counter opinion to reflect on. I too am a big proponent of open information and the power it provides and the good it can do. However, seeing it in the light James has shown provides the drawbacks it has in particular situations.
  
This isn't like bitcoin where we can trust numbers, it's a system of people doing people things. And while people are making the decisions, allowing them to perform their assigned duty with the low space for intimidation and fraud seems to be a better solution than the current.

The most one can do is watch the flow of the coins and follow what addresses they go to. You can hope that maybe they would go to an identifiable address, but odds are likely they would use a mixer or toss it onto an exchange first.

Good point. I think that where we differ in opinion is what our imagined ideal of what Bitcoin will become. As you mentioned, you expect Bitcoin to fulfill a black market role or maybe something along the lines of a grey market.
  
I believe that Bitcoin can succeed in this way, but I'm hoping for a more open, accepted version of Bitcoin. Where official business can utilize it because it is the superior option and common people can utilize it without fear of repercussions from their government.
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:10:15
And this is okay. The idea of bitcoin the currency is not to eliminate poverty, it's to create an decentralized ledger with easy of access to all users with an internet connection. Poverty wasn't solved with the invention of railroads. Early investors that succeeded made bank and poor people stayed poor. But poor people's lives were improved due to the greater mobility of resources to their towns and eventually costs were brought down that they could use trains themselves.
  
If Bitcoin succeeds, us early people will benefit greatly as early investors, and the public and poor will gain the benefit of a better system over the current one.

Hard to say. I'm a long holder, so my strategy has been to keep and increase my BTC holdings when I can. Any decision you make here has a risk. The safest would be to divest your BTC if you are afraid of additional immediate slippage, and need to utilize that value, but the price can just as well reverse and you lose potential gains.  
Not an easy choice but this is the craziness of BTC. Good luck!

This reminds me of the discussion of "how much are you worth?" As in, at what price are you willing to throw pride and self dignity for a million dollars. 
  
You will find that amongst your friends, you might not readily do something like suck a rando's dick for a few hundred grand, but some one would. And another would go lower, and another much, much lower. A race to the bottom. Just cause you are willing to claim a BTC is worth so much, in the grand scheme of things the population at large values it much less.

I find this really curious that people prefer to use the tip bots oppose to what you've described. Maybe it's ease of use, but I think it has more to do with the social aspect and publicly announcing of tipping that makes it more popular.

People have plenty trust in BTC. Only thing that will break that is a fatal flaw is found in the protocol which has yet to happen sufficiently. The market right now is playing around with risk and some people are making bank watching the prices fall.
  
Unfortunately, an environment like this is just hostile for regular consumers such as yourself. Id' suggest trying to either wait for the bottom to be hit, or accept some potential risk while you double your intended holdings that way you can spend BTC immediately and buy back while expecting the delay.

You can always buy less than a whole coin. The way I look at it, I expect over time for the value to increase, so any amount I buy will move by the percentage that changes. If I buy $10 today and bitcoin moves by 10%, then I just gained/lost a dollar. Judge where you think bitcoin can go from here and if you are able to risk your money in the potential gains or losses.

Has to do with market friction. It takes many transactions to keep prices on track with one another across exchanges. The arbitrage opportunities that open up are often filled by people with the best means. Sometimes there are restrictions on people getting either fiat or coins to particular exchanges. All sorts of restrictions as well as time delays can compound to grow these gaps. We've seen these in the past and the reasons have ranged quite a bit. I do not know why on this is the case now, but it's fun to look back when there's an answer.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:01:39
I don't think so. People only have so much focus and attention they can give towards any particular thing. If you have a inquisitive mind, you can ask questions that mean something to you. If you get answers, then that's a new place to work from. At some point you may stop asking questions because of lack of time or interest, but you will definitely have learned more in the process.

The risk though is insolvency and collapse of Bitfinex. This is much like how GOX went down with people trying to get out however they can. With USD withdraws still locked out, the only way to get current cash out is by buying the thinning sell orders which are driving the price way up. Until either USD withdraws are reinstated or Bitfinex collapses, I don't see any directional changes. You are free to gamble arbitrage on that site, but no guarantee you are getting out unscathed.

I know what you are saying. My issue with the HODL mentality is the lack of an exit strategy. The true goal of a HODL is do so until bitcoin is accepted in the mainstream. The problem is that while faith is strong in bitcoin, we have to stay vigilant in case other crypto come along and usurp it.
I came close to a time where I needed to convert coin to fiat due to an emergency and it would have been a terrible time to sell. There should be a bit more thought than pure HODL.

Coinbase has a policy that insures your coins which is nice, but it still breaks the spirit of the lessons we are trying to share: You don't truly own your coin unless you have your private keys in only your possession.
