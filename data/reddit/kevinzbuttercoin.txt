Kevin from Buttercoin here.  We will have a full order book and trade-matching engine so users can place market orders as well as limit orders.

Hi, this is Kevin from Buttercoin here.  We are still finalizing what our fees will be after this free trading period but you can be sure they will be competitive with the fees of other marketplaces and exchanges in the bitcoin space.
For limits higher than $5,000 USD per transaction, we allow wires for specific individuals and businesses who have passed our enhanced due diligence.  Send me a PM if this is something you are interested in.

Hey all, this is Kevin from Buttercoin.  Just want to let you all know that since the early days of the project we've rewritten everything in Scala and will be open-sourcing it after we launch.  We also still have all the donations we received and will be using them to fund other bitcoin-related open-source projects.  If any donor would like their bitcoins back, just send us a signed message from the address you used to donate to us.  Thanks and happy trading!

We still have all of the donations we collected from the earlier days of this project and plan to use them to fund bug bounty programs for open-source bitcoin projects in the future.  If any donor wants their donation back, just send us a signed message from the address you sent the donation from and we will send it back.
