You guys have no idea how this works. You all see Intel, hack, cloud and keywords and make assumptions. The chances of someone reading the cache memory within the x86 chip is little to none. In fact, azure just got 100% patched an hour ago, and I assume others are not far away.
So OP is stupid for paying $100 in fees to transfer his coin, then transfer his money to his bank. He's missed out on gains for being dumb.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:57:38
No you are fudding. You just wasted huge amount of your time, and cost yourself profits over nothing.

Because he can create his own coins, pre mine them, then sell them to everyone on facebook. If HE DOESNT do this I'd be surprised.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:43:01
Make your wallets and set a really low fee....sure it will take a few days to confirm, but that won't matter since you'll be giving them at Christmas. Don't let the spike in fees stop you.

I really love this community. I've been involved with computers since the AOL private room days. I've never met such a bunch of dedicated people in my life. The giving in this sub is just unreal. I"ve even done my own little bit of gifting, but when I saw Tether_Is_Fiat sent this man 37 bitcoins, it brought me to tears. What a wonderful thing to do to someone who has dedicated his life to bitcoin, but never got the rewards. Not just Tether_is_Fiat, but each and every one of you that sent a donation. You did it out of love for the game, and we need people like Andreas to keep spreading the word, without sacrificing his life and family. It sure as hell looks like this guy will be able to carry that on for the foreseeable future.

Well I was a little harsh, but I would remove the recommendation that they email a copy of their private key to themselves, or take a picture of it.

I mean not to poop on your parade, but you realize in order for bitcoin to reach 1 million people have to pump in 24 trillion dollars into bitcoin. The GDP of the US is 21 trillion.

I think he's being a little dramatic. Certainly possible in 3-5 years. Big Money is coming, and they will want alot of coins. The market will be manipulated, and we will see some major crashes. But in the end, Bitcoin will be 500k a coin. Hopefully, you all can HODL. I dont know if I can. At some point an amount is life changing.

From another thread: Apparently, there is a Segwit ASCIBOOST hack that they will use to make the difficulty shoot through the roof causing bitcoin to be unusable until the next adjustment.
Operation DragonSlayer will be attempted as follows:
1. miners switch to BTC en masse so that the difficulty shoots through the roof. (They might have some ASCIBOOST trick to make difficulty high)
2. When it adjusts, they switch back to BCH immediately

New users just bought in coinbase and they are hitting refresh. They dont even know what they just bought, let alone wtf the mempool is. They are all sitting around gasping at the money they are making, not transferring in and out of hard wallets.

There have been a lot of people like you complaining. I made a shit post not knowing what would follow. But what did follow was a lot of fun, and a second post making fun of me making it on r/all. This generated close to 20k hits, making it the 4th highest post of all time on this reddit. A TON of people posted in these threads wondering what Cryptocurrency was and how to invest. It sparked a TON of interest which is exactly what BTC needs right now. Lighten up, sometimes funny news and meme's is just the thing to peak someone's interest and push someone over the edge to buy.

I dont see how you all think this is good. This is more manipulation towards BCH.
Think about what would happen if they gave everybody BCH. Most people will sell their BCH making the price drop.
Now they are going to low ball you, keep your BCH. Hoping some of you sell BTC to buy BCH causing the price of BCH to rise. They will then sell your BCH, buy your bitcoins for a cheap price, and the price will rise.
You guys have to realize Bitcoin isnt going anywhere. Make them give you your BCH NOW.

Oh yeah, everyone is going to move their free forked money into a coin that has a downtrend. Or, the right thing will happen, people will sell their B2X and buy even more BTC, making it break 9k. There is no way people are going to hide out in LTC and ETH. This has forked how many times now, and this situation has happened at least twice now? Shitcoins are free money to buy more BTC. Thats it.

I can confirm this. On Nov 19th 11:00 on the Day chart on Kraken I had a stupid low sell limit order for 5400. Kraken market makers took me out when the lowest for the day was around $5900. I was watching the order book and there was a 400btc wall ahead of mine. Suddenly it poofed and popped that candle on the chart.

I think 100k is a pipe dream. MIght see 20k again before another 50% correction and 1 year of bear market before spiking to 50k in 2021. Then another correction to 18k, then a bear market for another year. Maybe by 2025 we will see 100k. But definitely not this year. If I'm wrong, I'll send each of you $1000 who upvotes this comment.

Look at everyone suggesting the silencing of a free fluid community. Just like bitcoin, subreddits and reddits are popular because people are upvoting them.

Depends on if this tether story is real. If its real, what are its motives? Are they printing money to Buy Bitcoin to sell for real money hoping to crash the price? Are they pulling as much fiat into Bitcoin because they know Bitcoin is the next money supply? If its the ladder HODL. If they plan on converting all their purchased BTC to FIAT, well price will drop.

It hurts mass adoption by making it super confusing. The mass majority of ICO's are pre-mined to make the creator rich. They are a total scam.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:04:16
The drop was not because of coinbase. The drop was because people took profits. Coinbase went down because of the massive sell orders and bot api calls. I watched the entire thing live, I never lost access pro.coinbase. I saw every single trade happen right through drop. Traders started to sell, that triggered bots to sell, that triggered stop losses, that triggered human emotions. Its the name of the game, yes coinbase had issues, but it was not the cause.

Bitcoin is trading for $2700 in China right now. I'd get the hell out.

Meeting with a $250 dollar hour lawyer about your $200 in Bitcoin is one of the smarter things I've seen.
Also, nice try pretending you are 60 years old. Not fooling me, "lurker"
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:14:09
You were right, where is it heading now?

The companies who made the miners got smart and only make them for themselves. You want to mine bitcoin? Design the next ASIC.

I want to believe, but reality tells me no.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:57:00
Well, it just broke that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:51:45
I had 100 coins on some hard drive from some emails someone paid me when it was worth 10$. I threw the computer out a few years later not thinking. Somewhere in a landfill is a half a million.

Fixed, but I meant my "stock" of coins.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:55:04
Sold half my coins yesterday. ITs pretty clear its down trending. And will prob downtrend till November.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:46:59
Why would you sell 50%, its going to be worth 10 million in January. It would be so stupid to sell BTC now. Dont hold it, spent it, but replace it.
Bitcoin is not a stock. Its a chunk of moon that's heading home.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:21:52
I Google Bitcoin price
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:44:44
I like this, I'm stealing it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:47:25
Why is it expected to drop? I don't think this fork is going to have as much volatility as before. We all know whats going to happen. Shitcoin will split off, everyone will sell it and bitcoin will continue to rise.

Sure, BTC split in two. Some people think BCH is the new money,but those people are not looking charts. The only reason BCH is worth anything is because coinbase hasn't given access to all their BCH coins. When they do, bch will be worth $10 maybe. You don't create money out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:02:05
More like a 2inch thick propane tank 
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:53:08
Sorry guy, the next 10 min are the best time to buy, it's already climbing and will get over 5k today. This was profit taking and chasing out a bunch of weak hands.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:45:33
Old news, price is $5444
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:37:25
Yeah, aka doesn't listen to a single word he said.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:24:14
Look at the price and tell me whats realistic? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:52:16
Lol this, trezor has support a day later and I made $5000 on BCH. Could not have done that with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:25:08
All you need to know is BTC/XBT is the real chain. Thats it. Use coinbase to buy your Bitcoin. You'll be fine.
The answer to your question however, is Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:26:22
old news
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:22:32
Maybe... I'm not ruling that out. I'm just saying the mental development of a common 6 year old cannot grasp the concept of digital currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:34:47
Its the only news station that has something other than TRUMP.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:38:46
The story had nothing to do with Bitcoin, nor was it even mentioned.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:53:52
Titles like this help the ranking.
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:03:16
A fork my friend. We've already seen a group of people do a 51% attack. They forked off and formed bcash.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:55:22
This subreddit is full of "HODL" and "LAMBOS" and you're calling me black and white? LOL
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:06:58
500k bitcoin in 6 months got it. This isn't a prediction, its a dream.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:12:27
You, and then down to 10k for 2 years, rinse repeat
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:56:39
Ok relax with these posts. We have semi good growth the last few weeks.  People got absolutely wrecked when they bought at 20k
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:04:52
The only way this chart makes sense is if you are trying to convince other people to lose their life savings.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:47:32
I just thought it was straight stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:47:35
You have no idea how any of this works do you? You cant hack etrade and steal shares.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:04:00
I hope anyone with half a brain isnt taking these charts seriously. Look, I've been in bitcoin since 2012. Its got major issues right now with forks. Since the BCH fork, its been a downhill battle. Glad I cashed out. Right now bitcoin is not looking good.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:20:30
The only ridiculous thing here is this chart.
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:50:10
Such an ignorant comment. If France banks fail a lot of people would be hurting. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:46:53
Why because you were too weak to buy at 3k. Hey guys, vitorizzo forgot to buy at the low. Lets roll everything back so he can get in.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:59:41
90% of the chart is 0-$800....the other %10 is 800 -20k. It's designed to make it seem like Bitcoin hasn't dropped. Its Tom foolery.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:50:13
OP waiting for 1k. &lt;insert skeleton pic&gt;

a 4$ swing is hardly volatile
