Agreed; that, I'll upvote. But for a temporary time, it will be traded and have value to those who are ignorant of the fact it's not real bitcoin.

You're delusional. The hard fork has artificially pumped the price of bitcoin to an all time high, it is definitely going to lose value post fork, as a large amount of that value was moved into bitcoin from altcoins in preparation for the fork. The question is only how much it will lose, and for how long.

Why not try giving some specific examples instead of just saying I'm wrong? There's a tweak for just about anything I can think of that I would want to change in iOS and the giant library of apps available for it. What can you do on your phone that I can't on mine, other than flash an inferior OS with no development support?
Edit: why the downvotes? It was a legitimate question, does anyone wanna answer it? I swear I see Android fanboys circlejerking more often than I've ever seen the Apple fanboys that they so often complain about...

Like what? I don't know why anybody would want to flash an OS with no app development other than for very specialized purposes that don't involve using the device as a smartphone...

You can do this on Jailbroken iOS.

Newer (unjailbroken) iOS devices have better overall security features than android phones, and have some really great localized mobile wallets for crypto like breadwallet and loafwallet. Also, I don't know anybody who buys every new version of iPhone that releases.
I agree that it's shitty that phone manufacturers try to lock users out of modifying their phone, but both apple and android manufacturers do this without much success. Companies should work more closely with independent developers to allow the modifications people want to be made without compromising their security features in the first place.

Just read your comment on my jailbroken iPhone 6S... you can do whatever you want with your phone when you jailbreak.

I think it's a bit of an overstatement to say it's very common among normal users. The average person does not modify their smartphone at all. It's definitely easy, but certainly not any easier than jailbreaking. Also, it sounds like the only reason anyone flashes a new Android version for their everyday smartphone is because most Android phones have major problems with bloatware and other crap being installed by the manufacturer, which you won't run into on iOS at all...
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:02:17
Once an app is installed on iOS, it doesn't get removed from the phone just because it is taken off the app store. Apps like breadwallet and loafwallet are great localized crypto wallets that will always be available to iOS users. Also, it's arguably more secure for it to be difficult to install unapproved apps, while on android someone could easily accidentally download a malicious app that ends up draining their crypto wallets. I can't recall Apple ever forcing an update, let alone a malicious one; I think it's good to have a healthy sense of skepticism, but this is just paranoia...

People in this thread are giving good general advice, but right now isn't a great time to buy. Wait until the hardfork dip in November.

Nobody who gets an iPhone would want to use another OS, it defeats the purpose of getting an iPhone in the first place, which is to run iOS and iOS apps. Maybe if android manufacturers didn't ship their phones with spyware and bloatware, nobody would need to flash stock android... nobody feels 'stuck' with jailbroken iOS when you can tweak it to be however you want. Lets see an android reliably run a current version of iOS, then I'll be impressed.

I don't think you understand this situation. Mt Gox had been insolvent for several months, and lied to its users about this the entire time.  They decided to literally gamble that the price of bitcoin would stay low enough for them to buy back the lost coins, despite the massive upward pressure this would obviously create; they lost horribly. This is not a responsible way to save your company from bankruptcy. He should have shut down deposits and withdrawals as soon as he realized there were funds lost in order to minimize the number of users effected. MtGox experienced tremendous growth throughout the time period in which they were insolvent, and as a result ultimately hurt more individuals than if they had been transparent and responsible about fixing their insolvency.

It takes 5 minutes to write up an email announcement regarding lost funds and cc your customer relations department. His company blatantly lied and hid the truth from its users to avoid a run on the exchange. Being overwhelmed with grief in no way prevents you from doing this. You are giving this guy a pass if you think this 'miscommunication' was anything but intentional.

People browsing a cryptocurrency subreddit aren't exactly the most trusting type, I'm not sure why you're assuming that I'm a 'faithful' kind of person. You're implying I'm somehow ignorant of what I'm talking about, with a healthy side of condescension. 
Mt. Gox was NOT a publicly traded company, and had no legal obligation to work in the interest of its shareholders, so I'm not sure what you're on about. In fact, Mt. Gox only had 2 shareholders, which was mentioned by Mark himself in this AMA. 
Obviously a company has an objective motivation to preserve it's existence, that's not exactly a revelation. Mt Gox was very profitable, and Mark would obviously want to save his company. The problem is the way he attempted to do so. Continuing to lie about solvency over a period of months while accepting new deposits until the minute the exchange goes down actually is illegal in certain jurisdictions that Mt Gox was operating under, unlike lying about it to the public.
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:28:43
No, there is nothing 'legit' about defrauding new users to maintain a lie regarding solvency.  In fact, it's illegal in many of the jurisdictions MtGox was operating under, which is why Mark ended up in a Japanese prison and is no longer allowed to leave the country.
You say you don't know what you're talking about, yet you continue to speak. You discredit yourself, yet seem to be defensive about a subject you're ignorant of. I wasn't even involved in this scandal, but the last thing I'm gonna do is let someone defend a fraudster who has no idea what they're talking about.
Mark's intention's are entirely irrelevant to this conversation. He defrauded users the minute he let them deposit funds into an insolvent exchange.

Why did Roger Ver claim to have proof of Mt Gox's solvency when it's impossible for that to be true? You didn't answer his question.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:15:29
That's completely ass-backwards. If they are representing the company, then why do they not have a clue what's going on? If they were aware of the situation, how do you justify their superiors telling them to lie about their solvency to make the company look better? People shouldn't have to expect companies to lie about their solvency.

Personally, if I was going to get those just for fun and to play around with them, I'd probably just get one. I don't see what advantage there would be to having more than one.
