I mean it doesn't make sense why they'd have to do that. Money laundering is about obscuring the *origin* of funds. They know the money is coming from their advertisers. In what way could the end-user be laundering money?
@_date: 2016-08-02 03:50:03
Oh I was thinking they were getting paid in bitcoin from the advertisers, or at least converting it themselves at that phase. Seems more efficient and less intrusive than having each end-user purchase tiny amounts of bitcoins each time they watch an ad.

@_date: 2016-08-02 03:29:05
That can't be right. They know the source of funds. They get the money from the advertisers, not the users. The only people capable of laundering in this case are the advertisers.

Apparently you can mine them yourself on a classical computer, but then you need to take your proof-of-work to a quantum computer for the quantum bitcoin to be minted. That is, if I'm understanding all of this correctly.

Third party websites (or anyone for that matter) can already see every existing address and the amount of bitcoins held at  that address. Bitcoin is an open ledger - anyone can see the contents of any address. In order to move bitcoin from one address to another, you would need to sign a transaction with your Private Key, which should NEVER be shared with anyone.

One key of a 2-of-3 multisig address could be in the person's will. When they die, they are given the key and now they take possession of the bitcoins. Alternatively, you could use an oracle, which would signal to release the key to the third-party if certain conditions are met - like a deceased status from an agreed upon source for x amount of time.
Edit: Just read the document. It would be a little more complicated having more keys, but you get the idea.

So, it seems that a merchant that wants to ensure that transactions are picked up by miners can actually send a high mining fee transaction after every 0-conf transaction. This could be done automatically if it's included as a wallet feature.

You can have consensus without having 100% agreement.

Wouldn't a simple solution be to not include it in a block? Nobody is forcing miners to include these "spam" transactions, even without a block size limit.

Palm scan is used as identification next time you come to the machine. To make sure you aren't just having Susie and Johnny come by and buy/sell more bitcoins for you than the government will allow.

Actually these are all really good ideas and will likely happen. However, points systems will probably happen first. Instead of those punch cards that everyone forgets to bring back to get a free ice cream cone, you can just save up 10 Ice Cream Points for a free cone.
Why will this work well? Every time you go buy ice cream, you pay with bitcoin. The points are sent back to the address you spent from. Your wallet is smart and knows that you were sent points, and it automatically sorts it out for you. It will *just work*.

If they think their coins are more valuable, then why sell them so cheap? No one is making them lose money but themselves.

Also, with Coinbase, THEY are responsible for the security of your money.

They can only do one two things with their massive wealth:
1. Hold it. -- The way this will effect the rest of the economy will simply be keeping money out of circulation, increasing the value of *everyone's* wealth.
2. Spend it. -- This distributes the wealth to more people. This is *obviously* a good thing.
There is no negative consequence.

PA Public Utility Commission. I was put in charge of improving efficiency of systems in our bureau. The problem is that those in charge (bureau directors) are typically appointed as a political position. They try to come up with "innovative" ideas solely for the sake of improving their chances at getting an even better position, like director of operations, for example. They don't care what the consequences of their ideas are - they want it done now and don't care if doing it now will lead to a horrible product even though they could wait a year and have something that actually works. They come up with numbers that the commissioners want to see, and then have me come up with formulas to fit the numbers. It was a very dishonest job, which is what led me to quit in December.
The people that are put in charge at these agencies are typically people who think they are the greatest people in the world - and they will push their ideas no matter what.
And the commission doesn't care as long as they are seeing the numbers they want to see, regardless of how skewed they actually are.
You can't put a single person (or even a small group of people) in charge of making decisions for an entire state and industry. They make bad decisions for both consumers and industry players.

I don't know about him, but I did the same thing. Back around April of last year, it took WEEKS to get verified.

He sells bitcoins on localbitcoins, gets cash from the customer and instant buys the bitcoins right then and there. Since they don't withdraw the money right away from your bank account, as long as you deposit the money in the ATM right away, the money will be there when Coinbase takes it from your account. If not, you get hit with a fee each time they try to withdraw the money.

It's more like certification than regulation. Let's say you start a BitStandard company, and you certify everyone that meets your standards. Someone else starts a CoinSense company. They certify everyone that meets their standards. Some will meet both, some one or the other, some neither.

Nope! The purpose of mining IS to verify transactions. It is the first (and currently only) solution to the Byzantine generals problem. The first miner to "solve" each block of transactions gets the current reward (25 BTC every 10 minutes until roughly 2016 when the reward halves). The miners are rewarded for their work, because without them, we would not be able to trust the block chain!
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:27:40
You're right. They aren't solving it. But, it *can't* be solved without them. I didn't mean the solutions to the calculations are necessary, just that the work is necessary.

More fine control on what price your order is placed. So, let's say the price is $325 but you want to buy at $300, you can place your order now and it will fill when the price drops. Or, conversely, you just bought some at $310 and you want to sell at $400, you can do that, too.

Well, yeah. We wouldn't need any armies, but the laws of the economy are written into the code. We are creating economies that don't need governments. It is efficient to do things like this. I imagine one day there will be hundreds of flourishing crypto economies where different currencies can be instantly exchanged with each other, each exchange affecting the value of each economy. It's not about making profits, it's about taking back economic control.

Bitcoin is built in such a way that signing your coins over to someone should be indicative that you are actually GIVING them the coins, through contract. The protocol allows you to do all sorts of crazy things - there is **absolutely** no reason you should be SIGNING YOUR COINS OVER TO SOMEONE if you didn't intend to part with them.

I own it, but if I don't give it back, I'm an asshole. Of course, the state says otherwise.
I have four kids, the best way to deal with this shit is to explain that you don't physically take things from people's hands, ever. Even if it's "yours" and you want it back. Because, this is how fights start. When the kids stops yelling "HEY THAT'S MINE" or "HE TOOK MY..." and instead say "Hey, I know you're using that right now, but I'd really like to have it back," that's when progress is made.

Well, let's see. Half were mined in the first four years. Three-fourths will have been mined by 2016, leaving one-fourth to be mined. By 2020, an eighth of the coins will be left to mine. In 2024, 1/16 will be left - then by the year 2028, 96.875% of all the bitcoins will have been mined. It won't be until about 2140 that the last coin will have been rewarded to miners.

There's no added complexity. You just exchange from your phone's wallet for whatever currency you want. When you pay someone, they receive whatever currency they wany. They are all interchangeable. Stronger crypto economies will be more stable, smaller ones will offer more reward for those that risk getting in early. 
Meanwhile, you can passively support things like cancer research and electric cars by simply holding currency.

No, the bank is transferring money *from* a person, *to* an exchange. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. They are performing banking services. Also, merchants are allowed to accept bitcoin as payment, however they are not allowed to use services like BitPay that would automatically convert the bitcoins to their local currency.

You'd always be able to exchange it for things of value, including other currency. It really doesn't matter, it will literally never go away (even if only for the black market). And, because of its limited supply, it doesn't even really matter how many people use it, its deflationary nature will always make it worth more as time goes on.

Except, we're not talking about an exchange - we're talking about a bank. We're talking about the fact that, using bitcoin, no matter what the government or anyone else says, you can send money (any amount), from point A to point B and no one can stop you. REGARDLESS, of what any government or bank wants you to do, or even says is legal or illegal, they cannot stop you from doing it.

I wasn't clear I guess. The more someone with good reputation marks you as having good reputation, the higher your reputation gets. New accounts (not age, but lack of transactions), don't count for much. Known, trusted identities will have a lot of weight.
An identity created a year ago with no transactions won't be able to do any damage at all. Basically, to do business with them would be like doing business with someone that has no credit score.

Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) remove the need for full-on revolt. People can now work outside of existing economies. And, let's face it, the main purpose of the state is to create/enforce/protect their economies. If you are operating outside of that economy, you should not be subject to the rules that govern it.
People don't need to overthrow the existing systems. Simply create something new that will ultimately replace it (at least mostly -- think VHS to DVD).

While normally I would agree. (And to the sentiment, I do.) However, ownership of bitcoin is quite different than ownership of, well, *anything else*. Nobody actually *owns* bitcoin. People *control* bitcoin. If a party has full control of a private key, any action that person makes can have consequences regarding the control of the associated bitcoin. By allowing another entity full control of a private key, they've relinquished their own control. Multi-sig is a very important development that needs to be implemented everywhere that bitcoins are stored with a 3rd party.

I don't think so.

It's just a process that makes it increasingly difficult with time to go back and change history. That's what people mean when they say that mining is securing the block chain. If you wanted to reverse a transaction, you would have to change the block where the transaction occurred, find a NEW solution, and then keep finding solutions for blocks until you have the longest chain. With everyone constantly competing to get the next block, there is no way you can catch up with everyone else after going back and trying to change history. This is why the scheme is called Proof-of-Work. Get it?

I think you're misunderstanding the situation. He has the private key that was swept to the thief's address. This same key has been swept a number of times previously. If he monitors that address, he can race the thief to sweep the address, thus preventing the thief from stealing any more. Yes, he would then have someone else's bitcoins, but he would be able to make some attempt to return them to the rightful owner, where the thief would make no such attempt. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:01:01

He has the private key to the 1Bn9.... public key. For whatever reason a bunch of people have had the same key generated (some people are suggesting a bad PRNG) and the thief is using knowledge of the private key to sweep that address to his own address. Presumably, someone in the future will generate that same key, and their funds will get stolen by the thief, unless someone else sweeps them first. 
tl;dr - He doesn't. The thief has the key to the 1Bn9 address, along with everyone else he's stolen from.

While normally that would make sense, I have to disagree in the case of cryptocurrencies. One can easily imagine a decentralized exchange system that would enable someone to pay with ANY type of supported cryptocurrency and have the merchant receive payment in the currency of their choice. So, I could pay with dogecoin and the merchant would receive bitcoin. Or I pay with bitcoin and the merchant receives litecoin. This would happen automatically and without human intervention through the use of a future distributed autonomous cryptoexchange system.
There is plenty of room for competing currencies.

We have temporarily suspended Bitstamp services. Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9am UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full.
On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC. Upon learning of the breach, we immediately notified all customers that they should no longer make deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses. To repeat, customers should NOT make any deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses. As an additional security measure, we suspended our systems while we fully investigate the incident and actively engage with law enforcement officials.
This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.
We appreciate customers’ patience during this disruption of services. We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days. Customers can stay informed via updates on our website, on Twitter ( and through Bitstamp customer support at support

Why would he shut down SR? I think those types of free marketplaces ARE a benefit to society. Keeping drug deals off the streets, so that there are no longer "territories" that need to be defended. No more price fixing by force. Nobody getting drugs robbed from them at gunpoint, etc. It's much safer and much more ethical, in my opinion.

They store an encrypted copy of your private keys on their server. When you try to log in, they send the encrypted keys to you and your computer decrypts the keys with your password. If they changed the JavaScript on their end, they could have the password sent to them. There is a Chrome extension that lets you know if the JS has changed at all. I would recommend using the extension, using a secure password, and making sure that your backup location is secure (for example, if you have backups sent to Gmail, make sure you use 2FA and a strong password for Gmail).

This is it right here. Speaking as someone who recently left a high-paying government job, this is the real answer. The government doesn't have to pay competitive wages - no one can compete with the government, because they take money from their citizens to pay for their employees. No one else can afford to pay those FBI workers the same amount of money for the same amount of work - because the money that is being paid to them isn't actually profits from the work they are doing - it's money that has been practically stolen from everyone else in the country.
They are going to do what they are paid to do, or they are going to work a lot harder and get paid a lot less.

Personally, I support larger blocks, however I don't support forking the chain if there is any kind of debate (and there is). Wait until the air is crystal clear, and then fork away. 
The reason being, one side is likely trying to take advantage of the situation. Without KNOWING (with 100% certainty) which side, there is a chance that bitcoin could be compromised. And knowing that bitcoin is capable of being compromised, reduces faith in the overall system.

I'm more into ignoring laws and simply living the way I want to, and encouraging others to do the same. Advocating to change laws only provides legitimacy to those who believe they have power over the people. It's the same reason a lot of people don't vote - it provides legitimacy to the system. I believe government itself is illegitimate and choose not to respect the laws that they make. The solution is to walk away. If you are literally contributing to the system, by trying to change laws and vote for politicians, then yes, you are part of the problem.

It's backed by the utility of the blockchain. The blockchain is useful for decentralized applications, programmable global communications, global time stamping, smart property, etc. that is extremely valuable regardless and even ignorant of the value of bitcoin as a currency. Thus, bitcoin will ALWAYS have at least some utility value, leaving the rest of its value to the laws of supply and demand. The math and programming ensures the scarcity of bitcoin. This is how it's "backed" as a currency. It's why you can trust that it won't just go away and that nobody can *poof* more of it into existence.

Okay if you have $40 in Circle, you're good. Now, all you need to do is send it to a private bitcoin wallet (like Mycelium, AirBitz, Breadwallet, etc.).  
The $40 in Circle is basically a credit that is good for bitcoins. As soon as you instruct them to send the amount to your private bitcoin address, they will send you real bitcoins. To do this, within the Circle app, click on Send Money from the main menu, then paste (or scan) your bitcoin address in the "Name, Email, Phone" field. Your bitcoins will arrive in your private wallet in just a few moments.
Let me know if you have any other questions at all.

It is. Very much. But, it will likely happen. The difference would be that we could easily trade USD Coin for other cryptocurrencies. There would be much less friction between the networks. There may also be an increase in transparency, however that "transparency" would still require a certain level of trust, due to the permissioned/federated setup.
@_date: 2016-01-30 04:35:56
You have to find somewhere to buy them from, that's all. Circle and Coinbase allow you to link a bank account to buy bitcoins. However, once purchasing them, I recommend moving them to a private wallet, as both of their wallets are custodial (they have control of the bitcoins). Other alternatives would be online/local marketplaces like localbitcoins.com and paxful.com. If you want to buy large amounts/trade, you need to wire money to an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 22:59:02
It's worse than that. The original article had a typo. 290,000 DDK = 43,600 USD, not 436,000 USD. It was a 117 bitcoin transaction.

I feel like it shouldn't be difficult. Players agree on a block number (next block mined three deep, for example), put their bet in lock, and specify a payout address. The last digit of the hash of the preselected block determines the outcome of the coin flip (0/even heads, odd tails).

How will they just take a little longer? 40 minute block on average, right? So four times as many transactions will be competing for the same 1mb block, and the blocks come 75% slower. That's not just a little longer. That's an endless line of people waiting.

40 min block = 8 week difficulty adjustment
Think about all of the unconfirmed transactions piling up waiting to be confirmed in those 1mb blocks every 40 minutes.

The fork created a separate bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash. If you follow the Bitcoin Cash chain, you can see if it is helping or not. Important metrics would be block size and transaction fees per kilobyte.

I completely understand that point of view. And I'm not saying you would want to. I'm talking about safety towards any sort of change in a system like this. If you change something that works, and you make a change to that system, you should make sure you can reverse ANY change easily in case the change breaks the system in some unknown way.


Seriously? I advocate Bitcoin to every person I know in real life. I own a significant amount of Bitcoin. I've been obsessed with Bitcoin and the advent of cryptocurrencies for almost a decade now.


...is a literal scam. I've been interested in Ethereum/smart contracts since before either were a thing. Until Bitcoin is a crypto entity that can do exactly what I need it to, I'm going to also use Ethereum. I'm obsessed with machines, especially digital machines that use literal digital tokens and gas to run them. It's insanely cool to play with.

@_date: 2019-08-08 19:39:06
Tell, me, how big is this block? 
That's the whole point of SegWit - it essentially takes the more cumbersome data away from Bitcoin‘s main chain and stores it elsewhere – increasing the overall theoretic block size to somewhere around 4MB.
Yes - it's even convenient that it doesn't have to rebroadcast that extra data and that it's not bloating the main chain - I GET IT. I LIKE IT, EVEN. I'm just saying that 2MB blocks WOULD NOT have hurt, if also combined with SegWit. Do we need it RIGHT NOW? No, absolutely not. But I have a fear that when the extra space is needed, there will no longer be support for a HARD FORK on a coin that's worth tens of thousands of dollars. That's all.
I'm 100% okay with the way Bitcoin is right now. I'm not saying it needs to be changed. All I ever said (back then) was I thought 2MB was a good size. I still don't think it would have hurt anything, even today. And every time I ever said it I was called a troll, a shill, or whatever else.
Also, about "undoing" a block-size change. You just check blocks after a certain block number, you don't rewrite history. But I really don't even want to argue about this point, because I never said hard forks were better than soft forks, I was only implying that they should both be taken seriously, because one creates backwards incompatibility, and the latter is impossible to reverse without the former.

It's not just *my* car. It's the entire highway system. It would be as if the entire US changed the material the road was made out of, all at once. If something catastrophic would happen (let's just say it melts tires after a month on the new surface), ans it takes significant effort to change it back (maybe it takes 10 seconds to install it, but half a year to reverse it), then that would be a pretty bad thing, and traffic would be at a standstill for months.


So what, it's now a bad thing to HATE Bitcoin and it's bad to LOVE Bitcoin. Have to be indifferent about it to have an opinion. Okay.


You were implying that it was a scam. I suppose it was wrong for me to assume that you believe scams are a bad thing and shouldn't exist.
Edit: Also, how exactly is Ethereum a "scam"? If you're referring to the hard fork from the DAO, I really have to disagree.

It was a shitshow. I was a proponent of SegWit along with a couple other BIPs (can't remember which, I think one was Greg's). Any time I argued that a simple doubling of the block size couldn't be abused, I was met with harsh criticism and called a shill. People were acting like it would absolutely destroy the network and decentralization, yet 2MB blocks exist now and we're still going strong.

My idea of a discussion is talking about ideas out in the open. Not repeating the same thing until I get my way (ironically, that seems to be what you are doing right now).
A lot of their ideas are indeed flawed. Some of their ideas deserve more discussion than was ever given - they were simply dismissed because they got lumped in with all of their other ideas.

YES! This is why I was 100% for Segwit. Personally, I liked Segwit2X (NOTE: NOT AS A CONTENTIOUS HARDFORK - ONLY IF THAT WAS THE CONSENSUS SOLUTION).
I agree with you on everything you are saying. The only thing I'm trying to point out is that this place was (and still is a lot of the times) absolutely toxic whenever anyone has any ideas that don't conform to the status quo.
I sold any BCash I had as soon as it split (other than what I have stored with some BTC on some long-term cold storage that I haven't accessed yet).
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:27:07
I support Bitcoin and I think a lot of what you said is unfair and untrue. A lot of it is also true.
For example, soft forks are arguably worse than hard forks. A soft fork can *only* be reversed by a hard fork. It's simpler to reverse a hard fork.
Also, some people did not want SegWit as a scaling solution (myself included). However, I was pro-SegWit for other reasons, that you mentioned in your post. I, and many others, believe that a more aggressive approach to scaling is needed.
Back when this was happening, all discussion about scaling was stifled because if you were advocating for anything other than SegWit, you got lumped in with the Bcash/Bitmain shills, and your opinion no longer mattered to anyone. It was insanely frustrating. You refer to this as "bitcoiners with different opinions."
And when did it become not okay for someone to have a stake in both Bitcoin and Ethereum?? They are different things with different purposes. They can, and should, both co-exist.

That's a pretty irrelevant question. There are many places popping up where you can walk in with cash and leave with bitcoins - in fact, I just started a business that does exactly that. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:55:52
It would only affect bitcoins mined after the blockchain splits. 
Well, that's not entirely true. Old bitcoins (pre-fork) would be able to be spent on ~~EITHER~~ BOTH chains. Post-fork coins would have to be spent on the chain in which they were mined.
This will have an effect on old bitcoins value, as they can be spent on either chain, they will have different values depending on which chain you spend them on. For example, if XT coins are worth $300 and Core coins are worth $50, pre-fork coins will have a different value depending on how they are spent. If spending with someone that only accepts Core coins, your bitcoins will not have as much spending power as they would of you spent them with someone accepting XT coins.
Once they are spent on either chain at that point, they are tied to the chain in which they were spent.

No. You need to convince the server that you are in the correct position to mine the block, that it takes the correct amount of time to mine the block, etc. The server knows where every block in the game is.

Miners choose which transactions to include in a block. In order to make the most money, they will include those transactions that pay them the most, first. There is no guarantee that zero fee  transactions will ever be mined.

@_date: 2015-08-19 19:55:36
Not really. The transaction will be picked up by both chains. I suppose when the split first occurs, confirmation times will be much, much longer on the Core chain, since it will only have 25% hashing power. So, for a period of a couple months, it will be easier to double-spend transactions on the Core chain.

It doesn't, by itself. It does set the starting bid, though. Imagine I need to give my tokens value (they may already have utility value, but I want to give them initial monetary value) - I burn $100 per coin and now I can start selling those coins at $100 each. People know that they aren't enriching the creator of the token, and it has established value that they can then pass on. It's just a neat way to bootstrap these microeconomies, otherwise the first people to have access to the tokens have a huge price advantage over latecomers. 
If every token has $100 proof-of-burn, there's no way the asset creator can afford to just give the tokens away.

Except the $700 went to a Chinese hardware company, and the $300 went to a Chinese utility company. The $1000 CNY stayed in the country. A good was produced (Bitcoin), and then typically sold to someone outside of the country for $1000, bringing more money INTO China.
Edit: even if those Bitcoin aren't sold, and are instead used abroad by the miner, it's still zero-sum for the Chinese government. They don't care about this scenario.

He used a recovery script to move funds to a new address. The script missed a large number of inputs (didn't include them in the output). When this happened, whatever the difference between inputs and outputs was the fee. So... 85 BTC were accidentally sent as a fee, which the miner (Bitmain) collected, due to the buggy script. Bitmain refunded the fee to Bitgo, whom then made OP whole again. I think.

Fork means the code is getting split in a non-compatible way, which means that the blockchain will "fork" into two, like a fork in the road. Bitcoin before the fork are spendable on either chain, whereas Bitcoins after the fork are only spendable on the chain they were created in or spent on.

Let's say I create a new altcoin. I issue 40,000 coins total, and want them to each have a value of 0.001 BTC. I can publicly burn 40 bitcoins when bringing these other coins into existence, proving to you (my potential coin-user), that these 40,000 coins are now worth 40 bitcoins to me. I can sell them at 0.001 BTC each, and you will know that I would buy them back for you around that same price, because it cost me that much to create them. It's a way of giving things value that would otherwise not have value. A kind of digital bootstrap.

I've worked for government agencies. One of the biggest problems is that each agency uses different technology, and more often than not, they don't share access with other agencies because of security reasons. For example, my state's Public Utility Commission has NO access to Dept of Human Services (welfare) and vice versa, even though a lot of the program eligibility requirements overlap. The only reason those connections don't exist is because the agencies are so huge, splintered, and bureaucratic and there's absolutely no good way for a standard database to be created and used that will be secure. State agencies don't like to innovate - they like to use things that are pre-existing. By using the blockchain as a standard, immutable database, it would solve all of the technical, bureaucratic problems. 
Edit: Other examples would be things like vehicle registration. The state could implement a legal format for smart contracts and citizens could transfer ownership without meeting at the DMV. 
Another unrelated problem blockchain tech could solve (and this is bitcoin specific) would be utility payments. Utility companies are regulated by the state, but often times their billing/accounting software is not good enough to show proof of payments. It's usually a huge mess. Verizon alone has THREE separate systems they use for billing and accounting, and even then they submit hand-written account statements at times. By utilizing blockchain (bitcoin) payments, there can be a very clear history of payments, especially when the electric companies complete their smart grids. They're already talking about prepaid access by selling prepaid electric cards at convenience stores - if you've seen the Bitfluid demo, that technology can easily be put on the meter. Having something like this in place would save taxpayers sooooooo much money. I worked as a utility complaint investigator for a while - blockchain accounting solves 85% of the complaints.

Sorry, maybe I misunderstood you then. Are you saying that wallet developers are going to hard code their preferred maximum blocksize?

Pubkey hash is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
Think about how hard it is just to hash a few 0s when you're mining bitcoin. Now think about how difficult it would be to hash ALL zeros. You'd basically have to do that. Not only is the private key knowingly unknown, but the public key is also knowingly unknown.
You'd have a better chance of winning every lottery in existence every day for a year than randomly generating the key to that address.

Try  for escrow. Also, if the Bitcoin price dips during inspection, maybe the seller would be okay with you just sending more to make up for it? He'll already be guaranteed the original amount through the escrow service. 
That being said, it would be nice if escrow sites like this allowed you to choose an exchange rate source and then allowed you to deposit 8% extra in case of volatility.

Let's say you have a Samsung Galaxy X15 with Bitsmart™ by 21 technology built in. By default, the phone submits hashes to 21's pool while it's charging. In return, you get points that can be spent in the Samsung appstore, or you can just cash out X satoshis per time spent mining. This same concept can be applied to TVs where you mine in exchange for points towards movie rentals or whatever.

There should be a way to split them so they can work on both chains. I'm not 100% sure, that's why I said it would be tricky. From what I understand, coins had to be run through a special contract to be split for ETH/ETC. Hopefully someone else knows the answer to that question. Because if you send from one chain, that same send can be replayed on the other chain. I mean, I guess if you send from both chains to a new address, at the same time, you should probably be okay?

Yeah, but there's a difference between regulation and guidelines. I'm all for several independent agencies rating different exchanges, wallets, etc and giving them scores on different aspects. Then we could have Wallet A which meets X, Y, and Z standards, and Wallet B which meets X and Y standards (which might be fine for some people because Agency Z has stricter standards for anonymity, which doesn't really affect security). 
Maybe Wallet C didn't apply for ratings from any of the agencies, but I still want to use it because it's open source and I trust the code. That would be fine in this situation, and anyone using them would know that they haven't been rated. 
I feel like this works better than a $5000 license.

The blockchain will split and there will be two versions of Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin will be split between the chains. So if 10% of the users switch to the forked chain, it will have 10% of Bitcoin's value, and Bitcoin will be worth 10% less. If you think 90% will use the new fork, you may want to consider moving to the new chain as well. Your coins will work on both chains, until you move them, then they'll be stuck in the chain you moved them to. You can split them and move them on both chains, buy that's kinda tricky. All you need to do is sit back and watch, and when the dust settles, choose your chain depending on what is more valuable to you.

There are 1000 keys. Any 400 of those 1000 keys can be combined to sign a transaction that will move the $1million to any number of accounts. So, the goal is to either find 400 yourself, or work together with others to find the 400 and split it up with each other.

Again, I would ALWAYS use PGP encryption to communicate that kind of information. Every guide to using darknet markets stresses that as the NUMBER ONE security precaution. That way, the unencrypted address never touches the server, and is only decrypted on the vendor's side.

Guess what? The contract still exists and works as intended on the original chain. What happened is a NEW chain was forked from the CLASSIC chain.

So, if you had been in the Ethereum community at the time, and you were given the option to follow either fork, knowing that the vast majority of the community was pro-fork, which would you have followed? Why would you have been offended by a voluntary fork? If you were not invested in The DAO, the fork would not have affected you, if you were invested in The DAO, the fork would have benefitted you. The only individual that the fork was detrimental to was the individual draining the contract using a recursive race condition. He was the only one "forked off".

Actually, it does. Find any religion with less than 10% of the religious market and see how well it's faring compared to those above 10%. The problem is that there are competing religions that each hold more than 10% of the religious market, and each have their own unshakable beliefs. For the belief to be adopted by the majority, it has to have little to no "unshakable" competition.

Well, coinbase.com for one. Also, you can purchase bitcoins for cash through bitinstant.com (4% fee). Just put in how much USD you want to spend and you'll get the equivalent in coins at the current exchange rate.

Unfortunately, it's kind of a pain to generate the codes, because you can only send them as emails or SMS messages. So, I just emailed a bunch to myself and created QR codes from the links.

Honestly, it wasn't really a nonsense comment. For a lot of people, that *is* the appeal. In fact, it is one reason that I continue to choose to use such a volatile currency.
@_date: 2013-09-09 14:19:09
Anyone should be able to print money, that doesn't mean anyone will use it. I could start printing lentil-soup bucks but no one will use them, because there aren't any built-in controls. This is one of the reasons that cryptocurrencies are incredible.
Money that can be "printed", like the US dollar(technically: "counterfeited") will eventually be worthless, in my opinion, because anyone can counterfeit it. The government and other organized criminals do it on a regular basis.

I use this app to keep track of and pay all of my bills. If I could use this to pay my bills with bitcoins, that would be amazing. How can we get this to happen? Would it be better to contact Check and ask them directly, or should BitPay or Coinbase try to partner with them?
**Edit**: I already sent them a message - I hope I don't sound overzealous:
I (and thousands of others) would absolutely love it if you could support Bitcoin as a payment option. Just as the Gyft app made it possible to shop at retail stores with bitcoins (by selling gift cards for bitcoins), you could be the connection between our Bitcoin wallets and our bills. It would be HUGE. Whenever you ask someone what they want to be able to do with bitcoins, the number one answer is almost always "pay my bills" (or "buy gas"). $1.2 billion dollar market waiting to pay bills. You could make it happen. And using a service like BitPay or Coinbase, it would be easy for you to set up, and you'd save money on fees, too!
**Edit2**: I also made a comment on their [Facebook page](

From their FAQ:
**What if I bet after a bet is closed?**
 You're screwed. BitBet will keep your bet, report it as revenue (under the gracious donations to shareholders heading in the monthly reports) and distribute it to shareholders. 
Do not bet after a bet is closed, and just to be on the safe side don't bet on a proposition that's imminently going to close (such as don't bet after the condition of the bet has been satisfied in the hopes of peeling some BTC off the suckers that took the risk). Also, it's always a good idea to include a fee in your transaction: they aren't really that much and the network depends on them by design.

Okay, I'm going to ask you a serious question. If these are the goals of coin validation, why don't you just skip straight to the thing that is going to eventually replace you? Why not just start the reputation block chain?
You can generate as many reputations as you wish (just like Bitcoin addresses), and then as people do business with you, they rate your trustworthiness, which adds to your reputation, weighted based on the reputation of the person rating you. This will be a decentralized, trustless system, just like Bitcoin. It will allow users to build up reputation. If that reputation becomes tarnished, they would have the option of starting over (having to regain trust, starting from 0). Everyone deserves a clean slate. These addresses don't have to be tied to "real" identities for this to work, either. We will be able to transact anonymously over the internet, with Bitcoin, with relative peace-of-mind with this system.
Why centralize when decentralization works so much better?
I would really like to hear your thoughts on this.

It's not centrally controlled. Where do you get that idea?
The platform is not mutable. A new chain was created that converted the contract to a refund contract. People voluntarily chose to move to the new chain. No one forced that upon anyone. And the original chain still exists, with The DAO still working as it did from the beginning.
And yes, it was an attack. Or would you also say that if you leave your backdoor open and someone robs you, that it wasn't a burglary because your door was open so obviously people are allowed to take your things?

A credit union is a member-owned bank. When you deposit money in your account, you are actually purchasing shares - when you withdraw you are selling your shares. Most credit unions make you keep a very small minimum amount of money (around $5) in your account so that you can retain membership.

I think a lot of that mindset is due to the fact that people have been saying, for a very long time, that Bitcoin is either worth 0 or infinity. It's a known binary bet.

I buy everything with bitcoin, other than mortgage, car insurance, utilities and doctor's visits. Those are the only things I buy with dollars. If a major retailer gets in and starts doing massive amounts of bitcoin transactions, there will need to be massive amounts of cash flowing INTO bitcoin to even facilitate those transactions in the first place. The do not "need" to close their books for shareholders. They could pay out shares in bitcoin - because at the point you are talking about, where they are doing $billions transactions in bitcoin, the market cap would be huge and merchant/supplier adoption will have already increased exponentially.

Let's say there's about $50 trillion dollars in the world today.

Inflation is a form of free taxation. Instead of taking dollars from you, they have the bank print them and "borrow" that money from the bank. The value of everyone's money goes down, and the government has more money. Sounds like a tax to me.

Nobody said I didn't buy any. The machines were basically a hedge in case price went down short term, we'd mine more coins if the price took longer to take off. I'm pretty sure I even advised the same to someone on Reddit recently. If price is going up short term (6 months or so), buying is better. If you think it will hold or go down short term, mining could be better.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:46:45
I'm confused about your statement. Are you claiming the Ethereum blockchain is hackable? Because it is currently using the same security model as Bitcoin, and by some metrics, is actually more secure. And if you are speaking about The DAO, surely you realize it wasn't secure, which is how the attack happened in the first place.
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:57:08
Let's do some more math. $1.60 * 30 = $48. ($1.60 * 0.9) * 30 = $43.20. (($1.60 * 0.9) * 0.9) * 30 = $38.88. ((($1.60 * 0.9) * 0.9) * 0.9) * 30 = $34.99, etc.... $31.49, $28.34, $25.51, $22.96. So, after 8 months you have more than what you paid for the device. This is assuming that the exchange rate stays where it is. More than likely the exchange rate will go up. Let's say 10% every month... you do the math.

No, I did.  basically says that all value is assigned and that there is no such thing as "intrinsic value"  seems to say that it is money because it is used as money through market exchanges (which is what I was saying originally, with the black market value).
Maybe I'm just confused on what your point is? Sorry...
All I was originally saying is that because it *has* value, and because it is limited in supply the value will only grow as more people use it, and as long as it will always have value (even if only due to the black market), it will never be valueless, so it will always be useful.
It sounds like I'm saying a whole bunch of nothing, but I think it's a pretty good point...

Because doing this provides stability and steady deflation to the currency. If no one spent it, it would lose value. If people were constantly selling for fiat profit, it would lose value. Spending is the only way for it to retain value as a currency.

Nobody would "need" to cash out their bitcoins at that point.

Bitcoin makes money better better because of its properties. It is non-physical, which makes it not only cheaper to move (no armored cars and security guards), but also faster. That alone is high inherent value. It makes it cheaper and faster to use money.
Not to mention that you can use the block chain for escrow, smart contracts, and colored coins (imagine a decentralized stock exchange).
I think these have much higher value than jewelry and "resistant to tarnish"... bitcoin is IMMUNE to tarnish and does not react with *anything*.

@_date: 2013-11-24 00:37:51
I'm not necessarily *against* speculation. It's just that it doesn't serve as much of a purpose now that it is actually easy to live off of bitcoin almost completely. The only thing I cash out my bitcoin for are things I can't pay for in bitcoin, like my mortgage and utilities (this one will be taken care of soon enough -- I work for a state utility commission and the utilities I've talked to so far are loving the idea of being able to accept bitcoin for payment)...
But, yeah, if you can live off Bitcoin, and see ~100% gains from paycheck to paycheck... why wouldn't you just convert each of your paychecks to bitcoin and basically live life for free? (this is what I mean by you don't need a lot.) Even if the gains are only 5%, you could still live life greatly discounted.

I assume you mean blockchain.info's MyWallet? It's actually a really good wallet. They keep a copy of your encrypted wallet.dat on their server (which you should keep backed up locally, just in case), and all of the code is executed locally on your computer.

Eh. Okay, I give up. Personally, I read the rules before I send people non-refundable money over the internet. It was clearly stated what would happen. The person was relying on *someone else* to send money for him to a website that he wasn't clear on the rules on, to a bet that was ending shortly. I don't see how someone could reasonably expect that to turn out okay, but I guess in the sue-happy society we live in, we are throwing rationality to the wind and blaming others for our mistakes.

Why would Bitpay have an incentive to stick to one currency? I imagine that in the future there will be a payment processor that allows people to pay in whatever cryptocurrency they choose, and the merchant gets paid in whatever cryptocurrency *they* choose. So, I could pay with Peercoin and the merchant could receive Bitcoin. Or, I could pay with Bitcoin and the merchant receives Litecoin. This would seem ideal to me.

Hell, even if you're not a millionaire, but you've recently seen your wealth increase. Use that newly found wealth to promote awareness in your community. Buy cheap Android tablets and distribute them to local merchants, print out pamphlets and "Bitcoin Accepted Here" stickers. Find a local artist that will design a Bitcoin-related piece of work to display in their shop window... whether it's a sculpture or an air-brushed tee shirt... Get used mobile devices into the hands of poor people, with bitcoin wallets pre-installed, maybe even a few satoshis. Go out, in your community, and turn your local economy around.

Have you tried purchasing a house with cash? How would you even go about getting that much money out of your bank acocunt?


I buy bitcoin because I prefer it over dollars. I use my bitcoin the same way I would use my dollars, spend some, save some. Except my savings amount to more over time, rather than less. I'd say that's a huge advantage over using dollars for ANYTHING.


I have plenty of use for bitcoin (other than as currency), and I can't think of a single thing I would find gold useful for (that can't be replaced with something other than gold).

"Nobody" is an exaggeration. I only spend dollars when absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:08:38
Sure. If you think the value in a few years will be higher than it is now, invest as much as you are comfortable with (it should sting to lose your investment, but not devastate you), and keep that amount very, very safe. Like on multiple paper wallets prepared on an offline computer, stored in very safe physical locations.
Then, to help with stability and growth, start buying bitcoin on a regular basis (like a small amount every time you get paid), and spend it on things you would normally spend your dollars on. There are apps like Gyft that allow you to buy gift cards, and online retailers like Bitcoinshop.us, Bitcoinstore.com, etc. Also, anytime you buy something from a local store/restaurant/cafe/etc., ask them if they accept bitcoin yet (if they don't know what it is, explain it to them and explain the benefits to accepting them). Ask people to pay you in bitcoin if they can.
So, you have your long-term investment, safe and sound. And you have smaller, short-term investments that help build the bitcoin economy, ensuring more growth and overall stability. 
It's really that simple. :)

Actually, I think it is a good thing, because they allow for the merchants to keep a portion or percentage of the profits in bitcoin, while converting the rest to local currency so they can pay for operating costs. It's only an option to receive payment in local currency, not a standard. In fact, you have to tell it you want fiat; bitcoin payment is the default. Eventually, when suppliers accept bitcoin for fiat, the retailers can accept full bitcoin, and so on and so forth until everyone is full bitcoin. It's a great process.

I think you are misunderstanding his post. If Bitcoin is successful in its fullest capacity, most functions of government will become redundant - we will no longer be able to be controlled. We will have ultimate personal freedom regardless of if we are rich or not. Most people don't realize that money doesn't inherently give us the power to travel and pursue our dreams. Money is not real. It is a social construct. Bitcoin has the power to free us from that construct. If you have trouble understanding this, that's completely understandable because it requires a HUGE shift in the way everyone thinks. See post below. He gets it. Once Bitcoin is operating at max potential, hyperdeflation sets in and money becomes meaningless, yet we will see that everything continues to work the way it should.

You can't account for speculation, though. Sure, maybe it's really only worth $250 *right now*, but there are a **lot** of people that realize it will be worth much more in the future, so they are holding on to it, waiting for it to become more valuable, which increases the price *right now*.

Actually, blockchain.info runs on your computer. They keep a copy of your encrypted wallet in the cloud - when you log in, you download the wallet and decrypt it with your password. Then, all of the code is executed locally on your computer. It's basically just a way to access a local client from any computer without having to install anything.
Also, anytime a change is made to your wallet, it is automatically backed up to your email/dropbox/whatever you tell it to backup to, so if they go down, you don't lose anything.

Okay, so if the 3's outnumber the 4's, the price goes up, which can turn some of the 1's into 4's, which can either stabilize the price, or turn it into a situation where 4's outnumber 3's, causing the price to take a dip/dive?

Yes, but you would probably want to create a new paper wallet, rather than reusing one that necessarily had the private key exposed (which would have occurred when transferring the coins *out* of the paper wallet).

* I keep a decent amount on Blockchain.info (with all kinds of passwords and 2FA enabled, obviously), because it is easily accessible from anywhere, and relatively very secure (plus instant backups, who doesn't like that??).

You should mention that a dynamic QR code can be generated on a cheap android tablet, alleviating the need for the cashier to do the math conversion of dollars to bitcoins. It would also prevent the customer from accidentally typing the wrong amount into their wallet, and the cashier wouldn't have to check for a text message - the tablet would verify the transaction instantly.
I'm working on starting a similar campaign in my hometown, and I am actually planning on giving away tablets to merchants that want one (maybe I'll make a deal like after 3 months they can either buy the tablet from me for $80 or they can return it so I can give more tablets to merchants... or they can just have it. I haven't really decided yet.)

I guess it's a plus that I can read and understand code, then. It's unfortunate for those people that don't understand math and cryptography, I suppose.
But, what I'm saying is that you can check to make sure your algorithm is correct by comparing it with a known, correct algorithm. We can decentralize the secondary trust issue (how do I know which one is correct?) by embedding a hash of the algorithm into the block chain using a proof-of-existence scheme. Then, you can always compare your algorithm to the known correct algorithm. There's no need to trust anyone.

Your bitcoins are stored in the exact amounts as they were input. So, say you deposited $40, $60, $20 at three separate times. It's like having a $40, $60, and $20 bill in your wallet. When you spend an amount lower than that, you receive change back, to a change address in your wallet. I think qt makes a new address every time you make change for yourself (I could be wrong about that part, I've never used it). That's how I understand it all, anyway. I'm pretty new to this.

[BitPay]( is probably the solution you are looking for.

This is my favorite part!
"Outside of financial institutions covered by the PBC regulation, there is no other legal restriction for using bitcoins as the medium of transactions.
I don't want to use the word "currency" since legally speaking bitcoin is not a currency in either HK or Mainland China.  The fact that bitcoin is *NOT* a currency means that it can be used for transactions in Mainland China.  If it was a currency you couldn't legally use it for a transaction in Mainland China, so the fact that the Chinese authorities consider bitcoin a commodity and not a currency is extremely important. 
Same for HK.  You can use anything for a transaction, but if you convert currencies, you need a money broker license.
One good thing about the Chinese announcement is that by declaring bitcoin to be a "commodity" that creates legal certainty for how it is to be regulated."

Why would they have to make up the difference in price? It says this:


So, basically, you cancel any pending or open orders, then transfer your coins to another exchange. I don't see how this would affect mtgox at all. They don't have to make up for anything. Am I missing something?

I have an idea. What about a decentralized, trustless, anonymous reputation consensus network? Just like bitcoin, but we assign trustworthiness to each address whenever we do business with a person. Our rating is weighted by our own reputation. The protocol can be a layer on top of bitcoin.

Think about this, though. Multiple currencies are being traded for bitcoin on a single exchange. Let's say lots of Chinese people are buying bitcoin with yuan, and they are buying from US customers that want paid in USD. Where do the dollars come from, and where does the yuan go? Delays are inevitable.

It will have value. It will serve as an exchange currency. I put in dollars, get XRP, easily convertible to BTC, Euro, Yen, Whatever. The more XRP I have, the more things I can convert. I could theoretically run a local exchange using XRP as an exchange medium.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:58:39
What difference would it make? 800 bitcoins now would have the same value as 700 bitcoins in the future. I'm not going to try to steal value from the future. If I need a house now, and I can afford it (without affecting my savings too much), I will do it. I wouldn't spend all of my savings, but only what I could afford.
If I were to follow your logic, I would never, ever, buy a house, because it would always be cheaper in the future. If I would never buy a house, then did I really need a house in the first place? If I really needed a house, I would *need* to buy it, and therefore this argument doesn't make any sense, because I would buy it as long as I could afford it.
No, I would not buy a house just because I have 800 bitcoins laying around. I would only buy it if I needed it and could afford it.

Then, the uncertainty should cause you to spend. Your original argument was "Why spend BitCoin if it will be worth more tomorrow?" If you don't know it will be worth more tomorrow, then what *is* your point?

[Coinbase]( is probably the best way to do it. BTC to bank account. Takes a little while, but definitely the easiest method. $1 minimum.

Each USB miner costs 1.99 BTC. It looks like he has 36 of them, so an initial cost of 1.99 BTC * 36 = 71.64 BTC ≈ $9,227 USD. Each one of these operates at 300MH/s, and has a power draw of around 5W. That's 10,800MH/s at 180W. Costs about $0.0144 per hour to run these at a cost of 8 cents per kWh. This will generate 0.018621 BTC per hour.
Assuming that difficulty and exchange rate stay where they are, he will break even at 161 days, and generate a net **profit** of $11,689.58 over 1 year, mining a total of 163.12 BTC.

This may help even more with your perspective. When someone says they bought "a bitcoin" what they've actually done is bought 100,000,000 "satoshis". The bitcoin protocol does not actually deal in anything except satoshis; BTC is just a useful way for clients to deal with those large numbers.

He's not overthinking it. He's thinking about it in philosophical terms. *Why* is there a social agreement not to accept counterfeit money? Everyone *could* choose to accept it and use it, but it debases the rest of the money supply because it was "created out of thin air" -- it has no transaction history.

I think what he means by that, is that even though TCP/IP may not have been perfect, and surely something better *could* have been developed, people started building things around it, and the infrastructure just sort of grew and grew until there was no room for anything else to compete.

The money in your bank. Always spend the bad money before the good money, but *whenever* the opportunity arises, dump the bad for the good. If it becomes easy to acquire bitcoins (such as Coinbase's Instant and Recurring buys), it makes no sense to spend dollars on anything else.

Well, it's better to spend the 50 BTC on the car, and immediately buy $50,000 worth of BTC to replace what you spent. This way, you are supporting the bitcoin economy, which makes bitcoin more valuable, while still retaining your holdings.
In this way, the only thing that dollars become useful for is to buy bitcoins. Why spend dollars on anything *except* bitcoins, and in that case, you *must* spend bitcoins, which makes them more valuable.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:43:23
Profit does not have to be monetary. Profit can be intellectual or social in nature. Do you remember learning in school about an era known as the Renaissance? Humanism, Art, Science and Self-Awareness could possibly defeat monetary profit motives altogether in this type of economy. Also, there will always be basic things that people will always need, like food, shelter, clothing, etc. Most other objects like toys and games would be able to be downloaded, 3d printed, etc. Even if jobs are scarce, not everyone will need a job. Mining could even become a feasible source of income again once monetary profit motives begin to dwindle.
Would that really be a bad thing?

# Current Programs
To protect against unfriendly AI (Artificial Intelligence).
 
To protect against devastating asteroid strikes.
 
To protect against bioweapons and pandemics.
 
As the Internet grows in importance, an attack on it could cause physical as well as informational damage. An attack today on hospital systems or electric utilities could lead to deaths. In the future an attack could be used to alter the output that is produced by nanofactories worldwide leading to massive deaths.
 
**LifeShield Bunkers**
Developing fallback positions on Earth in case programs such as our BioShield and NanoShield fail globally or locally.
  
To protect against ecophages and nonreplicating nanoweapons.
 
This shield strives to protect scientists from obstacles that would prevent latter day Max Plancks from completing their research.
 
To prevent nuclear, biological, and nanotechnological attacks from occurring by using surveillance and sousveillance to identify terrorists before they are able to launch their attacks.
  
**Space Habitats**
To build fail-safes against global existential risks by encouraging the spread of sustainable human civilization beyond Earth.
  
 
# Future Programs
To preserve animal life and diversity on the planet.
 
To protect against unwanted climate changes.
 
Explores new communication technology for surviving existential events.
 
If our civilization ran out of energy, it would grind to a halt, so Lifeboat Foundation is looking for solutions.
 
To preserve the information created by our civilization, including technology as well as art and culture.
 
The program explores new life-extension methods, such as the work of Aubrey de Grey and Robert A. Freitas, Jr.
 
To prevent abuse in the areas of neuropharmaceuticals, neurodevices, and neurodiagnostics. Worst cases include enslaving the world’s population or causing everyone to commit suicide.
 
To prevent nuclear holocaust including destruction of entire cities.
 
To prevent, and also make plans on surviving when possible, particle accelerator mishaps including quantum vacuum collapse, mining the quantum vacuum, formation of a stable strangelet, and the creation of artificial mini-black holes.
 
Methods of preserving persons — or just their personalities — include cryopreservation and uploading.
 
To preserve plant life and diversity on the planet by storing seeds in a safe location and other methods.
 
 
# Long Range Programs
To prevent annihilation by an alien race (biological or otherwise).
 
To prevent antimatter-based annihilation.
 
To protect against black holes that are not manmade. This would include an “eye to the sky” program that would scan for signs of them.
 
To protect against gamma ray bursts.
 
To protect against and/or cope with our sun becoming a red giant and other harmful fluctuations in its output.

Let's say I purchase bitcoins and send them to my address A. Then I send them to my address B. Then I send them to someone else's address C to buy drugs.
Let's look at this transaction chain again. Bitcoins are sent from *somewhere* to address A (maybe the NSA knows that you used BitInstant to send the coins directly to your address - that's fine). You send bitcoins to address B (No one knows who owns this address - you generated it on your computer - for all an outside observer knows, you just sent these coins to your friend or bought a pizza or gambled them away online.) Then, whoever owns address B sent coins to address C (to buy drugs - but no one really knows that, either - EVEN if the NSA knows that they were used to buy drugs, they don't know who owns address B. They can assume that it might have been you, because once upon a time you owned those coins, but there is absolutely no way to prove that you owned address B.)
Sending coins through multiple addresses increases anonymity.

Theoretically, the value of a bitcoin has the sky as its limit. The reasonable ranges include anything from $10,000 to $3mil per coin, depending on how widespread use becomes.

Yes, we do. Paypal has to verify the bank account by making two small deposits (less than a dollar) and then you have to enter the amount into Paypal's verification system. This process takes a few days by itself, because deposits typically don't show up until two business days after they are deposited (3 days if you started the process after banking hours). If you did this on a Friday afternoon, you could be waiting until Wednesday just to confirm your bank account.

Refunds would be done either in dollars or the dollar equivalent of bitcoins at current prices. This is how most people that currently accept bitcoin offer refunds. It makes sense to most people.
Also, if they used a payment processor (like BitPay or Coinbase, for example), they wouldn't have to wait for any confirmations. The processor takes on the double-spend risk.

I was talking to an important person (decision maker) at a major utility in Pennsylvania after a meeting I had with them. He had been talking about innovations and making things easier for customers (automation of payment arrangement requests, ease of use of their website, etc.) during the meeting. I decided to ask him if they would consider accepting bitcoin. I was ready to start listing the benefits, but before I could he blushed and smiled and told me that they had been discussing it during the past week. He seemed very excited and started talking about how incredible the technology is and how much potential it has.
So, yeah... I was just really excited at the prospect of having a major utility accept bitcoin for payment. I am especially excited because it is actually the electric distribution company that serves my home, so I would be able to pay for my electric with bitcoin if it works out. Some people were comparing my "announcement" to that of the Starbucks "hoax"...

Okay, so what if swiping your card at a terminal logs you into a blockchain.info-like service. You still have to enter your PIN at the terminal to approve the transfer, but your private key is not exposed to anything except the terminal itself. When you swipe the card, it downloads your encrypted wallet from the service. Entering the PIN decrypts the wallet and allows you to access your funds. A message is displayed with your balance, your address, the requested amount, and the requestor's address. "Is this okay?" "Yes" Transaction complete. You wouldn't have to trust that the merchant hasn't modified the code on his terminal to store your key because you card creates a hash and verifies that the code is unchanged from the original... Or something.

Yes. Well, actually, it's a wallet. A wallet can contain many addresses. They start you off with one. You can create as many as you like. Each address corresponds to it's own public and private keys. The public key is kept secret until you spend the input, and the private key is ALWAYS kept secret. If anyone knows your private key, they can spend the inputs on your address.

But why would they assume everyone is going to sell when it's perfectly fine to use as a currency? Something really bad have to would happen, like the discovery of a serious flaw in the protocol. Yes, *investors* and *traders* will sell, but those that understand the protocol and its potential will not trade out for USD because they know the system works.

... None of them are marked as double-spends anymore. Earlier, when I was going through those transactions, each one that I clicked was marked as a double-spend by blockchain.info. They are no longer marked as such. How is this possible? Maybe blockchain.info was just acting weird?

That's correct. People come to me and say they heard these stories. Then, I give them an even BETTER story involving spending bitcoins in a bitcoin economy, and how it could change the world. A light bulb goes on, they have a "holy shit" moment, and they start proselytizing like the world's about to end. These people want to spend bitcoins in a bitcoin economy. They are going to the people that have been blabbering about it for months/years and asking *them* the questions that the media can't answer. And they are getting the answers that will make this thing work.
Edit: The small amount of investment advice I do often give is to put what you can into it as an investment (nothing crazy, nothing that you will miss), and then put that on a paper wallet and set it aside for years. Then, to protect the investment, buy bitcoins and spend them at every opportunity. People understand this.

You don't need to "sign up" for a wallet. You can generate wallets yourself. See [here]( for an example. If you can meet up with someone that owns bitcoins, you can just acquire some from them, either by offering a service, goods, or simply exchanging currency.

Everyone understands completely why it is so important, and all of them have said that they are going to start asking everyone if they can pay with bitcoin, and be paid with bitcoin. It's working.

I feel like they have a lot of incentive. If they can use a service like BitPay to accept bitcoins and pay them in USD with a 0.99% fee, why wouldn't they? They use PayPal which has what? 3-5% fees plus $0.30 on every transaction? Or VISA/MasterCard which may even cost more? By offering BitPay as a payment option, they still get their USD that they want, and they pay less for doing so. That's HUGE.

If you don't have any right now I would suggest that you do it. If the value keeps rising your hundred fifty dollars will have a lot more impact right now. (Win-win) If the value falls, you will lose some of your initial investment, but will have the opportunity to recover that investment by buying bitcoins at a cheaper price. (Win-lose) If you don't buy now, and the value rises, you will have no bitcoins and they will be harder to acquire (lose-lose). If you don't buy now, and the value drops, then nothing happens at all (boring)

No, this has been discussed. There would likely be a Marscoin and a Sapcecoin. Marscoin would behave similarly to Bitcoin, but Spacecoin would have a long confirmation time (days) because of the distance information has to travel between planets.

Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be. The fact is, in a bitcoin world, taxes will be *voluntary*. A lot of people see this as a huge win for humanity. Rather than being forced at threat of jail to hand over money (basically armed robbery), people will be able to choose what programs they want to support with their own money. To each his own, I say.

Except, what happens if the price of BTC goes to $500 next month? Are you really still going to expect people to pay 1 BTC for a Trezor? You are supposed to set the price of your product at the value of your product. If the value of the accepted currency is fluctuating, then your price needs to fluctuate.

From their website:


Also, oops! I funded my bitcointip wallet, because I knew it was empty - however, I accidentally sent it to my alt-account's bitcointip wallet. Now I have to wait for confirmations before I can send it to the right one. I really need to pay more attention when I'm doing things like this, haha. Regardless, I'll make sure you get some (as soon as I fix what I did), because, if nothing else, playing with bitcoins makes you appreciate how useful they could potentially become.

Takes about as long to send money via paypal as it does bitcoin, but it is still more convenient for me to spend bitcoin, for reasons other than time.
Took about a week to get my first bitcoin, yes. That's what I'm saying, though. There's no time-advantage in signing up with PayPal vs bitcoin. Once you have it though, the time is a sunk cost.

They said they were working on incorporating a tumbler, which is why they froze withdrawals... If they are tumbling the coins, doesn't that make sense? Are we sure they are running away with the money?

There are both cloud- and device-based wallets. Bitcoin for Android is a device-based wallet for Android devices, bitcoin-qt is the original client for PCs. There are lighter PC clients like Multibit and Electrum, too. Or you could go the easy route and use an online wallet like blockchain.info - make sure to use a strong password and two-factor authentication if you do this, for security and peace of mind. There is also a blockchain.info Android app so you can spend your coins from your PC or your phone.

Collective force *is* government. By establishing willingness to collectively use force for whatever scenario *is* an establishment of government. Just because that's not what they're calling it, doesn't change what it actually is.

My understanding is that orphaned blocks are initially accepted by the majority of the network, but are later rejected when proof of a longer blockchain is received that doesn't include that particular block.
This means that a user could see a transaction as having one confirmation and then, if a longer blockchain was received that didn't include the transaction, it could change back to 0 confirmations. 
This would happen more often with shorter confirmation times.

It's actually very different from most web-based wallets. They don't actually keep your keys for you. They keep an *encrypted* copy of your wallet. This means that when you type your ID into the sign-in box, the encrypted wallet is downloaded to your computer. Then, when you type the password, your wallet is decrypted *on your computer*. Blockchain.info doesn't keep a copy of your keys, so they can never spend your money. Even if they get hacked, the hackers won't be able to spend your money unless they have your password (which is *not* stored on Blockchain's servers).
It's a very good compromise between convenience and security.
Edit: *If* they get hacked and the attackers change the javascript so that your password is sent to the hackers when you type it in (instead of decrypting locally), then I suppose you could get your money stolen. There is a Chrome app that will detect javascript changes to the website, however.

I've used it a few times. I always check what the current rate is at the time I make the purchase. I check to see, minus fees, how many coins I should be getting. So, if, minus fees, I should be getting 2 coins AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, I will get 2 coins when I put the moneygram through, regardless of the current exchange rate. So, if the price goes down between the time I order and the time I do the moneygram, bitinstant will still purchase 2 coins, but it is simply worth less usd. They don't spend all of my money on it, but I do get the 2 coins that I should have gotten. Does this make sense? It's always worked that way for me.

If you want some copy-pasta, I've used this a couple times, updating numbers and tailoring it a bit to whomever I'm talking to.
Bitcoin is a new, decentralized form of money.
First, a little on where the money comes from:
Instead of banks creating the money from nothing, at the will of world governments, the money is "mined" by a network of decentralized computers (you could run one if you wanted!) that compete to solve complex math problems. The computer that solves the problem (about once every 10 minutes) wins a reward of 25 bitcoins (this reward is halved every 4 years until a maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins are mined in the year 2140). Because it can take a long time to find a solution to one of these problems on your own (possibly over a year) people join mining pools, similar to an office lottery pool, where when one finds a solution, they all share in the reward, based on how much work their computer did.
The purpose of all of this math work is to verify transactions and secure the network, so that we can trust it without having to worry about people feeding false information to the network. (i.e. transactions cannot be faked and the money cannot be counterfeited.)
Once a miner has these bitcoins, they can hold onto them, exchange them for another currency, or spend them directly. Right now the exchange rate is ~$**XXX**USD/BTC. Because of the relatively small market size (~$1.**X** billion), this exchange rate is pretty volatile. For the past week it's seen anywhere between $**XXX**-$**XXX** per coin. As the market grows, the value of a bitcoin will grow, and eventually this will stabilize. However, due to the built-in scarcity, the value of bitcoins will rise over time even without additional user adoption. This is due to simple supply and demand economics.
Bitcoins are really easy to transfer from person to person, and it is super simple to accept bitcoins [as a merchant](
All you really have to know is that when I say +tip **XXX** mBTC verify, you are recieving 0.00**X** bitcoin that is worth about **XX** cents right now. You can hold onto it as an investment, or you can spend it at any number of online stores that accept bitcoin. There are [many]( You can even go ahead and [gamble]( with it. Or maybe buy someone (or yourself!) a gift card with [Gyft](

@_date: 2013-09-09 14:04:55
No, because currently, the production and movement of money is very centralized. On top of that, we have this stupid debt-based economy that doesn't work. What the housing market does is sell debt, not houses. If all of this could be decentralized, first the money, then the market, then absolutely.

There is a hard limit of 21,000,000. Every 4 years, inflation decreases by half. So, right now, there are 25 bitcoins going into circulation every 10 minutes. In 2016, that will halve to 12.5 coins, etc. until the year 2140 when the 21 millionth and final coin is mined. This cannot change without more than half of the network agreeing to the change. It's sound, democratic money.

I understand that. Where does the bank get that money that they are paying?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:01:56
It makes people feel like they have money. If someone is living off of a fraction of a coin, it makes them feel poor. Nobody wants to feel poor.
It's not about being a "get rich quick" investor. It's about someone feeling like they actually have something valuable to use as currency.
I have a friend that has become obsessed with bitcoin over the past few weeks and loves everything about it. When I showed him how to change the denomination in Mycelium he was overjoyed. He said "Wow! It looks like I actually have money now!!" So, even though he was satisfied before, seeing a larger number in his wallet had a positive psychological effect.
If we want it to succeed as a currency, it is a change that needs to take place sooner, rather than later.

This is the second post today of someone complaining that a transaction took too long to go through. One post is someone transacting from an exchange account, and yours is because you transacted from another betting website. Don't send transactions to people (especially 10 fucking bitcoins) from a wallet you have no control over. I don't even send from my Coinbase wallet because it takes a god awful amount of time.
Always, always transact from a wallet you control. I feel bad for you, but this was your fault, not BitBet's.

This is where it all falls apart for you. I don't need to extract it in the form of USD. I can give it to a merchant and they will give me a product. For example, I could go to a local arts and crafts show and buy a painting for 0.5 bitcoin. When people accept it as a currency, actual value is created, not simply transferred.
Edit: I responded before reading your whole post. I see you pointed that out in your last paragraph. However, I certainly could do any one of those things in BTC - getting paid (there are companies that offer to pay a portion of salary in bitcoins), buying products (plenty of products I can purchase with bitcoins), getting a home (I saw at least a few on craigslist, and at least one company that offers rentals for bitcoins), etc.

3. Get a computer that you are sure is 100% free of keyloggers/viruses/spyware and this is not plugged into a network. The reason people suggest using a live CD is because you can be sure that it hasn't been compromised (you have an opportunity to compare the cryptographic signature of the .iso file that you personally burned to disc, and any viruses or spyware never get a chance to report back to their owner and are destroyed when you turn off the computer - this is to ensure ultra-security), but it isn't absolutely necessary - a trusted offline computer works, however that computer should never ever be connected to the internet again.
4. Insert the flash drive and open the website that you copied.

I'm a policy analyst with a state regulatory commission. What I do is pretty much the same as what a compliance auditor would do. As an utilty complaints investigator, I used to investigate reports where utilities may not be in compliance with regulations, identify those areas, and then issue citations. Now as an analyst, I develop tools to assist those investigators in performing their jobs more efficiently. 
Regardless, I work with government regulations all the time. I'm able to write functional code. I am passionate about bitcoin.

You know, I'm planning on doing something similar AFK. I've printed business cards with 5 mBTC blockchain.info QR claim codes on them, along with a little bit of info about what bitcoins are, and the weusecoins.com URL. I'm planning on doing a "teach-in" at a monthly "Really Really Free Market" event that pretty much attracts the Occupy crowd and a bunch of anarchists and libertarians - along with a handful of passersby. I will hand out the cards there to anyone that wants them, along with a few paper wallets printed from bitcoinpaperwallet.com that I am using for demonstration purposes to those that seem the most interested. The cool thing about using the blockchain.info claim code for the QR is that if the funds aren't accepted in a month or so, I can just sweep the coins back to one of my addresses.

You can send bitcoins to *any* valid address, even if the private key is unknown. In that case, they would sit there forever, inaccessible to anyone. In your case, you already had the address AND the private key, but your wallet didn't have the public ledger (block chain) available yet, so it was unaware that there was a balance on your address. I hope that helped you understand.
Edit to clarify: You don't actually have bitcoins on your machine - you have a copy of the public ledger known as the block chain, and the private key to a bitcoin address. The coins *only* exist within the ledger itself. To move coins from one address to another, the sender needs to know the private key associated with the sending address. Then he is able to sign a transaction that associates the coins with the recieving address.

You are correct. In fact, you are both correct. DCA absolutely will not increase your gains. In fact, it will decrease your gains. **However**, it is VERY successful at reducing exposure to volatility. People that DCA usually only do so in order to reduce exposure to volatility, so it absolutely works as intended.
*For example*: I take $100-200 USD every time I get paid (every two weeks) and convert that to BTC. This is all I can afford, and is an example of DCA. Because of this, and due to the fact that I actually spend my bitcoins fairly regularly, the volatility of BTC has not affected me one bit since I started investing.

What I did was took the most money I was able to afford at the time (about $100) and invested it into Bitcoin earlier this year. Then, figure out what you normally spend dollars on, and see if you can spend bitcoins on that instead. Every time you get paid, convert some of your income to bitcoins, and get the things that you would normally be spending your money on. Gyft helps with this a lot, because they have target/k-mart/etc. gift cards. Bitcoinshop.us has a lot of household items (and toys if you have kids). But, basically, invest what you can afford (set it aside), and then buy/spend on the things you would normally get (and maybe save what you don't end up spending, since it will grow). The act of buying and spending bitcoins will help to protect and improve your investment.
I used to live paycheck-to-paycheck. I now have money to enjoy myself *and* I have savings!

Wow.... Possibly.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:45:58
Actually, I have a lot of incentive to spend them. Before buying bitcoins, I was living paycheck-to-paycheck. I've been buying bitcoins since April, spending (as I normally would have, on everyday items) as the price goes up, and saving what I have left over. I never had savings before bitcoin. I am able to buy things that I've never been able to buy before. I was able to send you a $10 tip. As long as I save SOME money, I am free to do with the rest of my money whatever I wish. I believe it is called "the wealth effect".
Maybe, if you're already wealthy, you have no incentive. But, poor people love bitcoin.
If it crashes (which seems unlikely), then so what? I'm back to where I was before bitcoin.

The sender always pays the fee, so you shouldn't have to worry about them losing out on the fees. I've been giving away 5 mBTC. One reason I like the blockchain.info method is that as soon as they scan the barcode, it gives them the option of logging into their existing blockchain.info wallet to add the funds, or creating a new wallet. They don't have to download anything, and if they toss it in the trash because they don't understand it, the money doesn't get lost, you can simply reclaim it.
The "normal" transaction fee on blockchain.info is 0.0002, which almost guarantees it gets confirmed within 10 minutes, but you can adjust it if you want to. Again, the *sender* always pays the fee. So you really shouldn't have to worry about that. :)

No, because only the longest chain will ever be accepted as valid. Changing the chain takes computational time.

If I'm not planning on hammering anything, why in the world would I use a hammer??? I don't own a drill. If I ever need to use a drill, I will go buy one, with *my* money. *In the near future*, the cell phone issue will be moot, because there will be hardware wallets that do not rely on internet or even need to be charged. The issue with banks arbitrarily locking up your money will *not* be solved in the near future. I never carry cash unless absolutely necessary. My checks are deposited directly into my bank account, and I don't want to bother with ATMs unless I have to. *Most* of the time, it is simply too inconvenient. Bitcoin is perfect for *my* needs, and apparently, the needs of many others. If you don't feel this way, then just don't use the currency. I really don't care.

So much this. My 7 year old saw me playing Satoshi Circle and asked what I was doing. I explained it to him and he seemed interested. I gave him 100 millibits and let him go crazy.

He said it was good because you have a chance of winning a lot of money, but bad because you will probably lose all of it instead.

The point? What's the point of accepting VISA? You trade in credit just so you can sell in fiat.
If you are just using it as a payment processor, it SAVES you money on every sale. You are protected from volatility by immediately exchanging for dollars, and there is no risk of chargebacks or fraud. Not to mention the almost non-existent fees. For merchants, bitcoin payment processors beat any other payment processor hands down.
Personally, I am not delusional and I simply think the technology is amazing. I don't care about the moon.

It's provably fair. And here's how.
Suppose you and I want to bet on a coin toss. You will guess “heads” or “tails”; I will flip the coin; if you guess right, you win $1; if you guess wrong, you lose $1.
 
Oh, one more thing: We will play this game over the phone.
 
Ready? Go.
 
 
“Sorry, it was tails. You lose. Try again.”
 
 
“Oh, sorry, that time it was heads. You lose. Try again.”
 
After you lose like this a few hundred times in a row, you start to get suspicious.
 
Is it possible for two untrustworthy people, like you and me, to play this game fairly? By the power of the [one-way function]( it is! Here is how. First, we agree on a one-way function f. Then I flip a coin. If the coin lands “tails”, I pick a big even number. If it lands “heads”, I pick a big odd number. Call that number x. Then I compute y=f(x) and tell you y. Then you guess “heads” or “tails”. Then, finally, I reveal x.
 
Since you cannot invert f(x), you have no idea whether x is even or odd at the time you make your guess. And since I cannot invert f either, you can check the x I revealed simply by confirming that f(x)=y. Thus we have flipped a coin over the phone fairly, even if both of us would rather cheat.

It's a bit more than that. It's also the fact that these strings of code cannot be counterfeited and cannot be destroyed that makes them valuable. It's also the fact that they are distributed at a predictible rate, and in a decentralized manner that makes the valuable. For example, an mp3 can be copied and recopied, so they are not so valuable - in fact, people pirate them all the time and don't even feel like they are stealing anything. Bitcoin is very, very different - it's not just a string of code. Another thing that makes them valuable is that you don't have to trust anyone to know that all of the transactions in the blockchain are accurate. Everything is independantly verifiable.

I usually have them install a local wallet on their phone (Bitcoin Wallet or Mycelium, for example), and then send them a dollar, just to show them how it works. I start explaining what bitcoin is and how it can affect the global economy. As we are talking they usually notice the value go up or down -- they usually ask about this, so I show them the charts. They ask about volatility, I explain, they understand. Then I explain that the wallet on their phone holds the keys to moving their money. I explain that they should back up their keys. I explain to never keep a lot of money in a spending wallet. I explain how to create secure wallets offline if they want to set some money aside as an investment. I explain blockchain.info and how they offer a convenient wallet without compromising too much security. I warn that if they use a wallet like this, that they have to worry about viruses/keyloggers/javascript injections, etc. so again, not to store too much money in a wallet like this. They usually ask a lot of questions so I get to be very specific. Most people I talk to are mostly just fascinated with the concept that they don't have to use dollars to pay for things, and they don't seem to care that it can lose value, because they don't have much money anyway -- they feel that the money they are currently using is already losing so much value LONG-TERM that the short-term losses in bitcoin are well compensated for by the long-term gains.

You probably don't want to keep money in Coinbase, because they have full control over your private keys. It's great for buying/selling, but if you need an online wallet, use Blockchain.info's wallet. It gives you full control over your keys - they don't even know anything about your private keys because they are generated client-side.
A paper wallet is just a paper backup of your private key. You can generate a keypair locally, print it out, and send bitcoins to it. Then, if you wanted to spend/sell the bitcoins, you would have to transfer that private key to a client (either local or web wallet) before you can spend them..

Using XRP as a medium of exchange. It goes Currency -&gt; XRP -&gt; Currency.
Let's say Yen -&gt; XRP -&gt; BTC
If I change it to Yen -&gt; Dollar -&gt; BTC, what has changed?
That's right. The exchange currency. They are basically IOUs of little value that are used to facilitate exchange of two different currencies. There is no reason why someone couldn't use them as a currency in their own right.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:33:23
Yeah, but they are speculating that it will be used wide-spread. I think a lot of the people buying in are in it for the long-run, for whatever motives they might have. I'm also sure there are a number of people trying to do some mini pump-and-dumps, but overall, that doesn't matter. If they keep doing it over and over, they will realize that they would be better off buying and holding, which increases the value of the currency for those that choose to use it as such.

Okay, I see what you are saying, but what is preventing miners (and others) from funding the machines with bitcoins themselves, remotely (or locally)? And then local people come with cash to buy bitcoins. They can have accounts they control with an app on their phone. They can set buy orders with cash they deposited in the ATM. Then, the people funding the machines with bitcoins can pick up the cash at any local ATM. 
I understand that this doesn't currently happen, but it does seem viable, correct?
No banks at all.
Edit: Just thought of something. If there is not enough cash in the machine (probably will happen quite a bit at first), they would have the option to get a gift card or something.

We'll be giving away millibits, we'll be teaching people about bitcoin at the location, we'll teach security practices, do paper wallet demonstrations, etc. And obviously, we'll be helping people purchase bitcoin (so they can spend it at the local merchants that we will be encouraging!).

The same number of bitcoins exist now (more or less) as a few hours ago. The protocol hasn't changed, and it still works beautifully. People are losing their shit because an exchange is out of order. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself. If you thought it was a good investment when you bought in, it's still a good investment. If you bought in because you were trying to "get rich quick," or "play the market," you're gonna have a bad time.

I am very capable of explaining anything that they might ask, but I feel like my unbridled enthusiasm needs to be scaled back a bit before anyone will take me seriously. I've been working on my pitch with a few friends - we've been working on pamphlets (both for the merchants and their customers) - we've been working on more professional presentations for larger interested parties. We actually have a bar/restaurant chain with a dozen locations that's looking to expand to 40 some locations in the northeast that is really interested in it - however, they won't be ready until January, because they are focused on the expansion deal...
I'd really like to know any details that you could share with me as far as plans on how you are going about doing this. Anything would be helpful including letting me know about failures.

The biggest argument seems to be that they'll never be as widely accepted as Bitcoin. But, let's say some payment processor decides to enable consumers to pay with any cryptocurrency they choose, and the merchant recieves whatever cryptocurrency *they* choose (this could be done automatically through an exchange similar to Cryptsy).
For example, I go to the store and pay for my goods with Dogecoin, but the merchant receives payment in Bitcoin (or Litecoin, or whatever his preference is).

@_date: 2013-03-30 21:16:27
Because the value exists as long as people are willing to buy it. And people will continue to buy it as long as the value exists. This creates stability and allows merchants to have faith in the system. The government can't confiscate your money (like what happened in Cyprus) and the money can't be manipulated by bankers.

The numbers are not useless themselves. They can be used as proof-of-ownership stored in a trustless distributed decentralized database. And, the only way the database can exist is if the currency has value, because if the currency becomes worthless, there will be no more miners, the network will no longer be secure, and there will be no more database. This database (block chain) is VERY useful, therefore the currency must be VERY valuable. 
It's not about you. Just because you have no use for a distributed consensus network doesn't mean that a lot of other people don't.
Personally, I don't need collectibles or jewelry.
tl;dr Bitcoin is two things, a currency and a protocol. The currency is backed by the protocol. Don't forget that.
Edit: Why am I being downvoted? Bitcoin has plenty of other uses than as currency, and the currency is necessary for the network to exist.

Both. They are valuable today because they do not rely on a central bank or any central authority, and I know that they will increase in value over time, thus making it a sound investment. I am going to continue converting the same amount of USD into BTC every payday, and using it as currency at every opportunity I can. I plan on lobbying as many merchants as possible to accept bitcoin so that I can use them and increase their utility so that other people adopt them as their preferred currency, thus further increasing the value. I am not creating a bubble. I am enabling a currency.

Not capisce. That's what fractional reserve banking *is*. Banks can lend out real dollars that they don't have. Banks can lend out real bitcoins they don't have. Banks can lend out real gold they don't have. What other kind of fractional reserve banking is there?

Wow. This seems really easy. I bet I could make lots of bitcoins by scamming people. Can you guys help me think of a good scam?

Yes. As long as it doesn't give out USD, it's just like a vending machine. Also, I can see these being useful if you want to open a brick &amp; mortar business that ONLY accepts Bitcoin.

He called $400 billion the **small** bull estimate. So, he's saying that's worst case scenario. lol
@_date: 2013-05-14 19:11:42
I kind of thought everyone realized that was the plan. You get it early, you get to test it, you get to develop for it, and you get to pay a lot of money that goes towards subsidizing the consumer model. If I had the money at the time, I would have done it, even knowing that the consumer model would have been much cheaper.

We're not blindly ignoring it. In fact, it's not even a new theory. It's just suggesting that a large pool can attract neutral parties so that they can do a 51% attack. Except, no rational party will stay in a pool that large, and the supposedly selfish miner would actually gain more by not attacking.

Also, here is an example of the cards I've created. Keep in mind that I designed this with a bunch of anarchist, libertarian, Occupy people in mind. 
Note: The private key "sample" is obviously invalid, so there is nothing to claim in this example.
Edit: You can give away any amount stored in a private key in this way, just by converting  into a QR code. To accept it, blockchain.info either creates a new wallet or lets them move the funds to their own existing blockchain.info wallet.

Isn't bitcoin a protocol that not only acts as a currency and commodity, but also as a decentralized bank?
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:26:48
Yes, but the point is, right now you don't have to trust ANYONE. All you have to do is trust math. Not math + a foundation.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:53:32
They would spend millions upon millions to destroy the network and get nothing in return.
Edit: Also, more likely, a country like Iran, Israel, China, etc. will start mining. Other countries will notice this and start freaking out and begin mining, themselves. At that point it will literally be an arms race and who knows what will happen. Welcome to the potential future of wars.

Save bitaddress.org's HTML to a clean flash drive. Burn a copy of F4UBCD and boot up using it. That way you can use MiniXP instead of Linux to make your paper wallet. If Windows is more comfortable for you to work in, this will work for you.

Right, but I'm saying they could outlaw the sale of ASIC bitcoin mining computers (or whatever the equivalent is at the time). It doesn't matter because I actually agree with it that it would be next to impossible to outlaw this, but I guess it's better to be prepared than not.

Because it contributes to the drop and reduces confidence, which contributes to the drop more, and slows growth.

Believe me, if it dips to $10, people will start pumping money back into the system, banking on the fact that it will likely rise back up again. As long as you don't sell because of a dip, you shouldn't lose much, if anything. Plus, you'll make out on anything that you buy while it's at $10, so you'll likely gain.
