I agree, it's really obnoxious when a bunch of people go around calling themselves something that they're not.
Like, this one time? Back in 2015? This bunch of assholes called "Blockstream" started bribing all the developers of bitcoin and turning it into shit, but they still called it "Bitcoin."  It was totally bogus. Nothing at all like what was described by Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper.
Now people are starting to see that Bitcoin is back, even if it goes by "Bitcoin Cash" on most exchanges, and they're calling the other deformed monstrosity "Bitcoin Core" or "Segwit Coin" or if they're being really honest: Shitcoin.

I have not been impressed with bitcoinstore.com. I bought a printer last summer on bitcoinstore.com because I wanted to make the purchase with bitcoin.  The printer was exactly what I wanted and the transaction went smoothly but I noticed the price was higher than on Amazon (didn't check newegg). Also, I'm now looking at buying 4TB internal hard drives... and bitcoinstore.com doesn't seem to carry them at all.
On the other hand, Overstock.com seems to have just what I want. Guess who's going to get my business?

Floppy disks died about 10 years ago. Good luck changing what people expect a "save" icon to look like...

Data was taken from blockchain.info, and the dates there are those displayed on blockchain.info which is in UTC time (i.e. the time in Great Britain right now, probably not your local time zone unless you are in the UK). There are two charts -- one for total count of donations, the other the amount of donations.
They seem to be having a good day.
Note that I am not affiliated with Voat in any way. This is just a nice way to quantify disapproval with the reddit admins right now.

To be more precise [here is a link]( to blockchain.info donation address for voat, where I got the data.
Also worth noting: The data was taken at 2pm EDT (6pm UTC) 7/03/2015. As you might expect, that top bar (on both charts) is getting longer every minute...

U.S. Bank accounts are denominated in U.S. Dollars.  The Chinese government doesn't give a shit if a Chinese citizen deposits U.S. dollars into an account and converts it to Bitcoin.
What the Chinese government cares about is control over their own currency (RMB), specifically people who want to take wealth generated in China and denominated in RMB and converting it into something else. The Chinese government wants Chinese wealth to stay in China. Bitcoin was being used as a way around that: By buying Bitcoin with RMB (something that initially looked like someone purchasing an asset locally, not a currency conversion), people were converting RMB to something that could be transferred out of China. That did not make the Chinese government happy, so they did something about it.
