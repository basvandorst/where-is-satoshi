Whether it's the banks themselves or their obedience to the government the point is the same: the value of their currency is wholly controlled by a small group of people.
There is no narrative here, no spin; corrupt leadership within one country cannot cause hyperinflation of Bitcoin.
Bringing attention to the situation in Venezuela is only going to help them. They don't need to be mourned, they need to be freed.
This is the Bitcoin subreddit. We talk about and advocate for Bitcoin here. If Venezuela gets brought up and it's *not* about Bitcoin, the post will get deleted. We're mostly Bitcoin activists.

You're not wrong.
But the sentiment, I feel, is that the world will never ever begin to make the change towards Bitcoin without a large degree of social pressure. And it behooves a true enthusiast to be a part of that social pressure.
Now, whether or not that social pressure would ever come from first-world countries and middle-class speculators is another matter entirely.

You make the assumption that long-time hodlers are willing to buy fiat with their Bitcoin. I think that becomes less and less true with every new vendor that accepts it, and with each passing day.

I do this all the time. There's no way to unlink the address from your identity, so theres no point in worrying about that.
As far as security goes, there's no immediate threat unless someone with access to a quantum computer decides they want your money.
There are other security threats besides that, but they're small and the only thing at risk will the coin behind that address after the first time you spend from it. If you regularly send from that address to an unused address you'll be fine.
It wouldn't hurt to update the address on your YouTube videos after you spend from the latest one. If you make sure that your latest video always has an unused address on it you'll be gold.

He started construction on the large tower that would have been necessary--in theory-- but never finished it.
It wasn't the sort of thing he could have built in his back yard, and of course it was wireless energy *transmission,* but he still would have had to generate it somewhere.
I wouldn't call it a lie as much as a misunderstanding, or wishful thinking.

If it really were as easy as collecting free energy falling out of the sky and selling it to people, you can bet those "greedy corporations" would have been the first on the dogpile.
The fact of the matter is renewables just aren't as reliable, efficient, or available as traditional sources of power, which is why they're not used very much and only generate a very small percentage of the world's power.

Tesla theorized that he could do that. He never completed the research because his funding was pulled by people that lacked the creativity to profitize it.
By that point in Tesla's career he was slowly losing his mind and it's hard to say whether or not his research would have ever yielded results. As of today, we have not replicated his work on the subject.
Dont be brainwashed into thinking the world can run off of well wishes and back-pats.

Money isn't HODLed forever. Disincentivizing spending is a big step towards overthrowing debt culture, but eventually people always spend what's theirs to spend.

You can't own something until you get out of debt.
I completely understand your position on your house, it's logical, and to some degree I practice it myself.
But don't forget the flip side to your last sentence--you don't actually own your home until you pay every last cent. It's not your home yet. It still belongs to the bank.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:46:26
Every time someone posts one of these the debt culture apologists just *pour* out of the woodwork.
Working every day just so they won't take your home away is not the only way it can work. I cannot empathize at all with these people who assume it just couldn't possibly work any other way.
You know why you started with nothing? Because when your ancestors died they didn't leave their legacy behind for their children. The debt collectors came and took it away; it was never theirs to begin with.
There *is* a better way.

Just for future reference, it's illegal to put something in someone's mailbox if you're not the postman.
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:05:36
I don't usually say this on this sub, but I hope you're pulling out.
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:43:09
It does, and that's illegal too, but it's not a big deal.
I believe the idea is that people who get caught with their hands in someone else's mailbox can't claim they were personally delivering their own mail.
Along with a few other reasons, I suppose.

A system of different national currencies bears no resemblance to the barter system, not even the "blockchain enabled" version proposed in this article.
A currency can be traded for any good or service with any merchant that accepts it.
In a barter system, not everyone is interested in trading for certain goods or services. Within this magical blockchain version of barter, the different tokens (representing different goods or services) would have to be exchanged between some medium (presumably an underlying currency that would defeat the purpose) before a trade could be made.
I can't figure out what you're trying to say with that evolution statement. I'm not sure why you chose to include it.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:16:36
The second plan is incredibly stupid. *incredibly* stupid.
Going back to the barter system, even a very efficient one, would be a step back from the societal innovation of "money."
See, with "money" you have an abstraction of value, a *unit* of value you could say, that allows you to quickly and seamlessly assess and compare the value of different goods and services. No matter how easy it might be to trade your cReddit for McDollars it will always be more convenient and streamlined to just use currency. Always.

Why would you buy something if you dont understand what it is in the first place?
Normal people see folks running around trying to get rich from Bitcoin who can't even explain what it is.
When the people singing Bitcoin's praises actually understand the thing they're praising, outsiders can start to regard Bitcoin as something other than a get-rich-quick scam and a meme.
Then Bitcoin can start being used instead of mistrusted.
*Then* and only then moon, lambo.

"The Internet has a ton of shortcomings! I mean, yeah, they're all being addressed, but it does it work *right now?* Can you believe these idiots that think what this technology will be tomorrow is amazing in spite of the fact that what it is right now is lackluster?"
Dont let someone else's myopia convince you that what you're seeing isnt real. The internet still isnt perfect, but nobody can deny that it has shaped the world. For Bitcoin, we're just now heading in to 1995.

Man, I'm glad all these geniuses wandered in here to bitch and moan, and attempt to obfuscate the point:
That a disagreement over internal (or external) politics can not and will never shut the Bitcoin network down.
I wonder if there's a single person here who actually couldn't see the point he was making.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:20:28
Bitcoin's price correlates to gold: when the price of one goes up, so does the other. The implication is that people are starting to think about Bitcoin the same way they think about gold. They aren't valued the same, but the same things make them valuable in the minds of  more people.
Or at least, that's what I get from it.
