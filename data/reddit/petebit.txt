The strain on bandwidth at 2mb now would be less than that of dealing with 1mb 5 years ago, it's getting faster and cheaper domestically. Improvements by core has also had seen significant improvements to syncing ect.. Miners have all agreed 4mb would not be a problem to them. Regardless those responsible as you put it have already agreed to a relative 2mb requirement through SegWit, so you are clearly just be a divisive troll or brainwashed by tribal side taking. Either way should have no place in bitcoins future any more. Enough is enough.
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:54:28
We need both. Why is the debate at polar extremes? It makes no sense. Having short and longer term solutions would have been more positive for Bitcoin. It's a shame and has been the worst thing that's happened to Bitcoin in its short and crazy existence. I hope common sense prevails somehow through the toxic fog created most likely by those that gain most from bitcoins stalling. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 18:56:18
Those in 3rd world countries earn as much in a month as a Bitcoin transaction fee in busy periods. No I don't want that. I want people with an incentive in bitcoins value to run nodes. If that's over a few thousand the we are in good shape, SPV then will be great for those in the sticks or Outer Mongolia or those with no expertise or computer know how to run a node, open ports ect. Nobody should be priced out of transacting with Bitcoin. That's how it is sometimes now sadly. In most cases common sense should be applied in development! Instead of egos and agendas and conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2016-08-30 23:19:10
Blocksize increase by Hard Fork will allow more transactions, less congestion, lower fees and more adoption. The risk is a Hard Fork itself. Almost everybody agrees that the SegWit soft fork solution that achieves similar result plus more cool stuff is worth the complex change that's planned. Is it too little too late? Who knows.. Still much debate.. Much disagreement. Might get hard forked anyway, regardless of majority consensus. The plan by devs in control is SegWit then code for hard fork once it's deemed safer. That seems most likely.

I've used a few in UK, lost track of those that have UK banking, coinfloor had it lost maybe has it again, same with Up hold. Some have come and gone. Circle is far easiest/quickest and uses debit card, maybe 1% more for buy but is fair and sell is the same rate. I'd recommend circle.
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:05:49
I've read the White paper thanks. My point is why not allow double spend on 1 conf, to show its not safe. Maybe just make a conf every show after 2 blocks. Why not 3 or 4.. Detecting RBF requires more patches so it can't be a lie or a dumb lie if such a thing is possible.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:34:58
There are loads of great innovative use cases for 0 conf. Scan a qr code watch a tv show ect..they are doing it right and it works for them. Also systems to mitigate risk of 0 conf. If the merchant so chooses convenience over certainty. Shops in the UK accept convenience of just flashing your debit card next to terminal, even tho the security is terrible, just because it makes sense for lower value items. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:25:55
Well look on average the population that has access to fibre optic to door or nearby has shot up from 0. New houses in uk all have fibre to door or at least to junction box nearby. The core client has had some great advancements in terms of bandwidth and storage requirements, that you do have.  
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:04:07
Sidechains are not a silver bullet to scaling, still need space on main chain to go back and forth, lot of ifs with security and usability. Increasing Max blocksize a modest amount has no impact on bitcoins important properties. All layer 2 solutions are going to be needed tho, just as much as a strong and capable first layer on which they are built. It's most likely on chain is always going to be the most secure. Merged mining other chains is always going to be a trade off. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:18:15
It's not dangerous like you might die or get hurt just a chance it will be double spent. Like a debit or credit card. 1 conf is hardly safe for high value, why not protect people from that too. Or let people choose their own risk management. RBF just increases the risk and/or amount of complication in the already complicated Bitcoin world. You can like it if you want, I can like it a lot less.

Peter Todd should write the code to patch every wallet provider that it impacts. He created the attack vector he should sort it.
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:00:43
I'm not really being a doom merchant. Just hard to quantify where we would be without the congestion. Fee pressure is a symptom of the problem not a viable solution or measure of success, if bitcoins potential will be realised fee pressure will be minimal. In a perfect world we'd have enough space, at least until other measures and solutions were ready. Bitcoin can ride out most bumps tho, it's got a good track record of doing just that. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 08:46:21
Well 0 conf is a lot more dangerous now until all wallets are protected. Then the progress you speak of is in a congested unreliable network. Good job and il take my views where ever I like, or they can be censored and everything will seem great. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 17:35:31
I think only in hindsight will we know the effects. When the blocks are congested people stop using Bitcoin, transactions slowly reduce and all seems well. What we don't see clearly is if there wasn't a blocksize issue, how much more adoption and transactions the network would of reached.
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:18:57
I'm pretty sure the white paper Satoshi wrote was for peer to peer electronic cash. Just like paper cash it's for whatever people see fit to use it for. Defining what it should be or should not be is missing the point. Let it be..

Spoken like a true dictator, remember freedom of choice. Even RBF is opt-in. Your insults make you sound like an arrogant child, if you don't understand the benefits of accepting 0 conf for tiny value then fair enough.

I didn't have fibre 5 years ago, I do now. It costs me almost the same now for 5 times faster. That's not a guess.

Circle does have insurance tho, so unless your comfortable securing your bitcoins or the value is high it's a good option. Breadwallet for iOS is safe and simple. Trezor hardware wallet is the daddy and straightforward too.
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:06:53
USD deposits have FDIC insurance like a bank while Bitcoin deposits are secured against digital or physical hack at circles end by another company. Marsh an Mclenan or similar I think
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:54:20
Well dispute the headline as that what it calls it, the double spend risk with RBF around is at least 100 times more likely. RBF wouldn't exist if it was so trivial to double spend in the first place so wallets are more vulnerable to double spends. That's the fault of RBF and Peter Todd. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 21:53:28
Is the long term solution getting rid of servers and central points of weakness, maybe safe network when it's launched would be the ultimate. You already trade their proxy token :) hope you guys get back up soon anyway.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:00:44
I know this RBF debate is old and boring. I'm sure Peter Todd will Dev his next bad idea soon. For every 2 bad ideas he comes up with one good tho. For a developer to decide that a merchants business model is no good because it's not using confirmations on blockchain is not his or your call, just like a merchant accepting a check or EMV payment it's up to them to balance risk and reward. Convenience and security. With RBF the risk is higher or convenience is gone. That's just a shame even if all wallets are updated. When RBF is useful it will be when Bitcoin is failing thru congestion, hardly a positive innovation but not terminal so whatever.
@_date: 2016-04-09 09:50:04
Breadwallet hands down
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:42:08
Ok thanks for letting me see the light, how did Bitcoin survive without this incredible innovation for last 7 years. It's truly amazing merchant adoption wasnt halted by this huge flaw. You must be right tho, they were just all very lucky. Surprised I wasn't aware of all the complaints by users and merchants. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:35:52
When you do visit other Bitcoin sites on Reddit or other, it is amazing the dialogue, info and ideas that are sadly missing/censored from here. It's a lot like the North Koreans must feel if they ever got out of their country for a long weekend.

Nodes are getting less because they are not designed for lay person to run, they would reduce if blocks were half the size.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:23:26
Transactions that haven't guessed the magic miner fee will not get into a block ever. This is bad on so many levels. User experience, reliability and spam.
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:12:11
Well we agree to disagree. You claim it was known and inevitable that a fee market would arise so it's morally justified to create a fee market. I think we should find consensus on an increase in block space to prevent such a change. I think that's an acceptable expectation.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:45:43
Yay! If only we can get all the devs and community to agree on a logical compromise between blocksize and fee market 
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:22:21
That's not the point, just carry on not trusting them then. No needy destroy the function and create a tool for highest fee only gets confirmed
@_date: 2015-12-26 10:04:52
Liquid is a pay per month service. RBF and getting rid of priority is about forcing fees up so only the highest get in, the rest will never get in a block. SW creates the blocksize increase they needed for LN. Sidechains are a commercial project. Coincidence..
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:28:15
I was being sarcastic I hope. People relied on it only if it suited them, free choice and all that. There's a lot of people lately dictating what Bitcoin is and how they should use it. That's not cool. Anyway RBF is done now, little point arguing, everybody wallet will have to pretect against this new attack vector. Slowly but surely core is getting all the ducks in a row to make Bitcoin less attractive more expensive and less usable than their own profit creating solutions. Pay a membership fee for liquid type side chain perhaps. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:25:02
Trezor is a safe, bread wallet is wallet. I use both and it has to be the best combo, maybe coinkite multisig as a half-way house also. I don't think there's a better, safer and simpler way to be secure. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:47:43
Ye the stress test was a pain, perhaps it could of been improved perhaps your right. We don't know the consequences yet do we. If transactions just fail it would be as bad if not worse than slow spam congestion problems. Not straight forward solution I guess

People sending Bitcoin for the pre stress test recommended fee suffered. If that was the norm then yes people would side step Bitcoin and stick with venmo, it certainly wouldn't have been the perfect time to showcase Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:00:11
I'd point out that fees transitioning over block subsidy is a bit confused. The block subsidy reducing is to create deflation, which all things being equal creates greater value for that subsidy. If as logic dictates, value increase is equal to supply reduction then miner reward stays the same in fiat value. That's shown to be the case in fiat land, albeit with inflation.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:09:01
Fees are needed to prevent spam, not significant in slightest for miners rewards, only if blocks are full do we need a system of only the most desperate high paying users to be granted a transaction. It's worked without fee market for years and will for many more if we can scale it suitably. We have so many options is the problem 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:29:55
I think that's reasonable, although a decentralised network shouldnt push people to centralised solutions through congestion. So there's a balancing act. I understand priority wasn't just for free transactions, but fees that fell below the threshold required, sometimes easily done and helped confidence within the network. I think fees should always be paid tho, hopefully just as spam prevention.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:02:10

I'm no tech genius, far from it but have had no problems using and safely securing Bitcoin. Things like purse.io are being used by non technical people. Running a node, unlike wallets or exchanges like breadwallet and circle respectively have tackled user friendly issues. I for one would run a node if it was easy, I'm not put off by bandwidth, cpu or memory issues, that's simple to get.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:23:00
It's called economics. Supply and demand. If the amount of fiat currency in circulation doubles then prices double. It's called inflation. Bitcoin is deflationary so the opposite should happen. It's why Satoshi designed Bitcoin this way. Bitcoin has doubled in price in last 12 months nevermind 4 years. Fees will rise if the volume of transactions don't increase equally due to scaling issues more than adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:48:13
It was censorship resilient before at 35mb cap. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:56:29
On both counts depends on how it scales, an artificial fee market just stops adoption. Sure LN might be the better coffee buying solution. Price rising as subsidy reduces also makes fees less significant. All a fee market does is stop people using Bitcoin obviously. The inevitable you describe is accepting defeat instead of focusing on success.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:53:07
Ye and thanks for breadwallet! Its my favourite wallet/Bitcoin storage app. I'm aware and appreciative of the security measures, I understand most of them. I suppose physically having funds with you on phone is a risk from threat of violence/death..that's the only reason I would suggest not storing too much on your person. Keep up the amazing work anyway with breadwallet.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:08:52
I'm not advocating anything other than scaling consensus in some manner. Blocksize increase is changing one constant in code, it can't be very complicated anyway. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:56:27
If you looked at early source code you would see no limit. Then 1mb to fix a selfish mining prob. This was to be extended as needed. Gavin then stepped down, brought up the issue and all the debate has been about how much to increase. Even Peter Todd expected a small increase after HK scaling.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:05:27
This is the problem. What Bitcoin should be is never going to be agreed on, ever! That was the point of Jeff and Gavin's post. It was a massive mistake leaving the blocksize cap for people to decide and adjust later to solve an early problem. If we can return it to hard coded rules like suggested then we can overcome all the other hurdles with unity. Anyone saying what it should change to, even by no action, is putting Bitcoin and all its achieved so far at risk.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:09:34
Or just raise the block size and carrie on as usual until we have new ways of scaling. Why create economic earthquake when we still have a good shot at success. Bitcoin can scale it just takes time, LN Sidechains SW IBLT and things not thought of yet.  Raise the block size a little will go a long way. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:28:30
Ye I agree, Software or decentralised protocols have never been developed before. No leader or decision maker makes difficult decisions hard to get decisions on :) BIP 101 is the only one that's been tested thoroughly enough to deploy. It still will take 75% agreement to activate but if there's a way of reaching consensus through dialog then being open, direct, honest, respectful  and patient sounds like the way forward.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:07:43
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:41:52
It was the developers that came up with this solution of priority space in the first place. In fact it was Gavin's solution that Satoshi was impressed with. My opinion from observing people freak out about transactions not confirming, but knowing it soon will thanks to priority is valid and reassures people to the realiability of the network.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:09:04
Sign up for circle, jump through the hoops with ID and linking bank card. Check out coinkite multisig on desktop and use all 3. It's a great mix of security, simplicity and convenience. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:23:18
A block size increase has always been the plan, even the core devs were resigned to a small increase. Sure it was possible fees will rise in 10/20 years but not artificially like is possible now. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:56:30
That's semantics. That double spend tool is RBF. People are able to choose what's acceptable risk for 0 conf. What's next stop 1 conf because it's a mistake to teach people that's safe for high value too.. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:54:06
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:03:07
I'm all for spam deterrent fees. And yes I agree maybe all Bitcoin can be us gold 2.0. It can't be a payment network with a fee market at least not a reliable one. A fee market may well cause the mining collapse. Miners don't need fees because a Bitcoin is valuable, if frictionless cheap transactions makes up a relevant part of that value then miners and us all are in trouble.
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:00:17
Going round in circles here. 0 conf is accepted and used for such amazing utility, optionally and by free choice. You don't like it don't trust it. That's called free choice. It's the fee market consequences that it's really gunning for.  Fees that would make a liquid type layer necessary. Not liquid itself. LN doesn't exist and has major problems, it's been redesigned and still not a solution worth going all in on like core hope too. No need for childish insults also btw. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 11:03:55
It's almost as if core have a vision of fee markets, small blocks and people having to use alternatives to thee blockchain for their financial gain...oh wait

Valid point and let's hope your right.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:49:57

@_date: 2015-12-27 23:02:24
2140 is entirely transaction fees. That's based on at that time 35mb blocks with over a hundred years of scaling solutions to go. Does not mention a fee market, just being able to handle such a high volume of fees that they transition. Block reward increases in value as it reduces in supply which is the idea of deflation. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:50:17

@_date: 2015-12-21 23:59:59
I've always been in favour of a block size increase and slightly sceptical of core/blockstream agenda. However I also agree decentralisation is bitcoins greatest virtue. This sounds like a roadmap we can compromise on and see if it delivers on scaling and decentralisation, if not there's little excuse or reason not to hard fork to bigger blocks. Most of all id like to see the community and devs including Gavin all work towards the goal of Bitcoin reaching its potential, while views will often differ, it's a process that's important in bitcoins nature and perhaps we can all learn from it and move forward. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:17:00

I think the plan is to use SW then get better propagation tools like IBLT, weak blocks then hard fork 2-4-8 potentially

If adoption increases fees increase. Educate yourself. It's competition to get transactions into a 1mb block that is responsible for artificial fee pressure. If price doubles every halving of subsidy then fees don't rise. It's scaling that needs to equal adoption increase. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:06:51
I don't understand what you mean by null or not null. His point is valid and I agree. As for the philosophy of debating, my point is to remember you are not your argument, leave egos out of it. I understand that the opposing view (fee market, settlement layer) is a possibility. I just think we have so many other options before we give up and say it's the only way. Let's at least try and scale it so we can let it play out, raise block size a bit with out damaging decentralisation and at least know for sure it has to be other layers we are pushed onto.
As for your other points Bitcoin has always been about democratic consensus. Sure it's good it's hard to change protocol, and ideally the vast majority would be in consensus for any change, but it only requires a majority. So let's hope we get better at compromise to find consensus. And let's hope it's not for egos, commercial agendas but what's best for this amazing technology to change the world for the better. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:19:34
Not just Americans, as an exchange it's an important player but as a wallet or place to store and use bitcoins it's not significant and not an advised option.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:43:58

Ye what infighting, I'v been on r/Bitcoin for a while and am not aware of any differing opinions. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:17:53
They don't hide their agenda, blockchain as a settlement layer with their services running intop, LN and sidechains. That's what every change and lack of is for. They admit it's a commercial agenda too. I'm not important enough to have agenda other than the success of Bitcoin and its blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:50:02
A fee market means only the people able or willing to pay the highest fee will get a transaction included, unless scaling solutions happen. The fee market is artificial because miners don't need the fees and a simple short term blocksize/space increase prevents the auction in first place. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 08:54:53
The core devs mostly work for blockstream, that's not independent. Blockstream have a clear agenda
@_date: 2015-12-05 10:59:59

@_date: 2015-12-16 19:37:10
"Criminal" is not literal meaning. And I'm sure it's his genuine opinion and the vast majority of community. I think his point is deciding to give up on the promise or potential of Bitcoin to make it a settlement layer for core Dev commercial projects is not, just, fair or what the community want or think is appropriate at this time. Although I agree it has always been a possible outcome and the protocol is and has been capped at 1mb favouring status quo, which ironically equals big change, which is blockstreams gain and bitcoins blockchain loss.
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:36:02
I decided on trezor, simple safe and very happy with it.
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:28:39
Possibly although blocksize will be doubled in a relative sense in 3-6 months with SW that might buy enough time. I don't think the majority will accept a fee market disruption for long, so either way Bitcoin shall be scaled.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:58:40
Then Bitcoin now is an alt coin by that logic. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:52:18

Doesn't mention a fee market/auction. Satoshi had planned for Bitcoin to scale to take many more transactions in the decades ahead not force fee market in small blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:35:43
Ye it's a scary sounding amount. It is in twenty years that would be reached in 101. It's supposed to be in line with tech advancement and only a technical max not necessarily the size that miners would create. It does sound too aggressive to me also tho. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:02:19
Would you pay 5$ to send an email? Bitcoin is data and as such has proved you don't need old fashioned expensive systems, it's not stocks or gold. POW is expensive/secure and decentralisation is valuable but miners get their reward without high fees, that's the innovation that's how it has been that's how it can be and that's how it will be. If not Bitcoin then in every other crypto and every other blockchain based transfer.

@_date: 2015-12-27 18:07:01
This is about the only way Bitcoin is likely to fail. Nevermind what way is best to scale, the in fighting and contempt for differing opinions is an example of why decentralisation doesn't work. It's not about code it's about people's inability to accept opinions and find common ground. Sort it out! If we want decentralisation to work we need to pull together and work more efficiently to find a compromise, that goes for all sides of the debate. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:55:09
I think a lot more definitive explanation and examples are required. If this is the answer to long term scaling then it's bloody confusing. How long to channels stay open, when is a payment completed/irreversible? How much will fees be? Where do these channels exist and how do I know if they are not evil or corrupt? Do I have to trust an entity? Will it be as simple as sending a direct blockchain transaction? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:52:31
No! :)
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:23:25
That's what the blocksize was until the 1mb cap a few years ago. It was a temporary solution to prevent miners spam.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:54:08
Until everybody does that and you need bigger increase. We are not at a fee market scenario yet. Not all wallets calculate the fee well and peeps aren't going to study a chart to see optimum fee, it's hardly a slick user friendly system. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:21:37
That's based on an assumption that blocks won't increase which was the plan all be it, not coded in protocol after 1mb cap was put in place. That was an oversight I admit. Fees might rise even if block size is increased and transaction volume isn't high enough to offset block reward. However saying a fee market was the plan from day 1 is not true, especially when fees are insignificant for the next 10+ years.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:47:18
It started 6 years ago with the full knowledge that critical changes can be made with majority. That was why a 1mb fix was implemented, because it could be adjusted.  It was always the plan to increase. This pricing out of all other transaction to fit in 1mb is new
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:23:26
Sounds like a valid concern that needs addressed. You don't want nodes on Bitcoin to become so few that they are only run by corporations and become regulated too. I don't know what the correct trade off is but I'm sure we will find out. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:51:16
Looks like he's overstocks director of communication, so it is the only sensible option of the most secure blockchain.

And the sceptical LN details too, throws a lot of doubt that LN can work. Lots of good points made. No one keeps a wallet/channel open all the time and closing and opening a new channel to find a path to buy coffee is 2 transactions instead of one ect.. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:33:37
Ye I agree decentralisation is probably the most important innovation in history, that's why we need this problem sorted out before it tears apart the very thing we all care about. We have to try and find compromise without censorship or politics.

@_date: 2015-12-16 10:35:44
100% agreed. It should be easier and more interesting. I don't think the memory, bandwidth requirements are as much an inhibitor as difficulty to set it up. I for one would run a node if I was confident I knew how. Make it idiot proof!
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:29:38
Why would anyone prefer that, a system that will never fail doing a transaction is a good experience just like a system that won't double spend with ease seems like a good option for a pleasant user experience. Maybe I'm wrong and people don't mind too much if a transaction with fee gets double spent or it doesn't get confirmed ever. I suppose it's a personal thing
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:58:50
So you agree with increasing the amount of transactions in a block with SW, which is equal to doubling the block size in order to help scale. So you must also have agreed with Jeff G's BIP 102 on doubling to 2mb before SW was considered, ultimatley it's the same result. But you say his point is not valid as we all knew a fee market was inevitable? Well if we use SW to almost double the space for transactions then we put off a fee market, so your explanation of always knowing fees would would rise is Null.  
And yes 51% majority would be ugly but one side with most critical support would win regardless.

Coders and devs make brilliant ideas come to life, like multisig, but no idea how to make them for the mainstream average joe! I'm getting my head round coinkite multisig I think, but wish breadwallet devs did multisig. Too much M of N this and extended BIP that..don't blame people for using circle or coinbase even if it is anti Bitcoin in spirit. Once devs learn to make things idiot proof like apple, then moon boots might come out.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:41:53
What we've had for the last 6 years has been pretty good. Never had a fee market to compare.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:32:26
I think there's every chance a block size solution will be found, it's crazy to make an artificial economic disaster just because it may happen in the future, it may not and lots of effort is going to scaling and it's a good bet that it will. Aim for success not failure
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:11:35
Its subsidised by block reward, that doesn't go away for a hundred years. Fees are an artificial auction, the symptom of scaling solution being slow to reach consensus. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:08:49
It was already changed to 1mb cap, so why you still here. (Hint:it's still the same Bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:17:46
The token of incentive is at least working. Bitcoin has always been a drama queen for one reason or another. It's rarely boring at least.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:42:08
It did have 35mb limit, miner spam was only problem. It was just as censorship resistant and even more decentralised. Raising the block size a little or in steps will mean everybody can use a decentralised network. Litecoin has smaller blocks and is less decentralised.

[1] to [5]
These are all properties of easy and frictionless movement of value. The positive more than trumps the negative.
No currency has intrinsic value anymore. It's Fiat. 
Volatile nature is vital. Without it trading would  be pointless and creates liquidity. Easy now to peg if you want stable currency as opposed profitable volatility.
So does every asset share. Early investors took far bigger risks thus far bigger rewards if they cashed out.
That's its main advantage. Lack of manipulation from centralised corruptable forces. Deflation is good for people  good for planet. Inflation good for corperations wanting max consumption  thus profit
Mining will become more efficient hopefully, if  Bitcoin  replaces most trusted 3rd party businesses then massive savings in other environmental areas would be realised.  Also renewable energy is becoming much more widespread.

Broad consensus of a minority fork, the new POW would need at least 100million of work to match attacker in first few minutes. Doesn't matter if it's CPU/GPU, a new POW starts with low security. They would buy 100million dollars worth of whatever was needed. Besides a minority fork of Bitcoin with no security wouldn't be worth much even if no one attacked it. I doubt it would ever get to that point as nobody wants to loose money on the economically wrong chain. Be that BU or Blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 13:22:17
What's not being said is that to use LN for a payment, you need to monitor the blockchain after to make sure nobody publishes an incorrect state to blockchain. This will need 3rd party's to offer service, but you'd need to monitor them also so they do not suffer ddos. For one or irregular payments it's a nightmare hassle. Fine for small and regular payments, between machines perhaps. Lots of uses but it's not for a single payment. You'd just use a regular Bitcoin transaction for single payment, they may become many times more expensive in future because LN channels take the fees away from miners. If the Bitcoin network doesn't have a lot of transaction,they will be a few really expensive ones, or collapse, that won't work for anything except large amounts. So a single 5$ or 10$ transaction won't work in either, especially not without scailing on chain.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:02:41
Ye that's true they could, don't think it would be that profitable, not compared to mining, but they could do both and get fees on both. They'd have the bitcoins to do it with.

No far from it, there's very secure wallets that you hold private keys, breadwallet ect. Coinkite multisig on PC. There's more than ever now. Trezor or hardware wallets if your bitcoins warrant the cost for cold storage, they are really easy and simple to use. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:09:10
Gradually you see the use case for Bitcoin reducing and fees increasing for no reason except a belief they may rise in the future anyway. Or increase blocksize and carry on as was the original Bitcoin system.
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:06:30
Being involved and paid by a company that's success depends on that of layers, channels and alternatives to high volume use of the blockchain. Their actions show this to be their priority. I don't doubt they want Bitcoin to be a success too.
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:20:52
Yes and it's going to take a lot of work to mitigate and have some kind of simple user friendly experience. Just what Bitcoin needs to gain adoption.
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:41:56
But less people would need to use completely centralised services. What the trade off is by doubling Max poss block size would be very minimal if anything, maybe more people can transact more chance they will run a node. I think it's clear a small increase is good overall.
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:56:50
It's on record that companies have stalled on Bitcoin ventures due to capacity issues. Also if the blocks size was many times smaller and only handled a few transactions, you would have to agree adoption would be negatively impacted even if this allowed more nodes. Same would apply to any payment network. If visa could only handle a few transactions a second, how many people would use it. How profitable would visa be. I don't disagree that decentralisation is the no. 1 priority tho. Just think a small blocksize increase is a good compromise.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:29:22
If there's no vast majority there's no change/fork then. That's how Bitcoin was supposed to work. I don't have a preference if it's SW or HF first or second. It's about Bitcoin by the people for the people, not Bitcoin for the devs by the devs.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:07:18

@_date: 2016-01-20 11:07:39
Core want artificial fee market now, Satishi wanted high volume of transactions to cover block subsidy in 20 years. My opinion is a fee market should only be in place when all possibilities of scaling are exhausted. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:59:48
Well a "smear campaign" as you called it. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:16:50
Raising the blocksize is pointless if it's too late.
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:16:24
Agreed! Let's tell Gavin we have consensus and make bigger blocks then deal with scaling and keeping decentralisation and lots of nodes active. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:11:43
Cores road map mentioned a hard fork to increase blocks size in more than a year, so that's a contradiction. Also what's contentious when the vast majority agree? 
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:42:42
It shows the chaos when it becomes a button on a wallet and not running a double spend script. If 0 conf was a problem then people wouldn't use it, no need for a messenger 
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:25:00
Bitcoin was designed to only change if the super majority agree, miners, merchants and nodes. Satoshi was explicit that even the developers could not become dictators with control. If Bitcoin works then don't worry, no change will take place unless it's democratic.
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:41:58
It's in bitcoins best interest as a democratic, decentralised network that communications, information and choices are censored. Bitcoin relies on its users and ecosystem to not make free and informed decisions. This can be done if those in a position to, delete and censor the services, options and ideas available. Obviously 😉
Edit: this is sarcasm 
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:59:35
It looks a lot like there will be consensus, as in from miners, exchanges and users for 2mb fork, so is this all in vain? At least for a while..
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:18:10
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:45:15
1.75mb if everyone updates max. Besides its more about having devs that believe in satoshis vision and listens to community. Put the blockchain first then additional layers as a useful option, not necessity. Talented devs but that's not enough. Hopefully they will still work on Bitcoin tho
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:36:10
Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be cheap and fast to transact and to scale with raising blocksize. Core don't believe in this and want other layers that their private company are developing to take over, such as LN. Things like RBF that destroys instant conf and allows fees to be bumped in order to fight its way into a congested block is needed in such a design. Such a design is not very popular. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:15:09
Those issues need sorted out without doubt, but they would do that at any block size. It will always gain a slight advantage
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:45:47
At least you know if it's been censored it's worth your attention, we should create a r/deleted-by-theymos. It would have all the good stuff
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:06:06
Operating a Bitcoin node is most likely done by people invested and holding Bitcoin. It's logical to infer that an increased blocksize allows increased adoption and use and thus an increase in the value of the Bitcoin held by node operators. This should more than offset the slight increase in cost of runners a node. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 13:25:39
I've heard statements from you that threaten character assassination, which are politics in its worst form. This cannot be helpful to core developers.
@_date: 2016-01-02 22:14:12
I thought the plan was that shop keepers ect would be a natural fit for tellers, extra revenue for not doing much, plus they have less cash handling expenses, much like cash back is favoured in shops
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:02:42
So Bitcoin is now less user friendly and less likely for a non RBF transaction to be confirmed when busy, more likely for double spends to occur. What's the benefit again? An artificial fee market? Genius
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:09:56
No. I'm put out off by the complexity of it before cost requirements. When an idiot proof plug and play/node box comes out I'd be happy to. I don't think it's too far away

Political smearing is a negative political tactic that launches an unfair or untrue political attack on an opposing candidate in order to undermine their political position and sway the opinions of the voters and gain support. If you find this an interesting concept, based on facts or otherwise then you are part of the problem buddy.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:35:10
What about Satoshi? He invented the thing when no one else could, he didn't put a blocksize cap in place for any other reason than mining spam attacks. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:26:51
What happens to the non accepted transactions tho, just another complication to make the system less user friendly. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:28:14
They are perfectly safe enough for use cases that opt in to them. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:36:20
Who's the so called clowns tho..Bitcoin was run smoothly when Gavin was maintainer then the the now core devs decided to change everything and go a different direction. Now there's push back from community. If you agree with Satoshi vision or core devs, that's the b/s
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:22:47
Ye that's the low hanging fruit use case, gold 2.0. It's got so much more potential than that if only we can harness it, it could be revolutionary. To be able to send money like data in a secure, fast and censorship free way with little friction. That's what we've had, and that's worth trying to keep. That was what Satoshi invented and intended. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 09:25:48

@_date: 2016-01-25 16:40:20
If that was true, then you wouldn't care about another alt coin to the hundreds already. Fact is it's another client that proposes what almost everybody else wants and core refuses, it's not even a big difference, but people will use what is perceived to represent their vision of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be what represents the majority, anything else is an alt coin. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:48:41

Bitcoins only belong to you if you have the private key. You can secure that private key so it's impossible to steal.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:46:06
Yup, I think core need to do more in terms of showing that they are listening to community.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:42:14
Best to judge on actions than hearsay. Blockstream devs have admitted they want a fee market so are doing everything they can to make it a reality. Bitcoin while Satoshi and Gavin were involved had a different vision. While core have a conflict of interest to achieve a low volume high fee blockchain, they clearly do have bitcoins best interest at heart, so do people who want the blockchain to scale now and be adopted and used as originally intended. Why compromise can't be reached is frustrating. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:53:39
No censorship resistance is priority no1. Then censorship resistance that everybody can use that's reliable. That's where core devs have let community down. Trying to make people use less secure more trust needed systems ontop while slowly trying to create fee auction through congestion on everybody's Bitcoin chain
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:50:53
Which gets someone else's stuck, pushed further back. Until it's a bidding war on fees, Bitcoin becomes slow expensive and unreliable.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:47:08
Tell that to the people who rely on 0 conf for business model, they and nobody has asked for a double spend tool. It's useful in a fee market which is not good. The fact it's controversial but merged anyway is sure sign devs are not listening.
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:10:37
That would be First seen safe RBF. That would be a decent feature without double spending like full RBF allows. Anyway clearly the community and users have no say so we just have to work around it.
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:19:13
It's consensus compatible when majority consensus is reached. That's how Bitcoin was designed. To say XT is an alt coin is so disingenuous it's laughably corrupt, and I'm not that crazy about XT.

Truth can be twisted and spun, that's what smearing is. Your thinking of lies I think. They are not based in fact.

I think they are important to Bitcoin and don't need any more bad PR. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 11:34:44
Exchange them on reputable exchanges, circle offers insurance for example. Keep your spending money on wallets that secure your private key, breadwallet is as secure as hardware wallet and is the most simple idiot proof way to spend bitcoins.

If a fork is an attack on Bitcoin and we should not voice disagreement with developers then what's decentralised?
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:32:53
The number of full nodes is reducing because you don't need to run one to have a wallet anymore. They also require technical expertise and not user friendly or slick and interesting. More adoption by allowing more transactions will add to numbers wishing to run node and increase in price of Bitcoin with more users even more so. I admit there is a trade off between the two. Increasing blocksize is a limited but needed short term solution. As for lightning network it still requires funds to be locked and returned in case of bad actor, that's why op hodl was introduced, it's a clever solution but it's no blockchain.

Very much agree, being developers of this new kind of machine of freedom and liberty is going to require more than just coding. Diplomacy and clear laid out vision and defined roadmap or clearly stated goal will really help. The censorship has, for no fault of cores, caused a negative connotation, censorship has no place in Bitcoin. More important than bickering we all need to find common ground and help Bitcoin change lives for generations to come.

If you run an XT node it's compatible with core the only difference is when 75% run it, it begins to activate and at a point only 8mb max blocks would be valid, that would be because of consensus, and consensus would now be that blocksize. Go check it out yourself instead of metaphors of flying. I'm not in favour of XT but it doesn't break consensus but offers an option of new, voted for consensus. How it should be.

Interestingly, a few months before the blocksize debate, a Reddit post suggested their was a plan to try and divide the community and cause a rift. May be coincidental, if you believe in such. Debates and differences will always occur but has it been stoked intentionally to the detriment of Bitcoin..I for one think the blocksize should be increased, but only because I think it's in bitcoins best interest. Mostly I hope for consensus and compromise so happy to go with cores road map and see how it works out. Despite a conflict of interest im sure their incentives are aligned with success of Bitcoin too, as I'm sure 99% of community are. I wouldn't underestimate the incentives and ability of certain groups to divide and destroy Bitcoin also..

It took core til Hong Kong in December to come up with any kind of solution to congestion and preventing a fee market which no user or merchant that serves them wanted. They capitalised on the temporary blocksize limit to push their agenda which did have a conflict of interest. They fought every solution and fostered a divide instead of saying we hear you and will work to address the issues 6-7 months ago.

I thought Bitcoin was designed to evolve and change through the years and decades. Something that can't evolve dies out. Even core plan a hard fork to increase block size. The plan laid out by Satoshi was to increase block size if needed. What if quantum computers come out? Let it die or fork it to compensate where needed?

Thanks, I'm just not sure how or by what process that adjustment would happen, I suppose it's deflation so like inflation in fiat world, goods and services increase. But people don't suddenly decide we should pay a bit more for this because our money is worth less..it's done from top down. How do we reach consensus on a fair deflation adjusted fee? That seems like it requires coordination or manual fees to trigger competition with wallet providers to update/adjust accordingly..

The them and us mentality is the only damaging rhetoric that you echo. It's a good sign that those who engage in such are the shills trying to hurt Bitcoin. Luckily it doesn't matter as Bitcoin was designed that proof is required that work effort and money has been contributed before your opinion matters, that's miners that prove their work and vote with it. Satoshi wasn't daft. It doesn't matter if censorship manipulates opinion or shills and sock puppets shout a lot, prove your aligned to bitcoins best interests and then you have a voice that is highly likely true.

Firstly no one is in charge of this global currency, it's decentralised. Secondly 2mb blocks is not on offer, it's a max possible size. It's also the opposite of premature when congestion and unreliable fee confusion kicks in. Finally SegWit had almost complete consensus, which is almost equivalent to 2mb increase and it's happening.

Bitcoin has evolved at breakneck speed. A year in Bitcoin is like 10 in real time. The issues a few years ago are ancient history. Soon we will look back at blocksize debate with a fond curiosity.

It's potential is staggering, if it realises this is only Unknown.

Eh, he talks about volume of transactions! As in a lot of transactions to off set subsidy in decades! Not a fee market, with a a few expensive ones. Either a lot of transactions or it's toast. It's simple. i don't think you can legitamtly confuse what Satoshi's vision was. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 11:57:00
Yes we agree on something. There's a lot we probably don't, especially your tone and toxic divisive manner. It's hard to believe in high volume and capacity and a fee market which requires the opposite. So we will agree that we have fundamental differences in the interpretation of the English language. Like Satoshi saying we can increase the limit as we get closer to needing to. Then explaining how this can be done by phasing it in. I'm sure you understand this as not increasing it even when maxed out and creating a fee market.

I presume English isnt your first language. I'v never said BU was a good idea. You people as you put just shows that division is your goal and hope to stop Bitcoin. We could quote Satoshi all day long, " the blocksize could be increased in the future" ect. Now you say his high volume was ment in relation to something that didn't exist before.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:46:30
You perfectly sum up what's wrong with the vocal part of Bitcoin community. Ignorant vitriol with a pinch of arrogance. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:16:57
So your saying 3 to 4 transactions a second for a globally inclusive revolutionary p2p value transfer network is high volume? Your chart might look compelling but in relation to any usefully payment network that's laughable when broken down into seconds. 86,000 seconds in a day if you like maths.
 By all means have your opinion, I'm just saying Satoshi stating it's high volume or nothing is as clear as possible insight into how Bitcoin is designed. Remember volume means a measurement of capacity/space. And the word high before it means a lot of capacity/space. You could argue that any divergence from this is an alternative. I won't because Bitcoin is designed to be what rules the majority agree and run.  Your claim he was in favour of tyranny instead of just being aware that such a view might  occur, due to an increase in bandwidth/memory is equally misunderstood. You can limit the blocksize to prevent attack (like was done from 32mb) and increase volume as needed. Was still 10 times more than required at 1mb. If you don't like satoshis vision for Bitcoin then your welcome to the opinion of trying to change it, maybe your right, but you can't change the meaning of the English language to support that said view, is that of the creators. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:54:50
By not making it unnecessarily expensive fees for no reason for a start. Bitcoin has always been a more powerful tool for developing nations, just some people can't see past their own situation sometimes. It's global and that's a big and diverse place. This fee market or idea that BTCs design will not work and fees need to be high to teach people that fees will be high as reward halfs. Price is showing it will compensate as scarcity increases and reward reduces. Like Satoshi  designed.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:46:08
BTC is a p2p cash as described by the guy who invented it! Payment channels is not BTC, not least because they don't exist yet. And again BTC is a lot of things to a lot of people. You are right tho it isn't Fiat at least. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:14:50
But bitcoins transaction volume is laughably low. Around 2 a second. You don't seem to understand what high volume means. It means a lot of transactions. Satoshi also wanted space for free transactions, sure pay a fee for speed and priority. He also amazingly knew that a 'tyrannical' few would try to prevent on chain scaling. If the debate is not about how to achieve on chain volume increase and instead pretending it wasn't the plan then I don't have time for meaningless debate. Not particularly for or against any way of doing this.

Bitcoin does not care what you think and has no opinion on how much Bitcoin people require to send.
@_date: 2017-01-27 22:34:13
I presume English isn't your first language because of your skewed interpretation of their meaning. Volume being a measurement of capacity and why that's the key to bitcoins success. The alternative is the volume never increasing and fee market to drive fees high enough to cover the low capacity and needed income to secure.
Tyrannical is an evil and corrupt, unreasonable use of power and you believe this is what Satoshi was arguing for. 
You also adopt an us and them divisive mentality and presume I'm advocating an alternative development team and design. Makes meaningful dialogue pointless. Lastly it's not cognitive dissonance, that again is not accurate use of its meaning. Confirmation bias is however exactly the trap you have fallen into. My only concern and that of the community is the importance to scale and bring capacity onchain in order for bitcoins best chance of survival and reaching potential. Maybe it's you who should be more open minded in interpreting information. As for your points about satoshis communication, it was a quick fix, why would he not have done that to start with, why would he argue strongly that Bitcoin should always allow some free transactions, perhaps because it was electronic cash he believed in. Why did he want spv clients for normal users and imagine large data centres distributed across the world. I'm sure he would change his mind on some of this today, however he certainly imagined high volume being that relative to a global market, which was the point that moved me to show your contradiction and confirmation bias. Curbing bitcoins ability to scale onchain is the only attack vector as it isn't hard coded, so forgive me if I stand up against what I see as an attack, and while going full on crazy BU is equally risky. Finding an approach to safely increase throughputs on chain is what matters for success. Satoshi knew it, we all used to know it. The only debate should be how much and when.

You seem genuine but underestimate the degree and suppression of censorship. But it's hard to be aware of discussion of different clients when it's been censored. Regardless I can understand if it was just some chancer spamming a new client, that is unacceptable. Unfortunately any talk or dialogue about bigger blocks especially, is deleted unless it supports cores direction change they want with Bitcoin. Regardless of client change or not, it is deleted unless spun in a negative way. Same with alt coins, if it's negative it's allowed if positive it's deleted.

That sounds like a market driven blocksize, that's what BU want, all be it with more transaction at cheaper rate, instead of artificially expensive and few. A balance between the two would be perfect. Limited blocksize by miners with substantial on chain transactions and LN for micro transactions and machine to machine payments. All this with blocks that consumer nodes can handle. Or is that too sensible..
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:17:27
Coinbase is still as safe and simple as it gets, just move them to breadwallet and you will have no problems. Don't use it as a wallet. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:45:42
So Bitcoin didn't work when it was 32mb blocks? The repercussions are a greater problem with the temporary 1mb limit know I'd argue. Are you against SegWit too then since it doubles block size? We are venturing into the unknown right now, never before have we hit the limit and had this congestion and new fee market tax on using Bitcoin. I'm all for caution and safe increase but there's got to be some progress.
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:27:27
If I want to pay someone by LN with my mobile, does it need to be always connected to the network, do we both need to be nodes or always have an open channel to somewhere that may route to person I want? 
Would that require using a trusted service instead of being a node myself? 
Also what stops someone charging crazy high fee, how would a fee structure even work for micro transactions and higher amounts. As in a percentage fee good for micro transactions but terrible for large amounts and set min fee is vice versa? 
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:21:35

@_date: 2016-12-02 22:14:45
Thanks for your explanation, it clarifies things a bit. Although I get the impression that LN won't be suitable or user friendly for consumer making a single one time payment? Is it more designed for services, merchants and exchanges perhaps. Not person to person? I wouldn't want to have to monitor Blockchain or worry about channels being frozen or active for too long or punishment. Is it fair to say that LN would have particular use case for particular type of transaction traffic.

You mean more resource intensive to run a node would be a limiting factor for developing countries. They wouldn't even try while there is no economical sense with costs of transactions. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:53:52
A full node is cheap to run, a single transaction cost more than running a node for a few days. If node operators use Bitcoin they would actually save money on their transactions and the greater value of bitcoins now there's more people can use it. You need Satoshi to come slap ya with his white paper and what he designed. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:00:07
I hope Segwit does get activated, but I understand why it might get blocked. Core have not really shown any willingness to compromise, I don't think any major consensus has or will ever happen without it. It's not about big blocks or small, only the middle ground will keep Bitcoin as one.
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:21:24
I'm more worried about inexperienced small Dev team with no track record. Easy to forget how critical and complicated it is to keep Bitcoin running without critical bugs/mistakes.

@_date: 2016-12-09 21:13:23
That makes no sense. Paying a higher fee can not make something more decentralised. It just makes it more expensive and less useable. Who decides what's an important transaction if fees are calculated? Had to double read your comment to see the sarcasm. My bad

They still use bitcoins bitcoins blockchain for cross border payment, which is where they were seeing best growth anyway.

As the block subsidy reduces its value increases tho. It balances out as has been shown in last 2 halvings, as was originally designed by Satoshi. Also that's in hundreds of years time. There no reason for a fee market except to make other layers used instead.
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:33:18
Your logic can't be sincere! New users and infrequent users are being put off buy high fees and slow transactions, it would make no sense for then to run nodes. People who have a lot of Bitcoin and transact a lot would benefit from bigger blocks as transaction fees would outweigh small increase in cost of running node, that's before you even take into account the increased value of a Bitcoin, and before you take into account technology improvements in both Bitcoin and memory storage/broadband, reducing running cost over time.

It's a problem with RBF. Merchants can accept Bitcoin knowing the chances and financial risk of double spend are acceptable. First seen RBF is a good idea. By all means let LN be the go to instant way to spend bitcoins but not at the cost destroying safe enough low value instant transactions. Let the market decide not peter todd
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:29:34
The answer is so obviously between the 2 views. Don't make the chain so expensive everybody has to use centralised systems to protect its decentralisation and don't make blocks so big only data centres can run nodes. Call it 8mb and adjust 17% a year. Even the Chinese with crap broadband is happy with 8 for now. Then let's worry about sidechains and lightning. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:36:04
if the chain can't handle a lot of transactions with enough in fees then it's failed. Try convincing someone to use Bitcoin..it's the future it costs more than banks charge tho, and takes 60mins+ depending on how many people competing to fill block..eh no thanks, but it's decentralised, although you need to use a centralised service and trust them to send funds. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:21:13
In most cases the government have as much to do with fiat currency as the people do. In the UK its corporate banks that control the supply through fractional reserve banking. The Bank of England is just a bunch of administration bods, employed by anonymous unelected banking family. In the U.S. It the federal reserve, which is not federal, and privately owned by more faceless private bankers. China is the closest to a bank run by government, but the government is not democratic.
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:39:41
Agreed. All the merchants like coffee shops, groceries stores that were persuaded to accept Bitcoin as a way of avoiding expensive credit/debit card legacy systems now find themselves shafted by RBF. Not a good way to help adoption by making double spends so trivial to do. Code should not force the future of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:09:02
But core and XT won't ever reach consensus due to block size increase? It forks so unless XT patches RBF it can't co-exist..
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:11:25

Cool update and widget! 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:29:24
The block size cap solved a problem and has now created a bigger one. If it's not increased and fees rise, the amount of transactions reduce, the value of Bitcoin will reduce, this will spiral to bitcoins collapse. For Bitcoin to stay the same it has to change. Since change is hard and risky and no one controls it directly, the advantage is with status-quo and the block stream devs and chief scientist of viacoin. Who'd of guessed bitcoins biggest threat comes from within..
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:40:07
Least you have a nice looking wallet when your being dragged into an unnecessary bidding war on transactions and a fee market set to make their blockstream company a success. Rotten to the core but nice and shinny on outside. Well played
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:05:17
Bitcoins long term success depends on scaling to lots of transaction to off set block subsidies. This won't happen if it's an expensive transaction network. I'm sure it won't come to this tho..
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:56:24
Lol ok then so because core has more people than classic? What about when core was just Gavin? 
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:38:48
I think your missing the point. If Bitcoin could be controlled by developers then it wouldn't be Bitcoin. Perhaps a different client from core is not constructive right now, but being free from control of any individual group is fundamental to bitcoins decentralisation. That's why it was designed this way. It's absolutely critical. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:41:30
Miners get a share of block reward and are aligned by incentives to make transactions smooth thus value to bitcoin? Sounds like terrible idea like replace by double spend..I mean fee 
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:59:48
How many are there that have commit access and paid by a private company? Consensus is easily reached when your pay check depends on it. Bitcoin is not designed to change through consensus of developers. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:55:26
Yup, totally agree. I've been on the fence between core/classic but I hope this marks agreement with what both camps are looking for. If this does end civil war it's a big win for Bitcoin and the idea of decentralised free economy. It's a win for classic and core, but most importantly Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:18:56
It's mostly core devs that are launching classic, core used to be just Gavin remember. Satoshi left it to him and he gave up sole control. Cores motives have now been questioned, as they go against what Bitcoin was supposed to be, they have massive corporate funding to make Bitcoin a settlement layer instead of p2p network. Creating diversity among clients alleviates any point of weakness or corruption. Whilst I think cores roadmap is decent, not everybody agrees. Gavin could just revoke their commit access if he wanted to control it again. Who's to say core are not the bad guys using Bitcoin for their own corporate financial gains. Maybe classic want to. As long as we have the ability to fork it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:53:31
When it's more expensive to do something you do it less, unless there is no other option. If there's less transactions, they need to be made more expensive, the cycle continues until were either using Off chain centralised systems or PayPal, Apple pay or whatever has least friction. This shouldn't even be a debate
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:10:58
Open and decentralised if you work for blockstream a centralised company! I hope the majority can have what client they prefer, can choose without it being called a coup or alt coin or attack. No developer can hold Bitcoin hostage, not core not classic. That's how it should be, that's how it is. I don't care if it is core or not aslong as its what the vast majority think is best, that's how to keep it free and open. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:30:23
Or a coup by a company like blockstream. If it takes 100% consensus then Bitcoin could be manipulated by just me. The rules allow Bitcoin to change with the majority approval, that prevents control from any entity, that's why it was designed this way. The developers need consensus from those with aligned incentives, core or classic or whatever. Trust in the way it was designed or don't.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:27:55
Eh, when everybody except the blockstream private company want classic, that's the opposite. If blockstream can go against the wishes of the majority then it has failed. It was designed to allow the majority to have control not the minority. That's the social contract Satoshi designed for this reason. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:54:35
In 20 years block reward is negligible...to compete to get transactions in 1mb blocks, fees are really high. People see Western union fees are much lower, people stop using Bitcoin. Fees are then reduced..miners go bust thus Bitcoin fails. Or make blocks much bigger thus much cheaper, everybody uses it for everything and anything, miners make profit thus Bitcoin succeeds and changes the world.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:47:42
Satoshi said the blocksize could be raised later, it was the plan when core weren't involved. If the majority don't consent, it doesn't happen. Consensus does not mean that of a private company of developers, it was designed for miners to vote as they are incentivised to act in best interest, merchants and users too, not the few with commit access
@_date: 2016-02-04 16:24:32
Ok go and change a block or delete it then.

@_date: 2016-02-09 09:26:40
So the reference client is optional but the majority who dares change it is an altcoin and attacker of the rightful ruler. Lol. I support core mostly but I support Bitcoin more.

I'm not selling thanks
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:08:23
In a year or so 2mb will be equal to decentralisation gained from 1mb blocks. Time and tech improvements will allow a stronger and stronger Bitcoin. How we move forward is difficult when nobody makes a final decision, it's new to everyone but everybody is aligned to the success of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:46:43
That means a better distributed BTC. That's a big extra bonus and improvement for ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:48:38
He is being cynical and derogatory towards the concept of having a choice of clients, or being able fork around a group of developers who's control of direction maybe against that of the vast majority of users. Any opposition to authority of core is deemed an altcoin. This is the reason for price drop. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:28:52
Cool I see. So just hope that patch gathers dust in peter todds basement of bad ideas. First seen RBF I'm fine with 👌
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:20:13
This block size issue is simply a major community choice of future direction.
If it was a community choice then block size would be raised by now. The frustration is that it's a few core devs that seem to be acting in their own interest. The direction they seem to be pushing, may not destroy Bitcoin, but it won't much worth having a war about. Literal or otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 12:10:33

@_date: 2016-02-02 00:12:35
It's not fear uncertainty and doubt. Classic is not centrally controlled. That is a blatant lie. If cores roadmap is preferred by those with skin in the game and an incentivised reason to make informed decisions in bitcoins best interest then that's fine. How can you say what classics real motivation is? Core have 21 million reason to keep control. Classic are acting in the wishes of miners and merchants. Who are you to judge what's a false pretence? People can use core if they want, they can use classic if they want. Let the people choose, without calling views FUD. Remember your on a censored media site also, so your views will be informed and guided in a one sided way.
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:48:49
If the reference client and those who have commit access were unmovable then we would have a major problem, so much so that Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today. Who's the good and bad guys if any is what your dilemma is. Throwing alt coin names makes it sound like your part of the problem you fear so much. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 14:13:00
Care for what you wish..the ability for the main reference client to be replaced or at least have competition is paramount to bitcoins decentralised nature. To say any development team can be dictator and never loose its position spells the end of Bitcoin. That's a fundamental design that keeps Bitcoin decentralised. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:06:24
What about constructive take over attempts? Say Gavin gave the reigns over to a group with intentions against cores vision/agenda. Arguably XT would have been too far, so would it not be good to be able to fork away from that if it became reality instead of cores influence? Point is it's not the ability to fork that is wrong but what is bitcoins best path to keep what's truly important. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 09:01:06

You seem quite offensive and troll like, so go argue with the guy who designed Bitcoin. Satoshi was in favour of allowing some free transactions.

Most people I've text some money too have signed up, they may or may not use Bitcoin but it's now at their fingertips and for remittance, thanks to Bitcoin, it's a game changer (for Euro dollars and pounds so far)
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:20:49
I think it's 1% for circle, unless you are exchanging large amounts I'm more than happy for instant and easy one press of a button for 0.75%. That would be made up by not paying a tx fee to get it into your own wallet. Unless your buying many bitcoins at once.
@_date: 2016-09-24 14:59:24
Except that it's proved that what it was designed to enable, does not work as shown with DAO. Whilst it had to undermine the whole point of its blockchain to undo exactly what it was supposed to be able to do. Who's going trust a smart contract to not be full of costly bugs, let alone be immutable. Bitcoin still works and has not been hacked, what you talk of can never be secure. Attack surface will only get bigger as more dodgy contracts are coded and hacked then reversed if in the interest of leading devs. Keeping things separate keeps Bitcoin secure, simple is secure. People like secure.

Agreed, but his point is valid that bigger blocks allowing more users can equal more nodes, even if the ratio of nodes to users reduces a little. Decentralisation and node count is very important but so is on chain transactions scaling. There must be a balance, no point having decentralisation and few being able to use it and no point having mainstream use if it's just another centralised system to cope.

I think Netflix would be better using streamium model with pay per second from a Netflix loaded wallet and/or just pay a monthly/yearly fee in Bitcoin whenever you want.

If fees are same and block size is raised it becomes more expensive by orders of magnitude to spam. A fee market is the right way to go if you don't want mainstream adoption and frictionless payments. Miners would also spam the network to increase profit in a few market.

@_date: 2015-09-02 20:14:12
Don't stress it's just Bitcoin going through stress test. Block size debate is very complex. If they are not raised then in the future Bitcoin can only be used by the the rich or desperate and we will need to use 3rd party centralised systems or alt coins, if it's raised too much then Bitcoin itself could become a more centralised system. Finding that balance and consensus is not fast or easy with Bitcoin, but it will be worth it in the end we hope

Chain is Bitcoin 2.0 company, they use bitcoins blockchain to transfer assets and ownership of anything that can be represented digitally. Nasdaq was one of the first to use chain to settle transfers of shares. They do use Bitcoin or a few Satoshi to do this. While they are more interested in blockchain than Bitcoin, bitcoins blockchain is the only secure and tried and tested one. Bitcoins gain is more in that it adds legitimacy to the technology and also requires transaction fees which will be very important in the future as block subsidy reduces.

BIP 103- 8mb as suits worst bandwidth miners, then 20% increase a year to scale with bandwidth/memory improvements and every other year miners with 80% vote can veto the increase, slowing it if deemed necessary, but not too much control to the miners.

I actually agree to a certain extent..I used to think once people/consumers realised the power and importance of Bitcoin and its blockchain they would jump on board. Wrong, average joe consumer doesn't have time to think or research themselves this game changer of innovation. Like circle try, it will run under the cover and Bitreserve will offer sending and currency on bitcoins payment rails. I believe this is what he means by not using Bitcoin as the currency! Use anything you like as the currency, it will obviously be bitcoins and its blockchain but the currency can be stable bitgold,bitusd,bitwhatever. At least that's my take on their prespective and I think it's plausible.

I get the criticism completely, your very unlikely to make profit on embedded chip miners. The 21 computer is a rough hack piece of kit also, as I understand it's only to get some devs working on software for when Cisco/Qualcomm produce the embedded chips. If every device in the world could pay every other without buying Bitcoin or knowing what it is and anybody could rent their ebooks ect. to anyone else in the world without interaction or effort, then the value of dust Bitcoin and convenience of not KYC/AML 3 day sign up, bank account linking, driver licence selfie buying Bitcoin securing hoop jumping effort it can be for average consumer joe. It's just on your device by doing nothing but plugging it in and paying a little more in electricity.  Everybody and device could also be a digital shop.

Would be great if it wasn't for double spend as feature too. Hope your right tho and merchants and users who struggle to use Bitcoin already don't get defrauded. First Seen RBF sounded like best of both worlds I thought. I know it can't be nice to have hard work you have done criticised, I respect your efforts but worry this could be an overall negative. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:53:30
True but people won't buy Bitcoin, that's hard to imagine as we're all fans and have gone down the rabbit hole, this means people have Bitcoin as per having an electronic device. Also I'd imagine a mining chip IS the device, instead of a wallet/node being associated loosely with the device, which would be pointless without automatically turning electricity into Bitcoin, however small.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:51:55
I'm sure nobody wants miners to steal coins or print coins. Everybody sincerely involved with Bitcoin wants a successful Bitcoin. What makes it successful must include scope for greater adoption, low fees, less congestion and delays and censorship resistance by decentralisation. If that's not possible with Bitcoin then it's been a failed experiment and the next one will take over and do it. Bitcoin was designed to be an electronic p2p cash and payments system, that should be the same goal now. Anybody who disagrees with the white paper or satoshis vision has no place getting involved in the first place and certainly has no validity to claim what it should turn into instead. The main threat to decentralisation right now is forcing off chain transactions because of congestion and high fees. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:45:45
Why bother with RBF if it was so easy to double spend in the first place then..Are you saying successful double spends and people being scammed won't increase in the slightest due to this feature..
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:22:17
Not only can it be easily purchased it can easily be created by devices and just as easily utilised, all without knowing it's been done, Bitcoin as a protocol.
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:39:34
So an RBF transaction can't be sent to a regular non opted in RBF wallet..I don't think that's right. All wallets will have to defend/warn and detect RBF transactions. That's more complication and risk
@_date: 2015-11-21 23:01:00
I don't think there's much they can easily do except taint it with negative media and soil it's perception. AML/KYC is already locked down, knowing who's exchanging fiat for it and why and how much and monitoring it is already done. Bitcoin itself is public, study the blockchain all they want. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:09:19
Are you for real? Let's not scale Bitcoin because at some point it will require stupid fees to work anyway! I've heard some stupid things on here but this is a special kind. Increase capacity and if or when it gets full, which is a great sign, then find the next solution. To say sod it, let it drown in congestion is defeatist and dumb.

@_date: 2015-11-27 23:13:17
But I thought it was so easy to double spend an unconfirmed tx anyway, double spend it with a higher fee then. No need for RBF. Or double spends are not common and 0 conf is used by thousands of merchants and applications with no problems on small purchases at their desire.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:27:38
Ye but the problem is mud sticks, it's too late and debunking will largely be ignored by sensational headlines. Paying for news might help root out trash news sites, but news is supposed to be a window to the world, a democratic tool to inform and shine a light so the demographic can use their voice, that's essential for democracy, paying for news can then be work against that principle. Something needs done tho. Maybe a 21 computer Dev can create a Satoshi paying news site.

No-one suggest accepting 0 conf is safe, just worth the risk for small amounts and therefore is utilised greatly by a great many by choice. That choice has been taken away. What's next RBF double spend 1 2 or 3 conf easily, it's still possible, that's why you wait 6+ for large amounts. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:08:16
Guy thinks he'll buy his first Bitcoin in person, as if by magic he receives it then hands over cash, 5 minutes later it's gone, he's not happy and obviously never touches Bitcoin again. Or all the merchants using 0 conf for groceries, coffee whatever for years now, suddenly finds his sales are all double spent. Takes down Bitcoin accepted sign.

Whilst their concept is difficult to grasp, it's most certainly not about mining Bitcoin for profit or financial gain, like mining has previously been about. Criticism of it for this is like laughing at a fish for not being able to climb a tree. It's about machines paying machines, instead of a paywall for a website your machine pays it a few Satoshi or get your 21 connected computer to be paid for renting out hard rive space. If this is successful and every device has and uses bitcoins, a few Satoshi will be a worthwhile amount for digital goods or to replace advertising revenue model. It means developers can create a new future of possibilities.  It may or may not be success, but one thing it's not is a solution to mine for reward like we previously think of mining as.

If transactions are more expensive than alternatives then there's no purpose to use Bitcoin. Do all the sums you like, more transactions cheaper is the only way to compete. That will increase the value of the dwindling coinbase reward and increase the amount of fees for securing network.

This seems like a backwards step for adoption and simplicity for users. Great tool for scammers. Hope I'm wrong tho

I'd guess that 99.9% non techtards wouldn't have a clue how to double spend unless there was a button. Bumping the fee only is a really positive step forward for adoption. Hopefully more wallets utilise this.

Decent explanation of LN, however still can't agree with you on fees. A fee market won't exist in fluctuation of block space demand. If competition to include a fee becomes too high for the majority of use, assets transfer (t0.con), data (factom), remittance (abra), machine to machine payments (21inc) and all the things yet to be innovated..then it's over, there's no second chance. Business and users won't go oh wait the fees are low now, let's launch company again..then doh, fees are high; it's not viable let's shut up shop. Just like if the block size hits it limit and payments get delayed for days and become unreliable, people's first experience of this will be there last.

The fees in exchanging Bitcoin and fiat are due to legacy payment system, you can't compare that with a Bitcoin transaction! $1 dollar fee for Bitcoin transaction would stop its frictionless movement from wallets to apps to services or most cool things there is to play with, unless your moving hundreds from deep pockets. And to say using coinbase, a big corporation as the only way to move bitcoins is blasphemy! Take that back! That's exactly what Bitcoin was designed to prevent. Bitcoin should be what it has always been, yes there is challenges and compromise, but if you don't believe then don't prevent those working to make it a reality. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:22:55
If you just want to buy then sell Bitcoin as simply as possible circle and coinbase will do that just fine. They and all exchanges that deal with fiat/government currency have strict regulations to make sure you are not laundering money or doing anything illegal. Circle and coinbase are reputable companies. If your purpose is to hold bitcoins for a period of time or stay in Bitcoin and explore all the possibilities of sending Bitcoin around world and wherever you like then a wallet you control is much better and safer. Coinbase and circle are trustworthy for trading and cashing in and out but if you plan on keeping and using just Bitcoin use a wallet you control the private keys.  
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:11:18
25c or 10c transaction fee is crazy high, 3cent for a 1 dollar video works perfectly, even at 50c 2 or 3 cent is not an issue in the slightest. This is why it is offered and used and is cool. There is no problem so why try and fix something that's not broken. Sure sending 5cent for the same fee requires payment channels or something off chain or better. A double spend button like RBF just screws up something that didn't need fixed and forces Bitcoin down a certain road that should of been a decision by choice of free market.
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:26:32

Miners are the way Satoshi designed decisions to be made because they are proved to be incentivised to make right decisions through proof of work. Second layers don't exist and not sure they can work as well as on chain. There's big trade offs on security and decentralisation that's for sure. Scaling on chain should be priority, the blockchain does work and it can work if only compromise can be found on best way. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 19:25:18
LN will increase fees long term as it will starve the blockchain of transactions it will need to secure it or miners go out of business. Sidechains being merged mined is not secure. Bitcoin needs to scale on chain to increase volume of fees. We need all the solutions together. Mostly we need to stop this divisive attitude that is ever present. We need grown ups.
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:03:43
If blocks are full transactions get delayed or dropped. Fees rise and further disrupt legitimate normal fees. This is not a good service. A not good service fails. More fees that are cheaper with no delays is a better service. Let's do it that way surely..
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:12:56
Opening and closing channel is not nearly enough to survive. Fee pressure is just an auction to get a transaction confirmed, which requires transaction not getting through if your not bidding high enough which is an unreliable and crappy user experience and a risk to bitcoins success. Ideally there's a min acceptable fee and lots of them on chain and off chain. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:26:48

@_date: 2016-05-20 17:31:06
I agree that fee should be paid. Satoshi didn't. He designed it with a free space. However to avoid spam, bigger blocks and few cents is a good idea. A fee auction is a bad idea and doesn't solve problem. Sure $0.10 is fine, but not if everybody does that so its not a solution and does not increase space in blocks. Miners don't care about fees they a get a good chuck of Bitcoin, fees should only stop spam, bigger blocks or similar will help this massively too.

@_date: 2015-10-14 22:55:00
The less transaction volume on chain the greater the fee per transaction has to be..the higher the fee the less useful..less useful less transactions until catastrophes happen, as network security crashes. I can't think of a time I've ever needed to send 10s or hundreds of transactions to same person. I can see uses for corporations or certain situations like pay per second Netflix, but it's hardly solving the scaling of Bitcoin protocol in terms of its designed longevity and success, in fact it's potentially fatal to it..
@_date: 2015-10-30 17:54:53

Circle is a one touch buy experience and so simple if you can link your debit card. It's many times simpler than LBC. Just remember to send your coin to a wallet you control the keys to.

I think the fundamental property for trading goods and service was scarcity. It had to be rare before it would work as a medium, thus gold was perfect, it didn't corrode,hard to fake, easy to divide up. Bitcoin has all these properties plus many more that make it an even better solution. Intrinsic value does seem to be a myth. I think if anything it's good Bitcoin makes people think about what money is in first place.
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:19:05
Hey, storing your Bitcoin on circle is easy, it's insured if they loose too which is great. The problem is they own/control it, if you were to send some to a gambling site or localbitcoins exchange or any number of reasons they don't like, they will close your account and not give you access to them. If you buy and store too many and think its suspicious then you get locked out. Having control of your bitcoins and being your own bank is what Bitcoin was really all about. I keep some on circle but not a lot, worth looking into wallets you control key for. Coinkite multisig, Copay breadwallet ect

There was no real debate.

Until that's the norm, then pay 0.50 then a dollar. Then Bitcoin is overtaken/redundant. Paying unnecessary high fees for no economical reason throttles Bitcoin adoption and its survival. This is stupid. A high amount of fees/transactions is the only way to scale Bitcoin long term. It can survive congestion and fee auction only for a short time.
@_date: 2015-10-31 16:56:05

The godfather of PR, Edward Bernays discovered a long time ago that people's desires and wants could easily be informed guided and manipulated.(this he said constituted the secret government).Now we exist mostly as consumers, with this knowledge used at every step in our consumer led lives. That's why it's mostly VCs and entrepreneurs, free thinkers or libertarians and tech savvy people that understand Bitcoins value. The consumer will only reach out to Bitcoin if they are told to or stumble upon it without the perceptions forced on them by mass media. Or use its innovation without really knowing, which is my bet in short-medium term.

It's not hating on anything. This forum is good for getting a broad spectrum of perspectives, rarely are they wrong, just not the most right. I'd love a coinbase in UK, but I understand it's not in the spirit of Bitcoin to be told how, when or what to spend bitcoins on. It's just the situation they have to operate in to a degree. Trezor made a mistake a knee jerk reaction to making their tech closed source, then thanks to reddit, saw it would be a mistake. Gaw simply deserved all the hate as it's clear again thanks to this sub that it was a scam and probably helped save alot of people from it. We need all these perspectives to help create a clearer complete picture for ourselves.

They are most definetly speaking about Bitcoin! Maybe not using it directly, but it's no secret a country's central bank will want the magic of Bitcoin but with control over creation ect. How this can work is the puzzle, it may not. Bitcoin works because it's decentralised and distributed. Besides a currency that does not recognise borders or countries or can be controlled by such is Bitcoins main advantage. It's the important bit, thanks to the Internet the world is smaller and connected thus a global currency like Bitcoin will always be top dog, like the dollar is the world reserve currency right now, Bitcoin will be in the future. Sure youl have digital pounds and francs made in the wake of blockchain tech too.

Breadwallet is the only mobile wallet I'd recommend and like the update. Is a bit confusing not seeing your balance until you use Touch ID or passcode tho. Lots of good feedback but I think breadwallet is right to keep it simple and limit lots of confusing options. I like the unit of bits and agree it's worth pushing, although in my experience I've had moments trying to figure out sending an amount in bits when it was billed in Bitcoin. Should of been easy but took me a minute :) not sure the best solution, options of bits or bitcoins could lead to horrific mistakes! Maybe a convertor calculator in options, but then again keeping it simple and user friendly is most important. Anyway really like it and we need more consumer friendly apps like it.

How many of your users actually only store a couple of hundred dollars in your hot wallet?! I understand the use case and benefits to off chain services..we all use changetip I bet. The good thing is services need to offer something usefull or we would just use the blockchain. If your going to trust a 3rd party then Coinbase seems to be one of the good ones. It's only a matter of time tho before the word hack and coinbase are put together, then when people loose money, the whole ecosystem takes a gut shot. So it is important and safer if bitcoins aren't stored in one big tasty pot that attracts hackers. Vault much safer and I imagine multi-sig saves coinbase of the need for such regulatory oversight and need to snoop. I'm sure you guys would rather not have to be so intrusive with people's funds either. I get why you have to be seen to be strict with AML/KYC. We need a mix of all sorts and types of wallets and services, for all different types of consumers. So as much as a perfect Bitcoin world wouldn't  need bank like services I get it and think coinbase is an important part of the Eco-system at present.

Seems to miss the point Bitcoin is programable money. Already there is decentralised and centralised ways to peg bitcoin to any inflationary currency. So if you don't like the idea of bitcoins being worth more (all things being equal) then use for example Bitreserve and have your choice of any currency or commodity. Least people can have a choice, I for one don't see why my labour and hard work a few years ago should be worth any less today, especially not on the whim of an unelected elite few! Bitcoin protocol gives everybody the choice, even now after only 6 years. The possibilities in the future are only limited by imagination and choices people democratically decide.

A large data mining centre can make up 3-5% of the network hash rate. Sure the pool operator has control of many of these Bitcoin mines but that's delegated to them and can be removed or delegated to any other pool if one was to act against the best interests of the big miners providing hashing power. The hashrate distribution is getting more spread out also as time goes by, aligned incentives is an important mechanism of satoshis POW in keeping decentralisation. It could and will get better but it's still decentralised by incentive.

The cost of the creation of bitcoins and its increase in supply will always equal what they are worth in fiat. That's because of free market dynamics
@_date: 2015-10-25 12:39:05
Private blockchains work a similar way to bitcoins blockchain without the token of value. This means they require trusted participants only and needs centralised points of control. It's has no immutable nature as its dependant on who ever controls the rules and has write access, there is no incentive to play by the rules except for its usefulness as bad actors will be kicked out by the central authority. It's like having an Internet then a company makes an intranet, still useful but not ground breaking like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:19:25
I've never understood the intrinsic value criticism, what is intrinsic value? When you think about it nothing has intrinsic or natural baked in value, gold only has value because people project value onto it as it was useful for trade and looked nice. Money now certainly doesn't..it's paper or digits on a screen. Value is subjective and dependant not intrinsic

My opinions are my own and I've been round long before r/BTC or any of this tribal them and us mentality you are pushing. I could equally say you are brainwashed from North Korea. When views are censored there is no balance which mirrors your one sided views. Regardless I don't care enough about RBF or your divided mentality. I believe in Bitcoin with or without RBF. This divisive mentality you push is more harmful than any double spend button.

GBP isn't so easy with Bitcoin! Really annoying UK banks are so aggressively anti-bitcoin, while goverment are the opposite. Localbitcoins tricky without a good track record, exchanges generally will have extra costs with wiring money abroad. Coinfloor ect take a few days to set up use polish bank. Bittylicous heard are good and possibly more cost effective. I've never really had the urge to exchange to pounds tho :) why not sign up to Bitreserve in minutes and send it to GBP card or USD card? Least you know the value of it will be safe, you can spend it or wait until exchanges finally get decent UK banking service. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:19:14
Bitcoin without its huge POW behind it is just an insecure altcoin, with less features than most insecure altcoins. The weak new network would be a botnet run by criminals with no incentive but to destroy and profit or just destroy for giggles as it would cost nothing. It certainly could never be called Bitcoin. Miners are doing what they are supposed to anyway, no-one was threatening POW change when Ghash had 50% distribution but now over a 1mb blocksize increase it's drama. It's not a big deal. Making it out as a big deal is probably just a way to divide and conquer from sock puppets or hat puppets. Just let nakamoto consensus do it's thing. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:12:12
I agree. Coinbase and circle have their uses tho and is a usefull and needed evil :) wish peeps in UK had easy access to such services. Without doubt tho, users should keep in their own wallet they control, it's just as easy and much safer with the likes of breadwallet ect. Good advice!

Nope! Coinfloor was good then got bank account closed. Safello good for a few weeks then bank account. Dsx regulated somehow with e-money thing, can't figure out and still needs sepa/swift transfer. Only country in the world you can't buy without Foreign transfer costs. Localbitcoins with debit card isn't easy unless you have 5 previous transactions and send selfie with ID.

Ofcourse there's always going to be a top and bottom 1% or 2 or 10, it's how percentages work. Point is that with fiat currency created from debt, those closer to the creation of money from thin air, profit massively more and just snowballs, that makes it an uneven playing field. Bitcoin was cleverly designed to be fair and egalitarian.

I still can't see a future for Bitcoin without a blocksize increase. How will the protocol and ecosystem survive when sending Bitcoin takes a big slice out of it, people won't send it unless it's of critical importance, that means services and utilities die off first. Then miners will have to charge many times more for fees, that will snowball to offset the increasing lack of transactions. Lightning network will further starve the blockchain from fees. Bitcoin was designed to have a high volume of fees to offset reducing block reward, that can't be changed. Sidechains may help with transaction fee increase. I'm not saying raising the blocksize is the long term solution, far from it but I don't see 2mb being a threat to security or decentralisation. By all means if you think improvements to propagation has to come first, but scaling has to happen on chain for bitcoins survival in short and long term.

In the UK a chain store called CEX pulled of a good PR move by stopping accepting the pound for 4 days, only did Bitcoin! This got the headlines and news coverage, even Sky News doing live broadcasts in shop. This is the way to get the message out, using media local or network. CEX also keep all bitcoins and can buy or sell for Bitcoin. An idea like this that uses media will be better than trying to convince individual shoppers.
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:34:09
b. So why don't people oppose Segwit? It's not about centralisation, not with 2-4mb. It's about anything that can be thought of to prevent forking to a different client..(or reducing urgency for blockstream ventures), law suits, contentious and dangerous, memory then bandwidth then the poor Chinese miners firewalls, then it will stop pressure to find other solutions. Without polarising the argument to extremes, it's hard to justify not bumping blocksize along with blockstreams business agenda. I'm not anti core/blockstream either. I'm pro Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:14:58
When people can't have a a legitimate opinion on making Bitcoin sucessful, without insults and hoping for the demolition of someone's integrity and character, its really sad to see and more harmful than either of the scaling solutions. If Bitcoin is going to reach its potential, we need to find a way to disagree respectfully, find common ground and sometimes compromise. Or if you can't do that let the code do the talking.
@_date: 2015-10-07 13:38:26
Maidsafe was being developed long before Bitcoin and does not use a public ledger, true safecoin as a digital currency was legitimised and idea promoted by crypto currency. I'm all for the 21 concept but it won't be ready for a decade or two and will still be a product and run by a centralised company. Maidsafe when released within a year will be easily scalable and completely autonomous network, not just a companies network using Bitcoin protocol. Big difference is 21 can be regulated and an autonomous network can't.
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:31:21
It doesn't exist and nobody knows how to make it work yet and would take more fees away from miner than it gives and requires a healthy working Bitcoin network first. Don't get me wrong I'm open to all scaling solutions and if someone can explain how the Bitcoin protocol will be secured without changing 21 million mining limit and where miners earn enough in fees without a fee being unviable for a user. You can't have layer 2 if layer 1 is not secure first. Maybe a Bitcoin will be worth hundreds of thousands, problem solved :) I'm open to being convinced otherwise..although as I understand it core want the same thing. To raise blocksize and on chain scaling after other improvements first.

I asked a random 100 people and only one said there should be no scailing of any kind. Well I didn't really, but I'd bet you it would be close to that. There's always one tho and probably works for the banks or an alt coin.

So 99% of bitcoiners can maybe agree that 1mb is not best for Bitcoin right now. We should focus on that common ground instead of what we disagree on. Let's start the United Bitcoin movement. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:27:07
No it's the reality that makes it scarce, finite and deflationary thus more valuable. Miners would be worried if it did the opposite and doubled instead of halved as nobody would want any.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:40:27
Agreed although we can't all do transactions on chain so this centralisation force is going to increase, especially as there is no fees  and no delay if recipient is circle user. Circle also have insurance.

Common sense and a desire to see Bitcoin succeed would be the only qualification necessary. I'm sure being bitcoiners they are both technical, clever and full of opinions. Sure if they are developers, miners, exchanges or node operators it would be advantages.

How can you critic the software when you haven't seen it? It just means twice as long before this divisive debate comes about again. I'm all for that! Even if it's a little too much blocksize/weight, which I don't think it is, then in a year or so technology will ease this with advancements. Last year I couldn't get cheap unlimited bandwidth now it's all I can get. So even if you can't, it's coming and is on bitcoins side. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:53:29
Different countries do it slightly differently. In the UK it is the high street, consumer banks that do it. In US the federal reserve is the ones who do it. In both cases it's private company's. Explaining the complicated mechanisms used is not easy in here. Google Mike Maloney, hidden secrets of money. It's a well crafted explanation. Or modern money mechanics is from the banks themselves, for bankers.

The fee per transaction would have to be massive for miner to survive. That's a more accurate way of putting it so you cant pick on semantics instead of the point.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:35:24
So why are small miners in favour also. Maybe miners want more transactions so Bitcoin and their huge investment works when subsidy disappears. Users/hodlers want the same obviously. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:51:18
Or a charity donation you don't need to. But you still need to wait before sending on again and until it's confirmed it maybe rejected in busy high congestion times now. Point is that off chain transactions will become more used because they are reliable, faster and cheaper thus more desirable.

Good that the UASF is perceived to have influence, good for Bitcoin that nodes of users have a say. Good that miners get to be perceived as having influence with their hash power and proof of incentive to make decision. Good that SegWit times 2 (anyone know where multiply sign is on iPhone?) has finally got consensus from majority. Good that we have best of both worlds and the worst of the blocksize debate is over. Bad that core aren't involved but complain about tight Dev time but don't help..yet. This is the first test of what Bitcoin was all about and it looks like it may work in a messy,toxic but in the end beautiful and decentralised way. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:28:34
I'm a user and I want 2x, I want twice as long before this toxic debate if ever comes about again. Don't pretend that UASF is actually the majority of users, it's just a name for the loudest and extreme bitcoiners or trolls. Without real money or skin in the game it's impossible to know which. Thus Proof of Work!
