Thanks for your response, I hope you understand the skepticism - there are unfortunately many scammers preying on the cryptocurrency community. I ended up scaling back my knee-jerk reaction a bit, but an initial pass over just this post and the website screamed scam (only emails for contact info, no info on who is running this, etc).
Clarity regarding who is behind the project and current non-profit status were my concerns; I think the latter has been represented in a misleading manner. Maybe others have different issues, but addressing those is enough for me.

I trade on Bitfinex, but I'd wager that if either face a crisis similar to Mtgox, it'll be Bitfinex and not BTC-e (Ruby on Rails, built on Bitcoinica, has had big bugs in the past, is now fully insuring 20mil USD and 10k+ BTC in lending funds, etc).
Don't put all your eggs in one basket if you're daytrading, it's just asking for trouble. Whether it's 0.1% or 0.5% chance of failure, there is no reason not to minimize how much you can lose in a single catastrophic event by spreading out your funds.

Mtgox (Tibanne KK) owns the EU and Japanese trademarks for 'Bitcoin'. Your best bet is likely finding another registrar that doesn't check for trademarks.

The statutory maximum punishment for operation of an unlicensed MSB (defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1960) is 5 years prison and a $250,000 fine. Note that under 18 U.S.C. § 2, aiding and abetting (helping someone else commit the crime) is punished the same as if you committed the crime yourself.
He is likely to get less than 5 years, since that is the maximum sentence.

I wrote [a comment]( a while back on why it's really not clear that BTC-e is in Bulgaria, since it's a particularly persistent point of contention, but decided I might as well pull it all into one post.
1) BTC-e's creators [are Russian](
Qouting the linked CoinDesk article:


2) Their previous domain registrar [is Russian](
3) They use Cloudflare, a service to prevent DDoSing that masks where a website is hosted, so you cannot tell where their servers are located.
4) [Their TOS]( now refers to Cyprus, not Bulgaria as it did in the past.
5) The only place on their website where Bulgaria is mentioned [is the search engine description.](
6) The only languages the websites support are Russian, Chinese, and English; [their support site is in Russian and English]( and the documention for their beta API is [written only in Russian](
If you have any evidence that BTC-e is 'located' in Bulgaria, hopefully with a tighter definition (owners are in Bulgaria, servers are, their business is registered there, etc) I would love to hear it. But as of right now, I continue to heavily advise against trusting BTC-e with any money due to the continuing regulatory uncertainty.
P.S. since people continue to bring up that Wikipedia says they're Bulgarian: a Wikipedia article is not a solid citation, and that article cites CoinDesk, which cites nothing.
edit: I want to emphasize that while we cannot determine with any certainty whether or not BTC-e is located in Russia, or to what extent it is affected by Russian laws, it is sufficiently unclear that leaving money you care about on BTC-e is simply reckless at this point.
**edit 2 after [this article was published](
They seem to be sticking with "the BTC-e managing company is based in Cyprus.". Looking on the [Cyprus Business Registry]( I cannot find the company. If anyone can, it would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:51:00
* Owners say they are located in Russia but are not Russian citizens
* The company is stated to be incorporated in Cyprus, which is impossible to verify because the Cyprus business office has a 10 year paper backlog
* Servers may be located in Bulgaria

**THIS MAY BE A SCAM**. **DO NOT DONATE WITHOUT FURTHER PROOF OF LEGITIMACY.**
Exhibit A: they are not registered as a charity *or* a corporation in the state of Washington, despite claims to the contrary. Check for yourself:  
They are also not a nationally-registered 501(c)(3) organization, despite claiming to be a 501(c)(3) [other]( [places](
edit2: After re-reading the post by I see that they state near the end that it isn't currently registered as a Washington state non-profit. This leaves their false claims of 501(c)(3) registration.
Exhibit B: On the matter of transparency, their site and posts here make no mention of who is behind Cryptodefense, but my independent research points to Reed Jessen. See below. In addition, their WHOIS information is [masked by WhoisGuard]( This is noteworthy because WHOIS information is required to be correct (at penalty of losing the domain), so it can be one of the best ways to determine who is actually behind a site.
This appears to be [run by]( [Reed Jessen]( a [WA state IP analyst]( Discovering this information leads me to suspect stupidity over malice, but I am still suspicious because of what appear to be bogus claims of non-profit registrations.
Although this may be a legitimate effort, I highly encourage everyone to hold off on contributing until Cryptodefense is able to back up these claims of being a registered non-profit organization. Until then, they could just as well be princes from Nigeria.

Yeah, I didn't mean *incorrect* translation, just one that isn't very clear when translated word for word like it was. I probably should have phrased it differently.

Thanks for the info, but that just leaves us having to take their word for being based in Cyprus. Notably, it is very easy to verify that other exchanges, such as Bitstamp and Bitfinex, are registered businesses in the countries they claim to be based in - for these two, United Kingdom and Hong Kong respectively.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:29:49

People have been talking about this Huobi stuff on IRC. We know they lost SOME money since they are the lending counterparty (unlike Bitfinex p2p lending), did not revert trades, and apparently had to refund a lot of users due to insurance. 
The question is really how much - and I haven't seen Huobi answer that.

As a developer:
1) I think you should more clearly define what you're looking for, since the BTCF's function is so nebulous, and
2) extend the deadline if your goal is to inspire new work. 1 month simply isn't enough time for people to come up with innovative solutions, so what you'll get is software that has already had a lot of work put into it before the contest started.
Is it guaranteed that a winner will be chosen no matter what is submitted, or is there a minimum bar for the bounty to be awarded?
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:30:10
1) It looks like you want something that would allow people to propose, discuss, and fund objectives such as developing features for Bitcoin, without needing to rely on a human-controlled intermediary. 
Would you say this is a good description of the project's goals, or are you looking for more, such as allowing the Bitcoin community to vote on whether a proposed policy/goal is worth pursuing, regardless of whether it could be funded?
2) I think 3months is a time frame that strikes a reasonable balance between timeliness and allowing people to deliver something, but it does depend on exactly what you're looking for.
3) The issue with not having a guaranteed winner is that it gives you an easy way to avoid paying, discouraging many people from participating. On the other hand, with this amount of money on the line it would be understandable if it wasn't tenable for you.

1) Chargebacks are a terrific feature from the POV of consumers because it eliminates the barrier of "is this merchant trustworthy?"
2) Credit cards generally offload risk of theft to the company who issued it.
Credit cards currently are the padded asylum room to Bitcoin's room packed with pointy but useful tools, and people want protection from poking their own eye out.
I'm not saying that this is an unsolvable problem for Bitcoin, just that it's a problem currently.
P.S. to readers: I was originally responding to a comment by about the biggest issue people have with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:20:42
Consumers like credit cards because of chargebacks and CC companies footing the bill if something goes wrong.
If someone gets your password to {online bitcoin exchange} and you have bitcoins there, you're losing money. If you store them on your computer and get hacked, you're paying the bill.
Average people will not want to micromanage airgapped wallets, so that's not a solution.
Isn't this the biggest issue people have?
