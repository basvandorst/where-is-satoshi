Although Bitcoin does not use encryption on the protocol level (only ECDSA hashing/signing for transactions and SHA256 hashing for mining), it does use encryption in most wallet stacks to secure the private key.
If the encryption is to be reversible, no wallet would be safe except hardware wallets that are airgapped.
This "law" could also make projects like Mega, StorJ and Maid tainted. On a final note: If applied to EU - RIP IT infrastructure business in EU. No company is going to host servers in a region where encryption is useless.

Encryption was banned in France, which is about 15% of Europe at the time of unbanning (1999).
By the way, EU, Europe and EU-Union and Eurozone are all different things, while havin the same name.
A country can be part of EU, but not Europe, while also not being the Eurozone. For example Curaçao and Sint Maarten are not Europe, but do have EU regulation (partially) while not having the euro (Eurozone).

But one could just use hashing and signatures for this. There is not really a need for a *blockchain with mining* to prevent corruption. And if you're mining with just a few companies, how do you prevent a 51% attack? Ask pretty please?

Who decides what tx gets into a block? If by PoW: What will limit the amount of hashing power a single entity gets to point at it? If PoS: What if a single entity gets too much at stake? 
What I'm saying is  - A blockchain is really really **slow**. It it what it is because it's a decentralised model. If you start applying non-decentralised features to it, it stops being a blockchain and becomes a persistant-state database with signatures and a form of PGP.

Blockchain (with mining) is a decentralised concensus system. In the real world I can give you something and you would own it. But on the internet this is not so easy - you could just copy the information and we'd both own it.
Bitcoin solves this problem by mining - a lot of energy is put in creating a "thread" of blocks (called the blockchain) that prevent you from creating false ownership.
It's a really boring form of digital gold.
Blockchain Technology is a buzzword used by companies who don't understand what it is. They think they can take the mining part and the decentral part out of it. You can, but you'd just get a plain old SQL/Oracle database.

* Back to ipv4 - use [VPN over DNS](
* DNS is blocked - internet getting really shitty now
* Use ICMP to tunnel your shit out... Govt implements Mandatory proxy servers
* Next step use [Steganography]( inside GIF and JPEG to get the block across. BUt then:
* Govt. uses attack: **The entire internet is shut down** - It is very effective.

The hashing power is SHA256. The bitcoin address is ECDSA and RIPEMD160.
So the mining hardware cannot be used to generate addresses (or private keys). Because you have to a) generate a RN b) convert to privkey c) convert to address d) check utxo.

Not validating. That is done by all nodes (you could run a node from $30 laptop).
But the mining is actually creating the next block that fits the one before. That takes energy (you have to find the Nonce (lock) that fits the one before).
If you fake it, the block will be rejected. If you solve it, you get 12.5 BTC and get to determine who gets in from the mempool (this is the queue of transactions waiting to get in). For including people from the mempool you get to keep the fee - also btc.

BTC was the only real way to get anything *out* of Gox because bank withdrawls took months (or forever). So what happend is a lot of early adopters had to run to the exits and ... well we all know what happend. Orderbooks got cleared out and a lot of early adopters actually got very little BTC Back because they had to convert their USD balance into expensive BTC to get it out.
That last bubble was a mix of hype, small market, and run-to-the-exit at Gox.

Satoshi didn't set the 1MB limit though. But Bcash sucks anyway, for other reasons.

So a mobile LN mobile wallet is almost impossible? Or could you do a 1of2 multisig with a wallet provider that can close the channel for you (in a newer state) if the other party tries to scam you by closing early?
24/7 online is not an option. this creates an attack vector where a scammer can DDOs you after payment so you can't close on-chain, right?

The important questions to ask with any crypto or blockchain-ish coin:
* 1. Where's the source code hosted of the reference client? 
* 2. What's the consensus algo? PoW? PoS? Or is it a Bobchain?
* 3. Is it premined?
I'm afraid all 3 will be very disappointing.
* A:1 Nowhere, it's closed source
* A:2 None, it's a SQL database
* A:3 Yes, 100%

Yes if the Wallet.dat is mising a new one will be created. It will hold 0 balance.
If you do not have the original wallet.dat you are SOL. Do not touch the old drive, and contact  prof. data recovery company. Files can sometimes be undeleted if not overwritten. If it's an SSD: harder.

So recap, Early 2017 he is postive and wants to "move forward" and activate segwit. Late 2017 he's dragging his feet and adds the Bcash altcoin, while the exchange has issues with fees and processing verifications due to not activating the thing he was advocating for.
Something feels very wrong.

The only difference between LN an other coins will be the wealth distribution system - aka - how the coins ended up where to begin with.
Meaning: Many altcoins will follow because people want to be rich, so they make a shitcoin that makes them rich.

THIS, LN is creeping into production and now the panic is real. This is war tactics, they make it seem like they are this close to victory but they are closer to being irrelevant.
Reality is, only 5% if the users was lured into the Bcash altcoin, and fucking... Dogecoin outruns Bcash on almost any metric (speed, block interval, community, low fees more miner centralisatio).

says who? [citation needed]


Correct, it's not defined as a currency by most countries. It's not a currency, it's a digital asset class to be taxed as private money. At least, that's what my Govt. says so I'll roll with that.
PS. You seem like an US person, you don't pay your E-bill in UK Pounds, but that does not make the GBP "not a currency".


The numbers are just arbitrary representations of value. It's in a massive bubble, or maybe not - nobody knows. I think $20k was indeed not sustainable because the cost to mine was way way lower. Hence: Arbitrage by miners.


The PoW (burning electricity) is there to prevent double spending attacks. It's part of te design.

Try the software "GetDataBack". You have to plug the disk into another system, yo cannot recover from an online OS disk.
The free version let's you view if it can recovery anything. It's cheaply priced.
Maybe bring the disk over to a friend's Windows machine and plug it into the USB an have a beer while it's scanning.
I do not have very good results with SSD, they write everywhere randomly so are harder to recover. With HDD I have recovered 1000s of photo's from a formatted and reinstalled disk.

I wouldn't be surprised if malware infected PDF's are posted here that try to steal your bitcoins.
3 resources to read
Mitigation: Always update your PDF viewers, best to sandbox them using Sandboxie, and don't do Internet/browsing related stuff on your main-wallet machine. 
For corporate networks I suggest using Palo Alto Traps - it can detect custom made malware/virusses by behaviour instead of signature. Very good stuff.

With enough resources almost anyone can be "doxxed". Exchanges have your ID for example.
It's kinda like cash, pretty much anonymous except at very large amounts it *can* be tracked somewhat. 
For example you can stay anonymous, but if you send coins for goods/services that merchant knows your chang-address *and* will have some info about you (shipping address for example). 
Unless you never really use Bitcoin you're not as anonymous as you would think.

Pff, good luck. 


Once they hack a major pools, and start mining 51% attack blocks people will notice, and the miners will leave those pools. Good luck hacking 51% of the hashing power btw without getting doxxed.


Could work.


They keep mentioning 51% - but that attack is not at all *that* powerfull, it doesn't break the security of the blockchain, they won't be able to spend other people's funds. Also, when in control of a pool (operator) they're not in control of the hashing power. The users can leave to P2P Pool for example. 5/10 not impressed.


We already had Gox. I hope people learned not to trust 3rd parties because that's not needed with Bitcoin (trustless).


Backdoor with what exact purpose? Backdoors in software will be hard because mostly everything is open-source


This is a Bitcoin killer indeed. Indeed, ECDSA is a single point of failure in Bitcoin. I have opted to some Devs the possibility to include (optional) multisig signing with a different algo (so that you need break 2 different algos). This should be a medium to high priority imho.


This has happend I think. But "critical services to a VC." what's that? An exchange?
Anyway, some good points they have. Let's fix the problems.

Not comparable. Bread is a software wallet on your phone, pretty good for daily spending. Has HD seed ackup so recoverable.

I'd say the Trezor is safer because the RNG/Privkeys never leave the device and it's not networked.

It's not a stock, because a stock "represents" ownership of the company, and pays dividend.

I'm not saying Bitcoin will be the victor, but private blockchains are just kinda retarded.  A few major market-driven chains will rule, about 100 altcoins will have some kind of niche application, the rest is just junk.
A few banks will see the light though.

let the 20MB go for a while. The people against it have been primed with the idea, and there are 3 outcomes. 1) Either sidechains really start to work in time, 2) they change their minds and enough miners/exchanges switch in time, or Bitcoin will get hurt in the process when the blocks get full for days and days and they will understand.

Oh good, so they're making an altcoin. Haven't we all had that phase? Altcoin delusion.
Let me know when the Github repo is public, and when it starts trading. /s
Seriously though, they're kinda missing the point of Bitcoin (the project). Bitt-Cion is (imho) 5 things:
* 1. The project itself (Bitcoin as a proof-of-concept)
* 2. The native currency ("bitcoins") as a form of bootstrappable digital gold.
* 3. Somewhat of a political / social structure (The users of Bitcoin are in great numbers &amp; motivated like an antfarm)
* 4. Open and transparent (open source, open blockchain)
* 5. No centralised (or limited), at least not by a company or Govt.
If people talk about *"The Technology Behind Bitcoin™"* they're mostly referring to part of number 1. Ignoring the rest is totally missing the point, or ignoring it. That's like saying "The Technology Behind Linux" - like what? C++?
Just what we need, more altcoins.
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:07:46
Do tell. Why
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:44:09

The miners would rake in *loads* of profit if there's enough transactions (fee) to fill up 20MB blocks to the brim for days, weeks on end.

The private keys are not used for encryption, they are used for signing. Hashing, signing and encryption are all cryptography, but hashing != encryption.
    Privkey -&gt; Pubkey -&gt; SHA256hash -&gt; RIPEMD160 -&gt; Base58+signature -&gt; Bitcoin address.
When signing, the transaction (using scrypt) is signed using the privkey, exposing the pubkey. THe privkey is neither "encrypting" anything, nor exposed.

No coins are made on a sidechain. They can be merge mined (like Namecoin is). Or use PoS (like nxt) or ring-signatures. A miner would only earn fee not coinbase.
The creation of coins and basic settlement will happen on main-chain for years at least, because I think people will always prefer having their main stash on the vanilla chain.

Download and install the Elements sidechain. It's an alpha release pegged blockchain with very fast blockrate (10 seconds or something) pegged to Bitcoin (testnet).
The idea is that you move bitcoins "off" - transact them (for example a PoS payment system or microtransactions) and move them back for settlment. Not bloating the main blockchain with microtransaction stuff.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:44:15
TLDR; (I'm going to read it tomorrow in the train in full though)
The fact that the Bitcoin system was designed not to require trust, but now depends on it, suggests that it is living on borrowed time. Human nature being what it is, the temptation to abuse that trust will prevail. The history of central banking is full of breaches of such trust, and it would be perverse to assume that the big
18 We should add that Eyal and Gün Sirer themselves do not draw our conclusion that bitcoin is doomed. Yes, it is Armageddon, they say, but they go on to state that there is life after Armageddon and much of their work is devoted to suggesting fixes of one sort or another that they claim would alleviate or solve some of the problems posed by game-playing mining pools. We would claim that our conclusion is the simplest and most natural one, however, and that their fixes, if adopted, would only delay the inevitable and may not be adopted anyway. In fact, there has been a great deal of discussion on the blogosphere about the large mining pool problem. Most proposed solutions boil down to encouraging decentralization, a good example being the “getblocktemplate” mining protocol developed over mid 2012, the essence of which is to move block creation from the pool operator to the individual miner. We cannot even attempt here to provide any analysis of these proposals, other than to repeat our view that these are at best palliatives that may ameliorate but do not root out the underlying problems posed by centralizing tendencies in the Bitcoin system. We would also add that our message that Bitcoin will bite the dust has received a mixed but mostly negative response from the Bitcoin community.
bitcoin players would be immune to the same human failings as central bankers.
Our best guess is that in the short term there will continue to be a drip-by-drip erosion of confidence as the realization grows that the system is compromised. The current bitcoin oligopoly cannot resolve this problem: like the Roman triumvirates, it is unstable and the principal parties involved cannot agree on a lasting solution; they also lack the ability to provide the necessary credible assurances any- way. Humpty is well and truly broken and neither all the King’s horses nor all the King’s men can put him back together again: it can only be a matter of time before the whole unsteady edifice will collapse.

Ok... so how do you move (for example) $10M Euros from one's Greek bank account to an exchange while there will be cap. control from the govt? And how do you buy $10M without major slippage?
There's billions of Euros on bank accounts there wanting to move. Bitcoin can't handle those conversions without huge volatility. The order book is only a few million both ways. The total liquedity is really really small.

As a Bitcoin™ CEO ™ I always read the executive summary (aka the TL;DR-ish) because *darnit* I have meetings to attend to and shilling agents to recruit /s.


















become synonymous with cryptocurrency itself. For these reasons, the Committee thinks a description of Bitcoin is useful to illustrate cryptocurrencies in general.












Bitcoin mining is a kind of lottery, except that your computer has to work in order to have a chance at winning. Of the millions of computers working to verify the public ledger, one will receive bitcoin as a reward. And presto, more bitcoin enters the money supply. Thousands of people are acquiring bitcoin this way, and an incredible amount of computing power has gathered to mine and verify the public ledger.




















The ‘wide-ranging implications’ that Senator Carper refers to are money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. These are the risks inherent in the technology and they mean that, like all industries, a certain amount of regulation is prudent. But to what extent?

I suggest Electrum. only takes a few MB. But because you already send the coins you have to wait it out (or start extracting the private keys, I do NOT suggest doing this.

It would be more expensive to fill up the blocks. 20 times as expensive.
So instead of 20BTC ($4900) to fill up 100 blocks it would cost 20x that: $98,000.
Your logic is wrong. It would be worse if the block sizes were **smaller**. If the block size was 1KB we'd be in trouble for months to years.

    Error: To use bitcoind, or the -server option to bitcoin-qt, you must     set an rpcpassword in the configuration file:

Not.... really. because it still is cryptographically proveable (not just a number in a txt or db). It's a like trunk of microtransactions.
There is a form of counterparty risk though. I think the golden egg would be a de-centralised version where there is 0% central control.
That would be a Lightning network - vapourware at this point.

It's just a random number to limp along a few years for LN/Sidechains/Magic/Unicorns to appear.. Could even do 50 or 100. Although if someone would want to attack Bitcoin at 20 it would blow up in a year to 1TB. Manageable in 2015.
If you go for 100MB blocks it's 5TB per year. Not really manageable.

Listening now.
**Edit0:** Professor Lex Hoogduin is on now, he keeps talking about traditional models, trying to fit in Bitcoin into human controlled monetary supply. He keeps going on about Central banks, and the need to control from a central point.
A bit boring, because it's rather clear that he does not understand Bitcoin's basics. If you want legacy systems don't use Bitcoin. 
**Edit1:** Boring. He keeps on going on and on about intrinsic value ("bitcoin has none, gold has it"). Totally clueless this guy. A guy from the audience wanted to make a good point but he interrupted saying "We are going in circles". "Your argument is untrue". Ok good point whatever you say.
**Edit3:** That was face-palming annoying and stupid.
**Edit4:** ABN AMRO (one of the largest banks) is on now. Hope this is a bit more interesting I was about to doze off.
**Edit5:** ABN is on all about their "own blockchain" they've been experimenting with. "It's a not a product it's an idea".
**Edit6:** So the big word is out: they made a XRP-Less Ripple clone (They litterally forked it). So they used it as a centralised DB. They admitted they own all the nodes. This sucks. "We don't believe in a public blockchain, so we made one where we control the blockchain". They. Don't. Get. It. This is laughable.
**Edit:7** The name "leaked" Marco said it- "ABN Trade" is the working name of their Ripple-without-XRP clone.
**Edit:8** CT asked if they control the software (centralised) if they release their Bitcoin. ABN said yes, with trusted nodes to reach consensus. Not releasing for at least a year. I'm skeptical.
**Edit:9** David Birch is on now. He's very direct: "The future of Money is NOT Bitcoin, and the future of Bitcoin is NOT money. It's not going to be used in sales.". 
**Edit:10** David Birch : "I love Barclay". And there you have it folks.
**Edit:11** David seems to be about vapourware and an "ideas" guy. But he made some good points. 
**Edit:12** Lunch, after that Fidor is on.
**Edit:13** Michael Maier, COO Fidor Bank is on.
**Edit:14** A bit of generic millennial digital age blahblah ... Fidor bank wants to be a "digital bank" with API's while still pleasing regulators.
**Edit:15** They have Smart Banking in their portfolio and "Virtual currencies" is mentioned besides crowdfunding and P2P lending. 
**Edit:16** He's not even saying BItcoin just "The B Word" - he zooms in on German regulation - "25% capt. gains, and it's not money it's accounting unit" - they work with BaFin so they are regulated and can be Bitcoin friendly in germany.  Then some more on some kind of Bitcoin betting API/game they do? Really ackward imho. Some more info on the Bitcoin trading P2P services they provide. Not really groundbreaking stuff.
**Final edit: I have to leave**
This was a depressing watch. If one would derive the state of Bitcoin from this congress it is really boring, stale and broken. The speakers were not at all motivating or innovative. No-one on stage seemed to have a clue what Bitcoin at his core can do, and is about except maybe David (but he thinks Bitcoin is a fixed and static codebase, instead of a growing protocol - because he described features that he said Bitcoin can't do.).
Where is the in-depth non-technical Bitcoin stuff? The wallet providers/hardware builders? Or maybe even our Master Shill Andreas? No. This kinda sucked. Sorry. 
They should rename it to "Blockchain-vapourware Congres" next year.
I had the chance to listen to it some more. Paul Buitink was speaking and I think he's way too hostile and preachy. That kind of talk will just result in you not being taken seriously by financial professionals in the audience. I'm sure he means well but this is not helping.
The 16yo FlorinApp kid is charming and all, but is this enterprise prof. finance material? A totally free and open wallet service? Looks like a regulation nightmare. Although the mockup/app looks really cool and I like the idea and the app UI.

Where's the liquidity? I don't think there's even 1 exchange in Greece. And if there was, it runs on traditional banking and can be shut down once they take notice of the cashflows. And if they SEPA/SWIFT their way out - well - that's going to be controlled by capital flow control very soon.

They'd need to isolate the nodes owned by the person they want to attack. If this would be one in some crappy datacenter then they would isolate it by only letting it talk to their own node. 
But mostly it's more than 1 node and they'd notice that no new blocks would come in. It only takes 1 little hole in the extended star topology for a block to propagate.
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:24:11
That's not a problem because you're not supposed to re-use an address. Core doesn't do it, and neither should any wallet.
Now you could make the argument that the Q computer could be fast enough to see the txn, get the pubkey, derive the privkey and double-spend the output. But then the Q computer would have to be really really fast at the reversing of the key (less than 10 minutes) to outrun the miners.
Mitigation against that:
Use multisig to make the attack harder (multiple keys to "crack"). Or start feeding txns straight into a powerful mining pool so the txn (and hence the pubkey) is unknown until the block is mined.
Once Q computers are even remotely possible to reverse a key (for example in about a week time or something) we could switch from ECDSA to something else (or multiple ) signing algo's that are even more Q-resistent. does changing the ECDSA to something else hardfork the chain? Or soft?
Imho: Attack vector: 3/10 not very likely. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:49:05
is this changeable from GUI? Might be good to let Core auto-tune these kind of settings according to HW it detects.

I'd say don't mention the word Bitcoin too much say "Blockchain" and explain how this ledger works and the scarcity of the asset. Go into multisig, smart contracts and possibly sidechains. Give some examples of future business models for banks (Co-signing, wallet hosting, multisig, escrow, exchange services, mention Bitreserve.org and explain how they operate).

You will only have coins on the side of the fork BitGo is running their wallet/backend.
So if, for example, we fork into 2 chains (Bitcoin and Bitderp) and 
if you hold coins yourself, you're at least able to sell the bad side of the fork for USD. Because you'll have two sides to spend.
If you hold a significant amount: Get a Trezor.

Well at least Schnorr + ECDSA would mean the Q-comp should be able to break both, instead of just one.
Anything that can be implemented that improves robustness with relative ease and without risk of breaking Bitcoin should be considered at least to be tested on testnet should the situation occur that Bitcoin would need a emergency patch.
If we consider the classic Risk=ChanceOfOccurence*Impact - The chance of ECDSA breaking by Q is low, but the impact is significant, so it's a medium risk if you ask me.

I'd do it like this:
* Create a Open WIFI SSID like "Rain" with low power like 25 mwatt (so they have to stand close).
* Make a capture website once you connect (like Mc Donalds does) that allows you to either link a BTC address or download a "special" wallet. Make the user enter an optional voucher "booster" to prevent people spoofing multiple phones.
* Make this website show some kind of Ajax GIF animation and a keepalive (like some refresh or something) to keep the ARP table filled.
When ready to make it rain:
* At the right time do a ARP cache flush (to leave out everyone who left). The ARP cache will fill up with all the smartphones that are still connected.
* Send bits to every linked BTC address of every MAC address
Hacky method. But kinda cool. Works on every phone that has WIFI so no need for special Android/iPhone/Windows/Blackberry apps. or GPS stuff (works crap indoors).

Then a local wallet is okay. But you also reconsider blockchain.info with 2-factor enabled (SMS code phone). But at your own risk.
Looks complicated, but there's a lot of Bitcoin stealing malware out there. Last option you have is generate a paper wallet from a boot CD that you print out. Disadvantage of that is that a paper wallet is for storage only and spending it takes a few manual steps.
Last, last option: get a coinbase.com wallet and let them do the security. But that is frowned upon in the spirit of Bitcoin ("Be your own bank"). But could be considered.

In theory, yes, it could.  If the separation is truly 100% with not a single node leaking in/out Russia.  It only takes 1 node with connections to the Russian and Non-Russian side to leak the entire blockchain back into Russia. This could be done over a landline.  Therefore my mention: only with a 100% block.


If the mining *pool* is cut off, the miners just flock to another (non-Russian) pool.  If a large pool tries a 51% attack they actually hurt the trust/network of bitcoin and they would be no longer trusted.  Not a lot you can do with 51% by the way.


No idea, too much parameters.  Reason for blockage, economic reasons, war, etc....
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:03:39
Blockchain.info does not store your private keys, so they don't own your coins, so it's pretty safe for small amounts. I personally think a webwallet (in your browser) is not as safe as a Trezor or an dedicated Electrum laptop.

Read into security, it's an important part of Bitcoin. Virusses can steal your coins pretty fast if you don't use proper security. A dedicated machine or a device called "trezor" is best, but for small amounts you could got for less.
For semi-tainted PC machines I would advise Greenaddress.it for some 3rd party security. When using a Smartphone I would go for Hive or Mycellium.

* It's still too complex to hold Bitcoin (ok, iPhone wallets etc. are now here, but still requires some knowledge of security if you hold a reasonable amount of digital-cash.
* No consumers version to protect against volatility - For example a USD-pegged wallet (There was a beta called Bridgewalker, it died)
* Negative image due to bad (FUD or not) PR. Bitcoin's linked to drugs, money launder. Whether that is correct or not.

NO absolutely not. Privacy, but not anononymity


No, it does not. It requires mining to remain functional, the protocol does not require it to be competitive.

@_date: 2014-10-18 06:31:16
If, and let's say if the address aspect gets "compromised" (i becomes feasable to bruteforce it) we just patch and fork the code to allow (for example, overly simplyfied) multisig with other cryptographic signing.
Bitcoin mining won't break, it's just a nonce fitting on the block being hashed. Once you come up with some super effective ASIC that generates a block at current diff. in 10 seconds, the network diff will adjust and you are back at square one.

Once you don' t own the private keys (coins are in your wallet) there is counterparty risk. Just like cash, once it is in the hands of someone else.
There have been a lot of amateur services like wallet services that got hacked. Silly mistakes include server admins that left coins in an unprotected wallet, etc....
We are now seeing Multisignature wallets where the service is no longer able to steal your coins without you also signing.
Best, however, is still to hold your coins yourself, and keep out the counterparty risk. Read into Trezor also.
With great power comes great responsibility. Hold your private keys to yourself and secure your wallet with things like Multisig, Trezor or maybe even an offline machine in cold storage if you hold a considerable amount.

He then says:

Yeah, like Bitcoin.
The he goes on about selling scarce goods like his *"psychic powers"* - first of all he seems to lack those because 3 years later Bitcoin more then fine, second of all - that is not a provable piece of scarcity - like Bitcoin does have (math!).
He then goes on that the tickets for this Psychic powers will go to 0 because he does not actually have psychic powers. Well now, ain't that something, because Bitcoin seems to have Magic powers - Like sending money across the globe at lightspeed for almost nothing.

Let's say we are at block 100 and I get to 51%.
I can now mine block 101, 102, 103 and double spend a transaction by creating 101,102,103,104 all over again, right (longest chain wins). But that would halt the bitcoin network to a standstill, because everyone would know.

If you run without your ports open to the internet, you are only leeching blocks from other nodes but no-one can connect **to** you. So you open 8 connections to 8 nodes and that's about it.
Once you have 8333 open you will also accept incoming connections *and thus* help the network.
9 or 10 or 15 or more is not magic. It's just a symptom of a correctly configured node.

uhhh? No. If the attack has 51% he could mine "valid"  blocks with (to the rest of the network) with different parameters, but the other 49% would not agree with him.
Essentially he would fork away from the network, no longer being Bitcoin but Bitcoin-forked. You should research mining more. The full nodes with the non-change code would not accept his blocks even if he has 99% of mining power.
That is a hard-fork.

That's pretty serious. Most of the attack vector hits pretty specific server-type scenarios. Or running crafted bash scripts.
The exception is the DHCP attack vector. I'll explain: What this actually does is the following: There is a protocol called DHCP - it gives the devices in your network an IP address. Normally, this is the router/server in your LAN.
Some guy could be running a 2nd DHCP server in a public LAN that gives out  non-valid addresses or even a non-valid one. Because DHCP is a broadcast, your client will talk to this rogue server when he is the fastest to reply. So you would not even notice, but can still use the internet fine because after DHCP is done, the DHCP server is no longer needed for internet/network to function.
He could include a variable (mostly used to deploy Proxy settings etc). with a rogue string included, that string can be executed  because Bash is broken - hence he could:
* Copy the wallet.dat over
* If DHCP client runs as root (some distro's): Infect the machine with a keylogger/virus/rootkit
* etc.
GNU/Linux users and other OS'ses: Be safe, check your update repo if CVE-2014-6271 has been patched. Be wary of unknown network, especially open networks near Bitcoin events or hacker spaces.
Btw, Trezor, Co-sign wallets like Greenaddress and cold wallet unaffected.

Virtual server. I can copy that server over and over again. Because it does not actually exist as a single "thing" or touchable/countable piece of hardware - hence it's virtual. Bitcoins cannot be copied or made out of nowhere. You could call the network virtual though, because it's not an actual system somewhere.
Bitcoin network is virtual, bitcoins are not. Imho, my 2 cents.

This is a Classic MITM AP-Spoof/Gmail login capture/spoof attack.

* They spoof an AP that is providing internet by using the same name + key. *"Free Interwebs!!111"*
* Crank up the TX power to get a high RSSI and put it close to a table of people browsing. 
* Now they jam the Wifi signal and force the clients to reconnect, or just wait until the WIFI card hops to the stronger AP automaticly. "Because hey, lower dbM is better!".
* Use tools like WebScarab to capture a Gmail login or maybe even blockchain.
Truly evil. But that is how I think they do it.

FYI: Formatting a drive does not really destroy the data. As long as it is not re-written you could have retrieved the data most of the times with tools like GetDataBack.
So you replaced your wallet.dat with a 2011 backup? Uhm... is that wallet still valid - because only 100 or so keys are generated in advance so the backup is only valid for 100 transactions (change addresses). 
**1. You should really do a rescan or try to spend the coins to yourself to see if it is a proper backup!**

Yes, the larger you scale the bigger the profit (and ROI). I would not advise you to mine with $100 to spent. 
You can mine for fun, hobby or just to learn stuff, but it's illogical to obtain Bitcoin by mining when you can get a lot more (and instant) by buying.
Not saying that you should do that either. Do your research before sending money down the line. Bitcoin is a new field of study. Consult your local futurist, lawyer, etc.

An address comes into existence once you sent coins there. You can only move the coins away from that address if you have the private key for that addres (public key).
From Bitcointalk.org:


While the checksum is valid, it's pretty safe to say that nobody owns the private key for 2 reasons:
-The probability of generating a case-sensitive vanity address that long is incredibly low
-All of its inputs are unspent

Mining does not actually *process* transactions, it's just including them into blocks. Every full node (even without mining) processes transactions *from* wallet (senders) into the memory pool. The Miners stuff the memory pool into blocks, and the rest of the network verifies / archives the blocks.

Not all mined coins need to be sold to cover cost. If the mine ánd keep the coins the strengthen the network and thus protect their own asset. In a way.

A lot of Bitcoin holders would die in the process. The food supply chain would stop, and so would freshwater supply to major cities etc. Hospitals run on backup power and diesel is scarce. Hoarding starts, riots start. all major banks are closed to transfers, withdrawls.
Cities erupt in chaos as everyone fights for the little resources that are left. Gas and Diesel run out. Food goes stale in days because there is lack of cooling. People in need of medication start suffering due to lack of supply. Illness breaks out due to the sewers not functioning (pumps). Decease, starvation, desperation... 
Yet....somewhere, in a shed in Europe, is my little Node. It runs on solar - quite happy, waiting for the next block.... that might take a while because the network is down, but once the power is back it will be fine. Modem connections to backbones (once they come back online - they will) is enough to run the network if needed.
What I mean to say is - we have bigger problems at hand if 90% of the power fails. It's kind of a hyperbolic.

I see you edited your reaction with something constructive, so I'd comment.
If you pay $400 at Sears they are prob. not using a P2P PoS system but something like Bitpay. Bitpay does blockchain monitoring, memory pool monitoring, input/output forensics, and double spend detection, etc.
It would work fine for $400 or more. But there is a point where you could corrupt like a mining pool or - heck - buy enough mining power to *do* double spent large amounts.
This guide does not apply when using Bitpay/Coinbase PoS/Bitkassa and $400 or even $1000 with a 0-confirm can still be fine, just need proper tools.

Learn Bitcoin wallet security if you want to store bitcoins on your computer. Consider using a seperate laptop and research how to backup your wallet of choice.
Consider using a Trezor ($100) for more security.

That's either fake or retarded. Using bitcoins for illegal stuff is *the* way to get caught. Cash USD  / WU transfers / stolen CC's are used way, way more for stuff like you posted - should we include a reference to this in the USD wikipedia page?
No, because Wikipedia pages should be about the topic itself without cluttering the page with references unless they are absolutely neccesery in relation to the topic.
Now, I agree that there should be some paragraph on the Bitcoin wikipedia entry on "dark net" usage, but mentioning CP **specifically** (Why no animal porn? Or other illicit video material?) in the **introduction paragraph** is such a downer and completely unnecessary.

The backing remains the same. The security is secured by the hasing power. Mining  or 51% attack does not break the signing security of the blockchain (ECSDA).

So... what can I make with this? Would some real life example not be helpfull? Like a Hello World example that actually gives semi-skilled programmers the "Aha!"  moment.
Also, the amount of negativity on the ethereum subreddit about this fork makes me.... cautious in trusting that community. I spent a lot of BTC on Ether but I'm starting to regret this. 
I though it was the top-tier of open-source believers that would applaud to any fork/improvement of the codebase, instead Counterparty is frowned upon and there are even devs suggesting closed source.

@_date: 2014-06-21 13:30:51
My theory is that by bitcoin usage (donations, spending) there is  excess of BTC and the market is being drained by Bitpay transactions that send the USD to merchants.
So adoption = price going down - Up to the moment the critical mass is reached and people no longer "cash out" but just close the loop.
Also there are still 3600 coins mined every day, all year long.

*[Citation needed]*
Quantum computing does not break the laws of physics, 196 bits is still a lot to bruteforce. A spent address that has once been used to sign an transaction could be determined, that is why one should not re-use addresses.
Anyway, mining does not break when quantum comes along. ECDSA - well who knows - but "we" can change the signature algo by hardfork, this does not change the financial rules (mining, limit, etc) of Bitcoin protocol.

Apple won't allow a full-app Bitcoin wallet. Mike is working on a webwallet that works also on iPhone. The very last problem is the QR scanning. This is by far the hardest thing to pull off in Safari without some 3rd party app.

Fair enough. I don't hold a high stake of bitcoins so it's not a gamble. I've did some work as a dev and got paid btc. I would agree that daytrading bitcoins would be gambling, but just holding btc? What's at stake? 




Worthless? It's still $300+ while it was $100 a year ago. I think calling it a currency would not cover what it is - it would imply some sort of govt. emitting it.




You don't. The blockchain does not contain meta information. If you would prefer even more privacy you could use Darkwallet. 




Yeah, that's the title of the whitepaper. *"A peer to peer digital cash system"*


In my opinion, that's a stupid name. It does not even use encryption, Bitcoin only uses hashing for the protocol itself.




How would one hand over cash over the internet? Using a payment processor... like Paypal. When buying from the US: Bitpay takes my bitcoins and pays the merchant USD. Paypal takes my Euro or GBP and give the merchant USD. I see no difference.




Agree. I meant profit as in "richer" - English is not my native lang. 




It's about technical trust. On a computer system one cannot make sure the other party double spends or is who he says he is (etc). Blockchain tech as it is is a proof-of-concept tech. solution for this problem.




Money is anything used to exchange value for transactions. Currency is a specific type of money. You *could* call bitcoin currency, but that would confuse people because (up to this point) currency is emitted by govt. and central banks. Hence, my prefer-ration of digital cash or digital assets. It's just a number in ledger, not actual currency. 




For fun, experimentation, speculation, hobby. That is why I play around with the idea. It's just a hobby.




Banks/Paypal are not money, network and payment system themselves. Paypal is to USD as Bitpay is to bitcoins (not Bitcoin! Stupid name ;))




Then, maybe, Bitcoin is not for you. It's not advised to run a full node - as to quote you "upload more data" as a normal user, by the way. Better off using a SPV client.


It remains to be seen if zero-reward blocks will get mined. It's a free market, and if miners don't include transactions they get *nothing* so there's that....




USA/Western privilege... Again, maybe Bitcoin is not for you.






See above.








See above.








You seem to not understand the difference between Bitcoin protocol and people using the currency (like gox). If a bank goes bust - Lanski for example, does that destroy a fiat system like Euros? No.




Any numbers or facts on that? Because this is very biased.






I don't cary bitcoins on me, and neither in a hotwallet.


unusual transactions.*
If you PC gets hacked, and you are to blame, they won't pay (at least that is the case in EU).


Trezor wallet, 2FA, cold wallets, etc. will secure you against this.




Yep. But it's not all that bad, they don't seem to be 100% hostile in the US. I don't live in USA so don't really care that much.




members are a cancer, then you are fucked. *
Why? What would that do?


Miners leave a pool if it goes rogue because it would hurt bitcoin - and hence - their own asset and investment. 




Fair enough.




Stay classy, my grandpa died in the gas chambers. Weak argument by the way. Germany has abut GDP of 25% of the USA. For such a small country that's pretty impressive imho.




It's not legal tender, that would be silly. It's just defined as private money.

The weakest chain the link is the network connection. 3 nodes on 1 IP do not really help. I would think at least

* About 100GB per month traffic

I run a lot of Bitcoin nodes. I do this for fun, and because Bitcoin is a hobby. When its considered illegal to do so (providing services to NY residents) I will stop doing this. It's not worth getting herassed/arrested at JFK Airport for when going on holiday.
And companies who run nodes are, with these regulations and without a Bitlicense in violation of the NY law. Sure, won't be a problem if you are in some obscure country, but I don't think a company lawyer or legal adviser would advise you to ignore a specific law like this. Better safe than sorry.

Fees are anything from 0% to whatever you want. 0-fees are even fine, but it can take a long while before a miner picks up the transaction. If your transaction does not have large amounts of (dust) inputs I would say a few hours.
The recent Silkroad FBI coin was moved with zero fee.
The default bitcoin-qt client has 0.01mBTC as a default fee. Electrum is 0.1mBTC as far as I know.

Technically, yes. If you include a huge fee in the 2nd transaction, mining the first *and* the second in the next block would be profitable. But I'm not sure that miners are monitoring this. Would be wise to do so.
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:29:48
Is it possible to do a "forward" checkpoint styled rollout of such a fork?
That way we can say *"Ok, we will start accepting blocks larger then X at block Y - 30 days in the future, or 5000 blocks ahead."* That way all the miners have time to upgrade the mining backend. and we won't have the network fighting between the 2 different forks.
This seems smart:
* Make the code as such that 30 days from now the larger blocks are allowed (forking the blockchain from people who refuse to upgrade).
* Roll out the new client/code to all miner/mining pools.
* Monitor the network if adoption of the new client works
That way there won't be a critical period.

You seem to be right, in the case of USA. But,  for example, in the EU the max. amount of coins to be accepted as legal tender is officially 50 [1]. This does not make the euro *not* legal tender. The method of payment is the fact that makes the *transaction* legal tender-ish. Bitcoins are not legal tender as paying with 500,000 1cent coins for a debt.
So if you owe 100k euros to the Tax administration in Germany, you can't drive by with a truckload full of 1-Euro coins.
Same in Canada, etc.
If you and I had a business debt - and you offered me bitcoins as a settlement, that would be *just fine*. If, however I had to pay you, you have to *right* to refuse bitcoins, and I have the *right* to make you accept a wire transfer (*legal tender*) instead.

* Write down the seed your get - this is the offline backup feature. Protect it very well!
* Put a password on the wallet. Write it down also
* transfer the Bitcoin to the wallet.
* Never, every use the laptop for anything else. It's a dedicated Bitcoin wallet.
* Be done with it and have a beer. F5 redditand the charts and become obsessed with Bitcoin ;)
What about fire/loss? You still have the Electrum seed. It looks like this


You can do 1 or multiple things with it.;
* Split it in two and keep it in 2 different places
* Etch it into a piece of Stainless Grade 316. Won't burn down.

Face-biometrics is a fancy word for "picture taken" and mapping your face. EU Passports require the same, you need to give a picture of your neutral face, ears visible, so they can map your face. Fingerprint are also required and stored on the card. I tried to decline, but could not get a passport if I did.

Most proper wallets (Bitcoin-qt, Multibit, Electrum, Trezor, Greenaddress, etc) use change-addresses. Even Mycellium has it. It's not excuse to re-use addresses and say Bitcoin has no privacy.
I'm not mentioning offchain/sidechains because they don't excist. And Tumblers only make things worse.


It's not. Just use a wallet that uses the protocol like defined in the whitepaper (change addresses) and you are fine.
It's like serial numbers on cash - they can be tracked *if you really want* but it's not really easy or even do-able.

If you look at the volumes of trades during the ATH above $1000 there was hardly any volume, and it was only like 8 days. Not a lot of people bought above $1050 (Stamp price). Gox price were already unrealistic.
Let's see in 6 months where we are. I think Bitcoin is still stable around the $330 range in 6 months. Limiting your view to 1 Anual year is very silly, imho.

Afaik; Blockchain.info is supposed to fall under these new regulations.
Weird, because they don't handle private keys (not stored on their servers) and therefore they are just a fancy Bitcoin-node (accepint transactions over a web interface).

There are 2 types of "Online" wallets.
* Wallets that hold your private key for you (Xapo, Circle) - if they die, coins gone.
* Wallets that don't hold your private key for you. Like blockchain.info, myTrezor, Green address.
Both have pros and cons. Just ask yourself the question; can you secure your computer good enough to keep the private keys safe? Or do you trust a third party? If a virus gets to your private keys your coins can be stolen.
It's a personal choice.

That is if everyone just leave, suddenly. Like no single miner left in the world. That's pretty .... unrealistic.

I don't think PoW is wasting. What I meant was that a blockchain without "bitcoins" (or peercoins for example) won't work - there is no financial motive to keep supporting the network and it will break.
I could very well be that some altcoin will (one day) take on a large portion of the cryptocurrency space that Bitcoin is now leading, but a rewardless blockchain without mining in any way.... won't work imho.

Blockchain grows, but so does storage. A 1 TB blockchain or more is not unthinkable, 
Also, the blockchain can be "pruned"  (cleaned) and can be split into multiple "blocks". 
Then there is also Sidechains - no need to spam the important blockchain with small transactions, just put them in a sidechain and once in a while make a few big-chunk transactions in *Bitcoinfast-chain* network, back to your main Bitcoin balance.

Hi there!
2 ways of doing so.
First one is sign up with Bitpay.com and let them do the hard part....
Second one is accepting Bitcoin, and just keeping it (For later trade to USD if needed)
I'm going to assume you are not an IT-Professional. does not matter, but it is kind of a challenge to keep Bitcoin safe on a regular PC. I would recommend buying a cheap-as-chips Android tablet and installing nothing but Mycellium wallet. It can act as a receive "wallet" and it gives you live pricing for conversion ("That room wil be 0.053 Bitcoins sir").
Mycellium also gives you a nice "backup" that you have to keep safe (in a your vault).
Good luck. Questions. Ask away.

* Volatility: Optional USD denominated wallets (like Bridgewalker before it was bought by Hive). Just short the amount of BTC kept for consumers and presto no more volatility.
* Volatility will go down in the future, like it did up until now. No more 25% in a day but reaching FOREX levels like USD/Euro - those are also not really a problem.
* Security: Semi hosted (multisig) wallets like Circle or Xapo (they hold 1 key, you hold 1 key (or more) and a transaction is checked for security (automatic, or by phone) before going through.

You don't understand how blockchain works. As long as I keep running the Vanilla Bitcoin version, it won't accept blocks that are mined outside of spec. Honest miners will keep mining the original (21M, Vanilla, coinbaseless) Bitcoin, and everything will be fine. Sibble attacks won't work either, my, and anyone's vanilla bitcoind daemon just does not accept your fake 22M-Bitcoin blocks. They can mine fake blocks all they want, they won't fit. Rejected. After a while my client, and other full nodes will even auto-mark them as "Misbehaving". (since v0.5 or something)
If you don't understand this.  I don't have the time to keep educating you.  Please read the whitepaper for a detailed description.

To be fair, I think it can, it's just a matter if you want to spam the blockchain. But it should not. With trusted parties (like now) your could bundle (for example) up to 1000 transacstions between banking peers into a single BTC transactions. No need to spam the blockchain every second.
Bitcoin's major issues are volatility, and non-reverse-ability (a fuckup is made every day, but Bitcoin is non-forgiving).

Before Bitcoin, digital items were unable to create "scarce" without central control because you could just copy them. With Bitcoin, you can't double-spend a digital item.
Think of it like trading an apple. I can give you an apple, and that would be it. You hold the apple, I don't. You eat it, I can't.
With, for example, a digital drawing of an Apple, I could give you the apple, but I could (if I wanted) still hold a copy. 
This is what Bitcoin does: decentralized concensus.

@_date: 2014-04-28 10:10:06
Miners solve blocks. They generate them and those are propagated to the network. If there are not enough nodes, transactions can not propagate fast through the memorypool between pools and this makes a double spending attack less hard. 
If you would only have 5 nodes you could loose the connection to the remaining 4 if your internet is crappy or part of the split.
You end up with a "split brain problem" - Bitcoin can fix that, the longest chain that miners make will win, but if you end up on an orphaned block your transaction gets reversed.
Full nodes provide stability, not security per-sé.

As long as you only have 1 chance to guess (and with good OS/IP/Heuristic detection) a PIN is actually valid as a basic proof-of-identity. It should however not be proof enough to move funds.
Once you are allowed to bruteforce (wallet file, local db, etc) a 4 digit pin it is no longer secure. And keep in mind that a compromised machined (keylogger) does not matter in password length ("7533" is just as secure as "kljhlko0uoYOUSHALLNOTPASSidu2349393" once keyloggers or MITM comes into play).

I made this earlier, for my nephew who wanted to know. 
*Bitcoin: Explained avoiding technical terms.*
So Bitcoin is a network of computers. Running software that has certain rules. Rules like "This much" etc.
All Bitcoin computers have a big file of transactions. It's like a big book with millions of rows. Every 10 minutes there is a new row added to the big book. It has to start with a certain number, and this takes a lot of thinking by the computers to make.
This big book is the blockchain. The computers are mining.
So each 10 minutes there is a new block. It contains all transactions - like John paying Jill for a Pizza - of that 10 minutes.
All the miners are like really boring office workers, checking if the first to solve the puzzle is actually legit.
If anyone tries to raise his finger and call out a false puzzle, they are ignored. This process secures the blockchain from double spending coins you do not have or you already used.
Once a miner solves a block they get 25 bitcoins - out of thin air * for being such a nice lad and helping the network yet another 10 minutes.
If too much computers join the numbers get bigger and bigger - this is to limit the amount of coins according to the rules of the protocol.
Why is it worth something? Because it's an open, honest system of tokens that cannot be faked. Once you hold bitcoins, you know how the rules are.
One of the rules is:
*There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins*
---------------- 


Buy at Coinbase or any other exchange. Or by getting paid or tipped with it

Hi. :)
Some guy made the original protocol, and slowly the value of the network increased (more miners, more power, more acceptance). There are over 500 bitcoin clones, like your "Gigacoin" - they are mostly worthless because it does not actually add anything to the bitcoin protocol.

No. If 51% of the nodes "rejects" a block because of some hack in the code, your full QT wallet can still wait for 6 confirms, it won't give a shit about the "reject" because 51% of the mining power will think otherwise.
0-confirms can get tainted though.

A bit of nitpicking, but, it's actually like this:


@_date: 2014-04-28 09:24:31
open up your Router, and look for Port Forwarding or NAT. You have to open your external port 8333 to be forwarded to the internal (192.168.x for example) node. So you tell your router: "Hey, I want port 8333 traffic to be forwarded to 192.168.0.10 on the same port, please".
Now your node is reachable by the  network from the outside.
If you are running a public IP address, there is no need. (like in a data center)
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:14:07
This. And Bitcoin provides privacy, not anonymity.

Yes. There are 2 types of wallets. 
* Full wallets (Full copy of the blockchain and your keys).
* Thin wallets (No copy of the blockchain, only keys).
The first one is mostly run by the more tech-savvy or developers. The second one is good enough (imho) for normal day to day use. For example Electrum wallet or all Android/iPhone wallets are thin (They don't have a copy of the blockchain).
Loose the wallet (keys) - you loose the Bitcoin. So backup that wallet file! (each valid into the future, so a backup every few months is ok).
Alternatively, there is something called HD wallets - those wallets have a nifty backup feature in the form of a "sentence" you have to write down. If your computer is stolen of broken, you can always do a  disaster recovery with the HD "seed".
Electrum wallet is one of them.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:05:01
I don't think that is how it's going to work. Once the bitcoins are on the side-chain they are still bitcoin and, sorta, have the same value.
If a sidechain adds "value" - that project can be cloned (open source) and repeated. I don't think sidechained coins are worth more then normale ones.

Not much, Bitcoin is not (yet) for people who can't handle computer security. I would not dare use a Windows system, let alone for Bitcoin.
What is needed for illiterate users is:
* Trezor alike dongles (with 2FA)
* Multisig wallets with external parties co-signing the transaction (but *not* owning the keys). 


CPU and GPU mining is dead. No way that is profitable, also it kinda overheats the PC - noticeably.


I trust myself. If you don't Bitcoin is not for you.


They prob. are not aware of security enough to even handle Bitcoin, to be honest.


Yes, and they shouldn't want that. There will be bitcoin banks, there already are:  - they host your wallet and even have guarantee.

It would not be decentralized;
* They would loose control as soon as they release the code into the wild - for instance - what if Amazon made Bitcoin. They have no control and cannot shut it down - legal issues
* Premined; look at Ripple.
* You cannot make something decentralized that is directly backed (not saying valued) by something centralized (USD)

No, sorry!. You really have to be careful. 


AFAIK, when importing a key (on blockchain.info) the balance is swiped to the blockchain address. But you should never ever throw away a paper wallet just in case you make a mistake (like sending an transcation to an old address or a copy-pate mistake). When importing on a Multibit or Core wallet the privkey is saved in the "keychain" and nothing is swiped. Needs a backup after that!
Re-check all your wallets, check the privkeys, etc... 
**A quick 1 minute analysis**
This address consists of 4 sources. As you can see. Those transactions are done here
It looks like some "larger" wallet with 15+BTC send those 10.09 to 12VrVY but also some other addresses. My guess is it was some sort of exchange or hosted wallet.
Check your Coinbase (and other exchange) if the 12VrVY address is listed there as a payout address.
The date of the 10.09 send to 12vrVY is *2014-06-13 13:03:03*

Nope, the radio part would be partially centralized, but it's a non-fakeable way to transmit a payment (one way).
Decentralized does not mean some parts of the network are maintained by 1 entity, it means that they have no control over the bitcoin protocol itself.
Your ISP is centralized - But it can't forge/change/merge/mutate/fork the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:24:42
It's both. 
It's a marketing ploy, and maybe a small toe-dip to get some experience with bitcoin. Because it's mostly digital items for sale (games) it's a very small counterparty risk for them (Because: games=Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, done another product shipped). 
Getting some Bitcoin experience is smart imho; Never know what will happen.

Yep. Someone has to: 
* host the incoming line
* do the conversion from DTFM to Blockchain network (automated)
An incentive for this is that the host could monetize the line-hosting by asking $0.20 a minute, via the existing phone number costs system (so a transaction over DTFM would cost $0.10 for example).

**EU style notation:**

I don't think that is the case. Not 100%, more like 70% and the rest is semi-clueless. Either way, you should not enforce a personal opinion as a default compile option. 
It's a slippery slope, what if some other dev/packager would say "I don't like eligius || whatever and I'm going to drop/blacklist txid's by it by default" (not that that's going to work, but ok).
You are letting something else besides the blockchain/mining/market decide what is wrong and what is not, that is not how Bitcoin should work. Obvious non-standard transactions banning? Yes. Banning-by-entity or use? No.

Well you need a proper P2P infrastructure and Bitcoin is "the big mover". There needs to be some proper distribution of wealth, and although Bitcoin is not the best distributed token, it's done pretty well the last few years.
It's a protocol. You can write BIP improvements on or besides it (upcoming sidechains/tree chains) 
But what kind of altcoin do you think will overtake Bitcoin (For what it is, a de-central controlled P2P Digital Cash system)?

XBT = BTC. So a XBT is just the Forex way of saying "1 Bitcoin"
* 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC
* 1 mBTC = 1000 uBTC also known as "bits"
* 1 uBTC = 100 Satoshi

Yes. But the time-delta is 10 minutes, with a 1 Megabyte blocksize limit. This comes down to (but not limited by) around 7 TPS.
So. Yes, if you are the 8th transaction in that second, you could end up in the next block. If you include proper fees this should be no problem.

ASIC machines are over 1000x more efficient then a videocard. They are specially made.
Google "Antminer" to find something to start with. One of those machines mines around 100 or more videocards of power. Before you make any decision (I would argue; don't mine though) check out It's a very competitive market. You would be competing with crazy guys like this:

Ok, so the world ends and a *huge* meteorite crashes into the earth, taking out a whole continent. A lot of coins would become umoveable because the backups would be lost and all the people gone.
So we now have 10 million Bitcoin, because half is missing. Is that really a problem? Won't having halve the world's population gone be worse.
Bitcoin are infinitly devideable, even crazy things like 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

Once the "attacker" has 51% of the mining power, he will be able to re-mine blocks ("go back in time") with a high chance of success.
* Everyone would notice
* He would have to stay at 51% for hours, days en weeks, forever, to stay successfull
* He can't really do damage, put while he is 51% he (in a way) makes the blockchain unuseable for the time being. Teh Alert key will be raised by those having the key (Gavin, Satoshi...?).
* He can't rewind transactions from *before* he got 51%
* He can't spent other people's coins.
* He needs to **own** the miners he is 51% attacking with - Ghash.IO for example does not own the miners, and like any pool, will quickly lose 51% because miners will leave the pool if they go rogue.
I'm not attacking you - just wondering what kind of scenario you foresee happening.

Well, Moore's law says double the capacity every 2 years.... so in 5 years a 10TB SSD PCI-Card (that's where we are going) will cost you about $150.
A Bitcoin block is not 1MB yet. They are still about 250kb on avarage. The entire blockchain is about 40GB now - that's a 10$ USB stick it can run off.
Even if the blockchain would grow at 5MB per block it would still only grow 720MB per day or about 262GB per year. That's 5MB per block so 20 times the current volume...
Solutions when storage can't keep up (IF). One could think off:
* Chain segmentation / deduplication on block level (using, for instance, GlusterFS or ISCSI block storage).
* Chain defragmentation (Loop-ed back transactions with a 0-balance can be left out).
* Oracle styled supernodes that are maintained by the larger Bitcoin investors (hence protecting the network) that have a full blockchain - smaller mini-nodes that only have that last xxx blocks (So a semi-SPV client).
* Cheap read-only storage like Sony's Archive Disk (
In my job I already handle RAID arrays that are over 72TB (yes, Terabyte). Those arrays are expensive, but Moore's law keeps up with the growth of video/image/SQL/Oracle data for 10s of years now. even more, the demand for storage does not keep up with the growth of the storage - and thus the price per Gb goes down and down.

*Edit, fun story:* Offtopic, in the netherlands you pay BPM (Polution Tax) over the price of a car, after that you pay BTW (VAT) 21%. Then the road Tax is calculated on that number. After that, I pay Tax on my gas. So I pay Tax per month, over tax, over tax, using tax (fuel).
It's taxception in the EU.

Stuff holding adoption back
* No cheap, good, insta-grab available USB hardware wallet (although Trezor is cool, it's too expensive and hard to get). We need an USB smartcard wallet. $10 max. working on PC/MAC. BIP032 HD Seed backup. Most importantly: Available at Wallmart. 
* Terms like "Mining" "blockchain" "millibits" "wallet" etc.need to condense down to **one** standard that actually makes sense to users. For example: I'm voting on calling a "wallet" a *Bitcoin Keychain* because that's what it actually is. 
* Same as previous point: ISO standardisation for "bits/millibits/mbtc/fuckwhat" is mandatory for industry adoption!
* Volatitlity (although also a key selling point)
* Bad press
* Misinformation by media
* Cognitive dissonance
* Butthurt for feeling "missing out"

VPS is made for high uptimes. Bitcoin nodes do not need 99.999% uptime (like, for example on Amazon). Strength in numbers!
SSD for the blockchain data is overkill and useless. A Bitcoin node is never going to reach the IOPS a normal 7200RPM SATA/SAS drive can reach. A normale RAID set of SAS/SATA disks or even with overhead on a NFS/ISCSI volume is more than enough.

I've been trying to think what the cause could be, and have come up with this;
**Early adopter whale**
What if some whale tried to "crash" the price to buy back lower, but the market was not acting like he thought, and the price started rising. He paniced, because he was in Fiat and the price started to rise above his selling price. With no other option (besides buying back his sold BTC, for a loss), he quickly moved 30k BTC onto stamp and just put it there. As a big "fuck you" but also to show he's still there.

Seems like a high-tier data center rate - Tier 2 or 3. Bitcoin is de-central, and does not need top-tier hosting. A 99,8% uptime is fine (Tier 1, or a shed). SSD for Bitcoin is totally overkill. The IOPS my Bitcoin nodes are handling are a laugh, the 15k Equillogic LUNs are handly hitting 25 IOPS, and that's 6 nodes running on a single iscsi LUN.
Also, we can fix the size with tree-chains, side-chains and pruning.

It's distributed accounting ledger. There is not 1 ledger, it's a blockchain of blocks. Not all nodes have the same ledger (called Orphaning). All ledgers are compared against eachother and the longest one (oversimplified) wins.

Very cool, like the packaging etc.
But something about the website is a bit weird. Maybe it's the English - or something. 
And compared to Trezor, which is open source, - this device requires me to trust you, that would mean I would not store more then $25 on there as a risk assessment.
Overall, very good job. Needs some fine-tuning.

See it as an alternative (hedge) against the centralised fiat money systems. And also a worldwide frictionless payment system. If you live in a country that has pretty good banking, and you don't need/want the features Bitcoin/bitcoins offer, maybe you don't need it.

Bad news, now Bitcoin (merchants, users, payment processors) need to comply to compliance rules when doing business with Bitcoin - the compliance rules however do not work in Bitcoin - hence compliance problems and risk.
This is like they are applying Horse rules to Cars - making Cars very hard to drive because they *can* go faster and the rules are impossible to follow.
This is bad news.

You would have to work on a donation model. But "begging" for Bitcoin is not allowed here. I would pay my share to someone to run a fat huge SSD  16GB gigabit Bitcoin node in a data center somewhere.
What would that cost? Like $50 a month?
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:08:52
This is looking at it wrong. That money is not debt, the money just isn't there. If you put money on the bank, you are "lending" it out to them, and they are doing fractional reserve banking - they openly admit they do not have 100% of all deposits available for withdrawal.
It's lend out, invested, etc....

Having a Creditcard transaction unable to reverse takes days to weeks. Bitcoin is hard to reverse with even 0-confirms. After a few confirms it is impossible to reverse.
Does that matter online (where Bitcoin is designed for)? No, because if you reverse the payment the merchant does not ship your package or cancels your service.
That's a big "if".
Sidechain tech will solve the offline PoS implementation.

Well, that is why Bitcoin is open source. 
A block is the "summary" of the last block - miners have to solve the next block, fitting on the last, or else they are going to not find a block.
Please read the whitepaper to understand: 
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:36:30
No need to have the whole blockchain to act as a wallet. Trezor does not contain the entire Blockchain - just acts like a sign. tool to sign TXID's. Full-node wallets are not needed for consumers anyway. Electrum style wallets are the way to go for consumers.

* The blockchain is a ledger of Inputs/outputs (3 move to John, 2 move to alice, 1 moves from Alice to Steve, etc).
* Every Output value on the blockchain is signed to a public address
* Only the owner of the address (the private key holder) can move the Output/Input value again
Mtgox was an "output exchange". You deposit bitcoin (outputs) to a Mtgox addres, you trade USD/Bitcoin, and you move BTC (Outputs) back to an address that you alone have the keys for.
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:38:58
Well the license does not state the "commercial" aspect as as requirement, just by conducting certain Business Activity acts you are to follow regulations. For example, if you are "controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency." - this does not have to be a commercial act........

7TPS limit is kinda like a car, stuck in first gear (by putting a piece of wood over the gearlever). Once removed, you can shift up.

You seem to be right, Electrum does not allow 0. You could change the code because it's just a GUI limitation to prevent users from having coins "stuck" for hours (0-fee could take up to 6 hours sometimes).
Bitcoin-qt allows this.

It's **never** worth it in the short run. It could be worth it once the aquired bitcoins gain value over time, **BUT** one would always have been better off just buying. (For example, mining with a GPU in 2010 would now be worth it, but buying in 2010 would have been better ROI).
This lack of mining does, by *tragedy of the commons* undermine the security of the blockchain, though. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:13:14
In theory, easy. But someone has to built it.
For example, the login for a VPS control panel, at a fictitious Acme Hosting Corp.
* I signup and link a certain Bitcoin address to my account at Acme Hosting Inc.
* When I want to login, I need to sign a (randomly) generated string with a time-limit.
* My (non-existing) BTCPassword wallet signs the string with it's private key. (message signing can already be done manually in Bitcoin-QT and Electrum)
* The Acme Hosting login API now knows it's really me (owning the private keys) (using verify message with their own blockchain backend).
This can also be extended by requiring a small 1-bit transaction to a certain address, or something like that.... possibly better on a side-chain (also still not live on the Bitcoin network).

Everything is life is a gamble, stocks, money, a new job. Bitcoin is a network io decentralized trust, not a pyramid scheme. There is no promise of wealth of any kind. It is what it is, a digital cash system - open and transparant.


Nope, it' s not. Go read the whitepaper.


Does it? What makes it fail? Last times I used bitcoins to buy stuff it went just the way it should. I pay funnymoney, merchant sends pizza/computer parts/food. 


No. No reason to explain it's not, because it's not.


True. But the same would apply for any "investment"  I'm investing to get rich when I'm buying AAPL on the downtrend, not  because I want them to have my money.


De-centralized trustless concensus on a peer-to-peer ledger system, secured by the world's fastest network of custom built hardware. Multi-signature security. Open-source programmable money. Need I go on?


Yes but that is not where bitcoins are made for. Bitcoin is made for the digital online age. Can you buy something digital, peer to peer, from around the world with little to no fees? Outside the Paypal world and tradional you simply can't. 


It's not a currency. It's digital cash.


That's the whole idea!


Worldwide peer-to-peer transactions without trust or a central authority? Seems pretty convenient to me!






Not inherent to the network or the protocol. Thugs are in every ecosystem. if a robber steals your wallet, does that make the USD unsafe? Regulation is coming (For example; NY Bitlicense).


Let me ask you; what would a 51% attack do? And why would a miner (who's return is dependent on bitcoin's survival)  attack it's own asset? Not that one could do a lot while having 51% - let alone the fact that miners leave the second a pool goes rogue.


They sold off a bunch instead of destroying it, so at least a few dollar, right? Why would I care if the US govt. values it or not, I don't live there. My govt. values bitcoins as "private money". (


True. Just I won't take Dollars from you if you want to buy my apples. Euro or bitcoins please.

True, for now. Without the 8333 they are stil a full node, but a broken one (not really helping, just sitting there idle).
Due to the nature of NAT breaking the inbound connection. When a IPv6 host runs bitcoin-qt they become a full node anyway (because IPv6 does not have NAT and every address is routable).

It's just a change to how to prioritize your transaction. Zero fee or just a few cents is still fine if you can "wait".

TLDR; Transactions are always a good "Who dunnit" - and by Ddosing nodes &amp; keeping proper logs it can get rather "easy" to discovery what IP adress has broadcasted a transactions into the P2P network.
This does not mean, however, that the *owner* of that IP address is the person *made* the transaction ergo owns the coins. It can be a public connection, a VPN, a botnet etc. Someone who wants to stay anon could always paste the TXID into blockchain.info or something alike.

* If they are a sidechain of Bitcoin, they are bitcoins by origin.

* If they are colored coins they need a blockchain at the bottom. Colored coins are considered altcoins (StorJX, Maidsafecoin, etc)

I don't have the time to read the whole thing, but I scanned through a little.


Mmm, 3rd party wallet hosters can make Bitcoin *more* safe.
Please look into Multisig - For instance 2-of-3. A "Bank" could host your 3rd key, and approve of any transaction you make or not (Risk assesment, 2Factor, etc). They cannot however steal your money because that would require 2 keys and only *the client* has the 3rd key offline in case of emergency.
That is how it works. you need X of Y keys (2-of-3 or 3-of-4, etc)
**Quote from your paper**


SHA256 is the mining algo, it does not secure the Wallet itself. That's ECDSA. 
 
A flaw in SHA256 would cause the mining to get more easy, and would adjust the difficulty with enough NONCE's so the network would remain OK. 
I will put more notes on this online later....

Too bad, you need wallet software. Or a hardware wallet.
If you look at  you can see all the "fancy" wallets, with all the options they give. Need a quick daily wallet on your phone? Might consider lowering the privacy, or maybe more counterparty risk (Hosted wallet), or maybe you want all the "fancy" features. It's all up to you.
Just click around on the different wallets and see what features **you** would want most. And go for it.
It's like the safety of your car. Want to keep your legs when crashing into a brick wall with your car? Get a hummer. Want to go fast? Get a Ferarri. Want both; get an Q7 Audi. But it's all going to cost you.


Imho, no. If it's just to try out, just use a simple wallet like Mycellium/Breadwallet on phone. Or Greenaddress on her desktop (prevents basic Virus threats because it's multisig *and* has a pretty good seed backup *and* has SMS 2FA).
Every use-case has a different wallet. 




Depening on what wallet she chooses. If she wants steel-belted security she'd have to invest in a Trezor. Very easy to use though.


That's because it's not ready for mainstream ("Granny") adoption yet. Last year it was even worse, now we have hardware wallets, some pretty good multisig with 2FA wallets and even wallets op iOS (used to be banned...)

Coinbase is not a real wallet. It's an exchange. You can use it as a makeshift wallet, but you don't really own the bitcoin in there (coinbase has the keys).

Would it be an idea to make kind of a "micro kickstarter" style goals that people specifically can donate to? So like 50 different "goals" to donate to. This also gives to donator some feedback when the goal is reached (email with maybe a link to the blogpost, etc).
Examples might be *"0.5BTC needed for a new PS3 for the leisure room"* or *"5BTC needed for 18 new beds in the parents room"* or *"1 BTC needed to redecorate the lobby"*.

You are using Bitcoin-QT? That takes a loooong time to sync. It's the wallet for developer use and not really for normal use.
Now that you already have your bitcoins tied up in the wallet that you could also choose to just wait or download the torrent file.
Shutdown the wallet. Place the bootstrap.dat in the bitcoin data dir, and start the wallet. It will get up to sync in a matter of 30 minutes.
Torrent for bootstrap: 
Edit: Now that I re-read your post: Are you sure the bitcoins are sent to an address in the bitcoin-qt wallet? Or to a blockchain.info webwallet? If the latter: Uninstall bitcoin-qt and use electrum. transfer the coins from blockchain webwallet to one of the addresses electrum gives your. *Write down the seed on a piece of paper and keep it very safe!*

Ok Sir, but that's not all, besides all these options there is, last but not least we have an option for you that does not cost any fee so your entire donation ends up with Wikipedia!:

Money is the thing we use to pay things. You can work, and give money to an other someone for doing work. Dad can work and get money, and pay someone else to do other work.
A long time ago we used very pretty things as money, but that was hard to do because they were very big and it was hard to think how much one thing would be money against the other.
Then came a time we used paper money that was made by a single group of people that made more and more and more. They made that money so much that is started to become less and less.
You still have that in your pocket. But on the computer this is hard to send because you can not send a paper money over the computer. So now we have computer money.

Yes! Great idea. 
Actually, the blockchain is just this
    [network number] [length] [block header] [block transactions]
    [network number] [length] [block header] [block transactions]
    [network number] [length] [block header] [block transactions]
    ... repeat for all blocks
So you would need;
* A blockheight indicator - the system needs to determine how high the blockheight is (currently we are at block 324509).
* A method of placing a query for a missing block (for example; I need block 324501 to 324509 because I was offline for a few hours - please give it to me).
* You could use mkbootstrap.py to create small "segments" of the enite bitcoin chain.

It's an open ledger that can tie your identity to a transaction, now or in the future (when even one of your business partners in crime leaks your private info linking you to your addresses).
For example, 10 years from now that shady deal for 1000 ACME Anvils that were stolen is still logged in the blockchain. You partner's partner is cought, his wallet compromised and becaue he used weak security in his metadata they have *your* name now. And also your address. 
The blockchain is essentially a piece of evidence that can and will be used against illicit actors in the future.
This makes Bitcoin very unsuitable for crime, because the blockchain never forgets.
For crime, cash is king.

Pretty much. You can cut it up in multiple pieces though. or store it at multiple locations.


Don't do that. The idea is that you keep the seed *offline*. It will never leave the Trezor in digital form.


You'll find out that Trezor does this. Just keep the seed safe, or learn it in your head (would not advice this).
Otherwise, use paper wallets.

Blockchain.info is not the same as the Blockchain itself. BLockchain.info is a webwallet hoster. BLockchain itself it the Bitcoin tech.
Anyway, a normale semi-secure Windowsm achine with 2FA should be pretty ok, but I would research Trezor and Offline (multisignature) wallets if we are talking any reasonable amount of bitcoins.
Afaik I know blockchain uses a single bitcoin address. This is not the best-pratice security model. You should never delete private keys though. You never know when you need them.

@_date: 2014-12-12 11:04:03
Less with a Trezor/Ledger wallet.
Also, it's all about security models. If you only use the Windows machine as a Multibit wallet, and maybe even keep it offline (updates will be a problem, but ok), it would be more secure than a Linux system you use every day and install/run random binary/bash/perl stuff on....

What I meant was : Once you buy a considerable amount of Bitcoin you need to read into security etc. - $10 is fine but it would be a bummer if you would lose $1000 worth of Bitcoin.
To awnser your cents question, Bitcoin is like this:
1 Bitcoin = 1000 mbit = 1000 bits (or ubits) = 100 satoshi
So 1000 bits is about $0.60 worth.

Yes, well Bitcoin is a network of computers running Bitcoin software. Mining is the calculation of the next " block" of Bitcoin on the network. It takes a certain amount of calculation so that you at home cannot fake a block.
This uses electricity, but that also prevents someone from doing an attack - He/she would have to use a lot of resources (miners) and electricity.
Any questions, just ask. :)

A 51% can't destroy Bitcoin. They can stop transactions going through for as long as they keep 51% of the hashing power. Once they loose 51% the network goes on.
They can't spend coins that they don't own, they can't destroy coins. They can only reverse their own transactions (a few blocks back).

Even with 51% it's not possible to fake transactions, that is not how the blockchain works. In order to move Bitcoin a ECSDA hash has to be signed by a private key - one cannot fake this.

But so is every tech - Should you mention illicit use for cars, cameras, phones, the internet, etc? Only if it's used primarily for this (Like, for example, the Silk Road - It's primary use is illicit, not legit).
Cash is way better for criminal purposes. The blockchain keeps your transactions, forever. Not a good use case for criminal use.

No. Addresses are generated from a large random number generated by your browser. Therefore, private keys are non-deterministic. This means you do not have to backup or remember an additional seed. However, if you lose your encryption password there is no way recover your keys.

They are accepting (API) and enabling transactions (memory pool). Not saying it's illegal, just something a govt. can attack full nodes on.
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:07:17
Infinity. A full node does not have to mine to secure the network (against DDOS). Securing the network is something else then securing the blockchain itself. Think about block propagation, storage, redundancy, latency, block-source, memory-pool, etc.
Also, USD bills can be printed into infinity, while bitcoins are set to a fixed limit. For centuries. So you know that 1 BTC = 1 BTC

So a rogue miner has 51% of mining power, and changes the protocol. The 49% remaining miners will keep mining "Bitcoin classic" while the 51% attacker will have forked away.
The 49% chain will have value (because all unpatched Bitcoin "classic" nodes wille accept the blocks, and the 51% won't. He will be mining into nothingness. You really, really misunderstand how mining/bitcoin works.

I'm not relatively new, I understand nodes are important for mining and compiling transactions, but besides that, what do nodes do?
Serve the memorypool. Upload blocks to other nodes that are not up-to-date. Spread blocks that are mined by mining nodes


A more stable memory pool and faster syncs. Less prone to DDOS.


The network would be prone to DDOS and it would also be slow slow slow.

When I was actively mining I would monitor the price - if it would drop far below my "cost to mine"  I would buy some, because at the end of the day I wanted to aqquire bitcoins - and if they are cheaper to buy than to mine - arbitrage!
Miners would be silly to invest thousands of USD when people are trowing BTC for cheap on the exchanges. Up to a certain threshold of volume of course. It's not like it's in a pegged state.

Luke, I respect you as a Dev and for the good amount of work you did and still do for Bitcoin.
It's not enforced, but it is default/ I would say most users using Gentoo are not compiling packages themself or changing flags. They rely on neutral devs making proper vanilla packages. 
Bitcoin should be neutral and blacklisting any entity should not be good practice. 
Again, I agree that SD spams the blockchain, but blacklisting is not going to make them go away. Let the (mining) market solve this - once miners stop including spam into the chain it will solve itself. They don't pay the proper fee.

The avg. computer in the world is, at this moment, either turned off or using "idle" power only (1 to 10%). If they started to mine they would use 90% more power.
There would not be enough power on the grid on the planet to make all the computers run at 100% - it would fail.
But, for the sake of *fun* let's calculate it anyway. 
* Fact: There are around 2 billion computers on the planet. 
* If we avarage out all the crappy stuff and the high end we end up around, let's say, a Intel i3.
* An Intel i3 does around ~~20~~ 5 Mhash/s. 
* We end up with 2,000,000,000 computers times 5 mhash = **10,000,000,000 Mhash/s** for all computers on the planet mining at the same time.
* That's **10,000,000 Ghash/s**
* The Bitcoin network is currently (28-nov 2014) at **250,000,000 Ghash/s**
**TLDR; all the computers in the world would mine at about 4% of the hashrate of the Bitcoin network.**
**TLDR2; The Bitcoin network is a scary monster**

You would have to transfer Bitcoin to the exchange first, and they would know 51% is going on (this is monitored) and they would possibly disable

Well, not 100% of the nodes can collude. Just like some pools don't mine big blocks, excluding "some" output won't work, eventually some miner will mine it into a block and you would have to race that block *and* the next to not get orphaned.
You don't need nodes for this - you need mining power.

Storing data in the blockchain is not possible. It is however possible to make a lot of "fake" transactions what with a special program could "read"  this as data. Clog: Yes a bit, but it will get more and more costly to store large amounts of pseudodata.

A mining pool does not control the actual mining *power* of the pool/network. Once they go rogue, the miners will leave.
50% does not do anything actually, except delay and put the network on pause, and destroy one's reputation as a pool/mining company.
What is the scenario?
* Get 51% 
* Double spend $5000 USD and/or DDos the network putting it on hold essentially.
* Get detected by the whole community, scrutinised, piss Bitcoiners off, reputation gone.
* .....?????????
* Profit?
51% does not allow you to spend other people's money.

Yes. A simple PentiumM with 512 or better 1 GB mem will do fine. You could even run it without the gui (using --text-mode when starting Electrum). Boottime will be around 3 minutes without an SSD but this is your "bank vault" so you don't use it daily.
If you are a bit into GNU/Linux you could also use Debian + a desktop manager like KDE/Xorg it has less overhead than Ubuntu.
As a hotwallet  or day to day spamming/buying/showing off Bitcoin you could use Android (Mycellium wallet) or iPhone (Hive/Greenaddress/Breadwallet).

Bitcoin is P2P. It's rather hard to isolate the payment processor's nodes entirely.
If you have 100% control of a node, you'd have to act quick - it would also no longer get any blocks from the actual network and that would be noticed.
It's called a Sybil attack.
Also, there's always a "leak" from one of the nodes, especially because the it's N:N not 1:N.

This is not the cost of keeping the network secure, this is the (not adjusted for selling pressure) emitted rewards of the blockchain.
The costs of running the entire Bitcoin network, manhours included, is much higher.
The most important thing to consider is: Do the miners keep (and how much) part of the BTC as "currency" or do they really need to sell off.

If, for instance, someone makes a payment to an old address you once gave them, the coin would be gone forever. Just making sure you dont loose coins because of (my) bad advice.

A normal, fee included transactin up to about $25 is fairly safe to accept without confirm. It takes a whole lot of preperation to even try to pull off a zero-confirm double spend. I think about 10 seconds and proper propagation inspection of the memory pool (this is what Bitpay does) is just fine.
Bitpay payments are 0-confirm also, I order takeaway every 2 weeks and it's always 0-confirm pizza.

If it was low energy, it would be very easy to mine - hence - more people would mine with more machines until it reaches equilibrium. No, in order for PoW to work it needs to be expensive.
Fun fact: ASICS made mining very, very low power (1:10,000) compared to a CPU or GPU. That did not stop the network from consuming more power.
There is more than enough power available from the sun to keep the human race alive, and a tiny percentage of that being used to secure a global ledger is not going to break our planet. 
Wastefulness comes from using energy for something that does nothing to make humanity better: Inefficient cars, burning coal for power and not utilising existing tech to make us more energy efficient.
For example: A lightbulb that is lighting a street while no-one is there has zero value, at least the mining rig is securing the blockchain, while the bulb has no intrinsic utility for any human.
We have more than enough power - there is a Fusion reactor in the sky at less then 1 AU from earth. What we do need to be mindful of is resources like metals and natural gas/oil - those will run out and we need to make the transition to harvesting the power of our sun (wind, solar, etc) before that happens.

The blockchain is like a huge room with vaults (addresses). everyone has (private) keys, and you can move the coins from your vault to someone else's with your keys. Once you move them they are out of your control.
Coinbase does not give you the keys, they host a wallet where they let your move the coins, but you do not get to see the keys.
So if they go away (like mtgox) you do not have the keys - hence - no bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:28:14

* Bitcoin's price (lower price = easier to corrupt miners)
* Hashrate
* Pool distribution
* Price of the transaction to be "reversed"

A drop in hashrate will indeed cause delays in confirmation. But I don't think there is a single enitity with enough hashing power to do this.
Also, they would sell the miner units won't they? they would have to have at least a  couple of 1000 Antminer S3 or bigger miners make the confirmation drop from 600 seconds to weeks.
Also, the network **will** adjust downwards, if needed.

Europe just woke up. There were multiple events in the Amsterdam region (including DNB - the Dutch FED - attending and speaking). Also a Bitcoin event hosted by ABN Bank ( Large dutch bank) and the ING Bank (Another BIG bank, worldwide even) top management was also speaking on stage.
Proof:  - 
Bonus: Mr Jan Kees de Jager was there. He is the previous Secretary of the Treasury of the Netherlands. He was not negative about Bitcoin (but warned about its use due to volatility) and even admitted he owned bitcoins. 
I kid you not. I've been buying like crazy ever since.

Weird. It's rather hard for me to troubleshoot remotely, and Tails is kinda custamized a a lot so not comparable to distros I run.

@_date: 2014-07-07 08:30:37
You can safely carry 21K worth of Bitcoin on you, but there are some security best practices. One of those would be: Once you have 21K in a "Hot-wallet" with you; don't plug that laptop into an unknown network.
...If you *do* want this, at least harden the OS (proper AV/Firewall - not some freeware but a decent one.). I would recommend a Multisig wallet like Trezor as an semi-mandatory security solution. Bitcoin tech is still in it's Beta/Infancy and hardware multisig wallets are hard to get.
A totally different aprouch would be using something like Xapo.com - I do however have some mixed feelings about this. They have a proper 2FA security model, but you would not "Be your own bank" - i.e. the spirit of Bitcoin is a bit lost. For a consumer/grandmother/IT-illiterate this might (*might*) be a "better" solution.
**TLDR; Bitcoin security takes a lot of work and if/then/must/should. It's hardly ready for mass-adoption.**

I've never seen Anxpro before. They might be legit, but beware. If you are in SEPA zone EU I would recommend Kraken.com. Once you sent Eur. it shows up pretty quikc (withdrawls are 24 hours).
Once you have bought your coins you should indeed **not** store them on a hosted webwallet or anything. Research cold storage or use a very secure computer (Linux is preferred above a Windows machine) to store your coins. Don't forget to backup. I would recommend buying an old laptop, put Ubuntu Linux on it and use it as a dedicated wallet for now.
To answer your question: Yes you can and should move the coins to your own wallet asap after you are done with trading. 
I recommend Electrum client because of the easy paper-seed recovery key.
Also put a password on the backups.

Not trusting, assuming until proven broken. 


Yes, because the mining/network does not allow invalid transactions.


That actor is could be, most likely, a mining pool operator. It does not mean they *own* the hashing power. Once they abuse the hashing power (not much they can really do though) all the miners leave.
51% attack cannot spend bitcoins you do not own, or anything nasty. Just delay transactions. An alert will be send out if this ever happens putting the network on "hold".  They also have to remain at 51% the entire time for the "halt" to be successfull. That's burning through a lot of money....

Hi! Welcome. Bitcoin Core just takes a loooong time to sync in the normal way. It's over 20GB of data.
You would be better off using a SPV client like Electrum or Multibit. If you really need Core (for dev, or tinkering) I would advise you to download the Bootstrap file and shutdown Core client, and place it into the data dir (%appdata%\Bitcoin in windows)
It will sync up to speed very very fast.

Ask or Bid? Those values are limits.
If you put out an ask price *limit* of 3600 you end up at the bottom the orderbook. If you bid with *limit* 3600 it will eat the volume of your order at the Ask prices instantly. So the cheapest coins first.

Think the other way around: Why would it happen **and** stay 51% for a long time?
Miners are not going to destroy Bitcoin - It's their investment at stake. The mining power is not controlled by large mining pools, merely "administered".
If a pool starts behaving badly with its miner's hashing power, miners will leave that pool. Simple.

No it's not. The effectiveness is not measured in USD - this is not a business case. The effectiveness is measured in how much material we remove in a certain time-delta.
If it costs 100 trillion USD to remove all plastic in 10 seconds, that is still effective, but insanely costly.

They need enough Bitcoin to keep moving bitcoins around. You can't re-send bitcoin before it verifies a few blocks so they need to buy.
    Amount of coins needed = Minimal amount (5300) * TPS * 12 blocks 
So they need 5300 sat * 7 tps * 7200 seconds = 267,120,000 satoshi.
So they can keeping FIFO'ing the coins round and round. But it's eating up fees, so they need to buy these up-front ($60M like you said).
Thats only a few mBTC + $60M in fees to keep spamming the blockchain fo 6 months.

DTMF is the "bleep bloops" that you hear when you press the keys on your phone. So a phone connection is needed. The relay-node that takes your DTMF transaction just host a phone number (555-1235) and you enter the DTFM, and he pushes it onto the blockchain. He could just ask $0.10 per minute (host a telephone number/service).
The offline wallet does need unspent outputs, that could be either cached, or receiver via DVB radio (see opening post). Or you could generate an offline transaction of a paper wallet that is known to be unspent.

Depends on the definition of a micropayment.
The Bitcoin network itself is not ready for micropayments below, imho, 50 cents worth. The fees would eat up too much of the tip/payment and it would spam the blockchain.
You could use an altcoin like Litecoin or Dogecoin to Peer-to-Peer tipping, and auto-convert to Bitcoin every time the balance reaches a few dollars worth. 
Then there are services. For example "changetip" is a pretty good system to make it work, but it does require some third party trust. Chanegtip allows for "off chain" micropayments that are bundles to your wallet later on.

Nothing is impossible. Bruteforcing SHA256 is also possible, just (like you said) difficult.
An attack is also improbable, the PoW makes it economically (almost) impossble to break. Once you have 51% of the hashing power, you cannot break the network, only Ddos (by not mining transactions). You cannot revert  mined blocks or spent other people's coins. Also, the alert key will be raised and everyone will know you are messing around.
An attacker would have to burn millions of USD a day to keep this state. Once he runs out of money the network will continue.
If you are not impressed by this, well. That's a personal matter. I think the network will keep running for 10s or 100s of years. there will be hiccups but general failure is not going to happen. (Except of non-protocol related scandals like Mtgox).
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:47:30

* So one of these USB miners is 0.3Gh/s. 
Hashrate of the network is 100,000,000 Gh/s
* Say we want to get 10% of the network, that's 10,000,000Gh/s
* We would need to get 33,333,333 units.
* They use about 5 watts (USB miners are not so efficient). &gt; That that's 166 Megawatt/h of power usage.
* Every single one of those PC's has to be ON in order to let the USB dongle miner
* A simple PC uses about 40 watt/h of power. Let's say 1 PC will have 10 dongles. 
The grand total of power is 133+166 = 299 MEGAWATT/h. And you have 10% of the network.

From a security perspective: A long password is needed for "raw" access to files. Like a Zipfile or a Bitcoin wallet.
A webservice does not provide instant access or gives you unlimited trials to "crack" the password. With proper heuristics a 4 digit "passcode" is fine.
A bruteforce attacker would be blocked after 3 attempts, and the backend system could flag the account as " under attack" and lock out suspicious IP addreses.
*"But what about keyloggers?"*
When we look at the attack vector for keyloggers sniffing your password, it does not really matter if the password is *4321* or *nevergoingtocrackthisentropy123@
So, it's kinda ok. 
TLDR; For cryptographic security: Long passwords. For GUI front-ends (indentification): Short can be ok, if/when etc.

1. To exchanges only? That is already the case. All major exchanges ask for ID, selfie, etc.
2. Not going to work - The reference client is not Bitcoin - the protocol is re-written in a lot of different clients. Wanting devs to becoma liable only creates *more* problems (devs going underground).
3. Already the case. *financially reimburse* does not mean "Get all your BTC back" - Even gox is being liquidized (although I don't think more then 10% of BTC value is going to be paid).

I made this earlier, for my nephew who wanted to know. 
*Bitcoin: Explained avoiding technical terms.*
So Bitcoin is a network of computers. Running software that has certain rules. Rules like "This much" etc.
All Bitcoin computers have a big file of transactions. It's like a big book with millions of rows. Every 10 minutes there is a new row added to the big book. It has to start with a certain number, and this takes a lot of thinking by the computers to make.
This big book is the blockchain. The computers are mining.
So each 10 minutes there is a new block. It contains all transactions - like John paying Jill for a Pizza - of that 10 minutes.
All the miners are like really boring office workers, checking if the first to solve the puzzle is actually legit.
If anyone tries to raise his finger and call out a false puzzle, they are ignored. This process secures the blockchain from double spending coins you do not have or you already used.
Once a miner solves a block they get 25 bitcoins - out of thin air * for being such a nice lad and helping the network yet another 10 minutes.
If too much computers join the numbers get bigger and bigger - this is to limit the amount of coins according to the rules of the protocol.
Why is it worth something? Because it's an open, honest system of tokens that cannot be faked. Once you hold bitcoins, you know how the rules are.
One of the rules is:
*There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins*

The **major** problem here is this: A lot of companies that now take Bitcoin (Dell, etc.) and have Russian branches will now get an email from their compliance/legal dept. - This can be quite a risk to a company - The risks involved of accepting Bitcoin to/from a Country that is banning it (with fines) may outweight the extra profit/markting they make.

I would categorize them as followed - in a Western country.
* 1. People who have never (as far as they cal recall) heard the word Bitcoin: **About 50%**
* 2. People who have heard the word Bitcoin, and know it has something to do with value or internet, but are otherwise clueless (f/a: my granny) **About 30%**
* 3. People who do know, to some extend, what Bitcoin is and either are positive, neutral or are haters **About 15%**
* 4. People who know how Bitcoin works behind the scenes, understand the dynamics and are either neutral, hate it or love it **About 1%**
The last category can also be split into 2 groups: People who hold, or don't hold Bitcoin.  Some people in Cat 3. also hold Bitcoin, mostly 100% speculators just riding along for the profit. (No problem with that).
If you would shift your focus to a 3rd world country: I would say 99% has never even heard the word Bitcoin in their life.

Yes, Ghash will 51% attack the network, because all miners will totally be fine with that and keep mining there. I even think more miners will join Ghash when they start attacking to really finish it off. That is totally logical.

Not really, I think. Once a few miners mine a couple of blocks with the new "forked" size, it's very hard for the other miners to catch up. The longest chain wins, so they will either fall behind or don't mine any block anymore.

Besides the fact that a) this implies massive economic consequences and b) will be impossible to do (there will always be a single link through sat. possible, so it won't break bitcoin, at least).
Let's say they manage to cut off the entire internet. 100%.  The blockchain would keep existing on both sides, but they won't have 51% of the mining power.  Blocks will be solved but the fork that is created is shorter then the fork outside of Russia, so the second they re-join, that fork is dead.
Essentially it puts the Bitcoin network on hold, for Russians . They can still do transactions (pushing out TXids) if they really want to, because you don't need internet for that (HAM radio, SMS, Sat., Fax or even by telephone would still work).

Ok so you have .com and .org domains, right?
Namecoin has a seperate TLD extension called .bit.
registrations are not done by calling the ICANN (they manage the .com domain, so reddit.com for example).
* Open and Free .bit DNS system - anyone with namecoin can register a .bit domain
* Decentral DNS system, no possible way to take down.
* Very good security - changing a DNs record requires the owner's private key (like bitcoin)
* Merge mined by Bitcoin miners - "Free" hashing power secures the Namecoin blockchain so almost impossible to 51% attack. Merge mining = *"Oh I a mining Bitcoin already, might as well check every hash for Namecoin too, while I'm at it"*
* Not yet routed by top-level DNS servers - So you need to tell your router where to look or use a proxy
* Kind of obscure at the moment.
You can trade them for Bitcoin at most exchanges. They are worth about $1.70

500,000 BTC is not even traded at the exchanges right now. And even if they did, in my example, they would have exhausted all those BTC's in fees. And Bitcoin would be fine.
* Buy 500k BTC in bulk
* "Spam" the network (causing a few days of inconvenience, possibly some hardfork/patch to fix the problem if needed). 
* ....?
* Profit!

Nice idea. Some quick ideas I would like to see if possible :)

* Dust removal tools (
* Privatekey management.
* Change address management (view used, future and past).
* Multiple wallet files support (just like phpmyadmin has multi-server/db support).
* Read only wallets?

No it's not. It's better if most (or a lot) of users run a full node, but you running Bitcoin-QT for a few hours a day does nothing to help the network. Either be online 24/7 or just use a consumer wallet like Electrum or Multibit.

An idea I had for some time: *Instacoin*.
Situation: Alice wants to pay Bob. But Bob does not want to wait for the confirms, wants instant spendable bitcoins.
**So** they use Instacoin. Alice sends $1.50 in bitcoins to an instacoin address (regular bitcoin address) made by Bob. Instacoin monitors and does the spoof/doublespent checks and makes sure the transaction is not able to revert, etc. 
Instacoin sends a pre-made privkey (or set of privkeys) that makes up the total amount spent (an address containing a $1 address but also a $0.50 one) to the API side of Bob' s "Instacoin-enabled" wallet, and they are immediately available for spending. Bob could spend the bit coins, or move them to an address so that Instacoin can no longer move them (if they were to be rogue).
* immediately spendable bitcoin
* less risk on taking 0-confirms
* Instacoin provider has small risk of hackers trying to double spent
* small fee required by instacoin provider
* counterparts risk for Bob from the moment he receives keys to the moment he moves them on (or to his cold storage)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:58:57
Not if you don't re-use an address that has been used for signing a transaction more than once.

Never invest, especially in something experimental like Bitcoin, more than you can afford to lose.
Bitcoin could come out as a very well working international, like it's looking pretty healthy at the moment, even with all the scammers trying to lure you into scams.
But on the other hand, it could fail due to bugs (not very likely, but never say never) or a harsh crackdown by Goverments (won't work, but that's another story).
Just see it as a hobby. Do your homework, learn how Bitcoin works and if you think it is wise to be part of the experiment you could put some money in.
Good luck! here's $2 worth to experiment with./

As long as Bitcoin-qt remains stable that is not a problem. It's a protocol not a "software" suite

As long as ECDSA does not break, not really a problem. We had major bugs before. Bring it.

A dust-transaction without fee does stay in the memory pool for long. 
Billions of spam bots? If 1 billion spam bots want to sent 1 transaction to themselfs, they need to pay at least 0.0005 BTC fee (for a dust transaction, this can be lower, but lets take 1 transaction per bot).
1,000,000,000 * 0.0005 BTC = 500,000 BTC !
So half a million Bitcoin to sent. Do you really think govts have those amounts of Bitcoin to spam the blockchain?

* Can you ping an external IP? Like 8.8.8.8 if so, but not google.com it might be a DNS problem
* Is IPv6 disabled on the PC with the problem?
* Do you have software firewall on the affected PC that could be the culprit? 
* try a netsh reset maybe (never hurts) (run as admin, in dos box)
    netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt
**More questions for troubleshooting.**
* Can you still ping the router LAN side? Guess you can.
* Last: can the other computers still use internet while the problem occurs? 
* How often does it happen? If every hour: Does the same thing happen with a cable connected? (to rule out the Wifi hardare/drive/ipstack).

The crypto currency ecosystem is not ready for these things yet. Bitcoin itself is hardly mature and stable enough as a long-term store of value, let alone micro transactions.

Not really. I use Bitcoin almost 2 two times a week and it's pretty much standard to pay 0-confirm (Takea-away orders, restaurants, pubs, hosting, etc).
Now, most of those use professional API's to monitor transactons (Bitpay) and those enable you to accept 0 confirms.
In the case of Trezor I seem to remember they use a very simple Bitcoin checkout system. The 6-hour "confirm" is just the guys checking the transactions semi-manually is my guess.
Does it, in this case, really matter though? It's not like they are Amazon Prima - they probably ship once a day.

@_date: 2014-10-14 21:40:37
Yes. it is. And the miners actually move your transaction once every 10 minutes. Indede Coinbase holds the SDB key. 
You can move BTC if you own the private keys (SDB key) to any address you want. If you own the privkeys to that address you can move them again, if not, only the person that has the keys can move it again.
it's like digital gold. once out of your hands, it's gone. Once stored at a pawn shop (coinbase - they are a good company, but just to make the comparison)- you risk theft/loss.

It works like this (non-technical);
* You own an address in the blockchain, where you will sign upon
* The document is shredded to a pulp, and a very special "key" is made that is like the fingerprint of the file.
* This fingerprint is "embedded"  on the blockchainlinked  to your address.
* You now own the address, time and fingerprint of the file.
If, in a year time, someone would claim they had the file first, you could show them wrong. Because it's embedded in the blockchain in the past, and cannot be faked or changed.

When you (a bank/trade company/liq. provider) and your trusted banking partner need to push hundreds of thousand of transactions a day, it makes sense to combine them every hour or so. The risk of both parties is limited to that hour. The risk involved is way smaller then paying huge amounts of fees over time/
Bitcoin is not made and not suitable (at the moment) for micro transactions, those should happen offchain or by using alts.

Mining rewards. Miners already get paid fees (somewhere around 0.1% per transaction). Once the last block is mined Bitcoin is either very successful (and fees cover the mining costs), or not.
If not - well miners will leave and the network diff. will go down: If it goes down enough, you might even start to mine with your laptop again.
Imho, won't happen though.

You mine 51%. You read out the memorypool (where people broadcast the transaction ids). You do not mine other people's txid's.
Things you can do once you are 51%
* You stop mining them into blocks. People get annoyed because transactions do not confirm. 
* You can reverse your own transactions, to a few blocks back. 
* You will find most blocks on the network, so you end up 
with 25BTC per block.
Things you can't do
* spent coins you do not own.
* reverse other people's transactions (except reverse them a few blocks back).
Once you loose 51% party is over, and other miners can also find blocks again.
Doing 51% at current hashrate would cost you a few 100k USD per day to maintain. The only reward would be a crashing bitcoin price. And making a lot of devs, miners, users and hackers very angry.

Bitcoin is not going to kill banks. Bitcoin is protocol, it cannot replace the services a bank provides. Savings... maybe.

US people might not realise this, but there are EU laws that forbid taxing of sales or limiting movement of products and people between EU borders. So if I drive over to Germany and buy something, there is "Freedom to roam, for products and people" - So no taxing when bringing stuff home order ordering online. Taxes are paid to the merchant IN the country where the seller is  located. 
So no "Bitlicense" crap like NewYork (or any US state) has. If any EU country decides "Bitcoin is VAT free" - it's VAT free for the whole union.
This news is, if true, by far the biggest news this week for EU citizens.

You mean the big ' ol hardfork? Bitcoin was tiny back then, and almost no-one was harmed. Forks happen, and will happen again. How controlled/uncontrolled they will be is unknown, but devs/community learned a lot the last time. The alert key was raised during the hours the fork was there (Satoshi built this in) but nevertheless a lot of people still used the network. They got reverted, and I don't see why this would taint Bitcoin in such a way that is does not have right to exist.

A wallet is either a piece of software, a piece of paper or the file the software uses that containts your keys.
A wallet can contain multiple keys.
The private key is what makes your wallet your **wallet** - it is the key to the bitcoins "inside".
Fun fact: Bitcoins do not exist "in" your wallet, they are on the blockchain. You wallet has the keys to move them around (spent, move, collect, merge, etc).
Edit: To clarify, in your example case: Your wallet is bitcoin-qt (guessing). The wallet.dat is what makes the wallet YOUR wallet. It contains 100s of keys (in advance). If you are using bitcoin-qt then you really really have to backup the **file** not try to export keys.
Bitcoin uses change addreses (moves remaining balance of each transaction to a new address). 
TLDR; Put a password on that wallet.dat and back it up to USB. It is now good for 100 transaction in the future.

Miners mine. But nodes distribute your transactions across the memory pool of the entire network, and they verify transactions. They also mark "bad" nodes that are misbehaving. If there are not enough nodes but a mining pools, you reach a race-condition and orphan blocks can happen.

Yes. Bitcoin is using a lot of power to stay secure. But it's not wasted, it's all used for securing the blockchain.
Fun fact:
Even at 80MW - 80,000 kW/h - at $0.15 per kWh, the power usage is $12,000 per hour or about $288,000 per day.
So with 3600 coins mined per day, the reward for keeping the blockchain secure, the power at least, is $80 per coin. (sans the hardware).

With blockchain you can do decentralized autorization. (for example I tell the simcard it needs to see an "OK" every 100 blocks. If not; lock out.

First, Bitcoin itself does hardly use encryption: It uses hashing. Second, Quantum computers still function inside the realm of physics that currently exist. It's physically impossible to even count to 2^160 without exhausting more power than our sun emits. Just counting; 1,2,3,4,........ all the way up to 2^160. You won't even reach 0.00001% in a lifetime with all computers in the world.
What could be dangerous, is re-using Bitcoin addresses. Once you use an address (spent) you sign with the privkey. A quantum computer could, in theory, cause determining the privkey somewhat possible.
Don't re-use addresses.

Agreed, Bitcoin is a bit ahead of its time. The internet has seen huge paradigm shifts in the way we communicate, do business, meet, live, etc - but one thing remains rather traditional: The way we see/make/transfer money. It's still a hodgepodge of trusted parties, processors, institutions, etc...
Bitcoin tries to solve the double spending problem that was bothering other forms of digital "cash" (like E-Gold). It's more of a digital asset then a payment system. No, it's a protocol - programmable money.
Bitcoin is still Beta and highly experimental. The problem it solves is not something we very much need now - the internet of things (marketing) is still not deeply embedded in our lives, but one day we will need a decentralised, international, standardised way to distribute, secure and send money like Bitcoin is experimenting with.


* No borders.
* Worldwide frictionless, cheap to use, (Bitcoin does not discriminate or exclude- if that's good or bad we will learn)
* It's instant to send, and takes up to about 1 hour to become absolutely irreversible.
* Fairly fair distribution (it takes energy and manhours to be rewarded bitcoins). There are no shortcuts.
* It's a-moral - religion, opinion or censurism have no place on the blockchain.
* Technical features like: Multi-signature transactions, Time-locks, Sidechains, etc.
My 2 cents on the matter.

You'd run out of IP / heuristics very soon. A simple IP detection alone would limit your bruteforce (if the security implementation, for instance, logs if you login more then once from a) the same IP b) with the wrong password.
    
    if ($ip = hasbeenseen("last 2 hours") AND wrong_password){
        flagip($IP, rogue)
    }
    if ($ip = used_by_more_then_one account){
        flagip($IP, rogue)
    }
And more and more in a more prof. way, you end up with a pretty good countermeasure against any brute force front-door attack. maybe even honeypot the attacker so he thinks he's attacking but is just talking to the honeypot.

Uhm. RAID-0 has a 200% failure risk, because if one of the two disks fails the raidset is degraded but also disrupted. At least use RAID-1 or RAID-5. Anything stored on a RAID-0 set should be only there for performance (Qurum disks, swap, DB transactions, provisioned VM's, etc).
Are you really going to use this as an argument against Bitcoin? Because that is kind of lame.

They have a choice to mine Bitcoin-old or Bitcoin-new. But they don't decide what both coins are worth at market price. If the market decides that Bitcoin-new is $250 and Bitcoin-old (on some exchange that does not upgrade) $0.01 then they'd have to be really ballsy to keep mining at a huge loss.

Does not work. 21M is hardcoded.
If miners change it, the blocks will get mined, but not accepted by the network. They will fork away from network, and most miners will keep mining on the orignal 21M bitcoin blockchain. The 22M-Bitcoin chain fees will be worthless and unspendable (and coinbase (not the company, the blockchain reward) completely unspendable). The less miners, the more the network will drop in speed. A manual diff-change could be arranged if this leads to trouble.

The most terrible thing that can happen to a botnet is getting discovered. Each node that drops weakens the botnet. The problem with GPU mining is that a) the machine graphics drop like shit (a lot in gaming) and b) the fan/temp runs VERY high (95c easy).
The user will notice. He will start looking for the reason - aka - the node will be cleaned by IT staffing or by himself.
In my calulation above I took a high-end GPU - most GPU's only mine about 10 to 30Mh/s - so you need a *lot* more nodes before even making a few cents.
Game consoles (like a PS3) mine around 18Mh/s - that's terribly slow. Also; you can't really infect a playstation yet.
So like you said - I know nothing?

You are using NAT to translate 8333 to the inside of your network. You NAT router needs to keep a table of source and dest. IP addreses to do so. I've seen crappy Linksys routers bug out on bitcoin nodes because of the high amount of (small) connections. 
Next time try to unplug your node from the router, and back in. The mac&amp;arp table resets and so will the nat table. 
If that works, you need a better router.

You earn them by selling stuff for bitcoins, like lemonade. 
Mining is part of understanding how the blockchain works. The blockchain is the important stuff of Bitcoin. It's a large book who has how many bitcoins. 
A bit like this
**Page 123 of the Blockchain**
* Bob has 3 Bitcoin
* Alice has 2 Bitcoin
And so on. Miners make the new blocks (pages) of the blockchain and get paid a few BTC for doing this. Mining takes electricity. They are all working together to make the next block. When someone makes a wrong block, he is ignored by the rest because can all see he is wrong.

20Mbit/s is quite common in Europe and is considered a "slow" upload. Even my 85 y.o. granny has 180Mbit down 50Mbit up cable. My city has unlimited 200Mbit/200Mbit or even more fiber for $80.
Just because the US internet infra is behind the rest of the world, should not limit Bitcoin. US hosts will have to be hosted in places with proper internet.


That's only when the 20MB block fills up to the brim. It won't for years to come. I'd say it will take (if we grow at a steady pace) years for the blocks to consistently be above 10MB. Occasional 20MB blocks could occur though. It will be more like 5 to 15GB a day max at current user adoption. Even so, 1.8TB per month is nothing, really. 
My Netflix (at 1080/4k) consumes about the same or more if you are an active movie watcher.

Ah ok. But each transaction - spam or not - is actually valid according to the blockchain so why would it be spam? The user is writing on the ledger, just as the protocol allows.
Do you think Bitcoin could scale without increasing the blocksize? Because that would be preferred I think. Any idea if Sidechains are going to work and/or if there is a Proof-of-concept planned?

No, it won't destroy anything. As long as the bad actor stays at 51% he can only delay transaction and mess around, he cannot break the past. He also has to stay at 51% - meaning keep control of **miners** that are not in his control.
Miners won't stay on a pool that starts pulling double spends. And a double spend is not really a "double"  spend, it's reverting transactions of blocks you mine yourself.
I'm so tired of the old 51% attack argument. It's not even feasible for longer periods (hours, days) of time.
@_date: 2014-12-30 12:25:54
PP and CC can reverse transactions after days, weeks and sometimes even months. Think of stolen CC's, scammers, etc.
BItcoin is digital "push" cash. Takes 10 seconds to check for a valid transaction (in the memory pool) and minutes to verify (first block) and 6 confirms to make it absolutely irreversible.
As a merchant, I would advise;
* Up to $400 worth - You are fine to take 0-confirm
* Up to $1000 worth - I'd wait at least 1 confirm before sending out the items by mail.
* Up to $5000 worth - I'd wait 2 confirms. And use mempool monitoring. (wish I had so much bitcoin though... ;))
* Up to $100,000 - wait for the 3 confirms.
* Above $100k - wait the full 6 confirms. Or use an escrow! 
You see - with enough money, like a few $1000 - it's actually possible to *try* a double spent. 
It's not black/white.

Amazon has a very high SLA and very high standards. A Bitcoin node does not need much. 99.9% uptime is enough, and you pay a lot of Amazon's and the top-notch datacenter.
From the booklet:


What I'm saying is that Amazon AWS is overkill. A cheap VPS host is more then enough and cuts the price in half at least.
I think it is much better for the network to run a node from home, and capping it to (for example) 5mbit max up&amp;down. Correct me if I'm wrong.

The key factor is that joining the network as a node is "open" to anyone. This would not work on a consensus network without mining as a Proof-of-work because one could spawn a majority of nodes and double-spent *and* revert the public ledger.
On a closed (private) LAN this works fine, however, because there is no incentive for your own nodes to go rogue.
The blockchain (with proof of work as described in the white paper) solves this issue for an open, public, ledger.

Bus, yes. Train: No. Trains are very fast &amp; efficient. Our roads are clogged as-is, if everyone who rides our trains would take an Uber... Nightmare.


So in 3 years you spend $72k on Uber. That's $24k a year, so about $2000 a month. 
You can get a new VW Golf for $300 a month with 40k mile limit per year, and the gas would be around $100 for a month if you drive around 3000 miles per month... so that's $400 a month all-in. And you get a free automatic wash-pass from the dealership so you wash it each month. Free insurance, free maintenance, free assist. Winter tyres included. 
You could also take a $125 VW "Up". It's not really comforting, has no AC, but that would lower your monthly cost to around $250 (it's very efficient, 58MPG).

Blockchain itself is *pretty* secure, but the security fails a lot because the OS of users is compromised (Password sniffing virusses) or they are lured into a fake blockchain site (icantbelieveitsnotblockchain.info).
If you have small amounts on there, and if you have reasonable security (don't open random exe stuff, and run a proper Antivirus) you are pretty safe. I would however advise you to consider researching alternatives like Electrum wallet on a seperate device. Or invest in a Trezor if you hold more than... like $1000 of Bitcoin.

Crack what? What's the vector?
Some possible "cracks" (not really).
* Reverse your address to pubkey. Hash algo's to be cracked: SHA-256,RIPE-MD. What can they do? Nothing.
* Reverse your pubkey to privkey. Hash algo to be cracked: ECDSA. What can they do? Spend your coins only if they have the pubkey (see 1). Normal user unaffected.
* Create a SHA-256 superminer. Hash algo's to be cracked: SHA-256. What can they do? Mine blocks very fast. The diff. of the network will adjust. Network unaffected.
Ok, they could backdoor your Apple-Mac/Windows/Android device and sniff your privkey/wallet password - but what else is new.
Hardware wallets, combined with multi-platform multisig and you are good to go. The real paranoid can use a TI-86 calculator or any other pre-NSA 32-bit ARM device and casino dice to make true offline privkeys.

I think you have never seen legacy systems at work. I've seen and maintained 90s AS400/Iseries systems run in hospitals, labs, casino's that still work. Hell - I've seen MSDOS based logistic systems still in use that were built in the early 80s!
They work, they do what they should do, and replacing them is a business risk that no contractor is going to take.
This is a funny example on how a legacy system just keeps on running and replacing is expensive:
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:28:09

Feature request:
I want to be able to sent a "vanity/short" address that is already known in the blockchain.

* Server looks up address in blockchain (wildcard) and API asks confirm for entire address 1Introx989023490823490blah
* I say "OK"
The idea behind this is that a 10 character address "wildcard" is pretty secure because it's very hard to vanitygen it. The API confirm lets me check the entire address before the actual send.

I guess so. That's how colored coins work. Party X emit tokens, you can trade them P2P. Maybe they want to do 2-2 multisig or something I don't know the details


Some features:
* tradeable outside of old markets
* They still limit the supply/peg to the underlaying value
* publicly auditable
Edit: Maybe this project is just going to make them realise they are going to become partially obsolete...

This is only true if the blocks are near/over capacity so the "market" has to fight (pay more) to get the txn in. Right now that is not the case, but once the the limit is reached the fees will go up. This is a *bad* thing because it will cause users to move to some other system that had more reasonable fees. Bitcoin will lose one of its key selling points; "Low Fees".
The max block size is only a "cap" to where a single block can grow, it's not good if the mempool starts to pile up.
I'd even go so far as to say:
More adoption, Larger blocks, More commulative fee, more profit for miners.
Paging what do you think?

Well the bandwith won't go 20-fold for at least 5 years. But 1MB is not enough short-term.
Maybe we should increase 1MB at a time. I think in about 5 years 5MB would be okay.
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:45:03
Well, zero-day malware can still steal your wallet. I would be very careful. Maybe download Virtualbox and run a seperate Win machine in there, or maybe your boss has an old laptop around? Slap Ubuntu on it, and use it as his dedicated Bitcoin machine. Electrum's seed will ensure you can always restore when the laptop goes up in flames or goes missing.
Better even, would be to use a Trezor device. That is secure-ish on a daily used Windows machine.
My 2 cents. I would always give the best of the best advice to your boss, and let him decide if he wants to skim on security.

At this moment you can. When the blocksize reaches 1MB for days and days on end, that's when the miners will realise it's time to let go.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:11:08
Looks pretty avg. 144 so stable to me: 
How would that increase when the blocksize is raised? The network diff. adjusts up/down according to hashrate/blocksolve time. Not related to the # of transactions of volume.

The application is there. Just bitcoins as a worldwide P2P transfer of value. 
Sadly 
* The integrations/apps are bad (for Grandma, Plumber Joe), the UI is bad
* The marketing is **BAD**
* The market depth is 10% of the GPP of one of the poorest countries in the world (Congo), 
* The use-case (drug markets) is a terrible usage feature wise. Bitcoin is totally not anonymous (and that does not matter). How great is it that a sale of pot can be trace back to you literally 100 years in the future. How anonymous is that.
Beyond that, on a positive note;
* The network is rock solid by definition of the protocol.
* The protocol (on a technical level) is secure and fast.
* The network can scale beyond current and extrapolated use for years.
* Sidechains are awesome - if they would exist.

Let me guess - you are using Bitcoin-QT? This is normal. behind the scenes it sends the remainder of the balance to what is called a "change address". (You have 1.30, send 0.01 to X, the remaining 1.29).
The change address is not directly visible, but the wallet retains this just fine. it has to do with privacy, and re-using an old address is considered not "quantum proof" (theoretical..).
Is your balance (in your wallet) still correct?

* 100 satoshi = 1 bit ("cents") 
* 1000 bit = 1 mbit ("dollars")
* 1000 mbit = 1 BTC or full bitcoin ("grands").
That's not so hard. We should just never price stuff in "BTC" anymore, it's very illogical.
People need to have a simple way to compare the balance in their wallet to the price mentioned, that's all.
For example:
* 0.001 BTC for a coffee vs a 2.2 BTC balance in your wallet? That's just unreadable (for the average joe).
* 1mBTC for a coffee vs a 2200 mBTC balance, that's fine.

First of all. Amateurs. Really. No other way to say this. 
Second of all. Almost anyone should be able to imagine that a CPU at 100% burns away more BTU and KW/h then an idle one. Even worse, Dell has OpenManage and HP has "HP Insight Control power management" that will let you know you are using a lot more power.
Last: a simple calculation.
* 3000 servers, with a Xeon would give about 10Mhash/s MAX per server.
* So 30,000 Mhash/s - That's only 0.0273 BTC per month or $17.31 of "profit".
* I've tested this with a Dell R610 - A maxed out CPU is about 150 watt/h extra instead of 10% load
* That's 3000 * 150 watt/h = 450000 watt/h or about 450 Kw/h. 
* So they are burning 450 * 18 cents = $81 of power each hour.
Really dumb.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:40:37
Yes. no time limit. Most wallet generate up to 100 keys ahead, so each backup is valid 100 transactions in to the future. HD wallets can always be restored with the seed so no real need to back them up.
Some other wallets just use 1 address over and over, but this degrades anonimity a bit.

You cannot delete bitcoins. What can happen is that your wallet file gets deleted. You would not have the privatekeys any more, and so in a way the bitcoins become unmoveable.
Now, you would have backups (Cloud, DVD, USB, tapes, paper wallets, electrum seeds). So.
A mass-destruction event like some exchange loosing all coins (...) could indeed increase the price of the remaining bitcoins, unless there is a flaw in the protocol.

If your computer is part of The Internet™ its layer 3 network stack follows the rules (IP plan, DNS topology, etc) of the original Internet. Just like Bitcoin has different rules as Litecoin (genesis block different).
If you would create a VLAN on your NIC. You could access both "Internets" at once. You could even create a 0.0.0.0/0 broadcast LAN you could call "The Steuer2teuer-Net" with [MPLS](
Internet works the same way as Bitcoin: A set of rules that makes you hook into it.

The longest chain always wins. So even IF you mined a few blocks (impossible at 5Ghz) the rest of the network would be longer and outgrowing you once you come back to the real network - hence - it's leading.
You could change the bitcoin code to lower the diff - the rest of the network won't accept your blocks.
You cannot isolate a normal unpatched client and make it believe/fake the blocks. It would at least require a lot of computing power to do so.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:35:13
Coinbase? As far as I know, Coinbase does not give you the privkey so you don't actually *own* bitcoins stored on coinbase. Not really a problem, just something to be aware of.

@_date: 2015-05-25 15:25:32

* avg. blocksize
* min. blocksize (0)
* max blocksize (1MB or X?)
* what else?

Ok. This might seem a bit childish. 
**Bitcoin: The ELI12 edition.**
So Bitcoin is a network of computers. Running software that has certain rules. Rules like "This much" etc.
All Bitcoin computers have a big file of transactions. It's like a big book with millions of rows. Every 10 minutes there is a new row added to the big book. It has to start with a certain number, and this takes a lot of thinking by the computers to make.
This big book is the *blockchain*. The computers are *mining*.
So each 10 minutes there is a new *block*. It contains all transactions - like John paying Jill for a Pizza - of that 10 minutes.
All the *miners* are like really boring office workers, checking if the first to solve the puzzle is actually legit.
If anyone tries to raise his finger and call out a false puzzle, they are ignored. This process secures the *blockchain* from double spending coins you do not have or you already used. 
Once a miner solves a *block* they get 25 bitcoins - out of thin air * for being such a nice lad and helping the network yet another 10 minutes.
If too much computers join the numbers get bigger and bigger - this is to limit the amount of coins according to the *rules* of the protocol.
Why is it worth something? Because it's an open, honest system of tokens that cannot be faked. Once you hold bitcoins, you know how the rules are.


@_date: 2014-06-21 08:03:35
THe market is waiting for the auction to go through. Traders have moved some BTC into USD to be able to react to a sharp downtrend (in case the sale is below market value - and the buyer will have massive arbitrage opp.).
Once the first blocks are sold and the price is known, the price will fluctuate rapidly in the direction of the price. Whoever knows the price first will have a massive advantage.
This is in a way a dark transaction, but those will and can still influence the market. Even more because of the big volume.

No it's not, that was a tech demo and not a real hack. It needed physical access to the Trezor and some klunky soldering to it. It only worked when;
* There was physical access to the Trezor at initialisation.
* The user did not have a PIN set.
* The user did not use a dice(ware) for generation.
If you have physical access to any device the security will be weakened. Also it's about the same as tapping a wire into your keyboard imho.

No, actually the miners are securing the blockchain - hence protecting the Bitcoin ecosystem. That's not "wasted". Also they merge mine blockchains like Namecoin (A DNS system).


See above, it's not waste.


The mining-market adjusts, and maybe less people mine. Does not matter the diff. would go down in a few days


Because PoS is broken and even more unfair (large stakeholders get more, and more, etc).


repeat of question. it's already usefull (the blocksolve secures the Bitcoin blockchain and Namecoin blockchain). I think the security of Bitcoin is pretty important so usefull.

Good, because Bitcoin relies on ECSDA+SHA256 for wallet security, so we are good.


Not under their direct control, they are a pool. If they go rogue all the miners leave (I would at least) and they are expelled from the community.
You need 51%, and keep above 51% the whole time to delay the entire network. You can bet a lot of people would notice this and the alert key (Gavin, etc) would be raised. Any pool that would participate in the 51% (Essentially putting the network on pause) would hurt itself because a miner will not risk the network being harmed this way. 
51% is like going in an office with a large megaphone and shouting the entire time. Won't last long.

Agree, but it's still a very easy attack vector for any altcoin/govt/whatever to use. Bitcoin is a resource war, imho. 


Partially true. The UTXO needs to be in RAM when syncing - see [here]( but after that it could reside in a cache on a spinning or SSD disk. Still if it would outgrow normal memory specs (for example if it would go above 16GB **right now**) it would cause almost all nodes to exhaust RAM (and enter swapping hell).


Yep. THIS. Some say it's kicking the can along the road - but what's wrong with that. When needed just enlarge, and let stuff like Lightning mature.

You make 10-of-20 keys, give 5 to your friends and a few to some govt. / controlling agency. If they steal your 10 keys, you can invalidate it by combinding all the remaining keys.

@_date: 2015-05-08 12:39:31
I'm not so sure, mining on a GPU is just as bad. No way you are even making a few cents. I mean - you risk getting caught, jailed for a few satoshis?
If you run a good GPU at 100% it does around 300Mhash/s - So if you infect 100 machines you get 30,000 Mhash/s. If they run 24/7 (they don't) that about $2.45 per **month**
That's the worst crime ever. Most computers don't have a suitable GPU, the user will notice, and they don't run 24/7.
Futhermore, the hacker risks getting doxxed because the mined bitcoins can be tagged/traced back to him, the more he infects. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:41:43

@_date: 2015-05-25 14:09:16
Yes. A average mid-range AMD GPU does around 300Megahash/second. So that would give you about $0.02 worth per month, while burning away at least $27 worth of electricity.

A wallet is a piece of software. Bitcoin exist only on "The blockchain" this is a huge book of numbers that every "miner" on the network has with little "slots" called addresses.
Everyone has the exact same book, so everyone will agree on the content.
Each address has a key, and holds a certain amount of Bitcoin. Only the holder of the key (you) can move the bitcoins out of that address to, for example, a merchant's wallet.
Your wallet is a "wallet" filled with keys. It keeps track of the keys and the amount of Bitcoin each key holds. I personally would have preferred that a wallet would have been called a "keychain" because that is actually what it is.
That's the non-technical version.

Legal tender is more like... "if you have a debt to settle, in a legal framework, the law is okay with you paying by using $100 wire transfer to settle a $100 debt".

Uhm, no. The attack would be DDOS. So filling the blocks to the brim themself and making transaction pile up in the mempool. That's not happening now (while it's pretty easy if you have money) but will be a lot harder if the blocksize is bigger.


Yes. If the connection you want to DDOS (some ISDN modem..) is small, it's way more easy to DDOS than a 1GB fat pipe.
To DDOS Bitcoin all the attacker needs to do is fill 1MB of txn and pay more fee than the avg. txn in mempool. This would stop most "real" txns from going through. Now if the block was 20MB or maybe even 100MB max, he would have to keep filling **each** block to make the network slow down.
Bigger blocks == better ddos protection.

**The old "0-confirm is unsafe" myth - Bitcoin transaction are almost instant. Bitpay takes 0confirms just fine. It's actually pretty hard to pull of a successful (as it's called) double spent attack against a properly (fee included) transaction.**


**Any proof on this statement? The blockchain is pretty efficient, but can always be pruned, etc. Source: 


**Giving your coins away (1-of-1 private key) is a silly idea, if you ask me, except maybe on a trustworthy exchange.**
**Multisig deals with security pretty well and even a hacked phone. For instance Greenaddress.it has a very solid 2-of-3 security model with 2FA - without the need to give them complete control of your bitcoins (you still own them, they just co-sign).**
**Also: The hardware walled called Trezor is quite foolproof; Easy restore backup seed, impossible to infect, has an extra pin.**
**I would not go as far as to say it's ready for the general public, but Bitcoin security has come a long way to become less complex and more mainstream.**


**For tipping Bitcoin is still too expensive (below $1 levels at the moment) I agree. I would say use altcoins or off-chain tipping for that. Above $5 the fees get below 0.25%. That's pretty low if you ask me....**


**The mining ecosystem balances itself out (mining power, difficulty and fees) - If Bitcoin survives and becomes "big" miners can live off the fees alone. If they can't they just stop mining and the network adjusts. It's the free market at work.**


**51% requires 51% of mining power (owning) - Ghash.IO for example does not *own* the power, the mining do. If they pull a 51% attack, all the miners will leave them (and go to another pool).**
**51% is not all that powerfull. What exactly would one acchive besides putting the blockchain "on halt"? Spending other people's coins is impossible, and so is reversing transactions before the point your got 51%.**


**Fair enough. This is also a concern of mine. Automated escrow services run by Visa/etc. might solve this.**


**We are 5 years in. it is still an experiment, but fair point. It has to (and will) be tested a lot more.**

I just wish Vitalik was not going rogue on Bitcoin. It feels rushed to force an altcoin into the world now that Bitcoin is gaining traction. Ethereum is a great concept, but I just wish Bitcoin was the "fuel" as to bitcoin is the "gold" (pegged to ethers) and not the other way around.

ELI7-ish: It's Magic internet money, a digital coin that cannot be copied (unlike a picture of a cat). It can be send over the internet to anyone with a Bitcoin wallet. This can run on a phone, PC or even on a special machine called a hardware wallet. Bitcoin is secure because of mining - this is done by special machines that are very good at Bitcoin securing and are made for this. They are called ASICS. They keep the entire book of bitcoins called "The Blockchain".
These machines also create the bitcoins, at the speed of 25 per hour. This decreases each few years, and all the people using the machines have to devide the created coins. There  will only be 21 million bitcoins in the next 30 to 40 years.
You buy them at Circle.com or Kraken.com.

To DDOS Bitcoin all the attacker needs to do is fill 1MB of txn and pay more fee than the avg. txn in mempool. This would stop most "real" txns from going through. Now if the block was 20MB or maybe even 100MB max, he would have to keep filling each block to make the network slow down.
Bigger blocks == better ddos protection.

* Cellphones - I had one in 1996 and it only had reception near special zones  ...People thought it was stupid *"There's a Payphone right there, why do you need this?"* or *Who wants to have people calling you everywhere?*
* Smartphones in the 00s - I had a Palm PDA and later a HP iPAQ with GSM modem. I used to chat on IRC and use email while traveling. People would say it was "for nerds" and "a gimmick/gadget".
* Navigation in 2001: I had a TomTom GPS unit and people would say it was stupid, and *why would you want to pay 400 Gulden for that if you can use a 10$ map*
* "Drones" - I fly planes/copters since I was 13 in the 90s. I built a frame with 4 motors and a self made gyro stabiliser back in 2002 - now these things are called "drones" instead of what they are; RC planes and everyone is circle jerking about them.
* "Social Media" - back in 90s/00s all the "cool kids" did Usenet, IRC, Jabber, MSN. Now it's re-marketed as "Social Media" and worth 927839058092 Billion? Sure.

Yes but however I think - spam or not - that we should not differentiate between the *reason* for a transaction. If it is a gambler gambling his money away, or what may be the case. As long as he pays proper fee it's a valid transaction, right? Bitcoin should be engineered to not be vulnerable against any type of "spam" that disguises  itself as a normal transaction.

Dutch here. Going there in a few days, it's a small holiday so i've got some spare time.
But the Dutch Average Joe is not really grabbing Bitcoin with 2 hands - a lot of fear and FUD in media. Although our ex-Secretary of Treasury (J.P. de Jager) admitted he owns Bitcoin, and sees some future in it, although a few problems with volatility, so. 
And there was an Bitcoin event in Amsterdam **sponsored by ABN (Bank)**. Speakers from ING were there, and also ECB (The European FED) and Mike Hearn.
Among whom attending (speakers):
* Prof.dr. P. (Paul) Iske - Chief Dialogue Officer, ABN AMRO (
* Peter Verhaar - founder of Alex bank *(a large broker)*
* Mike Hearn
* Kim Gunnink - Policy for innovation &amp; Security ECB *(kind of like the Dutch FED)*
... Just saying. This is a larger "buy" flag then all this moon crap. They were not all 100% positive about all this - but mostly the mood was "interested".  Imagine how that would look for a US citizen: Kind of like Goldman, Citi and a spokesmen of Yellen attended a Bitcoin event

The miners don't decide though, the market does. If all exchanges accept the new fork, the market has spoken and you'd need to find another source of liquidity to trade the (now turned into an altcoin) old-bitcoins. 
Even if 40% of the miners switch (and a block larger than 1MB is mined) - if the exchanges trade on that fork the miners are out of luck, because the coins mined on the 1MB chain are not to be sold anymore.

@_date: 2014-12-29 12:26:52
What if. Yes indeed, what if there is a black-swan even where there is a massive, easy and destructive worm that exploits a yet-unknown bug in the software.
It cannot fake blocks, or insta-mine, or double spent. What it could do though is disrupt and/or destroy the node (f/a delete the blockchain).
I've thought of this. I run several nodes, but always on a VM infrastructure. I take daily differential block-level snapshots of the ISCSI volumes, and full weekly. The weekly ones go back 2 months.
In the even of a disaster on the network, 
* Roll back the nodes to a working version.
* Keep them offline.
* Patch the bug/do a workaround.
* Bring back online.
So at least a number nodes will survive this.

Yes, but you can move the bitcoins away from the "XCP Address" after this. The colored coins will still be there. You can re-use the same coins over and over again. Like 0.0001BTC

1MB is 3 to 7 TPS depending on using multisig/inputsizes/etc. So a 20MB block would be around 100TPS-ish.
This is more than enough™ for the coming years, even 1MB is enough for now. Years from now we really need to scale Bitcoin constructively: sidechains need to be developed (if possible at all), the blockchain needs to be pruned for fully spent outputs, and maybe the database needs to become based on sort of decentralised model (maybe something like glusterfs.org).
Stuff like the Lightning model is years for being released, but here we are - with a randomly chosen 1MB block limit. It just needs to be tweaked up a bit.

After a lot of troll-fighting user came up with a proper argument: The UTXO database. ELI5: The UTXO database is a a big list of all the addresses that hold a bitcoin balance. This has to be (a large part) in memory in order to get a computer synced with the blockchain. If the blocksize is increased, it will be more easy to make this UTXO database grow *fast*. This means that even a enterprise grade server will start to have problems with syncing if the UTXO grows to 16 or even 32GB or more. Gavin has a post on this [here]( and here are [the statistics on the UTXO](

There's no need to have the blockchain synced to extract the balance. Warning: Always keep a backup of wallet.dat before every step you do. This is advanced bitcoin stuff and because Bitcoin Core uses change addresses, your bitcoins might not actually be on the address you think they are. Make sure your system is clean of viruses that might snatch the privkey when it is displayed or copied.
* check on blockchain.info if the X address holds the correct balance
* click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
* click on 'debug window'
* select the 'console' tab
* type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
* type: dumpprivkey [your public X address here]
* this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards
* type: walletlock
You can now import the privkey into, for example, electrum wallet or swipe the balance with our phone.

It wouldn't be a revolution, but rather evolution. Slowly a new p2p system
might take over. The current monetary systems were mainly backed with gold
(not anymore now, to my knowledge). Maybe the underlying values of a virtual
peer to peer system could be other scarce resources, relatively easy to
exchange via internet. Examples are: computer processing power, bandwith and
data storage. These resources would make a limited peer to peer money
exchange system possible. Limited to the total real life value of all these
resources. However from that point other resources could back up the virtual

**A Quick introduction to Bitcoin for the tech-savvy, but new-to-Bitcoin audience**
    Ever since the dawn of the Internet we have seen huge paradigm shifts in the way we communicate, do business,        
    meet, learn, and interact. One thing, however, has remained rather traditional: The way we define, visualise,     
    create and transact money. It's still a web of trusted parties, banks, processors, institutions, cash and Govts.
    Meet Bitcoin - the network. 
    Bitcoin is not a Coin. It's programmable money defined by a technical protocol with a set of rules. Bitcoin 
    tries to solve, among other things, something called "The Double Spending Problem" A digital token that 
    can only be spent from person A to B, once. In a broad sense; Bitcoin is more like a digital asset than a  
    payment system. More specific - it's a protocol that defines bitcoins - like email protocols define an 
    electronic postal office.
    Bitcoin is still Beta and highly experimental. The problem it solves is not something we very much need now - 
    the internet of things (a term often used in marketing) is still not deeply embedded in our lives, but one day
    we will need a  more decentralised, international, standardised way to distribute, secure and send money 
    like Bitcoin is experimenting with.
    The Bitcoin network has a set of rules - the 2 key rules are: The amount of bitcoin ever created, and the way 
    the network stores to transactions and links them (the Blockchain). These rules, and also the 
    transactions, are secured by people called "miners" running specially designed hardware called 
    "Bitcoin miners". These machines take votes on every page of the Blockchain and help maintain its 
    integrity and security. For doing so, they are rewarded bitcoins by the users of the network and the 
    network itself.
    A condensed summary of some of the key features are;
    * Operated without friction on a world wide scale - there are no borders of control.
    * Cheap to use, open to anyone (Bitcoin does not discriminate or deny service).
    * Bitcoins are instantly send, and transactions take up to about 1 hour to become absolutely irreversible.
    * Fair distribution (It takes skill, energy and man-hours to be rewarded bitcoins by mining).
    * Technical features like: Multi-signature transactions, Timelocks, Sidechains, etc.

* ~~What is the stock:bitcoins ration?~~ 1:200 in SEK
I tried searching for it on my EU trading platform (the ISIN is SE0007126024) but I could not find it (yet).
**Edit:** ok so it's a 1:1 tracker, with a 0.005 leverage. So 200 "stocks" == 1 BTC. 
Current price of tracker is = 9.68 SEK * 200 = 1936 SEK per BTC = $235

Hey welcome. If you want a proper secure paper wallet you need to use a LiveCD with bitaddress. It's also possible to use a LiveCD with Electrum - generate the seed - write it down.
That electrum seed is now your cold-storage but with the option to restore when needed and transact with.

Once Bitcoin makes a significant move, a lot of BTC lenders will pull back /out. That might cause shorters to fail to keep the price down and hitting limits, knocking out more and more short positions on the way up.

Idea: Put a RFID chip in there as well. This adds another layer of security, because the owner would know the serial# of the chip, but someone who's trying to make a knock-off by using pictures would not, so even a perfect copy won't work.
Also, don't glue. Epoxy can be removed with chemicals and re-sealed without a mark. Maybe it's better to spot-weld through the 2 rings? You would have to drill out the spotweld to seperate the 2 rings.

I read that, and it does *not* give any clear reasons why it would break/not work. He goes on about vapourware like Lightning etc - Still years away.
He also says


(both increases and non-increases). Most of them have subtle implications
and each are worth its own research paper or six, so it can be difficult
to only touch them slightly without creating a gish gallop that is hard
to respond to.
I'd like to know what those angles are. He literally gives none.
He also says (key argument I think)


scarcity of capacity. 
Fair enough, and true. But the capacity should be in balance between ask/demand. If the backlog starts building up when 1.5MB is demanded the network kinda loses its utility imho. Clearly we are near the 1MB limit.


It's not a minimum size, it's a maximum size. Miners can still exclude txns that don't have fees just like they do now. SOme other miner might choose to include them after all (and have a 20MB block after several 3MB blocks). I don't get how the incentive goes away - There's more possible fee per block!
He then goes about how mining will become centralised if the blockchain is too big - well  I think it will not change anything. Most miners don't run a node anyway and at 20MB/min it's only 1TB per year *max*. Is that so hard? Do we want Bitcoin to succeed or to wither away?

Shorting/options is healthy for a market. 


Bitpay processes 1000s of USD per day, and they don't allow illegal stuff.

Yes. Well at current speed (1% of the network) it would take a day before it's included in a block, and than 6 blocks later (an hour) it's 100% safe.
Unless an other miner decides to include a fee-less transaction. Sometimes they do (i've tested this). Eligius is a pool that seems to include fee-less when there is space in the block.

Indeed. 51% of the miners control what we do. Hardforks that ban that address from ever moving *can* indeed happen. Interesting huh?
Funny though, if you change something, like for example X in Bitcoin, and 51% of the miners adopt it, it would fork the blockchain.
But funny enough, the OLD (49%) blockchain will also keep existing. If people keep mining on that, albeit very slowfly, it will keep growing.
So it would fork Bitcoin into Bitcoin-Original and Bitcoin-with-X. You have to decide what Bitcoin network you client connects to. Your client will either "listen" to Bitcoin-Original or to Bitcoin-with-X, depening if it thinks the block at the fork is valid.

Do a quick search in the entire filesystem to see if Windows it has moved the %appdata% Bitcoin folder somewhere. Look for wallet.dat - it should have an old "creation" date.
If you cannot find it, shutdown the system and connect the drive to another computer and use GetDataBack to un-delete the wallet.dat - the chances of succeeding in this is are about 25% imho.

Rackspace is fine, but not for a hotwallet of a multi-million dollar exchange (imho). I would say private Tier-4 or gtfo.
I'd say, as a hotwallet, keep multiples "stages" of hot vs cold. Keep the signing offline. Use one-direction fiber to the signing machine. Use some kind of human interaction for any a) size of b) volume per day transaction.

Don't take offence to some of the reactions on your question below. Some are a bit unfriendly.
Bitcoins cannot be stored on a USB stick, but you can backup your *private keys* that are - in a way - your bitcoins. Either backup the wallet file, or you can generate a "paper wallet" (a JPEG image with the privatekey (never show anyoe) and the public key/address ("bank number"))
Now, this is not the best thing to do. USB sticks don't live forever and can be destroyed pretty simple. 
I don't know how big of a stash we are talking here, but if it's big (like above $1000) you might want to consider buying a Ledger or Trezor wallet. It's a special piece of USB hardware that stores your private keys. It's very secure, but they cost $30 to $90.
Stay safe.

Mmm no I did not say that.

Are you talking about the addresses? ECDSA?
Bitcoin has 2^160 private keys (RipeMD-160).
So even if each address was storable as 1 bit, it would be 2^160 bit, or 1.827×10^35 TB  (terabytes)
That's a lot of storage.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:59:06
Nice work!
Suggestions: 
* Give a green "V" feedback if the address validates checksum (to prevent typo etc). 
* Make the field able to access HTML5 webcam access for QR code scanning... :)

It was April 2011. Got into mining. Summer came, got really hot. I had 1 GPU mining 0.3 BTC every day during the last months I mined. 
Bitcoin crashed. I got fed up with it, GF complaing about the heat/smell the miner emitted. Sold it all to fill up the gastank and pay for my vacation (35 BTC or so. €5 to €10 a piece or so.). Sold the GPU for Euros.

Quantum can reverse a pubkey-&gt;privkey in theory, that is why Satoshi was smart/lucky to implement some extra RIPE-MD hashing so the actual addres *is not* the pubkey and is only used *upon signing a transaction*.
As long as you don't re-use addresses (looking at you, blockchain.info) you're pretty safe because your bitcoins's private *and* public key are unknown to the Quantum hacker.

At this moment in time it's not possible (imho). Once quantum computers come along, every signed transactiond *and* public keys makes deriving the private key *somewhat* more possible.
Best to not use Bitcoin suboptimal. I'd say don't re-use addresses just in case.

Frozen music: *Do you want to make some Shitcoins....*
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:54:35


Agree. But for every signed transacting *and* pubkey a truly NP quantumcomputer could (in theory) speed up the privkey derivation.
Satoshi prob. knew this, that's why the pubkey is unknown up to the point one signs the transacitons (RIPEMD-160 + SHA256 hashed).

bitcoind is a single point of failure. If any software error emerges, and the network is decentralised by having multiple implementations of the same protocol running, it's stronger.


If bitcoinj or btcd would be 40% of the network fail, why would that induce systemic risk? The rest of the network survives and adapts, and Bitcoin lives on.

That would pump money into the ecosystem because you are buying (giving money to the miners, traders) slowly, then suddenly dumping (you get back less USD).
Result: 
* Commulative USD balance of traders combined is now higher.
* Bitcoin is more spread out among new traders each time you dump ("cheap coins")
That's a catalyst, not a killer. If you do what you prepose you are essentially *preventing* it from bubbling too hard.....

1BTC is the default bitcoin unit. 
* 1BTC = 1000mBTC (millibits)
* 1mBTC = 1000uBTC (microbit or "bits").

@_date: 2015-01-09 19:06:04
* Let's take an Intel i7 CPU. It does around 270 KKeys/s - so 270,000 keys per second. That's 23328000000 keys per day.
* There are around 1.5B computers in the world. They don't all have i7 but let's take that number anyway... 
* That's 23328000000 x 1.5B = 3,4992E19 keys each day. 
* There are 2^160 keys - so 1,4615016373309E48
This means, that running all computers for a 24 hour day, generating ECSDA keys would give you a whopping
**0.0000000000000000000000000000239425% of all bitcoin addresses!**
For this example we are going to omit the fact you need the IO to *check* each generated address against the blockchain (this takes even more IO), the power required (over 8 times anual world consumption or something), more storage than the world can handle a lot of times over and a lot of manhours.
It's looking pretty bleak.

Bitcoin is an experiment, first of its kind. It's a form of digital cash without a single person or entity giving them out. They are made by miners, people who run special hardware that secures everyone's bitcoins, at a fixed rate and supply.

I can't know what you did or what you gambled away. All I know is that you have to *stop* gambling. Take all this as a lesson and don't do it again. You have to failed, because gambling is engineered to make you **fail** in the long term. There is no way to win, the longer you play, the more you start failing.
Take some distance from all this, you seem really way to deep into this. Go read a book, take a long walk and re-think your life. Maybe seek prof help.


You could start by doing half an hour runs, with someone who can help you. Or maybe goto a local gym and ask them for help. I'm sorry life seems bad for you, but are you healthy?

Yes. The 2011 crash was $36 to $3. And $3 to $0.10. The 2013 crash was $266 to $50. The late 2013 to 2015Q1 crash was ~$1100 to $153-ish
The lower it goes, the more the "whales" buy. The amount of coins is limited so it reaches equilibrium.
Double digits might happen, single digits - Imho - Not. 
Let's state it this way; I'm a tiny player. I own very little BTC. I have a small short position to hedge against loss. If Bitcoin would go to $10 that position would be so large I could buy hundreds of bitcoins because of the 20x leverage.
The only reason I would not do this would be if Bitcoin (the network) is destroyed.

They'd have to be able to outrun the transaction, and double-spend the bitcoins while bribing a large mining pool.
With enough a) hashing power and b) very fast quantum reverse lookup/pigeonhole attacking (before a block is mined) that could indeed work.
It is however in the realms of fiction at this point in time. Once quantum starts cracking ECSDA in the wild with little effort I'd start to worry.
Quantum computing still operates in the realm of our universe's laws and dynamics. Read here what they can and can't do

That's done already. Miners decide what they do and don't include in a block.
But miners are not 1 person or 1 entity. So some will include 99.9%, but the other miner will include the remaining 0.1%.
Try sending a transaction for $1 without fee. Most miners will say "Nope!" but sometimes there's a good guy that does mine it into a block.
Miners can choose what they include in the chain.

**Some snippets I found interesting**


**Seems fair.**


**Often this is quoted partially, but read carefully, they are *not* saying anything should be done here, they are quoting the EBA recommendations.**


**Look how they say "balance" instead of "ermagerd, BAN IT". It's not that negative.**


**Fair enough.**


Digital currencies may offer a number of potential benefits to legitimate users including reduced transaction costs, faster transaction speeds, financial inclusion, competition and innovation. However, as noted in the June 2014 EBA Opinion, pending EU regulations and directives are explicitly addressing some of the issues that the benefits of digital currencies may be able to address. Similarly, in the UK domestic market, Faster Payments offers many of the same benefits as digital currencies. Both are real-time, irrevocable, credit push and low cost, and in most cases Faster Payments are free to consumers. Faster Payments also conform to all AML and related regulations and operate under a supervised consumer protection regime. In cross-border payment scenarios, though, where many current competitors are not conventional financial institutions, digital currencies may indeed provide lower costs and other benefits to some customers.
**TLDR; Bitcoin might be to an advantage for Consumers.**




* Recorded transactions leaving a public audit trail, which could support financial crime control with effective international co-operation
* Fewer barriers to cross border trade. 
* Faster settlement time for payments. 
* Lower transmission charges, and lower charges for cross-border e-Commerce and money remittance. 
* Enhanced ability to carry out ‘micro-payments’, for example paying a nominal amount to access a news article online.
**Seems fair! Look how they seem to get "it" and are even giving Digital currencies credit where there's credit due.**


**ok.....go on?**


**So they might want to fork it? I find this a weird sentence**




**This is true, but is up to the "investor".**


**This is not super negative, they don't want to ban it.**


**Lies. Tor is terrible for anonymity when using Bitcoin**


**XBT is around the corner?**


**It might have effect, but they don't say this is bad/evil/etc.**


**TLDR; Cool story bro, but we want to prevent this from going in a bad direction. We'll try our best to stop terrorists, kk?**

Of course this is all B.S. - But the public, already conditionised that bitcoins are *evil* will eat this shit up. Yep.

Anyway. No Govt. is going to really attack Bitcoin. It's teeny-tiny super small, hardly a blip on the financial radar.

26 minutes happens. Just like 3 seconds. It's 10 minutes on average so this is possible.
Blocktimes are in no way able to check. It's up to the miner to put in a valid or correct time. It is however a fact how "fast" the network sees the block.
A miner could withhold a block, in theory. And release it 1 minute later, understand what I mean?

Nope. Bitcoin uses ECDSA. A Quantum computer could derive the Privkey from the Pubkey, but Bitcoin wallets do not publish the Pubkey up to the point that you sign a transaction (pubkey is RIPE-MD hashed, among others).
So as soon as quantum computers start crackin' ECSDA addresses - you are fine as long as you don;t re-use addresses. (like Bitcoin-QT, electrum, multibit don't do indeed).
What *could* happen though is that some RNG library/hardware is backdoored or broken, that *is* a legitimate concern.

It's hard to destroy. If they drive down the price too much or too many times (this takes time, money) other traders will also profit and accumulate more USD/Bitcoin
So doing these "market destroying" moves only causes *more* spreading of coins while *also* creating more whales. The difference between bitcoin-rich and bitcoin-poor becomes larger, while the number of bitcoin buyers increases (more media attention, etc).
Bitcoin can only be destroyed by destroying the infrastructure. Attack the full nodes, go after miner-farm operators, etc.

An avarage person can do online banking, and thus would be able to use a Trezor / HW Wallet. 


Some major banks in Europe have a very specific item in the ToS - One *must* run Antivirus and illegal software and malware that steals money from their account is *not* always covered
It's a myth that banks give you your money back no matter what. People get scammed in banking all the time and they don't pay you back if you are an idiot and gave out the PIN or if you don't run AV on a malware ridden PC and they do MITM.

PS Don't forget energy prices.

Anyway. Circle.com worked fine for me, but you gotta research cold storage and stuff like that if we are talking large amounts of bitcoins here. A normal, daily used, window machine is not secure.

I do. But I've also visted a lot of crappy ones.
Edit: I've been in a datacenter that hosted some co-located semi healthcare stuff. FUnny thing was they had a few routers to other (more secure) healthcare networks for healthcare data and some network guy had problems getting DHCP addresses "in the wrong range". What happend, someone forgot to save the switch' config so after a powerdown everything was VLAN 1 again. That way the 2 VLAN's (It also had a layer 2 dark fiber storage VLAN to the main office for backup stuff) was linked together and the public WIFI LAN was in the same VLAN as the ISCSI LAN of the co-partner of that health institution. So the clients inttermittendly got WIFI/ISCSI IP addresses. There was no password on the target luns so a skilled hacker could have done some pretty nasty things. From a public wifi....
Another story: A datacenter did not check your ID, they had an online system where you had to "book" a visit. Once arrived they checked if you booked an appointment. The clerk typed in your last name and found you on the list. You could enter. 
I arrived at the location, and when I said my name he said "But... you already checked in and out this morning". Someone with the same last name as me checked in on my name. Since then they also check the company name.
Another story; Some guy needed to service the sprinklers and smoke detectors in the building. They used a special "hood" on a stick they mount over the detector while in some sort of service mode, and it beeps. Done. My collegue was working in the serverroom (this was a medium sized insurance branch office with a failover-MER. So the smoke detector guy is not very smart, and when he sees the guy leave the room he prob. though to also quickly check the smoke detectors there. My collegue let him in because he thought he knew what he was doing. 
He was that close to putting the smoke-thing against the (seperate from the building's fire system because it was a 90s Halon system) IT detector. That could have ended badly.
Not all (cheap, budget) datacenters are that well protected.

Been thinking about it; functionally wise there needs to be a method of transacting TX/RX datastream to the Trezor (USB device). Best would be without any plugins or software, so using existing and proven "tech.
Why not make Trezor emulate an audio device and make it talk like a "modem" with the HTML5 wallet? (optionally). 
 
Or maybe like the Omnikey that the corporate banking industry uses?

Ok so $10Bil
* Well to get 51% of the mining hardware, you need to get at least 351Ph/s (Network now is 350Ph/s, to get 51% you need to **add** 351Ph/s = 350,000,000 Ghash/s). 
* An S4 Antminer is 2000 USD and does 2000Gh/s so you need to buy 175,000 Antminers, costing you  whopping **$350,000,000** (sans infrastructure, cooling, shipping, VAT).
* Then you need power. Lots of **power**. Around 1,000,000,000 kWh a year for 350Ph/s 
* If you take $0.10 per kWh - that's about $100,000,000 a year in power.  
**So you can put the network on hold for about 4 years, for 10 Billion. But you have to make sure to not drop below 51% or you are actually *helping* the network instead of *hurting*

There are not a lot of regulations for Bitcoin exchanges, other than KYC/AML etc. - most legit exchanges (Kraken, Bitstamp) do these, quite extensively (Passport scans, selfies, utility bills). Just like most non-Bitcoin trading sites do (Plus500, Markets.com, Binck trader and other online trading sites).
The fact that it's not *heavily* regulated, does not mean it's breaking the law, or lacking regulation.

Sure you can, the rest of the blockchain won't accept your blocks as valid, though.
You can do this RIGHT now, just change the code of core, and increase the amount of coins per block to 1000BTC and mine a block.
Good luck with your altcoin ;)

Once you re-use addresses, even cold wallets are affected (in theory). The Pubkey is shown. Also, a compromised computer generating address is broken anyway (virus, keyloggers, just stealing the private keys).
Against privkey leakage - there's a way to prevent this.

Oh for sure. With 2000 coins you can rape the entire orderbook (and cause a huge margin all on people that are long). 2000 more coins destroys any bullish sentiment.

If you do it on Amazon EC2 it's pretty easy. Make a template and boot 100s of instances.
You'd need about a $1 per hour instance for a good proper working node (storage and memory are expensive).
So 100 nodes would cost you about $100 per hour.

Does he not have a backup? USB sticks? no other evidence of buying bitcoins etc? 
Check his bank account from 2009-2010 - There should be a transfer to an exchange somewhere. If not; the chance that he does have bitcoins in there is less.
Does it look "ok" or does it look corrosive? Post pics.

@_date: 2015-01-28 22:21:37
Example why bitcoins are terrible for "illicit activity";
* You meet with a trader after making appointment over phone to buy something sinister like a Kanye album
* You pay him bitcoins. He gives you the item
* The cops bust his ass later on, because they saw him on camera
* They find his phone, your phonenumber (your identity) and the appointment - also the bitcoin transaction. 
* They now have a) your address (where the coins came from) and b) your identity
* They link it to other dealers they busted. You are in trouble.
You are now doxxed.

Bitcoin is fine. Blocks are being mined, it's transacting, there have been 0 technical failures.
Price momvement: Nothing is going to happen. This is like 2012 - go a bit up, a bit down, some sideways while bitcoin markets lick the wounds of the 2014 "crash". It's dead, long live Bitcoin. We are now at Oktober-2014 pricelevels ($230)
I think we might see $150 again (test) but this year might also see $400. 
The biggest strides will be: More hardware wallet developments, more large investors *looking* into Bitcoin (not buying, that would be silly) and blockchain apps like Factom.com and other Bitcoin 2.0 stuff.
Also, this year (my prediction is summer) Bitlicense will come out - that will be an important moment, either the USA is *out (impossible to comply)* or *in*.
If out: More sideways. If in: some uptrend.

The problem is not the hardfork, the problem is that it's a change to the economic parameters of Bitcoin. It's not a DB backend change, it's a change to the way blocks are created and stacked.
**This means both miners and users/services need to switch**
It actually changes the rules of conduct of Bitcoin and creates 2 chains. Bitcoin-vanilla and Bitcoin-BigBlock.
What services are going to switch? How is the balance of people switching going to be? If I send coins to service X will they only accept BigBlock? What coins is Bitstamp/OkCoin/etc. trading?

You only run it for a few days each time, raping the network while shorting on margin on all exchanges massively. 
* Turn on machines - mine only empty blocks (burning through $1000s of USD in power. Panic ensues.
* Go short 5000 contracts 20x to 50x short on all exchanges
* Price goes down 50$
* 5000x50$x20=$5000000
* Stop machines after a few days
* Repeat
The electricity costs don't matter in this case, it's a small amount because you only run for a few hours to days.

You want to change, well do it. Stop gambling. Here's what you'll do.
Take a break from Bitcoin, store any bitcoins you have left in a paper wallet and forget about it for a while. Clean your house/room, sell or trow away anything that you don't use, catch up with at least 1 friend this month and go and update your resume. That is my advise to you, let me know how it goes and I'll be glad to try to help. Also you need to find a job. **anything** - even if it's just 1 hour a week you need to have something to *do*.
You don't have an illness, you have some financial freedom not having the stress of a household, i'd say, life's outlook is pretty much an open book for you to write the rest.

A **constant** 20x increase in usage of Bitcoin? That's not going to happen for at least years from now....


...in the US. You can't host a Bitcoin node from rural Kansas on a consumer grade connections, indeed.
In the EU: A VPS with cheap ZFS storage and 1TB of traffic is around €5. That's 3x the powercost of a desktop server running in your garage (€0,20 per Kwh, 744 hours per month, 0.1Kw usage = ~€15 euros).

Zoom out Bitcoin graphs. I think we are at the spring 2012 "era". It's going to be a *while* before anything happens.
You see, there's a lot of "get rich quick" guys on board just like you. They need to sell and move on before the price can even go up. There's just too much profit taking all the time on $10 moves.

Bitcoin nodes don;t need that. a 99,9% uptime is good enough. old 7200k disks are good enough. Give it a good upload rate though (50mbit or more).

ECDSA is the signing algo, your brain cannot do that (it requires complex math). You'd have to make a signing algoritm that your brain can handle.
What you *could* do is hold a brainwallet and spent from it using Brainwallet. So you would at least need;
* A copy of the 
* your brain (and peripherals aka hands) 
* A connection to push the txid on. 
Remember, brainwallets are not very secure. There are people trying to guess simple ones like "hellothisisabrainwallet" all the time. The human mind does not have enough entropy to create a secure one.
A random sentence with some numbers and special characters trown in (at least 20 or more digits) is *somewhat* secure, but not advisable.

Yes, but it would "fork" (split) the network in two different blockchains. One would be "Bitcoin: The original" and the other would become "Bitcoin: faux 44m version".

Meh, sure. But adoption in countries that have no nodes seems kinda lame. Bitcoin nodes need to spread out like you said.
The network needs to strengthen. For example there are 300 nodes in a small country like Holland; seems a waste of power. 100 ok. but 300...?
If a country starts banning Bitcoin nodes (this can and *might* happen) the neighbouring country could still (maybe) give the users a close source for the blockchain. Every country or router/DI/firewall in between could disrupt the blockchain.
Think China - Bordered by Nepal, Russia, Mongolia. Or think about Africa - crappy internet infrastructure might cut off backbones to the north/south leaving no nearby nodes.
I run over 15 full nodes, mostly in 1st world countries. If this topic is no successfull I'll do it myself indeed.

This is like trying to ban *cars* - "All cars are banned!". What's a car? Does it have 4 wheels? So does a buggy. Does it drive on a road or a track? You have to define something in order to ban it.

**On CPU mining on a botnet**
CPU mining is really dead. even if you infect all PC's in the world, nog way.
* Tking an avarage CPU mining speed of 5 Mhash/s. 
* And having about 1 Billion PC"s in the entire world 
* That's 5,000,000,000 Mhash/s - That's 5,000,000 Ghash/s - that's only **5%** of all mining power currently in existence. 
Remember, you would have to infect all computers in the world for that. The Bitcoin network is really, really fast.
**About wallets:**
You should also read into 
BIP0032. It's a bit technical, but it's what Electrum wallet uses. It's a special sentence you "write down" that recover your wallet out of thin air, even if your laptop is destroyed in a fire. 
It's sorta like a magic sentence you write down, and never show to anyone. Maybe even put in somewhere safe. You could even store it only in your head. Don't drink too much though or you forget.......... ;) (kidding)

@_date: 2017-02-11 14:25:24
No, because it's an unsigned int. Values in bitcoin are 64-bit integers.
It's expressed in satoshi on the backend.
for example 1.01223344 BTC is written as "value": 101223344  &lt;&lt;&lt; 64 bit integer
That is why the "Satoshi" is currently the smallest unit of value that can be used in a transaction. aka 000000001 Bitcoin.

Yes. And no. Once coins are merged into one input they are "added" so you can't really say what part of the coins comes from A or B once spent to C. They are both input. But if the amountis never combined it is possible (coinbase&gt;25BTC&gt;address 1&gt;address2).

They don't have direct control over the mining but the markets/exchanges (or more correctly: the users of the exchanges) do determine the value of bitcoins. Miners need to make the right decisions in order to protect their own tokens-of-value: the bitcoins they mine and possibly sell on the same open market.
If they do something silly (like "attack" Bitcoin by mining only empty blocks, or changing the ECDSA so something less secure or even a crazy softfork for example) the price would be affected.

So? You keep money in both exchanges and it's arbitrage. 


Correct. But to put it in extremes: What's more easy to spam a 1KB block or 1MB block? The first. Just like 20MB is more hard to fill to the brim consistently than a 1MB block. 
It would cost about 5000$ to fill up 1MB blocks for a day (outbidding normal user fees). At least it would be 20x more hard to do at 20MB.

Well the moment things like this are happening, and word would get out, the price would crash, and the miners themselves would get hurt, and the pool acting like this would loose mining power.
Have to remember, miners are not always nodes. Ghash is still a lot of different people just pointing hashrate to a cluster of Nodes.
What you don't seem to understand is that (for example) Elgius or P2Pool would eventually mine your TXid, and the other mining pools won't be able to keep up and the blockheight would keep on rising? How would the "others" reverse that?
That would be Ye' old 51% attack.

A "IPV4-&gt;IPV6 landscape" kind of change (although Bitcoin already supports IPV6 though) would be a hardfork. Those are kinda hard. Softforks, changes that are accepted but still unsupported by older nodes/miners, are rather easy and don't split up the chain.

But they seem to cover the volatility by hedging (shorting/long). So if Bitcoin falls to $1 it's rather easy for them to cover this - just buy them off an exchange.

Possible attack vector; You need to get physical access to the server to install a keylogger. So you can sniff out the password , do a remote login, and look at the sourcecode (and change, for example, the RNG to make specific privkeys instead of random ones. 
So not like "98798720394875098743" but more like "3333332223333333233333"
How? 
**A short crappy IT security story - Written by me, just now**
You find out who's working for the company  - you try to find out their names. "Hello? Yes this is Mr. Bruwkowsky, I'm calling for Steve..or Steven? The lead network admin?". *"I'm sorry, nobody here with that name, do you mean Jack?"* - "Bingo!" - You think, after excusing yourself and hanging up.
You rake LinkedIN, his name, and you social engineer where the datacenter is. You hire rackspace and try to find where Bitstamp is hosting their servers on the datacenter floor. You keep coming back *for maintenance to your server* until you find the rack. Dang, it's locked!
You go downstairs, and you tell the floorguy that the key broke off in the lock to the Suite 15B - Where your victims server is. You chat the guy up while walking back to the Suite while carrying a shitload of heavy tools. He opens the door for you.....*"sucker"* -...you quickly think while smiling.
The computer closets are all Ritall *"Just what I hoped"* you think, while fiddling through your backpack you pull out the masterkey for late-2011 model Ritall closets you bought on Darkmarket. You try a few and - click - the door swings open. "Finally".
You plug in the USB keylogger. And pull the plug on the server and plug it back in. *"Now just wait for the guys to come by and type in the password for the encrypted filesystem and I'm in"* - you think, while quickly locking everything up again.
Once you have physical access, security is dead.
**The end**
This is all fictional because I'm bored at the trainstation, but this is how infrastructures get hacked. People are sloppy with security, KVM, leave doors open, allow USB sticks to be plugged into corporate computers, click fishy exe links in email, open rogue PDF attachments, etc.....

Because if the blockchain splits, there will be 2 valid "bitcoins" on each side. Purists will keep using the old fork. This could cause uncertainty in markets - markets don't like uncertainty = price crash.
Hardforks have been done, but the ecosystem was way way simpler. It's best to avoid having to do one. (if possible). I'm neutral on blocksize increase, I think if the survival of Bitcoin would depend on it, eventually, it will be done.

A key feature for me would be: Transaction health monitoring. There's a lot of discussion about "ermagerd Bitcoin isn't instant" etc - I think that proper mempool/tx analysis built into the appliance would be awesome.
Bitpay takes 0-confirms and I'm pretty sure they do it. 
Monitor 
 
* mempool distribution
* proper fees
* txn size vs fee

They're not *against*.
It's just that if you start to mine blocks beyond 1MB the network "splits" and there will be a mess if there's no good oncensus. You would have coins on both blockchains, and... which one is valid &amp; tradeable at that point? Well both are. Purists and some exchanges will stay on the old chain, while some would move to new.
This is an event best avoided, but possibly needed.

What's the advantage?
Let's take some of Bitcoin's features - with 100%-bank-coin:
* P2P: Not really, because the bank controls it
* Decentralised: No, because the bank is 100% in control
* Open to anyone: No, because banks need to follow AML/KYC so it can block users when they want.

The Bitcoin blockchain infrastructure has intrinsic value in its utility, you can use it as a time-stamping device, as a proof-of-existence hashing and signing system, and of course the most used feature: sending arbitrarily tokens across the planet instantly verifiable (with a ~1 hour waiting time for spending).

One should aim for Perfect and make concessions when really needed. Plaintext SMS wallets are just .... not very secure. It's not how Bitcoin was meant the work **and** it's not secure.
It's nothing personal, and not an attack, just realism. SMS wallet are easy to attack by any entity (mass scale hackers, Govt, etc). and are not secured by the blockchain hashing power.
I'd say an SMS wallet is a good proof-of-concept. It could work with a 2-way challenge keyphrase on a solar-enabled smart-card. With a small Java/Google authenticator. Or maybe even an optional 2-way trezor style system where the owner actually owns the private keys and can do command &amp; control over the SMS wallet API.
 
@_date: 2014-12-28 07:45:44


There is. They "own" the bitcoins in their Bitpay wallet. Whether or not they convert to USD/Euros/Whatever, and in what percentage is unknown. 


Says who? No, it's a protocol, and beta software also. Bitcoin (the network big B) is an experiment, bitcoins are the first application and might or might not survive or adapt in one way or the other.


If I was was the devop/financial guy I would (at this point in time) rather let a third party do the processing. It's rather hard to try to re-invent the wheel (like I said, mempool monitoring algo's, blockchain forensics, legal issues). this might and will change in the future. Think of VPS/Hardware appliances with API you can plug into your EC2/Azure/Cloudstack infrastructure


In Microsoft's case, it's more of a marketing/experiment thing. I'd be surprised if they even processed more than 1% of the sales in bitcoins -at this point in time-
Yes, it's a legitimite use. I spent outputs on the blockchain to a Microsoft owned "Wallet". They give me stuff. It's using the Bitcoin blockchain while transacting bitcoins.

My question would be: Why does Gold have intrinsic value and bitcoins don't? I know Gold is tangible, and pretty, but So is Bitcoin imho. It's just not physical, it's electronic/digital in nature. Honest question.
Also, some mistakes: Supply rule is "hardware &amp; energy" if compared to mining mentioned with gold. SUpply rule change is not only the miners, the market decides as well. If Chinese miner X with 52% of he hashrate suddenly starts mining blocks with 50BTC reward, it won't be Bitcoin. My non-mining nodes will not accept those altcoin blocks.

What takes more water, "DDOSing" a bucket with 20 gallons or 1 gallon - considering the water is bitcoins - it would still require you to pay fee.
Hence my opinion is: It takes more bitcoins to DDOS (completely fill up) each block at 20MB then it does at 1MB.
In the logic of your argument: The results of a DDOS would be less if we lowered the blocksize to 0.5MB?

Fake it till you make it.
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:13:00
Kinda hard, because decentralised blockchains have no limit to access. You could make fake identities. What I mean is there is no 1:1 link to someone's identity.
If there was, that would centralise the blockchain because the Govt or entity that checks/links the identities would be a single-point-of-failure.
Voting *per person* is hard to do on a blockchain. Voting by Stake or Hashing power can be done. 
See Peercoin (PoS) and Bitcoin (mining).
What can be done, but is not really a blockchain system (no transactions are really needed) is a PGP type of signature system. Multisig: User can create an "address" on which he signs his SSN. The Govt. co-signs and thus a message can signed.
If the user would leak or get his private key stolen he could use the bureaucratic route to re-verify his identity, letting the Govt. co-sign system know his privkey is tainted. A new key would be generated that then would co-sign the replace the old one.
Essentially this could be done using the Bitcoin blockchain, but transactions would not really be needed. Could use the message verify/signature system.
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:48:51

Partially. I would recommend using a seperate OS bitcoin stuff, not your daily browsing machine.


THis is a choice you need to take yourself.


Windows simply is more mainstream and thus a larger vector of attack (virusses).

You have to realise that virusses are compiled on the fly, for you, in the case of Cryptolocker and also shitty driver sites.
These executables litterally have never seen before by your AV so they won't go off (unless you have behavioural detection, most enterprise grade AV have these. Still sometimes they slip though..).
Consider your machine tainted.

Depends on if you had Electrum or Bitcoin core. If you still have the electrum seed you can just re-download electrum and enter it.

It's not impossible. A Xeon can do up to 45 Megahash per second.
So with the diff at where it is right now you'd mine 0.00000292 BTC
per month. You'd be burning about 150 watts each hour so about 3.6Kwh per day or 111Kwh per month. At $0.10 per Kwh that would cost you $11 (aircon excluded).
0.00000292BTC is about $0,001898 so you mine about $0,022776 per year or about 2 cents.
Total amount you are burning $132 of power to make 2 cents worth of bitcoins per year.
Most mining pools payout at about $5 balance, so it will take 250 years to get a payout.

Blockchain is a scarce resource, you have to pay a small fee to get in. $3 for sending $8 is not realistic, it's more like $0.25 fee to get in a block within an hour.
In a few days Segwit activates, providing for more transactions per block, prob. resulting in somewhat lower fees.

THere's some, a $1 Bitcoin price with a hashrate like this is never, ever profitable. Like even when you have free power and miners that are 10% of retail value.
Other way around, $10,000,000 per BTC is also not sustainable because you could even mine $100s USD per day with 3 year old shitty Antminer S3's.
It does balance out a bit.

You could place a small 3 Kwh (or 3x1Kwh) miner in there, but it will still get pretty warm as a base level heating. Such a miner will output 3 Kwh of heat continuous, and you would need some second source to balance it out.
I have been playing around with calculators from electric heating companies like in the UK where it is pretty common.
Just remember that 1 Kwh of mining = 1Kwh of heat. 99.999% of the power usage becomes heat in a miner.

It's a feature of Bitcoin, transaction cannot be reversed once mined (+/- 6 blocks).
You are free to change the rules however. Just change the Code and give yourself some hardcoded bitcoins. That block won't be accepted by the Bitcoin network, and you'd be running FlamingNipplesOfFire-Coin.

Yes. Bitcoin's price is expressed in RMB or Euro because it is still one the dominant currencies, so it's a good way to "price" a coin.

Something is happening to the supply on a date that is known. Markets are not idiots, it's already "priced in". I'd even say we might see a small rise to $650 up to the date, and just before the halvening some traders will take profit. Back to $420

No, if this transaction is pushed with enough fee and is being mined there's almost no way of reversal. Once a block is mined on top of it, forget about reversal imho.

Depends... let's see what Warren says:


True. Note: He calls bitcoins money.


In the case of Bitcoin, not really that anonymous.




Checks are just "transactions" for the bank "blockchain", so not a very smart comparison.


*shrugs* that's why Western Union has a stock with a non-zero value I guess.


Lightning is coming.


Yes, there are thousands of altcoins.


It does not have intrinsic value, true - because it's not a physical "thing" - it does have utilised value imho (and the market agrees).
Overall I think Warren has a pretty good idea about Bitcoin's functionality, but not about Bitcoin economics. He's oldschool and insanely rich, Bitcoin is just a tiny speck on the radar and he shouldn't even bother. I'd love to own 1 [Berkshire Hathaway]( stock though......... just one is all I need ;)

Look at it like this: Mining is like opening a million doors, but the doors cannot be opened by going 1,2,3,4 because they have to have a "hash". So each miner tries random number, and hashes it.. 0x123 becomes 1. 0x321 becomes 2, etc.
It's not a sequencial process. And telling each other chip causes latency/bandwith problems. It would be more *energy efficient*, but you would get a huge drop in speed.

Contact Kraken.com - darkpool. Ask for Jesse.




The Kraken dark pool is an order book not visible to the rest of the market. Each trader only knows their own orders. Traders can anonymously place large buy or sell orders without revealing their interest to other traders. Typically, outsized orders, when seen by other traders will cause the market to move unfavorably, making it more difficult to fill the order at the desired price. This unfavorable price movement may be avoided in a dark pool.   
Kraken will charge an extra 0.10% for dark orders. Dark pool trading is available to all Kraken clients with accounts verified to Tier 2 or higher. The minimum dark order size is 50 bitcoins and only limit orders are supported. The dark pool will accept orders for trading between bitcoins and EUR, USD, JPY or GBP. Dark pool pairings are designated by a “.d” extension (e.g. XBT/EUR.d or XBT/USD.d).


Good luck. And please don't invest more then you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is a fickle thing.

Speculators can really only speculate on the rise of BTC, and only profit on a drop by selling the top.
But people can still short BTC by lending from a person and selling it. 
The friction/cost/risk to enter a long BTC: Low. The friction/costs/risk to get a short (without prior position): High.

As I wrote 16 days ago:


So they move Yuan to Bitcoin over P2P network, to Western exchange, and withdraw from exchange to bankaccount in EU/US.
What I think this does is creates buying pressure on the Chinese exchanges and selling pressure on the Western exchanges that have good liquid markets for withdraws.
Essentially the Western exchanges run dry of cash, while the Bitcoin supply increases. Aka, this could actually lead to price drops. In the new year the Chinese get to send $50,000 per person to foreign accounts, so that could be the moment some money arrives back at the Western exchanges (for arbitrage, speculation).
There is arbitrage possible if you could buy the BTC "cheap" on Western exchanges, and want to have Yuan in China (for whatever purposes... business transactions to factories maybe?).
I just wish exchanges had open-books, I'm pretty sure that my theory is correct. Just look at the premium on the Chinese exchanges, it makes perfect sense there's a risk calculated into it.
Disclaimer: I'm an idiot, this is not investment advice.

Except, you grossly underestimate the number of possible hashes &amp; nonces.
It's a 256 bit range, you know. A computer can't even count that high. 1.2.3.4.........all the way up to 2^256 would take more power than our sun emits. Try it, make a computer count all the way through those numbers.
How would you see this working? Do you realise how insane big of a number that is? If the wining hash is somewhere between 2 nodes it might never be found in your lifetime.
You have a huge misunderstanding of how SHA256 mining works.

     509 /Satoshi:0.8.1/ vulnerable
     380 /Satoshi:0.8.5/ vulnerable
So there's about ~1500 nodes running vulnerable version..
Let's check the CVE's for these versions:


THis only applies to miners, right? Only risk is if you're a miner and you run a very old version (possibly missing out on bitcoin profit by mining a broken block.


Worst case: the node crashes. Being such a medium to low number of nodes: Very low risk for network.


Worst case: the node crashes. Being such a medium to low number of nodes: Very low risk for network.


Worst case: Wrongly configged it's listening to API on the outside, Hacker could guess password and steal coins from outdated wallet running publicly on the internet. That kind of a user is, sorry, a bit dumb to do so, risk: for network:very low. For user: As expected.

Very cool idea.
A few questions:
* How do you regulate temperature? Let off extra heat, of do you stop/start the miners with a PID controller?
* When the sun is at Max. Do you stop the miners? Won't the greenhouse overheat?
* Won't building smaller greenhouses cause more heat radiotion loss per sqft of greenhouse? 
* You are off grid: How do you mine at night?
* What kind of plants?

Writing down the seed is all you need te restore. You can destroy/uninstall/format whatever you want and the seed will allways give you access to a newly installed wallet.




Only seed, password is not part of the recovery process.


Nope. But it's not bad security practice to make a backup of the wallet file, just in case. Just don't store it anywhere online. Oh and write down the password as well. And put it in a plastic bag or hammer it into a piece of stainless.
There have been people who lost the seed/backup by fire or flooding of the house.
PS The more important precaution is that the OS needs to be TOTALLY clean so don't use your daily shitty Windows box.

Why not? What defines real?




Citation needed.


Oh yes.




Again, why not? What is not real about them?






Quite possible.


That's a opinion to have, but it fails when you don't understand the dynamics.


go on


AHA! And such is the case with anything of "value" - it's a human construct


Those were short lived, and rotting bulbs is not exactly durable


That was a centralised scam


That lead to great things (current state of the INternet)


What is this, how does anything have intrinsic value? Where is that detirmed and by whom?


Oh yes, agree, there's a lot of speculation in Bitcoin! The price 


No, but that's missing the point. It's a settlement system, digital cash. 


The price of NVIDIA stock has also doubled. Bitcoin markets have become huge, with a lot of exchanges running at the same time. It's not some kind of soap-box with a guy on top selling bitcoins...


NO idea.


Sorry but that sounds really silly...[citation needed]


It's as real as ... well anything digital. Just because you can't hold it does not make it less real.

* 1. Because the market says so. If a gold miner digs up gold, why does it have monetary value? Bitcoin is nog pegged or backed by anything, except humans constructs of "value". Yes it's weird.
* 2. The miners will need to be rewarded with only fees
* 3. The mempool (where the transaction waits before getting included) is sorta like a marketplace. the 3rd party being the miner has no control over the transactions, he cannot change it. A single miner can decide to either include or not include the transaction.
* 4. What hash do you mean?

51% attacking Bitcoin can only Ddos so people can't transact and/or trust more than a few blocks deep from when the attack started.

Short term Bitcoin can do this pretty good. Like sending Converting USD to BTC, sending to your family, convert locally back to currency.
Medium term (weeks/months) it can get a bit volatile, but has pretty good performance on a 2Y basis. It performs a bit like bullion.

A somewhat risky method is lending out your BTC to shorters on Bitfinex.
You get a few % per month interest.
The risk is: if Bitfinex implodes: bye BTC. If they get hacked: Bye BTC. If they decide not to give it back.. same.

As you can see my calculations were off. So interesting to know is, what **is** Bitcoin using per day?
For the sake of some simplicity let's take the Antminer S9
* Power Consumption: 1372W + 10% (at the wall, with APW3 ,93% efficiency, 25C ambient temp)
* Power Efficiency: 0.098 J/GH + 10%(at the wall, with APW3 93% efficiency, 25°C ambient temp)
We don't care about efficiency, we want the power usage so we take 1372W.
Now it does 14TH/s while the network is at 2,000,000 TH right now. So we need about 142,857 Antminers to reach this rate. 
142,857 x 1372W = 196,000,000 Watt = 196 MWatt of power. 
Now the network is online 24h a day, so that's 196 x 24 = 4,704 MWh of electricity each day. Or 4.7GWh
This is not including the power needed for switches, routers, full nodes, servers, clients. Just pure hashing.

There's no technical blocklimit in the protocol. But most nodes have the hardcoded limit in place so if you mine a 1.1MB block the rest won't accept it. So you hardfork (you split off). Kinda like saying 1+1=3 in a world where 1+1=2 is reality (for now).
Bigblockers want to do this, while the SegWit camp is suggesting to put meta-data aside a block by making transaction IDs non-mutable. This creates about ~2.5MB of blockspace. it's a cool trick. It does not need a hardfork.

Technically you had 1BTC and still have 1BTC. The other coin could be of value but Bitcoin is not inflated/deflated.

Yes traveling with bitcoins can be risky, but storing on an exchange is a ...risk if you ask me. Remember MtGox? Not saying the ecosystem is as bad as it was, but "if you don't own the private keys you don't own the bitcoins".
What about a HW wallet like Trezor? You can add an extra word to the seed to insure a thief that finds your seed backup cannot restore. But don't forget that last word or the coins are gone.

* Datacenters switch to diesel power but run out in about 10 hours.
* All payment systems are disabled in a few hours.
* Hospitals soon cannot handle IC and OR rooms, fridges fail, serum and insuline starts going bad in a few days.
* Police and riot police will have trouble keeping order, stores will be looted, etc.
* Airports PAPI / Tower / fails - Int. travel is shut down in hours.
* Fires etc can break out but there's not way to call 911 or do anything about it
* Infrastructure stops working almost directly, most bridges that are automated to not have backup power and the internet starts degrading pretty fast.
* Internet access is only possible using Sat. connection. DSL goes first, cable next and finally fiber.
* Cellphone towers have Battery power but only for a short while, NO_SIGNAL in about 12 hours max.
* Markets crash outside the nation, not really knowing what's going on?

Core is a full client, it will download the entire blockchain (100s of GB). Knots is a spin-off, but also heavy. Electrum is a "SPV" lightweight wallet.
That said, the Windows machine needs to be really clean and secure to store coins on it. THere's a lot of malware out there that steals your coin if it sees Electrum wallet (or any wallet). Sometimes they even capture your keystrokes.

Interesting observation. True unless you convert to USD, then it becomes a real gain.


Hoarding money and/or currency could be considered saving. In a lot of countries this was considered a very cautious form of "investing" with literally almost zero risk and sometimes up to 5% gains per year. (mostly inflation correction)
Bitcoin's network does not pay interest, and surely does NOT have zero risk. Also it's not a currency. My Govt. tax agency says they are "Private money" but not currency (and NOT protected as such). 
There's that.

first question: why?
Anyway, quick 101 guide: Buying: at an Exchange. In the US: Coinbase or Kraken. Storing: Get a hardware wallet above $500 worth of bitcoins. Trezor is the best bike, followed by Ledger nano S. Backup: Keep the generated backup offline and safe out of view. Put in somewhere safe.
never store coins on an exchange. beware scammers, always.

Domain Forrest are best practice and very [common]( in Enterprise networking when dealing with semi B2B. For exampl different business units that require certain amounts of trust to certain parts of the network/AD/Domain. Combined with Federation Services, ACL's and other AD tooling one can make the most simple or bizarro trust relationship combine with SQL. Furthermore, SQL has built in cryptography (link I posted before).

If you have a good exchange available in your country with stable banking connections to convert to local currency: Yes. prob? But don't expect many to pay with BTC it's not used that much.

Yes. But are these VPS nodes? They might share a single deduplicating SAN (like Dell Equallogic, Nutanix, etc) so that each storage block is only stored on one spinning disk/SSD.  You can hack around this by encrypting the filesystem so the hypervisor is forced to store each block 10x. (in your case).
If you rent 10U of rackspace it's properly helping Bitcoin.

Don't attack me, just speculating here. Ideas?
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:36:19
Mmm not really I think. You are off with the math.


A Butterfly Jalepino does 5GH/s. That's 5,000 Megahash/s, or 5,000,000 Kilohash/s
A generic Dell lattitide does about 25 KH/s. You'd need 200,000 Dell machines to mine as fast a 5Gh/s Butterfly ASIC miner.
And those are so shitty in 2017 they would only mine about $1 **in a year**. 
Now a modern miner does 1000Gh/s (Antminer S5). Using 2000watts of power.
If you want to make the ASIC chips keep track of what they have done (and when the others needs to do) you run into bandwith problems. These are 256 bit hashes they make, so  it's generating a whopping 256 bit * 5,000,000,000 = 1.280.000.000.000 bits of data / 8 = 160.000.000.000 bytes = 149 Terabyte/s of data.

Do you have electric heating? If no; depends on your gas price vs electrical rates.
Sanse the fact that you can't really modulate the heat output of a miner except by turning it off and on as modulation. 
Also: Noise.

depending if the network stays online and mining still works properly... I think it would go up in appreciation. If the USD crashed it would not really make sense to price anything in USD. It would be more like "Howmuch BTC/Gold/Chickens for that bread".

Most likely it's very expensive/risky/impossible to get (large) volumes of USD out of Indian exchange and moved to non-Indian exchange (to do the actual arb).

True, Quantum could break Pubkey to Privkey. But Bitcoin does not expose a pubkey because an address is an Hashed (SHA256+RIPEMD16) form of the pubkey. Bitcoin security does not use SHA in the address security layer, it's ECDSA.


Not counterfeit, steal


We know. Crypto almost never fails 0-day, more than enough to time to upgrade signing algo. Although it does require a HF when changing ECDSA.

While I'm not against such a thing...... good luck with your altcoin/hardfork.
Hardforking anything economic like 1) blocksize, 2) fee system, 3) coinbase-reward or 4) max. amount of coins will fork it into 2 Bitcoin blockchains.
hardforks for bugs can and have been done.

There is some incentive as a Bitcoiner. No nodes = no network = No Bitcoin.
But there is no direct compensation for the externality cost. And creating compensation would imply a very controversial Hardfork. Also it would create "fake" nodes that share a single disk in a single datacenter. I mean if I get a deduplicating SAN storage I could spool up 1000s of nodes that share 1 disk - basically.
Nope. Sorry.

They (Chinese) want to have *registered value*. But sending yuan to USD to an offshore account is limited by the govt.
So they move Yuan to Bitcoin over P2P network, to Western exchange, and withdraw from exchange to bankaccount in EU/US.
What I think this does is creates buying pressure on the Chinese exchanges and selling pressure on the Western exchanges that have good liquid markets for withdraws.
Essentially the Western exchanges run dry of cash, while the  Bitcoin supply increases. Aka, this could actually lead to  price *drops*. In the new year the Chinese get to send $50,000 per person to foreign accounts, so that could be the moment some money arrives back at the Western exchanges (for arbitrage, speculation).
There is arbitrage possible if you could buy the BTC "cheap" on Western exchanges, and want to have Yuan in China (for whatever purposes... business transactions to factories maybe?).
I just wish exchanges had open-books, I'm pretty sure that my theory is correct. Just look at the premium on the Chinese exchanges, it makes perfect sense there's a risk calculated into it.

I think (but this is a guess) your database is broken. You did the right thing backing up the wallet.dat. Save it to external USB thumb-drive or DVD as soon as possible.
Close Bitcoin-core. (if it's not closed already)
Check you diskspace. Do you have 100GB free space?
Then, move everything from that directory (c:\users\you\Bitcoin\) to a new location (just to be sure). Keep wallet.dat in place!
Then start Bitcoin-core. It will re-sync.

That Turbo is wrong, that pipe is where the cool air comes out on the compression side. The piece with the square thing is where the hot (exhaust) goes through, and comes out on the side.
Otherwise, it does kinda compare to Segwit as a turbocharged engine has the *same* displacement in CC (blocksize) but has an increased amount of O2 molecules per 4-stroke because the compresses more air into the cillinder (using the exhaust to power a "pump"). Also, while the inlet pressure is increased the diesel engine. also increases the amount of fuel (fees?) that is injected by either the Common rail or the Line-pump.
So turbocharged engine == Segwit.
Is that the point you wanted to make?

TL;DR: "*OMG EU Bans Bitcoin.....Or no, not really though.*
I've only skimmed through this, but how can we have missed this a community?
There are some nasty things in there, like definitions on 
* who this covers (hint: every business moving money in any way) 
* certain features the payment system **must** have (hint: needs to be reversible, etc.. etc..).
* it does not really allow charges if you pay online or in a shop (hello Bitcoin Fee system!)
**Link to direct HTML browsable text (in English**
Let's discuss this text and see if it applies to anything Bitcoiny.
Interesting finds (ongoing):
* Chapter 3: (exceptions) does not specificly mention Bitcoin, but it does say (a) *payment transactions made exclusively in cash directly from the payer to the payee, without any intermediary intervention;* and (f) *cash-to-cash currency exchange operations where the funds are not held on a payment account;*
* Chapter 3: (excluded) *(h) payment transactions carried out within a payment or securities settlement system between settlement agents, central counterparties, clearing houses and/or central banks and other participants of the system, and payment service providers, without prejudice to Article 35;* **does Bitcoin fit this??**
* Chapter 4: Art. 59 - " ...Payments shall be made in the currency agreed between the parties...." Good?
* Article 4: (6) "
(6) The most close description of Bitcoin in the entire legal text: *‘remote payment transaction’ means a payment transaction initiated via internet or through a device that can be used for distance communication;"*
Anyone brave enough to just ask the EU if this includes or excludes Bitcoin &amp; Crypto?

Going from 2^8 to 2^16 is nothing compared from going from 2^16 to 2^32. That's not "twice" but multiple magnitudes more entropy. QC is not all that good for pubkey-&gt;privkey.
Anyway, if pubkey-&gt;privkey ECDSA within hours starts to be possible, it it very much possible (incentive) to upgrade and include more (multisig) signing algo's.
A zero-day bug that breaks ECDSA would however kill Bitcoin, yes.

Wallet security does not rely on SHA-256. If SHA-256 starts breaking mining might be affected (diff will adjust though).
Also, addresses could be reversed to pubkey (not privkey) but that would mean RIPEMD-160 should be broken.

Bitcoin Core won't become obsolete. If the devs don't change opinions and XT does have the largest hashing rate, it would be like a dank zombie version of Bitcoin.

Value is not created from nothing, that would make value itself worthless. Value and Bitcoin's value are made by hard work and the store of value in the form of laybour.
@_date: 2015-08-18 10:14:12
Very nice. Much appreciated. It would be nice to have a function that splits up change into chunks that are random. For instance you have a 1 BTC balance, and want to send 0.1BTC to Joe. If the remaining 0.9BTC goes to 1 change address it can be tracked very easy, but what if you send random values (0.14 - 0.34 - 0.22 - etc) to new addresses. There is no way of knowing if *you* own it or if that was the main transaction. Maybe even segment the transaction to Joe with multiple addresses/outputs. 
Sure if you spend the remaining 0.9, it needs to combine outputs, but it would be harder to track because it creates more uncertainty. The chunks that are combined could be Joe's, or they could be mine. Because the chunks are random there is no way of knowing.
Or, only make 0.005 chunks, so that a large amount of the addresses in the UTXO end up with 0.005 - it's like hiding in plain sight by all wearing the same clothes.
However, this would bloat the blockchain.
Just something I was thinking about lately.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:38:21

Most Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are very trackable and traceable. This property is not so good for illicit use like terrorism and other criminal acts.


Do you mean impact of the chance of it happening? The chances are kinda high of happening. It's going on all the time. [Wiki](
But the impact is mostly low, it's small number of people (but still horrible of course). 
The risk for *National Security* is not that high.


For *funding* only? I don't think so. Some more anonymous crypto (Dash, etc). might be used for laundering, or for transporting, but not for *funding*.

Problem is: If you want to ban "Bitcoin" - how? What do you make illegal? Storage of value in non-fiat? what about Gold? Or storage of ... numbers?
If they ban Bitcoin, what about Litecoin? If they ban all "coins" what about NXT? Ripple?...?

Because the pubkey to address hashing can't be reversed, your pubkey is safe against (for example) quantum attacks.
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:40:03
I know. But that's brute forcing. I think there could be some improved method but still it would take massive amounts of power to crack 1 pubkey&gt;privkey. So making it multisig (100 keys or more) would make it increasingly impossible.
1/10 not a very good attack vector. Weakening the RNG is much better as an attack vector.

At it's core Bitcoin needs a network infrastructure to work, but it's very possible to use any form of communication to access such a node.
One could use QR codes, Fax, audio, DTFM, HAM radio... but it's not a very good user experience.

You and I don't know how the consensus is *until* it happens. It's a stake game, the "Crowd" with the largest amount of coins will win because they can sell the "wrong side of the chain" into the ground.
* The miners decide what chain will the most secure.
* The nodes will decide what chain will the most agile/fast/adaptive.
* The exchanges will decide what chain will the most liquid and valuable compared to local fiat. Even if the miners have only 30% of the power. compared to the other. 
I'm neutral on this. My (28) nodes are still on vanilla. Imho we should not hardfork (yet).

You know what's missing. Warnings about running proper anti-virus etc when handling bitcoins.
Novice users have lost bitcoins by not thinking about that before. Also remind them to use the backup procedure.
**ALSO** I would highly recommend recommending a iPhone/Android wallet instead of a webwallet etc.... phones are mostly secure by design. And the QR scanning etc is seperate from the OS so that's also covere.

* Laptops. I remember the mid-90s to 2001-is when only the top of mgmt would have a laptop - it was really something expensive and terrible, terribly heavy and clunky.

Essentially the market will decide what chain is "Bitcoin".

Personally I think Bitcoin has bigger problems than its current 1MB cap. Like PR, image (scammy scamster gonna scam), public opinion, Bitlicense, legal issues. The consensus required to move to 8MB blocks is not there at the moment, and will break Bitcoin at this moment. What do you think?

Use Bitpay.com if you are a merchant, they do a good job at this.
A normal sized tranaction, with proper fee, should be pretty hard to "double spend". I'd trust any sub-1BTC transation with 0-conf just fine if
* Outputs are normal size
* Outputs are mined at least 10 blocks back
* Fee is ok
* Propagation is ok (it's in my own bitcoin-core wallet/node's mempool).

But it is... it is really that cheap. I don't like the fact that people are stress testing the network, but it just takes a few weeks of preparation. They prepare thousands of sub-wallets with confirmed transaction dust. And let them move those outputs all at once.
That's how they seem to do it now. This is not an attack, because this is normal usage of the Blockchain. Now I agree that disk space and block distribution will be slower, and that forking is very very dangerous, but saying it's not a problem is like sitting in your house while it's on fire.

Cost-Benefit for hackers. Macs run on a ripped off version of BSD (well, in a way) - this is a very hardened OS, and mostly pretty secure. But in case you start running adaptive virusses yourself (by running random applications you download from the internet) you can and will still get a "virus".
Now the holes in OS that leave for execution of computer code without the user actively doing anything, those are starting to appear in Apple just like in Windows. Some are rather obscure like the OP article, but in this case it infects the lower layers of the Apple device not even the OS itself.
Pretty scary. Please run AV, always update asap (Flash/Adobe included) and don't run DMG files from obscure sources.

"Just"? Yes, thus securing the entire blockchain - for what it's worth (a $1B market cap). 
So mining is a) securing the existing blockchain, b) processing tranactions and c) bootstrapping/distributing the native token (bitcoins) among the world population, limiting it by energy usage, while there is a block reward (currently 25BTC).
FYI/Imho: I still think there's way way too much energy put into mining for Bitcoin's current usage though.

Well same thing with real coins - it's called "Coin grading".
A coin that has never seen circulation is more valuable then its face value because of the novelty factor ("Fleur de Coin" - aka never been used).
it's not like this degrades the value of normal coins, it's just that some collectors value them as a collectors item.

I don't think raising the blocksize to infinity will fix the problem but 1MB is unacceptable. The 1MB cap was there to prevent spam and was chosen randomly when Bitcoin was really really small. Removing it is nothing special. I think a 10MB block size is pretty ok for a few years so the network can keep working as-is and Lightning/Blockstream/etc. can mature.

1. They are Exchanges. They are businesses doing trades for you on the blockchain. They don't do anything related to Bitcoin's actual safety. TL;DR the supermarkets of BItcoin.
2. Get a trezor hardware wallet if you have any large amount of coins. Otherwise use Electrum.org on a dedicated laptop that runs a secure operating system

Mistake you are making is that mining blocks only is done for transactions. This is not entirely correct, mining is also done to keep the blockchain secure hence protecting every user/wallet using it ( Bitcoin's value, in a way).

Money talks. write a business case why "Accepting bitcoin" for your business brings either more clients in, or increases profit.
Also, don't push this too hard. Most people don't understand. Also, most companies "Accepting Bitcoin" only do it for the novelty. It's not like 50% of the sales in in Bitcoin or something. More like sub 1%.
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:37:38
Good point. So by making the transacting across the globe more easy, it creates a huge, efficient decentralised economy instead of each town having a basic economy?
@_date: 2015-07-03 07:37:35


Mmm yes maybe you could. If you would tell a miner "Hey, I'll give you 125% of the BTC for the same amount of electricity it would take for mining that amount of you give me the Kwh" they would take the deal. 
Miners offer a liquidity pool. There would be a pretty large spread and it would not be very deep but it is there.

True true. The alert would be raised BUT it would be very hard to move coins from ECDSA to MagicNewSigningAlgo because the exploit could intercept the txn, calc the privkey from pubkey within 10 minutes and doublespend with high fee.
It would be messy.

Ok this is going to be important, because other EU members mostly uses other country's stances for theirs **and** because of the "Freedom of goods &amp; services" law they have to apply the same rules.

If there was no mining power left one could very easy (having 50% of the power) change whatever they wanted about the protocol, and could even make your coins unspendable. Mining power causes the network to be secure against double spending and reversal of old blocks.

* ~~de~~centralised platform
* ~~Open Source~~ closed source
* ~~Distribution of coins by PoW~~ Premine
* Disitributed network
* ~~Public~~ ledger
OK. So what have we got here? I think I found a solution for this use-case. It's called a [**DATABASE**](
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:13:11
Yes, but only **if** someone is going to max out 20MB blocks for days to weeks. As I calculated that must be someone who really really hates Bitcoin spending so many millions to harm it.
To be fair, a 300GB datacap is exactly top-notch for a home connection. The USA has pretty shitty Internet because of the ISP having too much of a monopoly.
I mean my Android has 4G internet at 20 to 50Mbit (phone) and has a 40GB datacap after that it's **unlimited** at 10Mbit speed. That's a phone. My 90 yo granny has 60Mbit unlimited VDSL out in the sticks.
You should consider renting a VPS if you want to help by running a Node. Weloveservers has a VPS with 2GB and a 1TB monthly cap for like $5 a month.
I'm afraid you won't be able to run a node from hom if that stays like that. Depending on what Third world your are referring to, most people in poverty are not going to run a node anyway, and there is plenty of decent infrastructure in South Africa to host nodes. India is TW but has a good internet infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:53:27

Does not matter, factually wrong. Hashing is about signing, there is no "data" encrypted.
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:19:01


Well the blocks **are** full right now. And people are not really raising it by *that* much.
And how does it invalidate my calculations? If the 20MB blocks get full artificially, this means it would (by your argument) even more expensive to DDOS the network in the ~15 to 20MB of block space.
Result: Network keeps running, attacker is only wasting money.

* SEPA is reversed

Well yes. If boogers were a scarce, time consuming (labour intensive) asset it could be used as a bartering asset. Like uhm.....[Ambergris](
But you can't really transport them over a digital communication channel, and they don't store very well (they rot). So there's that.
Bitcoins are made (while securing itself) by using the purest form of energy: Electricity. It makes the distribution more fair in a sense that one cannot get his hands on too much without using actual  "labour".

Sorry, such thing as "free electricity". Once you start putting a significant amount of miners in there, and start consuming 10s of Kwh per day, your landlord will notice and he won't like it.
If you really have free electricity, I'd like to buy like 10,000 Kwh per day from you, contact me. I'll pay you $0.0005 per Kwh, so that's a good $5 daily for "free". Good deal?

At this moment this transactions has 0. This does not mean the coins are "gone" in any way, they are in the old address still. Since you also own that wallet there 0% risk.

Yep, this. Bitcoin is all about hashing. And they want to ban encrypted communication channels - so even the wallet-side of Bitcoin (sometimes does use encryption to secure the privkeys on the filesystem) is fine. Otherwise offline signing is the way to go (or Trezor).
Banning encryption does nothing but alert the terrorist that their communication channel is compromised. They will use even harder to detect methods of obscuring their communication.

Except it's even more rare. Gold can be [synthesised](


But, it *is* possible and when Gold would be the reserve currency of the world *once again*, you can bet your ass it can be done without being too expensive.
And quote from the [scientific paper](




GeV are reported. The observed yields of the gold isotopes show a similar dependence on mass number for each reaction, differing slightly in the position of the centroid of the. distribution. As the projectile energy increases,the inferred excitation energy of the primary residues remains the sameor decreases slightly. This observation is in agreement with the pre-dictions of the intranuclear cascade model of relativistic heavy ioncollisions.￼


contributions were assumed to be negligible.
TL;DR. Shoot Bismut (metal) and . Get Gold (isotopes).

Yes, but one could make the asics do this *on-chip* by using a very low level form of networking.

* Privacy: You are moving coins through the same address over and over, that makes finding out your flows more easy. Bitcoin-core (and most wallets) use change addresses because of this. [more](
* Security (although theoretical) - one you spend coins from an address, you expose the public key - in theory that would deriving the private key more easy.

Bitcoin does not have to use encryption to function. It uses hashing. The only part of Bitcoin that optionally uses encryption is the wallet encryption (you know, the password thingy). This could be bypassed by using like a Ledger or a Trezor - The key is stored on the device.
If encryption is banned in the UK they'll become the IT laughing stock of the world. No sane company would use any UK IT infrastructure.
If one would want to use a *secure, undetectable communication channel* (that's what they're actually trying to ban, but they don't understand technlogy so they're grasping at the straws) - one could always use [steneography](

Does the server moneypacket.org hold the privatekey? Or does it stay in Browser-land?
Because either case has its very own security problems. The first option (moneypacket has the privkey at some point) is totally broken. If it stays in browser-land, the PC of the sender **and** the receiver needs to be secure. 
Or maybe a multisig 3-of-4 would be better.
* Moneypacket has Key 1
* Sender has key 2+3+4(backup)
* Receiver gets key 2, and let's sender *and* MP sign upon swiping balance. (over SMS? Phone?).
This is a good idea, but it needs some further dev.
Keep it up.

Bitcoin mining is not only for transaction processing. So that's the mistake they make.
So mining is a) securing the existing blockchain, b) processing tranactions and c) bootstrapping/distributing the native token (bitcoins) among the world population, limiting it by energy usage, while there is a block reward (currently 25BTC).
If (for example) I made 1 transactions and there would no transaction whatsoever for an hour after that (for whtever reason) and the miners would mine empty blocks, the blocks before it would still be secured because "proof of work" makes it harder and harder to outrun the miners (and try to do a 51% or forking shenanigans).
The 4 to 6 confirmations would give me security in a sense that my txn would be irreversible.
It's like a big clock ticking away sealing everything behind it. Without the clock ticking, Bitcoin dies.
FYI/Imho: I still think there's way way too much energy put into mining for Bitcoin's current usage though.

That's interesting, but requires more than 51% because you need to "un-wind" all the blocks backwards and find new blocks with the right hash/diff.
So it would get harder and harder. But indeed mining about 10 blocks backwards could be done, if you have 80% of the mining power or in that ballpark.

@_date: 2015-07-24 08:19:19


Can't really do that though. What you can do is make a txn that takes the same outputs of a transaction already in mempool, and mine it into the next block. "Outrunning". Analogous About the same as stealing back your cash after you made a cash transaction.
That mining pool will loose all its credibility as soon as it does that = That pool is going to loose its miners.

Fair point. But. And do what with 51% ? Can't spend other people's coins.
They could outrun the rest and kinda "pause" the blockchain, and reverse blocks, but can't really do much else. It would harm Bitcoin but they would need to keep burning Kwhs for days, weeks and months on end to keep ahead. If they stop: GOne is the 51%.

Not really. If we are talking people using Internet (The WWW, and Email) that went like this in Europe:
* 1990 to 1995 - barren wasteland. I'd guess only geeks, some IT business and rich folk used it
* 1995 to 1997 - the Dialup revolution happened. About 20 to 30% of households started getting 33k6 and 57k6 dialup (some rich/companies went for ISDN).
* 2001: First (CRAPPY!!) Cable and ADSL providers en-masse started rolling out. Unlimited dialup (0800 numbers) was a short lived hype. Most cities got ADSL coverage up to 2003/4. I had a job in ISP/Hosting - lots of mass-rollouts - warehouses full of DSL routers. The horror.
* 2003 to 2007 was the time the remaining 30% of the outskirts/urban went to ADSL/cable. I think around 70% had broadband in 2007.
* 2007 to 2010 was more stale, speed quadrupled from 15Mbit to 60+Mbit. I'd say 95% of the households had 5Mbit or faster at this point.
* 2013: My dad (85) got Internet, the last of its kind.
So it took almost 10 to 15 years for total adoption.

Filling up a 1MB block (3TPS @ 0.0001BTC fee) is around **0.18BTC** in fees. Filling up a 20MB block is 20x as much so **3.6BTC**.
So to fill an entire day of block
* 1 day of 1MB blocks = ~26BTC = **~ $6894**
* 1 day of 20MB blocks = ~518BTC = **~ $137,000**
So I'd want to make the argument here that **20MB blocks make the attack on Bitcoin a lot more difficult.**.
[ITIL Risk Assessment]( dictates: **Risk = Probability * Impact.**
WIth a 20MB block the Risk is lower because the Probability is 20x lower or at least a fraction. The impact is about the same. Imho it would lower the risk from **Unacceptable Catastrophic Failure** to an **Acceptable risk** level, still needing further fixing though.
For an attacker to spam the network for a **month** with 1MB  blocks it would only cost him **$213,714**. With 20MB blocks it's close to 5 Million. Sure there are people with that kind of money, but the latter is way more in the corporate range and no company is going to openly attack Bitcoin.
Just do it.
* Raise the blocksize to 20MB.
* Raise the fees to at least 0.0003 minimum (trippling my numbers above, so making 20MB over half a Million per day).
* Be done with it for a few years - giving Sidechains™ and other Voodoo time to mature.

If (for example) I made 1 transactions and there would no transaction whatsoever for an hour after that (for whtever reason) and the miners would mine empty blocks, the blocks before it would still be secured because "proof of work" makes it harder and harder to outrun the miners (and try to do a 51% or forking shenanigans).
The 4 to 6 confirmations would give me security in a sense that my txn would be irreversible.
It's like a big clock ticking away sealing everything behind it. Without the clock ticking, Bitcoin dies.

Problem with this though is that in the beginning of your life (like when you're 20) you want to buy a house, but you can't afford it - morgage it is. When you're old you earn more, kids are out of the house and when you're really! old (80) you've got money/house when you don't really need it.

Transactions are *instantly* (well takes a few ms, but ok) *verifiable as valid*. If you pay me I can instantly verify:
* That you paid me the proper amount to an address in my control.
* See that you paid proper fee so I can be confident that it will be included soonish.
* See that you have the funds
* Monitor that you're not outrunning the txn
With the right amount of fee and some other blockchain monitoring I'd say it's pretty secure to accept bitcoins with 0-confirms (like Bitpay does).
But they are not set in stone to the point a few blocks are mined on top of it, true.

2. Call your bank if you want to be sure this is ok with them. If this bank is important for you or your business, be highly cautious doing Bitcoin stuff with it. Bitcoin is considered "high risk" and having you account flagged can be very annoying.
3. Not if you ask your bank first see 
4. BTC is not very anonymous. PS: Get a hardware wallet for such an amount. 
5. I'm not very familiar with US tax law.

OK you are good I think. Relax for now. Wanrning, the next steps can be dangerous. I would suggest swiping the balance with Jaxx using "Import Paper wallet" (swiping the key).
To get the private key (from console)
    electrum getprivatekeys -w .electrum/wallets/default_wallet -W yourpasswordhere 1Youraddresswithbalancehere
If your electrum is really old it could give an error, let me know. WHATEVER YOU DO NOT PASTE OR GIVE THAT PRIVATEKEY TO ANYONE.
Then, swipe that private key with Jaxx (top: Tools: Transfer paper wallet, enter the private key). Or on your new Electrum wallet on a secure system.
Wanrning: own risk. Your phone needs to be secure. Your PC needs to be secure.

Ok, now your question. Do we need Bitcoin there. Well uhhm, If you ran a node there and the mining is on earth you'd have really shitty block propagation. NASA's DSN (deep space network) could handle 1MB of bandwith, but the latency is like a 13 to 24 minutes. So slow transfer times, etc.

No the extra supply will go down (the daily, monthly) and it's never going back up. It will effect price, but not as much as we would think imho. To use the old saying "it's already priced in".

I just wanted to remind you what happend to E-gold. If you don't understand what happend there and what can happen with IOU tokens on a blockchain you cannot be saved.
No, I think Gold is very valuable, but it works because you *hold* it yourself. If you put everything under the control of one company 3 things can happen: It gets stolen, seized or they do an exit scam. And because your tokens ONLY are IOU at that company that is huge counterparty risk.
I'm not saying DigiX is a scam. They seem to be very professional. But bad actors or govt can come into play. Bitcoins in your wallet are very hard to seize. Physical bars in a vault are not.

Also, he's talking about "government" - what legisation is he talking? Brazil? EU? USA? Big differences imho. Govt. is just a group of people elected by the people (in case of a democracy).
Anyway, good content, but I'm not sure if I can agree with stolfi on everything he says. And I don't think Govts. are "evil" for allowing BTC or banning it - mostly I think they don't care because Bitcoin isn't that big or used that much.

A lot of shit comments in this topic.
They did seem to have made a pretty serious appourch of a "blockchain" type of database. The whitepaper is worth reading:
I honestly think this is somewhat of a threat to Bitcoin, technically this looks very advanced already for such a young project. The only thing that Bitcoin project has an advantage is the politics and market cap of the native token.
if you look at this, they seem to have made a "Sidechain" type of sub-chain infrastructure. 
This is not Open, this made to kill the Bitcoin project. I suggest we seriously read into this, instead of brushing it aside. They kinda made a Eth/Ripple/Bitcoin hybrid from the ground up.
**How about concensus?**
Well my Bitcoin friends. There seem to be 3 options at this moment. None (lol), PBFT (broken by sibble-attack), and last but not least SIEVE.

There is not a single creating entity in Bitcoin
Bitcoin has protection - to some extend - against "creating out of nothing". It takes burning of electricity to get to coins. This prevents someone from taking all the coins. It's literally about burning money (Kwh) to get rewarded BTC while protecting it.
One could say it's unfair for those with expensive power, but it's pretty good as an experiment imho.


I did not say it should be private entity. But not 1 Govt. 
PS The main problem with your view on Bitcoin is - imho - You call it a currency but it's not. It's more like a digital asset or a bearer instrument (your privkeys are the instrument to the blockchain's native token).

Actually they do. And so do exchanges. Even if Bitcoin hardforked and the majority does not move to the "new chain" they still get to "vote" like happend with ETH classic.
They get to sell off the "fake" coins on the "wrong" (from their reality) side of the chain.

A *large part* of the ßitzz$oin mining is done on *multiple* pools that are controlled by operators in China.
But they a) don't own all the mining hardware and b) it's not *all* mining.

You're right. But that's not entirely what I meant - I meant it as: If it's banned, criminals will still use it. More so, everyone who uses it will be a criminal..  like ;)


Supply will not drop, it will stay the same (12.5BTC per block). Demand might drop, but it might also *increase* because banning something (in case of, for example, capital flight scenario causing a ban because of a failing govt. currency) could actually increase the attention it receives.
I think what you mean is the markets will be illiquid (with a shifting [solvency cone]( ) - that's a different thing. Bitcoins sellers will be very scarce and hard to find, and buyers will find themselves paying a very high premium because of shallow *and* fragmented market depth (order books will all be dark, sans exchanges).


Fair enough, but if Western Govts. start working together (this is very rare!) to *ban Bitcoin* it would mean it is either a serious threat to the population, or to the financial system.
In the latter, one could wonder if Bitcoin is actually that powerful that it needs to be banned instead of shrugged away.
Question to you would be: How would a Bitcoin ban look? Would it also include other blockchains and what would the definition of such a ban be?
@_date: 2016-09-10 08:35:25

if there was no fee, it would be impossible to seperate true transactions from trolling/spam mess.

Old nodes may not accept blocks created by new nodes.
With a hardfork, everyone (miners, users, and merchants) will need to upgrade to the new code.

The mining network is not a single entity, it's composed of pools that are composed of hundreds (maybe a few thousand max) of individual persons each controlling their own hashrate. Although I want to say that an alarming amount is in China before you bring up that argument.
Satoshi did create Bitcoin, but the coins themselves (sans the ones he premined) are not issued, given *by him* or controlled *by him* in any way.


This is not true. Let's take the word "meant" en go back to the first intention of Bitcoin - The Whitepaper. The word currency is not mentioned, it is defined as "digital cash". Cash is not currency. 
USD is a currency, and USD coinage is cash. But cash settlement can also be done with 1 Oz. Phil. Harmoniker Silver coins.
I know Wikipedia is not a good scientific source, but I think this describes it;


I think there are 4 questions here
* Is it money?
* Is it currency and/or does it behave as currency?
* Is it cash and/or does not behave as cash?
* It is a commodity?
No for example an [American Gold Eagle]( - Is it money? Well kinda. Is it cash - kinda, it can be used for a cash settlement. Is it a commodity - the stuff that it is made of is, but it's more than that because it falls under the [Gold Bullion Coin Act 1985](  os 
Imho Bitcoin is the first *Digital* (as in, electronic, lives on computers) form of *Cash Settlement* (as in, it behaves like physical tokens) 
It is money. It's not currency - no govt recognizes it as such - and it is not in common use especially not by a govt. It is cash, non reverisble - but one cannot hold the coins only the keys to the UTXO. So is it a commodity? No, because it has no physical form. 
So I think Digital Cash is the best description. It's cash, but not tangible. First of it's kind.


It does not have to be *used as currency* it is clearly used as cash settlement on *cough* [some markets](*cough* and to some degree on gambling/betting websites. Value is a human construct and with all things humans value comes from the utility as a tool to make transactions. I might say "It's worth $1!" but clearly the invisible hand of the market does not agree. 
Why is anything worth anything? Because we say/think so.
Are you Satoshi?

That's an opinion. I personally favour non-govt. You are free to choose otherwise.


miners don't keep the coin, they burned electricity, time and hardware investment for it. mining is very competitive and hardly profitable. what they do make is more like a reward for the work they do. 
If mining was free you would be right, but it's not. It serves as a distribution model until the block reward is near 0.


Is it? It's volatile, sure. The market is super-small (a few thousand participants at best active in the market). But it's still alive and over the years has gone up. It's used on Darknet markets and in countries where money cannot easyly be transferred in or out. It's a niche but it is used. It's not used by millions, but at least by thousands.

if quantum becomes powerful enough it might be possible to reverse pubkey to privkey the moment the txn enters mempool (so before it is mined) and double spend the txn.
But that won't happen all at once, though. there will be signs of quantum being a threat years before it's fast enough to be that effective.

Could work like this:
The recipient makes a multisign txn 3 of 4. It will contain 2 outputs: Delivery guy will get $10 for delivery, Sender gets funds from recipient of goods. 
But they can't get the money unless: He delivers the goods and scans the final privkey. If there's fraud the recipient can reverse the transactions.
* Delivery guy has incentive to deliver, otherwise gets nothing.
* Recipient has control over funds up to the point he gets the goods
* Sender has could do a second transactions with delivery guy with a bounty to prevent him running away with the goods.
Optionally there can be an 3rd party escrow that holds 1 of 5 keys to be able to to arbitration in case of scammy situations.

Won't happen. I've said this before but the BTC-Boat is full of get-rich-quickers at the moment. Not really a problem, but there's just too many of them. And all with different price targets anywhere between the yearly-low and current price. So there's soooooo much profit taking - combined with option/future trading - on the way to $1200 that it really takes a huge catalyst to get it going.
$850 by december would be reasonable. But it could as well be $550
Look at the last bubble (november 2013) on log view. Now compare it with the 2011 one. The leg sideways after the correction is the same size, but 3x as big. So we have at least 6 to 10 months of current pricelevels left.

So what *is* Bitcache?
@_date: 2016-09-10 10:14:06
False. It can be corrected, if the concensus is there. Bitcoin has had multiple hardforks. 
* 8th August 2010 - 92 billion BTC were made into existence. Bitcoin rolled back about 4 to 6 hours of blocks.
* 11th March 2013 - A bug in the DB system created "false" blocks on 0.8 chain. Bitcoin had to hardfork to fix this.
Hardforking aka correcting the normal way of things is just really, really controversial because nobody has control over the ledger centrally. Hardforks only work is everyone (well 99.999% as we've seen in the case of ETH-Classy vs ETH) agrees.
@_date: 2016-09-30 10:03:57
So what will happen? Will DB survive *or* will they go under. If there's no bailout, there's less incentive to just let it die.
So it won't die. They know it's game-over for them personally if they let it die.

Nope, dollars are not given out by the govt. but by the FED. And in the EU by the ECB, also not part of Govt. - But that's a whole other discussion.
Holding dollars is no counterparty risk because 1 dollar = 1 dollar legal tender. This means it is legal to settle debt and/or taxes with it. Bitcoin has the same issue, but it's only 2 layers deep. You hold BTC, which is worth X USD.
With IOU tokens you own a token (layer 1) that is and IOU (layer 2)(by a centralised party like WoW-Gold, Liberty Dollars or DigiX) that says "pinky promise" we will give the valuable item (layer3) itself - the gold.
At least with bitcoins or ethers you hold the actual stuff.  Bitcoins and Eth are decentralised convertible to other value. IOU-tokens are backed by a company that is holding *ALL* the actual assets.
**Question for you:** Is it smart to store BTC on an exchange. If no; why not?

Oh it's a good gamble all right. It is either a very smart move or could cost them a lot of money wasted on innovation if some other altcoin takes over or the system gets banned like Russia is doing.
But they have enough budget for such a project I guess.
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:10:55
Why? If they would adopt Bitcoin, the tech - (not bitcoins the default currency) they could emit their own Tokens on the blockchain. As much as you want.

USA is leading in dev, nodes, etc. - But China is "trading" the "most" (may be a lot of back and forth volume, because the fee is 0%).
@_date: 2015-04-19 09:22:44
TL;DR - I think they want to make Enterprise grade hardware and software for Bitcoin interaction. Think about SAP integrations, Appliances, ASIC hardware (not mining..) for "Internet of things" stuff like that.
Warning: Speculation.

For a $5k amount you might want to have a secure platform. Get like a $50 old laptop with Ubuntu and Bitcoin core (backup the wallet to a newly bought USB stick). Or you can get a Trezor wallet (90$).
Stay safe.
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:47:19
There is no fault. The blockchain did what it was told. 
But BitGo did make a shitty script tbh.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:30:15
TL;DR - It's ok. Have you actually read it? The keys are entered in a random sequence (the display tells you what sequence) hence - it's a protected sufficiently for you to move them after the restore to a new account, with a new seed.
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:29:03
Thanks this is helpful. So the seed itself is a true HD representation of the privkeys, the Card is just a paired 2FA token for the ledger unit. 
Is there a method so I can re-generate the Card from the QR (code)? Is that software open source?
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:21:19
Some reason I can think of: 
* Obfuscation
* Private key risk-management
* For fun
* As a method of later swapping private keys without breaking up existing holdings, etc.
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:48:02
Interesting. So if I want to mess with the system I script bots that try to vote their bot-friends to the top and keep up the charade for a few weeks. Does not cost my anything because I can spawn as much nodes as I want, right? 100s, 1000s of 10k+ bots using Docker or Amazon EC2?
When I reach 80% or more I start messing up the blocks. Depending on who decides to kick me out (the "fire" part) this is a pretty good attack vector.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:31:25
The fact they took all that time to ban something so "small" and "unimportant" actually legitimises it a bit. I thought Bitcoin would be hardly a blip on the radar. Guess I was wrong.
If Bitcoin gets banned might as well be in Russia. Too bad for the Russians though, missing out on the next-big-thing.

But still physical access. Could also tap into the keyboard when entering the HD seed from keyboard.
This is a bit... abstract. I don;t think this breaks the reason to use a Trezor. But I'm on my TI-89 now so I'm good.

Above $500? Get a hardware wallet like Ledger. Or a Trezor maybe (a bit more expensive).
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:37:31
Very cool, this means any feature phone could host a Bitcoin wallet. SMS is broad enough to send out a tx (in blocks) so this would work on any phone, almost anywhere on earth.
PS: Even an iPhone can run these Sim apps. Goto Settings&gt;Phone&gt;Simapps.
It's a relic from the past, but could really give Bitcoin a boost.
...but does it work? Do they have a working demo?

Awesome proof-of-concept!. I thought about my old TI doing Bitcoin stuff when I found it in a closet a few weeks ago. Thought it would be impossible because of the limitied RAM.
Very  very cool. The nice thing about this is that it's colder than almost any wallet, including paper (it never touches a NSA backdoored PC related device even when generating).
* The RNG is improbable to be weak.
* The RNG is impossible to be backdoored.
* Privkey never enters a networked system.
* Privkey cannot linger in memory or hardisk (there's none).
* Very obscure.
Someone should make a Diceware ASIC. And add QR codes.... I'd pay for that actually.

It does. If you restore the seed you type it in.
@_date: 2015-04-13 07:27:01


If you do risk assessment, I'd say the *Chance* of some hacker catching your private key from your SMS/Dropbox is Low but the Impact/Severity is very High. So the risk is high-ish.


I don't think there are numbers available on that. But if your key is in plain sight somewhere, and that data is leaked at one point in time in the future, you can be sure some bot will swipe the key.
There are already bots out there generating Brainwallets of lyrics/movies/quotes all the time, if you use one of those keys they swipe the balance. I'd not be amazed if there are privkey scanning bots monitoring all publicly and semi-publicly available "big data" datastores.

Risk management. Banks have to comply to regulations and their system automaticly flags you and makes the decision if you are an "risky asset".

Fools are being parted with their money. Crypto has failed. Bitcoin and Litecoin have declined tremendously. There is no way, not in a hundred years, that any of those currencies will rise again.
Consider yourself lucky if Bitcoin hits $400 within 10 years or Litecoin $5 within the same time period.
Companies investing in bitcoin doesn't mean shit. They have been investing for 2 years, and the price has been going down for what, 18 - 24 months? LOL!
It's better if you sell now. At least you'll still get something. In a few weeks time, it will be sub $100.
The only reason bitcoin/litecoin went up so much was because of MtGox + China hype. Both are over/gone, so the currencies are dying.

Mmm not my cup of tea, but here's some advice:
Setup a secure wallet at "home" (where you do not work). I'd suggest getting a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. They're around $50 and $100 but very secure.
You can setup a receiving address on your phone (just make a picture of the QR code of your Trezor) so you don't even have to worry about theft/mugging. You simply won't be able to re-spend the coins unless at home.
You could also print a lot of home-generatoed trezor QR codes in advance. It would be better for privacy not to re-use 1 address because of privacy. Just let them send the coins to the QR, check your own phone (if coins landed on your phone) and if so.. do your... uhm.... business-thingy.

Imho, Third worlders don't need Bitcoin. They have other problems to deal with first. Just because a TW country generic user can't use tech does not mean it's worthless. Tesla..? Oculus rift...?
Diceware was tongue in cheek. But multisig is good tech - co-sign services etc are already in production. there's no need to understand just like a facebook user does not understand Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP, PHP, HTML and CSS.


There's not need for a computer.

Bitcoin does not run on "the web" (browser). It's a raw protocol.
It's very resilient. If a Govt. would try to ban the usage by putting up restrictions on the Internet - it only takes a single connection to the country to "leak" the blockchain in. It also works over sat. internet, phonelines and could even function over Fax or SMS.

If Whatsapp does not allow native Bitcoin transactions, one can ask if there is a way send it over the communications channel. 
Whatsapp allows for JPEG to be send. One could make a secondary app that generates an "1-time-Payment" - a JPEG with a swipe-able privkey or something - for the recipient to swipe with his wallet. Also paste a link to a Blockchain.info type of website that either say that the privkeys as been swiped yes or no. So the sender/recipient know if the counterparty swiped the key or not.
Looking like this
    ******* Incoming Bitcoin transaction! ***************
    *              Value: 0.1 BTC - $22,23              *
    *                    &lt;&lt;QR CODE&gt;&gt;                    *
    *                                                   *
    *      Import this invoice to your wallet           *
    *****************************************************
All you need to tell the recipient is  to install a wallet (like Breadwallet) that would allow for the photoroll or image store to be scanned for Invoices (privatekeys with a pincode BIP038?). Could even be Multisig so the receiver needs to verify with a 3rd party "Whatsapp Bitcoin Transaction Broker" to verify.
Whatsapp API does allow URL's to be send. 
Nothing is stopping someone from making a Bitcoin-payment-Invoice-system. Like the way Coinapult.com does it.

I'm not so sure if this is a good idea. I'm not from the US so I don't really care about what kind of president you people vote into power, but hear me out.
The problem with him accepting/mentioning Bitcoin at all is that the "powers" that counter him (the other candidates) have very easy leverage to link Bitcoin to him and/or his (in their eyes) bad agenda.
Like Satoshi once said: *"They [WikiLeaks in this quote] has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us."*
It's rather easy to make Rand Paul look bad by badmouthing him for accepting and taking part in Bitcoin - Bitcoin already has a bad reputation in the media.

It should be open source, very very small ISO and limited to the feature required. No fancy video, framebuffer - just raw console (maybe ncurses) and a proper way to generate a good random seed. Maybe let the user flip a coin a few times to add some random. Also, no networking should be available (disable in kernel). so that it's impossible to leak a key. Also don't mount any local disk or floppy or USB stick.
If Ledger had that - it would take away the argument for offline generation of the Trezor key because such an ISO would functionally do the same job. For 1/3rd of the money.
You could call it "Ledger Secure Management OS" or something like that. Also useful for firmware upgrades, etc.

I've changed my mind on this. I really think 1MB is too big o a cap right now, it creates abuse and gives spammers  a way to mess about.
BUT!!! - It should grow naturally with its usage. If we suddenly see a 3x increase in legit. adoption it should grow, and outgrow, the 1MB size.
The fact that community cannot get concensus yet seems a red flag for any large change or fork. 
Bitcoin is made as digital Gold. We're all in a resource war - let's keep it valuable shall we?

I partially agree. But it's like frictionless diamonds that can be transported over the internet in a few minutes.
I've come to the opinion Bitcoin is a proof-of-concept that has *some* real world usage at this moment because it has not died a horrible death. It's hard to change *because* of the concensus mechanism and that is why it will not adapt to needed changes quickly enough.


Bitcoin is not made for the offline world. It's way easier to use cash (more anonymous, faster even (no confirmations) and easy to use).
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:14:17
The point they are making is;
* Code can be stored on a decentralised platform
* It cannot be deleted
The way it works; they send a custom made .exe in a link/zip via mail. The stupid user clicks the exe (yes, this happens a lot). The AV does not recognize the exe as a virus because it's custom. The "loader", as its called, downloads the payload from the blockchain and runs the rest of the virus.

I did this. Send it to 2 nodes at once. One had larger fee than the other (the address "in my control" had more fee, so I thought it would propagete better).
Did not work. The first one got mined.
There are not many items to not allow the merchant to watch the transactions for a while. Only with video on demand maybe. A webshop with daily shipping could weight like 1 or 2 blocks (very secure already imho) *and* monitor for double spends (that is what bitpay does).

TL;DR - sending someone a BIP038 private key that holds X amount of coins if the fastest, if the person receiving trusts the person sending, that is. It's *instant* the receiver can swipe the balance and sit back &amp; relax. 
There's one thing though - the sender could also try to out-run the next block(s). But that tx would not get relayed on the memorypool. Go ahead, try it. I did. I could not get a transaction to be mined even if the first was fee-less and the second had a massive fee.

Cool. Does not really help against any NSA backdoor, but does solve the need to trust the RNG software/hardware.
Get proper casino dice (the irony!) to get a proper seed though, for maximum tinfoil-hatiness.

That is what AML/KYC dictates. Banks do this too. If they don't they end up like Charlie Shrem.
Don't use Coinbase as a spending wallet and there's no need for you to give up "reasons". Buy BTC, move to your own wallet. Done.

Here's a few things about that
* Almost no-one knows what Bitcoin is, or even wants it
* Some govt-backed version might come along for them to want
* The ecosystem is not ready for such mass-adoption. We still need to hardfork beyond the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:23:04
CTF? You mean fishing? (I'm not familiar with the term).
Quite easy to fix: Coinbase should stop communicating through email. Banks don't do that as well - only give you a notice "There's a message for you". No link - Just let the user login the coinbase.com (with https) site. himself.

Yep. I dont use AWS for this reason. It's like playing russian roulette with your financial integrity. 
You would think there would be this feature:

But nope.

@_date: 2015-04-10 12:10:05
Method  of killing BTC: Tax it to death.
* Buy BTC? Pay Tax.
* Spend BTC? Pay Tax, and tax over the BTC in tax (yo dog, I heard..).
* Remaining BTC goes to change address: Tax it again
* Tax the miner fee as well
* *Tax all the things!*
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:08:26
ok so 
* Bitcoins become close to 0 in value.
* Bitcoin blockchain is no longer mined, because why would a miner waste Kwh without reward. Or fee.
* Bitcoin blockchain is now prone to be attacked.
* ............?
* Profit.

You keep the device offline (like a Trezor or ... lol, a TI-89 calculator) and do the signing offline as well. The HD seed is unencrypted anyway...

When restoring, yes. But a new wallet's keys never touches the computer.
Also, it does this trick:


During the TREZOR recovery process you are asked to enter your recovery seed into the computer with the words in a random order. By default, the TREZOR uses a 24 word recovery seed.


@_date: 2015-09-08 08:01:17

@_date: 2015-04-07 16:48:26
No terrible. Electricity is the fuel to Bitcoin. bitcoins are the incentive token to mutate the blockchain.
Mining block reward is a bootstrapping method - you need electricity (the most elegant form of power) to obtain &amp; secure it at the same time.

$0.10 is still not a goldmine. 7 cent could be profitable if the diff does not go crazy (bitcoinbrothers.de is going live soon, spoke to them at a IT fair - they are making a next-gen ASIC) - where do you live? ND?


Overclocking voids warranty. I had 3 out of 15 S4's break with a very mild overclock. Not smart to do because the warranty is pretty important in your ROI business plan. Overclocking is gambling on the machine not dying on you and gambling is not what you do when you run a "business".


I meant that mining rewards will drop over time, further making it hard to ROI or BE.

* Way too much "get rich quick" people on board. Needs a shakeout.
* The trend is still *down* on the weekly candles.
* Wall Street is "on board" - Like everyone wanted. This is what you get, they like to make money, not make us Bitcoiners rich. Better not fight it.
Just think of it this way: If Bitcoin is what "we" say it is, would the wealthy, rich and investment companies let it leave the launchpad without getting on board first? Of course not. They want in at the level the early adopters got in. Shake the tree till all the little monkeys fall out.
I'd say $25 before we see $500. Yes seems insane. But I've seen Bitcoin do much larger swings. Sadly I sold at $1.80-ish and $3 after it got to $26 in 2011.

 in buying drugs on the internet
Not really even. Cash is better - no trace. Bitcoin transactions leave a trace forever on the blockchain. If the dealer is not careful and keeps your address *and* his Bitcoin transactions on some kind of device and gets busted, you are doxxed as well. Bitcoin is very, *very* traceable. So that usecase is not even that good anyway


Not so sure, it's worse than hiding cash under the matras for reasons I explained above. And if you buy/trade it back to USD (unless you do some shady localbtc cash transaction) a record will be kept at the exchanges and you'll get the IRS on your tail very fast.
I think your comment enforces the decline of Bitcoin - It's not even good for what it's mostly used for, it seems.
I still think it's a good method of settling debt, fast. But as a store of value it's not that good.

Right, right. Thanks! 
How difficult would it be to make a message signing option after generations? So that you can verify the privkey is working with the pubkey on a PC.
Like this:
But on the TI. This would prevent that a flipped bit would cause the privkey to be invalid (as a check).
I would be willing to donate to you if someone made this.

Bitcoin looks silly when the price is as it is. *Next big thing guis* - Price has been tanking for 1.5 years. Adoption is stale. Bitcoin is regarded a passing fad and a failure by the "crowd" (although they are wrong).

So 1MB is fine for now, let's just move on and let this discussion rest for a while, shall we please?
1MB is fine. we can always scale up if we REALLY need it. Obviously the concensus is not there now. Maybe later.
Don't get me wrong, I think larger blocks could be needed in the near future, but this needs to be driven by demand.

**Red flag 
Has not been used for 5 years? That means he was mining in 2011.
Back then GPU mining was already a thing. You could not mine 3000 to 5000 with a normale desktop even if it had 2 top notch videocards (and I don't think a 13 yo would be able to buy a 5850 Radeon that was common back in 2011 for $600 or more just for mining).
Even so, 3000 coins? in 2011 with GPU mining? Nahhhh. I remember GPU mining was more like 0.8 dropping to 0.3 mid-2011 per day for a 5850 AMD card. So 3000 coins would be almost a 1.5 years of mining.
**Red flag 
He's talking about putting a desktop drive into a laptop. Uhh, was it 2.5 Inch or 3.5Inch? MOstly desktop have 3.5" drives that don't fit a laptop
**Red flag 
He **tried** mining but was too retarded to get how it worked? He was mining 3000 coins so even if he was solo mining he was at least mining 60 blocks. So he was at least mining... a few months to at least a few weeks non-stop. 
Meh, 3/10 this is fake.

@_date: 2015-04-22 17:30:42
Uh yes you do. If you want to bloat the blockchain you need to make transactions. Have you ever send a TX without fee? It takes forever to confirm (being mined). Fees are mostly 0.00001 BTC/kb.
If someone starts bloating the blockchain with nonsense I'm pretty sure miners will stop mining fee-less txid's alltogether.

I'm a miner myself. Stop lying. An S5 does around 1.1TH and uses 0.5kWh. At $0.15 per kWh you are looking at $30 of profit in coins per month at current diff. If the diff keeps increasing like it does, that $30 will be $28 next month, etc. 
$0.15 per kWh is very cheap, in the EU a rate of $0.29 (with tax) is more reasonable. At that rate you are burning money away. 


Yes it does. I host my miners at a hydro plant and that guy's operation is easy to ROI because of the bulk-advantage he gets. Also: No infrastructure costs because the power is generated locally. 


If you mine at the lowest rate, you are the last to be profitable. After that your miner is a basically a doorstop (like the BFL Jap and first gen Avalon I had. It might be able to sell to a n00b like OP who does not understand mining economics - but that's scamming and I'd rather not scam.


Does not exist. You are either paying, or using someone else his power. Your employer/landlord is going to be pissed if you burn $200 a month for months at end.

My advice would be: If you believe in Bitcoin enough to spend $2k on a miner - you'd only end up with bitcoins, while competing against the Chinese miners.
You'd be better of just buying a few $100 worth of bitcoins - It's a race to the bottom, mining.

Electrum works with Trezor. And there's some code on Trezor github for privkey management. If you are paranoid you could keep that as well and in like 20 years would still be possible to convert the seed to something you can move the coins with.

But we have a long way to go. For example (in EU, NL) for tax deduction of the interest of the loan payments to apply they need to be in euros, and mortgage has to be with a bank that is covered by "deposito garantiestelsel" (insured bank).
If you loan bitcoins and buy a house, you'd not be able to deduct the paid interest from your income, and miss out on thousands of euros per year.
So the (tax) law has a long way to do in adoption

Bitcoin is digital computer-money that is made by a lot of very powerful computers and the people controlling the computers. It's like a real "coin" but you can give it to anyone you want over the internet. Once given it cannot be taken back. You can't create more then the computers allow, and this limit is set to 21 Milllion.
Because a lot of people and computers are part of Bitcoin it's not controlled by 1 person but a lot. So nobody, not even the government or banks can change it very easy.
You can store bitcoins in your own phone or computer. This is called a "wallet". Don't forget to make a copy of your wallet so you don't lose it when your phone is stolen or broken!
Bitcoins can also be sold and bought on the internet. Currently 1 bitcoin is worth about $340. You can buy tiny pieces of a bitcoin, like you can break a candy bar in pieces. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:53:36

What's his source? There are large pools, but my guess is there no single entity that is above 5% of mining power. These pools have control by-proxy - the mining power itself is mostly individual miners. If such a pool starts messing about, miners leave.

And good for them. But they'll just re-invent SWIFT/BIC. Bitcoin will indeed work as a catalyst for banks to innovate.


That's right. It's still in it's infancy. Only in the last 1,5 years has the "industry" (lol) grown to the point that legitimate businesses want to touch it. You're seeing a (no THE) economy grow before your eyes. Might want to take notice of the great potential here.
There's only about 1 million users worldwide is my guess. [source, but let's assume some margin]( But I think there's also little knowledge what Bitcoin actually does/is. Most people only hear the name and have no clue.

Yes. If the EMP was big enough. But Solar flare related EMP's are more in the lower bands and destroy things like powerlines. Also, most consumer electronics have some form of shielding from EMP.
The power of an EMP degrades almost exponentially over distance. I have yet to see any real EMP scenario that destroys your computer/wallet. Except maybe a Pulsar star event that hits one side of the planet. In that case you're dead. Also everything else. Bitcoin would be least of your worries.
..... even so, your wallet could survive if you made a Seed backup on paper like most hardware wallets tell you to do.

Yes. Mostly friends etc - Although I'm very careful not to be annoying about it talking about it all the time etc. The problem I have with explaining: There's Bitcoin (network) and bitcoins (plural, currency) - People hear about bitcoins and you have to explain them (in order to understand the wallet part) what Bitcoin is.


I advise this to newbies (I don't use these all, but ok);
* Daily: Breadwallet / Mycellium - quick, low storage, own privkeys, HD backup
* Semi-cold: Electrum on secure platform (dedicated PC/VM): Lightweight, HD backup.
* Cold: Trezor

Also, anti-virus. The on-access scanner sometimes gets in between bitcoind.exe and the database files, causing strange delays, crashes (and corruption).
No need to let it scan for virusses, because the DB "can't" really have a virus anyway.
On MS SQL and Oracle database servers it's kinda best practice to exclude .edb and other database files from on-access scanning.

Not much, DB won't "crash" because either they won't be bailed out and they will prevent the crash, or they will get bailed out and it will be "fine" (except for the taxpayers).
Can we please stop with this speculation. The damage a DB crash would cause is bigger anything Bitcoin can fix. It's a $50T balance vs a $10B BTC market cap. That's nothing.
As much as I'd like $50k per BTC it won't happen this that. It's a loooooooong way ahead, Bitcoin is still in it's infancy.

How does a public Blockchain do this? With paper voting there's more anonymity imho.


How do cryptographically define 1 voter? How do you prevent sybil attack from a rogue govt? 


Do we really want this?
I don't see why a (real!) blockchain solves the voting problem. Blockchain - as in Bitcoin - is good for value transfer, voting? Not so much. The reason why PoS is broken anyway.
I think something like Apache Kafka is much better suited for this, it's open, has good API's. But it's not a blockchain.
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:35:43


Non-existent addresses don't exist. If the address is valid, there is a matching private key. It's just the question if any human has it, otherwise you'd have to break SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hashing.




there is no way of knowing if someone still has the keys or not.

Impossible. It's like a huge wall with vaults. You never know IF someone exists that can open a door or not. It's not possible to determine if a certain key exists.
If you transfer bitcoins to a paper wallet, and burn the paper wallet. They can never be moved again, but it could also like someone just holding on to his bitcoins forever. Impossible to determine.


It would be possible to hardcode such a thing into the software HOWEVER it won't be accepted by the miners and users of Bitcoin. You'd make 2 versions of Bitcoin, while the newly created blockchain would be "fake" and not worth anything.


This could happen, however unlikely. If it would happen, why do you think it would be a problem?

If the NEED for larger blocks is REAL, it wil be lifted. I was in the big block camp for a while, but it wil just cause Bitcoin to get attacked with fees being as low as today.
What will happen; imho;
* Bitcoin will keep growing
* Being digital gold, the block limit will be reached, and people will need to pay more fees (thus surpressing trolls and "spam"). Yes, downside is that your cup of coffee won't be on Main-net. Unless you want to pay $0.10 fees (estimate).
* There will be a point where the 1MB blocksize is really maxed out, and the fees start rising so much that the Cost To Spam is no longer an issue
* Blocksize will increase at that point.
But, remember, Bitcoin is supposed to be Digital Gold - not some cheap, worthless, bloat,  whore of a point-of-sale blockchain. It's a war about resources, let's not waste it. Bitcoiners should be more like *"Hey, you want to use this perfect system? Gonna cost you, sir. A moderate fee though"*.
Everybody relax. The house isn't on fire (yet). Let's hope sidechains get out of vapour/beta for PoS systems to still work with Bitcoin in the coming years.

They represent the private keys, in a way. If you write it down, it's a 100% method to restore the entire wallet.
Your phone can re-create the private keys using the sentence. This is secure, as long as you don't share or display it to anyone. Best to keep it on paper/metal (offline).

Stuff like CBC is not the same as the feature-set of the Blockchain. CBC is just blocks of encrypted data.
The Bitcoin blockchain does not use encryption, only hashing. And there's the ProofOfWork mining part that prevents sybil attack + the reward system.
I'd say CBC is to Blockchain as a wheel is to a car.

Geh, large fish want a big stash to mess around with. And they want a regulated properly ran NY Exchange because it's less of a hassle in case you get an audit. They'll want at least a few Million USD of bitcoins to start speculating (read: Rape the market). Now, don't think they'll make all of us rich, they won't. These guys have HFT bots, good tooling, dark exchange pools, and really, really, REALLY deep pockets. They'll end up with all the Bitcoins *and* USD. And all the weak-hands and "hodlers" will sell into their walls. And buy back at the top. Twice.

You could build something like Microsoft has been doing for years with SID databases. Or use Ring signatures (around since 2001).
What you are describing is a distributed database that is openly mutateable. Bitcoin (and other blockchain with mining/tokens/pos) are more than that, they are decentralised *and* distributed. Reaching concensus by mining and/or stake. 
Once you start mining you need some kind of reward (fee/block reward, it's a a BLOCKchain after all) or you need a stake concensus and those need a token as well.
And here's one more feature: The tokens are issued on Bitcoin as we we move along, they are not third party like euros or dollars. The economic model behind it is not in control by anyone. They are unique tokens.
Anyway, My point remains: A tokenless blockchain cannot offer the full feature set Bitcoin offers. It's just an IOU chain, consensus will break pretty fast.

This does not look like a normal txn, multiple addresses are used as outputs (17C... etc) and emptied to multiple other addresses (already containing balances). One of these is 1AzpEFyfLMEakCgzkGbWvpsBygMmyyVQmP - it holds a balance up to this point in time.

@_date: 2015-10-08 10:55:04
Well. I had to take over 28 nodes offline that could no longer handle the mempool. Also, I ran out of funds the last few months. I'm sorry to say but they're not coming back.
I burned $400 on Xen hosting/ EC2 and Azure costs in the last year - as a hobby I ran these nodes - but alas. I decided to quit running them. Maybe I'll fire back up about 5 to 10 with larger memspec though.
1 node is remaining, in my shed. That's capped to 5Mbit via QoS though.

Ouch. You could try putting it in a cold room/outside (not freezing). Sometimes it settles the electric components. I've resurrected USB sticks like that. Plug it in when in a cold room (or outside) or otherwise you will get condensation when you bring the 5c drive into a 20c room. Do at own risk.
could you do a

Technically Bitcoin works as designed, so it's not a failure. I agree that there's a lot of stillborn startups in the Bitcoin ecosystem. But *every* business? I'd say the gambling sites, exchanges and maybe remittance services are making good money.

Be very cautious with that. Because Bitcoin-core uses change addresses. That address might contain coins but if you send even 1 bit to someone the entire balance is removed and placed in a new address.

First: **backup wallet.dat**. And check if you've got the seed written down. 
After that I'd suggest uninstalling the old version, installing the new, renaming the wallet, and restore from seed.
If it crashes, start from console and post output here.

I'm not sure banks are obsolete. bitcoin is a method of transferring money over a digital communication channel, and a way to create more of the same token (mining, deflationary).
It does not offer services like banks do - bank guarantees, loans,  interest, cash withdrawals (fiat).
Banks do need to innovate, and Bitcoin *could* be something they'd use but to think that Bitcoin - in place - replaces banks is kinda naive.

Just counting to 2^256 would exhaust the power of the Sun.
Try it, I did. Make a computer program that counts. 1..2...3..4.... up to 2^256. It's a good way to find out that it's impossible.
Because that is what generating every single address known would be, because a private key is just a number between 1 and 2^256 (well kinda).
And that excludes storing private keys, making the public key, etc.

Even if backward time dilation is possible, it would not change our our current timeline. You would change sometime, it would also fork the timeline.


That question does not make sense, a 51% attack needs to be within a few blocks to work. If you went back to day 1 of Bitcoin, you could attack it with a computer or 10.
If you had a working time machine, you could attack Bitcoin like so: Start, travel forward, 30 minutes, from a mined block we call x , write down the nonce that fitted on x, and the time/date it got mined (time z). travel back to time=z-10 seconds - broadcast the empty block. Repeat.
You'd be able to outrace any block, without anyone noticing (it would look like a ghost). but never more than 1 block, because the next nonce still needs mining power to be found (that you don't have). You're kinda using the mining power against itself. You could also travel to x+1 and broadcast there. That would even be weirder the blocks would keep getting mined 1 second apart like magic.
Brilliant. Now all I need is a time machine....

Technically, yes. But it won't happen.
Think a bit like this. What if every atom on earth would have a number (there are around 1.33 x 10^50 atoms on earth) would have a number. Now think of the chance hitting the same number twice.
There are 2^256 (~1.15 × 10^77) private keys. So to hit the same key twice... well....... chances are near 0.
Fun fact is that there are only 2^160 possible addresses - so multiple private keys for the same address. Still, to move coins you need the privkey - hence I state 2^256 bits of security.

Mining costs electricity, the value of a bitcoin is tied to this process because that is the reward the miner gets. The bitcoins have utility value because you can use them to transact money.
That hole itself could indeed have value, if holes in the ground are used as money. 
Money is a human social construct, its the humans who give it value, not some magic law of nature. 
If you start selling bitcoins below the mining costs (for example $10) the miners will buy it from you. Why? Arbitrage. Them mine for $150 so if you sell yours for $10 they can sell of and get ROI faster because you provide the "free" energy.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:21:02

* Money is, according to him, either a scarce metal OR a token given out by Govt. Well - tough luck - that's not the definition of money. Historically there are many forms of decentralised "monies"; like Rai stones and Manillas.
* It was tulip BULBS not tulips. 
But anyway, he's got a strong opinion and I respect that. Just let us play with this Bitcoin thing and see where it brings us.

Shut that disk down ASAP. NTFS is very good recoverable. But you ned to shut that disk down NOW.
The way "overwriting" works is that a new file is created and linked on the folder ("directory file"). The old file might still be intact and marked to be over written
**SHUT IT DOWN NOW** Put it in a USB dock on a 2nd computer (of a friend for example).
And download this  for NTFS. The free version will give you a preview if it can recover. Well worth the money. If you're in the region of EU/Netherlands (Utrecht) I could give you a hand.

Did you write down the seed, as the program instructs you to do when it generates the seed?
I'm afraid you did not, and that was a huge, huge mistake.
* Did you run both wallets on the same username? Was this Linux?  
* Anyway, DON'T use that disk from this point. Shut off the machine, and make a full dump of the entire partition to a file to conserve anything that might not have been overwritten. After that try your luck with undelete tools. 
* What is the type of filesystem? FAT? ext2/3/4? 
* you need to type the seed into the box when it generates, did you maybe copypaste it **and is it still in memory?**

You sign your transaction with your privkey, in a non-reversible way. The public key is exposed and thus blockchain checks if it was valid or not.

Not a very smart idea - using a public ledger that almost eternal (decades). Sure, let's use that to transact criminal transactions. 
* Your criminal partner's busted and *all* the transactions + real names of his partners are leak (with proof in the blockchain)
* Future blockchain analysis/forensics that might reveal you to worry about for the rest of your criminal life. (unlike USD cash).
* Bitcoin's Exit/Entry point are regulated by AML/KYC.
*What could go wrong?*

Yeah, like I said someone knows. And the daytraders were just selling their stash into them. And now they ran out of bitcoins and now the orderbooks are less filled with them.
If the buying is real, and someone is accumulating, the next group to get left behind after the daytraders are the casual traders - they'll sell their coins at $280/$350 levels and start panic buying back at $400 driving it up to $550+. I think that's the level it will crash back to $175

Bitcoin does this. No-one can stop you using the blockchain to transact.


Contradiction to your first point...No, because Govt. is a group of people so this can and will be abused - think long-term like 25 to 200 years. Govt's change, mutate or get taken over (war). Consider... Crimea.


Bitcoin controls itself - the supply is fixed. Some say this is bad, some say good (I'm neutral about this). It's a fact though that it's fixed. If you want inflation: use Dogeoin (it has a bug; infinite coins).


See above. The blockchain itself limits the supply to 21M. 


I don't have any of those.

Instantly verifiable, yes. You wallet will show the balance update in seconds. But it can take a while for the transaction to mined and "set in stone" forever.
I persinally would take a non-mined transaction (called "unconfirmed") at face value from an ATM. It prob. won't scam you because it would go out of business. Up to $200-ish I would be fine personally.

We're in the bootstrapping phase, there needs to be a resource limit on aquiring coins. Bitcoin uses PoW. Yes it uses power, but not even close to the amount that is actually wasted.

I've got a theory that Satoshi made the proof-of-work 0.1 release based on Szabo's idea. But a conceptual "idea" is not an invention.
I can "invent" a Dyson Sphere by explaining what it is, but I cannot make a working one without a huge amount of engineering hurdles. Bitcoin works as designed.
IMF's system was more targeted at systems that were actually launced in Europe: ChipKnip (Chip Wallet). It used a type/form of ring-signatures with a TTL so the chip wallet could be used in a store/restaurant without a "ping" back to the bank. It wasn't used much.

Yes, don't tell anyone or post that info here. It's relevant and dangerous.


Handwritten is best, so good. The seed is not to be typed in to any computer unless recovering. Paper degrades over time, consider etching it into a piece of metal (stainless) or at least seal the paper it in a plastic bag. (there was a guy here once who lost his btc to a flood destroying his paper wallet). Store it somewhere safe (hide it).


Yes, the moment you enter the password in Electrum the wallet is kinda exposed to malware. I suggest running Electrum on a very old shitty laptop with a fresh install of Debian/Ubuntu Linux on it. WOuld cost you $40. 
My final advice solves almost all your problems: Get a ledger wallet. Or a Trezor - even better  imho because of the screen on it allowing for verification of the transactions.

If that address holds bitcoins, it's *less* safe. Because the RIPEMD160 one-way hash function is no longer protecting the public key.

You are comparing the Bitcoin blockchain to Git and CBC. That's totally missing the point, those are not alike at all. There is no decentralised consensus algorithm in neither. There's no signing. There's no P2P features. There's no broadcast system (mempool). And there's no mining or token.

Uh. Or use a real wallet that does not require any signup? Or get a proper HW wallet like a Trezor. If you don't own the Private Keys you **don't** own the bitcoins. Webwallets are terrible, terrible, terrible.


That's actually not that great.  - I'd say use Electrum with Trezor and possibly run your own bitcoind node for the backend if you are really, really paranoid. Tor does not really add anything imho.


Be careful not to make things worse... you could be mixing with stolen coins and end up being wrongly tracked as being involved by the owner (Evo coins for example).

You have to think in 2 terms: There's Bitcoin (the protocol, network and mining power) and bitcoins - the first token on the blockchain - rewarded to miners and used by users of the blockchain as currency.
Now; there is software that uses the Bitcoin (big B) blockchain to emit other currencies. The advantage of this is that the security (measured in Ghash per second of mining power) and the network effect of the technology.
One of these is  - It's very easy to make your own "local currency" on there. It moves and acts like bitcoins (little b) on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Alternatively one could make an altcoin like mathcampbellcoin. This has several disadvantages; You need developers, the network can be destroyed because of a small amount of mining, and the distribution phase is hard.

Only the latest address, and maybe the older ones once per hour in case one makes a payment to them by mistake. You should not re-use addresses because once used the public key is exposed. Also because of privacy concerns.
If you look at Whatsapp - It's a centralised service that does millions of "transactions" each day (pushing out notifications up to 81,000 / second ). I'm pretty confident that the decentralised nature of SPV services make this possible.
Also, I don't think that if Bitcoin would become somewhat mainstream, that daily/micro transactions will be in Main chain. It's acceptable to do them off-chain (like changetip does) and settle daily on Main chain or on a sidechain (once those come around, eta is Soon-ish or Two Weeks).

The matrix is random every time, so useless.
But if you capture both the Trezor screen and log the keystrokes... Oh sure, that might work, but that's not a technical failure. And a rather obscure non-technical attack vector. You can use Multisig on the Trezor now combined with Greenaddress to lessen that threat. Still, an attack can always hit you with a large trout to force you to pay. Alright.
The other concerns are address replacements on the computer side- those are fixed mostly by BIP0070
 
If you hold large amounts (like a business balance) i'd say 2-of-3 multisig with a second offline computer as co-sign is mandatory (and a 3rd backup key in a vault, spread out via Shamir Secret Sharing).

Nope. You pay from you USD/Euro/GBP "card" and are never exposed to the volatility. Even the merchant is not exposed if they use Bitpay. Go sign up, it's pretty cool.


It's not a *payment solution* - It's a digital cash protocol. A payment solution is (for example) Google Wallet using bitcoins in the backend. Or Bitreserve+Bitpay.

Does it matter? A real node could be slower than a pseudo-node even.
* Pseudonode with a real node behind it on a E5 Xeon with SSD storage.
* Real node on a Raspberry pi
The first will react and process faster. They both do what they should. The only metric that this Pseudonode "breaks" is the headcount of actual vanilla nodes.

Yes and like I said we're in early adopter phase. Not a lot of people using it. 
With P2P I meant actualy P2P systems, not P2P transaction through a centrally controlled (corporate) system. Not that Venmo is bad though. 


No, but it's hard to define "Bitcoin has succeeded".
I'l think of a few KPI's myself;
* Bitcoin is used to transfer 0.1% of the world's M1 money supply - About 3 years
* Bitcoin is by transaction volume (measured in USD parity) and IOPS the largest cryptographical and mined blockchain - Now. Will be factor 5 bigger in 1 year.
* Bitcoin is the network with the largest mining power - Now
* Bitcoin's native token (bitcoins) will have a value over $10.000 - About 2 years.
* Bitcoin's cloned into a privately signed (using PoS/Ring sigs) side-chain by at least 1 large ($5B+) bank, while still using the bitcoin token as a scarce asset - About 1 year away.
You can, and may laugh at me if I'm wrong because I don't care being wrong sometimes.

Mining requires ID? Never heard of that. If exchanges ask for ID it's mostly because the country you live in requires ID for trading. If you're in the US, very much so.


Because a very simple brainwallet or restore sentence is going to be swiped in the matter of minutes. Bitcoin requires a very high level of entropy to be secure. It's a public ledger. People are actually brute-forcing sentences from lyrics and movies, and all random strings up to 10-ish characters. If you pick "Hello123" as a brainwallet you will very quickly get your coins stolen.
ELI5: Simple seeds &amp; passwords will get your coins stolen very fast. No more lunch money.

Once Bootstrapping is done (more than 80%~ish is mined) - I'm pretty sure, if Bitcoin succeeds, we just switch to PoS mining (because coins are spread out by that point it would actually work).

Well Bitcoin is in it's bootstrapping phase. Halve the coins still have to be mined, and the market is TINY. Super volatile at this moment (but starting to less, it used to do 50% swings in a day, now it's more like 10% max).
Anyway. What country? Did you check if there is a ATM nearby? Or else localbitcoins - but only with proper rated sellers - it's scam HQ over there sometimes.

Have you read the PDF? It's not some magical laws of physics breaking machine. The privkey is a random 2^256 bit number - reversing the multiple hash functions is not something quantum computing will be able to do afaik.
Even if - I mean you never know what 10,20 years will bring Bitcoin is not "fixed" - the ECDSA can be changed if the need arises - quantum computing is just starting to become reality.
It won't change anything economical, only security. And on the mining issue - Even if quantum computers would be better than ASICS in find a nonce, the diff. would adjust making everything ok again.
I don't really see a problem here.

This would require a) quantum computers able to do so b) be fast enough to pull it off before the block is mined 3+ confirms (making it very, very hard to reverse). 
Also, there is getblocktemplate since a year, making outrunning the tx hard. 
Counterattack: Don't broadcast the transaction to the mempool, but push it over a dark channel to the mining pools of your choice.
Then again, ECDSA breaking won't happen over night - just like most cryptography schemes dont fail at once - they slightly become less safe. Just like multisig was implemented (hardfork) any kind of (quantum safe) algo can be integrated into Bitcoin.

I don't want to discredit them, but after all the scams that have been going on every single company in the Bitcoin space makes my spidersense tingle. Sorry this all reads either as a genius plan, or, more likely, some kind of yet-another-cloud-miner thing.~~

**Edit2:** The company registration checks out, they have actually a product (16nm "3D" ASICS) and it does seem like a huge cloud mining non-standard trasaction fee business plan. They should have made the newsletter less "marketing" more "technical". I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Interesting to say at least.

Bitcoin is the project name of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Core is the name of the original client/server. And the tokens called bitcoins are the transferable native tokens to the blockchain called Bitcoin, that are also rewarded to miners for securing the network itself.
I still don't see how a Blockchain without any form of token (just asset IOU transactions) would work without counterparty risk. There's a reason why e-gold died.

The 1. problem we have now is:
* 1. Someone could "spam" the blockchain by moving coins back &amp; forth to himself, making the network slow down
Bad enough as that is, it does not seem to happen because it will slow down but not break the metrics of the blockchain.
But.............if we remove the 1MB limit this results in two problems:
* 1. Someone could "spam" the blockchain by moving coins back &amp; forth to himself, making the network slow down.
* 2. The blockchain will grow at 100MB+ per 10 minutes, doubling in size in just a few days. (14400MB per day at 100MB/s).

Your coins are on the blockchain, once it catches up they are spendable. You would have been better off using a SPV wallet like Electrum - it does not require the entire blockchain to download.
* Are the coins already send to the address?
* If not can you change the receiving address?
* Did you backup the wallet.dat file? 
* Are you ok with waiting 3 days for it to sync?
There is a way to move the *private keys* out of the wallet and into another wallet so you spend them before bitcoin-qt syncs. This is, however, kinda complex and error prone.
Close down bitcoin-qt, download the bootstrap.dat file 
And place it into the same folder as wallet.dat resides. Start bitcoin-qt. It will sync up very fast.

A double spent is not a real *double* spent, it's un-do-ing a spent a few blocks back.
if Cex.io was 51%+ they could do that, but all the miners (hashing power) would leave them and they would be expelled from the community. Also, it would crash the price a bit - Cex.IO is invested in bitcoins so they would cut themselves.

Yeh, It's possible. Right now PoS would still break because the coins are not spread out enough.. The PoS miners would gain more and more coins and 51% attack becomes possible.
once Bitcoin is bootstrapped enough, PoS mining is proven technolgy (thanks to PoS coins) and the algo can be changed. If we wanted.

I don't think there's even a definition of "A Blockchain". But alright, if we cut away everything from the Bitcoin project like mining, the protocol, and all the rest, well yes you might end up with something that already existed. SHA256 or RIPEMD160 were not created at Bitcoin's birth, but the project heavily depends on it.
Back to the point: A "blockchain" without the feature set of Bitcoin (or Litecoin, or any PoW/PoS blockchain) is not going to work for decentralised settlement or P2P cash/contracts. It's just a ... database.

I personally think so. But now that Bitcoin is as "big" as it is, removing the fee **AND** limit opens a door for abuse. Someone with enough USD can buy 5000 coins, and start filling up each block with transactions up to like 100MB, making the blockchain grow out of control.

@_date: 2015-02-02 14:53:54


Bullshit. The cost of mining (in $) is determined by the power usage and mining rig write-off. 


This makes no sense at all. Do you even understand mining? If I mine at $150 per coin, and you start selling off a batch of $100 coins, I buy them, so do other miners, price reaches equilibrium, I keep mining and sell off at my $150 or higher. Arbitrage. Profit.
Some miners even levg. short the price as to hedge against pricedrops.


This is not entirely true, it's also determined by speculation. Supply (to the exchanges) is not only controlled by miners.
Bitcoins in HODL mode do not count as supply, but they do when they move to the market. Supply is not fixed. The total amount that will be created is.

It's sorta a "Proof Of Person" problem - It can be faked or cracked - and even making copies of real persons (that are not on the site) and try to get trusted by people who are real (and know this person).
Proof-of-person can only be done by a combination of biometrics, secret questions and internet fundamentals (link to IP and/or a blockchain ID) and even then - it can be "fake".
But interesting concept nonetheless. You should put in verification levels.

Sad story. Hope you gave it a place.
Anyway, Whatever you do, do not give the wallet of any password to anyone on Reddit or anywhere. Trust no-one this community is full of scammers.
If you load Electrum it shows 8BTC balance? You could post a screenshot of it (black out the address stuff). Then it seems the wallet does contain a balance. Try this;
* In electrum , there is a little "seed" icon the bottom. Click it. It should give you the *seed* - this **is** the wallet backup. 
* does it show a long string of words? let us know if it does **but don't type it in here, NEVER ever do that. Also don't take a picture of it**
* Does it ask for a password before showing the seed? Yeah - if that is the case your brother set a password on the wallet and you need it. Does he keep a password list or maybe you can try some?
After you confirm if you can see the seed (this means you have access to his bitcoins), come back to us here in public. We'll give you advice on how to secure the coins off his computer. If you want to sell that is also possible.
*EDIT:* Your brother used Electrum - He pretty much did this with a reason. I'm very certain he kept a backup of the seed somewhere in his personal belongings. It looks like 24 random words "car flower computer tree..." etc. If you find that you are also safe. 
Good luck. Don't react to Private messages! Interact in public here.

Says who? Satoshi didn't. Having a non-pruneable blockchain transaction for a cup of coffee seems like a waste of resources.


Who did that?


Is it? Seems pretty successful so far. The development of sidechains however would actually enable microtransactions (via pruneable blockchains etc) though.

A DAC could own the cars. But not in a legal way (yet) because the law is not ready for that. For example: In EU for a car to be road legal it has to pay "road tax" - and for that it needs to be linked to a person or company. A DAC is not a (in legal terms) company if it's not registered as such at the chamber of commerce (and has stakeholders).
@_date: 2015-02-13 11:52:29


Yeah, ok. But Email is not a digital asset. If you have like $1000 worth of bitcoins in a Bitcoin wallet it's a hit or a miss if you mess up. My granny would not understand the concept, let alone addresses, etc.
If you mess up an Email - you send some text to the wrong person. Ok. If you mess up your bitcoins - you actually lose money.
But I agree with what you are saying. I just think it should be *more* easy to mainstream adoption is possible.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:33:01
Yeah, so when you need to settle a debt without the chance of getting scammed you use digital cash. It's one of it's key selling points, not a flaw.
It's in the whitepaper, it's a **digital cash system**. You can't go "back" with cash, can you.
In an age of machines paying machines (internet of things) you need a digital cash system so one can interact and instantly deliver digital goods/services. Having a centralised reversible payment system operated by humans on the backend is not going to work.
Bitcoin is not *made* for buying a cup of coffee. Bitcoin **won't** *replace* Paypal because consumers, in most usecases, are going to need consumer protection and Paypal works better for that purpose. But for instant settlements - Digital programmable cash baby.

$50 won't buy you a miner that will ever make a profit. I'd suggest using some old $50 Core2Duo PC with 1 or 2gb ram or something as a node - that would help the network and the community.

Well, almost no average joe can secure their bitcoins properly at this point in time (even with a Trezor they might mess it up). So his preposed "Fear" is actually a generic concern. If I gave my nanny a BTC wallet on her laptop it would be stolen, lost, hacked, or she would mess up when trying to send somewhere.
Only when we see proper 2FA/Multisig/Hardware services (Like Coinbase teaming up with Trezor and having some warrantee) will mainstream adoption be even *possible* - let alone happen.

21M BTC. It's just a educated guess I think. 
But each BTC is dividable to 1,000,000 "bits".
So there are 21,000,000,000,000 bits in total that can be transferred back/forth. Should be enough. Each bit is made up of 100 satoshi - these are like the "cents".

Not really. Even an Antminer mines only cents a day. Or about 0.0627 BTC per month. So about $0.50 per day, exluding the investment of the power costs. You end up with around a few cents per day profit if you mine for a year.

I'm interested what those companies are. If a company would force me to register at a Bitcoin-whitelist, they lose my business, to be honest.

Ouch. Yeah try to "cold" hack - it has to get really cold! like 10c celcius - or wait a few days even but don't let it get wet.-
If cold does not work - affter that you could try heating it a bit (50c - don't fry it - don't use microwave). Does it get detected at all in /var/log/messages ? Does fdisk see the size of the disk (raw)?
*do this stuff at own risk* - if we are talking a lot of coin you might want to stop here and contact a data recovery company.

After bitcoin pioneered and spread the word of the power of a digital currency that's unaltered by inflation etc. In one swoop, we have a Bitcoin2.0 or DigiDollar probably, that will render all bitcoins useless.
I don't know it's a bother, I just want everyone to use bitcoin that's all hah.
Mmmm so the Govt. forks Bitcoin 1-on-1? With exactly the same properties? Why would it be more valuable? It's just an altcoin, and I don't know why miners would mine it instead of Bitcoin (protecting their own investments).

Cash is easy. You hold it in your pocket. Once you give it to someone else it's gone.
But bitcoins - you need a proper secure wallet, understand backups/HD seeds. Understand receiving addresses, understand privacy usage, understand price movement, etc.
If you think a 70 yo computer-illiterate is going to understand how to secure his bitcoins with the technology that is now available... you are wrong.

Yes. If SHA256 collisions get more easy (not broken) the new miners would boost the diff. up and it would be ok.
SHA256 being totally broken is not really possible, but if it happend, I think that Bitcoin would hardfork . Maybe change mining to SHA256 with some CPU work involved (tiny) so that ASICS are still needed but CPU as well? Or switch to POS.

There is an alternative method if you install Electrum or such a SPV wallet. You can import the privkeys from your wallet and have them ready to spend **BUT** this is dangerous to do if you are not very experienced, do this at your own risk.

I had the same with cloud servers. I was really cynical when the first cloud server platforms came about - and it was kinda new and not always as stable as iron in a rack.

No it hasn't. Third-party exchanges got hacked, not Bitcoin itself. If a Govt. would introduce a GovCoin, this could still happen - if some lazy sysadmin leaves the privatekeys (hotwallet) on a leaky server it will get stolen.

Good question!


Yes, P2Pool and non-standard fee structures (you make a tx, and donate a fee to P2Pool for mining it) - that way, 
Also, understand that most large mining farms are not a single entity - I, for example, mine on Discus fish because it's the most profitable for me. 
Understand that if they would pull something, me and other miners would leave, and they would no longer be "in control" of that hashing power.
Also. Larger mining farms are "owned" by stakeholders in the company.

Alright, that's prob. how it got infected. If IIS is listening on the internet, anyone can connect. If it's not absolutely needed put a firewall between the router and the server (or use Windows firewall to only allow your abroad IP to connect to it).
No firewall = missing basic IT infrastructure security.
Also very important to keep IIS up to date, as well as the ERP application running on it.
PS, sorry to be so direct but You're playing a dangerous game by exposing your business mission critical server like that. What if it gets hacked for real and they steal cust. data or stuff like that?

Yeah, also be careful with malware/virusses. Electrum is great, but on a crappy Windows machine with coin stealing malware it could get ugly. Run proper AV and don't run random .exe stuff - especially on Bitcoin related websites. There are lot of scammers active.
If you start holding any reasonable amount, consider putting the larger part offline in a Trezor or research Paper Wallets for long-term storage.

* Parking damage (Kids and such slamming the doors open against walls, cars, poles, etc.)
* Interior damage (spills, tears, stains, scratches)
* Rim damage (oops, pothole!)
* Tyre damage (hitting curbs)
* Dents, scratches.
* General abuse (driving too fast, hitting speedbumps at 80MPH, etc)
* Insurance costs (your insurance is going to *LOVE* having 100s of different people drive around - they have a solution for that though - High Insurance Rates™)
* Increased milage decreasing value and decreasing the service interval times. Lowering resale value.
* Liability
* Risk of theft (for parts) - ok not very realistic, still happens sometimes.
You're going to have to walk around each time it is rented and have endless discussions with "users" using your 100k USD car.
No sorry, I'd rather not.

From the birth to the early adopter phase it can take up to 5 years. Bitcoin is not ready-made software. It's a protocol/infrastructure. Heck, the Core reference client is clunky (but stable). Totally not a consumer product so not comparable to it.
I'd say Bitcoin is a bit at the level of smartphone usage in 2004. Hardly present, "I need my cellphone to be able to call" phase. Will take years.


True. Avg. Joe has little need for Bitcoin at this moment. It's hard to get  bitcoins anyway (now). Used to be harder though.


It's not black/white. There's certain features about digital P2P cash that are better/worse vs traditional banking systems.


Depends on the "success" factor. If you give me some measureable KPI's (at least 5) I could tie a date to it (as a personal predection).

This. The privkey is unknown, but so is the pubkey - as long as you don't spent from the address. Normal usage (like in the whitepaper) does not re-use addresses so the pubkey is unknown.

Good question.
Would you keep a wallet open 24/7? I think most wallets would be mobile, and could rely on a "push" mechanism for incoming payments instead of a "pull" (poll) like Electrum does.

The steal the keys of ownership of a set of tokens on the blockchain called a bitcoin (or a part of a bitcoin like 0.2btc).

The EU also enforced the EU Data Protection Regulation since Jan. 2016. This boils down to: If you (as a company) leak out any private information (name, phonenumber, car colour, anything that can be linked to a person) you are bound by the law to report this to the local "watchdog" (govt org.) and if the leak is big enough - pay a fine and inform the person that the leak has occured. There's even a "per person fine" you have to pay to the watchdog (a few euros per person leaked). and another bigger fine up to a 100M Euros 
Now, what OP linked is totally going to break. A central database with names linked to money? what could go wrong.

I'm not sure. Depends if the wallet supports the splitting and anti-replay stuff. In Trezor wallet they will indeed appear on a different "tab".
Some exchanges like Kraken.io will fund you the tokens, also magically appear.  I have not researched other wallets except maybe Jaxx. It says:




If you have any other wallet where you own the private keys (Electrum, Core, Blockchain.info, etc) you technically have the keys to move the supposed BCC, but it might take days/weeks before they support it.

I'm not saying they won't use bitcoins, it just makes so less sense. When you start paying people with a private key, why would it not be stolen (on purpose or not) later along the way? Digital internet cash makes little sense offline. Gold/USD/barter makes more sense.

Welcome! You could start with a good book like 
**Oreilly - Mastering Bitcoin**
Github, for free: 
**The age of Crypto Currency**
To get you started; Bitcoin is not "money" alone. It's a digital consensus system, with bitcoins (little b) being the one of the first applications. You could also start with the whitepaper PDF on Bitcoin.org - It's essentially the blueprint for the Blockchain (Bitcoin - Big B).
Good luck! 
Here's some bits to play with without the risk of losing real amounts of money:
1000 bits

I think it would be a good idea for an exchange (like Coinbase, Gemini) to partner up with Trezor and release corporate branded (with logo and all) (verifiable serial number maybe even) open source Trezor variant.
This would be extremely good for consumer protection, they could host the backend (like mytrezor) on the exchange and even do Multisig for extra protection.
Good idea?

Not true. There are SPV wallets. It's in the whitepaper even.


Not true, this is what Satoshi said:

Tax... Depends on what country you are in. IN the USA for instance you might want to get a lawyer to check if you have to pay capital gains.
In other countries like EU sometimes there is capital gains, sometimes not (only tax on holdings above 23k euro for example in the netherlands).

Looked this up. A380 has 4x Trent 900 engines. One engine has these specs:
    Performance: Maximum thrust: 344–357 kN
That's a lot of force, but alas not power, so can't do math with that.
Then I found 


Ok, so an Airbus A380 does 670 kW **per blade**. It was 70 blades so 46.9 mW. Cool, so one engine outputs about 50% of 1 small nuclear powerplant's output. [source](
* Right now the Bitcoin network is at 3,406,695,505 GH/s (
* Let's take a avg. miner's power to hashrate ratio. The Antminer S9 does about 12TH/s at about 1127W.
* Let's say 10TH a 1000W. For simplicity.
* So the network is 3,406,695TH / 10TH = 340,669 Antminer S9's @ 1000W each = 340,669,000W  = 340,669 kW
1 Trent 900 engine is 46,900 kW  - the Bitcoin network is using about ~~341kW~~ 340,669 kW.
Myth ~~**CONFIRMED**~~ **BUSTED**  ~~Bitcoin network is a single Trent 900 engine at 1.37%~~ Bitcoin is about 8x a A380 Trent 900 engine. Given that an A380 has 4 engines. It' *two* A380s.
PS TIL: Trent 900 engines are INSANE.
**EDIT:** Math, how do I even... off by factor 1000.

Not very, Bitcoins never really "disappear" but it is possible a virus changes your address after you paste, or if you make a typo.
Did you write down the recovery card on your ledger? pretty secure.


ledger=your control. exchange=not your control.


Markets are getting bigger and bigger. Selling $1 million worth these days seems to hardly dent it.
1 million BTC? if you'd sell that the market would crash. google: "market depth"

Almost impossible. Back in 2013/14 maybe 2015 it was *possible*, now... no. Research Bitcoin ASICS - those are the new kind of miners, they blow GPU miners out of the water like GPU blew CPU mining out of the water.

Mining is not worth is, unless you have really cheap electricity. The network has just "halved" - meaning the reward has dropped 50% - if you want to help Bitcoin run a full node on a prope network connection, this helps the network really well.
Sorry, mining is no longer profitable for the "little man". Here's some free bits though.

the miners would get rich off off the fees, and eventually either the blockchain hardforks (low chance) - lightning starts working (outbidding the govt) - or everone flocks to an altcoin (god forbid).
 
They would however need a lot of *bitcoins* to spam the network, not money. You can't make a tx with USD so they would have to keep buying bitcoins on the exchanges etc. to keep the spamming going.
THus driving up the price.

Mmm for that amount of money I'd ask a tax-consultant what to do. Maybe you're already have to pay? or maybe only when converting to USD. I'm not a lawyer, so this is not legal advice.
Pay tax, enjoy the profits instead of living the fear of tax fraud and jail. In my opinion.

I'm not into P2Pool that deep. Maybe someone else can either confirm or deny this. 


Not really. Every miner gets paid percentage-wise. Let's say a pool is made up from 100 miners with the same hashrate but 20 users. You own 2 miners you get 2% of the block reward. You own 50 miners you get 50%. Why would that drive out the small "guy"? The cost is linear.

@_date: 2015-02-14 13:24:05
Yeah, well.... I run full nodes that have ISCSI disks as volume. The disks run on a cluster disk-array that has its disk over 300km away sometimes. It's part of my own company's infrastructure.
Is that a full node? Yes. But the server itself is not in the same place as the hardware (disks). Does it matter? Not really. Same with your proxy-node. It's actually a good implementation to run a node in a location that has expensive disk/memory storage.
Nice project! This will strengthen the network. It's a good way to "hide" real full nodes against Ddos. Thanks for making this. I'll try to setup a few of these proxy nodes and make them connect to a NATted node and see if that works well.

My personal opinion/method: I'd take a $100 0-confirm with enough fee just fine. Above $500 i'd wait for 1 confirm.
In case of a fee-less transaction: 2 confirms at least.

trezor can do Ether, but ether-tokens like Sia.. I don't think so




The private keys - aka the means to spend it - are not on your computer but secured by hardware.


You're fine, the phone is locked right




If the wallet is like Jaxx or Breadwallet you'll get a recovery seed (12 or 24 words) that can bring back your coins on a new device.
