Computer crash, harde drive toasted. BOOM. Money gone. 


I am not afraid of a market crash because I haven't invested much. But people using bitcoins for their pensions / mortgage? Damn, those people really really put their LIFE in the hands of an utterly unstable coin. Are you currently putting your life savings in bitcoins? Are you willing to take that risk?
Ofcourse there are people making stupid investments all the time, but are you willing to take such a HUGE risk with such an unstable crypotocurrency?

My apologies, I thought you were talking about local Wallets like Bitcoin-QT. You are right that people overinvest, regarding bitcoins or basically any other investment. 
The reason I started this post is because after using bitcoins for a few months now, not everything seems as easy, safe and good as it sometimes is said to be. I still am insecure about some aspects of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and am seeking information about it. Hopefully this post gets a solid discussion going. Try and be nice, internet stranger ;-)

Sounds super easy :&gt;
About your comment regarding speed, I have a creditcard but hardly ever use it (im from The Netherlands where paying with creditcards happens way less then for example the USA). Pretty much everyone pays via bank transfers. Yeeaaars ago you had to do this by mail, now you just enter the bankaccount# and the amount you will pay, and boom, done. Takes a millisecond.

Exactly my point. There still is a tech hurdle. Everybody says how easy and simple it is, but in my opinion it really isnt. Don´t forget that if you have large amounts of bitcoins, you need to spread your money, make regular backups, really make sure your pc isn´t infected AND you need to place your trust in others. It might get better later, but at *this* moment, (atleast for me) it isn´t.

Sorry newbie question here, but why should I back-up my wallet from for example blockchain.info to dropbox? I.e; from one internet service to the other?
Can I upload my wallet from dropbox to another e-wallet incase my blockchain account gets hacked?

Are you sure about that? I don't think anyone can tell at this moment what banks will do. They might change and be more open to bitcoins, but just like every other major change in an industrie, that shit isn't adopted easy. Just look at the video / music industry regarding illegal downloading. It is only JUST getting better. The way I see it, a lot of the money-business will change IF bitcoins get more adopted worldwide. And I mean that this will most likely be negative changes for bankers, brokers, insurers etc.

If I understand things correctly, there is a fixed amount of bitcoins. Not all bitcoins have been "mined" yet. The value of a bitcoin keeps rising because of supply and demand. However what will happen when the last bitcoin is mined?
Will the algorithm be expanded so that more bitcoins become available? Doesn't that entirely delute the idea of bitcoins?
Sorry for the stupid question but I never really got this.
