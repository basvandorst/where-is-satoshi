They should create a blockchain to do their spell checking. That would definitely get my voite.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:55:38
They're both valid for that private key, as there are two methods to derive a public key and address from a private key. The important part is that you use one that is supported by your wallet. Modern wallets usually default to the compressed version because it results in slightly smaller transaction sizes.
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:37:26
They're mostly scams, so no.
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:38:52
What a stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:27:18
Thanks again :)
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:16:11
I was extremely surprised that it hasn't been taken yet. 8 minutes is a long time.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:14:26
He has become so accustomed to being a stupid pumper from all his altcoin pumping that he doesn't even notice it anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:48:34
@_date: 2017-02-06 01:32:23
Gotta pump them altz dude.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:47:08
It's all about THE blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:34:53
What is that supposes to achieve? Sounds like bogus advice.
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:18:16
Probably quoted someone from the trollbox.
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:30:28
Totally not a scam.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:48:12
And now you're an eth scammer. Nice career.
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:32:15
Wow you're really testing me now. But I'm not gonna be that much of an ass...
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:01:45
Hasn't dark wallet been dead for a long time now?
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:20:35
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:27:11
Why is it so important for you to stay neutral in this? Fuck the narrative that vilifies developers for writing code. We shouldn't pay any attention to their divisive tactics.
edit: I just read your reply to vroomDotClub and how the idea behind UASF is users championing it. Fair enough. But you're a user too, right?
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:38:44
It's pointless. It's another way to exploit the altcoin pump markets, that's about it. Good for Erik though.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:09:46
By BU economic code he is referring to pumping his altcoins, right?
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:30:19
Nothing. Because you know, there is no such thing as spam, all transactions are equal.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:22:07
They can fork themselves out of Bitcoin anytime for all I care.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:10:19
Are sidechains even real? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:42:01
Do I have to pay them a fee to get my node registered as a ctitical node?
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:12:31
I feel the same way about your comment.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:49:54
UASF would actually convince me to start running a node again.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:39:56
Eh, they'd just find a part in the white paper that can somehow be misinterpreted as Satoshi saying that it's okay to murder people. Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:31:41
I think the real emergent consensus here is that emergent consensus is crap.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:13:15
I thought Gemini started accepting zero conf transactions a while ago? Maybe contact their support.
Or more likely you're just one of the many alarmist flooding this sub with made up stories about stuck transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:51:14
Don't worry, emergent consensus will fix it. It will fix everything. Just let it emerge! 
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:53:20
I really don't see this as an important story for Bitcoin. And alts are *your* bread and butter after all, so it's not surprising that you in turn tend to vilify what you like to call "bitcoin maximalists", in the usual pejorative manner. This news is simply not very relevant for anyone other than yourself, and it is in fact nothing but an ad for your altcoin exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:55:11
It's disgusting how they take Bitcoin and what the devs have done for it over so many years for granted. Bitcoin is feeding their mouths (and buying their lambos). If they stay ignorant like this they deserve to lose it all.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:49:53
I'm shocked! Who would have thought that Roger Ver would do such a thing? Is it the same company that's helping him pump his stupid altcoins?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:12:06
Spelling it as AstroTurf is definitely confusing. It's a verb.
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:54:57
This is making me kind of sad now. So much effort, so much work, so many extremely smart people putting their heads together, and then the miners are like nope, sorry, fuck your solution, we like this amateur shitshow by Ver better. Goddamnit.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:12:52
Times were good back when Gavin still made sense. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:51:47
Sometimes it's necessary to call a spade a spade. And all terrorists believe that they're acting in their own best interests, whatever those interests might be. The devs have done an incredible amount of work already, and come up with a great scaling solution. It's not their job to now also negotiate with a bunch of malicious miners (which is mostly one person anyway).
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:29:51
Alright. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:11:18
At least they're not blockstream core blocking the stream with their politburo central planning turning bitcoin into Myspace with invisible walls when the bus is full and substitute goods are stealing market dominance which goes against everything Satoshi ever said because proof of work means miners are bitcoin and Roger Ver is much more handsome than Adam Back too!
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:40:20
The miners are getting the fairest deal of all. They plug in an asic and get money. That's all they are doing. They aren't entitled to anything, and certainly not to special care and attention from a group of some of the brightest people on this planet. The devs absolutely have better things to do than pamper that spoiled brat Jihan. He can go fk off. And the sooner the better.
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:13:14
Thanks! The one time I check new on But why are you giving away free money? Now I feel kinda bad for just taking it like that. But then again, there's no confirmations yet, so...
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:19:30
And now some jerk like myself got it. I'll try doing some good with it, but I can't promise anything.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:53:22
No. They're too incompetent to do anything right anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:01:46
Good for you. I only have two questions though: why is this at the top of and why should I care? It's just your personal little story, or am I missing something? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:28:50
Just don't show this to Gavin please.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:05:01
More likely from people experimenting with manually generating bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:41:59
You can try this 
You'll probably have to keep trying because they only accept a limited number of transactions per hour.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:28:50
"Stop asking so many questions and give me your moneys already!"
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:56:15
What a pathetic reply.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:26:29
Nice. Btw can armory do compressed addresses now? Last time I tried it couldn't, which would suck because of inflating transaction sizes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:28:04
Wow did he really take a break from pumping dash to make that reddit post? What a waste if valuable pump time.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:39:42
You can't negotiate with terrorists. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:30:13
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:32:31
Okay, thanks for the etymological clarification.
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:50:15
The real MVP.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:15:21
lol nice title to get upvotes. I still downvoted though. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:43:38
Any wallet is safe. You're not losing your bitcoins because of a fork ever. If you want to be really safe, use the bitcoin core wallet (means you have to dl the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:46:41
Speak to your mother if you want speak!
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:53:00
Astroturf is not a company name...
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:41:55
Let's be honest here. You deleted it because you realized that it could lead to repercussions, because you know exactly who you're dealing with here. But at this point it would only result in a Streisand Effect for our dear Roger, so you're probably safe.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:25:04
Because your title is intentionally worded to elicit upvotes. I'm just contrarian like that. Also I think Shapeshift is stupid. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:19:35
Honestly, I want nothing to do with the people from I want them to fork, give me cheap coins for a week or two, and then be gone. Forever.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:38:12
After the difficulty adjustment, and assuming the price stays high enough, yes.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:16:32
I used to think you're an idiot, now I think you're one the most lucid people in Bitcoin. I just wanted to tell you that.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:21:48
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:15:56
What about global warming though? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:42:53
OP doesn't care, just another stupid alt pump post. How the fuck did this shit make it to the frontpage here?
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:43:24
Sorry, maybe my hearing just isn't as good. It was very tiring for me to listen to.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:13:24
Couldn't we do eth style smart contracts with counterparty already?
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:51:36
Please do these in settings that don't have so much noise. It's very tiring to listen to bad audio like that for over an hour. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 12:00:14
2014/2015 really has shown who was in it for the right reasons, and who just wanted to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:31:17
Complete FUD.
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:59:45
Why would a hacker withdraw several times over multiple days instead of everything at once? Makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:58:23
Shamelessly stolen from the frontpage :)
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:35:45
Wait, didn't the CEO die of a drug overdose after bitcoin went bankrupt?
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:02:05
You could give Mycelium local trader a try.
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:15:08
Lol. Downvoters here have no sense of humour. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:51:53
Must be nice to be able to make $13 million rounding errors. Hey maybe if bitcoin goes to $100 million I can do that too.
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:51:20
Lol. Telling mom to buy bitcoins on leverage. This can't be real... who would do such a thing? Nice trolling.
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:01:32
They did the math, but the math was wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:13:19
Write it down? Make multiple backups? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:26:06
Had nothing left in there, thanks a lot for the disappointment. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:48:11
That is true. Maybe it will get better over time, but definitely not by integrating shitcoins and alienating the hardcore bitcoin supporters who probably make up the core user base of it for now.
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:36:38
It's funny how much less I care about these projects the moment they start integrating shitcoins. Wouldn't surprise me if the number of people who feel the same is bigger than the number of people who will ever actually use any shitcoins on OB.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:45:19
Why do you assume he needs that? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:05:22
The price actually going up on this news is probably the biggest fuck you to Allaire possible.
@_date: 2016-12-06 12:30:25
Coinbase is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:18:53
That really depends on your personal situation. If you don't have many financial obligations and you can just keep holding no matter what, then sure why not. If you need that money then probably not such a great idea.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:53:48
Worst Christmas ever!
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:58:16
Let people set their own fees and deduct from the amount? Only works if you're not combining multiple withdrawals into a single transaction of course.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:47:56
Just don't lose all of your backups all at once.
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:31:49

@_date: 2017-04-09 01:40:56
Electrum has RBF too.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:18:38
They probably also sit on chairs, like gox! Oh no wait, Mark used to sit on a bouncy ball. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 13:28:29
The world definitely needs more pointless lists.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:50:00
Good thing posting in doesn't put you on a list yet. Or does it...
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:41:06
Omg you're right. This is so scary!
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:50:02
How is any of this similar to Mtgox? Banks being dicks vs being insolvent. Totally like similar conditions. You people sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:10:31
The fact that you're apparently too afraid to download a perfectly legitimate live CD just because you might end up "on a list" is the real scary part here. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 09:11:31
Lol on a list. These silly scare tactics really work?
If you're scared of being "on a list", just use a VPN. Or does that put you on a list too?
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:32:15
Nah, fuck these guys. Seriously. They're not well intentioned, and there's no point in pretending that they are.
@_date: 2017-04-09 01:47:15
Don't know what a quick numb toggle button is, but yeah it's part of the UI once RBF is enabled in the settings.

@_date: 2017-05-28 11:54:48
Whatever. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:44:23
Maybe your bitcoins are all in the change output of the unconfirmed transaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:53:41
Yeah. But I really don't think there will actually be two chains though.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:07:24
But where can I buy rootstock tokens? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:27:53
Thx wanacry!
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:26:42
But.. but.. what good is this if I can't buy tokens for the puuump?? ;)
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:36:03
You don't need to run a node in that case, as the relevant node for you will be the one your exchange uses when you're selling.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:04:19
They don't have to support both chains.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:01:35
I mean two tradeable chains.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:21:54


That's ok, there's not enough bitcoins for everyone anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:08:26
Twitter for this? Seems very unprofessional. How about contacting them via their support, privately! Unless of course you want to use it for a cheap publicity stunt...
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:11:46
It would only mean that there wasn't enough pain yet for enough users to force a change. Because fundamentally UASF is a sound concept, if there's enough support behind it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:06:12
Why no full disk encryption on USB sticks?
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:01:26
That subreddit is pretty much nothing but a shillhole these days, and the mods obviously have their own little agendas too. You can also tell how much or how little they're invested in certain altcoins by how tolerant they are of altcoin spam. I only go there for the lulz now.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:43:40
Not really. Exchanges decide what they want to add to their platform. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:23:50
What is a time locked wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:07:00
This feels very fake.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:11:39
Fuck I'm always so confused when I see your username. I'm like what kind of stupid shit is he posting again this time? But it's not stupid at all, so I'm like what the hell is going on? Then I take a second look at your username.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:10:15
Is Bitcoin the new Justin Bieber?
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:33:03


That's a feature not a bug.
