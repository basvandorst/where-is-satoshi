The Fed set up the Nixon Shock by hiding the consequences of fiscal deficits, helping make them normal.  When there was so much money outstanding that France realized it was profitable to call bullshit (over a period of six years), then the game was up, and the dollar had to devalue off $35/toz.
You can see another inflationary influence juicing credit creation in [one of its first actions]( affecting WWI war bonds.  What the Fed did that time was offer a special interest rate for interbank lending when showing war bonds on the balance sheet, which made them very appealing to the banks.  In the Fed's own words, strong bank balance sheets were then used to fuel other lending:

I'm glad we're well past this:


Instead, you have encountered reasoned arguments, that you simply disagree with.  If you are honest with yourself, you will begin to ask why the idea of privacy has persisted with strong support and intentional design through free societies for hundreds of years.  You will begin studying the question, and you will refine your own mindset, rather than merely reacting to what I write.


That's your own straw man.  You brought up the ends-based morality.  I merely linked a reminder that tens of thousands of people died when the system you are defending tipped over.  I'm helping you with information for your "balance between having a comfortable life and doing the right thing".


Yes, yes.  [Trifling mistakes, those.]( [Everything is different from here on out.](  The system is fixed! /s


It is certainly enough (along with your banking income) to convince you that you need not respond to my points about the costs of your actions.
Ahh, but you are a good person, making good decisions, so the machine you help run must have net good effects!  /s


That straw man.  Anyway, if it were about how good you and your people are, I would simply explain to you how good I and my people are, and then we'd be done.
Instead, imagine a good soldier in a bad war.


LOL, what silly goalposts.  Reread this part:


I'm not talking about sanction lists.  Your tracking at a minimum chills speech in the US and Europe, and in (even) more totalitarian societies justifies their tracking as a tool to assist in heavier oppression such as "disappearances".
The key difference between us is the idea that privacy is good.  Government is really bad at finding reasons to offer privacy to people (duh), but it turns out that people are willing to pay for it.  With tens of millions of Americans buying in, there is no way for you to argue that everyone interested is bad.  We also have the US Supreme Court on the side of a fundamental right to privacy.
Good people have reasons to want privacy (even at the cost of bad people getting it), the money demands privacy features in order to be fungible money, there were reasonable tax solutions before income taxes, and there was reasonable policing before computerized bank trails.  Maybe privacy isn't such a big problem.  Oh snap, except for your career!

There is indeed an old fork in the takeover scenario, recognizable by blocks with transactions that went censored in the takeover fork.  Bitcoin is a human idea, not just a few lines of code.  We don't all throw up our hands and go on fiat welfare if this attack happens, but your rinse and repeat idea would make the challenge difficult.
The idea of changing the code to prevent a majority hashpower entity from censoring transactions goes back to [June, 2010](  Old ideas don't mean that they are still the best ideas, but it shows you that Andreas is not pulling answers out of his ass.

A self-dealing attack also requires orphaning blocks from honest miners.  If the attacker does not orphan, then the fake transactions that are raising the fees (in lieu of more obvious non-rational transaction selection) get expensive when an honest miner wins the fees.

* if your node is partitioned, then you will have a clearer signal of blocks not arriving than if difficulty plunges adaptively, making everything look normal again.

A digital signature is signed, but not encrypted.  Anyone can read it, which is not true for encrypted messages.
The miners verify the blocks that they create, but all nodes verify the blocks that they accept.  Miners are not special in the verification process, compared to validating nodes.  You control the rules for the blockchain that you accept.  This is not widely understood, but was proven when UASF defeated S2X.

They're too new to even ask the right question!  Nowhere does that bullshit page mention spinoff.
Use [this example](
*  It's LTCG when you sell, if a sale of the corresponding BTC would be.
* It reduces your cost basis for BTC by an amount TBD by the market (which is exactly what you want, since that minimizes the LTCG basis that you have to pay when you dump the shitcoin).
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:07:11
As the codebases diverge, the shitcoin devs will leave bugs in (like they did with XT, Classic, and BU), risking what little value remains on the chain.  Miners will put less energy in, and hashrate security will fall.  Meanwhile, technical innovations on BTC will keep improving, and miners will merge-mine sidechains that allow further rapid experimentation.  People choosing to do real business will see that there is no technical advantage to BCH, and serious disadvantages.  The BCH exchange price will keep falling, relative to BTC.  Any time an old cache of Bitcoin Days gets Destroyed, the BCH will get dumped as well.
All of this is already shown in the BTCUSD price, which has not fallen.  If the BCHBTC exchange rate was not purely an artifact of artificially constrained supply (soon to be corrected), then its market cap would would have shaved billions of dollars off Bitcoin's market cap.

No.  The cost basis you assign to Bcash is not reasonably 100% of what you paid for your BTC.  The fairest split is a proportion of the BTC+Bcash value in Bcash now, like 10-15%.  
Unfortunately, the flip side of this is that when you declare this, you have to declare your cost basis of BTC 10-15% smaller, meaning you show the IRS more gain on selling BTC.

The BCH chain thinks it's the Bitcoin chain.  Your BCH client reads the same blocks that gave you 1 BTC and it thinks it has 1 BCH.  It is always 1:1, at the time of the split.  People value them differently on the market.
The key format is the same, and it's using the same chain-scanning code.  Only the blocksize code is different, and some anti-replay code to keep transactions from crossing the chains.  Nothing (needs to) change at all in the Bitcoin wallet.  The BCH wallet scans its own chain (which is currently most of the same blocks as the BTC chain), and it does scan the same addresses.

First off, realize that if the cost basis proportions are wrong, then the IRS still gets their money because it simply means gain shifts between the forks.  Taxable gains will come, sooner or later.
Second, the best basis will be subjective, but within the range of what the market believed at any moment.  All of these market ticker values made sense to the parties trading, and in that way are potentially more real then a board's decision.  
Third, IRS would do well to issue guidance for averaging moments of low volatility from the first week or month of trading.  They could even play the board of directors and publish their valuation, if they don't want me playing that part of the game.
BTW, whether or not some Americans play games with the IRS does not change how IRS gets to compute taxes.  Government bodies are screwed up, but they do not have arbitrary powers.  Even the guidance can be tested in court, and must follow precedent.  If games wre played, then unpaid tax liability just adds penalties...

I agree that every wallet should put more effort into helping people get out of spinoff altcoins.  None of the wallets offer all the features I want.
In the meantime, the solution with GreenAddress would be to use the seed words in a wallet that helped you get access to the altcoin.  Since you can restore from seed words with almost every wallet available today, you'll never be completely stuck.
*edit:* With GreenAddress this is somewhat more complicated, since the transactions are (if you accept the default 2fa) stuck in 2of2 multisigs.  Those all have timeouts, as far as I know, so that you can still move your funds at some later date.
*edit2:* I forgot how GreenAddress works.  They use pre-signed transactions for the timeout.  But they couldn't pre-sign anyone's timeout transaction in a way that satisfied Bcash anti-replay, because Bcash hadn't defined that yet.  This means customers can't solve this without GreenAddress's cooperation.  So far, they are not cooperating.

Anything easily detectable can be marked algorithmically.
Fraud proofs regarding the rational (non-censoring) set of transactions that should have been mined can be based on "weak blocks", like p2pool uses.  You don't have to "trust the mempool" for ordering.
Raising the fees too high through self-dealing is deniable, but easily detectable.  Just fork and include some censored transactions, with their lower fees.  When the attacker turns their hashpower on you, they'll just be confirming transactions you wanted to confirm.
It's all cat and mouse.  There are still plenty of mice in the world.

In an environment with high popular demand, dangerous hackers, transaction spamming, and contentious forks, wallets currently need the following features to be reasonable:
* dynamic fee estimation (preferably using 0.15's new algorithm)
* manual fee override
* RBF (for sender to try several low-fee attempts despite a deadline)
* CPFP (for when the receiver wants to help confirm a transaction sent with a low fee)
* SegWit support
* block header monitoring (for general fork awareness)
* direct connection to one or more private bitcoind servers
* Tor support
* Bcash-altcoin sweeping
* (coming soon) Segwit2X-altcoin sweeping
* either secure element support or external hardware wallet support
* message signing support (useful for setting up deals or doing coin voting)
On Android, Electrum is consistently writing good features but places a lot of trust in their servers (although you can point to your own machine).  GreenAddress always has updated safe features (but their 2fa interface is complicated and should be less in your face, since it's optional).  Samourai Wallet promises to keep you off altcoins.
Of the above, only GreenAddress is available on the iPhone.
I used to recommend Mycelium, Breadwallet, and CoPay, but they've all failed important tests above.  Even GreenAddress's optional 2fa is failing some customers trying to extract their Bcash.
I have considered only phone wallets above.  For normal people, phones are more likely to be secure than desktops.  But if you own more than you want to walk around with (secured by the phone's lockscreen and a spending pin), and can secure an offline computer, then you'll end up using either bitcoind or Armory.  Old timers will know that already.  Normal people will buy a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S.
*edit:* name fix

Don't support it, just help your customers sweep it out.  You are in the classic exchange's dilemma: if you do nothing then someone will sue you to get their fork-value out.  At that time, you will realize that coding is way cheaper than lawsuits (even if you could win it), and you will write the code anyway.
Maybe you know enough about the addresses on your service to know how little value could be gathered in a class-action lawsuit.  Maybe you hope that Bcash tanks faster than lawyers can type.  But even then, you don't want to take a controlling stance.  
* You making decisions against new ways people can use their private keys makes you less valuable.  You should always make the decision for user control.
* Preventing Bcash tanking via free-market price signalling helps Bcash.

Thank you for the encouragement to read the Forbes article.
I grant it is possible securities interpretations do not apply at all.  In that case we can use a different viewpoint and observe that it is the *existing private keys* that were affected.  Their *value changed* according to the market.  *No new thing was given*.  No one has more private keys as a result of the fork.
About the article:


The entire article rests on the above quote.  Nothing backs it up.


Bitcoin crashed 10% when Bcash hit the scene at 10% of the value of a bitcoin.  Bigger wheels were in motion, with segwit and with low expectations that Bcash would stay strong, so that changed, but fuck this gaslighting.
Observe closely the main point of the article.  It does not spend the authors' time and energy laying out the case for why their quoted colleague is correct.  Instead, the bulk of the article is about how the IRS is gonna getcha.  This is a FUD piece.
**TL;DR:** Bcash did not give you a new thing and you do not have a taxable event until you sell.  When you do sell and report capital gains, use as the start of your holding period the date you transferred something of value (i.e. when you parted with your dollars), NOT the date that the ways to sell your private keys changed (i.e. August 1st).  Split [the basis]( as necessary, to ensure that you don't use the same outgoing dollars twice in a way that would lessen your gains.

First, get your coins off Coinbase, Inc.  You know that.  
Your question is based on a gold metaphor, and needs a metaphorical answer.  The lump sum of inputs get *re-melted together*, and *then sliced* to the outputs, in every transaction. Even the miner winnings are issued in a lump of 12.5, not individual coins.  
Some people have paid premiums for transactions that come directly off miner winnings (the real coinbase).  They want coins with no other history, for collection purposes.  This is widely regarded as silly.

Satoshi offered better incentive design than you realize.  Yes, they can take physical stuff that you have.  Yes, they can throw you in jail.  But they do a lot more of those things when the loot makes their lives better.  
This moral hazard (instituted in progressive taxation everywhere, but currently heightened in the US due to the War on Some Drugs) goes all the way back to the Spanish Inquisition.  The witches were [in very large part landholders who didn't pay off the church well enough]( and the Catholic Church (surprise surprise) seized infidel assets while nullifying their wills and hereditary succession.  It's hard to turn a society around once it gets lost in a mess like that.  The Spanish Inquisition lasted hundreds of years. 
Now consider how things change if - at great expense to your life but at your option, if you are angry enough at them - they sometimes don't get anything by throwing you in jail.  If a class of revolutionaries are an expense and not a profit center to them, then they should start to think a lot more sensibly about taxing only the titled ownership that the legal system is enabling, and maybe leaving people's labor, speech, and thoughts alone.  
When they let you out then you can spend your coins and create some jobs jobs jobs.

We all thought we had that bull market already.  There was a convincing setup.  But everyone was wrong, and 1,800 bitcoins every day is just too much.  Wait for the halving.  Wait until the market is trying to figure out where 900 bitcoins per day have gone.  Stories from China and from US regulators won't matter so much, then.

We know more than that.  We know which use cases it sucks at, which it is best at, what its potential user experience is, who must be defeated for it to dominate, and what concepts must survive for it to remain relevant.
When you want to move through the checkout line in a few seconds and don't care about 5% hidden fees added by the merchant, a 17% APR to use debt, and months of uncertain settlement, you use a credit card.  So it hasn't displaced the value that credit card companies are extracting.
When you are afraid of securing your keys then you will avoid Bitcoin and use something more traditional, maybe paper cash.  So it hasn't displaced that value.
Most of these microeconomic decisions are being made on the basis of ignorance.  People do not know that Bitcoin offers anything.  Some people have taken a look and instinctively decided to wait for the ecosystem to put a lot more effort into usability.  As the ignorance decreases and usability increases, volatility as a percentage of total value will decrease, and incoming value will more predictably follow the newest use cases that Bitcoin is disrupting.
A very few of us are willing to forecast what the future will bring to these microeconomic decisions, and put our money on it.  Speculation signals move faster than adoption or code reviews, and are very rough.  It's hard to tell how far out ahead the market should look, when it prices bitcoins.  You can tell from the general trend that speculators see, way out there in the future, a kind of money as boring and settled as TCP/IP, with a similar number of users.

You're telling me these things:

* You don't want to switch gears and work on wallet software to improve the ecosystem (which is entirely your option, but don't tell me that contributing to other open source projects is something you don't have control over).
* You don't want to educate people about how to get off shitty wallets.

Because the banking industry operates by kicking other kids out of the neighborhood when they want to set up their own lemonade stands (we call this [regulatory capture]( and Bitcoin makes its own rules in order to provide better service to people who want to keep the fruits of their labor (we call this freedom).
Only a lemonade stand that cannot be removed from the neighborhood --by even the most angry parents-- can show the other kids what a real lemonade stand should look like.  The lemonade tastes better, the kids running it never leave for soccer practice, they trade with you no matter what country your parents came from, and everything is cheaper.  
It is possible that the entire banking industry tries to compete by offering better lemonade and more freedom, instead of calling freedom lemonade naughty, pointless, and hopeless.  That would be unexpected.  In the history of the world, big industries using governments to hold on to their power do not go quietly.
Most of the freedom lemonade kids realize that they're going to need to stand up and fight, but the cool thing is that buying and selling freedom lemonade is most of the fight, as long as you can taste the good stuff.

No, Timothy B. Lee's article does not do a reasonable job at any point.  
It fails in the first sentence, when it calls the CEOs "prominent developers".  There were no developers contributing recent commits to the bitcoin core codebase in that room.  Mike Belshe is not a developer.  
Killing S2X does not prolong capacity problems, but rather allows real developers to get back to real work.  
Fees are not rising to the point of excluding users, but instead some wallets are broken and users don't care enough to migrate to good wallets, because they're happy moving large amounts of value.  [Fees as low as $0.05 are still possible to achieve](The fix for scaling is not easy, because the easy fix (big blocks) kills decentralization.  The winners enjoying the death of S2X do not care less about growth. Instead, they see a way towards growth that need not conflict with decentralization. 
There is no threat that blocksize will remain at Segwit's effective-2MB size forever.  Instead, there are plans to raise it in a safe and controlled manner, after we see how much capacity Lightning Network delivers.  People wishing to use real Bitcoin transactions that do not depend on trusting a third party are not limited to a dozen transactions per second, because every off-chain Lightning Network transaction is a real transaction that could be posted to the Bitcoin blockchain to claim the value in the channel.
The Bitcoin network did not "accept" any compromise in July.
The ideological issue isn't undermining any financial establishment, but rather opting out of exploitive central bank policies, like [NIRP](  And there's no populist fervor for that, because it's too complicated to explain through the constant stream of financial propaganda.
Successful movements do not need pragmatic leaders, who can be decapitated.  They only need a cause, which cannot be killed.

How Bitcoin behaves has always been a matter of what the protocol supports, and the protocol was designed for decentralization.  The field was empty several years ago and no fees were necessary, but this was not a sustainable direction for the ecosystem.  It has been very clear, since the beginning, that Bitcoin will either evolve to preserve its decentralization, or it will die the death of becoming Paypal.


How about this: I'm seriously not telling you what to do, and I'm seriously not accepting complaints that you can't participate in fixing other problems.


So do I, and I agree with you that these projects, too, need to improve their fee handling.


Real ecommerce, or real decentralized ecommerce?  I'll take the latter, and am willing to pay fees while we improve the infrastructure to get there.  We're not there yet, and I believe I'm more realistic than you about whether usage before the fee infrastructure for small transactions is ready constitutes playing around.

ORLY?  How about capital goes out, capital gains timer starts, then capital comes in from a sale, and that's your taxable event.  Notice there's nothing in the middle.  Income is not generated until you sell.


Bullshit.  It is not finding free money.  First off, not everyone has found it - only successful sellers will be shown to have done so.  Second, we are talking about an asset class that people purchased, which means our principles are to be focused on capital gains, not income.  Since the linked blog post on CrossLaw does not mention spinoffs at all, it is reasonable to conclude incompetence.


Nope.  If money to buy your capital went out more than a year ago, then a sale at any time qualifies for long term capital gains.
These are the simplest principles to apply to the asset class.

This is a very interesting perspective, with some useful definitions that I hope we see used more often.  
I would have focused more on the long-term versus short-term pain.  "Crypto-Austrians" are onboard with an excellent story for improving transaction speed (LN), without hurting security, but it means waiting for a short time while developers get it deployed.  Loss of security is a long-term pain, which is why the Crypto-Austrians were so strong in their opposition.
In this view, it's up to Crypto-Keynesian businesses to plan their cash flow for a realistic pace of development when considering features that help medium of exchange.  One way they can plan is by supporting development that speeds up features they *and* Crypto-Austrians want.

SHA-256 replaced MD4, MD5, and SHA-1.  These things [break](  However, they have previously broken in ways that generally leak information through the academic community over a period of years, and Satoshi did something cool so that Bitcoin will have even more time to adapt.  
MD2 failed slowly [between 1997 and 2009](  SHA-1 failed [between 2005 and 2017](  In the Bitcoin world, we have already seen [ASICBOOST]( change our understanding of the effort it takes to complete a double-SHA256 hash.
The kind of failure that would affect Bitcoin is called a [preimage attack](  Since the easiest preimage attacks work by appending "combo hits" to a known starting point, Bitcoin constrains the length of its second SHA-256 to be the fixed-length output of its first SHA-256.  You can see that this leaves nowhere to append "combo hits".  Because of Satoshi's care in *how* the hashing algorithm is used, the community generally feels there is a lot of time to understand SHA-256's imperfections.

Paragraph (e)(2)(B), which specifies a $200 limit for exempting personal transactions from any consideration of gain, would only apply if you are going to argue that bitcoins are a "[nonfunctional currency](  If bitcoins are not-nonfunctional, then we might conclude that such limit does not even apply.

It depends on whether you believe it's "fast enough" to explore the set of economically useful smart contracts at the speed that developers can experiment with new script versions (which require consensus changes, but not hard forks) and sidechains (which also require some opcode support), or whether total freedom to "move fast and break things" makes for a better contract language to back your assets on the market.

The rise of ASICs was expected, but unexpectedly quick.
Several key problems were unsolved when Bitcoin was released.  One of the consistent tradeoffs Satoshi made was to pick the most publicly tested way to do something.  In the [world of proof of work]( the only memory-focused option at the time was bcrypt.  But it had never seen the scrutiny of iterated-SHA256, and its underlying cipher already had [known weaknesses](  SHA256 was a conservative choice.
One of the advantages to this simpler design choice is that any fabrication lab can get into SHA256 ASIC design, providing no foreseeable advantage to anyone over the long run.  However, the unexpectedly quick rise of ASICs showed us all how powerful the short term advantage was.


If the project can survive long enough without changing proof of work, then SHA256 ASICs will end up very available to the typical person.

* Ask questions about why commodities have value.  
* Ask lots and lots of questions about why houses sometimes sell for more than they can rent for over the course of the mortgage.  
* What are people doing when they look for value that the government cannot inflate away?  
* Is everything an equal safe haven, or are some assets more receptive?  
* What is the role of the network?  What other companies are valued for their network?

Because for people with good technical understanding, electrical infrastructure, ASIC supply (including in-house design), and access to capital, they can get their coins cheaper that way than spending fiat on an exchange.
Money goes into mining as long as a profit margin exists on mining.  Once too many miners are in (or a halving occurs), and profit is exhausted, their decisions shift to pick up the coins on the marketplace.
This is why stock-to-flow controls the price of commodities.  You might be ready to read [The Bitcoin Standard](  You can also see some of the charts [plotted by PlanB](

looking for numbers that can be measured, they pick hashrate as their
proxy for trust.  As was made clear during the Segwit2X attack and
UASF defense, those who run a full node don't have to trust the miners
to verify the blockchain.  The authors are aware of this distinction,
but don't have a completely satisfactory way to build it into their

Speculation at specialized locations is a better outreach mechanism than spending.  People can already find others to exchange with, so market size is currently limited by speculative belief, not merchant activity.  
This leaves store of value as the strongest basis for money.  Bitcoin has a lot more adoption and speculative smoothing technology (derivative trading) to integrate before it is a nice and boring store of value.
In order to not get stuck in a referential loop based purely on scarcity (like gemstones), it's very helpful to any wannabe money when everyday merchant activity is possible.  This requires commodity-level fungibility that allows quick verification.  It's great if something like the lightning network gives Bitcoin a better medium of exchange story than dollar bills, Paypal, and credit cards.  But this can develop over time.  
It is not necessary to take any unnatural exchange loss to use bitcoins in places where you could otherwise spend fiat that is burning a hole in your pocket.  Let the technology get better and more widespread, and let more people get sick of how bad fiat money is.
Your instinct to spread the word is not misplaced, but merchants are not as important as you think.  It is sufficient to hodl, until they offer you a percentage discount to let go of your bitcoins.

Segwit changes it, to make it obvious.


The incentive change leaves legacy options alone.  That's not pointless, it's careful.


I brought it up while talking about miners, but it's more important to full nodes, to keep expenses down.

All current Bitcoin investors assume that rollbacks are very bad for the perceived stability of the network, and therefore very bad for its use in storing value.
Here are two ANTI-stabilizing interventions that can occur in a rollback:
* blacklisting stolen coins
* in a court of law, suing known miners who accept bribes from a thief (trying to prevent a rollback)
If you look at the formula that u/pwuille uses in his answer, both of these interventions complicate it and promote rollback.  
All destabilization also chooses arbitrary winners and losers from subsequent non-theft transactions, since they were designed to be atomic.  Though stopping the thief is a good intention, the unintended consequences of these interventions are worst for those who were not affected by the theft.  Governments aren't helping here; they like blacklisting and their courts of law support the lawsuits.
As the block reward decreases, rollback threats will become more viable.  The most powerful tool for preventing the rollbacks is preventing the theft in the first place.  That will come, as long as hardware isn't compromised by design.  The most powerful tool for preventing these additional destabilizing effects will be confidential transactions.  That's more in question.  Many current Bitcoin investors want to delay true fungibility improvements, considering the détente resulting from a public record of transactions to be beneficial.  But it can't last.
TLDR: Long-term value depends on fungibility.

Titled assets are also not as simple and management-free as a digital commodity.
With your examples, although people can consider some of their qualities as worthy of a price premium, and can use them as investments that are a substitute for money when fiat currency is inflating away, none of them make particularly good money.
The book is pretty awesome.  It explains all this very well.

One year is not the far future they're warning of.  A time-lock one year ahead will (with very high probability) be perfectly valid when the time-lock expires.
A [recent post of mine](addresses how hash algorithms fail over a period of years.  ECDSA should offer a few warning signs too.  The quantum stuff is going through a hype cycle and is not imminent.
There is no guarantee that deep algorithm bugs will come with any warning at all, but that's a risk everyone should already be aware of.  So far, no previously recorded non-dust transaction has been made unspendable by an upgrade.

Do you really open your Trezor's case and observe the board every time you use it?  Someone with the knowledge to mod the board would make sure to close or replace the case to disguise their mod.

This should be true eventually, but we're not there yet, and the equilibrium will likely be lower than 6.25 bitcoins.  The marginal change in rollback risk will be lower in distant future halvings, and more significant in the next few halvings.

An anonymous author supposedly finds two young Iranians with an S9.

There is an old maxim to sell 10% each time it doubles.
Since it's not as big a commitment it's easier to actually do it.

It's a phrase commodities people use to distinguish from "paper" securities, like the "cash-settled" futures over at CME, or ETF holdings.
IOW, it means you get out your wallet and generate your own address.

Two person economy: you, and a banker.  There is no money in the economy to start.  You get a $1 loan from the banker (which they create out of thin air) and owe the banker $2 after interest.  You admire the money for a while (or put it to use in your business) and pay the banker $1 back, which the banker has assigned mostly to their interest (profits).  They don't have to cancel $1 of principle out of their thin-air trickery, as they will when the loan is paid off fully.  You owe the banker another $1.  How will you get it?  You ask the banker for $1 to pay the banker $1, but they're like, LOL.  The banker says they will pay $0.10 each time you sweep the bank floor.  Remember, they have the profits from the loan.  You sweep the floor ten times.  The banker gives you the same $1 that you had already returned to them.  You pay the banker back that same $1, which you still owe as the loan principle.  The loan is completed, and according to the rules of thin-air trickery, also the money that was created for the loan.  The $1 is removed from the economy, and there is again no money in the economy.  You received money when your time preference demanded it, and the banker got some janitorial work.

Check out [this discussion](which suggests adoption impulses are slowing down.  If you think the reasoning is wrong there, I'd love to hear why.  Otherwise, you might be able to combine that with your impulses based on halving intervals to get a better result.

I'm not addressing fairness, or the effort of the banker, or justifying a centrally managed fractional reserve system in any way.  I'm addressing the claim that interest attached can only be paid by borrowing more.  The claim is false.

There's a lot of tsk-tsk here for not being a better trader, but that's what hodling is all about: not being a good trader and knowing it, and sticking it out and winning anyway.
