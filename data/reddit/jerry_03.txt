i actually have about $1000 invested in bitcoin for my 5 year old. However the majority of his investment I have in a more traditional investment, a 529 Plan College Savings account.
The bitcoin investment is just for fun

In a way I'm glad I never got into BTC when it was in the $5-10 range back in  like 2011ish. I knew about btc since 2010 but never bought anything until literally this year.
If I had bought it back then I would of most likely sold when it was only at 100 or 500.

i will forever be kicking myself for not buying bitcoin when I first heard about it in 2010. I thought it was just a novel thing and never dreamed it would catch on. I finally bought my first coin 3 months ago.
However I would be kicking myself even more if I did buy it back in 2010 and then immediately spent it.

hey guys im finally about to get into bitcoin. i knew about it back in 2011, 2012 because Im in IT and there was low key articles about it back then on IT websites. I just thought cryptocurrency was some cool novel thing that would never catch on. obviously ive been wrong and i've been kicking myself since then for not buying any.
anyways im finally ready to buy some this year. what exchange do you recommend I use?

$7900, going back up to $8k. 
You guys think its gonna stay at $8k for a week or two then go up to $9k or more?
Correction and then back down to $4k?

Agreed. I know I wont.
My gf has recently got some coin and shes wanting to sell when it hits $9k. I'm trying to convince her to hold on to it.
