Hey Alex from [CoinTracking]( here. I agree that most of the time buying things with crypto is not very practical. It's useful to think of it like gold, and like gold people will probably rush into BTC if a recession hits or if something dramatic happens on the world scene. One small benefit of using crypto to buy things is if markets are down and you take a loss when you buy something, you can write the loss off at tax time as a capital loss. I don't think that Canada lets you write off capital losses against ordinary income (like salary income) but if you trade stocks or if you sold property (like a car or a house) you can probably write off your loss against those types of gains. A side note: we are one of the only crypto tax software companies that support the exact accounting method used to calculate cost basis in Canada. We have a free subscription option you can use to check us out if you're interested.

I think they should have given crypto users a de minimis exemption. That would have encouraged more people to use crypto. As it stands now, every purchase-- no matter how tiny-- has to be accounted for at tax time. It's actually good news for the company I work for ([CoinTracking]( because more people will use our software, but in countries like Germany you can buy day-to-day things like coffee without worrying about tax implications. In France, crypto-to-crypto trades are not taxable. Side note: if you're a US-based beginner crypto trader with 200 transactions or less, you can create a tax report with us for free. We're one of the only crypto tax platforms that offers a free subscription option.

Hi Alex from [CoinTracking]( here. You may want to look into Germany. Crypto is treated essentially like foreign currency there, so I imagine income taxes would be more straightforward and the banking system is probably a bit more crypto friendly. Malta also has clear crypto regs, as does the UK's Isle of Man. Check us out if you need a crypto tax software. You can create an account for free and create free tax reports if you have 200 transactions or less.

What everyone else has said is true. You probably do have to pay taxes on your winnings, even though you haven't sold. However, there are a few different cost basis methods you can use to determine the cost basis of your winnings when you received your prize. Generally as long as you stick with the same cost basis accounting method, the IRS will accept it. I work at [CoinTracking.info]( which lets you use 11 different accounting methods. You can use it for free to generate a tax report if you have 100 transactions or less. This'll let you see if you can save money by using an alternative accounting method before you submit.

I work in the industry so I'm generally long on Bitcoin and I have high hopes for the crypto in general, as do many other thought leaders that I've contacted... but if it came down to it I would get property instead! Bitcoin whales tend to make me nervous. Too many Bitcoins are concentrated in the hands of a few in my opinion. Bitcoin has some troubling governance issues as well. I'm sure this will get sorted out eventually but until then? Maybe I'm paranoid, but if I were you I would just stack some sats and buy property instead. There are some tax breaks you can take advantage of to reduce your rental income gains. Also any capital gains you make from selling property can be offset by any losses you take from trading crypto, so there is some potential synergy there.

@_date: 2019-10-21 13:59:23
Hey Alex with [CoinTracking]( here. Actually according to the guidance it looks to me like the cost basis should be calculated at the precise time when the fork funds became available, not at the closing price for the day. Per the IRS FAQ:
"The amount included in income is the fair market value of the cryptocurrency when you received it.  You have received the cryptocurrency when you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of it, which is generally the **date and time** the airdrop is recorded on the distributed ledger. "

Hey, Alex with [CoinTracking]( here. We make software that automates the process of doing your crypto taxes.
I did some research about this because I wrote a blog about lost Bitcoins recently. The blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis says that 17% to 23% of all Bitcoins are lost. Coins are lost mainly when people die or lose their keys. Apparently Wired magazine lost $100,000 worth of Bitcoin because they lost their key. In Canada, the founder of an exchange called QuadrigaCX (supposedly) died and many of its reserve cryptos were lost, since the founder was the only one that had access to most of the accounts.
As to how they were acquired in the first place: people can buy Bitcoin on exchanges, or mine Bitcoin. You can also send Bitcoin to someone directly. 
Bitcoin mining is not as mysterious as you might think. Here's a very basic explanation: The Bitcoin network gives people money as a reward for processing transactions for the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network is decentralized and runs on many different computers, like a torrent. The network creates new Bitcoins and the new Bitcoins go to miners. All this is done automatically and everything is verified with encryption.
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:35:02
Hi Alex from CoinTracking here. Welcome to crypto! It's a fascinating but weird world. 
In my opinion now is not a bad time to get in, because the next Bitcoin halving event is coming up. When it happens, the Bitcoin network will cut the amount of new Bitcoin it creates in half. There will only be 64 halving events. After those, no more Bitcoin will be created, ever again. Demand tends to spike after a halving event, which causes an increase in price. 
Another thing that could drive up the price would be institutional investors. Once the SEC finally approves a crypto ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), big investors will be able to put money into crypto without having to actually go through the hassle of buying and safeguarding their crypto funds.
One thing you should know before you get into Bitcoin is that each time you sell, you trigger a taxable event. I work at [CoinTracking]( and we make software that does your crypto taxes for you. If you have 200 trades or less, you can use it for free-- so check it out and create an account. We have charts that you can use to analyze the Bitcoin bubbles of the past. We also created Bitcoin predictor that attempts to detect when the next big price change will happen.

Hi, Alex with CoinTracking here. It may be useful to consider the tax implications of your trading strategy. If you're just holding, then you're probably fine since in most countries you have to sell to trigger a taxable event. You can find out about crypto tax laws on our [website]( by going to Tax Report --&gt; Tax Information. There's a Tax Information tab there that explains the basics.
@_date: 2019-10-28 11:38:15
Hey Alex with [CoinTracking]( here. This is a very good point. It is unfortunate that the IRS recently decided against giving crypto users a de minimis exemption that would let us do things like buy coffee with Bitcoin without having to worry about taxes. One workaround: set up a wallet that you plan on using for ONLY day-to-day purchases. If you had 200 or less purchases through that wallet you can generate a tax report for free at the end of the year. We support almost every type of wallet out there.
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:18:45
Hey this is Alex from [CoinTracking]( One reason why there are so many coin projects is that anyone with the necessary technical skill can copy Bitcoin's source code and start a new coin. Bitcoin's code is open source, so anyone can use it to create a spin-off. 
Various teams have gone in different directions with cryptocoin tech. Decred, for example, is similar to Bitcoin but it has a totally different governance system. Ripple uses blockchain to speed up fiat fintech systems by letting private banks set up their own crypto nodes. Ethereum is like a decentralized computer because it can run smart contracts and other programs. These are just a few of the most respected projects, but there are many that aren't very original or innovative at all.
One advantage Bitcoin has is its size. New coin projects with smaller networks are easier to compromise. It's easier to do things like initiate a 51% attack, for example. Bitcoin's stakeholders are extremely powerful and rich. They own huge server farms, which they use to mine Bitcoin. These "Bitcoin whales" are motivated to preserve its value and make its price go up. 
However, one big problem with Bitcoin at the moment is that huge amounts of it are concentrated in the hands of just a few individuals. If one of these whales were to suddenly cash out, that could have a dramatic effect on prices. Some believe that these whales sometimes [get together behind the scenes to manipulate markets](

Hi and welcome to crypto on behalf of [CoinTracking]( the most popular crypto tax calculator!
1. The decentralized blockchain network acts kind of like a server, but actually you're interfacing with thousands of different computers when you send Bitcoin. Remember: you aren't really sending anything from your computer when you send Bitcoin to someone. You're just moving money around in the cloud, so to speak. Bitcoin's blockchain is stored across many different nodes and it's all encrypted. These nodes (aka miners) host the blockchain and process transactions for the network in exchange for mining rewards. Your wallet just gives you the ability to access your encrypted storage space on the blockchain.  
2. If your computer got hit with a ransomware attack, you could purchase crypto through an exchange and then send it to the hacker's address. Of course there is no guarantee that they will unlock your computer for you after you do this.
3. Not all websites support Bitcoin, but many do. We accept Bitcoin payments, for example. So does Overstock and many other companies.

The new guidance does seem to say that any forked coins you get, you have to add to your yearly income. Ordinarily, you can hold on to your coins and you wouldn't create a taxable event until you cash out.
Per the IRS: "If a hard fork is followed by an airdrop and you receive new cryptocurrency, you will have taxable income in the taxable year you receive that cryptocurrency."

If you do decide to get into day trading, you'll need to sign up with an exchange that offers good liquidity and low fees. Binance and Kraken are two good choices.

I write for CoinTracking and I sometimes interview CPAs that work with us. One mentioned that the IRS is the  spender in blockchain analytics. I looked it up and it's true. The IRS is outsourcing the analytical work to different firms and they are spending millions to do this. But actually not much analysis is needed, since most of the information they need can be obtained by any of the exchanges. They all require you to upload your ID when you join. So all the IRS has to do is request that information, and then they can link your wallet to you. If hackers raid an exchange, they could steal the ID info and use it to find and harass people who have large Bitcoin wallets. It's a little creepy, actually, how public Bitcoin is. Privacy coins like Monero have far more anonymity features and you can even trade them on exchanges privately. You may want to look into Monero and other privacy coins if you're worried about privacy. Reuters has a good explainer on it. Also check out [CoinTracking]( if you need tax software.

The exemption is probably for gains only. Your income is still taxable, but you don't have to pay taxes if your capital gain was less than 600 Euros when you cashed out. In other words if you got 600 euros worth of crypto and then prices went up and you now have 700 euros worth of crypto, you wouldn't have to pay taxes on that 100 gain. But you would probably have to pay taxes on the initial 600. I work at [CoinTracking]( and we are based in Germany.

Hey Alex with [CoinTracking.info]( here. Just chiming in to say that if any of the Bitcoin whales cash out, the price of Bitcoin could crash. Something like 1,000 people control 40% of the supply of Bitcoin. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future, but until then it's a big risk. On the plus side, Bitcoin could surge if the economy crashes next year like many people are saying. Plus, there's a halving event coming up next year. What I'm basically saying is: it might be useful to think of Bitcoin like gold. It might not be a good idea to put all your savings into it, but it is probably a good way to hedge against an economic slump.
