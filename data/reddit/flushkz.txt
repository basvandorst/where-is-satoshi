Be honest with yourself man. You're looking for a thrill. I told myself I'm not a a gambler for the longest time because I don't enjoy casino games. High risk investments make my dick hard though. Just be yourself, life is short.

Nah, that's only remotely threatening if you're engaged in sustained vigor. Like dancing all night like a cunt. Neurotoxicity of high levels of BOTH serotonin and dopamine is the only real "damage yourself" factor outside of peculiar circumstances

Nah, that hasn't been an issue in CO for years. The taxes are very high. In such situations, businesses really value cash because they can not report it, alleviating the cost of business. It can make a huge difference. The prevalence of cash only businesses in NYC are a great example.
