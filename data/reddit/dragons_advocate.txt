I thought that was going to happen as a new twist on an old meme. Disappoint.

Don't explain jokes at parties.

Despite my initial investment, your comment karma isn't growing as fast as I had hoped.

The straw man is this: I can label something I do as "libertarian" and suddenly it doesn't matter what I do, I'm an economic genius. That's pretty one-sided.

I come to this Subreddit to watch people fight over the power of their trinkets and tokens. It's like I'm reliving my prime Dark Souls years.

Mmm! Logical. Almost like anarchy isn't a system, or something...
Edit: To clarify myself, no you were not advocating for anarchy,
Edit2: I was making a snarky comment on the overly zealous "libertarianism" of this coin-culture. Though I made it sound like was aiming at you. I was trying to agree with your points about regulations being inherent to a structure's integrity. For instance, if they wanted to keep things decentralized, you'd need someone or something to ensure that. But we don't and likely won't for a while. So it gets manipulated.

Does your fear include the moment when government shrugs its shoulders, and does nothing at all? Because that's what  most of the government agencies "go to" response is. Few agencies organize and collect information as well as the NSA does. We always hand over control to various agencies, like the DMV for example, but the real issue isn't handing over that information so much as the brittle, heavily-centralized control of information. Like the NSA potentially having enough knowledge on the entirety of the US to commit a seamless coup.
Edits: words.

Bitcoin is the Jesus, in this case. It's either that or "Free Market." It's a magical entity that just works because I say so, basically Jesus. I'm certain someone will show up and spout some Free Market scripture at me just for saying this.
