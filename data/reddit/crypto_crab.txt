What does lightning have to do with bitcoin decentralization? It is a SEPARATE LAYER. It does not affect bitcoin in any way.

Scammers? Really? If you can offer the same service at a lower price I suggest you scoop up the market share for yourself.

How will anyone sell bitcoin without KYC?

Wow I had no idea you could do that in Canada! Thanks for the info. Do you know if they have to KYC to get cash out?

lol no let's skip all of that and have you just tell us how any atm anywhere could distribute Bitcoin without following existing law and not be shut down.

If the block size had been increased then lightning would have had more time. But now BC is fighting with lots of other coins and is losing momentum. I think it is great that people are using it and making transactions. Keeps BC in the running as the future of money. Keeps BC in the news. And keeps people excited about the future of BC.

But only when more people use segwit. In the meantime new coins are getting the spotlight.
