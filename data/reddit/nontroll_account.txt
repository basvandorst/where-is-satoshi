From the left's perspective, in theory, the reason the government regulates finance and banking, is because when finance and banking are privately controlled, those private parties have a corrupting influence on the system to the detriment of the public. 
But Bitcoin is not privately controlled: it's publicly controlled and operated. Indeed, It's the first time such a thing has been truly possible. Because it's publicly controlled, there is no risk of the private owners corrupting it, like with banking, and thus no need for the regulations which must be applied to banks. 
The problem is, both sides have gotten used to the idea that "public=government," and so, the left doesn't realize that the government doesn't need to be controlling bitcoin, and i hear libertarians argue that bitcoin isn't a public thing.
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:12:42
I've never been quite clear here on what y'all mean by the Fed having a monopoly. On what specifically? Not money creation; all banks practice fractional reserve banking, and thus contribute to the money supply.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:21:25
I find it fascinating that it's mostly libertarians who support bitcoin, since the problem with the banking system is that it's controlled with absolute power by the private sector. Like, the POTUS may get to name the chair of the Fed (a private bank), but he has to choose from a selection of like 13 that THEY choose for him. The united states government has extremely limited influence on the Fed. 
The international banking cartels are the reason we need a publicly controlled banking system. Unfortunately, "public" has become a euphemism for "government controlled" for the last 250 years, because there hasn't been any real way to implement truly public efforts, that have any power, until the bitcoin protocol came along. 
But the left has been slow to remember that we don't want government power for it's own sake, but rather, only for the sake of protecting us from corporations and cartels.

Food has value only to the hungry and to those wanting to store it up either for when they are hungry, or to sell it. 
Its value isn't intrinsic. It has value because it is a means to an end (sating hunger), and thus, by definition its value wouldn't be intrinsic. It's value increases or decreases wildly, depending on lots of things, like one's hunger, whether it has rotted, its palatability, whether others around you are hungry, and so on, such that one may even throw it in the trash as having negative value.  
The only things I can think of that *would* have intrinsic value are the ones I mentioned elsewhere. I would argue that some things, like the enjoyable act of creative expression, or novelty, or sleep, or other positive experiences, have intrinsic value. But no physical object would ever qualify as having intrinsic value though, not even food. Those things have intrinsic value though, only because those positive experiences themselves cannot be extricated from the evaluator himself.

I don't think my argument is a product of culture. I think think that the reason that banks might be so dominant as to be un-topple-able is that they currently have so much power, that they will exercise that power when their system is threatened. 
They not only have the power of money production, but the very act of exchanging money itself, not to mention incalculable influence on the creation and modification of the laws of governments.. 
The case of Visa and the other banks forbidding sending money to Wikileaks' Julian Assange after the big leak by Bradley Manning a few years ago is probably the best *small scale* example of how they could react if at any point they decided that this whole Bitcoin shenanigans needs to stop. I shudder to think what they might do if they felt like large scale action was necessary.
They wouldn't invest in Bitcoin, because they're much more concerned with the even greater power of being able to control the money supply and transfer of money. No matter how valuable Bitcoin got, investing in it would not be worth the loss of the power create and control the money supply and exchange thereof. 
I hope that Bitcoin can overcome that, though, but I'm not sure it can.

from that article


Or perhaps that's a profoundly stupid dichotomy? perhaps money (and other things) had origins that were not associated whatsoever with government, but were also not "private" at all either? 
Bitcoin isn't privately controlled, it's publicly controlled. Yes, I'm using "publicly controlled" literally, and not as a euphemism for "government controlled." The opposite of "private" isn't "government," but rather, public. The author of the article seems to so blitheringly assume that government is the opposite of private, it's pathetic. 
Money is simply a tool of power. The struggle for the control of that power between governments and banks is actually a quite old struggle. Currently, the banks control money creation, and tell governments what to do. If anyone doesn't believe that someone told obama who to select as the next Federal Reserve chair, that person is hopelessly naive. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:19:11
but "hunger" is not an absolute determiner of value. Some people have an over-active hunger drive, others have none. Some people need, or want, to suppress their hunger drive or eating food, for x or y reason, whereas others need, or want, to increase their hunger drive or amount of food they eat, for x or y reason. 
You may have to fast for a bloodwork test. You may be trying to lose weight. You may be fasting for religious purposes. You may be fasting because none of the food you have access to is appetizing to you, or because you want to be hungry for your big dinner later. You may be avoiding food around you because you regard the food available to you as unhealthy. You may be on a hunger strike.
See, to person A, the value of the food they eat is that it eliminates their hunger sensation. To person B, the value of the food they eat is in the aesthetic pleasure of it. To person C, the value of food is that it gives them time to spend with their family. To person D the value of food is that it gives them something to feel competent at. 
For person A, they might find just as much value from a zero-calorie snack which fills their stomach as from a "legitimate" bit of food. Person B might do the same thing, but for a totally different reason. And so on. 
But the biggest problem is the broad meaning of "food." Would that zero-calorie snack count? It would to some. What about food with lots of chronically harmful substances, like bad fats or high fructose corn syrup? That might count to you, but not to others. 
Furthermore, there is no universally shared food. Perhaps you mean to say it has intrinsic value because "it" is a common shared thing among all humans which every human needs in order to keep living. But again, **it would only have value, by extension, to those who value continuing to live.** 
Value is ALWAYS subjective. There is ALWAYS an evaluator to whom a thing or experience is or is not valuable. Food is only valuable to a particular individual on a particular occasion (granted, repeated and frequent), which means that its value is not inherent or intrinsic; *otherwise any given evaluator would always value it positively.* 
@_date: 2014-09-14 05:10:25
Indeed. Fuck Goldman Sachs. Monstrous bastards. 
The problem is that they (those 6 banks) DO have all that power. My point here is that they have no intention of letting some computer code usurp their power, and they will exercise any means necessary to crush any substantial resistance to or rebellion against their continued power. 
This is my concern. I hope against all hope that Bitcoin can do it.

I would actually argue that there is no such thing as intrinsic value, because the word value is inherently defined by something outside of it, and intrinsic is an exclusively inextricable internal feature of a thing. 
It is an oxymoron. If there were no people to value anything nothing would have value. It is the evaluator who gives value to anything. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:04:07
I like Bitcoin because it takes the power of money production out of the hands of the banks. It makes it unregulatable, but that's because it doesn't need to be regulated, since it is no longer privately controlled, but *truly* publicly controlled (here publicly controlled isn't just a euphemism for government controlled). 
Most libertarians seem to think that the governments are in control of money production, when, at best, the banks allow them to have a moderate say in some aspects of it. 
I am excited that the banks are having their previously unstoppable and downright evil power so effectively subverted by Bitcoin.

The beauty of bitcoin is that it's ACTUALLY an anti-bank idea. 
It's the banks who create your money and control the set of private ledgers that define how much money anyone has. Governments were the ones who eventually gave into pressure to legalize the previously illegal practice of fractional reserve banking.  
The people who stand to lose power from Bitcoin are banks. Not governments. Now, yeah, people in government benefit from being the bodyguards over the banks power, but in much the same way an employee benefits from his employer. Bitcoin, for the first time in history, threatens that power in a way that just bypasses most of government's ability to influence.

No physical object would ever qualify as having intrinsic value though, not even food. Look at how much food gets thrown away because nobody wants it.

Those things have intrinsic value though, only because those positive experiences themselves cannot be extricated from the evaluator himself.

And it SHOULDN'T. Just because one side managed to turn "public" into a euphemism for "government", and the other side just went along with it, doesn't mean that the other side can go and make the word "private" mean "the opposite of government." 
And even if that were okay, and it were accurate to say that those are the only two options, it's STILL a stupid dichotomy, because the origin of money could have been a complicated, interconnective, inter-related, joint "collaboration" between both ancient "governments" (it's really iffy to call them that, but, whatever), and "private" efforts.

This is about someone making a request to exchange value between specific parties' entries in the private banking ledger system, specifically, to lower Coinbase's ledger entry, and increase the ledger value of X. 
The fact that they are doing that, regardless of the reason, means that they have to follow the rules that those in charge of that system. It doesn't matter what service you're making that ledger entry exchange *in exchange for*, whether it is buying a car house, getting a loan, making a donation, or having someone give you the private keys for some bitcoin addresses; If you use their ledger system, you follow their rules. 
You can't blame Coinbase for this. If Coinbase refused to play by their rules, they'd kick Coinbase out of their game. 
Bitcoin isn't just another currency. It is an entirely different ledger system. If you have value logged in the current banking ledger system, but would rather have value logged in the Bitcoin ledger system, OR VICE VERSA, (that is, If you have value logged in the bitcoin ledger system and would rather have some value logged in the current banking ledger system,) BOTH OF THOSE require an exchange using the current banking ledger system, and as such MUST follow those rules, or risk getting your entries in the current banking ledger system frozen or even deleted. 
The only way around that is to use cash, which is no solution, because A) cash is really just another entry in their ledger system (a receipt), and B) cash composes a nearly negligible amount of the value compared to the rest of the values in the ledger system. 
This is why, if the banks get together and decide, "No. Fuck Bitcoin!" there is literally nothing stopping them from just freezing the accounts of anybody known to make exchanges in their system in exchange for Bitcoin.  
This honestly scares me, and I hope somebody has a solution to it.

More than just the "central bank." The central bank is what the government created in order to at least get some imaginary level of control over the banks doing the previously illegal practice of fractional reserve banking. 
Every bank robs your dollars of their value and puts it in their own pockets, because of the nature of the way banks create money. It's not that the government authorizes them to do so, it's that the government can't stop them, and so made the practice of fractional reserve banking legal and "regulated" it, so they wouldn't appear powerless against the banks.

The current money system is a set of privately controlled ledgers, with relatively easily recognized and counterfeited, generic physical receipts. You have money if, and only if, a bank ledger says you do, or if you have counterfeit physical receipts which a bank will accidentally treat as a valid entry on their ledger. This is why this system was originally refered to as [fiat]( You have money because the bank says it is so, and for no other reason.
Bitcoin is a publicly controlled ledger, impossible to counterfeit, and for which it is difficult to make consistent, easily recognizable receipts. You have bitcoin because, and only because the public bitcoin ledger says you do. In a way, bitcoin exists by fiat of the bitcoin protocol. 
The fact that it is not privately controlled, but rather, publicly controlled, is the single greatest feature of bitcoin, followed closely by the inability to counterfeit it. This means that the money supply cannot be manipulated by corrupt interests. 
The two downsides of bitcoin compared to the current system, because of this, is that 1) it is impossible to undo fraudulent transactions, because the private entities no longer have the power to make fiat adjustments to the ledger, and 2) the utility of cash is really really hard to emulate with bitcoin.

Here's the thing. All the money in your bank account and everybody's bank accounts and in the stock market etc. is part of one interconnected ledger system. 
When you buy Bitcoin, that bank-fiat money doesn't leave that ledger system. It still exists on somebody's ledger entry. And to take it from you OR give it back to you, ***they have to follow the rules of that bank-fiat money ledger system.***

Cash is redeemable for an entry in their ledger system recorded by them and attached to your name. Once you've done that, you can make electronic payments and all that stuff. 
And technically speaking, cash is literally a federal reserve bank note (that is, a receipt).
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:06:22


But why bother??
Once upon a time, gold, minted into coins, was used as currency. but it was heavy to carry around, so people stored it in bank vaults.
The banks gave them a receiept for the amount of gold they had in the bank. People eventually started trading those reciepts, called bank notes, as currency, instead of the government minted coins. 
These bank notes were used as currency because of the common trust that eveyrone had in those banks. 
The banks decide, "hey, we've got all this gold just sitting here, because nobody's withdrawing it to use it as money; it's not actually worth as much to them as our notes are! Well, since their gold just sitting here, we might as well loan it out!"
"But you can't loan out other people's money, just because it's in your vaults!"
"shut up"
And so, bank notes became currency which the people believed were actually reciepts for their gold in the vaults. It got to the point that many people never even saw the government minted gold coins anymore, because they used bank notes as money.
One day, people got suspicious, and everybody tried withdrawing their gold from the bank all at once. Well, it wasn't there. In fact, the receipts for gold actually exceeded the total amount of gold anyone had actually put in the vaults. 
The government was upset about this. They made laws against the practice, and audited banks. 
But banks are more powerful, and eventually all that stopped, and they were actually given permission to loan out more gold than they had. 
This was such a lucrative business for the banks that eventually, they convinced the government to remove the restriction to have any actual gold there at all. The switch was complete! We banks issue money now, not the government, and now it's official!
Etc etc.

I'm talking long term. If there were a large scale attempt to switch to bitcoin, and the banks decided that was unacceptable, forbidding any electronic money transfer of any kind which could buy bitcoin, The whole world couldn't just withdraw all their cash and pay it to people who had bitcoin in order to buy it, because there isn't enough cash in the world for everyone to make withdrawls all at once, and even if every bit of physical cash in the world landed in the hands of bitcoin sellers, it would be a tiny amount compared to the ledger entries that the banks have on file for people. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:29:42

I disagree. Even very subtle, nuanced variations can have an enormous effect on user perception. Often times, even a native, educated English speaker may not know what the best sounding way to phrase things might be, but the difference on the reader's end can be tremendous. 
The difference between "eh, it's technically right," and "it sounds perfectly phrased, like you might find on a Microsoft or Apple page," can be the difference between mass adoption and mediocrity.

The goal is to change which ledger system the world uses for it's money/&lt;value storage and exchange&gt; system, out of the centralized hands of the banks, and into a decentralized cryptocurrency. 
The problem is that they don't want us switching ledgers, and they'll bend over backwards to ensure that we don't. 
If I have a lot of value listed on the Banking system ledger and would like to have value on the Cryptocurrency ledger instead, I have to trade my entry x on &lt;international banking system's ledger&gt; to someone else in exchange for person B's entry A on &lt;cryptocurrency ledger&gt;. But the value never *leaves* &lt;international banking system's ledger&gt;. It just gets shuffled around to Person B's entry on &lt;international banking system's ledger&gt;.
The more people who attempt to "convert" their entries on &lt;international banking system's ledger&gt; into entries in &lt;cryptocurrency ledger&gt;, the higher Person B's entry in &lt;international banking system's ledger&gt; gets. 
All it'll take for the move to the new ledger system is banks deciding they're done letting these "Person Bs" amass &lt;international banking system ledger&gt; make those sort of ledger exchanges with people. 
They may employ government muscle if they get desperate, but that's unlikely at this point, i fear.

Ignoring the irony that banks are the ones who actually make money, they would make a profit by lending people money which they actually have, and charging interest on the payment of that loan. Or charging a fee to use their services. 
Currently, they lend people money that they don't even have, and that's how money is created. Sure there may be government restrictions placed on them for various conditions in all of it but that's what it boils down to.

My money exists as an entry in the banking system's ledger, specifically, my bank. 
If I wish to purchase bitcoins from someone using my money, I have to make a transfer of value from my entry in the bank's ledger, to the seller's entry on his bank's ledger. The banks aggressively enforce clear identity. 
I mean, I could make that transfer of value by getting receipts redeemable for their listed value at a bank, (some people call it cash), but that means I have to physically go some place and physically take the significant time to meet someone in person, in public, and take a significant risk, bringing a large sum of bank receipts with me.

Of course they do. The regulation enforced by the bitcoin protocol would be precisely that which prevents corruption. Until now, the only way to regulate any economic action was through the equally corruptible means of government imposed regulation, meaning it hasn't done a good job of it, and frequently has made the corruption deeper and worse. But just because bitcoin restricting actions isn't a government doing it doesn't mean that it isn't, in a very important sense, regulation.

It goes like this. The mass, interconnected ledger system used by the International banking cartels was the only game in town until bitcoin, and allowed them full control of the world's money supply, with a bit of input from a few big, influential countries here and there. Countries attempt to regulate them to curb corruption and abuse, but they also negotiate and offer members of the cartel special privileges. 
Now, the banking cartels' four chief products are:
1. Money lending and money creation (actually the same thing, with banks); 
2. An ability to share in the profits of that money lending; 
3. Money storage; 
4. Money Usage tools, like checks, credit cards, ATMs, and cash (which are really just recipts redeemable for a certain ledger value upon redemption). 
Along comes bitcoin. Impossible to corrupt, and impossible to control, making regulation at once impossible and unnecessary, offering one half of entire product set which was, until bitcoin, only offered by the monopolies of the banking cartel: Money storage, and Usage tools. That is, an alternative open ledger outside of their ledger system, and outside of their control. 
Control is the most important thing . as an example for a long time, YouTube was not profitable for Google, but that didn't matter to them, because it granted Google control of the information flow of the Internet. 
The same is true of the banks. They will be willing to suffer quite a bit of profit loss to prevent loss of control. And they will go to great lengths to destroy bitcoin before it even comes to profit loss. They will sabotage the development and maintenance of bitcoin, as well as any apps that use it, pretending to "partner"  with cryptocurrency devs so as to destroy it from within, or gain control themselves. They will ban you from using any banking services at all if you use bitcoin. They will seize (steal) your assets. They will call you a drug dealing pedophile TERRORIST. They will force utility companies to completely blacklist you. 
And their fight against cryptocurrencies will only get more vicious. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:38:54
Here's the thing. Bitcoin is money in the same way bank money is money. One is a public ledger kept by users of the bitcoin program, whereas the other is a system of interconnected, privately controlled ledgers. You have as much money as the ledger says, simply because the ledger says it. 
They want you to keep using their ledger because it's how they make their money (literally and figuratively). They are not going to allow you to take money from their ledger to start using a ledger that they do not control. Bitcoin is still small potatoes to the banks, and as soon as they decide to put a stop to it, they will. Th will make it so that the only way to buy bitcoin is cash. And that will keep it from growing any bigger. Just like they made it impossible to donate money to wikileaks, they'll make it impossible to buy bitcoin. Because it's THEIR money system. They decide who gets to have any.

@_date: 2013-12-20 13:26:39
No. It won't. Banks only let people exchange dollars or euros or what-have-you for Bitcoin right now because they don't mind yet. As soon as the banks agree that Bitcoin something that they need to stop, they'll just forbid any transactions associated with Bitcoin. It's how they stopped donations to Wikileaks. In fact, they'll just ~~*TAKE* the contents of~~ freeze or cancel any accounts that ~~WERE~~ ARE associated with bitcoin. 
We're going to need to figure out a way around that before Bitcoin can make banks nervous. 
Edit: I was over-zealous in my original assessment the worst that is likely to happen wouldn't be theft or dissolving of the money in accounts, but rather, the worst would more likely be mass freezing of accounts, just because they can. Which, they can.

Bitcoin has weaknesses, namely that eventually production of bitcoins will be monopolized by a very small few with the funds to achieve the processing power. 
PPCoin has the best alternative, but has a really shitty name. (really pissy name?) 
Anyway, anything to get out from the clutches of the private banking industry.

You should never trust anything you find on the internet. anything could be faked. Does this mean you should never use bitcoin? 
Yes, 
But don't let that discourage you from seeking alternative methods to pay on the internet, like Paypal or Google Wallet.

Why would they keep mining if there is no longer any reward of new bitcoins? Transaction fees will get so competitive that it won't be worth it for anybody except those who would take control of the currency.

That is correct, they do not function under free market conditions. In the banking industry, the private banks themselves control the market. their association with governments is not a matter of the governments exercising control over the bank market, but the bank market exercising control over governments.
People began exchanging bank note receipts as if they were the gold itself. Banks started lending out gold and keeping less gold in their reserves than they declared to their customers that they had, and voila, fractional reserve banking. People in other positions of power, like governments, didn't like this at all, and told them that they had to keep a certain amount of gold in their reserves at all times in relation to what they lent. The banks didn't like this, so eventually, they strong-armed the governments into letting them lend however much they wanted, irrespective of how much gold they actually had.  
We have always been a fiat system. a dollar in your hand and a dollar in a checking account are worth something, (the same amount) because of shared mutual trust in the bank. Not the government. Trust in the Bank. 
I felt I needed to point that out, but otherwise, you make a good point. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:46:58
While I think you're overestimating willingness of the Government(s) to hold the banks responsible, and [underestimating the power of banks]( you've convinced me to soften my position. I think it unlikely that they would TAKE money out of accounts, but rather, canceling or freezing accounts would be much more realisitic. 
While it's not THAT much better, I thank you for helping me see hastiness in my thinking.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:26:03
Government  officials?? No, dipshit, the banks agree to let government officials pretend they have a say. Money is too important for it to be controlled by private individuals. Bitcoin is the first truly public sector money ever.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:22:28
Not this specifically, but it is within their power, if they suddenly decide they don't  anymore want people switching their money away from their private ledgers over to the bitcoin public ledger. That's my point - it is in their power, and so a better question would be "why WOULDN'T they?" and "would any of those possible reasons (if there are any) actually be enough to stop them from it?" 
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:14:02
the benefit of Bitcoin is that it completely circumvents most of the need for regulation that exists in the current system. it's impossible (right now) to abuse it, so there is no need for regulation. (I say this as a bleeding heart liberal. I have no desire for the government to regulate something unless abuse is occurring.)
I'd REALLY like to see PPCoin compete with Bitcoin, because it solves all the potential future problems of Bitcoin (like possibility for abuse), but it's got a really shitty name. We really REALLY need to get the fuck out from underneath the psychotic clutches of the banking industry's money creation system.

What?  No, it has nothing to do with innovation, but power. The point is power. They love innovation when it increases their power. The bankers aer not fuddy duddy luddites who fear technology.

you're right. but they also pay for my roads, for public education, for police, foodstamps for several people i know, medicare, and so on.
Not everyone who endorses bitcoin is a free market libertarian. Banks need to be regulated by stronger entities because otherwise they will... well, we've seen what they'll do. That's why money needs government regulation. Bitcoin is the exception. It solves the deeper root that causes the need for regulation, by 1. forcing scarcity, and 2. utterly decentralizing everything so that no one, or even few, parties can control things against the public's interests, and 3. making everything public, and unable to be secretly manipulated by anyone at all. 
Banks need to be regulated because they would (and DO) collectively abuse the public and the lower individuals. With Bitcoin, it's practically impossible to abuse, manipulate, and coerce people the way that banks do. 
I'm poor. I can't pay for my children to be educated all the way through high school and college; i need public education. (I also like living in a society where everyone has gone to school) I need public roads. 
But fuck. these fucking wars on "terrorism" and "drugs" and our fucking privacy are goddamn insane. What do we do? Throw the stupid baby out with the plague infested bathwater? fuck. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 00:50:36


Banks are specialized companies which operate on a market which is regulated to their own whim, and so, between them it is essentially as free a market as exists in the world. 
It is the decentralization of bitcoin that is its primary benefit. it is why it doesn't NEED regulation. Currently, the banks need to be regulated, but they control the regulation, so it kinda fucks everyone else. 
And one more clear thing: All private banks create the money supply, not simply the central banks. in our current system virtually all money is created through loans, and any bank that issues a loan creates money out of thin air.

Well, If you trust wikileaks, you can take their word for it. If you do not, then don't. Worst case scenario is that you're accidentally donating to wikileaks.

The current money system exists as a collection of private ledgers between banks.  
The Bitcoin system exists as a single large public ledger for all users. 
If there comes a threat to those private banks that people will stop using their ledger system as money, then they will simply disallow people from moving "money" (ledger numbers) from their ledgers into the public ledger. 
Banks control the money of the world, because it is their ledgers which declare how much purchasing power anyone has. 
They get to decide which other ledgers are allowed to play in the system, to which other ledgers any bits of money are allowed to be transfered to. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:15:24
Basically. the international banking community which controlled currency was already determined to disconnect from the gold storage business it used to be. indeed already well on its way. 
The only reason fractional reserve banking didn't take off more fully earlier, was because government regulation required them to at least keep a semblence of being in the gold storage industry still. 
Then, finally, they got the free market that they wanted, by agreeing with the government to create the "federal reserve," so they would be free to just print out bank notes by lending them out, with no relation to "gold" in their vaults. 
There were advantages and disadvantages to this.

About 1% of the money in the world is cash. If bitcoin starts getting big, a switch over to it with cash is impossible. Also in most of the United States carrying several thousand dollars in bitcoins is illegal, and can be seized from you without recourse or trial for being drug money.
