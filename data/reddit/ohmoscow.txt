what do you mean it doesnt report on your CC
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:19:32
no clue...literally did hours of research before choosing a CC to leverage my crypto buys
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:45:52
What exactly do you mean by "you can only cash advance from your bank?"
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:31:16
Mah man! OFC I'm doing this!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:51:07
Ah I see. for some reason I have read that some CC companies will charge as cash advance for crypto buys so i was worried...but consider you have used BofA CC to buy then I should be good

You have done this yourself Rektar? Thank you for reply
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:37:04
I honestly have no idea sir. I heard that sometimes certain cc companies will charge cash advance for btc buys
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:25:37
Thank you I was confused why gethooge would say that when everyoen else says otherwise
@_date: 2016-09-11 18:00:42
Can you give me a little more info on it please?
@_date: 2016-09-03 21:06:04
Don;t they all ask for IDs? And also how about TD Ameritrade?
@_date: 2016-09-11 17:36:50
I doubt that, it has to exist, it's a competitive market place with more exchanges than I can count
@_date: 2016-09-11 18:00:30
ahh seriously only 250 a week? do they limit increase?
I need instant buys because I resell bitcoins.  I need to be able to buy as needed without the risk of my investment declining in value.

I should specify, I mean selling Online through cash deposits which are generally safe.
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:05:04
So what you're saying is, I can instantly buy bTC from OKCoin for example, at a .20% fee and send it to my own personal wallet, thus avoiding the coinbase 1.49% instant buy fee?
@_date: 2016-09-11 17:48:05
Hm intersting stuff you're tellig me right now, but do i want to take out a loan? Not really. Do you have experience with circle?
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:15:36
So why do most poeple that use BTC still buy from Coinbase and not from places like Okcoin or gemini if all they are doing is simply buying it
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:28:07
Understood. Very interesting.  So just so i understand fully.  Say I want to buy 1 BTC. I go to gemini deposit some USD from my bank account, put in an order for 1 BTC, pay a .20% fee, receive the 1 BTC instantly, send the 1 BTC to whatever wallet I use and that is all?
Also, are there maximum buy limits on these sorts of trading websites?
@_date: 2016-09-03 21:06:19
How about TD ?
@_date: 2016-09-11 18:01:40
also gdax and gemini, what are the instant buy fees on those like?
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:24:50
Thanks for poitning that out!
