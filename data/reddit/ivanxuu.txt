The meme is talking about a future where the USD has been wiped out, and bitcoin is the only currency. In that situation, it's pointless to switch from BTC to a dead currency like the dollar, even millions, as nobody would accept that anymore. From that moment you just live and pay your stuff with satoshis.

You've just purchase a valuable lesson.
Every time you remember the amount you have lost, a psychical trauma will become more present in your brain. If bitcoin goes up in value, the psychical trauma will go heavier and deeper. But don't worry, that trauma will protect yourself from future mistakes as a guardian angel of the bitcoin heaven.

Did you ever read one of those articles like "lottery winner spend all his millions in 3 years; now is even more broke"?
Most people here will spend all their crypto buying lambos and non sense stuff in just a few years after the real Bitcoin boom.

You can count that:
1) real state is currently used as a store of value, if there was a real non inflactionary asset like bitcoin you can add about 150T
2) debt is because issued money in "circulation": 215T
3) Global money 90T
4) Gold 7T
5) about 4M or bitcoin are lost. So available say about 14M bitcoins
Maths: 
     (150+215+90+7)Trillion USD/14M Bitcoin= 33M USD/Bitcoin
So I think that guy is wrongly conservative. I expect an increase of at least `5500x`.
And you are not even counting inflation, as once any fiat currency crashes, govs tend to hyperinflate the amount.

Previous halving was in July 2016. Bitcoin started to recover and gain value 10 months before that date (October 2015). If history repeats, it will start increasing in value, exactly in August 2019. That's 12 months from now.

Miners will still get the transaction fees. When the blockchain was saturated during the last september the fees were huge, even more than the mined bitcoins.
In the future you will have to choose either to have a transaction saved in the blockchain forever (and pay a fee for it), or use LN.

I'm interested in where did you get the $100M USD bitcoin capitalization. If right now the current money supply which is 81 Trillion (81*10^12) according to [Here’s all the money in the world, in one chart]( that would make a bitcoin worth "only" about $4M USD. What am I missing here? Thanks!

A **seed,** which is a bunch of words, generates an infinite amount of **private keys**. Beside that 'bunch of words', you can add an extra custom text to increase protection.
Each **private key**, generates a **public key** which the user don't see at all anywhere.
A **public key** is used to generate a **bitcoin address**. Bitcoin addresses are important because they are used to receive founds. Some people talk about public keys when they are refering to bitcoin addresses.
The balance shown in electrum is sum of all the balances in any address of your seed.






A **seed** can also generate a **master public key**, which can be used to list absolutely all bitcoin addresses in that seed, but no private key at all. That's a read-only wallet. So its usually a good idea to keep it private. Use it just to know how much bitcoin you have or to create transactions that still need to be signed using the private key to be useful.
To avoid typing the seed everytime you start electrum, electrum creates a file where it writes the seed. That file can be encrypted with any password you choose. That file can be called a **wallet**, which contains a seed which in turn is a list of private keys to sign transactions, or a master public key where you can't sign transactions, but you can create unsigned transactions to sign in another offline computer where you have already entered the seed or the private keys (that's called **cold storage**).
I recommend you to avoid keeping a wallet (with private keys) in your day to day pc. You can buy a hardware wallet, or keep only a read-only wallet and use cold storage.

The address is a hashed version of the public key with added validation checks (checksum), so if you accidentally change a character, the checksum won't be valid.
The public key do appear in the transaction. It's the only time when the owner of the private key reveal its public key to the public. The nodes then, can verify the transaction, meaning that as the transaction is signed by the owner of the private key (you need the private key to sign a transaction), it proves that is the real owner of the unspent outputs with funds pointing to that address.
I'm not an expert, but as long as I know is just like I described.

If I could talk to myself from 2013 I would say to me:
* 1. Learn how bitcoin works "[Mastering bitcoin]( from the great Andreas, is free. Also can get a deadtree version.
* 2. Don't leave your founds in the exchange. Or I will find you and stab you in the back. Read about hardware wallets, or the cheaper [airgapped wallets](
* 3. Understand that you have "invested" (I hate that word in the bitcoin space) in something that could change the world, not in a financial product.
* 4. If is dipping because MtGox, it will eventually go up. Don't loose faith. So don't panic sell (this is also applicable right now)
* 5. Put some money each month. Even just a little. Don't spend it in stupid things from amazon.

Because people/bad-actor can track how much bitcoin do you make, how much do you have, when people use bitcoin at your shop, etc. Example: "yesterday I saw your address, and I know anybody has bought anything yet in that address. If tomorrow someone buys you anything using that address, I will know". Using a different address for each payment, as long as you don't lost any of its private keys, is a better aproach, then I won't be able to track your coins, and the costs and fees are exactly the same.
In other words only use the same address if you don't care people knowing the bitcoin YOU have in that address.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:26:28
You should generate a payment address for each order. Reusing the same address is not a good idea.

Never listen to price predictions. When Bitcoin dropped from $1000 to $400 in early 2014 many "experts" were predicting Bitcoin in thousands (E.g.: [here]( and [here]( by the end of 2014. One year later, in 2015, it dropped to around $200.
I'm always bullish in the long term. But ignore price predictions from "experts" at your own peril.

My dear oompa loompa, math is betraying you. If one cent equals one Satoshi, then one Bitcoin equals one million USD. All the money in the world is measured in hundreds of trillions. If Bitcoin becomes the world currency, and used as a store of value, one Satoshi will be roughly equal to one dollar in current purchase power.

One USDT is supposedly backed by one USD. If it were backed by bananas there would be no problem at all. But USD is another thing (from the point of view of NYAG, the US goverment, their cronies, and their 12 aircraft carriers (thanks u/mustbemoney for pointing that one)).

I'm not sure if there are enough tether to buy up all the bitcoin until $1.1 million..
Oh wait! They are just printed from thin air, and used to prop up the prices in the exchanges that use USDT, with that fake money. Even worst that the yet already fake real dollar.
That's all about this huge rally that came out of no where. You guys are just focused on the price, and you don't even ask yourselves why this parabolic rise.
