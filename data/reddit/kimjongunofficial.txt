Why do people start spamming positive articles when bitcoin drops a significant amount? 
Bitcoin is done. No one is using it because they think it’s “going to the moon”. Once they realize it’s not going to $100K, they’re selling.

It can be both. Bitcoin is a scam and by no means is it a foreign exchange currency backed by governments or economies. 
And people think it’s limited and non-renewable (limited coins released). Renewable as In anyone that wants to make a cryptocurrency can do it if they wanted? Because that’s what’s going on. Lite coin, bitcoin, dogecoin etc. it’s a gimmick and they’re all backed by nothing.

Of what, exactly? A currency backed by government/economy/growth? Or a currency that people are investing in just because they think it’ll make them money? No one really cares about bitcoin. People are investing so they can convert it back to their own currency.

Thank you and this is exactly what I meant. Those who are the most “threatened” by bitcoin can easily shut it down. I think if governments shut bitcoin down years ago, there would have been an uproar. Instead, they’re pumping up the btc stock and making investors lose their shirts, hoping people would start to hate bitcoins on their own.

I knew a crash would happen the moment you assholes said bitcoin would hit $100K in a year (and some said $500K). Wtf are YOU smoking? You don’t think the price of bitcoin can be manipulated with $50 million? What about when banks and governments start using their money to rip off bitcoin investors the same way computers predict and rip off stock investors?

Then why are so many posts allowed telling people to hold their investments? You can’t pick and choose which posts to keep just because of your bias...
