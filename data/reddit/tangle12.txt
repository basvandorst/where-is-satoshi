As far as I know, no one accepts EFT unless its is done by wire due to chargebacks. Thats also why no one accepts PayPal and other like services that can be reversed.

The new debit card coming out form Bitinstant looks interesting. I think it will be a game changer for BTC 
@_date: 2012-08-24 04:46:19
Thanks. I just received my bitcoins. Happy camper :)

I cant loose on this bet. I have a mate that is paying 2 to 1 in my favour that he does pay so if I  put in a bet with Matthew I can now win no matter the outcome :). If pirate does pay I win 20BTC and if I put a 15BTC bet with Matthew I win 15 BTC if  he doesn't pay. No matter what the out come I make between 5 or 10 BTC.

Their customer service is horrible too. Sometimes it takes days to get a response and sometimes they never respond. I have never had to wait more than about 4 hours for MtGox to reply. Sorry Crypto X is Sh Dont get me wrong I am not a MtGox fan-boy either. They have their faults (especially for us Aussies), but if I had to choose, its not even a competition. If you are going to use an exchange to buy more than a $1000 worth of BTC MtGox is unfortunately only exchange to use at the moment, otherwise I use a local fixed price service in Aus

BitPiggy has had issues due to fraud. I personally use Bit Innovate  I have used them more than 5 times now and have been really happy with their service

Nice summary. I have used  a few times now and I have to say they are awesome! Best fixed price service I have used to date. I have always got my coins in less than 2 hours. Its good to see some new players in the Australian space. This will only help push the price down. Also they just reduced their price this week so it looks like this might already be happening

Hey has anyone used these guys yet to buy bitcoins in Australia? They seem like a new player, I have not seen them before.
@_date: 2012-08-24 05:17:08
It is still only the beginning. I think it is going to be interesting to see how this all unfolds. At the moment banks dont give a crap about BTC and they have no reason to. They can be late adopters and still crush everyone over night if they want to.

I processed an order earlier today and recieved my BTC about 30min ago. They were cheaper than MrBitcoin and spendbitcoin + I got an extra 2% because of some deal they are offering today. I also needed the bitcoins today so I could not use MtGox as last time it took 3 days for my funds to clear and I got charged something like $42 on a $250 transfer. It doesn't make sense on small orders and I don't have a few thousand to spare to get a cheaper rate. If anyone knows a better and faster way let me know? I think it was an alight deal. I got 19.40876655 for $200 AUD. If I sent my funds to MtGox I would have got only about 3/4 of that.

BFL has one of the worst customer service I have ever come across. I sent them 10 emails over 8 weeks and had only one reply and that was when I demanded a refund and for them to cancel my order. I now refuse to do any business with them even if I am cutting my nose of to spite my face. I feel that if they dont have the business acumen to respond to a simple email in an acceptable time frame, then how could they deliver on any other promises. 
@_date: 2012-08-26 07:43:16
First one was to check my order. The next few were about the ASICs and then because I was not hearing anything I started to get worried and asked them to confirm delivery date, then because I had still not heard back form them I ended up cancelling my order. I got a message back within 24 hours after stating I wanted to cancel and initiated a chargeback, but by then it was too late, they had dicked me around too much. I will GPU mine until it is no longer cost effective and then reassess.

Crypto x Change using AUD is pointless unless you are a seller. The price is so inflated there it is not funny. And like you said it is crazy slow. Sometime up to 5min per page load. I once put $800 in there and after 3 days I could not buy in AUD for anything under 20% over the MtGox price. Complete wast of time. I have now used spendbitcoins MrBitcoin and Bit Innovate.  is now my choice moving forward for buying in AUD or until I find something better
@_date: 2012-08-27 00:33:22
Do you plan on offering any other services so I can sell you my Bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-08-24 01:48:56
How does the special you are offering work? Do I get the bonus BTC after I pay or is it included in the rate displayed?
@_date: 2012-08-25 02:59:12
True. but you dont get positions like this often. Its not big money I will be winning but I like my chances 
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:05:42
Why do you guys ask for so much information and why do I have to give you my phone number? No other Bitcoin provider that I know of asks for this information
@_date: 2013-01-09 02:45:22
here is a list of places you can get free bitcoins.  
I agree with the others though if you are a programmer put your services up on  and see what you get back.
@_date: 2013-02-26 02:19:18
I have used them now many times and have been really happy with their service. I have had my bitcoins in my wallet every time within the hour. Sometime even before I get back from the bank
@_date: 2013-03-20 04:00:42
I can list about 10 sites that dont ask for this type of information. If fact almost all fixed priced exchanges dont ask for this info. Identifying yourself goes against everything bitcoin stands for
