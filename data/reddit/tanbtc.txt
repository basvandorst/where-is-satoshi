I tried it last Friday and there was this API problem. Now I'm trying to start my Ledger Wallet and get stuck at the syncing screen.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:20:01
Obviously not just 2 attempts. I tried if tens of times last week, several times today. I can also try another thousands of times, as you like.
Good to know your way of customer support.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:33:09
Ok, it's just stuck in the synchronising screen. I'll send you an email. Sorry for I lost my temper.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:07:52
Can you send bitcoins using it?
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:14:32
OK. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:40:19
But the problem is, other than the screenshot it's stuck, I can provide nothing. How do I see those logs?

Native Chinese in China here, I see there a lot of misunderstandings regarding Bitcoin in China, but seems it's very hard for people to know the situation here.
The first thing is that, China might be the most Bitcoin friendly place in the world, just imagine this: no strict verification on exchanges, no fees on most of the exchanges, and, you still can buy bitcoins via Alipay, the China Paypal.
The real concern for the China government is not Bitcoin, but some other pyramid schemes carrying under the name of Bitcoin. For instance, there's someone selling some crap coin called Vpal under the name of Bitcoin, a lot of people were scammed and keep on being scammed.
The finance regulation in China is not so prepared(or annoying) as in the States, so China government did regulate it in some aspect, like forbid exchanges accepting deposits directly.
I did some AMA about China [before]( which might be helpful.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:03:04
I think the price will keep on falling for a while, untill people acquire the antifragile ability.
Rumors are more reliable than some official news agencies in China, and since most people don't know about Bitcoin at all, it's very natural for them to believe it.
@_date: 2014-10-31 03:54:16
But how do these providers restrict simultaneous connections without logging?

Still it's much easier to trade bitcoins in China, until now on some website it's still very easy to buy and sell bitcoins using Alipay, the Chinese paypal.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:13:49
Yes they are.  Chinese citizens are able to partake in any legal goods transactions.

* Like 99.999% of other Chinese, I master nothing of martial art.

@_date: 2014-03-31 05:34:24
1. Bitcoin is more and more prevalent in mainstream media, though most are Ponzi talkers.
2. No, because it's very hard to initiate tor in China. Yes, the China government has the ability to even partially block tor.
3. I don't think the government is gonna regulate crypto-currencies in the near future.
4. None. I only see some badges made by a friend.
5. Regular Joes think is a pyramid scheme, which is prevailing in China.
6. Alipay and Tenpay are very prevalent in China. In fact, Alipay is kinda like Bitcoin because of the transaction is irreversible. Tenpay is ingrated to the most popular chat app Wechat so people can buy stuffs using their phone seamlessly. The biggest carrier China Mobile is promoting NFC but few people use, because it's still not convenient as Alipay even using NFC. There are not many NFC terminals in major cities.
7. There's an economics professor Wang Fuzhong(王福重) expressed some positive comments about bitcoin, but sorry, I can't find any English version of his opinion. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:39:17
First, what you read are just tabloid, Chinese media are unprofessional as hell, most of the presses have no understanding of bitcoin.
Second, the fact is against what the tabloids reporting.
They are not facing closure, if they are, actually it is a good news.

I don't think there's any black market accepting bitcoins.

No. Only mining rigs dealers accept bitcoin.

The constraints on speech is not that strict as described by the western media. People can make any speeches privately or publicly, they just cannot publish their opinions in any traditional media.
As for adopting democratic reform, as for as I can tell, most of people don't care about that.

It's only literally going, this topic is what the western media distort most.
People in the cities must abide to this policy, because the fine is heavy. But people in countries don't need to abide, since they have nothing to be fined. It's very common for any families in the countryside to have at least two children.
The lastest "one child" policy goes that, if both of the parents are single childs, they can have two children without being fined. In the near future, a couple can have two chilren if either of them is a single child.
You can see this policy is quite flexible, and people don't care much about it, after all, nowadays it's very expensive to raise a child even without this policy.

We've been using cash most of the time. I don't know when the RE bubble will pop, personally I think in 3~5 years.

It is legal to have USD in China, every Chinese citizen has a quota of exchanging 50K USD every year.
You are right, you cannot just divest all your investment, you can transfer a limited quota.
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:05:25
Generally you pay and it's OK. In big cities, people are not willing to give more birth, while in rural areas, it's very common to have more than one child. The policy is not well enforced, just like the ban on bitcoin.

Yes, Hong Kong has its own system, this structure is called "One Country, Two Systems", which was proposed by Deng Xiaoping agreeing Hong Kong goes with capitalism and the mainland keeps the China Characteristic Socialism.
Some people from Hong Kong are claiming that the Communist Party is manipulating Hong Kong's politics, but literally, Hong Kong has a democratic governing system.
It's very important regarding finance. In fact, Hong Kong's stance on finance is much different from the rest of China, that's why it's much easier to run an exchange in Hong Kong. The exchange 796 is runned by Chinese people but registered in Hong Kong.

The central bank never said it publicly, so that's why you still can buy bitcoins though wire transfer.
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:14:37
We don't repair this, because it's very cheap, just buy a new one.

It not at all. Just keep calm and eat a pie.
Until now, there's not just a voucher system on exchanges, people can still use wire transfer.
That's how things in China work.

It's quite possible to live in China without knowing any Chinese, especially in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
In these cities it's very easy to deal with officials, cops and clerks too. If you choose to live in a smaller city, good luck.

It's hard to tell you in a tl;dr. But so far as I know, most of the people's understanding about China is wrong.

It's very simple, just use cash. Credit cards only got prevailing ten years ago.
