Why wouldn't US residents be allowed to sell them?
Would they be allowed to buy them?

My crypto funds are STILL frozen because of $36 USD that they need to verify through Synapsepay. 
BTW, US customers with USD through Synapsepay did not receive ANY haircut on the USD. I can confirm this on my account as all my USD was wired to my account automatically.

So... Think this through:
Non-us customers may be able to offload these tokens for a greater than zero value, potentially coming out with diminished losses if it drops to zero and bfx is bankrupted.
If US customers derive no immediate real world value from your token, this scenario seems pretty unfair to that group of customers. Pretty sure your socialization of losses across assets is illegal, but this reinforces it a bit. If your token represented any legitimate value, it would be legally tradeable. The scenario you guys proposed may be similar to bankruptcy liquidation, but that would be done via a third party through court proceedings. As it stands you have no legal standing to steal and reallocate customer assets independently. You guys are most likely going to be bankrupt, but this move increases the likelihood you end up in prison.

Compared to spending hours at a brick and mortar bank, yes.
The fact is, that stuff is not optional. They have to comply with AML/KYC laws. Thats the cost of legitimacy. Thats how we can be in the headlines and not have it only be about buying drugs online or evading taxes. For that, yes, definitely minimal hassle.

From your standpoint, withdrawing $1000 is the same as $100k. On Kraken, for example, with top tier verification, you can withdraw $100k per day ($500k per month, I think, but you can request more). 
Initiate a $100k withdrawal, it pops in your bank in a day or two. Do that daily if you need to withdraw several hundred thousand. Your bank should not have any issues, but if you’re in this situation, you damn sure better have it accounted for on your taxes.

Why does Core not have someone positioned to counter some of this garbage? 
To hear the BCash folks tell it, Core is some monolithic group of corporate shills and banker overlords. Obviously not the case if there isn’t a single person in a suit speaking proper English that’s able to go on the news circuit and at least maintain an illusion of “two sides”
Maybe the Blockstream folks could muster up someone to counter some of the FUD. Lightning is kind of pointless if traffic and capital migrates to BCash before it’s released.

No, you’re right. I’m not assigning blame anywhere in particular. Those things exist because demand made them profitable. 
Speaking for myself personally though, I can empathize and I have come to feel a tinge of revulsion at the pile of mostly useless garbage on display in these places.

BCash is high and btc just dipped, seems like a good trade, sure.

That place has gotten incredibly toxic as the market has spoken more and more clearly against bch. Looking at the &lt;0.1 ratio, I have to remember that a lot if the saltiness is coming from people who dumped btc at ~$6k and bought more bch at ~$2k.... its gotta be pretty hard to delude yourself at this point that that was a good decision.
My policy on forks is to hodl ALL of them. Im hodling ETC from prefork that was worth $0.5 at the time. Just hold it, ignore it, let the children fight. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:18:14
Even still, if the taxable event was the fork itself, at the moment of the fork, bch was worth $0. You “received” that asset at the moment of the fork, and at that moment bch was worth nothing.

I laughed because it was kind of true for me.... right after the election I decided it was time to move big on Bitcoin. I can imagine a world where btc and other cryptos are ubiquitous fulfill the promise of “web 3.0”
For now though, as a real world use case Bitcoin is a hedge against chaos.... wars, corruption, hyperinflation, famine, you name it. That was the bet I made at least.

The thing is, people are often wrong in both directions.
It starts rising rapidly and they fomo into it, often enter before it corrects back down a bit. When it drops, the sit with a finger on the trigger and second guess the “bottom” until, often it bounces right back to where it was. Seen so many “missed the dip” type posts with that.

To comply with KYC/AML laws (know your customer, anti-money laundering). Most legitimate exchanges are going to do their best to not run afoul of that stuff. Keep in mind that if they do, depending on where they’re based, a government crackdown on an exchange that is not in compliance might get shuttered and assets frozen, possibly for quite some time.

Sell a couple to cover your principle, taxes, and buy yourself something nice, something you’ll see and use and appreciate on a daily basis. Hodl the rest and set a new target price/timeline for any future profit taking. The roller coaster will be far less nauseating.

If you’re looking at a gpu rig for alts, that might be possible (more than $200, but possible) For bitcoin, any cpu/gpu mining will yield almost nothing, even over the span of years at this point.
If you look at ASICs, right now this is roughly what you can expect:
Antminer S7 ($1200 on Amazon): 0.015 btc/month
Antminer S9 ($4400 on Amazon): 0.05 btc/month
That’s very rough numbers for RIGHT NOW. They will decrease dramatically over time. 18 months ago my s7s produced 0.1 btc every 10 days ($20 value at the time). Now, that quantity would take about six months.

2048 words on the list right? If they knew it was the last word missing, I bet it could be brute-forced. If you omitted a word somewhere in the middle (say, on a number meaningful to you), I guess that would be orders of magnitude more difficult.
Sn alternative would be using a passphrase, basically a 25th word (of your choice) that unlocks secondary wallets behind the seed phrase. On a ledger wallet, you can link the passphrase wallets with an alternative pin code.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:52:58
Oh absolutely. I’m not suggesting that Coinbase or any exchanges are doing anything not on the level. I see that kind of stuff mentioned frequently with Airdrops and forks.... even with the BCash stuff, Coinbase made their position clear ahead of time that they weren’t distributing BCash or supporting it. The fact that people ultimately got it should be seen as a gift and an exception. As far as Bitcoin Gold/Diamond/B2x, Ethereum Fog and whatever else comes out month after month, don’t hold your breath. 
If you want that stuff for certain, keep it in your own wallet. If you don’t want to maintain a wallet, then maybe consider keeping it in Binance exchange.

While correct usage, sometimes people throw around “speculating” as a derogatory term, conflating it with just plain gambling.
The difference with speculation on stocks is that if I told someone I bought shares of Tesla, while there is reasonable discussion to be had on whether they are over/undervalued and future profitability, Im probably not going to have any calling me an idiot (or a lucky idiot) or engaging in any ad hominem attacks based on that speculative vehicle.

Yeah, no kidding. But in that case, no cryptocurrency is peer to peer, as we’re all interacting with a blockchain.
When I used to have an ftp server of pirated mp3s, that was peer to peer. BitTorrent is peer to peer. 
The point is, the only relevant point, is that the end result is peer to peer in all of these cases.The idea that segwit or lightning disrupts some existential element of bitcoin just seems ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:52
Second highest tier (tier 3 i think, allows for like $10k/$25k) is the normal kind of id verification, passport, selfie, etc. After you get that, you can apply for top tier by filling out a form asking about employment, income, other financial questions. The whole process can take a few weeks if they’re backed up. Im familiar with Kraken, but i would guess that coinbase and gemini are similar. Bottom line: whether you’re looking to cash in a hundred or a million in usd, you can do it with really very minimal hassle. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:16:20
Agreed, fees are currently a problem. 
However, the examples this guy cites are not typical of what you’d see if you choose to utilize segwit. Additionally, Ver claims that Core devs want the fees to be where they are, which is pretty disingenuous.
Everything else is him spreading FUD and shilling his altcoin to a panel of nontechnical journalists.

That’s actually good to hear. “Bad” coverage like that based mostly on punditry may scare away a few “investors” that are better off not in this space.

Not sure about Texas, but I believe they have to get some kind of licensing in each state they have customers. A year or so ago when I signed up they didn’t offer services in my state and it just let me get “preverified” until they got whatever licensing they needed. Not sure if thats the case, but may be limitations based on state of residence.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:51:22
Meanwhile, more and more people piling into coinbase and other exchanges, getting verified and wiring money in, many of them thinking the same thing: “I’m ready to buy as soon as it drops a little”
No telling how that goes.
My guess: As soon as another run up makes an appearance, even a smallish one, people will FOMO into that so hard that it makes for an abrupt and wild swing (sharply up, followed buy a sharp correction)

Andreas? 
The issue/problem, if you will, is that BTC doesn’t have someone with as direct an agenda as as Ver/Jihan &amp; co. To me, that’s a feature and not a bug.
Where that does become a problem is when the lay public conflates BCash with Bitcoin... Problems &amp; scams with BCash get lumped into the same pot, potentially affecting larger adoption. Of course, slowing down adoption a bit might be healthy at this point.

Been wondering the same. The BCH folks seem to be particularly frothy about this... talking conspiracy with Tether &amp; Bitfinex. A lot of posts on this were right after the failed attempt at BTC/BCH flippening.
The suggestion seems to be that newly minted tether is not backed by USD as its supposed to be... I just don’t see how that could be proven without a full audit. 
On the contrary, anyone that recently jumped out of BTC to BCH has seen some significant paper losses. I could see how alleging the BTC price rise to be “fake” would be appealing.

I have two of them that have been running for about 18 months.... I believe at this point its taking almost 3 months to generate 0.1 btc. Last spring i was getting 0.1 btc/week. 
I get free electricity (condo garage), but if I was paying for them Im not sure they would be profitable at this point. 
Also, if I had taken that same couple thousand usd 18 months ago and just bought btc @ ~$250, netting, say, 8 btc and hodled, Id have gotten a wayyyy higher return than the maybe 2 or so btc that Ive generated in this time.

Exactly. Should be simple with a few transactions. If you have a bunch, you can import wallet data to bitcoin.tax as well as exchange data and it will put it together in an 8949 form for IRS.
In your example.... say you bought 1 btc for $1k, then when btc was worth $10k, you used 0.1 btc on a $1k-equivalent purchase. The taxable event was you buying the $1k item, and your gains would be $900
