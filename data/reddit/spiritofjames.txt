They tried. The only reason it wasn't forced on everyone on the BTC network is because of the fork that you call crap. 
Yet I'm pretty sure you couldn't get five words into an actual description of why any given Bitcoin fork is better or worse than another without falling back on ridiculous adhominem nonsense.

The DAA has been changed. Tell me why it matters anymore. Bitcoin has had many periods with relatively poor code and/or software design as it has grown. Why should one example like that disqualify a project entirely, especially after it's been successfully replaced?


That's simply false. Bitcoin is at heart an economic design that could and does have many possible implementations. Nobody would have bought into Bitcoin as just some software. In fact Satoshi need not have coded anything at all.

Don't conflate block size and block weight. Segwit allows for heavier blocks, but the block "size" is still capped at 1MB. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:37:41
No, it's obvious most users don't want segwit because most users don't USE segwit....
Nothing you posted about BCH is in any way relevant to this conversation.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:23:13
That is *a* problem, but I disagree that it is the primary problem.
The primary problem is that BTC has been capped arbitrarily against the needs and wishes of the vast majority of its current and potential users.
It's absurd to pretend that Segwit is or was universally desired, so it is just as absurd to pretend that it is somehow the users' fault that BTC isn't scaling when the devs make Segwit the only viable channel for scaling. The devs knew that not everybody was on board with Segwit. So why did they try to force everyone to use it? Isn't that against the entire philosophy of Bitcoin? There were multiple options for scaling, and instead of leaving it to the market to decide, they forced it against the wishes of most of the market. And then to top it off they complain about people not adopting what they try to force on everyone, when they knew full well that many if not most people didn't want it, weren't ready for it, etc..

There needs to be nothing more said in that regard.

Please tell me how any democracy is compatible with "free association." Two wolves vote to eat the sheep - does the sheep get to secede? If so, then when does democracy actually accomplish anything other than exclude those the majority would like to exploit?


I'm not getting into a pissing contest over definitions - I'll only say that it's been over a hundred years since these words were used how you want to use them outside of hardcore marxist academe. If you insist on archaic definitions, fine - I'm against both of these as well, with some caveats.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:08:03
No it's not, not at all. Work is not property - the *results* of work are. Work is an abstract concept signifying the expenditure of time and energy. Merely spending time and energy does NOT necessarily create anything, much less anything of value, so obviously Work != Property. Property is what is derived *from* work, the tangible, physical results. Information is not and cannot be property any more than any abstraction can be.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:13:47

You're evading my question - isn't direct democracy entirely *against* "free association"? What if I disagree with the majority?
These two sentences -


are directly contradictory. Democracy incentivizes everyone to "fuck everyone else over" as often as they can. If you're the majority you have carte blanche - the true war of all against all. Many ancaps, including myself, insist on universal (human) rational ethics that entirely eschews coerced democratic organization as the minority is always reduced to sub-human status. Cooperation doesn't require "democracy," in fact "democracy" is anti-cooperation in any state of dischord (ie non-unanimity). 
Further, I have to ask about this: 


Who is "you"? What is the mechanism by which you will remove competition (in other words, *choice*) from consumers? How can this be done without creating what you say you oppose: namely, hierarchy and/or the State?

So...... when someone uses your favorite color, they owe you? I don't think you understand what property is about: it's not attribution. Attribution and property rights are very different, though related in our minds intuitively. Property only exists as a means of negotiating scarce resources that are being competed for.

If you want to understand the anarchist position, every time you ask yourself how something can be done, just ask one additional question: does this idea *require* compulsion in order to work?
The first time you answer yes to this question, stop yourself and realize you probably are jumping to conclusions. Take some time, take a breath, and spend a few minutes imagining how you, a group of your friends, a neighborhood group, a community club, a charity, a business, etc. *might* approach the issue. If you can imagine something approaching a solution being arrived at without compulsion being involved, try imagining another. You will be surprised how many alternatives you can come up with.
Personally there are no longer any situations that I can imagine compulsion being *required* beyond *immediate and direct physical defense of myself or another.* This is one of the reasons I am an anarchist; it really just means that I believe that people can cooperate without being forced to do so. Moreover I would claim that if something *requires* compulsion to be put into place, it is very likely an inefficient, incorrect, and/or immoral practice. Good ideas will be persuasive. Bad ideas, incomplete ideas, or self-serving ideas generally won't be.

Uh... you realize that the "capitalism" in ancap refers to "all voluntary actions" right? That is, what you're arguing is almost *exactly* what capitalism means to an ancap. The only stricture you are under as far as obtaining your livelihood goes is to not aggress against others or their justly held possessions, at least as far as possible.


If you can secede/ignore the democratic processes, then eventually most if not everyone will opt out and you're left with [autarchy]( the preferred system of ancaps... I really think  you're just too blinded by a lot of anti-ancap propaganda from or something. If you want, just call us voluntarists and we would all fit together.

"Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)
Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.
That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.
But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia."

Again... the "government" doesn't exist in the same way "The Church" doesn't exist. In fact "Wal-Mart" doesn't exist either: these words are just mental shorthand for groups of individual people and their property. It's important to say this because if you allow yourself to think about it in some abstract, psuedo-religious manner its contradictions and absurdities become less clear.
It's absurd that any human being claims for themselves special status entitling them to countermand/overrule other people's rights. And that's all a government is, a group of people who do so.

Actually, no. They get their authority by consent of those they arbitrate for, just like any other legitimate authority. The whole problem of using words like "collective will" or "sovereign" is that they mask the fact that their actions are performed without the consent of the involved parties.

Classical socialism, yes. But Marxism and modern socialism call for a temporary "dictatorship of the proletariat," a co-opting of State/violent power in order to enforce their utopian vision. This is, of course, a horribly mistaken position, and it seems now to be inextricably bound up in modern "socialism," as evidenced by the statements of people like Noam Chomsky, for example.
I do agree, however, that the 19th-century, pre-Marxian, Proudhonian concepts of anarchy are very much in line with "anarcho-capitalism" (or voluntarism) - the major differences lie in economic arguments made by Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and the Austrians (which most left-anarchists I've met have no conception of whatsoever), and merely semantic issues on definitions of "property."

I'm not sure why a monopoly on justice services can be seen as "protecting rights." If they were truly protecting rights they would not insist on their monopoly status. In fact I would suspect that they were in the business of doing something quite different from offering justice in that case.


I'm not sure how or why the religious ritual called "election" actually confers special authorities and powers on someone. As far as I can tell two people don't magically gain anything by the mere virtue of being more than one. Ethics exists independent from majority will.


Yes, because all existing "governments" are funded by force. Being a government agent is working for the biggest mafia that exists.

For now - but what if they let you pay with bitcoin (and thus pseudonymously)? 


And isn't this just another part of being anonymous - ie, not presenting information to the government that would prompt an audit, or even changing your identity?

Google will send you to a lot of low-quality synopses and analysis on both sides of the issue. Wikipedia is notorious for its biased and obviously uninformed pages, as an example.
If you're actually intrigued, I recommend the first 50-100 pages of *Human Action,* by Ludwig von Mises, to get a real understanding.

See... that's fine for you. I have no problem if you and yours want to hire/assign somebody to act as your representative, attorney, etc... what I have a problem with is when this is forced on the hobo, me, or other people who prefer a different agent/agency. 
You may see a difference between the government agent and the hobo, but I don't - actually, I also see a difference, but in my eyes the hobo is the honest person worthy of praise and trust, while the government agent is a thief.

It's not difficult at all when you have a source of funds that is untraceable and untouchable. How can you be tracked outside of some kind of national face-recognition system without money trails?
I'm not saying you're being paranoid, I'm saying I think you grossly overestimate the reach of the government, and miss how relatively helpless they are to stop things like piratebay/bittorrent, 4chan, Tor, bitcoin, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-20 22:59:10


What about businesses that emerge if/once bitcoin becomes our standard currency? If they're not already registered/licensed with the government, couldn't they operate anonymously, just like Silkroad? And isn't that inevitably more profitable in the long run?
I think part of the appeal of bitcoin is that - in the very long run - business will finally become almost entirely unregulatable: Short of physical inspection of property, anyway, and even that will present innumerable hurdles to government agencies (just think about how difficult it is to prosecute mob-type "fronts"). During the transition period, when you have businesses under the old system basically adopting bitcoin in their middle-age (so to speak), they can't help their identity already being out. But new businesses that start up using bitcoin could defy any and all government interference and would *undoubtedly* outcompete those that are hampered by it. This would then lead, over time, to the old businesses either adapting to perform similarly or going out of business.

One thing I don't understand is this concept of regulating bitcoin. Let's say everyone goes through the necessary procedures to be 99.99% anonymous - how can any of it be regulated by some central authority anymore than Tor or Piratebay?

There is always a point where direct defense is necessary, under any system or arrangement. If a person refuses to ever speak or cooperate with anyone, refuses arbitration services, etc, and yet continues to act violently, people have the right to defend themselves with proportionate force.
Also be aware that private security exists even in today's market dominated by force-funded police organizations. Without that drain on the public, the price of private security would undoubtedly be lower, not to mention that they would very likely not have to chase down non-violent "criminals" such as drug users, further decreasing costs. In a free society (what I would call an anarchist society), security would be offered by a vast number of organizations just like fire insurance or home insurance or any number of other types of private firm, and it can all be done cooperatively, with the consent of everyone involved.

You're not paying attention. You're suddenly upset about a scenario where a violent offender refuses security or arbitration services? You're upset because people will defend themselves against this person?
This is like being upset about people who don't have car insurance wrecking into someone. You should first be worried about the victims, not the perpetrator.
