Feel so bad because I got family into it, and they purchased ~$1000 at $14,990. I'm making sure they hodl, because it is in my wallet for now. But I know this has to be freaking them out.
Bottom line, just hodl.

Just tried the number, went through 3 levels of choices, getting to the PR department, only to have the call shut off mid computer lady sentence.
They don't give a fuck.

Isn't this the high level example Andreas has been using for awhile?

Not worried. Just 1st world problems of convenience. :)

Those are the two main sticking points on why some people are following BCash. They are also the main talking points of the BCash "owners" (Craig, Roger, falkvinge).
Scaling issues are complex problems that cannot be fixed by the band-aid of "bigger-blocks". BCash will run into the same problem down the line if they get utility enough to garner popular usage. And if they continue to raise block size to achieve these two points that OP stated, they will run themselves out of existence with an unmanagable blockchain size.
OP is making comment against Bitcoin with the typical Narrative of BCash supporters. Thus the response from assumes OP is Shilling BCash. 's assumption, right or wrong, are legitimate concerns over the motives of the BCash fork as a whole.
If I fed the troll, oh well. If your question was honest in its intention, then I hope I connected some dots for you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:22:51
It implies that the fix for scalability will not be an on-chain solution.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:42:58
So there was some other "transaction" for the 0.000347 mixed with mine? That is weird.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:50:48
Are you saying for me to purchase coins from GDAX and not from Coinbase? Setup an account and use them instead?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:16:53
Makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to indulge me.
One more. :D


You mean as far as the exchange is concerned? Or for anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:15:11
I jumped the gun. Yeah, I got the right amount with the agreed transaction fee.
What through me off was [this.](
The output was higher than what I was sending. So there's a new question. What was 0.008536 doing in my transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:43:11
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:29:26
Way too business of a company. Dress slacks and collared shirts only. I normally get a chance to chit-chat with them somewhat, I just wish I could leave them with more info, aside from just telling the, "Google bitcoin for more info."
Most of them haven't even heard of BTC before, so I doubt they'd even remember the name to google.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:06:51
Maybe "article responses"? :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:01:56
Cool that it was being discussed, but what is the point?

Wow, only 22 votes in my state...

Added thoughts.
Though the cash part of crypto-currencies may not be a big deal to you, it will be to many people. Allowing for purchasing of web-based goods without the need of a bank is something that many poorer nations would love to have.
Also allowing for cash type transactions while not being stored in physical form is also a huge step up, not just for consumers, but for retailers as well. Why is it that on top of taxes (which everyone has to do), a retailer must be forced to pay transaction fees to a card company, just to do credit/debit transactions? True it is their network, and they are allowed to charge whatever they want for it. However, this is a middle-man getting rich scheme that should no longer needed. That is good news for both the retailer and the consumer. retailer has more profit, thus they can have more inventory, both stock *and* variety.
Something else that seems to be missing from your article is the understanding that mining isn't just "printing money" as you put it. Mining is the process that writes the public ledger that allows this whole process to work. Discovered blocks are what pay out, but those blocks are also a list of transactions which is the whole point to this technology. So once all of the coins have been mined, miners will still be needed to keep transactions going. Transaction fees will still be something that miners get to collect as they discover blocks. At that point, mining hardware would probably drop drastically in price, but people would still be willing to invest in mining hardware, because they get paid to help keep the network up. So mining, quite literally, can never be "on its way out".
Finally, what you flat out don't seem to understand is how this **IS** revolutionary. Not as much on the currency side (which is still big), but on the software side. What this technology has helped to create and answer can be applied to more than just currency. Sure, money is what people are running it up as now. But developing a software that allows for millions of people to agree on something (in this case it is the validity of the blockchain) without having to place trust in one another is a huge deal. People lie, Governments lie, Businesses lie, and most of them do it because they can hide behind closed doors. Because this is all out in the open, it started out difficult, and becomes ever increasingly so, to manipulate things into your own favor. Now imagine using this same kind of system for things that many are constantly afraid of being manipulated. Voting, Stocks, organization of a business. These are some of the many things discussed here, on this subreddit, which are very likely to evolve out of this technology.
You seem to like to drive the point home about how it would not be a big enough change for you, swapping from current banking to crypto. Maybe this could help. Imagine, instead of having to pay fees to your bank, many of which are just to have an account with them, your money is literally in your possession. Stored away where *you* have access to it 24/7. You won't have any overage fees, you won't have any minimum balance required, you won't get dinged a high percentage of a transaction moving cash from one account to another. More of your money stays in your pocket, because you're not paying someone to store it for you. Granted there are the transaction fees associated with sending and receiving coin. But in the long run, you are spending far less than what a bank will gouge you for.
Sorry for wall of text.

Very cool idea, but that screen change between apps/tools is nauseating. Will that be going away or is that one of the hindrances of using e-ink?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:44:18
Wow, that is some straight up thievery by your banking system. Who the hell let that robbery become legal?

You guys may want to redo some of your checkout software logic. You had me complete an order before you requested the BTC Payment. On top of which, the address generator did not work.
I planned on only seeing the BTC price in the shopping cart, but was taken straight through to order number.
This will probably leave you guys with many dead or orphaned orders as people like to price the item in BTC before purchase.

It's not quite logical, to me, that there wasn't a single public figure on the side of your people who would have stopped this. Sure, the USA is sliding down a slippery slope of bull shit and collapse, but there would be full on war if we were ever told that our money was no longer "legally" our money if stored in a bank.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:25:14
Wow, hey sorry if I inflected any tone of anger to you. I was not trying to incite a fight. I was truly asking, was there no one in Parliament (is that the correct term?) that fought against that law going through? I'll be happy to discuss and/or debate some of the points you brought up, if you really are looking for that. I was just trying to understand further how you got to that state of law.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:03:10
It does not count after the first time. I think it may change *your* vote, but not add to the total.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:08:43
Then I must ask. If you learned a lot about bitcoin from posting this article, why didn't you take the time to learn about it **before** the article? That's just journalistic malpractice, unless you were simply looking to drive page views by stating an unpopular *opinion*. You have seriously hurt your own credibility by just posting the article.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:34:25
Aaaaaand it's gone.

Wouldn't the issue be that everyone would drop the coin if they see these companies mass-farming then hoarding their stock?
True, there is nothing stopping them from using the hardware themselves, and they probably do have a few for the companies' benefit (a guess, but not an illogical one). But I would assume there would be a mass exodus from Bitcoin support if it was found that Butterfly or KNC were mass mining for their own riches.
So the ASIC manufacturers understand this, maybe? And see that in the long run, they make more money by decentralizing the tech, instead of hoarding.
That's my 2 cents.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:37:37
Actually, was that not part of the original plan? Digital currency to replace everyday use of Credit/Debit Cards and Fiat cash?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:24:20
I fail to see, even with your imgur screen grab, where they say "are done". Sensationalizing a bit much?

E-mail gave me no recourse through support.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:38:00
No worries. And yeah, that was kind of why it lead me to ask the question in the first place.
They didn't say I did anything wrong, or there was anything wrong with my account.
They didn't say I needed to do anything more than what I already did.
They just said, "Sorry, your transaction was cancelled. We hate that it happens sometimes, but it does." and left it at that. Basically a "tough titty" statement with no recourse.
I was just curious if they did it to anyone else over the course of this rise to near $700.
Thanks for the well wishes, and no worries on the arse making. We all do it sometimes. No worries.

I will admit, I have not stayed on top of bitcoin news, except price and basic surface info. What has happened with Coinbase that merits this angst?
(Not mocking, I seriously don't know. I just have this account with them from a long while ago.)

Do you have an article for the other side, that I may compare?
(This is more just to learn the arguments. I am on the side of BTC. I just don't get the new segwit drama.)
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:04:50
Thanks for the correction.
As far as the hardware, I do not dabble with enough to justify that right now. Someday, when the kids are less expensive or out of the house. But for now, I just get $20-30USD ever month or so, then spend it on hobby stuff I planned to purchase anyway. Buying when coins are lower then buying stuff when coins are higher.
I will be propper hodling this small investment soon enough though. After the Aug 1st shake-up settles.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:54:04
Isn't this a bigger problem though? It doesn't look like a 3rd party phishing attempt. The URLs look like they are coming directly from this "legitimate" company.
