It’s not on youtube, atleast not for free. Is the link not working?
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:44:03
I don’t know what other strategy you want to hear other than invest more money. Just put money every week or month into btc.

Yeah man I wouldn’t take any chances. You don’t know how sophisticated scams can be nowadays.
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:45:02
It’s stock had been down over 60% from it’s IPO price for the last 2 years. It’s recovering but The company shows no signs of rapid growth and they are losing users left and right. It needs to be acquired by a company soon. They aren’t profitable. Tons of top executives have left Snap. They have to fix their shit ASAP because 2020 will be miserable for them if they stay where they are at. Hopefully the CEO starts managing things right.

Why the fuck are you asking for advice then dismissing all the warnings people tell you? You keep trying to justify it. You deserve to be scammed if you use it man.
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:57:28
Ok well I’m a beginner as well. That’s the only advice I can give you personally. Other than that- wait for responses or do research on your own as well.
You have to go down the rabbit hole to find out everything about bitcoin.

Can someone explain what’s going on? I want to participate
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:18:02
I’m using tZero currently,  and wdum it’s not a wallet? Isn’t it a mobile wallet? Just not as secure as hardware wallets?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:16:42
I’m just a noob, so I’m guessing if I put 50$ in when it’s at 11k that means I’m losing money as opposed to going in with $100 when it’s at 10.9k? Is it that big of a difference?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:11:42
Damn, why so sure?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:20:32
Can‘t buy crypto through it though right? Where do you guys buy crypto if mobile apps aren‘t as secure?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:18:53
Perfect, thanks! How’s your btc career since you’ve been at it 8 years? Profitable?
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:20:55
Thanks, that will be my hardware wallet for sure
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:12:31
What about for iphone? And I plan on getting a hardware wallet , would I be able to transfer my btc to the hardware wallet from the app?
