"A single address, which is a suspected change collector for making BTC payments to Huobi, has liquidated more than 22,000 BTC in November alone, averaging at little over 1100 BTC per day."

Your comment answers your question. Why? -- because, sir, curiosity
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:53:21
It's not about mining using pen and paper. It's about being inquisitive and interested in the lower level of the tech which people usually ignore.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:52:06
I'm all in for MASSIVE scaling, sound code, and decentralization.
I don't think this is anti-development, I read somewhere a website call it. I shared my feeling that I never found discussions here to be anti-development anytime.
I'm new to this and as an old guy here you can understand how complex understanding this debate/war can get. Does this subreddit support Segwit? From what I've read about LiteCoin, all I know is Segwit can help make transactions much faster but would result in lower fees for miners.
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:12:39
I only realized the value of Bitcoin when I was having a discussion with my cab driver, he told me he had only one bank account which was blocked by the bank for some stupid reason, and when that account was blocked for 3 weeks - he ended up taking a loan to pay for his expenses. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:14:13
So what is the empty bucket they stand in front of?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:47:17
I understand it would solve problem to some extent. I assume activating Segwit to be a soft-fork. Does r/bitcoin support Segwit or something else? 
What are cons of Segwit?

I have two uncofirmed transactions where I paid 120 sat/byte , both are of $200 each.
I know I paid a less fees, should I expect a refund in 7 days from sending date?

From viabtc site :=
The following article cites many specific examples of the rampant censorship on the "r/bitcoin" sub-reddit:
A (Brief and Incomplete) History of Censorship in r/bitcoin, by John Blocke
As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
By unsubscribing to and subscribing to sub-reddit you take a stand against censorship.
By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic, you are casting a vote against the current development team.
There are currently several other cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin. The only remaining qualities that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies are its first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:44:13
Who backs core dev team and who backs bitcoin unlimited dev team?
This rise of fees is getting meteoric, Bitcoin being a gateway to crypto-universe should be easy to purchase. The only reason I picked Bitcoin to buy other cryptos was that exchanges in my country only sell Bitcoin , but with this I soon expect some low fees crypto to take over soon and be gateway and we'll have new exchanges popping up in no time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:58:58
Not sure why you guys would call me a troll. I have zero fucks to give about anything. I'm only annoyed because my 100$ transaction is pending since 2 days and trying to find answers. 
You know where did I learn about this subreddit division? It was when I googled for bitcoin transaction accelerator, and on top was link of viabtc and on click of that, they made me read a big document sharing this story.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:57:22
Can you just PM me whats happening? I don't get it honestly..

what do you mean by fake convo, huh
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:01:53
Q1) If Segwit increases transaction throughput - how does that not make transaction faster? Does that mean twice the size of block would also take twice the time it currently takes? Would it not pave way for better mining equipment suitable for larger blocks?
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:52:30
Let's discuss it on r/btc as well. They claim they don't censor.
