How does changetip work with named objects? For example I've seen people say tip 1 coffee etc. How do you tie a tip to an object and set the price of said tip?

If you have access to another computer you can download a live linux distro and install to a usb.  Boot the broken computer from the USB ( you may have to change boot order in the BIOS) and simply copy your wallet from there.  I'm sure I've made this sound more complicated then it is. It's actually really simple.

Have you actually tried though? I saw a thread where there were a couple of Australians saying Circle worked for them.

All the accounts posting here have little to no comment history and have joined within the last few hours. Caution is advised.

If you can "remember" your BIP38 key you're doing it wrong.

OP's address does not show that amount. The gold appears to be real though. Thank you kind sir!

Blockchain says otherwise, but I applaud the drunken thought you showed that young man.

The only way I could see you sending to an incorrect address is if you tried to type out the address by hand. Trying to type out an address by hand while drunk is just a recipe for disaster. Your wallet will still have a record of the actual address you sent too though. 
6.66 btc seems like a lot to just give out on a whim however so color me skeptical.

Would love to get this running on a Raspberry Pi

Looks like somebody is trying track them.  0.000666 is being sent to each deposit address. Weird.

Do these virtual cards work behind a VPN?

Expedia accepts bitcoin through Coinbase. Does this mean that they’ll need to find a new payment processor also?

As far as I’m aware yeah it’s only for hotel payments.

If he was Satoshi it would have been much simpler to just move the coins and include the message "hey guys its me Craig Wright" in the transaction.

It says it in like the second paragraph of the article.

Maximum passphrase length is 50. I determined this by inspecting the page source on MyTrezor. Actually determining the passphrase length you used is a whole other kettle of fish and might not be possible.
EDIT: This [might help you]( recover your wallet. I would advise inspecting the source yourself though.

MultibitHD should be able to import the BreadWallet seed.

I can't watch the video because it was blocked on copyright grounds, but was it the orange van at the start of the episode? 
I saw the bitcoin logo.
