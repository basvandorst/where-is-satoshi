I didn't use it, I decided that I needed to research more, about the machine and bitcoins in general. I have never used bitcoins and the last thing I remember hearing was an episode in Planet Money about it, and a bit I read about its volatility. Furthermore, I don't think there are many places where they accept bitcoin around here. But curiosity has won over and I will be returning next week to get some bitcoins! I am still deciding on an amount and between using an app to save my bitcoins or do it the original way.

I didn't know they existed until I saw it. Cool stuff, I was a bit hesitant to use it.

I'm not to sure what that means as I haven't used bitcoins before. I'm going next week to get some, tough, so I should know by then. Getting myself informed right now.

Currently I'm working in Singapore, and back home is Panama, and some small town in Panama.

Yup, there is a how-to stuck on the machine, pretty easy, thing is, only a few hours ago I got my bit coin wallet thanks to @_date: 2014-11-02 10:32:39
Sadly all those are in the capital, about 5 hours from where I stay. It's cool anyway, I have a system that has worked well so far, thanks for all the help.

Cool pic, that's a pretty good queue, too bad when I was there no one used it, and I was there for quite a while, reading up on it.

Thanks for the wallet app suggestion and the tip!
Holy crap, this is pretty cool. I think the only issue people would have is changing it back to common currency so I can't just use this to send money back home.
