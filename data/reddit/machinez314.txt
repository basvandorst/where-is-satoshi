It takes 30 panels to power a miner. It costs 25x the amount of solar investment compared to mining equipment. Pay for the power or take the money and buy Bitcoin straight up. Solar mining is not a good use of capital. It is very good for the environment. But better suited to household use.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:30:41
More like 1.2m-1.6m depending on panels, inverter, pitch, mountings. 50% more than that if not grid tied and using battery backup.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:26:38
Land is not even the question. The panels cost a tremendous amount of money in relation to a miner. Upwards of 40:1 ratio (installed with supportive hardware). If you were bullish on Bitcoin mining, you'd be hampering returns by allocation 25-40x the resources on solar panels which are a 7-15 year ROI vs as low as 3-4 months on a miner.
If you found a place with 2-3 cent per KWH, payback on solar is 40-50 years which exceeds the systems lifetime.

Outside from a couple big blockers with 9 figures to sling around, most big blockers don't hold much crypto at a given time. This is why they will never understand the security the SoV folks covet. This will attract more SoV newcomers (with many multiples of value coming in than transactors) who have other means to transact. No possible way for them to overcome (take branding or market cap) unless Bitcoin has ETH level security snafu.

Most of the young professionals I know spend most of their disposable income on housing. The remainder is reoccurring expenses such as cell, cable, utilities.

There are no guarantees in life, but with the amount of money spent to date by startups and established national companies in the Blockchain, it does put a floor on the major cryptocurrencies. Adoption is still sub 1% in developed nations. I'd say barring debilitating government regulation or ban, probabilistically we still have more room for upside. Risk adjusted, Bitcoin is still cheap if adoption continues.

I mine and hodl. Although the price has gone up about 8 fold, the difficulty has risen about 5 fold. The net gain is actually even less since there is greater cost operating a 16nm miner to make the same BTC (over the comparable period you require 6-7x the footprint to make the same BTC daily). 
Example. A year ago with 11ths miner you made over 0.01 BTC daily. Now a 14ths miner makes 0.0018 BTC a day. You encounter 6-7x more operating costs in power, cooling, administration, power supplies, etc.
The net gain as a miner on a fiat basis is slightly positive year over year (not 600%). If the next gen 7nm ASIC comes out and a miner hasn't fully amortized their gear, there is a loss rather than achieving ROI.
That being said, I believe the pools are the ones that are highly polarized. Especially with approximately ~50% of Hashing power directly contributed or proxied through Bitmain owned/controlled pools.

Rather than adopt Bitcoin, a nation such as Venezuela should stealthily acquire another established blockchain which can always be atomically swapped later for Bitcoins. This way they don't compete for blockspace at the moment on Bitcoin, but have a secure transaction medium. Later when LN is fully up and running, they can atomic swap at their leisure.
Any of the minor SegWit enabled alts would do. Those that already have Bitcoin can choose to swap some or all into the altcoin. The government can trade-in the failing currency from citizens for the altcoin. Starting with bank balances and government salaries. Give public benefits in the altcoin and accept it for taxes.

Yes. More that I think about it, one had to have an insane CPU based mining operation in 2009/2010 to have amassed $10k worth in 2010. Back then prices were defined by raw energy costs. To have had that many CPUs burn through $10k in electricity in less than 12 months time was a setup of several hundreds of thousands. Easy for many from a business point of view to plunk down six-seven figures from 2012 and beyond. But, you would have had to steal resources or been a true believer to setup a full scale mining operation in 2009.

Fortunately Bitcoin trades in a free market. Everybody is responsible for disseminating information and assess their value at risk and their tolerance for volatility. Strong hands will always be there to catch the cast offs from weak hands. I welcome opportunities for further accumulation. I know many people who are still in evaluation phase and feel like they missed the boat. Many will be glad to get involved on pull backs. This is the 1994 of the internet adoption. I remember using hyper terminal before Mosaic came out. Bitcoin is still clunky like the web in 1994. We'll have our 2000 moment as well and then the 2.0 phase that made giants of Amazon and Google 10-15 years after.

It would take a paradigm shift of a house buyer accepting Bitcoin, a lender originating a Bitcoin based loan with traditional payback periods, securitizing tranches of Bitcoin debt and syndicating debt to investors to break the banking system.
Just not sure if that would work because Bitcoin is a mix of inflationary and deflationary at the same time. Inflationary strictly from mining rewards and deflationary on two fronts, adoption from the masses and lost coins/dust.
It would be near impossible to payback Bitcoin over 30 years if borrowed today, especially considering a house is probably the biggest asset that an individual may own.

This is very similar with ShapeShift. You can squeeze another 1-4% by using Poloniex, but it can get clunky dealing with posting/taking, especially in fast markets or if you need to make two trades if you are not starting with BTC, or trading into a crossing pair with ETH, XMR or USDT. Sometimes you can get legged and pay more if market moves away before you can complete second side of transaction.
So this is why ShapeShift is growing so fast. Think they are at the point that they can cross internal with their order flow or fill with their own inventory and take to competing exchange otherwise.
