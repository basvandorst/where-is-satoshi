I don't remember exactly what was said. But there were a lot of witnesses so maybe someone captured it. 
Anyhow, there are several references to it. 
First mention around the five minute mark. And again at the 7:30 mark. Maybe more, these were the first I found: 
5:00: "Sorry to quickly interrupt, my apologies, I've just chucked up a link to the reddit, a post that I made just saying that i've, was successfully able to withdraw, all of my bfx-coins, ahh, sorry, bit, coins from Bitfinex, if you would go and give it a quick upvote just so, everyone knows that it's... legit." 
7:30: "Yeah that PSA I wrote about coins being withdrawn successfully, it's allready on the front page, guys, cause we got three upvotes real quick, so it's on the front page, everyone go chuck an upvote at it, just so everyone knows and it stays on the front page."
Phil asked people to go brigading some minutes earlier.
Edit: Actually, the first reference is around the 25 second mark.

It seems like the security of the Bitfinex platform has degraded very badly since BitGo integration in 2015.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:21:29
This move away from hot/cold wallets turned out to be NOT optional, it was enabled silently, not communicated to users, it allowed bypassing of user 2FA, it opened for a total loss of funds, instead of the 0.5% in hot wallets, remainder in cold storage which contained the loss experienced in 2015.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:01:56
This seems like outcome which could possibly be legally defensible.

Soon, probably: 
Oh no, this is terrible, we seem to have been hacked, again, because although we have no idea how we lost 120000 BTC, we made sure our first priority was to open for business as fast as possible so as not to lose market share.

Yes, the currency is unspecified, probably lira. A rather petty amount.
So Mr. Devasini started his career as petty criminal. 
And somehow he ended up being the Chief Financial Officer of the largest non-chinese Bitcoin exchange. 
Presiding over a heist of 120000 Bitcoins lost to unknown perpetrators.
Not such a petty amount. One of the largest heists in world history.

No free lunch here either. Reducing block times, gives a corresponding increase in block orphan rate, which is creates pressure towards mining centralization. [O(1) block propagation]( would mitigate this, but O(1) block propagation is some ways away. 
If any particular copycoin was to achieve usage comparable to Bitcoin, made-for-marketing advantages like "faster block times" would be revealed illusory, and that copycoin would then have to seriously consider these same trade-offs, which Bitcoin had to seriously consider. Meanwhile, so long your copycoin sees no serious use, it remains free to optimize for marketing at the expense of all else.
This "Disregard everyhing, optimize for marketing!" approach hasn't produced any real advantages so far.
And is unlikely to do so in the future, for obvious reasons.

Wow. No progress? This is not morse, it's probably binary.
Prior hypothesis: This will turn out to be a bitcoin private key...
(Could always be BIP38 encrypted with clues to the password hidden in the signal.)
Sampled the audio and had a quick look in Audacity. Making the original available for download would be useful.
Anyhow, each bit lasts for about 50 milliseconds, so 20 bits per second of audio.  
The "message" part lasts roughly 25 seconds, so the message size is roughly 250 bits. 
Which fits nicely with our hypothesis. [BFSK]( encoded? PCM?
Very easy to encode, not so easy to automate demodulation without appropriate software or hardware.
But since the message is so short, one could always count the ones and zeroes manually. :)
Oh, and, the choice of encoding algorithm doesn't really matter with manual decoding.
Anyhow, something like [this]( would make demodulating the signal back to binary easy peasy.  
Unfortunately it doesn't come free.
 
Guessing there is plenty of FOSS [packet radio]( software that can handle this sort of problem. 
Hmm, perhaps this could work:  (Haven't tried it.)
Maybe just count the bits? :)
If it turns out to be a whole Bitcoin it could be worth it...
I *think* the the first four bytes are:  
    11010101  
    10010000  
    01001010  
    11101110  
Or the [inverse](
    00101010 01101111 10110101 00010001

Effectively, any wallet or service that announces support of a feature which expands the capabilities of Bitcoin will be [damnatio memoriae'd]( from 
And if any Bitcoin service, like Mycelium, or Coinbase, or whatever, should publicly admit to liking any hardfork proposal, at any time, for any reason, now, or in the future, they will never, must never, be allowed to voice their support?
And meanwhile people are intending to solicit the opinion of wallets, exchanges, services, for their position on this very issue? 
So this proposal is promoting a policy of censorship.  
But, it's *not* merely censoring Bitcoin-XT. It's threatening all bitcoin wallets, exchanges, service providers from voicing support for any hardfork, for any reason.
This means the capabilities of Bitcoin must always shrink (as in a softfork), never expand (as in a hardfork).
Isn't this, too, a little dangerous?

Send any amount of money, to anyone, anywhere, at any time, for a fixed fee.
So you can send money to a friend, in Antarctica, in the middle of the night, at the cost of 0.3 cents. 
It's nice that it costs less than half a cent to send a dollar - but it also costs half a cent to send *a million* dollars. 
So at this level, it's simply a form of money appropriate for the internet age. 
Or "magical internet money", as some like to call it.
Now, this is *neat* for you as a consumer, but it's *really useful* for businesses and organizations that have to conduct transactions across borders and currencies.

With some regularity now, Andreas swings by and drops insight with such impact that my mind needs hours or days to re-adjust. Well, this was one of those times. 
I greatly enjoyed this show, but feel it would be more accessible if Fred Wilson was covered in a separate episode. 
Though there is some irony in that the second half of the show effectively argues for the irrelevance of the first.
The *first* half could be TL;DR'd into a bland list of bullet points. ("Bitcoin: Megatrend!" "Sociology, not technology." etc.)
The *second* half, is far stronger. Mindblowing in a way no list of bullet points can capture. I'll just say you owe it to yourself to listen to the damn thing. At length. Without distractions. (If I'm wrong, then come back and yell at me.)

*None* of the self styled "Bitcoin 2.0" projects have attracted *any* venture funding.
Mike didn't indicate any problem with legit companies with proven business models getting funded.  (Coinbase, Bitpay, and so on.)
It seems to me that this entire point is likely a misunderstanding on part of the journalist.
Perhaps it would be more faithful to Mike's intent to say "Bitcoin 2.0 could be a bunch of hot air."

2. EXANTE went on to become the best performing hedge fund in the world.  
(Making a return of 4400% for 2013, IIRC)
3. [July 2013]( Jon Matonis is appointed Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation.
4. EXANTE sold some of the Bitcoins they acquired, as the MtGox situation deteriorated. ^*
5. Because of (1) and (4): Matonis is "enormously corrupt" (read: LITERALY HITLER) ^**
6. Because of (5) and (3): The Bitcoin Foundation is corrupt. (read: eats babies.)
7. "Tom Butterfield", author of this latest conspiracy fails to produce promised damning evidence.
8. Because of (7): Matonis (or Gavin!) must have bribed him (OR WORSE!!!).
9. Because of (8): Butterfield is currently missing and presumably dead by verdict of net upvotes on \* Which is to say, they locked in profits, *hedging* their position.

Your question is: Why are they getting so much funding? 
The short answer: [Allaire](
The slightly longer answer: ["What is Bitcoin? And Why Should I Care?" - Jeremy Allaire @ MIT Bitcoin Club](
It is the [opening speech]( of the [MIT Bitcoin Club]( it's excellent, and it has entirely too few views.
Allaire has a bad rep around these here parts. I think this is because he is first and foremost, a businessman.  
As opposed to, say, a libertarian radio host or something. 
Jeremy Allaire is a wizard. 
Allaire built Allaire corporation, with his brother. 
Allaire corporation was acquired by Macromedia (Coldfusion, Shockwave, Dreamweaver, Flash, etc.) 
where he lead the development of the technologies that powered and built the early web.
As CTO at Macromedia, Allaire led the development of, among other things, the [flash platform]( 
Do you have a flash plugin in your browser? 
(It's arguably the world's most widely distributed, certainly among the most downloaded pieces of software.)
He has the business and management skills to build the company that makes cryptocurrency something your mom could use, would use, and would want to use.  
Like he helped do with the web in the late nineties. (Back then, the web was for nerds.)
So there's his proven track record.
And add to that, a thorough understanding of Bitcoin on a technical level (see: that MIT video).
And a vision for Bitcoin *beyond* mere currency (again, see the video.)
He's the sort of guy you want to throw money after, just to see where it takes you.

For posterity: I think MtGox will reinstate BTC withdrawals (but not fiat withdrawals) within a reasonable timeframe, up to two weeks likely, one month max.
I think it's near impossible for Mt.Gox to have somehow "lost" more than at worst 10% of their BTC holdings, because cold storage. Without fractional reserve, a "bank run" should cause them to shrink, not topple. Outright fraud in mens rea by Karpeles would be stupid beyond reason.

They were seized due to "suspicion" of money laundering.
At Mt Gox, your Bitcoins were pooled and your coins were mixed with those of Ross Ulbricht and Trendon Shavers and Charlie Shrem, all of whom are under criminal investigation. In a normal bank, those particular accounts would simply be frozen, but at MtGox there was no clean way to separate "dirty" and "clean" coins. Evidence such as USB-sticks, paper wallets, disk drives were seized, forcing MtGox out of business, without being able to properly explain why. The funds remain inaccessible, but not permanently lost. Since these and other criminal investigations are ongoing, the involved law enforcement agencies remain mute on the subject. 
If Mark Karpeles was suspected of cooking the books, or theft or embezzlement of HALF A BILLION DOLLARS,  
he would be in police custody from day one, and held in remand today, awaiting his trial.
And that explains how Gox 'lost' 650,000 BTC.

Well, Bitcoin is not anonymous. This is an oft repeated misconception.
Perhaps if someone were to seize this opportunity to point out to Mr. Gates the specific ways in which Bitcoin differs from an anonymous system (such as cash), his opinion could change?
I'm frankly unsure wether this is his true opinion or something he says for PR reasons due to reputational risk.
The unsurpassed transparency of Bitcoin could be a massive boon to developing economies,  
since they tend to suffer most from corruption and money disappearing in the cracks of the system.
I don't think one could pull off [Mobutu or Suharto level cleptocracy]( with Bitcoin,  
since one could then follow the money quite unlike perfectly anonymous dollar notes.
Malaria may be the greatest natural impediment to developing nations,  
but corruption is an enormous, and entirely man made impediment.

Yeeeah. :D
Having been here for a couple of years now, I had to take a couple of minutes to think about this report yesterday. 
Just thinking about the fact that it exists in the first place.
Savouring it. Reading that paper felt like a victory of sorts. The contents of the paper are interesting, but not terribly important. What is important, I feel, is this: 
Goldman friggin Sachs wrote a friggin Global Macro report on friggin Bitcoin. 
Goldman could pretty much damn Bitcoin it to hell for all I care (they didn't, by the way),  
the journey isn't over, but in some small way, we have arrived.
By this I mean: Bitcoin has arrived on the global stage. Bitcoin is not going fade away. 
It's far from guaranteed that Bitcoin will survive the next decade. 
But by now, I feel it's pretty much guaranteed that Bitcoin will change the world.  
Make a dent in the Universe, if you will.
Bitcoin may break or crash or disappear, but whatever happens next, Bitcoin will change the world, and improve the lives of millions and countless millions of people around the world in the process.

Apologies for my cynicism, but...
You sent your irreversible digital currency to an anonymous illegal website and they went ahead and lost it for you. 
Your question is: 


Their [terms of service]( state: 


Fund does not accept any liability for any data transmission errors such as data loss or damage or 
alteration of any kind, including, but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential damage, arising out of the use of the products or services referred to herein.*
So, they waive all responsibility for any fuck up on your part or their part or on part of "the internet."
If anything bad happens, you're SOL. 
So let's pretend this was 4000 BTC, not 4 BTC. Then sue them. Oh, right, you can't.
You could try to make enough noise for it to be cheaper for them to reimburse you than to ignore you.  
(Actively hurt their business through damaging their reputation.) 
I doubt enough people will listen. 4 BTC is a fair price for the lesson.
You could complain to Mt.Gox bankruptcy trust, but I don't know if they can return the money to an illegal anonymous third party website.
Most likely outcome: Mt.Gox bankruptcy trust just "recovered" 4 BTC.

    You'll find spelling errors.
    And scattered thoughts all over.

So, yeah, fair warning: This is going to sound like an post.
But I think it'll be worth it....
I'll edit and revise until the pieces start making sense or I give up,  
but I do hope the interested reader gets THE BIG IDEA.
Anyhow, let's go...
 EXIT STEALTH:
On the eve of 21s [grand announcement]( Whaleclub was discussing (mostly dissing) the 21 announcement. 
Whaleclub was (predictably) completely failing to see the significance, and making fun of said announcement. 
They were saying the same things reddit was saying:
*"These guys are completely stupid."*  
*"They have to understand it will never work"* etc. etc. etc. 
 
... sourced examples go here ...  
This banal criticism *completely disregards* the fact that  
the people investing in and building 21 **built good chunks of the modern internet**.
... list of people + achievements goes here ...
These are *very smart* and *very capable* boss level nerds. 
And they have weighed their time and priorities and found that Project 21 is  
the best use of (some or all of) their time, and a lot of their money.
The obvious inference is... there's OBVIOUSLY more to the matter than what's being said.
More on that later.
 365
Thrive365 asked for voice privileges on Teamspeak to correct some misconceptions.
I assume Thrive365 is *not necessarily* a 21 Inc. employee,  
but he claimed to be working on the project, in some capacity.
From what he said that night, I reckon he's not lying. Or perhaps it's all bullshit.
I don't know the guy. I can't verify. 
Maybe he's just three steps ahead of everyone else who has spoken on the subject.
Let's call him 365 for brevity.
365 said he was an embedded engineer working on [21's] embedded computing project.
365 sounded somewhat annoyed at whaleclub's mockery of his employer and his project.
Balaji's announcement was presumably made to stop 21 from being ridiculed in the media.
365's impromptu Q&amp;A was presumably to stop his employer from being ridiculed of on Whaleclub.
None of us like to be portrayed as morons in public. It stings.
So 365 spoke his mind.
I assume this rant on Whaleclub was unauthorized,   
as it revealed more than 21 revealed to the public,   
and although he didn't speak directly about it,  
what he said made more sense than what was made public that day.
 miners in toasters is **obviously** not the gameplan, or the endgame, it's a ridiculous distraction.
Or it's about managing expectations.
I recorded the TS session to be able to analyze and think about what was said.
Then I uploaded it to soundcloud to be able to discuss it with friends.
And pull out more information than what had been explicitly revealed.
e.g. 
Then I mostly forgot about the whole deal until this thread showed up...

You want to talk to Coinbase, The Bitcoin Investment Trust, Winklevoss Capital Management and Exante Bitcoin Fund.
They have faced this problem before, and solved it in broadly similar ways. Their security practices are, at least in part public knowledge, and, as large stakeholders in Bitcoin they stand to gain from having more actors enter this space.
For example: Geographically distributed "3-of-5" keys stored on different media (paper and digital) stored in secure vaults, in separate jurisdictions, with 5 separate people having access to one key each. 
With this, you should "be fine even if California disappeared into the ocean tomorrow" to paraphrase Fred Ehrsam of Coinbase during the NY DFS hearing.

The hypothesis that the forgery was committed by a former employee and unknown to OKCoin senior management was not a priori unreasonable.
But... OKCoin went on to offer a $20000 bounty for proving that a valid cryptographic signature is invalid (which *is* unreasonable) and can be taken to weigh against this explanation.
So, either way, OKCoin has fucked up and lost much credibility.
Publicly lying and getting caught, and then *not* apologizing for the mistake, but instead; inventing further lies and using misdirection to cover up their bad mistake is enough to make *anything* they say suspect, in my view.
The least they can do is come clean and apologize, and promise to stop lying at their every convenience.

Right, so, if you have a 500 GB HDD with a 1MB wallet file you would image every sector and then just discard sectors not containing particular interesting strings like "fromaddr | spent" or similar. If you locate the wallet containing sectors on the disk, you can ignore the other 99.9998% of burned metal and so your job gets half a million times easier.
A other recovery jobs could involve recovering many many gigabytes of surveillance video (especially after a fire!), or years worth of database transactions, or a life's work in photograpy, or scientific data, or what have you.

Some details here: 
I should add how Bitfinex failed to stop trading or display any kind of prominent warning on their website, so users kept on depositing money into the compromized hot wallet. 
For the next hour or so, while the hack was ongoing, Bitfinex and the hacker were racing to sweep incoming transactions from unsuspecting users. 
IIRC, this accounted for around 1000 of the around 1500 BTC that was lost in the attack.  
I haven't looked up the exact numbers.
Point being: 
 
A BIG RED banner with HOT WALLET COMPROMIZED (or something!) could presumably have limited the loss by ~2/3. 
I'd say this indicates that there was no advance planning for the contingency where the hot-wallet gets compromized.  
Which indicates that they lack planning for any sort of contingency, since it should be pretty high on the list.

**[ran out of space... cont'd here]**
 365 was saying:
Virtualized [symmetric multiprocessing]( [ESX!](
Imagine a global virtualized hypercomputer with on-the-fly negotiable capacity,  
participating nodes being rewarded with Bitcoins for being part of that virtual computer.
i.e. Build a singular massively distributed global scale supercomputer to blow amazon Amazon's EC2 out of the water.
A global scale cloud computing cluster using *excess capacity* sourced from consumer grade, consumer owned hardware. Building the next generation computer. 
Bigger than any datacenter.
USING BITCOIN TO TURN THE INTERNET INTO ONE BIG COMPUTING MACHINE.
HOLY ****** SHIT!
 ARE ONLY USING 10%... would you like some Bitcoin?"
So I'm thinking...
There are *billions* of computers in the world today. We are *putting millions* more online *every single day*.
How much of the global pool of *internet-connected computing resources*  
[compute, storage, bandwidth, memory]
is **idle** (i.e. just going to waste, generating heat) at any particular time? 
Well, most of it.
21's "Grand plan" could involve putting these idle, wasteful computing resources to some productive use.
If this is technically feasible, it's the biggest business plan since... I don't even know.
Balaji has said, "Bitcoin is bigger than google." i.e. if google pointed 100% of their computing resources at Bitcoin mining, they'd have 1% of the network. And nobody could understand what he was on about. 
Google datacenters are general purpouse computing hardware, SHA-256 miners only do one thing.
It's often said: You're only using 10% of your brain. That is false. But most of your neurons are running idle.
Running [NOPs]( Waiting for work to come by.
If 21 could unlock the metaphorical (or actual) 90% of computing resources that are being wasted,  
and put a good fraction to some productive use. That would obviously be a huge, huge, huge deal.
Bitcoin provides the economic incentive to unlock these resources.
You could be rewarded with satoshis or millibits by the second or by the minute.
For letting 21 borrow your hardware and renting it out.
What if, instead of simply building more computers,  
we use bitcoins as the economic lubricant to utilize  
the unused capacity of hundreds of millions of computers  
running on idle in homes, schools, offices and datacenters.
So you can agree to throw those spare compute resources at protein folding or business problems,  
Turning your machine (PC, server, laptop, router, fridge) into a part-time node in a global virtual supercomputer.
You pimp out your hardware to google so that they don't have to build that new expensive datacenter, but use your home computer instead. 
No worrying about cooling costs!
The world is filled with increasingly powerful computing devices.
Most of them doing nothing, most of the time.
See for yourself:
If you happen to be on a Windows machine:
* Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. 
* Go to task manager.
* Show processes from all users.
* Sort by CPU time.
At the top... you'll find "System idle process.", likely at 80-90%
On Linux/Mac you can use  for example.
Hey! Is that 90% of your CPU time going to waste? (Oh no! Think of the environment!)
How much of your available bandwidth are you using right now? 
Less than 10%? Less than 1%?
Your processors are running idle for the majority of the time.
Most of your available bandwidth is unused, right this very moment.
 case of Google and shrinking hardware cost
One of the more important clever things Google did when starting out was....
using consumer hardware. not crazy expensive server hardware.
Normal consumer HDDS, farms of *normal PCs* to crawl the web.
Brilliant, in retrospect. 
This brought costs way down. This made Google feasible.
Perhaps Google could hire [a part of] 21's computer in the sky to run [MapReduce]( or other algorithms, maybe not.
You'd presumably be limited to [Embarrassingly parallel]( problems.
But many [important problems]( are embarrassingly parallel.
see: 
or any distributed computing project you care to think about.
21 could bring not thousands, but millions and eventually billions of computers, to bear on problems, by working in their spare time. [Using idle CPU cycles.]( Because you can reimburse the worker nodes in BTC.
You'll get paid for it! Current distributed computing projects cannot reward contributors with money.
This one can.
Using BTC transactions to negotiate use of spare computing resources (Storage, CPU, Bandwidth) for unknown applications. We can build a global supercloud.
The general public still has no idea what their business plan is.
But this could be one piece of it.
 note on Bayesian inference:
From the set of all possible hypotheses, describing all possible worlds that fit the available evidence, 
which hypotheses are more likely to be true, given what we know?
When judging the probability of hypotheses being true based on partial evidence.
Building an "internet-sized computer" isn't the *only* hypothesis that fits the evidence...
...but it knocks making toasters out of the park.
 21 is SKYNET?
Very obviously, 21 Inc. is not *simply* about putting chips in people's hardware to make money off of mining.
Perhaps then, 21 is hoarding Bitcoins to PAY PEOPLE for RENTING OUT their GENERAL (not application specific) computing hardware **for** BTC.
Perhaps they are putting BTC *hardware wallets* and SHA-256 miners in routers and SoC silicon. 
For some unrevealed future use.
 and micropayments
This one is obvious. No Skynet on the mainchain. Not with 1MB blocks.
--&gt; Enter [Lightning networks](
 
But 21 Inc. has already mined &gt; 65K BTC, according to year-old data.
For themselves? Or... to pay the worker nodes of Skynet. 
 everything:
Every work unit delivered by 21/skynet would need strong unbackdoored, unbreakable encryption.
Which imbues the whole "Golden Key" encryption backdoor debate with new importance.
Privacy... Is a solvable problem. You can distribute your business secrets
IFF there is unbackdoored, trustworthy encryption.

 future citywide storage and excess electricity.
Excess power plays into it. 21's Skynet wants to profitably use that excess power.

Off course! It's not going to be *that* simple. 
 trade-offs:
21 wouldn't be paying for idle power consumption, only the *extra* power drain. The difference. And yeah, running full throttle is going to be unacceptable almost everywhere. But perhaps throttling up 10%, finding the sweet spot where you don't have to activate fans... is fine. Even at the office. Even in the living room. 
And off course, "Skynet worker drones" can tune the network's utilization of their equipment to their preference.
Think +10% utilization is plausible? How about +1%? 
That is, going from 10% CPU to 11% CPU utilization.
There will be subtle and important details, problems for which solutions have to be engineered.
Like with *any* startup.
But the particular problems don't add up to a deal-breaker.
Because the upside is unusually huge.
 mere doubling:
Now, what does that mean?
If current utilization of internet connected compute resources is around 10%, and you increase it by a mere 1%...
Hey! That sounds like failure. Boo! Failure bad! 
Err.... Nope! 
You've increased the *effective* compute power *of the entirety of civilization*, by **~10%**.
 
In a more optimistic, sky is the limit, long term scenario...
If Skynet increases *utilization* of compute resources from 10% to 20%,  
you've **doubled** the *effective* compute power of humanity. 
\*pause for mind-explosions\*
The dream for Skynet clients is [Higher OpEx, **zero** CapEx]( No for staff on site, 24/7. Your hardware will be free &amp; massively redundant hardware, and is getting replaced every 2-3 years, already. So, no hardware cost &amp; no maintainance. Etc. etc. etc.
The [total cost of ownership]( will be reduced to ***the difference*** in electricity consumption, paid in Bitcoin. 
Zero fucking CapEx! This gives you some wiggle room for those operational expenses, doesn't it?
Plus R&amp;D costs over at 21, which, will be large at first. (75%?) ;)
But in the long term these expenses will be vanishingly small, 
because they will be weighed against half the computational output of civilization.
Or whatever...
It's a crazy idea, but not a "forbidden by thermodynamics" crazy idea.
After you deal with *all* the unfortunate trade-offs you can still  
have the biggest most audacious tech-business ever.
And an internet-sized computer.

Proof-of-payment allows for de-monopolization of digital media and content on the internet.

Coinbase is excellent for dollar cost averaging into coin.
On every purchase they ask if you want to set up a recurring (daily/weekly/monthly) buy for a fixed dollar / currency amount.
Feel free to withdraw your balance to an offline signing machine / hardware wallet / cold storage at any time, when you figure out your preferred setup.

Or Bitfinex was doing testing on production again, as they do, Mark Karpeles style.
Like that time [*not two weeks ago*]( when they [accidentally disabled margin limits]( and an unknown number of people got into situations like having a 800BTC position on a 3BTC desposit, to name one example. 
More examples: [[1]](
(Thus [rediscovering]( an old Bitcoinica bug they grandfathered in from the code pirate ponzi victim "unclescrooge" stole and used to bootstrap Bitfinex, in desperation, after losing his BTC savings to BTCST.) To paraphrase the PR guy: "Current devs have no idea how it got there... It looked perfectly safe." 
And they went on to tell us that the people who got into 100-1000X leverage and lost and contacted them were set right. And their PR guy indicated they didn't have proper logs, and so had to be contacted by the individual customers who had gotten fucked over for tens of thousands of dollars to make them whole. Well, if anyone *won* on 1000X leverage and *didn't* contact Bitfinex to fix the issue, they could withdraw that money and presto... fractional reserve.
And, oh, lest I forget, their PR-rep leaked his own internal notes on reddit with (let's call it integration, not testing...) and didn't seem to realize this was bad.

I'm not saying they're not funny, or untalented.
But as history shows, when you run an exchange, the cost of bugs isn't limited to downtime.

But maybe your company is completely innocent in all this.
Perhaps you're the victim of some bizarre slandering campaign.
By people who have little to gain by slandering you,  
as they too find their names being dragged through the mud. 
And maybe we shouldn't worry, at all, over the fact that much of your executive team has quit,  
recently, citing ["differences of opinion", and "different directions."](
And maybe the world is terrible and treating you very unfairly.
But maybe... Maybe you should have paid the $10K/Month contract, which you knew you were bound to.
When a lawmaker steps down, the nation does not stop being bound by the laws he put in place.
When an employee departs a company, the company does not stop being bound by any contract he may have signed.
Even if it's a nasty contract. 
This is very basic stuff.
You were not smart enough to do the *right thing*.
And so we get to have this conversation.
**And so it's time to talk about trust:**
As a bitcoin exchange, people need to be able to trust you, with their very own hard earned money.
Perhaps even from half way around the world. 
If you fuck up, you will *hurt* people.
We need to be able to trust you to keep all the funds you're entrusted with, safe.
This means being secure against attack. 
Secure at every level (including against legal attacks) from any adversary, foreign or domestic, internal or external, from government, to foreign law enforcement agencies, to competitors, to simple opportunistic criminals.
You are [a money bin]( And you are a target.
Additionally, 
We need to be able to trust you to not trade against customers, not inflate numbers, not run a bucket shop, 
We need to be able to trust you to "keep a tight ship".
We need to be able to trust that you're not the next MtGox-in-waiting.
And at a much more basic level, we need to be able to trust you to adhere to contracts. 
Including formal, written contracts.
We need to be able to trust your competence.
And we need to be able to trust your very word.
And if you violate that trust, as you have, 
AND you achieve some level of business success.
Well, hooray, you've just become an eco-system liability!
You're **not allowed** to fuck up simple basic stuff like this.
Nobody wants to see OKCoin or-any-firm become the next MtGox.
So you best get your shit together - or go out of business while  
you're small enough to not catastrophically hurt everyone.
Think of running a business like running an engine. Trust is the oil that lubricates the various gears and parts and keep them all running smoothly. And you've broken that trust, and so you're experiencing an engine failure.
This means you need to go into **repair mode**. 
This means...
**1:** No more excuses. You need to apologize for past mistakes.   
**2:** And you need to promise to stop making mistakes in the future.   
**3:** And then go on to not make those mistakes which you promised to stop. 
And if you do that, then congratulations. And if you can't do that...
Then you need to go out of business.
Now I just so happened to write this in response to OKCoin, but it applies *just as much*  
to fucking Bitfinex and those fantastically incompetent twits at blockchain.info/wallet
 
Who have also lost a lot of trust recently, due to mindbogglingly spectacular fuck-ups of their own.
It applies to every exchange and wallet in the business of *"playing bank"*. 
These are *base requirements* for running a Bitcoin exchange.
If you're a dumb-ass, go start the next Twitter or something.
Running a Bitcoin start-up is not for you.
There is little room for incompetence and **zero** room for dishonesty,  
when you're running a start up dealing with other people's money.

My best guess is that Draper invested and that OKCoin passed due dilligence at a level appropriate for a $1M angel investment at that time. 
And furthermore that OKCoin is completely ineligible for further investments after the OKCoin vs Roger Ver fiasco.

When I heard about Bitseed, I *immediately* wanted one. (But then, about 10 seconds later, when I landed on your website, I discovered Bitseed II, which I wanted even more.) [So, why not wait? It's only a couple of weeks, right?](

And so long as they remained it was very hard for competitors to get a foothold.
After failing and failing and failing again they still had near &gt;90% market share.

our method performs as good or better (on average) than
any of the existing image formats for lossless compression.
Interlacing is improved compared to PNG, making the format

Choose your platform, then choose your wallet.
You probably don't want to download and fully validate the entire blockchain before you even get started. 
So don't pick a fully validating client.
You won't be securing a million dollars on day one, so ignore any crazies recommending paper wallets with n-of-m keys scheme in multiple physical locations. You don't need better-than-bank-grade security, not on day one.
You need something that's going to secure about as much as a normal wallet. Any wallet listed on  should be plenty more secure than a regular old wallet back pocket wallet. If Bitcoin starts going up, and your wallet starts being worth more than a house, well then it's time to upgrade your security.

Release day is developer appreciation day.
Special note of thanks to who always gets blamed for everything anyone else has screwed up,  
which everyone else too have failed to fix yet. 
Over these last years, he has done as much to improve, fix and secure Bitcoin than just about anyone else. 
He couldn't be expected to achieve more without being a wizard of the magical variety.
And he has been Bitcoin's lightning rod. 
Perhaps a bespectacled ginger neckbeard genius triggers all the deep evil instincts in some people? 
Perhaps they feel safe thinking, this guy here, certainly no one will stand up for him?
Well so far the bullies have been overwhelmingly right in that assessment.
And it's a failure.
And it's a shame. 
And it's just not okay. Bullying in the workplace is not OK.
Standing indifferently on the sidelines saying: 
"Well he should stop defending himself if he wants the bullies to leave him alone." 
Is just cowardly.

No. Coinbase, Bitfinex, Poloniex and btc-e have all had problems, due to Ethereum's problems. Polo had their chain declared invalid last week or whenwasit, btc-e declared all customer assets on the original chain lost to replay, Bitfinex had Phil Potter explode in fit of rage over demands from on high—incoming edicts from Vitalik and the foundation on how to run their business.


Having to repeatedly scramble staff in the middle of the night due to whatever lastest emergency or else face loss of business and loss of reputation and loss of customer funds has to be taking a serious toll on their manpower. 
And a heavy toll indeed on their good will towards the project and it's messengers.
Again and again and again, we se that the promises used to sell Ethereum are broken on contact with reality. 
100% uptime? No. Decentralized? No. Unstoppable? No. No, no, no. 
It seems the more extravagant claims are being silently deleted from ethereum.org 
Were you not notified? Were you promised one thing and delivered another? 
There's a word for that. Fraud.
What use is a contract when Vitalik declares the contract invalid? What value in a business when Vitalik declares your business model invalid? What value in ETH when Vitalik declares your funds invalid? When he declares your blockchain invalid?
What incentive is there to support a fragmented Ethereum that is no longer growing and no longer  matters as a driver of business. 
Cheaper and easier for exchanges to drop it and be done with it.
Even Coinbase who gave Ethereum so much undue credit are deleting these earlier endorsements from the Internet.
It's not that Ethereum hasn't been shown to work yet.

**When will Coinbase allow disabling Ethereum?**
Doubling the number of elements for everything has totally cluttered up their user interface. 
Ethereum comes with unique and significant extra burdens for Bitcoin exchanges. In the last few months, they have had to start and stop deposits and transactions any number of times as new problems crop up, maintain mutually incompatible and defective clients, audit, upgrade and verify protocol versions, swallow losses to replay attacks.
You could add Dogecoin or any copycoin and still expect things to mostly just work after doing the initial setup. 
By contrast, Ethereum clearly doesn't "just work".
Just endless massive headaches.
Not to mention that Ethereum growth has completely stalled:

Bitfinex is worse than Mt.Gox in two important ways:
1) People knew exactly who was behind Mt.Gox. 
Even before everything started going to hell.
2) At least Mark Karpeles **wrote his own code**.

Bitfinex is *not* a financial services business run by competent, experienced professionals. 
Bitfinex is *not* built from the ground up on sound principles of financial software engineering. 
Bitfinex was copied from the leaked bitcoinica codebase, a Ruby-on-Rails app written by then 16 year old Ryan Zhou.
Saying "they reverse-engineered it" would be overly charitable. 
Bitfinex was released within some weeks of the Bitcoinica source code leak. 
The codebase was **copied** from a defunct, thrice robbed company.
That code is not capable of keeping the database consistent at peak loads.
That code is not scalable. That code was not, and is not correct.
Not correct according to specification. (Which doesn't exist.)
Not correct according to expectation. (The business logic of the exchange is *broken*.)
This becomes evident as the load on their server approaches capacity.
Everything goes to shit. Time and time again.
Their database stuff seems limited to concurrent reads, but single threaded writes.
It is a product of inspired design, not engineering.
It is very far from being remotely acceptable for a financial exchange.
But at least they have been making money since day one. 
(Because they had essentially no development costs, starting out.)
There is a good story here, waiting to be written by some investigative journalist.
Perhaps we will have to wait for some catastrophe before that happens.

I think the better tactical move would be to create a new paragraph discussing "Other Currencies", including Bitcoin, along with well sourced references. 
Bitcoin has - as a matter of fact - been the highest valued currency in the world for about 12 months or so.

No. It seems to me that current SETI projects are, for known technical reasons, unlikely to find what they're looking for, assuming it's there. The ETIs would need to literally flash us in the eye with an arecibo-sized dish from somewhere within a 300 parsec sphere centered on earth. Anything less powerful - or more distant - SETI would simply fail to find.  
Conditioned on this, I expect the marginal utility of a donation to the SETI institute to be zero. 
A couple of hundred million dollars would make a good starting budget for a proper search, instead of a largely symbolic one. I'd expect a SETI initiative that actually thought it could succeed to require government funding, or lacking that, a Crazy Gates Foundation. Not nerds with spare Bitcoins, anyhow.
I do welcome arguments and/or evidence to the contrary.

to disrupt the existing payments ecosystem is high, 
the role of sovereign currencies and established payment 
solutions is secure in the short to medium term. Any shift 
in consumer behaviour will be gradual due to the 
need for consumers to develop a level of trust in these 
alternative payment methods; trust in the payment 
solution, trust in the stewardship of the organisation 
that operates the solution, and trust in the regulatory 
environment that the solution operates under.
The vast majority of people are, and will continue to 
be, paid in a sovereign currency. Established payment 
networks (i.e. technologies and business relationships) 
also provide a significant barrier to newer players. As with 
most disruption, the shift will start in the niches before 
gradually working its way to the centre. While solutions 
are currently targeted at niches toward the bottom end 
of the market, they will quickly move up market as they 
mature. Consumer trust in these alternative payment 
mechanisms continues to grow despite a number of very 
public incidents that might test their confidence, such as 
the recent insolvency of the REDGroup and subsequent 
devaluation of all the outstanding gift cards issued by its 
collection of retailers.*


will drive us to take a more nuanced view of payments 
and how we exchange value. Organisations need 
to adopt a design- and customer-centred approach; 
one founded on how the consumer’s ‘job they want 
done’ is changing as their behaviour evolves, putting 
aside the old technology and infrastructure-centric 
approaches to payments that we have used in the past.


new contexts and currencies this implies), and the 
distinction between real and virtual spaces is eroded, 
it is important to ensure that a payments strategy aligns 
with how people interact and transact in these new 
environments, and how they bridge between the old 
and new worlds. A longitudinal approach is required, 
centred on the need to simplify the customer’s entire 
buying journey by ensuring that the right payment 
solution is available at the right place and time to service 
the customers’ transaction.


to transact when they want, how they want, with whom 
they want and in the currency that is most convenient. 
Payments need to take effect immediately, allowing 
consumers to exchange value with a merchant or a friend 
and then continue with their day. The solutions need to 
be ubiquitous, with payment providers able to support 
consumers transacting in the context the consumer finds 
most convenient, whether it might be at the cash register, 
in the aisle, standing with friends infront of a restaurant 
after a meal, on the internet, or in a virtual social 
environment. Providers must also support transactions in 
the consumer’s full portfolio of currencies, and not just 
sovereign currencies.*


of new regulatory regimes driven by governments’ 
need to provide a safe environment for consumers 
and merchants, and to assure tax revenue. As these 
new payment platforms become ubiquitous, the risk 
increases of a failure affecting a significant proportion 
of the consumer population, as does the possibility of 
transactions moving offshore.
How will governments’ react if one of these non-banking 
institutions fails? Some of these organisations might be 
the largest in their sector, such as Google with Google 
Wallet, but will they be considered financial institutions? 
Governments will be concerned with solvency and the 
security of firms that offer non-traditional payment 
services. Central Banks which are responsible for the 
smooth running of the payments infrastructure, such 
as the Reserve Bank of Australia, will move to integrate 
these new payments providers into existing payments 
frameworks. Accordingly, these firms may be required to 
apply for banking licences as they are, in effect, taking 
deposits. Other non-banking institutions might also be 
brought under the regulatory umbrella to ensure that 
the complementary currencies they offer, the gift cards 
and social media credits, remain solvent and to prevent 
them from becoming platforms for money laundering 
and fraud.


of the emerging (virtual) complementary currencies. 
Where previously a complementary currency could be 
outlawed (as many local currencies were in Germany 
during the Great Depression), or regulation passed to 
bring the complementary currency inline with sovereign 
currency (which happened to Bartercard), these new 
complementary currencies are managed by foreign, 
transnational organisations. In the case of Bitcoin there 
is no central authority. Transactions, and the tax revenue 
associated with them, can move offshore, even when the 
product or service is manufactured and provided locally. 
The transnational nature of these currencies will make 
regulation challenging, while also making the currencies 
virtually impossible to eliminate.*


the cash register and we now stand at the edge of a 
dramatic shift in where, when and how we exchange 
value. Organisations that cannot work with regulators to 
engender trust in their solution’s operation or follow the 
consumer-merchant relationship and provide payment 
solutions that are not instantaneous and ubiquitous, 
risk being left behind.*

It would be worth noting that some ponzies have carried on with *apparent* success for many years, yet all ponzies fail eventually. So, if BTCST is a ponzi as most people seem to believe, the question that  is *when*?
I think the demise of BTCST could do great harm to the Bitcoin economy.  They are so big relative to the Bitcoin economy, that their failure would cause massive fallout. Too many people are tied up with too much money. I believe *too big to fail* is an accurate way of describing their situation.

According to user [TwistedDrum5](  


SR works off of a escrow system. When someone hits purchase [or whatever it says] their money goes into an imaginary silk road bank. They can't access it anymore, and neither can the seller. Once They receive the goods They hit the Finalize button and the money goes from the bank into the sellers pocket.
Now if the buyer say they never got it, they do an investigation and usually the money will end up back with the buyer, screwing the seller. [Unless he has a tracking number] But I guess its a big hassle.
So for big money items in order to make sure the seller gets paid, they will ask for the person to hit finalize right away, that way the seller knows he will get his money. It's risky for the buyer, and most people will say not to do it, but since there is a rating system, if a seller decides to start scamming people, he will be quickly avoided because of his non perfect reviews.

Well, see, that depends on a number of things. Most of those things happen to be numbers. HYIPs die when they cost the operator more to run, than they cost to grow. When cost overtakes growth the operator leaves with his bounty.
So, to keep the scheme alive, you need growth. A lot of it. How much growth you need depends on how much you pay. Pirate pays out 7% of his victims holdings every week. A bunch of that gets reinvested, which helps the operator. Nevertheless, he needs to double the size of the fund roughly every 10 weeks to grow his bounty. As soon as the *average* growth of the ponzi is drops below 7% PER WEEK the rational thing for the operator to do is to pull the plug and run. 
Madoff needed around ~10% average yearly growth. Pirate needs ~3000%. BTCST may well have grown by 10000% this year, not that we have any way of knowing. This past growth is irrelevant. What is relevant to Pirate is how much it BTCST can be reasonably expected to grow in the future, not how much it has grown in the past. 4 years is *clearly* not viable with todays numbers. If BTCST grows "only" 5 percent weekly for four weeks, well, seven minus five is two percent times four weeks is eight percent of his total winnings gone. More than that if you take compounding into account. Not good if you're a pirate.
In fact, even if he dropped weekly payouts - and thus his need for growth - to a tenth of what it is today, he'd still need to absorb more than every Bitcoin in existence to keep afloat for four more years.To pull *that* off, Pirate would to go beyond the implausible and defeat mathematics itself. All things considered, I think it dies within the year.

It's not reasonable to mine Bitcoin using GPUs.
This is due to the exponentially increasing difficulty. 
See this graph: [Bitcoin network total computation speed.](
GPU mining became unprofitable several years ago. 
The level of competition has increased by several orders of magnitude since then.
These days all mining is done using [application-specific integrated circuits.](

There seems to be a "Murphy's Law" of Bitcoin Services at work. A quick attempt of a description:
If enough people send enough money to a Bitcoin service, then
at some point it will become more profitable for that service to "get hacked" 
or *suddenly disappear* with your money, than continue to provide that service.
When this happens, you can reliably expect the service to experience some difficulties,   
post an apology with vague promises of repayment, and then run away with your money.

Developers are faced with a balance of considerations with respect to wallet encryption.
Is the user more likely to lose funds from:  
(1) The theft an unencrypted wallet,  
(2) or losing the password to an encrypted wallet. 
Losses are bound to happen either way. Losses have in fact happened both ways.
If wallet encryption is *mandatory*, some users will enter the first thing they can think of, just get past the password prompt, and then at some point forget the password. Unfortunately, the customer service department cannot brute force your wallet. 
Therefore, optional encryption seems to be the best option. Which is what we have.
In any case, you have the ultimate responsibility for the safety of your keys. 
You only have to be stupid or reckless once to get hurt.
No one is babysitting your bitcoins.
Not being stupid is hard.

No, It's not true. 
Autumn Radtke was CEO of First Meta, an Singaporean digital currency company founded in 2007.  
First Meta focused on in-game virtual currencies like Linden dollars and IMVU.
In their own words: 


Now, First Meta may have *accepted Bitcoin* at one time, but she's no more Bitcoin CEO than any merchant anywhere that accepts Bitcoin.
However, someone, somewhere failed to make the distinction between *virtual currency in general* and *bitcoin in particular*, and so this legend came to be. First Meta was not as far as I can tell, a Bitcoin exchange - or - a Bitcoin focused company.
There is no connection between the death of Autumn Radtke - and Bitcoin - other than the slanderous lies of unscrupulous journalists in search of a sensational story. Which was repeated until, after enough rounds of chinese telephone the story became "Bitcoin CEO commited suicide."
The story is sad, but it's not true.

So, the idea is to embed that chip in smartphones, tablets, routers, everything. 
(Which is why Qualcomm &amp; Cisco are involved.) The "computer" is *not* a Bitcoin miner, it's a devkit.
It's a devkit for future devices which would have native Bitcoin support (wallets &amp; coin-generation) for identification (private keys), and micro-transactions. 
Today, content on the internet is powered by advertising. Because we lack microtransactions. Google &amp; Facebook &amp; Twitter are advertising companies. 21 aims to change that. The internet runs on advertising. 21 aims to change that.
Link unforgeable bitcoin private keys with biometric identification.
You just killed: Passwords... &amp; sign-ups... &amp; e-mail confirmation... &amp; login screens.
This removes a lot of the hassle and frustration from the online experience. 
So, give every internet user a source of fresh, unbought, newly generated Bitcoins, to enable e-commerce without logins and sign-ups. Well, guess what. No more need to keep customer data on file. 
Hey! You just killed identity theft in e-commerce.
You can shop online without revealing your name, address, phone number, birth date, mothers maiden name etc. etc. etc 
...to any *and every* new retailer. 
It would be like buying a newspaper, in cash, **no questions asked**.
Just give them the money and you're done! 
THIS IS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE ON THE INTERNET TODAY. (What is wrong with the world? We need to fix this!)
Why does every online retailer need all your personal data to sell you a digital good? 
Because credit cards &amp; identity theft. Also because advertising. 
In this new simpler internet, they don't need it, so so they shouldn't have it. Hooray!
The target cost for the 21 chip should be in the *pennies*, not dollars, not hundreds of dollars, certainly not $400.
This points the way to a simpler, friendlier, internet.
Better for content-producers. Better for internet users.
It points the way to an internet without any friction between: "i want this digital good" and "i'm enjoying this digital good." Games, books, streams, video, journalism. Any sort of digital content.
Oh, but this is possible today... Maybe, but only at a couple of select giant retailers like Amazon,  
where they made you go through that painful sign-up process and have all your data on file.
With this, all online commerce would become like one-click shopping at Amazon.
Which is bad for a handful of incumbents, and good for absolutely everyone else.
Visit your local newspaper. "Click to read this article." Done. 
Superconductivity for e-commerce. 
This is not a mining device, this is the **Altair 8800** of a new Bitcoin powered internet. 
Only, that Bitcoin powered internet doesn't exist yet. 
It's a possible future. And so we have to build it.
And if it works, it will remove **a lot** of dysfunctions and ineffieciencies and friction.
Lastly: Why can't you just preload the 21 device? Much cheaper, right? Because you don't kill identity-theft if you bought the micro-bitcoins from someone else, instead of generating them yourself.
In this post-password future, you will stop being your password and email address.
Instead, you will become your private keys.

Forth is a stack based general purpose programming language. Bitcoin script is similar to Forth. 
Craig: "No one seems to realise that Forth actually does loop." 
Well, sure it does. [There are forth machines and operating systems and so on.]( 
However, Satoshi made the active design choice to disable loops in bitcoin script as a security consideration. 
Bitcoin script is deterministic. Bitcoin script *is not* turing complete. 
It can be made turing complete in a hardfork, but *anything* can be achieved in a hard fork.

Well, from what I understand, sex is a very big industry around the world, not just in one county in Nevada. 
And, like the drug trade, it's can be pretty nasty because of (among other things) lack of legal recourse in cause of dispute etc. 
Typically cash in hand, very primitive. No way for a customer to know if the seller is healthy. No way for a seller to know if the customer is violent, or going to rob them. (With Bitcoin, one could pay to a cold wallet in a vault or safe somewhere off-site.)
After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, it would seem to me that "A Silk Road of Sex" could make this very-high risk market safer for those involved. Or perhaps that's being optimistic, I haven't really thought this through. :)
I'm surprised to hear that credit would be accepted, given the difficulties even mildly controversial businesses have getting access to banking services in the USA. "We don't especially like what you're doing, therefore, no bank account for you." As if the prostitution goes away if the banks won't serve sex workers.

Think "The Silk Road of Sex." Merchants and customers would benefit from trusted reviews. No less likely to make a fortune compared to Silk Road type shops, but less risk of severely bad legal outcomes for devs/admins.

I don't think you can break those algorithms without affecting *a lot* of other systems in the process.


What you describe wouldn't be the case of simply getting *a key*, but rather that of opening *all of the doors*. I think it would be safe to assume that Bitcoin would not be the only, or the most notable casualty. 
Now, assuming the attack didn't also break any laws of physics or anything, internet banking systems, payment cards would be broken, the NSA et al. would be out of a job as very many forms of digital signatures, authentication would be worse than useless, many secret communications would be effectively plaintext, all passwords for innumerable internet services would be compromised, allowing the attacker to read and do almost anything. World markets would come to a halt, there would be chaos, scandals, lawsuits, divorces, possibly wars, as dirty secrets in finance and otherwise are laid bare for all to see, all at once. 
**tl;dr** Bitcoin would die in a fire, no one would notice, what with The World Coming To An End and all.

Cool. Really cool. I'm interested in buying a share.  
Perhaps *First Blockchain* could be a (voluntary, of course) Bitcoin Business Register?  
My mind is awash with ideas right now. This is profound. (But perhaps not obviously profound.)
Tamper-proof timestamping can eliminate a lot of public bureaucracy.
In the future, the blockchain technology, will lower your taxes.  
(With help from digital signatures and timestamping.)
We can eliminate the need for expensive trusted parties (a function typically served by some state-owned institution) to verify that a particular version of some legal document (for example a sales agreement) was signed by a particular person at a particular time.
This may sound like a small thing. And on a case by case basis, perhaps it is.
But perhaps not. Where I live, this "need for trust which can be eliminated by bitcoin" adds several percent to the cost of buying a car, and perhaps 1% to the cost of buying a house, to name the two most obvious examples.
In sum... 0.1 to a few percent of World GDP sounds entirely plausible to me.

365 days per year and 14.207 days doubling time gives roughly 25 doublings per year.  
2^(25) = 33554432. The current hash rate looks to be around 700 TH/s.  
In *one* year, the hash rate would be 700 TH/s times a factor of 33554432 = 23488102400 TH/s,

I'm guessing Mt.Gox's failure to cooperate in a "timely and seamless" manner could result from the sustained and severe DDOS attacks they've been suffering this past month. (Not to mention the unprecedented influx on customers which necessitated immediate up-scaling of their technology, support, media-relations, account-processing efforts.)
Expecting Mt.Gox to be able to proceed in a "timely and seamless" manner given the strain on (otherwise availabe) man-power, and then using "failure to cooperate" as the basis of a 75M lawsuit is... a bit of a dick-move.

Obviously, Bitcoin has worked and will continue to wark flawlessly regardless of volatility. 
Which is not to say that continuing volatility won't impact Bitcoin *chances to succeed* in the long run.
First, I see that people have already posted Tim B. Lee's post of yesterday:
You raise important, interesting, and as far as i can tell, *unresolved* questions.
Satoshi's (brilliant, foolish?) distribution function enabled bootstrapping Bitcoin from one user, zero value, and no utility, into the billion dollar machine we use and love today. Quite impressively, it worked! While this clever, but ultimately arbitrary design choice enabled the adoption and the value Bitcoin, it is, to put it mildly, not one that incentivises stability. 
(Who here hasn't thought "21 million Bitcoins ever… I want one of those!".) 
And so... here we are.
The particular, clever, arbitrary, so-far-successful distribution function drives adoption,  
drives volatility, and is perhaps *not the one you'd pick* for a mature *currency*. 
But Bitcoin is *more* than a currency, a technology of many uses, and, it may turn out, perhaps not even a currency at all, despite the name. While today it is most commonly referred to as a "currency", this will perhaps not turn out to be the central, or the most important use.. 
Bitcoin is a technology, which implements a protocol, which is supported by software, which runs a network, which solves several important problems, with which most of you should be familiar by now.
As a partial solution to the volatility problem, Bitpay's model allows *merchants* to accept and use Bitcoin without worrying about volatility at all. (This leaves the worrying to be done, but that worrying is left to the the customer of the merchant.)
Bitcoin is awesome and brilliant in many ways, but, as far as I can tell, there *is no mechanism* which enforces, or even promotes price stability, at the current adoption level, or *at any* adoption level. There is always the risk of the value of your Bitcoins plummeting, or skyrocketing, which can be equally bad. All this leads me to think that a bitcoin-derived, or bitcoin-inspired protocol could wind up being the global *currency* of choice a hundred years from now. While Bitcoin, perhaps, like the unix to your linux, fullfills some niche even after its (yet unborn) progeny assumes the role of being the global currency of choice.
Here's an interesting comment that may be of some relevance:

Looks like this is for people who want to invest some hundreds of thousands, to millions of dollars into Bitcoin. Which tends to be a bit more involved than buying a handful of coins due to liquidity, slippage, regulatory and security concerns.
Sounds like this could (for example) allow Joe Millionaire (who reads about Bitcoin in The Economist, or the Financial Times, or the New York Times, or the Wall Street Journal) to tell an investment manager to *"get me some of those bitcoin things"*, have the investment manager set things up with The Bitcoin Fund, and make it happen.

Empirically, vacuum energy is a real effect. 
However, it's (let me google that, real quick) on the order of 1 billionth of a joule / m^3. 
Measurable, albeit very, very very small.
Now, some calculations indicate that the natural size of this effect (according to some very useful theories) should be 10^119 times greater. I don't remember the exact details. Nevertheless, those calculations were, very obviously, **wrong**.
Richard Feynman explains: ["If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong."]( (He just so happened to co-invent, and subsequently win a Nobel Prize in physics for this particular theory.) Why is lambda so small? We don't know, but it seems to be outside the range of questions which Quantum Electrodynamics can answer.
Of course, If the cosmological constant was much larger (nevermind 120 orders of magnitude) low-energy physics, with things like atoms, chemistry, life, stars, galaxies and all the other neat things would not and could not exist. 
Infinite energy would be... literally [worse than Hitler](

Oh come on... 
Money and coinage is one thing but the notion of "private property" surely predates even history itself?  
You can bet pre-historic humans had a good sense of what was "my spear", and also "our meat."
You might say some society, perhaps some tribe of indigenous americans had some particular collectivistic trait or another, such as the lack of land-ownership. (Which would make perfect sense in a non-agrarian society.) They would still own their tents and whatever valuables were relevant to their survival and well-being. They would still engage in trade of a rich set of commodities, perhaps even by means of some "standard" currency, such as gold, or corn in the Americas. (Or measures of grain in Europe.)
And if you were to take someone's private property, say the headgear of some tribal chief, there would surely be consequences. Because you just don't fuck with that which belongs to the chief.
Come to think of it, "private property" seems to predate our own species, I mean, consider the varied kinds of animals on the Serengeti. They seem to have a pretty good understanding of private and public goods. (Here too with serious and deadly consequences for those who would mistake the two.)
Is a leopard then a capitalist? 
Does that make a pride of lions freely sharing a meal "collectivist"?
If so, you try stealing dinner from a lioness.
It's not like some guy with pomaded hair sat down behind a desk, said "Eureka!", before writing with a feather pen: "This thing here... is MINE!" and then that was the start of private property.

I think it's a fun experiment, but it feels kinda forced and premature.


I don't think Bitcoin fits neatly into the "currency" or the "commodity", or indeed *any* category. 
It certainly doesn't look like a currency, walk like a currency or quack like a currency.  
This leads me to think that Bitcoin isn't a currency. (At least not yet.) 
The primary use seems to be as a store of value. (Quite like gold and other precious metals.) 


Maybe. It needs to become at least a thousand times more stable first.
It's not fun to have your Bitcoin denominated salary give you (for example) one third of the purchasing power of last month. Or to buy something for 1 BTC today, only to realize you could have bought it for 0.5 BTC the week after.
I think Bitcoin shows *greatest promise* as a 24/7 trust-free, bankless, low-cost decentralized "clearing house" and transnational medium of exchange. 
I don't know what Bitcoin is, exactly, but it doesn't seem to fit neatly into any existing category. It's something entirely new, a puzzle of many pieces, having *many* exciting features, some of which lend themselves to powerful, and unexplored uses.
Bitcoin is a sign-post pointing the way to "the future of money",  
but unfortunately, we don't know [what the future holds yet](

An infinite energy potential would be confined by nothing, would expand from the origin at very near the spead of light, destroying any structure it encounters, at any level, —  from nuclei, to atoms, to molecules, to planets, to galaxies, and so on — in the entire future light-cone of that unfortunate patch of the universe. 
This would be "Big Bang" 2.0

It could seem like Bitcoin has been presented to Munger as an immediate and direct candidate for replacing every fiat currency on the intertubes and in the world at large, given his earlier comment from Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting:
  
*"I have no confidence whatsoever in Bitcoin being a universal currency."*
Well, even code-sweating cypherpunks will admit that the converse of that statement remains far-fetched.
I find Buffett's *"undecided"* comment extremely fascinating.
Like he's saying: *"Now now, my senile friend, let's not get carried away."*
I find it strange and impressive that Buffett does not dismiss "this Bitcoin thing" out of hand.
Perhaps he has learned to not dismiss new ideas, however strange, when Bill Gates vouches for them. 
And, incredibly, that is just what Bill Gates goes and does next...
Bill Gates just went on TV and endorsed the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin,  
in the strongest possible terms, short of buying up the lot of them.

* 1. This case involves fraudulent offers and sales of securities by Shavers and BTCST, a Bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme founded and operated by Shavers. 
* 2. Bitcoin (“BTC”) is a virtual currency that may be traded on online exchanges for conventional currencies, including the U.S. dollar, or used to purchase goods and services online. BTC has no single administrator, or central authority or repository. 
* 3. From at least September 2011 to September 2012 (“relevant period”), Shavers, operating under the Internet name “pirateat40,” offered and sold BTCST investments over the Internet, raising more than 700,000 BTC in principal investments from BTCST investors, or more than $4.5 million based on the daily average price of BTC when the BTCST investors purchased their BTCST investments.
* 4. Shavers falsely promised investors up to 7% interest weekly based on BTCST’s purported BTC market arbitrage activity, including selling BTC to individuals who wished to buy BTC “off the radar,” quickly, or in large quantities. 
* 5. In reality, the BTCST offering was a sham and a Ponzi scheme whereby Shavers used new BTCST investors’ BTC to pay the promised returns on outstanding BTCST investments and misappropriated BTCST investors’ BTC for his personal use.

Nah, space may well be infinite. This is perhaps strange, surprising, contrary to common sense, but not *impossible*. Whether it is *true* depends on unknown dynamics of the inflationary epoch of the very early universe.
At any rate, "the whole thing" is *known* to be much, and very much larger than our particular *Hubble Volume* i.e. *observable* universe. 
The two alternatives not yet ruled out by cosmological data are:
1: The universe is spatially infinite, or  
2: just really, really fucking big, bigger than we're able to tell.
Still, there is an infinite difference between infinitely big, and just big enough to make Douglas Adams cry in despair. (As a brief aside, the total *energy* of the Universe could very well be exactly zero, which would make the whole thing, creation-ex-nihilo 'n all, permissible from known physics.
The data from [WMAP]( [PLANCK]( exactly agree with a flat, spatially infinite universe, the data also support a very big (unknowably big) universe. (At least e^60 or so times larger than the observable universe.) There is no way of telling the alternatives apart, based on the data. But the data exactly agree with a spatially infinite universe.
---- 
Note that there's a number of other ways for universes, such as ours, to be infinite, which are unrelated to the geometry of space, such as, notably:
[Hugh Everett]( no-collapse QM aka. the "[Relative State Formulation]( aka. "Many Worlds". 
[Leonard Susskind]( "Landscape" of [string theory vacuua]( which, incidentally happen to explain why the vacuum energy of the cosmos is sufficiently low to *not* immediately blow up everything.
And more speculatively, [Max Tegmark]( "Ultimate Ensemble", aka "[The Mathematical Universe Hypothesis](

Yep. FWIW (again) I upvoted this thread.   
I don't really understand the downvotes. 


I believe that this would be misguided. The reasons are non-obvious, but very interesting! 
Currently writing a detailed reply, which, is turning into something of an essay, and won't be finished tonight...
Basically, Bitcoin needs to be fool-proofed before it can be safely sexed up for mass adoption.
**Here's why:**
Murphy's law is a fundamental law of engineering. One interpretation of Murphy's law roughly states: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it."
It just so happens that almost every product of engineering we encounter is designed with this interpretation of Murphy's Law in mind. This is, incidentally, why every cell phone charger with a different voltage has a different plug, and why every wattage of lightbulb has a different socket. (Otherwise, half the population would brick their cellphone and blow up their lightbulbs within a week, and that's *only* considering cellphones and lightbulbs!)
Technologies that can't be idiot-proofed, like, say, cars, knives or guns or the *nix "rm" program are typically approached with some amount of fear and respect. Bitcoin is not designed "in compliance" with Murphy's Law, it's experimental, it's inherently complex, and if you are an idiot (almost everyone is, on occasion), it can and will cost you your money may and ruin your day.
**Some easy ways to ruin your day/year/life with Bitcoin:**
* 1:Formatted your HDD? Tough luck, you lost a million dollars.
* 2:You torrented an executable program from from ThePirateBay? Someone has your money.
* 3:You ran a java applet with a zero-day exploit. Your money is gone.
* 4:You trusted an online-wallet with your savings? That Service is offline. Indefinitely.
* 5:Your friend bought Bitcoin after seing them grow without limit on Bloomberg? He he's now in debt and his marriage is in peril.
* 6:Your brainwallet contains the change left over your transaction
* 7:Your brainwallet password is correct-horse-battery-staple and someone ran a dictionary attack.
* 8:A backup of an unencrypted wallet exists somewhere, and that wallet is recovered by someone.
* 9:You trusted some stranger on Bitcointalk with your money. (Oops!)
^(These are real examples.)
And then there are the scenarios where you yourself don't actively screw up, but your year is ruined anyway.
(Technological risk, legislative risk, market risk (competitors show up out-compete Bitcoin.)
Like a gun, or a root account, Bitcoin is a powerful tool. And, for the moment, any bitcoin client should be treated with the same fear and respect you'd affort a gun or a root account.

How can we know that BFL is not next in line to implode?
As for myself, Josh has demanded my apology upon delivery.   
He will have it; if, and when, it becomes clear that BFL is not a pre-order scam:

As it turns out, that apology would be... somewhat overdue, as they were *"close to delivering"* back in September, yet today, *close to four months later*, they don't seem closer at all, so far as I can tell.
BFL's CES perfomance doesn't do much to inspire much trust. If anything, the opposite.

FWIW, I believe Gavin has stated that usability, marketing, shinyness and so on is at (or near) the bottom of his priority list. (Market price being his least concern.) 
Bitcoin-breaking-bugs, end-user-security, protocol-level-security, scalability, and other important, boring, under-the-hood stuff decide whether Bitcoin *works* and as long as Bitcoin *works* AND someone, somewhere finds a use for it, that shiny marketing stuff will take care of it self.
At the current stage of development jumping into Bitcoin is really, really risky, and not everyone *should* be involved. It seems like adoption is already growing faster than the supporting infrastructure can keep up, and faster than (most/all?) developers would like. 
Bitcoin wasn't born perfect, but it *was* born running.
Consider the 250kb block size limit, the recent near-catastrophic hard fork, unspendable transaction outputs, and the MtGox bottleneck. There's a long list of issues on the "hard fork wishlist" on the wiki. More adoption now means less room to fix the painful-but-important things, less room for error, and also makes it guaranteed to hit the news if and when something goes wrong.
**tl;dr:** Bitcoin doesn't a marketing team. Yet. 
As long as *it just works*, it will *put a dent in the Universe* just fine without one.

A trader would surely know the difference between short-selling an asset, and exiting, or simply - selling - that asset. ( Using this term to mean simply "selling" has been a shibboleth of the bitcoin-speculation community since the Bitcoinica-era.) Shorting implies selling an asset which you do-not-yet-own, something everyone in finance would know, and - I presume - use correctly. (Because there is a world of difference between the two.)

No wonder... Notice that Micon fails to assume the proper ass-kissing stance.  
He also didn't ask the proper sort of fluffy questions that BFL will actually respond to.  
Good: ["Android Mining Software, that's so cool... Please talk about that for ten minutes, while I jizz my pants."](
Bad: ["What exactly is this box?"]( --&gt; Get thrown out by security.

Yes. As of January, months behind schedule, they are still advertising heavily.  
On Bitcointalk: [1] ( [2]( [3]( Google Adwords, and just about everywhere Bitcoin related. 
What's being advertised is: Plug-and-play mining systems, perfect for newbies (who will be ill-prepared to make a balanced judgement) and they make zero effort to point out that there are many sources of significant risk. 
On the face of it, it looks like a pretty good deal. 
However, Bitcoin mining is zero-sum, and every additional unit they manage to sell, but fail to deliver, reduces the marginal utility of every other unit. Now, if by some miracle, they're quickly able to ship &gt; 100000 chips, as they claim. 
What happens to their value proposition, from the perspective of the customer? [Left as an exercise to the reader.]
By every measure, they seem intent to squeeze the lemon dry, and they seem to be doing well at it. This whole mode of heavily advertising many-times-delayed, seemingly undeliverable, still-to-be-seen-or-tested-by-anyone-including-BFL products ([see photo]( to newbies, while [in flagrant violation of US Consumer Protection Regulation]( is, at best; cynical, irresponsible, and damaging to existing customers. 
Even under the best possible outcome, BFL fanboys will be getting a sour deal.
Added: bASIC ([now presumed dead]( was doing more-or-less the same thing, and didn't get enough shit for it.

How much is it and when can you deliver?  Do you accept pre-orders?

Hmm. Two steps forward, one step back.  (Repeat until World Domination.)

Bitpay is an awesome company, but they could get a skidmark on their reputation from the stink of BFL's shit.
A couple of quick  thought experiments: 
1: What would happen to Bitpay if something were to happen to BFL? Like, say, for example, there's another delay anouncement, all refunds stop, the forum gets locked down, the company gets "sold off" to nameless Asian benefactors. (Josh Zerlan and Sonny Vleisides disappear to Costa Rica or elsewhere.)
2: What would happen to Bitpay if every Pirate (BTCST) investment had been channeled through Bitpay? (Anti money laundering laws and all.)
I hope this ends well, but I'd be somewhat surprised. (I sure hope Bitpay knows what the hell BFL is doing, but since Josh Zerlan himself doesn't seem to have a clue, I wouldn't be too optimistic.)
