Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

I think they cast a slightly larger net for family than just direct offspring, but this is exactly why I ended up banking with Schwab too.

I wonder how many coins you would have to convert before they charged you.  Like, if a police officer sees you melting a single penny - they going to charge you?  10 pennies?  1000 pennies?

Why are you here?

Oh I wanted you to reply with the same image :(

A typical investment strategy is putting in $X every week or month for a year or 2 or 5 instead of all at once. If you're right about it being a good investment over time, volatility will be negated by your averaged contributions at set intervals and you will wind up in a good place.

So I can do either and still come out on top?

For some, exit point might mean certain personal finance thresholds have been met instead of what the current BTC price is.

Have to is not the same as "gotta" I suppose

That’s what letting other people complain about new bloods is for, medium blood

Yeah, that's definitely true.  I'm dealing with college level scientific papers - if the paper doesn't get the point across clear and concise, it's poorly written.  6th grade is a time to let creativity flourish.

The denominations are already named though.  Just like millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers.  They're already named, and we will use whichever one makes more sense.  We're not stuck with only one denomination for the rest of time.  
Why would you think it's easier to name things by decimals and fractions?  We don't say "dang that coffee was .01 dollars" we say it was 1 cent.
We already use different denomination names, why should BTC be any different?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:28:19
Yeah the whole graph would need to be adjusted for inflation to be meaningful.

Don't worry champ, go to bed.  It'll be back up to $2.85 in the morning!

I've neard "em-bit" too.  People will call it whatever ends up being easiest.  
Of course it's the same value.  Your original question was "why does it matter whether we call it 10 mBTC or .01 BTC?"  The answer is ease of use.  We don't measure short distances in 0.000189 miles, we measure it in feet.  The values are the same, obviously, but it's easier to use different denominations for different scales.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:38:16
We have words for $0.10.  Ten cents.  We have words for 0.01 btc.  10 mBTC.  Nomenclature matters - it's an ease of use thing.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:34:02
You just have to name the denominations.  If the value goes up enough we will be talking about prices in microbits.

I was watching Coinbase for several hours yesterday.  When I left work they were sold out, but when I got home they were selling at current price so I bought a bit.  Then 20 minutes later they were sold out again.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:49:54
Does coinbase have an option to invest in their company with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:16:11
And an oz of gold today is $1250 USD, he left that part off too.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:17:17
Ahh, thanks :)

As someone new to the world of grading student papers... I would ask you to turn in a regular version as a supplement.  It takes a long ass time to grade all those papers - and granted I'm only a poorly paid grad student drone - but I don't have time to go reading papers in mirrors.  Assuming I got a supplement, I appreciate the creativity.  Bonus points for creativity, minus points for unreadability.
