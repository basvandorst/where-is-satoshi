Congrats, great to hear this kind of story.

Yes this is looking very possible. Perhaps more volatility near expiration but the circuit breakers may tame that. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:25:29
Yes but the price will fluctuate if there is more buy demand than sell or vice versa.

Arbitrage long the basis for bitcoin is straightforward.   If the futures price is enough above the cash price you can buy bitcoins and sell the futures for risk free profit. 
Short the basis is more tricky as I’m not sure there is a reliable way to short bitcoin. 
Generally both sides would be needed to stabilize the price.

Nasdaq futures exchange (NFX) is completely different than Nasdaq stock exchange.  The trading volume of the NFX is tiny compared to the CME.

Thanks!  What is the expiration date of the one without the letter?  And also do these expire on the last day of the month or some other day?

What is zerohedge's agenda? (Serious question)

I’m not sure but I think it means  fear uncertainty doubt.

Interesting. What time period is the EMA you are looking at?

The problem is that the same name is being used to deceive people.

I don’t plan to do this but where can I short bitcoin?

Understood. The problem is that CB is providing a service that is difficult to find elsewhere. Can you give a few alternative options for converting BTC &lt;-&gt; fiat?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:57:04
It’s probably not over 10% anymore
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:42:33
Same for me. I don’t think you can adjust fees with breadwallet. I’m just waiting for confirmation right now...

You can't really put a bitcoin in the washing machine like you can with cash
