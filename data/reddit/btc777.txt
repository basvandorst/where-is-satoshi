I call BS. How dense do you believe folks are? Even 1 sat/B BCH transactions are confirming after an average of 5 minutes (yes, average 5 minutes after entering that transaction). 
Try this with Bitcoin Core where currently even 100 sat/B transactions are piling up and you have to wait for days.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:25:06
Imagine TX costs are going up to 500 USD and about 50 % of all Bitcoin wallets are unusable.  Then btc price will moon even more. 
Or not?

They are desperately looking for scapegoats why Bitcoin has stopped working as a means of general payment even for smaller amounts. 
Last thing they would consider is their own misjudgement. Now they have themselves locked in and cannot change position without losing face.

LMAO. "**Polluting** Bitcoin with ... transactions"
Either you are 15 years old and have still a lot of learning to do or we are getting a "Church of Bitcoin" which is attracting some pretty funny folks.
BTW: there aren't only "rich quickers" but also "rich slowers" who envisioned Bitcoin's potential when it traded around 6 USD.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:59:05
Don't worry! As we all know, Bitcoin is a stoooore of vaaaaaaalue (as long as its failure as a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" (Satoshi) doesn't wreak havoc with its valuation). 
Bitcoin's sinking percentage of total marketcap is the writing on the wall. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:20:44
I call BS. If you aren't color blind you can find out that 300++ sat/B are a result of users fighting for a place in overcrowded blocks. 
But as it looks,  whishful thinking seems to take over an undistorted sight on reality.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:03:55


Then they should shrink block size to 500 kB. 
This will produce even higher on-chain fees, which is even better. 
Or not?
BTW: looks like some folks have totally lost it.
Running Bitcoin into the ground. Future economy books will report about how 1st mover advantage and network effect was ruined by some folks who had not the slightest idea how markets are working.
My condolences.

@_date: 2018-01-24 20:12:19
They cannot increase block size. Because they have locked themselves up in a corner and don't want losing face. 
Once history books will tell this sad story how a first mover crypto currency was run into the ground because of an ignorant clique of non problem solvers. Who at best would have been able running a lemonade stand but not a wwide project like Bitcoin. R.I.P.

Currently BitcoinCash active addresses are growing 3x as fast as BitcoinCore active addresses. If this difference in growth is continuing BitcoinCash active addresses have reached parity after 3-4 month.

That's wishful thinking. Now even 20 sat/B transactions are flushed out. 
BCH transaction count is going up pretty steep.  
But keep on babbling about "bcash cult followers spilling the same bullshit" until btc is losing its first mover advantage. You deserve it.

You have been losing "some serious money"? Really? What it "serious"?  100 USD, 1000 USD, 10k USD?. What should people say whose portfolios have been going down by 10++ million USDs each? Did you hear a word from these folks, cry baby?
You didn't complain when shit coins went up 40% per day. Now you are crying. Looking for scapegoats, what about grabbing your own nose? If you cannot withstand the heat of investing in crypto then better leave. Because you'll lose your money anyway in the long run.
All those rookie "investors" who have witnessed raising valuations only are in for a healthy surprise: valuation street isn't a one way lane. Especially if you are "invested" in the shxttiest of shxt ICOs available.

Litecoin over the years has lost more than half of its value compared to BTC. Price of LTC most of the time has been less than price of BTC \* 0.03. That's the definition of a 'dead' coin. But I'm sure there are lots of believers who will deny these facts.

LOL. When I'm stabbing me now, nobody can stab me 1 year later. So I better should stab me now. 


Yes, it was a good thing for his personal wallet. But not for LTC's valuation &amp; prospects. It was a very bad sign for LTC's future because he had no more "skin in the game". 
But looking at the LTC chart, it became clear long before that LTC was going nowhere. At least when ETH reached parity to LTC in 02/2016 is was time to say goodbye. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:45:28
He is a master in feeding his gullible base of believers that stuff they love to swallow ("You're the man, Charly") without recognizing that they keep riding a dead horse. While the chief cowboy has dismounted. But crypto universe is stuffed with these folks riding droves of dead horses.
Good thing about current bear market is that this is cleaning up the landscape like a  huge shower is cleaning up a street which has been sh\*tted and vomited all over. When the shower is gone, we are enjoying fresh air and are ready for a new cycle of the same kind  ;)

Well yeah but that's a dumb argument because BCH transaction costs would still be orders of magnitude cheaper even if price of BCH were at the same level as BTC. Simply because even BCH TXs with below 1 sat/byte will go through without filling up mempool.

Nice try.
They don't like their own fiat paper trash. Instead they prefer solid money. Therefore they are paying you 2.25% to 2.5% interest, if you are "lending" your gold. 
How can they pay interest for a store of value medium which itself doesn't accrue interest? By using their printing presses.
And there will be one day, when administration will be ordering the "nationalisation" of that gold. So only stupid folks will fall for this trap.
