It *might* be a massive buying opportunity....or Bitcoin might be something with no intrinsic value that eventually is made obsolete by a similar product backed by a government.

Since when is a 25% variation in a few weeks not considered volatile?  That's way too risky for the non-speculative investors.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:02:28
I'm guessing yes.

There's something incredibly appropriate about using Batman to represent Bitcoin.

Wow....way to misuse Warren Buffett's words.  I can guarantee he would not touch BitCoin with a million foot pole.

Thank you!  My understanding of it was definitely at the ELI5 level, and that distinction was important for my understanding the decimal thing.

You don't budget well if $2M wouldn't be life-changing.
Also - at $20k, you should sell.  Absolute highest possible value it could achieve is $238,000, but that would require 100% adoption.

I think you just came up with a t-shirt slogan for Bitcoin.
I get that it could be practically infinite if coded to do so, but wouldn't that eventually put strain on computers?  I don't fully understand computer science to know what takes up memory, but working with Excel a lot, when I start getting hundreds of thousands of rows of data and a lot of calculations, it starts slowing down - I'm assuming any system that would maintain real-time ledger information on nearly infinite decimals changing hands would be a tremendous burden for modern-day computers - can this even work?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:33:43
This isn't over yet.  It hasn't faced the inevitable headwinds it'll face when it gets big enough to scare a major government.  There's already talk about the United States making it illegal.  You think that the government would be willing to lose what little control it thinks it has over inflation?  Plus...even if it maintains a legal standing and is adopted, what happens to all the government deficits when there's a finite money supply?  Or do we just keep adding decimals and make the whole "fixed quantity" aspect of Bitcoins pointless?
There's also the fact that only extremely intelligent people in the field of computer science or mathematics or the like understand this well enough to be comfortable with it.  Truly widespread adoption will be a huge leap of faith for a lot of people.
My guess is this is gonna crash below $500 a coin again within the next 3 years - not saying it won't survive long-term - the concept has a lot of promise, but nobody can possibly know how all these complex factors will interact.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:01:42
So there's no history of transactions?  Just current state and latest transaction?  (I'm starting to understand why this is so appealing to criminal organizations)
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:57:40
Apparently a flawed source - a Google search indicated there's $5 trillion in circulation currently, so I took $5 trillion divided by the 21 million maximum bitcoins.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:18:28
That is a really bad lesson to take away from that.  It's a sure-fire way to go bankrupt.  (that's not specific to Bitcoin - just that for every Bitcoin story out there, there are hundreds or thousands of busts you don't hear about)
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:58:35
Thanks!  I'm just thinking if we ever went to a global Bitcoin monetary system as our dominant system, we currently have about 7.6 billion people on the planet.  The top 1% control half the world's wealth, so that would leave about 10.5 million bitcoins for 7.5 billion people (rounding) - and that's assuming a similar distribution (I'm guessing Bitcoin is currently even more top heavy).  If each bitcoin is 100 million units, then that would be 140,000 satoshis per person.
Maybe that's enough...but if population growth trends keep up with the exponential rate from the 1900's, it won't be for long.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:02:39
Is there a concise read somewhere?  I have just enough computer programming experience to be considered "smart" to idiots and an "idiot" to real computer programmers.
My friend who is a genius with this stuff tried to get me into it years ago - set up my computer to mine, but it was too late for me to get in organically - never got any hits - and I was (and still am) too nervous about the long-term viability of this to invest real money in it even though I think the concept has potential.
I'm mainly just very curious about how all this stuff works end to end - like the computer science and mathematics of it all the way to the practicality of how transactions would work and the wallets would work and how can a financial system like this work when lost or broken hard drives actually remove currency from the system without the ability to increase beyond 21 million bitcoins in existence.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:47:29
Thanks for taking the time to explain this - had a fair number of rude or condescending responses, and it's nice to get one like this.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:20:19
I think this is a huge bubble, and that the value will collapse at some point, but if it doesn't, there's about $5 trillion in the world - if Bitcoin becomes the global standard, then 1 bitcoin will be worth about $238,000.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:54:22
I'd believe that - one of my friends lost a hard drive with some on them.  We don't speak of it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:21:09
Ah, thanks!  I misunderstood the comment.  If it's that traceable, why is it so popular with criminal elements?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:42
That's just silly - even if Bitcoin becomes the global standard and everyone uses it, there's only about $5 trillion in circulation right now and a maximum of 21 million (roughly) bitcoins - which puts the max value at $238,000 per bitcoin - account for maybe 1-3% annual inflation, and you're looking at a maximum of $263,000 in five years, and that's in a perfect scenario where it became THE cryptocurrency and the global gold standard....there's a lot to be resolved for that to happen - not least of which is achieving widespread acceptance and ease of use while avoiding angering a government and becoming illegal.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:28:19
False - I would've forgotten about this silly thing and lost the hard drive...
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:53:29
I trust your source - mine was the first return on a Google search, and I didn't validate it since it's just an exercise in curiosity with no real impact.

Bitcoin's value is driven by the wasted resources necessary to mine them.  It's bizarre, really....it's like a middle schooler saying "Hey, mom, would you buy me some Pokemon cards?"  The mom says "no."  The middle schooler then proceeds to whine and beg and expend energy until finally the mom is like "Fine, here's one pack."  The middle schooler then shows their new treasure off to friends and talks about how hard it was to get.  The friends then get the "Keeping up with the Joneses" and want that too, so they beg their parents to similar effect.  Supply grows, but demand outpaces it.  This is basically Bitcoin, but instead of emotional energy being spent, it's electrical and computing energy spent.  The scarcity is driving a demand frenzy.  I honestly don't know what to expect - it could have permanent and long-lasting value, but it just seems unlikely to survive because as soon as it's big enough to threaten the stability of a major government's currency, that government will attempt to kill it.
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:39:06
Yes - it seems the only thing humans actually place value on is destruction-caused scarcity.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:30:12
I think I'd do the same as you.  Ideally, I'd diversify between stocks and real estate primarily.  I'd consider Bitcoin to be speculation, and I would risk more than 10% on that, but I am curious about Bitcoin's future.  It's got a lot of potential, but I'm just pessimistic about how governments will try to kill it when it threatens to undermine their control over fiscal policy.
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:56:12
And the major disadvantage that it's digital - while improbable, in the event of a massive solar flare, Bitcoin is wiped out.  With Pokemon cards, I could happily play a game while sitting around the campfire in our post-apocalyptic world.
I honestly have no idea what to expect though.  It's been a long time since a currency came to life (at least in the United States) - the last example was the USD, and I'm sure that all the people holding wooden pennies and Confederate dollars probably thought that would never last either.  The entire concept of money is pretty fascinating to me.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:38:06
Neither.  I believe in hard work.

Sure, in that situation, but if someone is known to own a ton of BTC, there's nothing to stop criminals from capturing them an torturing them to get the private key and steal their BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:36:49
Is it just me, or does this seem like a really shady transaction?  Like....that must be a North Korea move or something....
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:06:04
You're overlooking a major Bitcoin flaw though - if you forget how to access it, it's effectively lost forever to you.  Also...pretty sure criminals could take Bitcoin by force if they really wanted to.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:45:46
False equivalency.

Not the same thing at all.  Stop contributing to the pump and dump.

Also, Apple isn't a threat to nation states monetary systems.  Even if Bitcoin stabilized and gained traction, nations would kill it with fire at the first hint of it destabilizing their own currency.

Yes, and everyone knows the first rule of speculative investing is that the stock history of a single investment can accurately predict the future 100% of the time.

I miss Gene Wilder...
Edit:  Wow...someone downvoted this?  That's just crazy.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:53:24
I completely agree with you, but I think the bad part is that part of its value is due to idiots thinking it's BTC and pumping up the value.  That's predatory, and would be eliminated real fast in a regulated environment.
But that's not what Bitcoin was founded on.  It's funny how all these idealistic tech folks create these amazing breakthroughs and then act surprised when they get twisted by the greed of humanity.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:42:42
...how is this even possible?
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:32:16
So....you'll be Mr. Bean?  'cause isn't he an idiot?
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:44:53
You remember how that whole scene goes, right?
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:34:42
I think people are starting to return to sanity.  Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but nobody seems to be dealing with the fact that no government wants to lose control over its currency system.  If Bitcoin gets too popular, governments will regulate it or destroy it.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:09:27
...and transferring the power to the technocrats.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:00:54
I'm pretty bearish on Bitcoin, but that's still shockingly dumb.  You can't even buy a soda with $1 these days.  At least with the 1BTC, you could immediately sell it for at least a few hundred dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:20:39
I would bet against a long-term trend.  Too many problems with sketchy exchanges.  Too much risk long-term because governments wouldn't be happy if this actually took hold and started threatening their currency.  Bitcoin is an idealistic pipedream.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:56:13
....and how'd that work out for him?
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:58:46
This is true of all investing, but Bitcoin isn't an investment - it's a gamble.  As much as Bitcoin is appealing from an improvement over the current fiat system, it will never be anything more than a gamble until there is no way another virtual currency could overtake it as the most popular and there is no risk that a government entity will outlaw it.  I don't see that as a likely situation, so for now, it's a gamble.
