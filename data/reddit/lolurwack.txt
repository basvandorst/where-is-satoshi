it also makes it much easier for people in smaller markets who don't have corporate banks throwing credit cards in their wallet at every opportunity

then why is it against their terms of service to use paypal with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:44:32
but why?
eBay has shown interest in crypto before, while Paypal is 100% against it.
Look at it like how Best Buy didn't use commission, but Future Shop did. Well, times are changing.

"Money in it?"
Bitcoin is money.
You are referring to currency.
You do not know the difference between fiat currency and what actual money is, so start there.

No I haven't decided anything. I know what the definition of money is.
Money is a commodity and is limited in nature such as:
Gold, Silver, Oil, Bitcoin
Currency is a tool of trade, and is often backed by money:
Dollars, Yen, Diamonds etc.
The reason currency is not money is because of Quantitative Easing or they can just print as much of it as they want causing inflation, something that can not occur with money. Measure Bitcoins in Bitcoins, not how much fiat currency they are worth. Bitcoins don't go up and down in price, people's faith in their economy changes and that's what affects the "price" of Bitcoin. It's a TRADE! 1 btc will always be worth 1 btc. How much is a USD worth compared to 10 years ago?
Edited for link to article backing my "outlandish" claims :D
a very good video on the topic of why paper is worthless and bitcoin has value
