Amazing. Please consider donating to a charity such as 
Suicide is the number one killer of young Australians between the ages of 15 and 44. Anxiety affects 1 in 4 Australians and depression is becoming more common than ever.
I have personally been through several stages of all of the above and would love to see a donation in support of mental health treatment and awareness. Thank you.

I purchased some bitcoin back in 2014, and currently hold them in a MultiBit classic wallet (Mac OS).
What is the best way to move my BTC to a modern wallet? I can only seem to export a .key file, can't see the private key?
Is Jaxx a good option? Am I able to export the wallet from MultiBit and open in Jaxx? 
If not do I need to send as a txn, if so what should the fee be?

I *wish* I could jump in. There's no option to buy at the current prices in Australia at the moment.
The two major trading websites are frozen at ~$119 AUD :(

 - frozen trading right now, 7.9% commission
 - as above, but 10% commission
As far as I know these are the only options to buy in Australia if you're not approved to trade on MtGox or you do an international bank transfer to one of the other markets.
...and of course the above traders are probably registered to buy on the other exchanges, currently hoarding coins at $65, then will resume trading at the $119 frozen rate...

Thanks - can I open a multibit.wallet and multibit.key file with either Copay or Electrum?

Exactly the same site. I think it even redirects to .com from .io

No they're not normal, but because there aren't many other options for Australians, these guys charge a premium.
