no im canadian. and ok.....fuck 1$ a week thats sweatshop money. So basically theres no way for me to earn bitcoins at this point, only to buy them? What price should I buy in at?

ok, if i am to ask someone for bit coins do i just send them my adress? How do i copy and past the picture like you see on peoples signs where they can just send it to that? my number is 1Ee5BkeP8Wd2ZA3mSKyJiKEq7Uhysknq2Y if i want to ask someone for bitcoins do i just copy and paste that? also what is the cheapest site to buy them?
edit - im on a site that says they are at 769$ each, is that correct? is that like a universal price or do people sometimes sell them for less?

but i mean, if you make 2x 20$ trades per hour, your still making 40$ per hour and that sounds really good to me!

so even if i spend hours doing all few hundred of them, i wont even make like 100$ per week? Im totally new to it im just installing my first wallet now. How do i buy them? is there another way? like I said I dont have much money, but i would really like to get into this.

awesome! Thank you!
So I see it is incredibly volatile - Say i want to buy in when its 20$ cheaper and re sell when its 20$ more expensive, over and over and over. How would i go about this??
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:34:10
why doesnt it work? Even if i just buy and sell at a difference of 20$ - say i buy at 820 and sell at 840, then rebuy at 820 and resell at 840....? There must be a way to do that?

also good thing i didnt take your advice - theyve dropped 60$ in value in the last 10 minutes
edit - 685$ now

oh, sorry im not entirely understanding the whole system. I heard when other people installed a wallet it took them a really long time, but it only took me a couple seconds. Does this mean i did something wrong?
