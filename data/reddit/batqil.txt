I think Bittrex has BTC/USDT. Also, if you're looking to keep USDT long term, consider a stablecoin like DAI instead

For info on crypto trading check out moominpapa and quickfingersluc on YT
For signals, moominpapa recommended coinwhispers and it's been good to me so far. They have a free channel as well so you can try stuff out
Also, consider staking with PoS protocols. There's a list here you can see [

Maybe meet with a good software dev company and they should be able to help you out

Well yes it's definitely easier. But the safer option is to store them privately.
Also, you learn as you do! So it can also be a good learning experience

Bittrex is likely to credit chain split coins, yes. But the safest option is to store your coins using private keys that you control.
I think this might be best explained in an example:
I had my bitcoin stored on electrum (private key 1). After the bitcoin cash fork, this private key 1 will have coins on both chains.
I moved the bitcoins to a new wallet (with a new private key 2) for safety purposes so in case anything happened to private key 1 while I was trying to recover bitcoin cash, I wouldn't lose my bitcoin as well
Afterwards, I used my private key 1 (that now has bitcoin cash) to a bitcoin cash wallet (a forked version of electrum). I did this by opening up the electrum cash wallet and entering the seed words for private key 1
That's it. Then I could move my bitcoin cash as I wanted

This is a pretty good question! I think you should maybe ask the companies' support team or post on their respective Reddit pages

Thanks so much for explaining! Really appreciate it :D

Yes that's right. Note that separate wallets means one wallet that operates using the original chain and the other using the forked chain.

Thanks for this! And what does it mean by "weight"?

Haahaa welcome to the world of bitcoin then my friend! Yes definitely do research and watch some videos

Adoption *has* in fact increased and this is still a relatively small at the moment compared to other forms of investment like gold. Personally I feel like this isn't a bubble but then again I'm not an expert :P

Technically coinbase owns your bitcoin because they control the private keys. That along with the fact that they can get hacked means you should keep your coins in online wallets for a short a time as possible
Your coins are most secure when you control your keys
