If Golem has a use then the platform it's running on, Ethereum, automatically has one too.

I'm personally fond of the original Bitcoin Entertainment System. The Super Bitcoin and the Bitcoin with 64mb blocks are nothing like the original.

And you stopped believing as soon as it dipped a bit?
Your faith was tested, son. :)
It's already almost back to 11k.

It seems like we are now well-above what this logarithmic scale was predicting. It predicted that the growth would be slowing down, and it's not.

A 50% crash still put it at $8,500.
We'll see how far it can crash. People may just sell to buy the next crypto, then buy back BTC. There are still a lot of people in this who bought at a much lower price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:28
Why is everything always much higher on Bitthumb? $19,772.70.

A company can say it has 10M in IT equipment, 2M in stocks in this other company, etc., I don't see what's wrong with saying they have $X in BTC. A big company like Microsoft for instance has a ton of shares in other companies.

If you sell some from time to time, then you can sell too early, sell at the top, and also sell too late.

Newspapers probably already wrote the article about Bitcoin breaking 20K in case it happens 5 minutes before they start printing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:58
I wouldn't be surprised that very depressive people put all their life savings into Bitcoin as a last gamble.
I hope investors learned something from the fact that it has crashed yet still recovered.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:08
It might rise to 40K then crash to 18K. Just random numbers here.
I bought in at around 5K and I'm just riding the waves.

Or, you know, BTC could go up 10,000% then go bust in 5 years because all the money is flowing to some alt.
  I would consider converting a significant amount of stocks, because that would pave the way to an early retirement (usual stuff, using a 4 or 3% safe annual withdrawal rule) while still keeping an important stake in Bitcoin (I know this is but I would still suggest diversifying to other cryptos too).

As of January 1st 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had grown annually by 6.94% over the last 10 years 6.69% over the last 15, 7.68% over the last 20, and 9.15% over the last 25. It's only a matter of perspective. You won whether you invested in 1992, in 1997, in 2002 or in 2007.
(This year has been very positive so the stats will improve a bit come January 1st 2018)

You could hodl for 2 years if you simply made a single transaction in that timeframe. Yes there would be the tx fee to pay, but you could move just the one satoshi to yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:23:45
I would totally retire on 2M but lots of people would never be comfortable without having a huge safety net. You can't change their nature.

Why did you invest if you don't think it will go beyond 11.3k?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:49:50
What really makes the story worse is that you did this last week.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:00:27
Yeah poor example, I just wanted an example of a bad situation. Basically, what are Bitcoins investors' worst nightmares. I'll change my text.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:40:34
I like to remind people of compounding interest.
17% a week is 351,289% a year (1.17^52 = 3512.89), aka Bitcoin at over 35M/BTC in a year.
The current volatility seems more normal than the ridiculous growth we were seeing just before.
If you see BTC at 100K in 12 months, then you should expect around 4.5% a week. With days at 10%+, there has to be days at -10% and below. Unless you see BTC at 35M.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:32:35
With the possible launch of ETFs and other investment products, if it goes to $100,000 then it goes to 10M. Growth begets growth, and ETFs would make Bitcoin investments mainstream and easily accessible to old rich people who won't have to think of wallets and that sort of things. People aged 50+ owns most of the world's wealth, how many of them are into Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:45:10
Shit, i bought Bitcoin Extreme in 2 years and I'm not freaking out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:19:54
I just don't understand how Bitcoin can be a better store of value than Dash or Litecoin. The latter two have gained a lot more than Bitcoin in 2017.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:24:58
AKA send to Monero then send to another Monero wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:47:39
Why not sell for $100,000 and at least have a rainy day fund? Have like 10,000 in cash and invest 90,000 in regular stock investments like Vanguard funds
Depending on which way you want to go with this, you could pretend you only had 10 BTC. 
  The fact you think she could just decide to leave her job is a bit scary.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:18:00
Random idea: what if the BTCs of wallets that haven't shown a single transaction in 2 years were redistributed to every other wallets (proportional to how many are held) or destroyed?
At least the coins wouldn't just be lost forever.
Also, something something Satoshi.
Another random idea: If you could set your wallet to autosend to another wallet in case there has been no transaction in x time. Would require the recipient to have a safe wallet and know a few things about cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:06:51
How much money would it take to have such an influence on Bitcoins' price?
  I think most people are buying btc because they see the price rising, and rising, and rising... FOMO becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It might keep going for a couple of years, who knows...
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:08:23
This, and if you're in it long-term, you shouldn't have to worry about 366 times the average daily volume being sold in 365 days. Of course the FUD could last for months, but long-term it wouldn't matter...

What is the point of using Bitcoin if Lifecoin or Dash can do the same thing but much faster?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:23:56
True. If you look at total market cap, it is still at 175B. This means a lot of money moved from alts to BTC.
However this sets up a new precedent and a new milestone for Bitcoin has been reached, so yes, as they say, this is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:21:51
Gold certainly has some intrinsic value, but most of its value derives from being kept in lockers...
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:43:47
It is lower than some things like Western Union, bank wires, etc. 
  But why use Bitcoins when some other coins are much cheaper and faster to move.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:24:06
  $1 going to two million dollars in two years? How many Bitcoin trillionnaires will there be!?!
I think that in a decade or less, the wealthiest person in the world will be holding a cryptocurrency. Ethereum growing 100 times would make Vitalik a centibillionnaire. We'll see.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:22:11
Whether crypto is the future or not, crypto becoming a part of an investment portfolio might lead to one of the biggest bubble in history. The average investors are dumb and they'll just see the numbers going up and that will keep going for a while until there isn't enough new money invested then it will crash. I don't like timing markets but this one seems so inevitable.
To the average cryptoinvestor who is already in, this is immensely beneficial in the mid-term. Even if it's a bubble followed by a crash, it could still mean increased recognition and validation of Bitcoin as a currency. Since no one can be sure when the crash would be, holding is usually the best option anyway.

Most investors have started recently so the moon has been redefined.  When it hits 100K, expect waves of new investors talking about a new moon. It's the circle of life.

What would happen if they kept the BCH, a massive lawsuit?
They're basically holding at least dozens of millions (USD) worth of BCH, no? Basically, an instant ~9% dividend (current value of BCH/BTC) of all BTC holdings that they were storing.

I think he's calling anything below yellow "blue category". So it's been in green for years, but never quite reached the deepest blue. The growth in the last years has been more linear (on an exponential scale).

Holy shit, I hope it was a really good haircut.

I don't care about market caps that much but that also means it's getting real close to 100B. Which will mean news outlets talking about Bitcoins which will mean it will go up rapidly some more.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:22:09
I'm starting to lose faith in Bitcoin over the long-term for these reasons.
Some of the other leading cryptos have improvements embedded right in their roadmap. Improvements will be necessary over time based on my understanding. What is funny is that people are buying Ethereum because it will be better, and people are buying Bitcoin because it will never change.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:55:01
It doves have intrinsic value (unfortunately) if it has miners and users. If the growth of Bitcoins (in terms of miners and users) can justify many forks, then it is like it is. 
  People don't understand what sets crypto prices. It's nothing but a pyramid scheme that never has to burst. It will slow down when there is less money going in. Money going in Bitcoin Cash and not into Bitcoin or alts make them grow slower, but it doesn't go down when the forks happen because investors aren't selling Bitcoin to buy the forked coin apparently. Is it rational? No.
If Apple split into two entities, then each would have a proportional value of the stock. That's because there are rules about splitting.
