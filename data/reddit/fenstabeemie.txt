My 2013 Blockchain.info password was scarily simple. No caps, no numbers, no special characters. So, no, there was likely no special pw requirements in 2012.

He's trying to one-up OP's tragedy though, which is what I found annoying. "I suffered worse than OP's brother, but I never considered suicide. Therefore OP's brother was mentally ill." WTF logic is that?

Imagine you want to send money to a friend or a customer or whoever. Currently, the most common way to do this is either to pay cash or to transfer through a third party (typically a bank, whether through a credit card payment or a bank transfer, or something like Western Union). Bitcoin (and other such cryptocurrencies) takes away the middle man. Sending money now is like sending an email (although even email typically goes through a third party like Google or Microsoft...). So if you value (or require) your privacy during these transfers, you can imagine why bitcoin is huge. It is difficult to follow the paper trail of your spending if you use bitcoin, because it is like "digital cash".
That's one advantage. Another is that bitcoin is kind of like gold. In the same way that the total amount of gold on the planet is fixed (so that a government cannot just "print" gold), the total amount of bitcoin that will ever exist is limited. Because of its scarcity, and as the number of users increase, bitcoin has so far proven to be a pretty good store of wealth. Its value in local currency, over a long time frame, continues to increase.
So not only is it "digital cash", it's also "digital gold". Corporations and governments that profit from people using their services to transfer or store money are unsurprisingly going to oppose bitcoin because it could potentially cut into their profits. There are other more complicated reasons, but this is an ELI5.

There is not even enough bitcoin for every *millionaire* to own 1 BTC.

If the market cap of bitcoin were to be around 30 trillion dollars (~ half the world's currency in circulation), the price of 1 BTC would be ~$1,800,000.

Oh wow a bot sighting in the wild. All of this user's posts are identical to previous posts.

Yes they lost a lot of money and if they had a time machine, I'm sure they would go back into the past and sell at 19k. So I'm not sure what you're suggesting be done. 
Should I sell my btc because the price has fallen? That doesn't make sense unless I'm sure it's going to continue to fall, which I'm not.

I've never lost any bitcoin, even though I've had some in a Coinbase wallet since 2013.

They're just kidding around because of you misspelling satoshi.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:19:14
Bragging rights. You're right in that "1 btc" is an arbitrary amount of bitcoin.

You're closer to the exception though. Checks are widely required and used in the US (for rent usually, but I've also gotten checks from friends that owed me some small amounts of money). The thing is, they are almost never used in most parts of Europe.

Just in case you weren't aware, this was pretty much the plot of the movie *The Big Short*, which followed a bunch of guys that shorted the housing market, i.e. they correctly predicted the 2008 market crash and profited greatly from it. 
What we're seeing in the original post here is people predicting a crash in bitcoin price.

Another way to look at it (this is not an original thought): it is impossible for every millionaire to buy 1 BTC.

Amazing to see it happening in front of our eyes.

They are two completely different things. First, personally, I don't think this is "good for bitcoin", because it reinforces the view of bitcoin as a shady currency used mainly in the darkweb for illegal reasons. The only "positive" I see is that it's becoming clearer to the mainstream audience that bitcoin is being used in the real world (even if by bad people) and not just by computer nerds.
The price dipping is unrelated, imo. It's a correction that most experienced bitcoiners would have expected given the sudden rise. In fact the price is still higher than where it was just a week ago. I expect the price to fall below $1500.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:18:58
The irony is that if the price does fall significantly now (say to around  $1200 or even $1000), it'll freak out anyone waiting for the price to drop, and they'll just be like "welp, guess bitcoin's dead. Good thing I didn't buy any."
And then the price will rise again. Rinse and repeat. Like fucking clockwork.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:34:26
I'm buying at $1450.

I sold some at 1800 with the intention of buying back at below 1500 because surely it was going to fall a bit, right?
Don't try to time the market, kids.
