You just pulled that out of your ass.

There is no personally identifiable information in a reddit username unless they use their real name as their reddit username, in which case, it is public domain.
  
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:22:42
You're doing it again.

Get back to work or I'll tell the guards.

Victory for whom?  Make sure you understand who you are serving with your actions and words, not doing so it to be nothing more than a tool.

Where did I say he owes me anything?  Seriously?  These are tactics that buttcoiners use when they try and argue.  Don't be a butt.

Sorry, I misunderstood.  I'm not aware of any stock photo companies that accept it.

Nice backpedal, not sure why you wasted the effort.

Very few artists make money from retail sales of their albums.  How about ask what their cut is of a retail sale of the item they just ripped off and pay that?
  
If they get enough this way, they may decide to sell directly to the public on their next album if they are allowed to do it contractually.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:56:53
Based on what?  
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:18:58
Coinbase is compromised?
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:11:23
Tipping is the future and it is not going away.  Your attempts to put rules on it is foolish and a waste of your time.  Instead, look at what people are giving away by collecting a tip and the implications of that.  ChangeTip is a Big Data gold mine, it bridges a gap in the information war and will always have a state sponsored solution for collecting that information.  Operations to promote its use will come and go and they aren't going to adhere to any rules.
  
People should be worried about the lack of competition in this space and the lack of a decentralized and open option.  
  
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:53:25
People will believe it too.  Simple fact is that you cannot disrupt openly like that.  He will be completely ineffectual as he will be blocked at every attempt since his motives are in the open.  This is nothing more than a childish play for attention.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:59:15
You have acknowledged two things in our dialogue.
  
1) Cody will be ineffectual(blocked) as a Member of the Board.
  
2) A lot of people are talking.
  
You have confirmed he is wasting his time and that we are wasting ours.  I see that you do not agree that we are wasting our time and that is where I will stop wasting mine. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:39:13
Thanks for taking the time.  Sounds like that person really believes it.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:30:40
Now do one for the opposite effects of a successful bitcoin.  Increased government regulations, choking of avenues to obtain bitcoin further stagnating the price, mining reward halving with a choked price pushing out a lot of miners and causing further consolidation etc..
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:04:42


  
Bitcoin is not illegal.  If it was, they wouldn't be auctioning them off.
  


  
I actually agree, but innocent until proven guilty...
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:36:23
I love your username. :)
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:24:52
You could have at least used another account that didn't prove you're a buttcoiner.  
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:30:08
Yes, it is worth it as long as bitcoin succeeds.  It may seem small now, but if you do it steadily over a large time-frame, it will grow and you will be happy you did it.  
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:50:53
It says in your confirmation email.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:44:01
Legality aside, it is pretty shady when regulators create regulations so confusing that only a few people understand how to navigate the system and then they go work for big paychecks helping companies navigate the system that they helped create.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:05:33
Thank you for your concise analysis, CeasefireX.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:15:13
Then you have no choice but to wait and hope for the best.  If it goes down in price, just buy some more and make your purchase.  Whatever you do, do not ask your bank to reverse it or you will get your account flagged with coinbase and they are a reliable outlet for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:49:39
Create a bank account just for this with a different bank and disburse from that account.  Bitcoin has opposition, proceed in a way that always gives you a fallback.  
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:28:57
I can't find the link on my mobile but there is a redditor around here who put a BIP38 wallet on imgur with a 4 character password.   To the best of my knowledge it hasn't been cracked.  4 characters should be easy to remember and the Internet has a good memory.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:41:37
Cloud Mining is a scam.  You are always better off buying bitcoin with the money instead.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:09:00
What are you buying?  It may very well fall by then, is this something you can't buy with cash?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:39:28
Why on earth would you black out their name?

Colbert is definitely a robot.  A guy named John Stewart invented him in his basement because he wanted a friend.

You're being intellectually dishonest.  This submissions headline matches the sources, it has nothing to do with the ethics of this sub, it is factual redistribution of knowledge.

I'm envisioning some sort of [Cryptex]( device that is also a watch. ;)

Then freaky should have kept the private correspondence private.  He didn't, now I'd like some more info.   Freaky said he is afraid he would be breaking rules, he wouldn't be, so what's the excuse now?  
  
And this is the first time I have heard about users private messaging other users out of the blue to warn them about bitcoin.  The whole thing smells.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:39:19

Don't bother, he will spin whatever you say to be a negative and resort to straight up laying to achieve it.  Your replies are the fuel for his fire.

The whole system is built to rely on middlemen.  You forgot about the miners.

If you can prove that a populace voted a certain way, you can make the arguments in their direction.  This cannot work without a verifiable identity system so that there is provably no double spending of votes.

Applepay isn't growing a new technology.  It's not creating a new niche market out of thin air, it's another iteration of systems we have seen operating in Japan and elsewhere for many years now.  Its been through beta.
  
You cannot compare ApplePay to Bitcoin, they are not the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:01:59
It's an op to enumerate outliers.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:00:38
Cloud mining?
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:17:50
There is nothing artificial about it.  They're usually about a dollar more than the price on bitstamp.  That is because when you buy from coinbase, they buy the coins on bitstamp.  They are not an exchange connecting buyers and sellers, they are a broker.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:52:07
You are allowed to post reddit usernames.  It is public information.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:03:48


  
That is incorrect.  When the act of resisting is ineffectual, it is a drain on resources and it demoralizes the audience.  Resistance can work against the resistors when not done correctly.  Cody is not acting in our best interest, Cody is acting in Cody's best interest and the interest of his Brand.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:42:46
Nobody can really know if it's going to succeed so you should operate like it can fail at any time.  Maybe 5-10 dollars is all the risk he can afford.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:51:27
In order for you to make a profit from cloud mining, the mining company would have to eat a loss.  They would literally be giving away money.  
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:51:52
Did you say what they tell you to say on the libertyx site?
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:04:11
ChangeTip is a smart bridge in the information war.  *They* are able to correlate reddit accounts &gt; 3rd party accounts &gt; IP &gt; blockchain addresses and innumerate so much information.  And starting January of next year, everyone will be paying for them to spy on themselves, it's genius!
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:00:03
What do you find amazing about block-chain?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:47:16
You are allowed to post it because their username is public information, please post the username so we can look at their history.  It's personal information you are not allowed to post, like real name, address etc..
@_date: 2014-11-10 13:10:46
freakyfancy is not your average user.  They've submitted almost 500 threads and made almost 500 comments since creating their account 25 days ago.
That is not normal.

This makes no sense because if there is heat on you, you walk away, shut it down.  You don't convince someone to come back so you can frame them and they get arrested and spill everything.  The whole premise is dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:41:30
It forces you to make a decision.  Do you stop and try to see who's coming, run like a bat out of hell or proceed like you don't hear them and hope for the best?
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:21:30
I'd rather not contribute to them.  They get nothing from me.

I found part of what I assume is a priv key etched into some newish construction at the Precedeo.  I spend every weekend scouring SF for the rest.  GG is the next big area I need to hit wrapping around through Sunset Beach up to Fort Funston.
Im willing to collaborate if anyone finds a string that looks like it could be part of a priv key.  I'm going to be pissed if I find the beginning and it starts with a 6.

If they dropped the charges and he did nothing wrong then why did he have to pay them anything?
  
Why isn't he suing to get the stolen funds back?
@_date: 2015-09-18 01:29:47
One email is not evidence they are fighting reform.  They are clearly fighting to maintain control of the sharing program, the States don't have as much control or profit as much from the sharing program so of course they fight it.  But it needs to be fair and the feds participate too.
  
When I see evidence that they are fighting against reform of forfeiture conditions in terms of prosecution status, I well then pause.
@_date: 2015-09-18 01:16:43
Did he pay them the money or did they just not give it back?  That seems like an important distinction and it isn't clear to me.
@_date: 2015-09-18 01:11:40
It would be more believable if this happened on a State level and not with a Federal Agency.  Asset forfeiture on the State Civil level is definitely being abused and there is plenty of documentation for that.  But on the Federal level things are different and there are more checks and balances and distribution is different, it trickles down all the way to the State Civil level when distributed so there isn't the incentive like there is at the local level.
