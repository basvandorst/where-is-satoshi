Lol. 
A emp large enough to burn flash drives will cause problems that will make digital currencies the least of your problems. 
If you are really that worried about ti, wrap your flash drives in foil. Problem solved.

What is this?

I am not sure what you mean with "again". I was the very first comment on your post. I had no way to know that your power is free.
Alright, then you have nothing to loose in this effort. So, mine away. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:23:30
Neat. 
I have access to a epilog laser. It scans way different than that one. 
What type of laser if that?

The response to "We know who you work for" is "Really. Why didn't you say who I work for in the original threat you POS."

ehh, fuck the daily chart. Shit like this happens a lot. 
No big deal.

yet some people are still paying $10 for those 330 mh/s erupters.
I don't understand why those thing hold their value better.

You could probably substitute the reasons used to pro bitcoin back in the day. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:19:05
I sold a bunch of these a while back. I kept one for myself as well. 
It's just that people seem to be buying these like crazy still. 
I don't get it. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:20:04
Just make sure you only sell "sha256 asics", and everybody will be cool. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:09:34
Alright. 
I wasn't suggesting otherwise. 
But yes, if you live by a techshop, the places are pretty cool.
If you do not live by a techshop, you could always get this done by ponoko:

Sorry to hear about your brother. 
I have used these guys in the past: 
They do good work. It may be a few grand to recover the data.
It's possible he kept a backup of the wallet elsewhere. You might look through any flash drives, or any written cd's/dvd's he had.

You are likley using more power than is the power you are consuming.
cost/value analysis is something that everyone has to work through themself. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:27:14
No, as with any investment, buy low and sell high. If you make money, don't look back. 
Not everybody is you. 
That being said, I haven't sold. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 06:21:01
Express interest in it. 
Read forums.
Play with code.
Understand the math. 
Go to meetups. 
Maybe go to conferences. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:48:19
So you are saying it would be more humid in the room? 
Probably not worth worrying about considering the high humidity in Florida. 
Also, what;s the lifetime of a miner, probably not high. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 18:39:09
Having rented several units. Yes. 
That's also the reason why most rentals have the shittiest appliances and carpet. Because you would never recoup the repair costs from the time deposit. 
Renters can easily do $20k-$50k in damage to your place. 
Just repainting a place can run several grand. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 18:54:13
Yes, me too. 
You and I both live in a country with a relatively stable banking system. We can do most everything we need to do without physical fiat cash. 
In some places like India, you cannot buy most things if you do not have the cash for it. No credit or BTC accepted. 
So, many people there use the bank of "shove it under the mattress".
This whole situation makes life a lot harder for some people there. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 06:02:38
If it's my Canada vacation home. It would probably be a lot better for me to pay the $10k to not need to have it destroyed by renters.

Not to take one side or another, but isn't that a terrible comparison? cell networks are not built to accommodate the reasonable max load by a lot. Nearly anything significant happens anywhere and cell networks shit a brick.

Not sure why you say "leftist". 
@_date: 2015-09-21 17:25:09
It's true, not sure why you are getting downvoted.

I worked for their competitor, Verifone for a while.
Igenico is going to destroy them. The Igenico offering is dramatically better.

I suspect it is cat 5e or better given that the cheapest stuff you can get is cat 5e at this point.
Also, dropping a frame or two on ethernet isn't too big of a deal, you just get a degradation in bandwidth, and a retransmission. 
bitcoin mining isn't exactly a high bandwidth activity, so, you have a lot of overhead in bandwidth to give up. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:02:00
The crosstalk on the cables won't be a issue. We have large network bundles in every large datacenter I have been in. It's not a problem. It's all differential signals on twisted pair.
The rest of your points are valid. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:50:17
Thanks for the video. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:21:05
It's taxable now. Just as is any equity you may buy and sell. 
I bought bitcoin in the past, I sold some this year. I'll be reporting it to my tax person at the end of the year. I realized a gain in USD. 
I'll pay taxes on that. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 03:46:20
What is to teach? Buy low, sell high through a exchange. It's like any other equity.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:52:30
The twisting and differential signaling make UTP stand up to environment noise pretty well.
Noise has to be extremely bad to cause issues with ethernet, and you first start seeing problems in running the cables as far as you would like.
A lot of network equipment can have some amazing amount of noise rejection on the order of 70 db. 
Data centers all over the world frequently have cable runs with 100+ cables all wrapped together in them without issues. 
Those runs are typically done above head level, and not on the ground like this, but the cables on the ground shouldn't have a significant degradation in performance.

I would be inclined to write a letter to these guys asking them to specify reasons for making their request. They didn't provide any reason for the request. 
If they provide some bullshit reason, say because of suspected suspicions of fraudulent activities, asking them to cite their reasons for these suspicions, as you are rather concerned about participating in suspicious activities. 
Also. Do not go into to bank to talk to them. You probably want a paper trail for this one. 
In the mean time, is there some daily transaction you can do with coinbase that will not cost you anything? I suspect that this bank is feeling threatened. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:23:18
That's frustrating. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:20:09
A metal surface doesn't create heat. 
It may feel hotter to you because it's conductivity is much higher. ie, the metal surface might feel hotter because it transfers more heat to you faster. 
Here is a good video on the subject I suggest you watch:
Okay, so, the large piece of metal makes the OP's miner cooler because it has a lot of surface area to spread the heat over. That superior surface area can transfer heat to the environment it's in better than the smaller heat sink. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 06:51:16
Cool. 
Looks like a fun build. 
Two things though. 
1. Those ir temp sensors read low on reflective surfaces. Corroborate your numbers with a contact sensor.   
2. I just let mine run at 60C+ I do not care that much. Most chips will work rather well at 80C for most of their lifetime. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:16:44
Okay. 
I've had a greater disparity with reflective things in the past. More like 30%. 
Anyhow, it's something to keep in mind in the future. 
Like I said, that looks like a fun build.
