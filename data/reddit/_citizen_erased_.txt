I don’t think the number of internet users should determine the multiplier. Many many users today can’t afford to invest. Also, many big investors did not use the internet during the dotcom bubble.  10x is just a pulled out number. If a supercomputer could somehow calculate what you’re trying to do here, it could be 2x or anything else. Cool idea though.

@_date: 2017-03-18 18:19:56
Coinbase does suck. They go down with every major price swing. I was barely able to buy there today. My account is pretty old and established, but I had to wait several hours. I suggest you keep your account there, but also open one with each of the major platforms. Do it now even if you don't need it right now. When the day comes that you need a verified bitstamp, Gemini, etc. it will be waiting for you.

You downplay my simple analysis, yet the very prices you named... 1600 and 900, are pretty much exactly the top and bottom line on my graph right now. I don't buy or sell based on that log chart. I only used it to show that we are not in a bubble. If we "crash" it's 900 at the worst. Still inside the tube. 1700 would have me worried, and anything above that is bubble territory. That's all. Falling to 900 right now would be alright.

If you are a brand new player, get something in the $200 range. Today's starter guitars are extremely good compared to what was available in the old days. Plus, when it's time to upgrade, it won't break the bank to get something nicer. For now, put that extra money into bitcoin.

Switch to logarithm chart. We are not in a bubble. The fair price at the time of the GOX ATH would have been around $55, so 1200 was a bubble. A bubble of that magnitude right now would take us around 30K

Things that grow exponentially cannot be understood by looking at their growth in a linear perspective. Take Moore's law for example. Computing power doubles every two years. It always has. I remember not long ago when 8gb SD cards were impressive. What is the standard now? 128gb? 256?
If you take one penny and double it every day for a month, how much will you have at the end of the month? Over 10 million dollars. You can't graph that in a linear way. It goes parabolic. If you look at each increase as a percentage of the previous day, then it's just a line. A totally predictable line that makes sense.

Relax. Don't file a chargeback. You haven't lost a ton of money. Coinbase is not instant until you set up your account properly. I have sent them pictures of my ID and I have multiple payment sources on file. That is how you go Instant. I'm sorry, but whatever you were planning with that $500 needs to wait now. The price of bitcoin will go back up soon. I suggest that you de-stress and make the best of this situation.

Best time to buy bitcoin is every payday. In my case, that never corresponds with a dip. Somehow a bubble has to show up every time.
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:38:23
2k later this year is not that crazy. The growth in the last 6 years is absolutely insane, why do you think it would stop? It's accelerating over time, and hopefully it will continue to do so. The bubbles should be disregarded as momentary deviations from the true price.

Any order that completes right away is a market order. That’s literally the difference between the two types. Orders that stay on the books (even for one second) and orders that are executed immediately. Remember, I’m speaking specifically about the GDAX trading interface. If you put a limit order that would execute immediately it will give you an error message. 
Now, poloniex for example is different. You control wether you are a maker or a taker by the price you type. If you are buying above market price it will execute immediately as a market order. (Taker) and if you try to buy below market price it will sit on the books. (Maker) aka limit order. I hope that clears it up. GDAX requires you to switch between order types, and gives an error if you are on the wrong side of the current price. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:07:23
Those are not market orders. I already said limit orders are free. Market maker is a term used to describe the use of limit orders. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:40:55
GDAX is super easy, especially because your login info from coinbase is good there. The main reasons that coinbase has fees is because you can only do market orders. Market orders on GDAX has fees, but not as high. Limit orders are free.

Yes that's a real danger. I wish we could all brainstorm together to come up with some simple checks and balances to prevent this kind of thing. IMO a purchase of $800 like the one you described is pretty rare for most people and would have to have some confirmations at my store. For larger purchases of say .1 or more the customer would have to register with a valid phone number and show their ID so I could turn them in easily. The case would be open and shut, and yes it would be a hassle, but most people would not try it if they knew that getting caught was likely.

Compared to what? All the ATHs of the past are due to some BS or another. If there was no craziness, and no pumps due to weird circumstances, then BTC charts would look like a slow steady climb. Every day would be a new and boring ATH that's 40 cents higher than yesterday.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:46:21
I’ve heard this exact same crap since $1. 
For one thing, angry internet guy, market cap does not equal the total investment in crypto. The actual fiat exchanged for coins is way lower. Out there somewhere is a guy that bought 500 coins for $500. That contributes a total of 4.1 million dollars to the market cap with only $500 actually invested. So chill out. And I never said it’s definitely going to one million, but 20k did sound ridiculous to most people 3 years ago. Maybe you weren’t around for that, I don’t know. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:18:56
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:00:26
Well, at the most basic of analysis, yes. They are over 1000x higher than when I first heard of them. They only need to go 28x higher to get to 50,000. Even considering that the growth hits diminishing returns in the future, it's not far fetched at all to hope for 50K even within the next 10 years. I think a million per BTC is pushing it though. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:15:24
You're the best kind of noob in the world. Just keep buying as much as you are able to invest comfortably. No trading, no selling, just keep making your future self rich. When they're 50k+ it will all be worth it.

All those daily change red numbers are showing the price of the coin RELATIVE to bitcoin. Not relative to USD. That's very important. If bitcoin jumps 20% and they don't, this is what it looks like. It's not an alt crash. Even the stupid trollbox doesn't comprehend this. I don't care, all my -20% buy orders got filled and when bitcoin falls all my +20% sell orders will fill.

It's the best of both worlds! Give me more countries throwing fiat at this thing. This shit is awesome. People hate on alts. Go buy a dip and sell the recovery and pay no attention to what happens otherwise. It's a money machine, and there are 65 of them on polo jumping up and down all day. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:08:10
Well as you probably know, every wallet is nothing more than two encrypted strings of characters. The public key is like the account number, and the private key is like the password for that account. There are more possible wallets available than atoms on the sun, so you can have a million all to yourself if you want. Every coinbase transaction generates a new wallet. They give you the public key and they keep the private key hidden away. If you want a wallet with control of the private key, you need to generate it yourself. You can download the Bitcoin client on your computer if you want, and have full autonomy over your coins. You could then generate wallets and initiate transactions and all kinds of fun stuff. There are also some websites that will generate wallets for you and hand over the private key for you to print out and stick in your fire safe. Another option is having a piece of standalone hardware that functions as a wallet. These are common and can be bought or built by yourself. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:57:49

Wow, the assumptions run deep in this one. Did I already sell it? How much of my bankroll is there? Have I bought back on a dip yet? Did I buy an LTC dip and ship that to Polo? Was it just $50 worth but I already got it up to $70? So many possibilities.....

Others say discounts, but I was referring to the fact that the value of BTC is likely to always be higher down the road. Still, making any purchase with BTC is one more brick in the road to adoption. If a business offers BTC as a payment source, and nobody every used it, it might go away.

In some way or another, every single one of us missed the boat. Some worse than others, but we are all in this together. HODL until retirement people. You can do it.

Lol, never mind you're right. If BTC went to 10 million, alts would just wither and die. Forget about 'em. Nobody would but those stupid things.

It's horrible. I made a thread exactly like this over there not too long ago. It gives me headaches. Just ignore as many of these spammers as you possibly can. The shitposting is definitely out of control.

Coins get mined and put up for sale. That is money flowing into crypto. They haven't just always existed in their current state. I remember about 8 years ago there were 0 bitcoins available, and now over 16 million have been sold several times over. The same coins get sold for higher prices than they were bought. If you bought one for $1 in 2011 and sold it for $2,800 this month, to a complete noob that deposited fiat onto an exchange for the first time in his life, that is $2,799 "flowing into crypto" right there. Think about this stuff. That money came from his paycheck directly into the market, without any money leaving the market, because more than likely the seller waited for a dip and rebought.

That's the best kind of approach.

That's why you need to buy 1,000 times more right now.

Also, a few million of the coins could have been purchased for $50 several years ago, and now they are worth billions. Yet they have not been sold for billions. That money has not actually entered the market. It's potential dollars, not actual dollars invested.

That would be amazing. I would never sell completely out, and I know many people would not either. It would be prudent to buy up a lot of alts with your profits too in case a different coin picked up mass adoption due to the overpriced BTC.

It says you can't operate as an unlicensed exchanger directly from your coinbase account. Just move the coins elsewhere and then do whatever business that you are legally allowed to do. Just don't do it from a wallet that they control, that's all they are asking of you. The real question is, do you require a license to sell on localbitcoins? Is that a law?
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:40:40
Whales and margin trading. Gambling. Gamblers are strangling BTC. If everyone were just holders it would steadily climb for everyone, but greedy risk takers are repeatedly picking the market up and body slamming it over and over trying to squeeze their own selfish fortune out of it.

Some things are quite literally above the law.

Good luck with that. The anti-deflationary flagship coin.

It's not that simple. Nobody anywhere can just randomly open a business without a license. Anything above a yard sale or a craigslist ad really needs to be cleared with the government first. Coinbase and other exchanges would greatly appreciate if everyone moved their coins to private wallets before engaging in private ventures with their bitcoins. It makes perfect sense to me. Just get the coins out of their custody and THEN do your possibly illegal stuff with them. Liability and all that. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:14:13
You know how people on here always say "if you don't control your private keys, you don't really have your coins" and all those types of sentiments. I see this as just another extension of that philosophy. We were always meant to be in full control of every aspect of our own Bitcoin. There are even P2P exchanges popping up where no one is the boss or the rule maker. Coinbase is a private business, and as such, has the right to make all kinds of crazy demands, just as we have the right to go elsewhere. So I don't find it silly at all that I can buy some crypto there, but I need to take it off-site before I exercise my freedom to operate as a mini-exchange. Your wallets on coinbase are after all, not really yours in the literal sense. They belong to a corporation.

Take that 600 and buy back in with your profits.

They could never buy it all. Never

Not as profitable as low-risk trading.
