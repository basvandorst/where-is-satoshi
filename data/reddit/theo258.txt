Then whats the point if it can be traced back and the government can put rules its only a matter of time before the irs start to controlling it. But i i received 50 btc can the irs just come and force to pay taxes because of the bitcoins and i get these bitcoins from a friend not a business

hey man i'm also 15 but i don't have a job but i'm steadily investing into bitcoin but i mostly buy through paxful it takes $5 worth for any transfer to an outside wallet its crazy but if your parents do agree ide like to buy directly for you to avoid the rediculous transfer fee by now you should know how difficult it is for people like use to buy bitcoin
