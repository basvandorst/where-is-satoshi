Oh lmao, my bad.

The connection is far less nefarious than your claim makes it out to be. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:55:46
This is extremely weak evidence for the claim you are making.

How much of his funding comes from IHS? When did the Koch brothers become fascists?
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:36:51
The only information I found to support your claim is that the Rubin Report is an IHS Project and Charles Koch is one of many on the IHS Board of Directors. If that’s your evidence, it’s far less nefarious than you’re making it sound.

Oh ok, so you don’t have a shred of evidence to support your claim. Just as I suspected.

This is one of the single best use cases Bitcoin has ever received and the response is tepid because the NPCs of Reddit have been brainwashed into believing he’s an “alt-right Nazi.” Seriously, listen to this guy for just 5 minutes and tell me if he says anything that aligns with what you’ve been told.

Can you provide me with a source for a single one of your claims?
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:20:37
People on Reddit won’t care because they generally agree with the bans.

What puts him on the “fringe”?

Casual sex isn’t risk free. Wow, I’m floored that he said this!
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:34:40
So what?
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:58:42
I bet you can’t provide a single source for any of the slanderous claims you’ve made against him. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:26:00
Because I’ve probably listened to 100 hours of JBP lectures and I know the guy I’m responding to is an NPC regurgitating the falsehoods he’s been told.
