lol, GitHub is a piece of shit.  It's more like the un-wiped asshole of the "open source development community".
This is like saying wikipedia or ted talks are the very heart of knowledge.

Jesus christ, moron faggots like you are the reason this country is so fucked.  You fucked off for SIX MONTHS and still haven't figured out who's fault it is?

If you're so starving and broke how are you going to afford the $60+/month data plan?  
If you can afford that, but have no phone now because you're so broke, you could easily save up and buy one in a couple months.  The hardware is cheap.  If you have all this spare money every month why are you hungry?
Also no one is going to get a smartphone and suddenly become a photographer, filmmaker, writer, coder, or musician.  What the fuck is wrong with you.
It's a device that can make phone calls and browse the web poorly if you pay a bunch of money every month.  You know what else can do that for a lot cheaper?  A fucking pay phone and the free computers at the library.  
If you're literally so poor that you're hungry, you cannot afford a fucking cell phone and you really really don't need one at that point.

7 transactions per second, 4GB per day of blockchain bullshit.  
Currency of the future.

Less biased reviews on a "documentary" that does absolutely nothing to investigate or educate about bitcoin?  
The entire thing is just a fan service feel good jerkfest for people who have already made up their minds.

| solves some mystery of Computer Science that has baffled people for nearly 100 years
Jesus christ this couldn't be farther from the truth.  Not only did he not solve any "mystery of computer science", but his "solution" isn't really effective for doing anything beyond an academic proof of concept.  It should have never ever been used as a basis for a currency processing network.  By design it is impossible for it to scale to any level of actual usefulness (for any real task, especially not as a transaction processor).
He should have demonstrated it with a stupid chat app or something, left all the currency shit out of his dumb paper and been on his way.  No one would have cared and it would have been glossed over like every other academic pursuit that has no use in the real world.  
Instead you morons got hooked on some idealistic get rich quick free money fuck the government bullshit and are just digging yourselves deeper and deeper into a system that is defective by design.

If your name was on the mortgage, you should have been making sure payments were being made.  How could you be so irresponsible?
Yeah the bank totally fucked you.  They must have not looked at their chart and seen that 17 years of payments means it's okay not to pay for 6 months.
You fucked the bank by not paying, and they needed their money back to continue to operate.  How do you think the bank afforded to buy your house in the first place and then allow you to pay them back slowly over a long period of time?  It surely wasn't because they gave a free pass to all of the other people paying back loans.

Amazon doesn't actually give much of any discounts, even to their top 10.  These clients can work with amazon in other ways, for instance to make sure they have capacity in certain places ready when they need it.
You're on the right track though.  If you just need a couple moderately powerful servers and nothing more than some bandwidth, AWS isn't really any cheaper than coloing equipment or even managed hosting.
The real value in AWS is the *MASSIVE* amount of other shit they offer, which is all controllable through their API.  As soon as you start needing more complicated environments, private networks, firewalling, load balancing, VPNs, DNS, varying storage requirements between servers, storage snapshotting and offsite storage, logging, monitoring, etc is where the real value of AWS is.  Plus you can do all of this in a bunch of locations all around the world, and setup and monitor everything programmatically through their API.
There is a massive value to being able to write some shit to fire up full environments in datacenters all over the world without having to deal with shipping a bunch of servers and half a rack of network equipment, while negotiating bandwidth and power, etc.  They also make other shit like billing very simple, which can get complicated if you're physically placing equipment globally and have to deal with all that internally within your company.
That said, they also make it very easy for idiots to design shit environments, and that says nothing for the crap you run on there.  Removing the barriers to entry to deploying these kind of environments has led to a lot of negativity, but overall there is a massive value to services like AWS and Azure.

No, it has had that forever.  Scammers and con artists have also existed forever, however regardless of currency transactions have always existed in the form of I'll give you this if you give me that.
Go back far enough and humans did hedge bets against each other, however at this point it was also very difficult to collect goods and then just disappear.  Most people weren't stupid enough to enter into a deal, and then turn over valuable property without receiving their end of the deal-- this had to happen in person.
Multisig escrow will not fix any of this.  There is nothing that can fix the gap between me sending you bitcoin and you sending me the goods.  The only way to remove the one sided nature of this is we meet face to face and exchange goods, but who wants to sit there for hours waiting for confirmations?

You pay your mortgage/rent, all of your utilities, and buy your food with your slow shitty deflationary bitcoin?
The fed is good.  Inflation is good.  You're a fucking moron, but at least the government money is so easy to use.  Oh wait no, it's way easier just to download a 19GB file so I can operate my wallet.

If someone is taking 40% of your sales just to process payments it's entirely your fault for being too fucking stupid to figure out how to take money from people.

That's a lot of effort and complaining for some shitty fast food pizza.
