Sometimes, you have to go to extremes. I had one dodgy buyer who was using his "wifes" bank account - the account name matched a woman. I demanded his wifes phone number, and proceeded to ring her.
"Hello, my name is John Doe, and I'm calling in relation to a payment that has just been made by you."
"WHAT? A PAYMENT? WHERE? WHAT FOR?"
"We received a payment from your husband claiming he had permission from you to use his bank account."
"Oh yes, he does have permission..."
I still took his ID and everything else, and in the end released the bitcoins. No chargeback ensued. Some people just dig themselves a hole - and it's at your discretion whether you buy into it.

Hypothetically, you could buy an Antminer S7 or any other high-end miner and you would hit your ROI mark over the course of months/years considering Electricity is free. However, that ROI time is based on today's difficulty.
As the block halving approaches, large corporations will be pumping out mining power in bulk (such as Bitmain) as evidenced by the rising of difficulty over the past 2-months. These rises mean that your little miner is going to take longer and longer to ROI.
In realistic terms, yes you will profit. It may take 6-months, it may take 2-years, but I imagine you would eventually hit profit with an S7 or equivalent miner. 
Also, make sure you have express permission to use your work places electricity. Leaving an S7 running for months could foot up thousands in electric bills - which puts you in an extremely difficult place when it comes to theft of services, and possibly fraud. As the bill gets bigger and bigger, you could be looking at a $5K electricity bill after a year goes by - which is a large amount to be charged with. A prison sentence would be a possibility (at least in the UK), not to mention destroying your career.

Lol, you have no idea. I'm sorry, but if I had three kids, a mortgage to pay, a car to pay, and everything else - I definitely wouldn't use Bitcoin unless there was absolutely no chance of my funds being stolen/lost/hacked; neither would my parents, or my sister, or anybody I know at work.
You're stuck in a delusion :)

Deflation typically occurs in and after periods of economic crisis. When an economy experiences a severe recession or a depression, economic output slows as demand for consumption and investment drop. This leads to an overall decline in asset prices as producers are forced to liquidate inventories that people no longer want to buy. Consumers and investors alike begin holding on to liquid money reserves to cushion against further financial loss. As more money is saved, less money is spent, further decreasing aggregate demand.
At this point, people's expectations about future inflation are lowered, and they begin to hoard money. Why would you spend a dollar today when the expectation is that it could buy effectively more stuff tomorrow? And why spend tomorrow when things may be even cheaper in a week's time?

Yup. When the auction date was announced, the bitcoins to be auctioned tomorrow were worth $10m. At today's rate, they are worth $20m.
Quite a jump!

I think as long as she has realistic expectations in terms of probably nobody buying her book - then it's all OK. Bitcoin is such a small player right now, that anything mainstream, like a cook-book, just won't sell at all with Bitcoin as the sole payment processor.
I'd hate to see her dreams crushed because she doesn't sell a single copy of her book - and you're part of that. You've pushed Bitcoin so hard that she's almost been forced to accept it as a sole payment source. In reality, she has plenty of options. Google Wallet, Amazon Payments, 2checkout... Skrill.. Neteller.. Bank Transfer.. Clickbank.. List goes ON and ON and ON.
By pushing her to accept Bitcoin as a sole currency, you are going to severely damage her expectations of success. 
Edit: You said, "I have learned that people who don't particularly care about BItcoin are convinced the easiest when all the other services fail them".
Nobody has failed her. She went against PayPal's operating agreement, and got her account closed. If she rings PayPal and explains the situation, they will gladly allow her to make another account providing she doesn't owe them any money yet. She hasn't even looked at the other 5 payment providers I've listed above, not to mention the other 50 you can find on Google.

Change it to 3 then. If we experience volatility in block finding, 6 blocks could easily take 2-3 hours to be found. Too long for a bitcoin transaction to happen.

I've been looking at this harder.
The guy has the following on the front of his shirt: "science not race not fame not class made me into".
On the back it says, "woe onto those who spit on the fear generation the wind'll blow it back.". 
The second line refers to some kind of anti-globalization trend. There seems to be a guy who spoke these words in relation to centralization, and 9/11 - although I haven't looked into exactly what they refer to.
I'm positive it refers to Bitcoin, I'm just not sure how or where.

I've never had a CPU fry on me, but I'd like to assume that the technically minded that some what reliable CPU's - i5/i7 (current gen).

Agreed, great way to fry your CPU, while mining 0.0000001 per day, yet paying $3 a day in electricity.

For the hardcore info: 
TLDR: OneCoin is a centralized currency. The company controls the price - not the users. Users pay into the system, and those payments are paid out to previous investors. 
The system is fuelled by customer deposits. If no new customers were to join from now, the system would collapse and nobody would receive further payouts - that is a Ponzi scheme.
OneCoin pays out more money than they take it - that is how Ponzi's work.

The price will always retrace. When we go up $20 in one day, traders are selling to maximize their profits. At some point, a "dump" happens from the traders/holders, and the market goes back down.
It's what happens AFTER the drop that's important. If the market soaks and absorbs the drop, and continues back upwards, then it's a sign of a bullish market. If the trend continues down for more than 3-days, you're looking at entering a bearish market again.
I'm happy with the fact that the market is soaking the drops quite well, and remaining quite stable - if not constantly going up slightly.

The Chinese will inevitably make a public announcement that Bitcoin has been legalized. If that happens, we could see a massively bullish rally like we did with the States - especially considering China is a much more prominent adopter at this stage.
Bitcoin counters all of China's problems - mostly their capital currency controls. It's an exciting time right now, backed by momentum of Gemini + Bitcoin Sale + Block Halving.
How can you be bearish right now??

For the record, you'll probably earn little to nothing with a piece of hardware under $100. Why not launch a Group Buy, and buy a AntMiner S7 Batch 3 for $1500 - then split the profit 1/15 each.

The one benefit to Ponzi schemes is that those who get in first, make the most. With that said, I get the feeling that this will eventually destroy Bitcoin's reputation once mainstream media picks up the collapse.

In its current state, I imagine such affairs would be handled with violence - not by two civil men, sitting at a PC, looking over the blockchain.
When the countries you mentioned become more built up, and develop a legal infrastructure with no corruption, then things like this will become a thing of the past.

This is exactly the reason why we are years away from consumer adoption. When an innocent man/woman can lose 50 bitcoins and have no hope of recovering them, there is absolutely no way that everyday Joe's will adopt BTC as a currency.
This is actually the one benefit of the banking system. And may I add, the only benefit.
I remain positive that we will somehow develop a system whereby Consumers can adopt Bitcoin without fear of their monthly salary being hacked, stolen or lost.
To the moon chaps!

Be careful guys. It's clearly a scam - nobody can offer 10% above the market price and expect to turn a profit. The site is built by a 5-year old, and grammar/spellings are off all over the place.

Can probably be attributed to mainstream media if they pick it up. It'd be a pretty big headline. "Today, over $10 million worth of bitcoins were sold to an institutional investor for $8.5 million - proving that there is still some value in the somewhat relatively new currency.."
Or so the story goes...
All depends if MSM pick it up.

There's nothing wrong with using the same address. People say to use different addresses because it can provide better anonymity. I use one address for gambling - so I can track my profit/loss and have used the same one for 2-months, making over 500 transactions to/from the address.
If you've got nothing to hide, then don't worry.

I think I got downvoted because a lot of people are under the assumption that Bitcoin is ready for mainstream adoption, and refuse to believe anything different
People need to realise that we're in the 1990's of the Internet. We need to find ways to allow consumers to easily use Bitcoin, without fear of losing their wealth - that they rely on to purchase food etc.

You're a man of high risk. Expect a letter from Google's lawyers regarding the use of name, and ESPECIALLY the logo. You're effectively trying to deceive visitors into thinking that Bloockgle is related to Google - something that can lead to very serious repercussions.
I'm being so blunt because I'm sure you meant no harm - but pull out and change the logo/domain name ASAP or you could face a law suit on your hands.

I definitely agree with this. If you are forced to accept something to pay off a debt, then that "something" is the currency. 
If I owe £10k to a credit card company, and I offer to pay them in Bitcoin, and they refuse, Bitcoin is not considered a currency. Likewise, if I offered the credit card company either:  
a) Cash  
b) A check  
c) A bank transfer  
d) A debit card payment
Then they will accept, because it gives them access to our recognised currency (the pound). They have to. Now, some rules apply such as they will only accept certain amounts via certain channels (I'm sure they wouldn't take £500k in cash). 
There's a popular thing going around in the UK at the moment. People who are being fined by schools for taking their children on holiday are choosing to pay their fines in 1p coins. The fines are like £60, and these guys are just rolling in with 6,000 £0.01 coins. The schools have to accept it.
