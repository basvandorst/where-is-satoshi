"While this mean that your node can be attacked at all time, you are still the only one in controle of the private key."
But again, the node has the ability to sign transactions on your behalf, which requires your private key. So if the node is attacked, your private key is, in effect, compromised, no?

I didn't mean to suggest that anybody literally has the private key. Just that the network does need to have access to it, so that it can sign the HTLC transaction. I'll add the work "indirect" so it's clearer.

Publishing the preimage is an unrelated issue to this post - the "hot wallet" hack involves accessing a user's private keys to publish the fund's latest transaction.
It's not clear to me how that could be "mitigated by monitoring the blockchain." If somebody broadcasts your transaction, to anybody monitoring the blockchain, it'll look just as valid as if you yourself broadcast it, no?

Agreed - that's definitely an obstacle to adoption. That said, there's nothing in principle stopping two parties from opening a channel where the initial funding is unsymmetrical; in some sense it's "riskier" for the party with more BTC, but as long as they have reliable liveness and such, they're safe.

Much appreciated!

Precisely my goal, great to hear!

There's no one official release called "LN 2.0", that's just a general term I'm using to refer to "a bunch of new stuff people are working on," which are in various different stages of development (some already live in a small capacity, some purely theoretical still, etc)
TLDR: 
\- New strategies for keeping liquidity balanced/ flexibility in path finding (net result: won't need to open new channels as often) 
\- Different state channel types with (arguably) better security trade-offs 
\- Light client LN nodes, 
\- More advanced routing architecture  
\- Looser requirements for liveness.

Umm, does this have to do with the piece? Or... just a thought you felt like sharing?

To clarify some other answers here, merkling is really accomplishing multiple things at once. First off, we want some representation of all of the transactions in a block in the form of a single hash; merkelizing the transactions into a single root is how this is done.
Now, there are plenty of other ways to hash transaction data \(like say, just concatenating all of them and sha\-256 hashing them all at once\). What's nice about using merkle trees is that now, light clients can verify payments by retrieving the merkle path of a transaction from a full node \(instead of asking for the full block, say\).

Also, there is risk here of collusion b/t the watchtower and one's channel counter-party; counter-party could share the txid directly with the watchtower without broadcasting the txn. Minor risk, but worth thinking about.

Brilliant. One question - for step 4, how do we enforce "send a portion of the stolen coins to himself." What's stopping him from sending himself all of the coins?
