My apologies, I was speaking more along the lines of large purchases that would require verification (which I thought took age into account).

Isn’t it only $20 for like 500 checks though? I like the initiative but before paying REALLLY look over what ever paper work he drafts up.

Nice try Bloomberg, you are just trying to do away with any lingo in regards to Bitcoin in order to prevent future media blunders!
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:52:12
Ah perfect, it is a great currency to stash and forget about it! I remember on my last heist half the team was debating between crypto and blow, at that point I took my cut and invested haphazardly.  Thug life and all.

Heh just got to let the rest of the world do the work, felt like that South Korean mall had a larger affect than anything recent.

I thought the minimum age to buy Bitcoin was 18, how did you all complete a purchase at all?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:46:48
Not sure how that works out, but I know for example in Japan you need a Japanese bank account to buy/sell/withdraw from their exchanges.  I suppose if you had a bank account in both countries you could make it work!

Tends to go up at night, seeing how it is day on the other side of the world.

You aren’t trusting anything, you are gambling (poorly I might add).  Do some more research if you have 75% of your money in an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:00:51
A majority of the market is in Korea and Japan, which is 13 hours ahead give or take.  Use that as you will!  Joys of a 24/7 365 marketers mean it is always fresh.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:32:53
I would say because there is an actual use for Bitcoin in their daily lives compared to most other places.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:25:54
Just remember, these are the kind of people all the new redditors associate this sub with “hey I was told to invest, haha, how do I start fellow sheeple? Guide me! PS I want to start a Bitrig for mining”
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:58:20
This is generally how people help each other here, you can trust them with that information at the least.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:04:43
I would say it would be a positive situation, showing that not just any crypto currency is the silver bullet to world economics.  Also every time a currency declines or fails is a win for Bitcoin in the long run!

Ah my apologies, was a long day!  I was trying to make a point on how a majority of the US population will believe this video was extremely informative; at the same time I was rambling about how a majority of people turn to others for financial advice even in regards to say BitCoin despite being against the status quo.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:17:18
I know in Japan all it takes is $10 and there are no fees, but I guess Japan and China is apples to oranges!

Can purchase through Breadwallet with a linked bank account, no credit cards though.

Been trying to catch my dad up on Bitcoin and what it means for the future, but he is still hesitant.  However, he was talking about the recent tax plan by the Trump administration and was incredibly angry about how the rich gets richer.  I used this as a learning discussion about how much money is being printed and how only a handful are benefitting.  Long winded, just my most recent experience!
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:09:58
Get a refund and never invest again? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:09
Ya just made an instant purchase, is your bank account at $0 or are your cards maxed out?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:43:58
Ah meant it will be one of those two times, sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:47:30
You asked a question no one is knowledgeable about and some one asked a question others are knowledgeable about...yes...let’s reward your stupidity.

Wall Street, didn’t read but it was first google link...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:35:15
2 PM PST or after the Big Bang episode.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:54:53
Again, google :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:49:36
There are no tips except put in only what you can afford to lose, this is glorified gambling at the moment seeing how people are in it to make a quick buck rather than the long term goals.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:43:20
I like BlockFolio, you can add all of your transactions to monitor. It was a little buggy the past few days due to the high number of sales however.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:48:01
Haha very true, expecting to see some high quality references /s
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:35
But the price is just right!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:48:48
December 12th is CME day!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:09:31
There is more than one exchange....
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:44
Isn’t CoinMama based out of Israel? Or was it Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:20:54
Check the Community Info, lots of wonderful info to guide you through a majority of the process!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:27:03
How do you pay for rent and groceries, converting it to fiat on a weekly or daily basis?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:56
Last I saw was the 12th, I thought I heard the 11th was an error and the 10th was correct as well....guess the week will be shaky!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:47:09
Or you know...because they have actual vendors who accept Bitcoin as payment? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:47:48
Just flush your life please.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:49:38
You don’t think the 11th or 12th after the CME?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:12
Read the side bar
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:43:37
Ya think it is tonight
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:27:20
Seeing how Mr. Musk freely states when, where, and how he wants to help the greater good even if it shakes up the political spectrum I feel like his statement earlier this week claiming he isn’t Satoshi is worth believing.
