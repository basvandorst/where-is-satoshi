I used to be a developer on Google play. My most successful app was Titan (maybe some of you still use it) and was removed without notice cutting my main source of income.

Thank you kind sir! Your generosity just made my day!
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:16:20
Tip me!

Thank you! :)

Hi! I'm new to bitcoin, and I have just created an account just to say this. I want a chance to discover thi currency!

I completely agree with you.

21 BTC? This is actually a pretty big amount of money! How did you get it?
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:42:19
Bitcoins coupon! If someone buys something with fiat you give the customer a paper wallet with a fixed amount of bitcoin and you briefly explain what it is. It's a great opportunity to get people into bitccoin, and if you succeed in getting their attention they'll sure come back to spend more!

As easy as buy any other product online! The only difference is that the exchange I used required the user to recharge a specific prepaid card. The prepaid was from the same bank as my main bank account so the process was straightforward. I have also paid a whole 5% more than the price listed on Kraken.

Thank you! :)

Looks pretty different to me. With flyers you are trying to get new customers, with a coupon like this you are offering a recurring customer a service!

Right now I'm using GreenAddress but I'm thinking to move to a paper wallet.

Wow! I probably should visit Australia... I probably need to overcome my fear of big spiders first! ;)
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:30:08
Thank you for your patience! :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:10:23
Do you follow the BTC value to decide to buy? What are you planning to do with it? What kind of wallet do you use?
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:06:16
I have been lurking for two months now! I have created an account just for this sub. :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:38:14
Still scary!

The fact is that most people don't know/don't use Bitcoins yet. A few of them just discovered his existence with this article. It's amazing how fast and how bad the public opinion reacts to such news. If ISIS was using any other fiat currency, gold or even trading socks no one would be bothered. But now someone, somewhere has BTC=ISIS in his mind. That is indeed a shame.

Thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:46:08
Nice news! Thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:11:10
Ahahahaha! Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:00:58
This is a shame... :( I got into bitcoins too late!
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:10:04
Selling is a great idea! Can you suggest me some service/site/subreddit?
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:38:19
Thank you!

Why is anyone tipping this guy? I'm I missing something? Am I jealous? What I'm doing with my life?
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:11:20
The question is at this point, why should I invest in it!
