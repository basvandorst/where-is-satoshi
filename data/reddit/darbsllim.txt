Does anyone else feel extremely angry and upset by this, as of its an attack on "one of us"?

Proof that the leaked doc was legit:

saw it after I made this post - nanashi__ is fake though, he's the guy who wanted 100 BTC
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:00:51
I did a search in tineye and it came up negative... but thats true

The rumored mtgox address is [likely related to bitstamp]( not mtgox.

Nanashi__ 100 BTC Gox Data Leak Ransom ... its fake. He just googles your name to "prove" the data sample.
I contacted the hacker yesterday, asked for the date of the leak. He replied about an hour ago and said:


 


So I gave him my username at gox and asked for the last balance, he replied with:


I gave him the email of the account (which was my Chinese partner) and he replied back with my Canadian game company's corporate address.
He just googled my name.
Same thing happened to one of the developers of the [GoxCoin Project]( ... so both of us can confirm this is not a real db dump, rest assured he most likely does not have your passport and personal data.

[A new chat log has surfaced]( that allegedly shows someone talking to Mark K on IRC, he even sends him a picture of his cute kitty.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:34:52
Even though I participated in this burn, it was a conflict of my internal interest to do whatever I can to acquire bitcoin.

I've found corroborating evidence that this irc chat actually happened. I initially thought this IRC chat was suspect, especially with the picture of the cat on the keyboard...it wouldn't be hard to fake an IRC chat...but it's more difficult to fake Mark Karpeles's keyboard.
I was watching CBC news and I saw what looked like the exact same keyboard with some stock footage of Mark Karpeles at mtgox headquarters.
The replay of the segment is up here:
Here's the screenshot of Mark K's desk at mtgox from this CBC segment. 
And here's the kitty cat pic for reference:
Here's an old video of Mark K's cat on youtube:
Either the irc chat was faked and someone did extensive research and prepared the correct prop keyboard and correct prop cat, or that pic really is Mark Karpeles's keyboard and cat.
At this point, I'm thinking that irc chat actually happened.

Here is an argument from a friend against the linked bitcoin address being the rumored mtgox cold wallet:
There are too many assumptions and variables in the equation to try anything like that... 
^ that 'cold storage' wallet address, the balance over time
this address was never very 'cold', this looks more like a hot wallet - here is just-dice's cold storage, for comparison:

I'm asking which companies have a team of bitcoin developers on staff, who are the main ones.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:30:09
if you want to do bitcoin gambling, that's the whole point of Bitcoin Cash. Funded in part by Calvin Ayre of of bodog poker. I'm not a bash fan, but if you want to do gambling on a blockchain, it's an option.

Hey Luke - well, I use a user account that doesn't have admin status, not sure if that has anything to do with it.
I ran the install program as administrator, it installed, started downloading the blockchain, but didn't finish. It got to about 1 year left.
I restarted the computer, when it booted back up, bitcoin program was not in the start menu, and I had to go to c:/Program Files/Bitcoin and try to run it from there.
When it opened, it said no block source and it had to start downloading it all over again.
This has happened on 2 computers where I don't have the account setup as an admin for security purposes.

As much as I detest Craig Wright pretending to be Satoshi, this also makes me skeptical.

Adam Back and others were referenced in the whitepaper, Nick Szabo and Hal Finney were there in the early days. There were plenty of other cypherpunks involved who didn't try to claim to be satoshi, and who don't seem to be rude douches.

Well that depends - I think they meant to say "we are a non-profit" as in a non profit organization. Unless they really meant "we are non-profit" as in we don't want to make any revenue...

I only have 1 wallet.dat file and it's in the roaming folder.
Does 0.11.1 put the wallet.dat in the roaming folder also?

I can't immediately see a need for this. Can you give me a use case? What would I want to use this for? What problems does this solve?

I think it installed to a different directory ... how do I properly import the wallet.dat from the old 0.8.5 bitcoin core folder to the new 0.11.1 folder?
Can I just drag and drop?
The only file menu option is Open URI and I have no idea what that is, thats new.

I have it on a usb key but it's about a year old. Does that matter?
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:53:19
I think the upgrade process should change ... not everyone who uses bitcoin core is a programmer. It should be a bit more user friendly.
When upgrading it should walk you through protecting the wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:21:16
you guys sure like to downvote. I think this is a valuable post, people could lose their BTC if they don't do the upgrade properly.

I did email him and he said:
"Ok, that was a different pool. It closed down and all the coins were
sent to the address registered with the account. The merge mining pool
started a few months later."
Only problem is wheres the 3500 coins because I never registered an address with the pool :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:30:38
I had about 35 bitcoins stolen from mybitcoin and I lost some coins from tradehill, and about 3500 namecoins from bitparking ... so I'm no stranger to losing coins, thats why I gave up in 2011 ;)
Glad I kept a few though.
