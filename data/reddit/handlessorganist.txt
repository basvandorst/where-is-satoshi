A crash in the market would not cause the Bitcoin ETF to also crash, it would actually cause the ETF to explode to the upside.  The "market" crashing would signal that stocks are temporarily not a safe place to get a good return or store your money.  People would rethink where to put their money and would retreat to safe havens, cash, gold or bitcoin.  The bitcoin ETF will have a tethered price relationship to bitcoin and the only ties it has to the stock market is that you can now purchase bitcoin exposure as a "stock" with your Etrade or 401k money.  
When the market has small dips or crashes now some etfs will soar, like the ETFs that have an inverse relationship to certain sectors.  Basically, when the "market crashes" many stocks and etfs do the opposite and shoot up.  The Bitcoin ETF would be one of those

The long term trend of BTC is up.  You can try to jump in and out to play the swings or just hodl and ride it.  Eventually you'll get burned trying to play the swings, so with BTC I think the turtle hodlers is a good place to be over the spazzy hares

I don't think it's likely, PBOCs impact is diminished with the way they've handcuffed the Chinese exchanges right now

A few hundred, like $1200 worth?  Ouch.  It's looking like Segwit will enact on the LTC network in about two months time, I like that

Maybe that's happening now

5 hrs, no emails to support.  Drivers license and bank statement is what I used for verification

Unless the ETF gets denied and price comes down, they might not need to panic sell when withdrawals resume

Nice analogies

Those are all very good points, I agree that the action right now suggests accumulation.  I've got some good investing experience in technical and fundamental analysis, but more than anything it's clear that the dips are getting bought up amid a time of trading near all time highs and supposed bad news on the horizon.  The pricing action looks like more people are buying than being cautious.  
On another note we haven't heard from Kim Dotcom in awhile, last I remember his MU2 was supposed to show screenshots in Feb.  maybe that'll come soon and provide even more interest in BTC

The Alts have had unreasonable gains, traders are selling the alts for bitcoin to lock in their gains and that increases demand for btc.  As long as you can only buy alts with bitcoin this relationship will always exist
