Christmas time, people are HODLing, spending during the holidays.

Depending on which sub-Reddit your on, not bad.  Lots of female friendly subs, though if you do programming and like technology your *not as welcomed* as your male counterparts.

Yep, apparently some BTC millionaires plugged them since that gave them a way to pay without a FIAT transfer.

Working in tech, there is a long hours aspect as well.  I know a female project manager who does 40-45 hours a week, which she gets yelled at for not managing a project all hours.
Most women view there roles as secondary to life.  I know some of my male devs stay and work while my female co devs go home deliverable or not.
It's a big problem with working in tech in general...

Sell or buy things, depends on what your shopping for.

I'm not paranoid maybe crazy... but not paranoid. ��

Great tool if not for taxes it helps show your ups/downs over a period of time with your BTC HODLing! :)

You mean like a 4chan user? ��

Grabbing some water and taking a hot shower, relax boys it's the holidays... investments settle during this time and people buy gifts.

Oh noo my HODL is broken... ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:54:14
Heck yeah, and side note I'm not a fan of those women in tech groups...  It never seems like women in those like tech... They just work in it.

Woman HODL'er here. Close to my 1BTC! :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:59:00
It's not that bad, I have a boy toy for that stuff.  He takes care of the household stuff while I think sexy empty thoughts while on GDAX as BTC goes up. ��

I have no idea... I write code for a living, and even there, it's like this bubble exists at the water cooler and some meetings where some of the older C-level executive men give you the occasional odd look like you don't belong here... 
On Reddit it's less obvious but the feeling is still there like they feel the need to challenge you, on well everything.

Yeah only Remax allows you to buy houses with Bitcoin.

**THIS!**  Pay off all debts except the mortgage and car loan.  Your mortgage plus the cars should be under 30% of your take home pay.  
Once your there, put 10% in savings (Fiat) and 5-10% in investments. The advantage of buying crypto like bitcoin is that you can still take it out if you need it.

Current and historical. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:03:44
Darn right girl!  Show that manling who makes money!  ������
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:36:30
Don't forget you can also buy stuff, one good way of cashing out is to just buy something for the current bitcoin value.
