Thanks to the great work of MAPS and their supporters, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is almost ready for Phase 3 trials. 
I think Phase 3 trials for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is the most promising path to use of psychedelics for healing; including psilocybin and ketamine for depression (which have also been very promising)!
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:25:21
&lt;3, this warmed my heart :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:54:41
In 2011 you were probably using Bitcoin-Qt.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:59:57
Me too! I remember 50btc.com and Deepbit. I think I'm owed a balance from both of those pools, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:05:43
Not just USA based charities, we will be making donations to many international charities in the weeks to come.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:16:31
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:48:27
Thanks! Life extension is indeed one area that Pineapple Fund intends to support further :)

PF isn't asking for donations; this is about a matched grant to an existing charity, for a significant project. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:00:13
In other news, we also made a bunch of other donations today!
* $1 million to The Focus Foundation, a charity assisting families and children, and funding research for chromosome disorders (e.g. XXY, XXX).
* $250k to Erowid.org, a life-saving factual resource. Erowid acts as an information hub for a global network of experts who are not able to be openly public about their factual, scientific, and personal views.
* $250k to the Software Freedom Conservancy, home of critical open source infrastructure projects like Git, Homebrew, Selenium and more.
* $250k to the Neural Archives Foundation, an Australian non-profit preserving neural (brain) tissue as an historical archive, stored in cryogenic tissue banking facilities.
* $250k to OpenStreetMap, because geographic data for our world should be freely available, without restrictions.
* $100k to Hearts and Homes for Refugees a humanitarian group supporting refugees including those prosecuted for their religious beliefs.

Fun fact: The coinbase of block 0 isn't spendable due to a coding oversight (or maybe it was intentional?)

Exactly. MDMA isn't adulterated and uncontrolled 'ectasy' or 'molly', and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is a comprehensive psychotherapy package involving 12 sessions of therapy, 3 doses of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and other preparatory and follow on sessions.
It is a highly structured and personalized approach that uses MDMA as an effective multiplier for therapy, allowing patients to explore the depths of their experiences and emotions in a way only possible with an empathogen. 
One of the participants in the Phase 2 trials described it as such:


@_date: 2018-01-31 09:57:44
That's definitely a factor we consider! Pineapple Fund generally does not donate more than 50% of an organization's annual revenue.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:10:30
I communicated this to MAPS and I believe this is done automatically by Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:02:18
This made me laugh so hard :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:17:51
PF is agnostic on BTC/BCH/&lt;insert crypto&gt;, that post was made after frustration when our transactions weren't confirming for days.
Cryptocurrency specific donations aren't in the scope of the Pineapple Fund, and that's for any cryptocurrency.
I do find the civil war of the two communities pretty disheartening. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:44:47
I appreciate the scepticism, this is bitcoin after all, don't believe it until you see 6 confirmations :)
Hopefully you'll like the announcement!
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:54:07
PF donated $5 mil to GiveDirectly already :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:24:25
Thanks for the reco!
I've shortlisted their application, and I'll be in touch with them soon.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:36:22
I think this is a great area that you are working on!
Looking at your about page, it seems that OLM is about taking close up, geotagged images of each litter item, and then it is reviewed by admins and members.
This seems like a lot of overhead; moreso than picking up litter? In addition, wouldn't a trained computer vision project /ML model be orders of magnitudes more efficient at collecting AND verifying this data?
In addition, have you done any impact assessments? For example, is the identification of litter, the bottleneck of reducing plastic pollution?
Looking forward to your response! :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:51:13
No, all donations to MAPS will be eligible for the match! MAPS will be sending us the aggregated figures, and we'll be making the matched donation weekly.

I'm a bitcoin early adopter and I'm donating most of my cryptocurrency (~5050 BTC) to charitable causes! Check out pineapplefund.org :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:50:11
Thanks! Life extension is indeed one cause that PF intends to support further :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:12:05
We haven't! We still have a lot to go through, and a lot who we have shortlisted but not emailed yet.
There's no need to follow up though, we'll get to you, but sorry for the delay! There's been so many applications, and PF is not a full time project.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:58:56
Thank you! A lot of them have actually been community suggestions :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:21:46
I think the vast majority of ICOs are deceptive at best, and scams at worst.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:51:02
We encourage people to donate directly to charities, and do not solicit donations to the Pineapple Fund.
You shouldn't donate to us, and while **I** like living a low profile life, marketing helps increase awareness of the Pineapple Fund and crypto charitable giving in general.
For example, PF has inspired another $1 million bitcoin donation to MAPS, not us.
Your hostility is pretty surprising, and while I don't like to speculate, your commenting history suggests it is political.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:19:47
Hi Glenn,
Thank you so much for your message. Realistically, do you know what the odds of a software, hardware, or universe failure affecting a transaction? Has such an event ever happened in bitcoin?
Currently, we craft raw transactions in a dedicated offline environment, and then verify the raw transaction before broadcasting onto an online computer. 
I'm definitely interested in your advice!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:22:43
I am pursuing my own ambitions in life so I can only offer financial support now, but if you personally know any causes or would even like to open a 'pineapple animal shelter', get in touch!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:36:38
Absolutely! Will donate $50k to [The OpenBSD Foundation](
Their BitPay takes $10k a day, so [here's the first $10k](
Thanks for the idea!
p.s. I would like to fund a diverse range of charitable endeavours, not just what we interact with the most in the tech / bitcoin bubble. So don't think The Pineapple Fund is mainly about tech! Feel free to apply for non-tech causes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:20:58
Hi, Pineapple Fund here! We will be donating $1 million to New Story charity shortly :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:43:48
Yes, I noticed a number of fishy things with that supposed foundation and declined to donate. They got more and more pushy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:20:39
It is a relatively round number, some of the 5057 BTC came from selling bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:06:57
Pineapple Fund is donating a million to the EFF :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:01:34
We will. This is one of our focus areas.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:58:57
Yes, absolutely. This is one of our focus areas.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:55:29
We're in touch with the MIT DCI!
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:39:58
Thank you Glenn for your detailed message, advice, and research! We are going to be implementing these recommendations and making sure to check not just the addresses but also the amounts. 
We do have a small advantage in that we send to generally known addresses (BitPay, Coinbase, etc), so that in the astronomical event of something still slipping past, we feel we have a good chance of recovery. Of course, fees are a more dubious story, but here's hoping that this unlikely circumstance never happens :)
Again, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:30:13
Pineapple Fund is not a charity in itself.
And the domain has WhoisGuard, which comes included with Namecheap.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:19:35
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:40:56
Thank you for the positivity! &lt;3 
Hope you have a great festive season :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:01:25
Unrelated, but I wish the them the best.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:06:34
How can we seize the means of production? :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:40:41
I'm sorry to hear about your fiance. I agree with you 100%, and The Pineapple Fund will predominately focus on things outside the bitcoin sphere.
I would like to set up a multi million dollar fund with one focus being medical **research**. Working on that :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:29
All from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:55:12
We are happy to contribute some money towards the bitcoin ecosystem, however as many people have pointed out in this thread, it doesn't seem like money is holding the Lightning Project back, and I believe there are better places to contribute :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:30
Yes, I would love to make a very substantial contribution to the SENS Foundation. Will be reaching out to them :)
Thanks for your recommendation!
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:11:03
We're already donated $1 million to MAPS to their bitcoin address :) Check our website!
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:39:19
Quick update!
Donated another $80k to the EFF
Donated $1 million to MAPS
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:12:31
That's amazing! Definitely will keep my eye out for TalkLife.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:36:57
I like pineapple person! I mean, it'd be great to go down in history as an avid lover of pineapple that donated a bunch of bitcoins to charity :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:52:20
Thanks &lt;3
I chose the Internet Archive as it is a library that becomes more and more valuable everyday. They don't just have the wayback machine, but they also have numerous archiving efforts for books, even abandoned games, and sites / communities that were shut down (thanks Archive Team!).
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:47:03
You're not alone. We had a similar transaction, and had to make a CPFP transaction with $1100 in fees to get it confirmed. 
I shared an update about the Pineapple Fund and how bitcoin's scalability wall is impacting us.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:12:18
Appreciate your message. We don't donate to those organizations. :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:57:10
Noted! We will reach out to them. The SENS Foundation sounds like a charity that I would like to make a very substantial donation to, so I will reach out.
If you know a point of contact, feel free to make an introduction :) Email is on the website.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:17:59
Sounds amazing! I've sent you a chat message :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:00:28
We will be in touch, might be a few days, but I promise you we'll be in touch :)

Pineapple Fund's donation to MAPS has inspired another $1 million donation from another awesome person/entity, for one :)

Real answer: I really like pineapple, and the dot org wasn't taken.
Retrospective metaphor: You know how pineapple is super delicious, but when you eat too much pineapple, your mouth and tongue gets tender? The solution is to share the pineapple with other people and spread the deliciousness ;D
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:24:19
Absolutely :)

Hey I recognize you from your dota and csgo update posts! \o/
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:29:46
Thank you I'm really happy with the impact I was able to make with the Pineapple Fund, and it's shaped what I want to do in my life. I don't know if I'll be able to make a bigger impact one day, but I sure hope I will :)
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:33:01
Hey, I'm still here and lurking the bitcoin community as usual :)
I've tried to read every email and PM that was sent to me back in the Pineapple Fund days. You can still contact me by replying, PMing, or emailing me (contact at pineapplefund dot org)
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:43:36
Sold it for BTC and they were added to the PF proceeds.
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:40:04
You do raise a good point! I was pretty new to philanthropy, and I've learned a lot with the Pineapple Fund. I was also certain we were in a bubble, so I wanted to liquidate the coins as soon as possible, and for tax reasons donations needed to be made in-kind (in bitcoin).
If crypto goes to Mars, then the next Pineapple Fund will look different. And I hope a lot of people will be joining me :)
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:43:00

It doesn't work like that. The IRS, for example, has caps on the amount of charitable deductions you may claim per year.

This isn't just about the gender gap. It's far more than that.
Computer science used to be a field dominated by women a few decades ago, until a gradual push of gendered marketing and casual sexism pushed them out. [1]
In technology in particular, the industry is biased against women, and there is significant empirical evidence *and* personal evidence I know of. From subtle discrimination like completely identical resumes being rejected more if they had a female name [2], to less family friendly working environments typical of tech companies and startups [3], to vile cultures of "brogrammers" resembling frat societies that I personally know have made alienated and/or harassed women [4], to outright sexual assault and predatory behavior by VCs in the power chain [5], there is a huge amount of injustice in this field that is sadly biased against women and minorities. 
I'm proud to be supporting charities like SoGal Foundation and Women Who Tech. This is absolutely real problem, and a serious problem. Software is building the future of our world, and we need to make sure the world we build is an inclusive one. If you have not heard personal stories from people who you work with, it's not because it doesn't exist. It's because they don't feel comfortable telling you.

I really have no idea where this is coming from.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:07:52
With a few exceptions, Pineapple Fund does not contribute more than 50% of an organization's annual funding; to ensure our donations are sustainable and have minimal inefficiencies as organizations scale up :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:40:24
I remember a quote from Satoshi: bitcoin will either be worth almost nothing or a lot of money. It's unlikely for it to be in-between.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:27:08
I almost forgot, PF is matching $1 million to the [Internet Archive]( We'd like to think of the internet as a lasting resource, but without the Internet Archive, link rot and shifting format compatibility means collective knowledge and internet culture will slowly disappear. Archive.org is the digital library of our generation, storing everything from web pages to [Atari games]( Shoutout to [Archive Team]( as well! 
Buterin even made an amazing donation of 100 ETH!
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:23:13
Yes, would love a source on this. Pineapple Fund is not affiliated.
