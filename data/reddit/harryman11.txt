What people don't see though is the bullshit that is "using legal means to reduce your tax burden" when I applied to companies. Why do you think our tax code is 10s of thousands of pages long its because all of these big companies can lobby to get loop holes passed so they can use the bullshit excuse of doing everything legal to reduce their tax burden. They fail to mention the millions they spend millions to pass legislation that will reduce what they legally are required to pay saving them billions. While average Joe doesn't have the same capability to just lobby for tax breaks and loopholes.

I think there was an old saying that if you don't read the news you are uniformed, but if you read the news than you are misinformed. Just because reddit is under the guise of being edited by the crowd doesn't mean that it is actually true. For as much as it would cost to seed stories and create sock accounts to manipulate perceived opinion vs how much a large investor stands to save if the price tumbles a few hundred dollars its a no brainer investment. Remember for these large  institutional investors coming in they are smart and have a seeming lack of morals when it comes to making vast amounts of money. Manipulating opinion is not below them, they over throw third world governments to increase margins less than the 30% discount they are getting with all of this recent FUD. 
Since this last run up to 1000 I've been taking everything I hear on here with a bigger grain of salt than I used to.
tl;dr When money is involved assume everyone/everywhere is manipulating/being manipulated to get you to do things for their gain and most likely your loss. Do your own homework before making decisions.

I don't have the link for the interview but Elon Musk had said that while we are fixing these problems now we should have started 10 years ago because of the sheer amount of infrastructure we have to replace. 
If you noticed in the reveal he compared it to making automobiles in terms of scale. If you use that as a measuring stick for how long it takes to ramp up production look at this graph  It took China 22 years to build up the infrastructure from 1 million cars in 1992 to 20 million in 2014 we aren't even to the million mark in terms of large grid batteries. The first Gigafactory is only outputting 85GWH a year. To replace the batteries(assuming 10year lifespan) required to run the United States you would need 19 gigafactories just to sustain itself. There will need to be even more gigafactories to build out the initial capacity. 
The scales are so large they are hard to comprehend the timescales. It's our generation's space race. The problem is that people can't see that we are racing against the clock because its on such a long time scale its hard to impress any sort urgency about it. 
You think it is a solved problem which technically it is, we have to technology required to to solve it, the problem is scaling it up fast enough. The only thing that can help that now is by investment. Thats what I'm advocating that we focus our investments on renewable infrastructure even if you could get better returns elsewhere because without that underlying energy infrastructure the whole thing grinds to a halt. 
I know it was a bit off topic but the video said we had enough energy and I couldn't let it go because this is biggest issue of our time whether we know yet or not.
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:58:56
I think you misunderstand me, when I say "the world is a zero sum game" I'm referring to the energy landscape not voluntary trade or the abstract notion of "wealth". 
Obviously if both parties didn't benefit they wouldn't voluntarily agree to trade. However this perceived benefit received based on the information they have. When two parties have asymmetric information the one with least amount of information are coerced by their ignorance into taking on more risk while the more informed avoid those risk, there is a lot to it I would suggest Jaron Lanier's *Who Owns The Future* he does good job at explaining the information component of trade and what it means in the age of the internet and supercomputers. 
Wealth and money are just references to the actual resources. All the wealth in the world can't buy the energy you need if there physically isn't enough of it, its physics. That's why I'm advocating we invest in the only on which wealth can be built, energy. Since Saudi Arabia switched to the strategy of pumping as much oil out of the ground before it becomes worthless due to renewables and/or environmental concerns if they run out before we have sufficient renewable energy infrastructure to make up for that deficit it isn't going to be pretty.

Let's not fight ourselves, lets fix the underlying problem  There is less energy per capita and than there was and its only going to get worse as we run out/can't use fossil fuels.
If you want to rise up and take power what dwindling power remains go ahead it's not going to solve anything. If you want power, make it. Put a wind turbine on your house or some solar panels. Become energy neutral, grow garden and unplug from the consumerism which drives our collective nose to the grindstone then you can have your 10hr week. Energy underlies everything in our lives, you control your energy you control your life.
The rich &amp; powerful don't want a downgrade in their standard of living just as much as you or I(we're all human), they just had the means to protect that standard of living at the cost of ours because the world is a zero sum game. When the pie gets smaller and someone tries hold onto their entire slice something has to give, and it's the ones who don't have the power to hold on to their slice that end up giving. Energy is the tide that raises all boats. We have ability to build energy now with renewables, we just need to have the foresight to invest in it even when it doesn't make sense in the now, because that shortsightedness has allowed us to fall this far.

Well I'll agree we wouldn't be in this situation if there was a functioning unfettered energy market that actually reflects the costs.  We don't need to kill the state, it will become irrelevant if everyone starts producing their own energy. Money is just tokens that can be used to buy energy or spent energy(products) through money and control of the energy that underlies it is how the government holds its power. Take way control of the money and the energy what do they have to influence people. Violence? Soldiers and arms manufacturers need to get paid and consume energy to operate, war becomes unprofitable. 
Elon Musk realizes how far we still have to go see my other comment  That is why he is open sourcing everything because we are so far behind the 8 ball in terms of renewable production infrastructure. This isn't a political problem its an investment/time problem. Infrastructure investments take a long time to pay back, but there are plenty of other short term investments that look better if you assume business, an assumption that isn't founded in the reality of our energy production prospects.
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:35:23


Not if they hold control over the energy, currency is not value/wealth just the reference to it. Distributed currency and energy together is the only sure fire way to kill the state as we know it.

I don't get where you think I'm a statist. "All I'm advocating for is investment in our energy infrastructure everything will follow after that." At no point did I say the state should have anything to do with it. I'm trying to convince people to make that investment on their own accord. If you become energy independent there is much less power the state can hold over you, with bitcoin and renewables the state becomes irrelevant because those technologies are anti centralization. Please read the post instead of making false assumptions.

The thing is though having that automated tracking is only needed when they are trying to log hours. Hours that the company is ostensibly paying you to preform a set of tasks. I think that privacy isn't something people on the clock can expect much of.
The biggest problem is that in human systems/organizations this information gives those with it more power, this imbalance can lead to politics and corruption. If you look at time and task tracking and think what 10x automation would look like we can get the granularity and accuracy to the point where you can track the actual value of individual actions. You could have an apolitical and scalable organization, the only limit to its size would be how many people agree that the value calculation algorithm is fair.
I think we will all witness the birth of the human super organism, where we organize ourselves like flocks of birds, leaderless, fluid, and forkable.

An attacking mining group, which doesn't mean a real conspiracy of mining guilds since what would benefit one mining outfit would benefit all mining groups so they have a common goal of maximizing profit(see Capitalism). Now if you have a hefty % of mining power performing a sybil attack on the network by putting up a majority nodes that accept your version is relatively cheap. There isn't any way to prevent that from happening or even making it expensive to do so. The network has no way of knowing what an "honest" node looks like.
Herein lies the real issue the network has to reference itself to reach a consensus on what "honest" is, and if you are performing a sybil attack you are conveniently controlling a majority of the nodes required for reaching consensus. There isn't enough intelligence in consensus alone to decide if it is indeed the protocol you think the network should follow. There will always have to be some amount of trust in the network where the individual doesn't own an equal part of it. 
Even if you could more evenly distribute the infrastructure running the network you still have the possibility of political attack/failure. Whereby people choose to use a version of the protocol that while it will make it cheaper/more profitable to run the infrastructure but unintentionally cause a shift in the distribution of influence on the network opening it more changes that less evenly distribute the infrastructure. 
No one wants to pay for anything if there is a way to get it for "free"[Relavant John Oliver Clip]( Some core devs might want to sell you something for free(not maliciously) but because they haven't done a full cost accounting of what it really costs both in terms of systemic risk and in the distribution of power/influence in the network.

Okay let me try and explain this differently. 
You have address A you use this for most of you everyday purchases since you don't want to wait around all the time for transactions to confirm you want to use it as a green address. So what you would do is send 3btc to the sink address from address A. 3 bitcoins because anything you cant more than 10min for is going to cost less than 300 usd. Now that you have done this everyone on the block chain can see you have sent the it there. This means you are throwing your bitcoins away in a manner that everyone can verify that they aren't just being traded to a friend or back to yourself, or for some other received value. Thus you can say that that address is worth 3btc since the only way you can get that into the block chain is by throwing away 3btc in to the sink address.
Now say you go to mc donalds and you try to double spend on a .05 btc meal. You will probably get away with it in the sense that the btc comes back to you. However if enough clients detect that there is a difference between the accepted and stale block they have they will send a message transaction of one satoshi to the sink address and another to the double spender. This puts a record in the block chain showing the transactions of many different addresses sending the same paired transactions. These could be considered vote against that green address. If there enough votes a transaction is sent to the double spender(from sink address). The only way you can receive a transaction from the sink address is if you have enough votes to be considered a double spender. When that transaction makes it on to the block chain everyone can see that that address is no longer green. This means that even though you have double spent unless it is more than you threw into the sink address you have lost money, because that 3 btc you spent to make it green has gone to waste since you no longer have a green address trusted for 3 btc and the only way to get another one is to throw away another 3 btc. 
Edit: a word

I usually focus on telling them about how much they would have saved on my payment and how fast it is.

well 2% on a $1000 order is still $20 bitcoin still is only ~$0.06. If you are selling something with large margins 2% doesn't seem like much which it is not but if you do million in sales over a year that is $20,000 in savings nothing to sneeze at, we jump through more hoops to save that much in our internal processes, bitcoin is an easy 2% extra profit. If you sell something at low margins of profit 2 percent makes an even bigger difference. Walmart for example operates at 3-5% profit margin 2% is a lot. 
edit: misread your post, still $40 is a lot more than 6 cents. It also is easier for smaller/newer companies because they don't have to set up and account on Western Union.

I don't understand why PayPal doesn't integrate Bitcoin. They could become the biggest exchange overnight even if they do charge more than a percent. All they would have to do is have an additional policy that looks at the block chain to see if transactions took place and some sort of interface so the buyer of bitcoins can put in the recieve address which is securely sent to the seller of bitcoins. If the amount specified is transferred to that address they would have all of the proof they need. The buyer of the coins is responsible for putting in the right address. It would be person to person with no open orders or anything like a proper exchange but it would allow for anyone with PayPal buy Bitcoins from anyone else with PayPal and have Bitcoins they are willing to sell.

So if they have evidence that can prove the coins are actually his he will be compelled to give it up. However this would be used in terms of forfeiture and not in terms of gathering evidence so there might be a distinction there.

I wonder if the price differential is only due to everyone try to jump ship by converting to btc just so they can get their money out and into another exchange, that's probably why the arbitrage is so large since mt.gox has no liquidity. Shit I think i might just be figuring this whole finance thing out, its scary what you can teach yourself without trying.

From my understanding the private key could be compromised much more easily if the random number generator used to make it is not purely random. Is there a way we could get a manual random seed input where we just roll dice a bunch or flip a coin a fuck load, then put in the results.

Thanks for the link. I've opened it in every browser and even tried 2 different browser on a ubuntu virtual machine. The console says "XHR finished loading" then connected then disconnected. Every now and then it will throw an error "compressed bit must be 0 if no negotiated deflate-frame exttension" although even without this error it will still refuse to display. Maybe a few times a day it will show up for second then disappear. I can't be the only one to ever have this problem. It can't be my router either because my phone will display it over wifi.

I would argue that there way to much friction to adopt it because of a killer app. As much as people want that killer app its not going to give them the motivation to try and get hooked up with an exchange and all that noise.
Bitcoin is the killer app, there is just to much friction to get them to make it worth while. Maybe a hardware wallet with a simple way to buy bitcoins integrated with their system.

We don't use too many things that we directly print usually.  Most of the time we use our prints as proof of concepts, very early prototypes, and mold masters. We have an ultimaker if you are curious.
The last of our plastic(before this) was used to make the mold master for our first physical product the [TEC Tach]( We print off a slightly oversize version, sand a very nice finish, make silicon molds using it as a master, then use the molds to cast the final product in urethane(in this case the black bezel and the pick up lead). I know we need a better pitch video but once we get caught up on back orders we will get on that. Its also open source/hardware with good number of pins broken out for the hacker/maker community to use this as a gauge for anything. 
We currently selling through only one distributor [Midwest Super Cub]( but after we get through the backorders we will be redoing our website(which I'm not going to link due to embarassment) where we will also sell directly with bitcoin as an option to pay offering 25-50% discount when you purchase with bitcoin.

I think the fact that very few people have an income in btc is the limiting factor being to live using btc. Its kind of a chicken and the egg thing, you can't make money with bitcoin because no one(consumers) have bitcoin to spend conversely no one is getting paid in bitcoins because nobody has business that is supported by bitcoin. 
Obviously I'm generalizing to the mainstream, because these statements are false as there are many examples already. There aren't enough employed in the bitcoin economy to effectively cover all required sectors to "live" in the bitcoin economy. It might be possible currently, but it would just be adding a layer of converting money to bitcoins, it will be years,(depending on where you live) before you can actually live in the economy.

I'm not sure if you meant by liquidity, but Bitstamp is actually the one who is lacking liquidity, Mt.Gox has been tracking BTCchina's prices closely when converted back to USD. Bitstamp doesn't have access to buyers in china whereas the japanese can do much faster arbitration to BTCchina since they are in japan and can move funds quickly in and out of Mt.Gox.

Usually you don't want to announce online that you have $10,000(75*$130) worth of virtual currency.

No one votes on your transactions. The idea is that the miners would be the only one that want to do the checking because they get the transaction fee back in the block reward.
The btc that you send to the sink address is an investment in that address. The idea is if you are going to double spend at mc donalds on a .05 btc meal with an address that you sunk 1btc into would mean that you traded 1 btc you sunk to make that address green(clients could look for transactions to the sink address and tell the receiver how many btc of trust he can expect from that address) for .1btc (.05 for the meal + getting back the double spend .05).  As soon as your double spend attempt is detected there should be enough reports that the protocol will send you a satoshi from the sink address which the clients can see and know that if that address has received money from the sink address that it is no longer a green address.
The idea is not to stop double spending but make it less profitable to do so.

The biggest problem is getting Bitcoin in the hands of consumers and making it simple for them to store, secure, and exchange bitcoin. On the merchant's end I would say that BitPay is an excellent solution. They integrate with many of the popular eCommerce and shopping cart software platforms so it shouldn't be hard to get up and running and application to become a merchant is pretty simple and less stressful than setting up a paypal account with the added bonus of having extremely low fees.

I still don't see how it is possible for them to regulate bitcoin let alone what needs to be regulated. There has to be anonymous transactions, how else would anyone be able to do anything with any amount of privacy. How can companies keep their suppliers secret if there is no anonymity. Regulation would not be a problem if we didn't have these idiotic wars on drugs and "terrorism" there wouldn't be a problem.

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the gliph-space(available combinations of gliphs) limited to 3,368,000 unique users kind of makes the service useless if only 3 million people can use it. They need to add more gliphs and/or extend the maximum length although beyond 5 it gets unwieldy. Adding more gliphs will disadvantage early adopters because they could have gotten a more suitable combination.

Except since you stole my password it would still be fraud and they would still get my money back. The only person to lose would be the person who sent the bitcoins, which would happen only if your paypal account gets hacked which doesn't happen too often because even though they can reverse it, it still cost them money.
Also your bitcoin receive address would be like changing your email it would either give you an alert or email confirmation to change. This would mitigate fraud from false hacking, and if their paypal and email get hacked at the same time they are just out of luck on getting a chargeback because it could have been them trying to fraud the seller by making it look like they got hacked.

What with all of the negativity? 
I have plenty of web dev knowledge but the idea behind the site was to make it as simple, and fast as possible. Every time I google the answer to the question I have to read more than 5 words to figure out the answer. My goal was to make a site that answers it instantly at a glance. Doing anything more complex would only subtract from that goal.
This post wasn't meant to be begging for donation, why would I expect anyone to when I explicitly state it only took 15 minutes to do. It was meant to highlight the fact that you can add a revenue stream without taking almost anytime even for your smallest projects.

Its true that it is at least was easier to find dealers on the internet. However the security to make sure that you are 100% not traceable is a lot harder to do than just asking around to find a dealer and paying them cash and meeting somewhere, cash is faster simpler and easier to be anonymous.

If America was to outlaw bitcoins out right it might be able to drag a few countries with it that has a lot of influence over. The USD is the biggest tool at our disposal to influence other governments next to the military. 
Every country except obviously the US has suffered because of our hegemony on the global reserve country. I would be willing to bet that many countries would chose bitcoin over USD if they were forced to choose, partially because it take power away from the US while giving them a level playing field as well as more access to emerging markets(Africa will be the next China in the coming decades). 
If China continues at the rate it is other countries(most likely just their people) will start taking notice and not wanting to be left behind will jump on the bandwagon and then we will really start to see the price go vertical. I think the currency wars are just heating up, and we will see the largest global transfer(or at least shakeup) of wealth ever witnessed.

It was a drunk spur of the moment thing mostly intended for my own reference, if I don't get any it doesn't matter much to me.

I'm not asking you to donate. This was the first time I actually used bitcoin on a website. Until now I didn't really realize how much of a game changer it is, because without any web knowledge or third party I can accept bitcoin donations, just by putting one line of text in.

The problem with this is that the internet is physical and a massive endeavor that requires the whole of society to participate in the build out of the physical infrastructure. Bitcoin on the other hand is open source software. It would be easy enough for people to simply fork it off and start a new currency that doesn't have the privacy issues or any of this bullshit that we think is going to happen. That is why altcoins are important and shows the resilience of this type of money, if something is done to hurt its value or utility anyone can branch it and make one that fixes it. However since the miner ultimately decide it will be very interesting how this all plays out. 
The only problem is that with proof of work is the hardware is physical so if you branch it and not change the proof of work, a government or other large interest that has interest in keeping the current master branch successful  they could easily use their large hashing power to maliciously attack the new branch to deter people from using it.

You are only trusting miners with one vote against an address.  The miners client could automatically detect the double spend and send a 1 satoshi transaction to the sink and the double spenders to vote against that green addresses green status

I only paid $1554 everything included. I figure it will be 6 week payback, but I won't make a whole bunch after that. If I would have taken that same $1500 I spent at that time and just bought bitcoins I would have gotten 214 btc, or in $27500 at current prices, FML. I would say that I'm never buying mining hardware again but I've already invested all of my money and at current prices it will probably be cheaper to mine coins than buy at least for a while.
