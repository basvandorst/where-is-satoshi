Your followup is hilarious. BTC wasn't just *supposed* to be at the all time high 3 months ago, it *was* at its ATH at that point. Terrible time to invest as you literally could wait one more month and bought when it hit $3500, which I did. Also, the fact you were aware of BTC fluctuations and are still asking novice questions is quite amusing, given that you're doing it in the subreddit run by BTC shills who want you to buy their bags. Good luck in life

hey, friendly advice here (could save you a lot of trouble down the road): never invest your money, or anyone else's. you have a terrible intuition

I don't know what kind of retarded logic is being processed through your brain, nor do I wish to.

terrible time to do it now, wait for it to drop/stabilize

Now you know why it shot to 5800 right after hitting 5000. Demand and human psychology

They are created and awarded to people who "mine" them by computing solutions to a computationally expensive calculation. You can trade them like any other asset, and most commonly now they are bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges

impossible for retail miners. you either need to be part of a company or pool, or be running gray/black market systems like a botnet

Yeah, I love how "they" have already given me a flair as I'm trying to warn people off. How thoughtful
