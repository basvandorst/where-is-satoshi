This isn't actually bitcoin. They're launching their own product from what I read of it.
Basically it's a decentralized asset that they've centralized so they can profit off it.

still battling in the courts to get them back

Lucky you. I did the same. Mine were in mtgox...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:00:25
Mine are still in mtgox...that's worse, I didn't even get $20!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:14
Not a lot, but enough at the current prices!

Love it that mine are still in mtgox.

Laws have got nothing to do with what you said.
You said a Japanese company would have no consideration. Which is blatantly a stupid thing to say based on something you believe, but I don't know what.
Have a great day.

Some people had flat, some had btc, some had both.
He's liquidating some btc to pay today back first (done).
Then the court makes a decision on whether to pay back in the value it was then ($480/btc) or using CR (where people get btc back).
Second option doesn't seem fair to me, since that has already been paid out, so the btc holders are essentially being ripped off to pay the fiat holders in full.
Hope that helps. That's my understanding of the process anyway, the documentation is in Japanese with some slightly difficult to read translations. And I'm no lawyer...

I'm not American (British) and I happen to agree with the person above.

Mark karpeles happened...

Ironically, people did. That's exactly what's happening. Now we won't be able to resolve anything until those two cases are solved first...

Lucky you, I was once...
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:19:55
Because there wasn't enough left to pay everyone out.
And nobody...

Exactly what he was actually ADVISED to do
