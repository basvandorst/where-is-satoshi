EDIT: Well, Lopp said he counted them manually. I didn't count them, but there is also this:

EDIT2: Ok, I got it. So this shows all bitcoin nodes (cash and regular). ABC are the cash nodes, so you have to count the ABC Alibaba nodes.

Thanks for the explanation. But I don't get how the 148 chain would grow longer, with much less mining power? Wouldn't the block time be substantially larger than on the legacy chain, and thus growth much slower?
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:46:22
The "when" is when the uasf gets &gt;50% hashpower. So when = never, I guess?
No miner will switch to a chain with zero economic activity on it.

Why would the original chain disappear if almost all miners and businesses keep using it?
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:02:05


There is none. 2MB might be totally save. (
Also I recommend this quick rant from the CEO and Co-Founder of blockchain.info (one of the last "bitcoin-only" businesses, and a biz that propably brought more users to bitcoin than all the others combined): 


This, and some people also fear that "the industry" dictates the direction of bitcoin going. I don't really think it's a problem. Each hardfork would again require the whole network to upgrade. There will be the same discussions held. Also, why not increase the blocksize, as average bandwidth and storage costs sink.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:44:09
This. Exchanges couldn't care less. They make fees if there are competing chains. Just look how quickly Poloniex added ETC.
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:43:14


saying things like "uasf or gtfo",  "ppl that don't follow 148 are forking themselves of" and "miners that don't support 148 are attacking bitcoin", creating a reckless chainsplit, wearing ugly hats, astroturfing, the list goes on and on...


As low as flying to china and lobbying miners not to run that code? (funnily enough, two of the most vocal uasf supporters from core were there)


At least none of them created a phishing site to trick users into downloading their consensus-breaking software.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:19:58
Segwit2x will activate segwit, all core nodes will accept it, and uasf'ers will claim success, because they pressured miners to do so. IMO the most likely outcome.
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:34:56


Wow. That's a new low for uasf'ers.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:25:51


I also think the timeframe is rushed and I am not a fan of segwit2x either. Imo a 2MB hardfork should have been done years ago.


Absolute max is 8mb, I know. But we don't know if miners set soft-limits, or how quickly and widely segwit will be adopted.


I meant future hardforks. If the fear is that the one-time increase sets a precedent for further increases, each increase will require a hardfork, and thus it's not easy, so the argument of "setting a precedent" is a weak one, imo.


But they are somehow. Not solely, but as PoW is the only truly measurable form of consent, we are dependent on miners. Any other metric can easily be sybilled. If people think this is wrong, then these people have to admit that bitcoin does not work as intended and is fundamentally broken.
Imo, miners act in perfect alignment with bitcoin. They are supposed to be greedy, that's the most basic principle. And even if Jihan uses covert asicboost, it's just what the protocol allows him to do. Rational miners (imo, they are rational, and neither dumb nor malicious), will always do what is best for their pockets. This means they also want a healthy network and a high price. Now if he adopts segwit, he loses his (potential) asicboost edge and also opens the door for 2nd layers (loss of fees). He sees the "health increase" as minor, compared to his loss. So it's just the rational thing for them to demand more onchain capacity that compensates for that loss. Imo, bitcoin is working perfectly. But sure, more miner decentralization would be welcome.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:51:53


@_date: 2017-07-12 21:01:45
Segwit activation via segwit2x is still a softfork, yes.
Only difference in the segwit2x activation method is that it needs much less time and less hashpower for signaling (only 80% hashpower over 2.3 days). Then segwit is locked in (and core nodes accept that lock-in).
The 2x hardfork triggers ~3 months after segwit is locked in. Will be interesting to watch, if miners and businesses follow through with the HF or not.
Good read there:

So it's an honest phishing site. Gotcha.


As bitcoin is not only a thechnical, but also a economical experiment, you should also consider to listen to economical actors.


There have never been more than 30% of support for segwit. Bitmain does not control 70%. Miners just aren't happy with segwit as sole scaling progress.


You know what open source means?

If BIP148 wasn't such a lousy ridiculous plan, a UASF would naturally attract the miners, as most economic actors would follow the UASF chain and abandon the old chain, thus making the tokens on it less valuable.
But as no economic actors follows BIP148 as of now (I don't count the reddit shills as economically relevant), there is absolutely no reason for any miner to mine on that chain.

I have no source, it's just logical thinking. And even if they express their opinion, it won't matter much. In case of a hf they will list both chains anyways (alone to not get in legal trouble).
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:22:58


It's a reckless network split by a minority without any preparation time. Not even BU was this reckless when they almost had 50% hashpower for a brief moment.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:10:45
No, they (and everybody) will own all their coins on both chains. And dump the useless uasf coins. But be happy, "buy dem cheeeap coins" ;-)
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:28:45


But it doesn't really matter anyways. The exchanges don't care if the chain splits. They make money by providing trading pairs for multiple chains. They will gladly add each fork, just as they started adding shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:07:25


Yup. The NY agreement, with 80% hashpower and a shitton of businesses backing it.

Isn't it great with crypto? No trust needed and we can simply look at the delivered code and then decide to run it or not.
Btw, you're annoying and non-constructive.
