This OP. 
I use coinbase and I have it pull $1 a week from my bank acct. I know some weeks I'll get more BTC and others less. The transaction history shows me a list of the equivalent / conversion of USD/BTC at time of transaction. 
You can do this internationally when you sell. If I buy from you on January 11 a fridge for 1BTC / $1k USD, on the receipt, you show that conversion on date of purchase with a refund policy stating you will honor the equivalent within thirty days of purchase. 
Two weeks later, I come in and say, "you know, my fridge hasn't been working out. It just takes up too much room in my kitchen and it is hard to cook with it bumping out. Can I get a refund and / or exchange it. BTC has dropped to $825 USD on January 28. You refund 1.212BTC. No one had gained or lost.
Say I'm from the UK. Same scenario but conversion to GBP(pound I think?). 
The great thing about BTC is that it is all done on the computer and your engineers can write the code to handle all of this automatically. You can easily show it on the receipt like my coinbase example at the beginning. 
As BTC becomes common place, this won't matter as much. It will be as common as the dollar (hopefully) and then a conversion to the USD will be a thing of the past. 
For those thinking about taxes and all that: again engineering and automation. Time to pay taxes? Transaction histories + local currency conversion + loss / gains can be computed automatically and sent to accounting to take care of that.
Besides, if you're really at such a big corp, you're not paying many govt taxes.

True. From an accountants POV, they'd want to shoot me for the paperwork.
