I was about to panic sell in August when it dipped down to 3k. I had my coins in cold storage. I rushed to get them back to the exchange. The mempool was clogged. Transaction times were like 2 Hours. I closed my lap top out of frustration and took a nap. Woke up and we were already back near 4K. The transaction had gone through, but I didn’t sell. I learned the true meaning of hodl in that very moment. Now look. Look where we are. 
All these transaction problems will be solved in time for it to really matter. I firmly believe this.

You cant spend from a paper wallet. Get BitPay, scan your private key, and “sweep” the total amount from the paper wallet into your new BitPay wallet. If you don’t sweep the entire amount, then you’ll risk losing the unswept amount. Now that your balance is in your BitPay wallet, you can use it to spend.

It’s in the article. Basically, data is sent into the future using the bitcoin network. It then records the price of the bitcoin and is downloaded back to the present time. Investors buy or sell depending on the bitcoin’s future price.

“Testing” on other mammals is futile. For one, a corpse is already a corpse. You can’t do any more harm. You’re basically donating your body to science at this point instead of rotting or burning away. Secondly, why waste the time and resources testing on a chimp?

Fees are high because bitcoin is blowing up. Fixes are on the way. But if you want to buy bitcoin at an all time high when it’s on its rise to becoming an entirely new asset class a few hours after futures begin using a crypto “bank,” then you’re going to pay some fees. I’ve been hodling in cold storage for a while. I don’t pay any fees. This is a speculative asset. You’ll learn.

Sounds like we need quantum-abled cryptography. What makes you think that anyone able to crack crypto with a quantum computer won’t just secure crypto with a quantum computer. I mean, I’m no expert, but I’d imagine that anything a QC can do to crack sha256 can also be used to secure it.

I’m one that doesn’t totally understand. I’m trying to wrap my head around what “trades at a premium” means. Does that mean it is overpriced compared to owning actual BTC? So if I buy $5k worth of gbtc, I’m not really getting 5k worth of bitcoin in value? 
Also, when BTC was at $3k, 1 share of gbtc was $700. Now btc is $7000 but gbtc is only $950. Is this also because of the premium?

Gold has legacy value. It's valuable today because that has just been the tradition for thousands of years. Once science and technology come along and poke holes in your tradition, you get pissed. What science and tech has taught us is that gold really isn't any more "valuable" than any other "precious" metal. But the traditionalists still trade it and hold it high. Can an average gold owner really do anything with their gold? No. Even as jewelry, it's becoming obsolete. Gold is not practical like it was 1000 years ago. Giving gold and other "shiny objects" value only reinforces our need for a change in our monetary system.  The internet of things has way more value than gold ever did in history. Clinging to gold and pushing away crypto is like trading in your wheel for nothing but smoother terrain that you now must walk.

Bitcoin adoption is too low and the price too volatile to use for regular every day purchases at this point. Once it goes mainstream, the price should stabilize and it'll be a better option for buying things. But we're all just early adopters trying to get in on the future. It'll take another generation for mainstream use to kick in.  All the old people who fear tech have to die off. Our kids, hearing about us holding coins, will be the ones to have organic interest in crypto. So just hold tight.

The whole article contradicts itself. The first half is all fud. Then at the end the author says that the guy believes in blockchain and likes it for the future.

In my opinion, this is a multi step process. The first thing you should do is validate your wife’s concerns while also trivializing them. Tell her she’s right, but right in an obvious way. “Yeah honey. Bitcoin is really volatile and unpredictable. Like any investment, bitcoin could tank. Kinda like the housing market and big banks did in ‘08. lol. Market tend to bounce back though.”  Continue on with light hearted discussion of matters related to economy and bitcoin. Agree with and validate all of her ideas and comments.
Then, the next few times you guys are out and about, spend some money on something stupid and solely for yourself. Maybe an expensive drink before dinner, an additional pair of name brand shoes, a new phone case, or a big chocolate cake at the grocery store. You get the drift. 
After she sees you making those purchases and enjoying what you’ve bought, you initiate a conversation about how bitcoin has gone up. Then you recount all those things you wasted your money on, add up the balance, and say something like,
“I didn’t need that fancy drink or chocolate cake, etc, I should have invested that money in bitcoin. I’d be happier right now if I had $50 in bitcoin to show for my money instead of just enjoying a drink or whatever for a few minutes. See what I mean, babe? I’m done spending money on consumerist bullshit. I want to invest in the future! What do you say? $10 here, $30 there. It’s the same thing. And it’ll make me happier than a chocolate cake.”
If THAT doesn’t work. Then, yeah. Maybe find a new wife or get counseling. Lol. Jk. Just make sure you’re not spending money you guys don’t have on bitcoin. Because that’s reason for your wife to not want you to do it. Respect your wife. But she also needs to respect you.

So then how is it legal to make peer to peer bitcoin transactions? If my buddy wants to buy $100 worth but is not set up on an exchange, is it illegal for me to get him some? Or maybe just illegal in the hundreds of thousands of dollars? Not so much with small amounts?

Memes just aren’t for teenagers. Memes are a medium of expression made possible by widespread computer usage. They are a product of the internet. Marginalizing their importance is like Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud. 
You’re right; bitcoin was made to be used as a currency. But right now, the market is young, volatile, and unpredictable. People are hodling for that reason. No one wants to be the 10,000 btc pizza guy. As more people begin to buy and hodl, the value will stabilize and you’ll see more transactions. The idea of hodl is to maintain your position through out the volatility because one day the market will stabilize and your coins will have a greater value than they do today. 
Lastly, I don’t know much about Charlie Lee. But from what I hear he’s a good developer with an advance education who started a crypto that has a market cap in the billions! If that’s what you call “reasonable intelligence”  and sounding like a moron, then sign me up!

I’m sorry. I probably should have mentioned more clearly that my goal in making the list is to illustrate 1) that most of the arguments against bitcoin come from powerful, old-money banks and billionaires who fear a loss of control and 2) that bright, inventive minds are more inclined to see the benefits of bitcoin in the future. With these examples, I’d like to raise questions in people’s minds about embracing a new monetary future as opposed to hanging on to the systems of the past.

A rule I learned a while back but didn’t follow is this: Once you’re invested in crypto, always do the opposite of what your emotions tell you. When you’re at an absolute low, and you want to sell it all and burn your laptop, that’s when you buy. Conversely, when you’re on top of the world, and you feel like crypto is finally going to “get you a Lambo,” that’s when you sell. If I had followed this, I’d be up $100k.
