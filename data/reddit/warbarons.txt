Perhaps I'm missing something but it sounds like LN will mainly be useful for purchases type of transactions.
I would guess that 90%+ of transactions in bitcoin is going to a exchange either from a personal wallet or another exchange. The use case of bitcoin has mostly been trading/investing/hodling.
Being able to use bitcoin to buy things is of course a improvement but am I correct when I read about LN and think that it wont help me send my x BTC between exchanges and my wallet or between my favourite exchanges.

My suggestion is to buy more bitcoin with fiat. To do something like this quite a lot of people would have to participate to reach a decent amount of fiat to buy for. For some people $50 might be possible to buy and for others $500.
You might already have bought bitcoins and not really want to buy more but you probably want them to increase in value. The question is would you be willing to buy some more if there is a possibility that the price goes up with another bubble.
From the page I created: 
It's a simple idea. If you want bitcoin to enter another growth phase show your interest and join with the amount that you could buy more bitcoin for in october. To participate you fill out the form with how much you want to participate. It's nothing binding just a way to show the rest of the community that you are willing to contribute. Before october 15th transfer that amount to your favourite exchange. Sometime between october 15th and november 15th you will receive a e-mail to purchase for 25% for example, you then simply buy bitcoin with 25% of the money you have on the exchange. The decision when to buy will not be mine to make, a random program will run each day and decide when to buy and email everyone who joined.

**Quick info**:
What: A free chance to win some BTC while playing a good oldschool turn based strategy game.
When: The tournament starts on 17th of may.
Where: Tournament located here: [Tournament]( 
To join signup an account here: [Warbarons]( 
**Background info**:
We are two programmers who have been creating/running/playing a strategy game the last 6
years. We ran a Kickstarter years ago and along with our own money and what we got from
kickstarter we followed our dream to create a game.
Warbarons is heavily influenced by the warlords game series popular in the early nineties and our game has gathered a community of older players who used to be gamers 20 years ago who played these type of games.
It's built for multiplayer and we have been balancing and finetuning it for a couple of years now. One of our dreams is to run tournaments and ladders where money is involved, it's what we wished for 15 years ago when we were hard core gamers playing starcraft online. 
Bitcoin is awesome for doing something like this. When people try to figure out some application
where bitcoin could be useful enough to draw people into using bitcoin online games about money is one such application. 
Our game is not very popular among teenagers unfortunately, it's a game where you need to think
and plan. No quick action. But we hope that there are old gamers, and perhaps some younger ones too who could be interested in joining our tournament here within the bitcoin community. It's free to signup and free to join the tournament.
The prizes are not big, it's one bitcoin spread over many placings. You just need to win 1 or 2 games to make something.
If this tournament has some success we plan to run more give away tournaments.

Will Liquid Network add supply to bitcoin? If there are for example 1 million L-BTC that are interchangeable with BTC at 1 to 1 and people start using that for transacting between exchanges that should have the same effect as BTC supply being 22 million. What are your thoughts?

Okay right so the btc is frozen. Where is it frozen? What type of control is holding it?

Also a reader of both subs plus a bunch other. I would not say they they are doing a horrible job, I'd say they are doing really well. They been able to stop on-chain scaling so far. They control much of the development of bitcoin, they have much control over the opinion through control and censorship over the most popular online bitcoin forums. By now nobody in this forum is questioning their ideas and any idea coming from any other place is seen with suspicion. 
For someone who is reading multiple subs, it's clear that they are very successful in pushing their agenda forward. It's a slow thing that takes years but so far it's surly going in their direction.
BTC sub formed as a result of that and now that is split as well between those who "gave up bitcoin" and put their hope in BCH and those who stil have hopes for bitcoin left (2x supporters). But yes I think you are right that there is a certain amount of hatred directed to bitcoin and it probably coming from frustration of having something you love and are passionate about being taken control over by someone who have another agenda. Just like many people here believe 2x is a corporate takeover and hate that, the same thing already happened to the people in /BTC it's just a different corporation.

Yes there is. We need a abbreviation that we can spam in every discussion thread to show that we exist just like the USAF cult do. SW2MB now!!

As a developer, yeah this is more or less standard. I would also add that most developers aren't the right people to lead a company or even lead a group of people. We are good with code but that does not make us good at leading a company or a group of people.

When there are many parties invested in bitcoin don't you think it's quite selfish to refuse to negotiate a solution that includes the other sides?

With 80% hash rate signed on it sounds like they are willing to agree to signal for segwit + a 2 mb blockchain increase. Refusing to give the option a chance when they have put their name on it wont move us forward.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:04:29


Agree. Judging by the latest segwit2x progress a split seems very unlikely.
