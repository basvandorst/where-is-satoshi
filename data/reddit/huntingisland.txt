How exactly is Bitcoin supposed to go north of $1000 / coin when the network gets backlogged with a move to $450?
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:43:20
I would sell with such a large premium on the BTC in the fund. This kind of mispricing of assets in exchange funds can swing the other way to where a 20% fall in BTC price could lead to a 50% loss in your investment value.

Here is the summary:
1) A 1MB limit was put in place, years ago by Satoshi Nakamoto, when bitcoin average block size / transaction volume was a few percent of today's, solely to stop a spam / denial of service attack on the bitcoin network.
2) Satoshi always intended that the limit be raised - this was solely to protect the network and was always intended to be above normal transaction size.
3) Now the network normal transaction volume is reaching the point where many blocks are hitting the 1MB limit.
4) Fixing the 1MB limit is changing a single constant value in the source code files for full Bitcoin nodes / miners. It is as easy as it gets.
5) Most of the important participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem want the 1MB limit raised right now, before it causes serious congestion on the network and prevents the large increases in growth of Bitcoin / price increases in store from happening.
6) A few people, including some on the Bitcoin Core team, are unwilling to increase the 1MB limit. They keep talking about how we "should" throttle back bitcoin network traffic through fee increases and that someday there will be new technologies that will reduce blockchain size such as segregated witness and off-blockchain solutions that many Bitcoin Core team members are working on and invested in, such as the proposed "Lightning Network".
7) None of these technologies are tested and proven, unlike the core Bitcoin protocol which has been running 6+ years. We are talking about thousands of lines of code that need to be written and tested that will have never been used on the real Bitcoin network, versus a single line of code.
8) In the meantime, blocks are completely full at least some of the time. Yesterday we saw several hours when the Bitcoin network was generating full blocks. The problem is NOW!

Unfortunately, transaction rate is now maxed out, thanks to the 1MB hardcoded limit holdouts.
This needs to be fixed ASAP or we are all going to see a precipitous drop in the USD/BTC value of our HODLings.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:32:44
The system is at lockup transaction volume right now. Absolutely no way we are going to new highs when the system is incapable of growth until the absurd 1MB limit is raised.
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:21:56
Sorry, this is just misinformation.
There is absolutely no good reason to stay with a hard-coded 1MB limit which was only put in place as an anti-spam limit when blocks were less than 100K.
Today the blocks were full at 1MB for long stretches of time.
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:22:35
Thanks. For right now I am only interested in accumulating bitcoins, not spending them, so I will look into both of these solutions.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:03:40
Blocks were full today. Having spare transaction capacity is not a "very minor improvement", it's critical to QoS and adoption rates, and to the future value of your currency.

Please explain where what I wrote is in error.


Um, the bitcoin-dev mailing list is run by the 1MB holdouts.
The bitcoin network is -- right now -- today -- maxed out at 1MB - most blocks are full, we are literally at capacity given that artifical limit. This is a huge problem given the exponential (until now!) growth of Bitcoin transactions and smoothed market cap.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:13:52
I write software for a living. Moving up the 1MB limit to 4MB or 8MB is as easy as it comes. All the other so-called "solutions" are much more difficult and, in the end, we will need to increase blocksize soon enough anyway (assuming Bitcoin becomes relevant to the global financial system, which I hope we all want to happen).

Like I said, Bitcoin already chose social consensus over the code and blockchain once, and nobody complained.
I don't think it's all that important that it is easier to fake a proof-of-stake blockchain over a proof-of-work one, when there is a community and protocol consensus on the approved validators. At the end of the day people can always agree to change the software rules anyway.

1) Create a wallet using a web wallet generator
2) Go to  pick your new cryptocurrency, input your new wallet address, and click the "Shift" button.
3) Send BTC to the address ShapeShift gives you. Wait for the coins.
Takes about 10 minutes of work, and then depending on how much BTC you are transforming you might have to wait for one or more BTC confirmations until the ShapeShift is complete.

I'm not a spammer, but you are someone who spreads made up derogatory lies about people based on Vizzini logic:
Background: VIZZINI, played by Wallace Shawn, has kidnapped the Princess BUTTERCUP, and The MAN IN BLACK (ManInBlack), aka the DreadPirateRoberts, aka Westley, played by CaryElwes, is attempting to rescue her.
VIZZINI: So, it is down to you. And it is down to me.
The MAN IN BLACK nods and comes nearer.
VIZZINI: If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward.
VIZZINI pushes his long knife harder against BUTTERCUP's unprotected throat.
MAN IN BLACK: Let me explain...
VIZZINI: There's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.
MAN IN BLACK: Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
VIZZINI: There will be no arrangement [pauses, deliberately] and you're killing her!
VIZZINI jabs with his long knife. BUTTERCUP gasps against the pain. The MAN IN BLACK stops quickly.
MAN IN BLACK: But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
VIZZINI: I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
MAN IN BLACK: You're that smart?
VIZZINI: Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
MAN IN BLACK: Yes.
VIZZINI: Morons.
MAN IN BLACK: Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
VIZZINI: For the Princess?
The MAN IN BLACK nods.
VIZZINI: To the death?
The MAN IN BLACK nods.
VIZZINI: I accept.
MAN IN BLACK: Good. Then pour the wine.
VIZZINI fills the goblets with wine. The MAN IN BLACK pulls a small packet from his clothing and hands it to VIZZINI.
MAN IN BLACK: Inhale this, but do not touch.
VIZZINI: I smell nothing.
MAN IN BLACK: [Takes the packet back] What you do not smell is called Iocaine powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the deadlier poisons known to man.
VIZZINI: Hmm.
VIZZINI watches as the MAN IN BLACK takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces VIZZINI, drops the Iocaine packet. It is now empty. The MAN IN BLACK rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of VIZZINI and the other in front of himself.
MAN IN BLACK: All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead.
VIZZINI: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's? [pauses to study the MAN IN BLACK] Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
MAN IN BLACK: You've made your decision then?
VIZZINI: Not remotely. Because iocaine comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
MAN IN BLACK: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
VIZZINI: Wait till I get going! Where was I?
MAN IN BLACK: Australia.
VIZZINI: Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
MAN IN BLACK: [beginning nervousness] You're just stalling now.
VIZZINI: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
MAN IN BLACK: [nervously] You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
VIZZINI: [triumphant] It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
MAN IN BLACK: [fool's courage] Then make your choice.
VIZZINI: I will. And I choose [stops suddenly and points at something behind the Man in Black] what in the world can that be?
MAN IN BLACK: [Turns, looks] What? Where? I don't see anything.
VIZZINI quickly switches the goblets while the MAN IN BLACK has his head turned.
VIZZINI: Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.
The MAN IN BLACK turns to face him again. VIZZINI starts to laugh.
MAN IN BLACK: What's so funny?
VIZZINI: I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
And he picks up his goblet. The MAN IN BLACK picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, VIZZINI hesitates a moment. Allowing the MAN IN BLACK to drink first, he swallows his wine.
MAN IN BLACK: You guessed wrong.
VIZZINI: [roaring with laughter] You only think I guessed wrong... [louder now] ...that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. Ha-ha, you fool.
The MAN IN BLACK sits silently.
VIZZINI: You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is "Never get involved in a land war in Asia." But only slightly less well known is this: "Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!Ahahahaha, ahahahaha, ahahaha--
thud *
VIZZINI laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. The MAN IN BLACK steps past his corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off BUTTERCUP, who notices VIZZINI lying dead. The MAN IN BLACK pulls her to her feet.
BUTTERCUP: Who are you?
MAN IN BLACK: I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
The MAN IN BLACK leads her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain.
BUTTERCUP: [Glances back toward the fallen VIZZINI] To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
MAN IN BLACK: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to Iocaine powder.

The problem is, electronic money is very insecure. All you need is someone's private keys, then you can instantly bankrupt them with no hope of recovery. That's not at all user friendly!
Ethereum allows creating programmable rules so that thieves can't easily siphon away your money. So it's actually much better money for the masses than Bitcoin is, once the infrastructure gets built up a bit.
Yes, there are some add-ons to Bitcoin to alleviate some of the security issues, but Ethereum allows programming of robust solutions to these kinds of issues.
I don't know if Ethereum will succeed or not, but it is doing all kinds of things that make me think it has a good shot at it. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is fighting a civil war whether it should even be generally usable as money or not, and some people imagine it can become digital gold without being useful as money first.

Well first of all, Ethereum is designed as a distributed contract-based computing environment, for all types of uses, not just as money (although it does that too).
Technologically, Ethereum right now features 15 second block confirmation time, allows turing-complete executable code on the blockchain, is planning for proof-of-stake validation in a future release, has smaller transaction sizes, easier to create spending policies on accounts than Bitcoin, no ongoing civil war about blocksize.
That said, it's a very immature platform regarding actual usage right now (blockchain just began six months ago). So Bitcoin is a much more polished product to actually use. 
Getting into Ethereum now is like getting into Bitcoin 5 years ago, and there is of course no guarantee that Ethereum will have the same kind of success that Bitcoin did.
I still hold more value in BTC than ETH, although if the ETH price keeps going up that might change in the next few days.

The empty blocks are found while the miners are still validating the previous block. Therefore the only alternative for them is to completely shut off their hugely expensive ASICs while validation is occurring. They can't hash for a full block until all the validation operations are completed.
Turning of their ASICs during validation would not lead to a faster overall network.
Basically, the empty blocks are the time cost of network propagation and validation speed.

My own view (owning both BTC and ETH) is that if Ethereum succeeds it will end up replacing all other financial tokens and currencies. That's not something the developers talk about, but it seems like it would happen due to network effects.
A lot will depend on the currency issuance policy - which is still to be determined. If ETH issuance ends up being currency inflationary in the long term, I believe people would naturally prefer a token like BTC with a strictly limited maximum.

Yes, you could write a smart contract to do that.
People could "call" your contract with a small amount of ether fuel and it would execute that code on the global Ethereum computer / blockchain.
For something "hello, world" like that, it would make sense to run it for free on the testnet. The live Ethereum blockchain makes sense for things like automated car rental agreements, title recording, legal affadavits, programmatic money (like an account you can only spend $1000 / week out of, so a thief cannot bankrupt you overnight), and millions of other uses that haven't been thought of yet.

P2SH is an add-on, and it is not Turing-complete. The EVM is a much better development platform.

The empty blocks happen as a function of the way block propagation and validation works.
Basically, once miners get the header of a new block they immediately begin building a zero transaction (empty) block until they receive the entire block, validate all the transaction in that block, then remove those transactions from the mempool.
If they find a new block solution any time before completing these processes, they publish the new block.
So the empty blocks actually don't slow down the network processing, and they do add to security (by increasing block height).
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:51:37

1) Soft forking is a terrible idea for a financial network. It basically means that anyone who doesn't upgrade is blindly validating transactions they don't understand because they have been tricked. Far better to get those old nodes off the network.
2) Segwit is a very complex change to how Bitcoin works - it is risky. Changing one line for a blocksize change is far less risky.
3) Segwit only gets the size benefits of 1.6ish MB when everyone upgrades.
4) Blocks are full now. Segwit won't fully deliver 1.6MB for half a year to a year+.
5) The current Segwit proposal unreasonably favors extended block transaction size over main block transaction size.
6) Bitcoin doesn't get to be the reserve currency just because it exists. It has to earn its place there by being better money. Money that can be used by only a few tens of thousands of people to run their financial transactions is not better money, it is a speculative bubble in search of a pin.
7) There is a compelling near-future competitor to Bitcoin in Ethereum getting enormous traction right now. It's not afraid to scale and is coming with technical features that Bitcoin cannot match. If Bitcoin refuses to scale, it's going to get blown out of the water by this or another competitor.
8) The best way to decentralize Bitcoin is to make it more valuable and important. That means it has to be useful. Ever-increasing transaction fees, delayed confirmations, and an inability to handle more traffic all make Bitcoin less and less useful.

No, I'm simply noting that I don't trust the opinions of the small-blockers who hang out on bitcoin wizards. Their position on a modest blocksize increase vs. the complexity, new code, and mess of a soft fork for SW is very wrong. And they censor opposing viewpoints. Why would I give their attacks on Ethereum any validity?
As for the project wasting money on multiple implementations - agreed. But they appear to be on a much better track now.

I missed my opportunity to buy 1000 BTC for $20 in 2009 or 2010. A guy offered to send Bitcoin for that price if you mailed him a check with your Bitcoin address.

This is utter nonsense.
Ethereum shares (Ethers) were sold to the public in a presale to fund development. In addition, the Ethereum foundation was given 17%  of the initial shares (Ethers) as additional funds for paying developers in Ethers for those who wanted to take that option. There is absolutely nothing at all unethical about any of this!

There are very many value propositions to a blockchain, just like there are many value propositions to a global computer network, or to a smartphone with apps.
Just for starters, it's a far superior way to verifiably register public records in a way that is public and low cost and cannot be hacked or erased.

Not if you generate your own seed by hand.
The only way they could then steal your funds if there is a leak between the stored seed / private key and the computer which is then exploited by the PC-side wallet code.

Gold only became money because it was actually useful as money (to everyone).
Right now Bitcoin is useful as money to about 1 million people, out of 7 billion. It must upgrade its transaction capability or it will never grow in value, and will in fact shrink.

They didn't get their Ether, or Bitcoin back.
They got a heavily-discounted cash value for their Bitcoin and Ether. Meanwhile both tokens have returned 100%+ in the 9 months since. I don't see Bitfinex offering to reimburse their customers for the opportunity cost.
@_date: 2016-02-07 06:43:28
You aren't listening.
There are many projects who would like to use Bitcoin but they can't and won't because they would double or quadruple the current transaction load on the network which is maxed out.
3 transactions per second is about enough transaction volume to work as money for a few hundred thousand people. That's it. If Bitcoin doesn't grow, it will be replaced by a cryptocurrency that will.

But the problem is, absolutely everything is wildly overpriced by speculation, precisely because of the policies of the world's central banks since 2008-2009.
Gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum are right now being priced as options on the potential that the ECB, Fed, PBOC and BOJ end up blowing up the global financial system and that the monetary value of fiat currencies ends up flowing into non-centralized non-debt-based currencies with a predictable and finite issuance model. I would suspect that as a Brazilian citizen you are quite familiar with what happens when a currency is repudiated because of unpayable excess debt and over-issuance.
I think we are in a race between the madness of the central bankers (helicopter money, anyone?) and finishing a scalable, decentralized cryptocurrency (my money is on the Ethereum team to deliver this).
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:55:16
I think people are buying gold as a put option against the madness of the world's central bankers and their unpayable, exponentially-growing mountain of debt. That it is priced so highly is because of the irresponsibly mad course we are on.

That's because a lot of people have just **stopped using** Bitcoin.
For example, I am a professional cryptocurrency trader. I used to provide liquidity on Kraken, Polo and GDAX. I used Bitcoin to provide liquidity on Polo, since they don't have any fiat channels (no, Tether doesn't count). But dealing with the unreliability of Bitcoin was such a hassle that I simply dropped the use of the Bitcoin network completely and instead of trading on Polo I'm adding a Gemini endpoint.
I went from sending hundreds of thousands of dollars per month using Bitcoin, in dozens of individual Bitcoin transactions, to not sending a single Bitcoin transaction in the last month. Not coincidentally, I traded my Bitcoin inventory for a different crypto platform when I stopped using it.
