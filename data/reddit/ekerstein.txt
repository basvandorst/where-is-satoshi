Make sure you verify your transactions through your node. That's kind of the whole point. Doesn't add much if you're not doing that!
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:37:48
Yes, you can use it as a wallet. Make sure to put a passphrase on your wallet. There is an option in Bitcoin Core (if you're using that) to add one.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:30:24
No, only miners get fees. A non-mining node is useful because you can validate your transactions in the blockchain without trusting anyone else. It's kind of like a cashier checking for counterfeit bills.

It uses [this]( site for the per byte fee and uses an average tx size of 250 bytes. 21.co is a legit site so I trust those numbers.
It seems accurate to me and yesterday when I sent a tx it was about $4-$5 to get included in the next block. But i'm happy to look at other sources if you have them.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:13:01
No worries. I also look at the mempool pretty often at [this]( site (there are so bitcoin data sites out there). You can see that the high fee groups have been increasing lately. To be fair I think the recent spike is being caused by the hashrate [weirdness]( going on between BTC and BCH but it's probably fair to say that we'd have high fees even with normal block speeds.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:13:13
You're describing a system in which a small group of vocal people can stop any change. That's unsustainable. Imagine if we ran our government by super-super-majority. Nothing would change, nothing would adapt. The system would be completely hamstrung. Sound familiar?
If a relatively large contingent of the community feels strongly about something, they should try it out. If it fails, so be it. That's the only way Bitcoin improves. Yes, it causes chaos, but that's a side effect of an all-inclusive decentralized process with no leaders.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:35:25
It's hugely dependent on mempool size. This has varied quite a bit in the past couple weeks, but fees are at highest point (in satoshis) over the last year.

Miners are allowed to decide which transactions get included in their block by design. Question is: why is Bitcoin in a position to be so concerned about the actions of one miner?
Answer: because we've allowed ourselves to be put in the shitty position of praying that every miner helps reduce the huge backlog in the mempool. The backlog caused by the 1mb cap that we refused to change.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:52:27
It's not just the default fees set by the wallet, but also a large part on the mempool. It's hard to compare across transactions because mempool varies a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:48:52
Good points. Agreed on both. The hashrate fluctuations seem to be a new normal (for the time being), so it's a new consideration for calculating fees imo.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:00:21
Yes, it's a new account. I'm not sure why it says for a day, i've had it for a week now. See my other reply. Some could certainly be spam, but we're seeing slow mempool clearing even at higher fees.
There are plenty of good explanations like more public interest, higher price, etc. No need for conspiracy theories. We've had full blocks for a while now.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:18:56
Actually, they did attempt with a BIP and meetings where core devs were invited. I don't have a position either way but I'm amazed how many people are expert pollsters on this subreddit. Please reveal your source for how many devs and users want segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:51:55
To be fair, only about half are doing that for Bitcoin. Despite BCH being more profitable, BTC still has 50-60% of it's previous hashrate. BCH on the other hand seems almost entirely run by profit-driven miners.
I still don't see the problem though. This is exactly why we need to make BTC the best and most profitable coin, so miners are incentivized to mine it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:49:36


The problem is how do you define "decentralization"? And what is an adequate amount? Several people have written articles about how they think it should be defined, like [Paul Sztorc]( who believes the measure should be the cost of operation a full node (i.e. smaller cost = more decentralization).
By design we are accepting a certain level of decentralization and forgoing more. For example why not reduce the blocksize to 500kb? Wouldn't that in theory allow more people to run it? Or how about making average block times 30 minutes instead of 10 to reduce the speed that the blockchain grows?
What about our dev team - is that too decentralized? Should we be encouraging more people to run different implementations? Or miners - what's the highest share a miner should have?
You could also define decetralization as who owns the coin. If fees skyrocket and only the rich can buy Bitcoin, is that decentralized? What about all the people in third-world countries we used to talk about helping? If they can't buy is it truly decentralized?
There are many perspectives to this discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:22:30
What's also beautiful is when incentives align. Have you asked why miners want segwit2x given that it will lower their per tx fees?
It's because they know the same thing that business owners know: low fees will cause bitcoin price to grow, market share to grow, and public adoption to grow. In the end, that's a win for the miners and a win for the users. 
Yes, miners respond to incentives and it's great that the system incentivizes them to want bitcoin to flourish.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:34:33
Were you paying attention to BCH at all and the hash rate? There was actually a lot going on yesterday that would warrant transactions and speculation.
"hurry" doesn't have much to do with it. The mempool is likely full because Bitcoin is popular and people are making transactions.
Often times fees are set by default in many exchanges and wallets so the end user isn't always aware of it, and usually not the fiat value of the fee (since it's usually denominated in satoshi).
There could certainly be some spam in the mempool (especially at the free or nearly-free fee levels) but I think the fact that we see backlog even at the higher fees makes this unlikely I think.
Another source, fees are high lately due to multiple factors: 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:24:22
Define small blocks and how you arrived at 1mb as the best solution.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:07:52


Why do you assume all people who want lower fees are the same? A large contingent want segwit, others don't. BCH != Segwit2x. Please list the NYA signers who were part of BCH so we can see the overlap.


So.. you're going to join Segwit2x? It's pretty hilarious to me that "unity" means "join my side".

Interestingly, a professor at my alma mater received the nobel prize for her work on the commons and how some communities manage them effectively. It's some pretty interesting [reading](
Read some of the 8 principles. It's pretty thought provoking about how/if it would work with Bitcoin.

1) Pay for your popcorn with no fee
2) Vendor accepts your payment with 0conf
3) Transaction sits in the mempool forever
4) Keep doing this, buying stuff with 0conf
5) Later empty money out of wallet with fee
6) Profit
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:21:47
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:54:47
Agreed. Electrum is pretty good with its fee slider. I wish exchanges let you do the same.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:57:45
Agreed, good point Charlie. What are you using for Segwit metrics? I use the site below which is only showing 0.5% percent of transactions. But that could change quickly if exchanges pick it up.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:28:56
I agreed with everything until the last line. I recognize exciting things are being worked on, however they are not ready to be implemented and bitcoin usability is suffering right now.
High fees are a real issue and I don't think it's crazy to talk about short term solutions to tide us over until we have more segwit adoption and lightning available. I don't have a position on segwit2x, i'm just frustrated at the amount of group-think that prevents people from actually discussing the real issues.
The entire system is being hamstrung by high fees and your solution is ... "just keep waiting, lightning will be ready someday!"
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:10:18
Fees are dependent on the mempool. The 20th/21st was actually a great day to send low-fee transactions because the mempool was mostly cleared out. So you could get away with 7 satoshi/byte.
Move ahead a couple days to the 25th/26th and you're more likely to pay around 400 satoshi/byte to be included in the next block.
If you can time your transaction to be when blocks are fast, hashpower is high, and mempool is low, then by all means do it. Right now is actually a pretty good time to send low-fee tx for those reasons.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:20:25
I don't follow you. If segwit2x became more profitable than BCH they would mine it. They follow the most profitable version of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:08:41
1 &amp; 2 are pretty interesting, never thought about those specifically. I like  because a decentralized system should be harder to take down, however with bitcoin it may be a little hard to define. Even just a few computers in a garage could maintain the blockchain if 90% of the planet was destroyed. I think you'd have to wipe out every computer on the planet to disable bitcoin, but maybe i'm not thinking of anything.
2 also makes sense to me because decentralized should be more anonymized. I like that one because it also makes you think about implementation of bitcoin, like using a different address for every transaction which is a small thing that can help anonymity.
Not sure I follow  what's your thinking on that one? I feel like market cap is mostly driven by speculation and may only indirectly be linked with decentralization (as much as people value it and are willing to buy more because of it).

I don't think Wall Street is even in yet.. not in a big way. They will be once payments pick up with more Segwit adoption / lightning networks.

I'll be happy when lightning activates. Never said otherwise.
No, lightning won't be limited to one coin. We'll see many coins add lightning since it's open source.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:16:07
I see what you mean. Yeah it's an interesting game theory problem. It's one of those situations where none of the miners trust each other, so it leads to a possibly worse outcome (everyone rushing to mine the more profitable chain) than would occur if everyone collaborated (and mined the same chain). However, maybe that's a good thing because you really don't want miners collaborating.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:06:22
It's in the video. I'm not claiming to know if it's sincere, just pointing out a fact.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:05:13
It's possible. There's no way to be 100% sure but all the indicators are for low support of 2X.
Bitfinex should give us a good view of support, but that's only around 25%.

I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I wasn't saying it was correct because most people believe it. I was saying that I think you're misstating their argument. You said: "The argument is bitcoin can't handle increasing the size the blockchain grows whenever it needs to scale." That's a straw man, because I don't get the sense that the other side is arguing for bigger block sizes whenever it needs to scale. Therefore it wasn't "argumentum ad populum".
This is the problem with forums like this. You don't know me and you can't read it in the tone that I wrote it in. I'm not sure why such a sarcastic response was necessary, but I wasn't replying in that tone if that's how you read it.
For the record I have no position on 2x. I find it remarkable how efficient bitcoin is at the total level, with billions of dollars of volume moving per day and total fees of around .01-.02%. Average transaction fees per volume are very low, however median fees per volume are higher. I'm very receptive to the fact most developers don't want it, but I also believe businesses (and the millions of users they represent, many non-english speaking, non-reddit, non-twitter, and non-IRC users) deserve a voice too, and shouldn't be automatically painted as corporate shills. I'm hopeful segwit adoption rises quickly to relieve pressure on the network.
Instead of the sarcasm, why don't you just talk like a normal person? What is wrong with seeking information as I did?
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:32:22


You're striking at the very core of the disagreement between many people in bitcoin. Is it a store of value, or a payments system? Is it gold or the new VISA?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:19:36
I think you have to transfer the BTC, because each password (25th word) is like a different wallet.
As far as testing recovery, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but can't you recover a Trezor wallet in Electrum? Not saying you should, for security reasons (typing recovery seed in computer may compromise it).

In the future mobile devices, tablets, etc could have full nodes. Rejecting them as nodes because they lack full chain is rejecting a useful part of the community. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:45:25
You’re limiting nodes severely with that. Validating the chain for yourself is enough. Obviously nodes that connect with peers is great too.

Please provide a source that shows inching up the block size from 1mb to 2mb will harm decentralization.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:30:19
Respectfully, I disagree. I think most people fully recognize that bigger blocks are a temporary measure. Maybe Bitcoin Unlimited has a different vision, but I think people of the likes of Ver and the 2x consortium just want to keep fees a little lower *at the moment* so that we have more time to implement other technologies.
There's also the common-sense argument that technology will improve over time. 50 years from now, with cheaper and better storage, ram, and bandwidth we certainly wouldn't need a 1mb cap. So the question in my mind isn't if, but when is the appropriate time.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:13:38
Updating a major exchange is more complicated than updating a chrome extension for a hardware wallet. Coinbase hasn’t even implemented Bitcoin Cash, which was months ago. Doesn’t really seem like stalling to me (one can never be sure) but I imagine we’ll see segwit turned on after S2X fork. Remember, segwit isn’t even in the Core GUI yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:41:59
I didn’t mean it that way. I just meant it takes time to implement as evidenced by Core. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:12:04
Interesting sources. I looked at each one of them. Most don't deal with 2mb blocks (which I suppose would be ~4mb with segwit), but rather larger increases such as 8mb which was the discussion at the time.
The only sources that seemed relevant to me were the two from Patrick Strateman, about initial sync quadratic time complexity, and the miner block switching latency.
Pretty interesting topics. Would love to see an update based on recent improvements to Core around syncing time.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:12:11
Good point, thanks. Was there any communication / planning between Core and the major businesses leading up to activation on how to best do that, and what the businesses needed?

This post is stupid. 
Why do you think Roger keeps the Mt Gox video on his own channel? Why do you think he hasn’t deleted it?
Why don’t you post to his own follow up on the video? 
I certainly don’t agree with everything Roger says. But by his own admission he regrets making the statement and lost money himself in the exchange. And he apologized. He doesn’t try to rewrite history by deleting the video, even though that would be convenient.

I'd love to hear an anti-inflation advocate explain this too. Inflation is very good at encouraging consumer spending which basically runs the US economy.
When your money slowly devalues, you are motivated to "do something" with it, not just hodl. So you put it into a bank account to gain a little interest, you convert it to assets like real estate, or you invest it in the stock market.
Now imagine the opposite. Imagine that your money slowly appreciates in value without doing anything. Now you have less of an incentive to spend and invest this money. It's exactly the hodl mentality that we all know.
Consumer spending is about 70% of the US GDP. Essentially, we all pay each other's paychecks when we engage in the economy. If consumer spending were to decrease, even a couple percent, that would result in lost jobs and wages.
