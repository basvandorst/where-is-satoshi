I am oddly hoping for this, in order to try and buy in. It would be a real boon for many trying to buy in!

Premise: "Reason for suing company" = Withholding funds.
"Customer asks "WHY THE FUQ?! GIMMIE MY MONEY ITS NOT USD ITS CRYPTO!"
"Cuz, you know "Federal Law?"
"Fuck the fed! its crypto ima sue!!!! Like uganda knuckles i spit on you!"
Company: "good luck citing case-law that faults the Provider for following said FEDERAL LAW......" and no it wont be held for ever but agreed it is damned annoying.
It really is due to the laws for fiat currency.

I read somewhere or heard cause I cant remember which, and I think elon said it, that Nasa did have re-usability in mind back in those days but it was waaaaaaaaaay to expensive with existing tech of the era... building a new rocket was considered cheaper. The Shuttle System however, threw that argument out the window, but that was cuz I think, politically, the gov wanted it. Became the most expensive jobs program in history, 1 billion a launch for the most complicated machine created in history, with a shit-poor payload.... I loved the shuttle but in a world where its "money first" it was a waste. If it was a treky type world, the hell I think Nasa woulda improved on the design and launch system a long time ago if it wasnt for lack of funding.

this. politics over everything else. Nasa's funding was only due to competition with Russia's space program, and once they fell off the wagon, Nasa's funding was scaled back dramatically. Politics drove the space race and its sad that much of what you see today, probably would have been done by Nasa had they remained funded at Apollo levels. I do think tho Nasa's future will remain and be the primary scientific body in the future as well as deep space exploration.
