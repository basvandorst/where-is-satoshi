"Oh god, what is this happens in the US?!? I better sell everything now!! Wait, why is the price dropping? My sell limit orders keep moving off the top of book! I DON'T UNDERSTAND MARKETS!!"

That's...not what this is at all. See the other answers as well, but the CME BTC futures are derivatives. Options are also derivatives.

The whole point behind shorting is that you don't need to own the instrument. Instead of buy low sell high, you borrow and sell high, and buy back low. That's why you have margins.
Also, you can trade BTC futures on CBOE next week.

...and mine. I don't get it?

I was somehow able to sell half of my holdings at 18500, and buy almost all back in ~15700. Kept enough USD to have an awesome Christmas. That was a neato morning.

I don't think shorting instruments rising 20% in one day is advisable. Also, can't wait to see the margin requirements.

I love the comments here. Like earlier someone asked what a futures derivative was, and someone else replied with some calculus, like how to take the derivative of a function.

Have you tried kraken?

I work as a prop trading dev in Chicago near there...
We are sprinting for the 2nd week of Dec right now, I can tell you!

I'm confused. I thought you locked the price at the time of purchase on Coinbase? I bought $100 worth when it hit $5770, and the confirmation email says 0.0168 BTC will be transferred to my account by the 18th.

Bitcoin options == infinite volatility

I'm newish to this, can you explain more? "Read the faq, asshole!" is also a valid response, but I'm on mobile and getting my kids to bed.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:54:09
Right, but it's still locked to $5770. I don't pay  or whatever, which OP was implying afaik.

Thanks for the response. I've got a lot more reading to do (e.g. mempool)

Annnnd, heading back up.
