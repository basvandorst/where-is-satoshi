Which is why I'm hedging my bets on the other coins...I just can't see btc doing as well in the long term as some of the other coins out there
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:36:30
Absolutely,I don't doubt it...though I fear recovery will better some alts more than btc.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:24:09
With alt coins gaining, I really can't see that happening anymore. The up and coming alts have so much more going for them. Btc just has the early bird advantage.

Just came back from 6 months in Somalia....most poor people have smart phones mate....and they're big in crypto..though in Africa (Eastern Africa to be precise), BTC is no longer the top dog. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:49:16
too little too late imo. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:55:24
Yeah sure, I'm guessing you don't know too much about the alts then. And let's be honest, if you think big institutions haven't been buying up btc, your wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:13
I bloody hope so, I do think btc's reign is coming to an end because of all the issues (not a fan of bch either). 
There was a post recently allot btc being like aol...I it's really struck me...innovative tech and ideas will pop up whilst btc still struggles with issues it's always had...whilst btc has arguably the most money and biggest community atm, it's clear people are jumping ship. 
I don't wish for anyone to lose money (even bch holders)and I hope all of us new adopters reach our own moon but I think 2018 will be even more crazy than this year. I just hope regulation comes in soon, crypto needs it.

And yet it's the far East that are trading the volume. Wall street are big, but not big enough to massively impact a global market.

Wouldn't really be an ico
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:32:01
I hope I'm wrong, I've been holding since 2012, even did a bit of mining Quark coin (fml, what a shitcoin) and getting paid XRP for letting some app use my CPU to help in science research...sold both for btc soon after though. 
I only got into Alts properly 2 months ago with ETH and XRP again....This month I decided to diversifymy spread to 15 different coins. 74% on BTC still though. 
I've had a profitable few weeks, which scares the shit out of me since my initial investment was about £750, of which I've sold quite a few btc since then and now on a computer (3 years ago) and a phone for 0.5btc in July....it's easy to gamble with money I've not spent but I'm trying not let greed control me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:08:58
Could be a reason people are pumping into litecoin and ethereum at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:34
Forgot to mention, in uk based.
It's a good business opportunity that is love to start if I wasn't; in Somalia, in the army, or had the capital to start it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:07:29
Wait...I didn't...I didn't convince Korea to jump on to crypto....I only know a handful of Koreans and they're not in an influential position.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:12:59
I can cash out up to £44k before April and another after. I wouldn't sell all my holdings. 
I'm actually torn between just holding USDT until the storm settles...though i fear that might be a bigger risk than just holding the btc or look for a green coin on CMC during a sea of reds.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:20:06
I'm currently deployed in Somalia, have been talking about BTC since pre-deployment training in March...only this last week some of my colleagues decided to listen to me. 
I've had better luck speaking to UN workers...I've probably  got around 15 people to buy into bitcoin in the last 6 months. Some of these UN workers are on $16k a month and are seeing the $$$ in Crypto like never before. 
I spent a week in Kenya and turned an office of 8 people into buyers over the space of 2 days...their office looked like a trading floor by the time i left.  
I've found it really hard to give advice to people...Whilst I've made quite a lot of money this last few weeks specifically on  BTC,  LTC and XRP recently...all of it is profit as I jumped on BTC in 2012...so my daily gains have been great...telling someone to to risk throwing their £500 from BTC to Litecoin because of a pump is easy for me to do, but harder for someone that has worked hard for that £500  in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:03:21
I personally think people are spending now and the dip will come January...everyone's broke in Jan, they spent too much money, partied too hard and need cash....their bonuses will have been spent on crypto, gifts, parties and booze.....the can't get their money back from the booze and parties, but they can cash out in January to pay their rent. 
I'm going to be selling for fiat at the end of dec to wait until feb...I can't see it going up in Jan tbh....Maybe I'm wrong, i've got no facts or figures to back myself up...I just the new comers to crypto will bail if they see they've made a profit in jan and need to pay bills, or they bail if there's a 5-10% dip because they'll be scared and thus the snowball begins. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:52:07
It's why I think the crash will happen in January...I'm calling out at the end of the month and waiting for the storm to settle at the end of Jan to reinvest.

Good luck logging into Kraken every day...I know i fucking can't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:12:16
Both coins have had their moment. Other coins can do everything better than them. I can't see btc holding the top spot at the end of 2018....Both BCH and BTC are attaching each other whilst the future giants are growing up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:08:17
You're talking about new alts, I'm taking about ltc and xrp, both are far better than btc....they just weren't first.
Yes I know the history of ripple, before I'm lectured too...still doesn't stop it being a good coin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:18:12
Bitcoin might be just the thing we need to push for green energy.lots of little will want s skive if the pie and if they go green, it's free money.that's how I see it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:10
Bitcoin has made me more money than the money I've saved whilst currently serving in Somalia. Home next month with an end of tour bonus and it still won't be a scratch on what I've made from my btc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:17:36
Purse.io works with Amazon...do your research before using it though.
Bought my phone earlier this year for half a btc...even 20% off....sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:13:10
has loads of threads about it....bots must be broke because xrp barely moved, lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:17
If I were to choose to sell all my bitcoin's, I'd certainly want a crypto savvy financial advisor to tell me the best way to sell and sort the tax out for me. I'm a long term holder so I've no need at the moment but the time will come. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:15:33
Do you mean"why aren't...."
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:30:30
I lost faith in them weeks ago. Bittrex and binance has held up fine since then. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:16:30
That reply is getting really old, it's also why the alts are catching up. If we can't accept the cons of btc, then we'll go down with it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:26:43
Very true...like i said though, at the moment, with so many new people, people you never thought would be posting about it on facebook, all takes is a little snowball at this point and people will dump. That's my biggest concern atm. 
My Father-in-law bought 25BTC in Nov, dumped it on the dip we had on the 10th Dec (dropped to 13K, then bought again once it had risen a to 17.5k...Koreans and the Korean exchanges are having a huge impact on Crypto and they're terrified of dips...they're just in it for profit, not because they understand the tech. My father-in-law is in construction, he's not a techy kind of guy, but he and many of his friends are buying crypto now. 
A small snowball will have the Koreans running for the hills.

Tried it yesterday, lost $4000...never again.

The list is organised by volume owned.

It was more my mistakes than poor choices.

You know there's more than one timezone right?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:16:29
What's the best way to do this? What do I need to do the same, I'm tempting to it too. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:40
Come over to the alt side, where fees are minimal and much quicker. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:53:13
Fml...yeah fair point,I guess I just have to make a bunch of blockchain.info wallet accounts, store the keys myself but share them too and give them the login....not quite the same as a gift card though
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:11:15
Wait, is that a joke or is there more than btc gold?

Sadly i don't think we've seen the worst yet....America are still asleep and Europe is just waking up. There are going to be a lot of panic sellers in the coming hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:49
Going to cut my btc in half and invest more in the alts...sick of the drama and the fees. So many good alts out there that need time like btc has had. I'll still hodl btc but changing it from 75% holdings to about 35%. All my friends that have recently got into btc are rightly complaining about time and fees. I think the top spot is no longer safe for btc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:58:38
I was wrong, all is good
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:38:03
well i've got 6000 sitting quietly, lets hope for gains
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:53:01
right, I'm not massively following all the news. I've got a bunch of btc in my blockchain wallet online. Bought back in 2010. 
Am i right in thinking i should have the same amount in BCC if I empty my wallet and input the passphrase into a btc cash wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:45:32
Here's a question, what's stopping me putting my BTC in Bitthumb, selling, then buying more btc on a cheaper exchange? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:26:15
I spent 0.5BTC earlier this year for my Samsung S8....fml. I know it wasn't much compared to my total holdings, still feels bad man. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:35:35
Yeah my cousin is a trading broker, during the BP oil spill, he made a lot of money buying on the New York stock exchange and selling in London....since confidence in America was down but was normal business back in Europe.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:52:54
My Korean father-in-law recently got into crypto...he's blog tech savvy at all. all I know is that he bought 25Btc and invested in 10 other coins. I guess the Koreans are starting to get mainstream with it...Sadly he won't listen to me at all about keeping his coins off exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:22:34
Is it a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:47:18
It's funny because you wouldn't have bought a drink 3 months ago with bitcoin.
The fact it's only good as a store of value is it's strength and weakness.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:46:29
Yeah this would also make now sense of alt coins didn't exist..but they do and they're better.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:11:35
bitcoin has no direction or roadmap...I'd rather support a company that has goals. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:44:30
To be honest, that's how we (fans of all the crypto currencies) feel about this community. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:26:56
I guess people won't be donating bitcoin though.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:48:00
Another 4 years then.
