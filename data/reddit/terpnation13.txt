Joke's on bitfinex. I traded 36% of my account for BFX without any trade fees

Does this cut-off time apply for ETH as well?

Legitimate question: Is it not illegal to force trade 36 percent of my non-BTC assets for BFX tokens, an asset that literally did not exist when I deposited?

Zane, could you clarify if your edit should read:

What would happen if a trading position not funded by BTC, with a positive P/L before the hack suffers large losses or liquidation during the blackout. Will there be an option to close that position at its value as of 18:00 UTC?

I feel for everyone affected, I really do. However, in order to make bitcoin users who lost everything 64% whole would require trading 36% of my non-BTC assets for BTC without my permission at a price that I cannot set. And to top it all off, they are doing so while I cannot access or trade the remaining 64% of my account.

Your support team is waffling on this now, claiming 18:00 UTC as the cutoff time even though the actual hack time was around 09:00 Aug 2.  I just referenced this post in a response to them.  Is this now inaccurate?

Obviously it will be redeemed for BFXplus, a token backed by sticky-notes to be release June of wheneverthefuckwesayitwill

Thanks for keeping us all in the loop, Zane. Is there a reason not to just close all open margin positions as of their standing at 18:00 UTC yesterday?
