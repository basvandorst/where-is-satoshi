He's not an incumbent.  He's been in the private sector since 2003.

1. Indeed, he's been in the private sector since 2003.
2. The Speaker of the House determines committee assignments and has guaranteed Barr that he may return to his previous committees if re-elected (eg. Financial Services, Oversight, Judiciary).
3. Barr's track record is that he's always defended the Constitution, even when other leading Republicans stray.

He's been consistently the frontrunner in the polls, and it's made up of a large part of his former district.  I respectfully doubt your odds making on this one.

Looks like you proved that some National Review editors weren't Barr fans last September.  There's quite a lot more written in many other publications over the last year.  
More appropriately, though, the post was about support for Bitcoin.  Given that one of the two candidates WILL be in Congress come January 3 ... BARR is by far the Candidate most likely and most able to help and support Bitcoin in Congress.

The Primary election is Tuesday, May 20 and the runoff will be on July 22.  There is no Democrat challenger, so the republican candidate will definitely go to Congress.  Bob Barr has the name id to win and a record he can run on.  There are other candidates in the race that appeal to some of the groups you mentioned, but since there are 6 candidates, it has marginalized a lot of the hyperbole.  He'll definitely make the run-off and looks good in a toe to toe match-up against any of the other contenders.  My Bitcoin's on Barr!
