Well, if they have a large amount invested it would be smart to take out enough to fill a tax bracket for 2017 to save room for 2018s tax year and keep themselves in a lower certain tax bracket they want without being taxed in a higher bracket.

If Bitcoin (the most popular and well known crypto) goes down, they all go down in fear that the crypto idea is losing momentem. Basically fear.

Listen to it. I've made some big mistakes the past few days ignoring my gut. I'm sceptical as well and sticking to it.

I was playing the market for a bit and it has been very stable for about all day. I had just put a buy up and was about to step away when I saw some whale put up a 250 sell order and I had headlights in my face. Cancled the order about $40 from my price to watch the train fly by lol. Down we go! What a rush.
