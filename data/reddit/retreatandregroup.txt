That would be true only if the market was frictionless. The fact that most people were not technically savvy enough to buy bitcoin in the past and this barrier slowly lowering is one of the drivers of the price.
Consider concert tickets. Scalpers wouldn't be able to stay in business if something that costs x today can't be worth 10 times x later on.

Not to mention, even if they swear up and down that they won't blame you if they lose money, they still do in the end... And not only that, but they won't admit it, and would rather the relationship grow cold than to admit to themselves that they were to blame for their own fuckup.

Interesting that this happened a few days after futures went live. Seems like wallstreet might have been waiting to buy some calls before dumping after its pump.

An Amazon gift card can be voided. A BTC wallet hooked up to the lightening network cannot.

Why aren't we all hurting the same? We all had the opportunity to mine enough bitcoins on our laptops in 2011 to be billionaires today.

I'm not technical analysis genius, but take a look at the post I did in February: 
If you look particularly close to right before the big runup, there is the word "Media attention". That's when bitcoin will go up in value again, as soon as the media piles into it. Right now it's old news, therefore I'd wait a year or 2 for the media to forget and rediscover it again.

Then when you left they all plotted how they could kidnap you and force you to reveal your brain wallet key

Yea, but "Fear Of Missing Out" can change to "Fear Of Being Left Holding The Bag" pretty quickly. 
I don't see any new ideas on the Bitcoin Cash side, besides trying to evermore increase the block size, which eventually won't work anymore. As soon as the hype dies down, they won't have anything that makes them special over any other alt coin. 
I still own BCH which I got from the fork, however. I must admit I was completely wrong about ETC, too, which I didn't think would survive, which is why I'm reluctant to sell.

Yea but what does that mean when a majority haven't even touched theirs? It's mostly all weak hands that will eventually sell when it becomes worth it to do so.

Good news, I think we hit "Despair" (not to tute my own horn or anything but this is my own post): [

If you don't like the price, just wait ten minutes.

Sounds like a money making opportunity.

It doesn't take *most* altcoins having value to overtake bitcoin. Only one.

Someone should tell google that. bitcoin.com third item on the front page for me, when I lookup "bitcoin"

I never bought bitcoin to make money, only for the ride. It's been very exciting, and in that way I feel like I've already owned a Lambo (and crashed it...)
