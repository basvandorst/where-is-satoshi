I've been doing some research on Bitcoin cold storage and I realized that I may have something to offer. Please let me know if you have questions or suggestions to improve my process.

I created three versions of a one-piece stencil, in adobe illustrator, for anyone who's interested. The files are saved in .ai format version CS2. 
The first file is a lo-res .jpg and the second file is the actual vector file. 
I'm off to work now but I'm going to make another one with the text "Perpetuate the phenomena!" attached to it.

I also like coinbase, if only for their ease-of-use. 
To add to your idea, governments can charge an income/capitol gains tax on the coinbase 'priority fee' for working in both Bitcoin and legal tender(i.e. Place our local currency here), satiating the 'need to regulate'. Let the governments manage their currency and allow the Bitcoin network to manage its currency.

I just added some more stencil/banner files to the 
[Bitcoin Stencils!]( album I created.

To answer your questions.
1. It is a wood resin used for exterior, architectural paneling. The one I have pictured has a shiny, silver color laminated on it. You can read more about the actual product at [trespa.info](
2. I will post more pics of colors that I currently have in stock early next week.
3. My stock is currently limited to small samples that I haven't had a chance to organize, yet. I will list the color options next week as well.
4. There is no place on the panel to write and I don't think a pen will even write on the surface. You can use a post-it note or... I use an app on my iPhone (called Baseline) that allows me to view balances of any address.
5. My name is Matthew Amey. I am an artist from the eastern shore of Maryland but my studio is in Delaware. I can be reached via my website [matthewamey.com]( or [independenttattoo.com]( My studio address is 36666 Bluewater Run W. Unit 3, Selbyville, Delaware 19975.
Thanks for taking the time to ask...

I will. Thanks!

I just added some dotted lines to the files to help make sense of them.
Thanks for the feedback.

It should work just fine for laser. I've used a few lasers and the .ai CS2 format works well. If you need it in a different format just let me know. I can covert it to virtually any format.
Please post pics if you make it happen. Thanks.

Pricing is mostly labor but the Trespa is also a very expensive material.

I've considered the comments on here and I've made a few changes. Firstly, I have created the username [since that is my real name. I will post through that username from now on. Also, I've reduced the price to reflect my hopes that BTC will continue to hold its value. Thanks for the feedback.

There was a request for some stencils to help promote the use of Bitcoins so I put some together. Share the love...

The line over the text makes it possible to print these out, cut out the white parts and use them as stencils. Otherwise, the inside of the 'b' and the 'o' would fall out. I will update the files with some directions.
