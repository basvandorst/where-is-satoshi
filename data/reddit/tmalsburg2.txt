No direct control, but indirect control, yes.  They can decide not to include transactions with low fees.  Isn't that what's happening?

Technically you're not buying BTC but exchanging USD for BTC.  You can still buy as much stuff as before but with a different currency.  So it's not a matter of being able to afford it.  We have to face the facts: average people are not interested in acquiring BTC because at the moment it has no benefit for them.

Orders are to some extent a random (because they are not centrally controlled).  Getting such a clean linear pattern by chance is therefore fairly unlikely.  The pattern on Kraken is less pronounced but even if it was the same, the explanation could be that the same kind of manipulation is happening there as well.
**Edit:** the Kraken plot actually supports the idea of order book manipulation because there are so many orders of the same amount (200).  Why would one person open orders with such a pattern?  If it's not one person, why do all these orders have the same amount?
**Edit2:** Also compare to [Bitstamp]( where we see no such pattern and overall much less demand.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:02:21


Why? Because more transactions will go into one block?  This analysis seems a bit too simple because the more people use Bitcoin, the higher the value of BTC and the higher the incentive for mining and wasting electricity. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:03:25
Manipulation in the sense that I'm talking about: You submit buy orders without having the actual intention of buying.  If the price approaches the value at which your order triggers, you retract the order.  It is very easy to implement this with a bot.  The goal is to create the illusion of high demand which influences other traders decisions.

If the chip is included only to circumvent regulations, this won't fly.  Regulations can be changed and they are very much in flux at the moment.  Also, I'm not even sure if sending BTC actually makes you a money transmitter as OP says.
@_date: 2015-09-27 05:06:42


You didn't think this through.  Effectively 21 would be  sending people BTC, because your little chip is extremely unlikely to ever find a block.  So if you have BTC on your device that's simply because 21 has sent you BTC (a share of the income of their mining pool).  In other words, the chip *does not* solve the regulatory nightmare that you are talking about.

Laptops, phones, and tablets are the least suitable platforms for mining because they all run on batteries and they are not designed to deal with the waste heat.  Also, what prevents companies like Visa Inc. or Paypal to offer a service that achieves the same in software?  Even less friction because we already have credit cards and Paypal accounts!  Moreover, the amounts that you will be able to mine with this are so small that you won't be able to achieve anything meaningful.

If there is a strict limit on the growth of the blockchain, mainstream adoption will break the network.  The maximum block size will have to be increased.


The blockchain's growth seems exponential, too: 
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:52:13
Exactly, the size of the blockchain already means that the network cannot anymore operate as it was originally supposed to.  Running a full node on your laptop will soon be impossible.  Good bye decentralization.  If bitcoin would be adopted by the main stream, the blockchain would explode and probably grow much faster than the capacity of data storage and computational power.  In response to that, people often refer to off-chain transactions as a solution but if bitcoin needs crutches like that, is it really that great?
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:20:12
You are not guaranteed to find a nonce generating the required run of zeros in the hash of a block in a fixed amount of time.  Sometimes you are lucky and find one quickly, sometimes you have to try many nonces.  So there's naturally some random variation in the time it takes to finish a block.  On blockchain.info, you can see that it sometimes takes a lot of time to generate a new bock and sometimes it takes just a minute.  The difficulty of generating a new block is periodically adjusted such that the average time it takes to generate a block is 10 minutes.

The curves only look similar when you mess with the time-axis.  The buildup in Bitcoin happened over the course of days whereas the buildup during the dotcom bubble happened over the course of years. Let's assume that the two curves will continue to develop similarly.  Since the time-scale of the process is much smaller in bitcoins, the baisse will be over soon.

I was going to recommend "International Exchange Bank" but that name is already taken.  Nevertheless, I'm going to explain my rationale for that idea:
* For many potential customers it would be the first time they open an account abroad.  To me it's a somewhat strange idea to open an account on the other side of the globe in a country about which I don't know much besides that you have this canal.  Having "international" in the name lowers the psychological barrier.
* "Exchange" is an important keyword for the bitcoin community but it's not so specific to bitcoin that it would alienate other potential clients who may not be interested in bitcoin or digital currencies in general.  I guess, your bank may offer benefits for other types of clients as well, so you shouldn't limit yourself needlessly to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-05-09 07:34:48
* The bank might want to add other digital currencies later.
* It's not clear if bitcoins are here to stay. It's still an experiment.

Sorry for saying it's just a prank.  I see that you're trying to seriously contribute something.  I'm not a grammar nazi and it's in fact the first time in my six years on Reddit that I comment on somebody's spelling.  But I think poor spelling can undermine your credibility, whether you are a teenager or banker.  *Cypress* was just one example of many.  For example, you often write common nouns and adverbs with capital letters.  Another thing that made me suspicious was that your knowledge consists of the kind of things that you can pick up in bitcoin-related forums.  But as soon as you leave that realm, you say some very questionable things like that the EU is not a safe place for banks.  This is obvious nonsense.  After all, London, one of the financial capitals of the world, is in the EU as well.  There are many cases where people on Reddit claimed to be someone they aren't.  So it's always good to be a little suspicious.

He uses technical terms like "host", "protocol", "nodes in the p2p network" that many people may not be familiar with.  Also he goes into details like double spending and transaction fees before having explained the basics.  Knowing that digital signatures are cryptographically strong is not helpful if you don't know what a digital signature actually does.  The analogy to real signatures is slightly misleading because digital signatures do much more than signatures on paper.  While it's certainly nice to have this video, it's more suited for geeks than for average people, and for geeks there's already a lot of material on the web explaining bitcoins.

The key here is "*can* be easier...  to memorize." There is not an easy passphrase for every randomly generated key.  The number of passphrases of a length that can be remembered is very limited and that's precisely the reason why we can remember them (the brain exploits the redundancy in passphrases).  Since the number of easy passphrases is limited it's easier for an attacker to search that space than to search the space of randomly generated keys.  Our brains cannot defeat information theory.
Edit: By *easy passphrase* I mean a passphrase that can be remembered.  It may still be long and fulfill the criteria for good passphrases.
Edit2: Clarity.

Well that is a very indirect attack on the problem of centralization then.  Hasn't anybody considered to devise a p2p exchange system (perhaps using a variant of the bitcoin protocol)?  Not sure how feasible it is, but that would address the problem of centralization in a much more direct and thorough way.  After all, exchange institutions are still a big wart on the beautiful bitcoin system because they require precisely the kind of trust that bitcoin wanted to get rid of.
Apart from that, I'm not sure if the trading engine is the critical barrier for new exchanges.  Legal issues and the handling of fiat sound more intimidating to me.  But sure having a reliable and efficient open source engine won't hurt.

You are of course right, that there is a sentence for each private key.  However, most of these sentences would be way too long to be remembered.  There's a lot of information in a private key (that's why it's secure) and human brains are awful at storing data.  That's why we take notes.  Using passphrases makes it easier for our brains to store a small number of bits but the number of rememberable passphrases is still much smaller than the number of possible private keys.  The number of private keys that you can represent with 256 bits is many orders or magnitude larger than the number of all sentences that have ever been uttered in the history of mankind. Even worse: the estimated number atoms in the universe is 10^80 and the number of possible private keys is 10^77.  Ok, there are many possible private keys, but you will say that we can also remember fairly long sentences.  Let's assume that the average person knows 50000 words.  Then you would need passphrases of about 17 words to represent all possible private keys.  Doesn't sound impossible but virtually all of these passphrases are totally random sequences of words, they are not meaningful sentences, not even remotely, and therefore extremely hard to remember.  If you introduce the constraint, that passphrases should have at least some kind of meaning, the number of 17-word sequences that you can actually use (i.e. remember) is very small.  In order to make up for that you would need even more words.  The problem is that sentences contain very little information.  One reason for that is that words are not uniformly distributed: some words occur all them time (the, a, in, ...) while most words occur almost never. Hence, there's very little entropy in sentences.  The rules of grammar make the problem much worse because they constrain the admissable sequences of words considerably.  For example, after the word "the" you will almost always see a noun (e.g. "man") and sometimes a adjective ("tall") but many words you will never see following "the."
Well, this is getting too long.
Edit: How long is the sequence of words generated by Electrum and how large is the dictionary?

From a user perspective I'm not sure how this would work.  Perhaps you could explain it.  For example, if I'd like to buy BTC, it seems there would be two options: either I could use the exchange service of your bank or I could use another exchange that has an account at your bank.  Right?  When I buy BTC from your bank, would I get BTC from the bank, or would the bank only match buy and sell orders of account holders?  Likewise the other direction; how does it work when I want to sell BTC.  Does your bank buy them or does it just match my sell order with a buy order by another customer.  I guess, a part of my question is whether your bank would only provide more safety and convenience to the customer or if it would also introduce serious market making as Keiser demands it.

The approach using ripple [described here]( sounds interesting.  However, it seems that whether a transaction will work or not is determined by the weakest link between the seller and the buyer.  That's a property that you don't want to have in such a system.  Mainly because it doesn't scale to larger amounts and to transactions where the two parties are connected through longer chains of nodes.  In both cases the probability that the weakest link is too weak will be too large to keep the risk at a reasonable level.  Also transferring money across several bank accounts will result in long processing times and considerable fees.

As long as the exchanges are as unreliable as they are right now, nothing major will happen I believe.  And since the legal situation is pretty unclear in most, if not all, countries, exchanges will continue to be unreliable for quite a while.

All these political arguments are a great way to hurt bitcoin.  I think these people are not doing bitcoin a favour because they portrait bitcoin as a weapon used to further a political agenda.  If you want bitcoin to succeed, you shouldn't needlessly make enemies.  Instead everybody should see a possibility to benefit from bitcoin.  If that includes banks, I don't have a problem with that.
Edit: Responses instead of downvotes would be great.

Well, yeah, the Economist.  They passionately hate the Euro and predicted its collapse many times.  The Euro just doesn't fit their worldview. Two years ago, they also predicted that the Greek Euro exit would be unavoidable and imminent.  However, neither did the Euro collapse nor did Greece exit the eurozone.  Sure, the last years were turbulent but don't forget that the whole mess wasn't started in Europe but in the US when the subprime mortage thing blew up.
I don't know which countries you meant when you referred to eastern Europe but I doubt that countries like Romania and Bulgaria which are firmly under the control of organized crime are safer places for starting a financial business than London, Frankfurt, or Zürich.  So far, I didn't hear of any banks that are planning to move their headquarters from London to Sofia or Bucharest.
Anyway, have a nice Sunday!

Of course I'm talking about his opinion on bitcoin.  We're in and his opinion on bitcoin is the sole reason why his statements about the Internet are brought up here.  It's obvious that Krugman's understanding of the bitcoin system is incomplete.  (He has that in common with most people in this subreddit.)  Nevertheless, he has a valid point: the value of bitcoin is not trivially clear and there's no lower bound on bitcoin's value as there is for gold.  To name just one problem: the altcoin inflation (increasing number of altcoints with substantial maket cap) has the potential to be disastrous for the value of bitcoin.  Bitcoiners usually respond to that by referring to the network effect but if the short history of the Internet teaches us one thing, it's that we shouldn't trust the network effect, see Myspace et al.

From what I gathered on  yesterday night, Paul is planning a reference implementation that is supposed to demonstrate the architecture.  High-performance doesn't seem to be a priority at this stage.   Of course, when you take current exchanges as a reference, anything is high-performance.


Could you please explain how buttercoin will facilitate a less centralized market?  It's apparently designed as monolithic trade engine similar to LMAX.  What's decentralized about that?

p2p is usually used to refer to direct transactions between the peers that are not mediated by a central instance.  Otherwise every form of transaction could be called p2p.

Couldn't they filter internet connections to see if people are using the bitcoin protocol?  Even if communication is encrypted, I guess there are still typical signatures of the protocol that could reveal or at least hint at what you're doing (e.g. average rate and size of packages, ports used, peer discovery, etc.).  Also, couldn't they infiltrate the network with fake clients just like it's done with bittorrent?  Collect IP addresses, get ID from provider, knock on your door.  Happens in Germany all the time.

They are fuzzed but this doesn't mean they are meaningless.  They just add a little bit of noise to them.  Btw, there is always noise in measurements and nevertheless the world didn't stop measuring things.  I agree, though, that there are much better ways to conduct a poll.

Europe consists of many very different countries.  Therefore, a general statement such as *Europe is (or is not) safe for banks* is too much of a simplification to make sense. Sure, being a bank in Cyprus is not funny right now but Cyprus has just [0.1% of the GDP of the EU]( (only Malta is smaller).  The UK (100 times the GDP of Cyprus) does everything to make London a banking paradise and they are spectacularly successful.

Sure, if you're happy with bitcoin staying a niche product for customers of Silk Road and similar markets, that's probably an option.  I got excited about bitcoin because I thought that it has more potential.

Right.  Computers have not been designed to store large amounts of money.  If common bitcoin software does it anyway, that's a problem with bitcoin not with computers.

In the context of the discussion (opening a bitcoin bank in Europe) London would have been a perfect candidate.  So your semantic contortions provide no way out.
Also, you obviously don't know what you're talking about: the EU is not the same as the Euro zone.  Many EU countries don't use the Euro, not just the UK.  They are: United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Czech Rep., Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Sweden.
Besides, what's your evidence for the claim that the EU is a bad place for banks?

One reason why this questions is difficult to answer is that nobody knows what the value of the USD will be in 20 years.  So even if we could make a good projection for the development of bitcoins, which we can't, we could still not answer your question.

There is not just "a spelling error" but hundreds that you apparently didn't notice.  And it's of course relevant because when an experienced banker tells us that Panama is a good place to open a bitcoin bank that's something entirely different than when a teenager says that.

I agree with the analysis but as long as the price of BTC is changing as wildly as it did over the last months such efforts are a waste of time and potentially damaging.  If the price of BTC goes down to $10 or up to $1000 over the next few months, are we going to start this debate all over again?  Changing the standard unit has the potential to confuse potential users quite a bit (recently I saw people bidding &gt;$100 for one Satoshi on Ebay showing that it's already confusing enough for some new users).  Therefore it should only be done if there is a long-term benefit.

And precisely that is not reflected in the article.  The article only reports the negative opinions.  Call it what you want but it's certainly not the kind of balanced journalism that I expect from this newspaper.

No, in principle such a p2p system could match sellers and buyers and they could meet in person to exchange bitcoins and $.  No banks involved.  In practice, you would want to transfer money to a bank account but there's no need for that.  I was thinking of a p2p alternative to localbitcoins.com.  Even if you transfer money via banks, this p2p scheme would be much more resilient against government interference.  A government can shut down an exchange but it can't easily control bank transfers from one random person to another.  Of course in this scheme, you'd have to trust random strangers (sending them money) but this can perhaps be dealt with using a [web of trust]( and some kind of reputation score (e.g. the probability that transactions with a person finish successfully).

Ok, I don't have specific features that I'd like to propose but I can tell you what questions would come to my mind when considering to open an account at your bank.  You could say the feature that I'd want is not having to worry about these points.
1. In what currency would my funds be stored at your bank?  In whatever currency I prefer or in USD?  The latter would force me to make bets not only on the price of BTC but also on the price of USD.
1. What are the fees for transferring money to Panama from the EU?
1. Are there any government restrictions in my country for transferring larger amounts to foreign accounts?
1. If I make profits from some lucky gambles on the price of BTC, when would I have to pay taxes?  When I convert BTC to fiat or when I transfer the profits to an account in my country.
1. And finally the most important question: how safe is my money in Panama?  My concern is that if something happens to your bank, my possibilities to get my money back would be very limited.  Generally, I can't assess what it means to store funds in Panama.  Is Panama politically stable?  Is organized crime a thread for banks there?  What's the potential of interference from the US government?  For me there are just a few unknowns too much in the equation to feel comfortable.  Blame it on my ignorance if you want.  I guess, I would feel much safer, if I could deal with a bank in the EU.  The funny thing is, I would feel safer precisely because of the regulations that you dread.
I don't want to be destructive, just point out some concerns that a potential customer might have.  Perhaps there are good responses to these questions that would convince me that I should do business with that bank in Panama.

The largest part of the population hasn't even heard about bitcoin.  Therefore, I'm afraid, there's hardly going to be a revolution because of bitcoin.  And the last revolution in France was in 1848.  So I guess the French may be a bit out of practice.

Could somebody please explain this in more detail?  Preferably somebody who's from France and speaks French?  This could be an important precedent for other Governments and therefore the BTC community should not just shrug it off.  The rebels in the community may even like this but such laws (if OP's summary is actually correct) could kill all those new businesses that are currently emerging and without them BTCs are pretty useless for most of us.
Edit: So far bitcoin was apparently pretty much under the radar of most governments.  But this may change quickly after all the recent media exposure.  It may be time to start some seriously lobbying for bitcoin (or to start a revolution if you're more inclined to this type of solution -- good luck with that).
