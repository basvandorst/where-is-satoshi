~~Race condition, isn't it? These bugs are really prevalent on BitCoin websites.~~ [Nope, explained here]( 


This unfortunately is not how bug bounties work. I have had a couple bugs with exactly the same consequences, and was always paid a "high" severity reward, but never higher. I understand your frustration, because I felt the same - using this kind of bug you could clear the company's wallet and never be seen again, yet you are paid a "high" $5000 reward for doing the right thing. I have accepted this as it is. 
The intention of bug bounty program is not to match the price of an exploit on the black market, or match what you could have stolen, it is an AWARD for you going the whitehat way and reporting it. The advantage of reporting through bounty program is that you will (*probably*) not get sued, and will receive your reward, while exploiting or selling the bug brings the obvious risks. 
[Here is a comment]( by the grugq about bounty amounts, and why they sometimes are not as high as you would expect for such a vulnerability. 
All this being said, Coinbase did make a mistake banning you and closing the second report, and I hope it will get fixed and your bounty paid.
