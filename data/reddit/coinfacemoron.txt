Try to look less like a bot.

Historically, it's actually a little less than 10 minutes. The hashrate has been increasing in most epochs, meaning blocks were produced faster than the target number of blocks per epoch (10 min / block). In the future if hash rate tops out, we can expect the real average to approach 10 min / block, but while the hashrate continues to increase, it can sometimes be a little faster.

I think the answer is a bit more complicated. This is my take, but I could be misunderstood.
In the case of lightning, open channels will just pass around commitment transactions that are not broadcast to the main chain until the channel is supposed to settle (close). If a hard fork occurs on the network before settlement, you also need to consider if the hard fork does implements replay protection. If it does, then previous commitments txs are valid on both chains, and could be broadcast on both (which is messy), and also the fork may not be monitored properly for broadcasting previous state (trying to steal), so it may be wise to close the fork channel. 
If the hard fork does implement reply protection, the original channel could remain open on the original fork and transactions in the lightning channel would continue to be valid. On the forked chain, previous commitment transactions would now be invalid, and the channel would have to close and reopen.

Peter was talking to Hal in 2001 - when we was only 16!

I would add Peter Todd in the mix :)

But to close a channel you need to relay a transaction on the network. I don't think the lightning software would do this on both forks. You would need to close one of the channels manually, right?

Agreed. I just don't know if the currently lightning software could handle that case seamlessly. I believe it would only support valid transactions on one of the forks, right?
