also, if you're in pretty high income brackets and looking for ways to increase your tax deductions, isn't having outstanding loans something that can help you reduce the taxes you pay?
sorry i forgot the exact specifications, but it seemed interesting and a little relevant that people would purposefully keep loans so that they can get better tax deductions haha.

bitcoin’s availability to be used as payment has been on a downward trend the last 3 years

while it is true that there is no guarantee bitcoin will rise in the future, i wouldn’t liken this to gambler’s fallacy.
in casinos, there’s always a house edge. over enough permutations, the player is almost 100% guaranteed to lose.
with bitcoin or any other asset in general really, there is no 100% guaranteed loss.

yes actually you can. you can do the inverse of exactly what small traders are doing. brokerages like robinhood that cater to small accounts are the perfect model for selling this exact data.
whether you believe it is an effective strategy or not is up to debate i guess, but still, this is always interesting to point out.

damn why would anyone ever hire investment firms or put their money in SPY when they could just buy BTC and have a 78% chance of a 38% gain  ^^/s
