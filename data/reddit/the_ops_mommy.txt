Also, as one matures, one does tend to develop a longer-term perspective (thinking about the year 2020 rather than January 17, 2018; looking at daily/weekly charts instead of focusing on what the 5min candles are doing)

I imagine they’d feel pretty shitty looking back at all the dozens if not hundreds of BTC they gambled away on stupid dice games, changetips, and/or unloaded when the price first reached $100.

I think was likely meaning to type *volume of trade* rather than market cap. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:18:55
Yes. Just use maths  
   (Amount / Price(start)) × Price(end) - Amount
     ($100/$14,400) × $17,000 - $100 = $18.06

That’s just the nature of finance.  
If you ever find yourself getting rich while simulataneously feeling a little unsettled by the nagging doubt that you don’t fully understand precisely *why* — then you’re doing it right..

Except he didn’t because this story is total bullshit, obviously.  
The chance of someone making a typographic error while sending coin and having it be a valid B₅₈ address/hash belonging to someone who hurr durr just happens to be reading the same Subreddit lmfao - c’mon people - this would have ≪ 1 in 1.0×10¹⁵⁷   odds of occurring at any point during the entire history of the Milky Way galaxy.

LOL I hope that person who was super psyched that they “now have $83 in bitcoin!” didn’t sell their 356 coins.  
Seeing as how that would now be 4⅕ million dollars...

If they were legitimately trolling with an inside reference type of deal, they would have probably mentioned Bitcoinica or even Mt. Gox, but Cryptsy just leads me to believe they were reading some super outdated shit archived on the bitcoin wiki.

Hahaha! Well, tbf that one at least confers bragging rights. Every party that guy attends from now to eternity, he gets to legitimately tell chicks that yess, he’s the guy who once ordered $100,000,000.00 dollars worth of pizza.

I believe it will hit 6 figures by the end of 2018.  
I think many people take a look at the exponential growth that’s occurring and dismiss it as a “speculative bubble” (e.g., “Tulip Mania”, etc) but in reality I think what we’re actually witnessing is a rather uniquely *pure* form of the [Network Effect]( playing out over the course of months/years. 
The uniqueness of the Bitcoin phenomenon is due to this underlying attribute that it has - that compared to the preexisting technology currently in use, BTC is literally futuristic. ‘Futuristic’ in the sense that if someone were to sit down today and devise a protocol for a transactional digital currency that embodies the ideals and modalities of the Internet Age - it would look a hell of a lot like bitcoin. 
This notion was a novelty in 2009. A curiosity that could be appreciated by plugged-in, intellectual, geeky types. As more and more time passes, the currency gains exposure (i.e. CNBC reporting on its price at least daily now; something which will only increase when the futures come into play and the Chicago crowd starts getting involved and taking a hard look at the underlying asset).  
More exposure + passing time, something begins ringing more and more true about Bitcoin’s *raison d’être*.  
People begin to think, “wait a minute, it’s *2017* - why the hell does it cost me $30 and a ½ hour of red tape to send a freaking wire transfer?” or “why is it this difficult to send my own money to my own accounts at different banks?”  
A digital currency very much *is* the next logical step.  
It’s *going* to happen. 
It may be Bitcoin that ultimately fills that niche, then again there’s at least an equal chance that it may not be.  
Similar to how we don’t conduct face-to-face transactions using gold doubloons nowadays. 
So in terms of ultimate utility, it’s certainly a speculative bet. 
But then again, when was the last time the average person even had the opportunity to speculate on something as ubiquitous and profound as the future medium of exchange for an entire global society?  
It almost sounds like it could be worth getting in on something like that sooner rather than later eh?  
And so it goes, as more and more people submit buy orders - for reasons ranging from cerebral to ~~greedy~~ ‘aesthetic’ (some people may just really like exponential curves plotted on graphs with large ordinate values :)  
Needless to say, all of these people will be mentioning their acquisition and subsequent hodling of said coins to at least one other human being, etc.  
So yeah that’s my humble analysis: the Network Effect: the same thing that’s gotten us to $11,000 - will get us to $110,000.

Bro since you sound like you got a touch of the autism, maybe put it to good use and go learn about futures trading? Oh or better yet! 
 a single shred of evidence for your false beliefs (which, being wrong, you won't be able to do).*  
Then, once you've realized you fucked up, you can maybe put on your big-boy pants and come back and apologize.

He's talking about an oscillator used in technical analysis (Relative Strength Index) 
Which without getting overly technical (excuse the pun) is simply a way of measuring the relative movement of an asset.  
You take the ratio of the upward price momentum over downward price momentum considered over a certain period, `N` (e.g. "1 week")   
         up(N)
    τ = ——————
        down(N)  
And then convert that to the index form, giving a range running from 0-100:  
    RSI(N) = 100-100/(1+τ)
The extremes are supposed to indicate when a commodity or a security is 'overbought' or 'oversold' etc

Quite the contrary friend. You literally have fuck-all of a clue what you're talking about-

Apology accepted.

LOL no, that is not how futures work, bud.
The BTC contract is end-of-day cash settlement. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:23:41
Good God man, do you even think about what you're writing?  


No coins *don't* have to be held - but the **cash** sure does.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:07:18
That's *exactly* what I'm saying.  
BTC futures are a *derivative* contract technically the same as cash-settled equity indicies. 
The long and short of it is that *yes* - one can absolutely short futures that they don't already own.  
The only thing restraining them is position limit sizes (max contracts a trader can buy/sell) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:26:20
Did you read the part about position limits...
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:59:57


I've traded futures at the Merc for years.  
Once the contact gets listed, shorting bitcoin is as simple as pressing a button on my X-Trader DOM putting in an offer for 1-n contracts.  
If right then the spot price is $9720.00 the contact price on the futures would be say, $48,600. 
Say I get 1 contract of mine lifted  
Now say 40 min later the spot price drifts down to $9680.00, the futures price (assuming it tracked identically) would be around 48'4
If I have a limit buy at that price that gets hit, then boom, I've shorted BTC for a quick $200 profit. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:42:33
Exactly and the traders already see that. 
They will have ridden the elevator from 5k to 12.5k so they'll cash out their coins at 12.5k and short the futures down to 3.5k, then buy buy buy more BTC and go long the futures for the ride up to 20k. 
It will be brief. And it will be bloody. And the people who see the play, will emerge 20x richer..

Ok I’ve got some intel on this.  
Both addresses in question belong to the same person.
It’s an Australian lad who (while I won’t dox his IRL identity) online uses the nym “pondsea”.
He is very involved with [KOMODO]( (a fork of Zcash) as well as the intimately related, soon-to-launch, “decentralized atomic swaps exchange” (smh) called [barterDEX]( (formerly known as [“Bitcoin Dark”] ( He **currently operates several KOMODO notary nodes** from servers in St. Petersburg, Russia, Montreal Canada, and Sydney Australia. 
(Remember the highlighted part for what follows)  
Last year and prior this same issue came up. 
The way their Komodo “blockchain solutions provider” system thingy works is by encoding tx details of their originating chain in the OP_RETURN output on the BTC blockchain. 
These “notary nodes” are performing something that they call “Delayed Proof of Work”. These “notaries” are compensated for performing these tasks.  
Their official response (by way of [a thread on bitcointalk]( attempted an explanation of their MO:

We took the liberty of phoning up Marea’s and cancelling your dinner reservations. We have instead made reservations for you at **Scandals: Bottomless Strip-Club Bar &amp; Grill** on US Highway 1 and Carlton Ave in lovely, Jersey City, NJ. Enjoy your evening!  


Reminder from the Reddit staff: 
For safety, we advise you to not store valuables in your car during dinner. Also, please consider the ingestion of some high-dose oral antibiotics at least 6 hours before dining. It’s not an accident that they included the word “penis” in Penicillin \*winky face\*  


*****

Hm. Well … on the bright side they also included a coupon for a free order of mozzarella sticks..  
Typically, I’d prefer my waitress to be wearing some form of pants … but whatever, I’ll live. Thanks Reddit.
