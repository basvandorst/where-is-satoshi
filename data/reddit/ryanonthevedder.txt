Cohn leaving will only serve to disrupt the economy and devalue the dollar. When the dollars shits crypto will be there to pick up the slack. 100 years ago people bought gold

Last year most of the gains came in a 30 day period. There are 309 days left in 2018. Kwytyerbeliaken and either trade or hold. Don’t run. If you think btc is going to crash then put it in an alt you like. If btc has an orderly decline then the btc/alt price will increase... Man up son. There has been worse, and this too will pass.

He is just doing his master’s bidding. No central bank head is going to say bitcoin is the new standard. Old money is butt hurt by missing all the new market cap gainz.
