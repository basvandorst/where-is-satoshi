Some kind of proof at the [Tor mailing list]( ). 
Also I can vouch for him, I know that he is running nodes for the Tor project.

It's detectable but you will not run into trouble for a non exit relay.

This can scare ISPs fearing about a raid at their data centers because of Tor, but as a node operator myself, I always had in mind that police raiding my home it's something that can happen and I am ok with taking that risk.
And well, I am going to setup two new nodes during the weekend, so I think that as a scare tactic, hasn't been very useful.

I am sorry, but I don't really understand what do you want.

It matches. I am on my mobile, but he names the exits at the linked forum and Ars has published the court order.

Oh, donations can be sent to:

Most bots are in the US and Europe, not Russia or India. You can't launch a decent-sized DDoS attack from India or Russia to MtGox, that's just stupid.
But no, you can't stop a DDoS attack just sending abuse notifications to the involved ISPs and anyway most traffic would be spoofed and more difficult to track. You need infrastructure to eat and filter the DDoS and if it goes bigger, help from your upstreams.
Edit: also you can buy installs, so you get full control of the bots, not only a few DDoS options. You are wrong on that too.
Edit 2: not that I care much, but can someone please explain why I am getting downvotes?

Yeah, I posted this back in the summer. Since then, Bitcoin users have grown exponentially and I created new bots, so I thought a respost wouldn't hurt.
Europeans can also track [Mt.Gox EUR]( and [Bitstamp]( if they prefer.
Donations are not really needed, but if you want to send a tip it will make me smile: 13ADf3N1Ed7fZcuhFRT2iUsb7aoSj4WHx5
Suggestions for new bots are welcome too :)

Do you really need advice? Get it from a professional and not from a community full of fanboys.
And anyone downvote me if you think I am wrong.
