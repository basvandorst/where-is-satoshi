It has a price at all because of it's limited supply and non zero demand. We know the supply hasn't changed (other than it is slowly approaching 21 million BTC) so there must be more demand. The current price is just what the last two people who traded agreed on.

It's not just mining. Anyone can run a full node that does validation without mining. This also helps to keep Bitcoin decentralized. This can currently be done on a raspberry pi, which (unless someone gets a full node running on an arduino) can represent 'maximum node decentralization'. At some block size, these nodes will take longer that 10 minutes to validate a block, knocking them off the network. At some other larger block size, Bitcoin is located in one data centre. [Here's]( Andreas Antonopoulos on the subject.

Right now big fish are making waves in a small pond. If we get to the point where btc is used as often as dollars are, when buying laptops, the pond is now an ocean. Whales can flop about all day and they won't do shit to the sea level. There'll be the tide, the occasional iceberg will melt and what have you but the sea level can be reasonable counted on to be within a tight margin from day to day (relative to the depth of the sea (or market cap, if you catch my drift)).

Is it absolutely essential that groups of people wave guns around and stomp their foot to get the things they want? The universe does not owe you a single thing on that list.
Lets start with roads. Are you trying to tell me that human beings can't make a flat place without threatening violence?
I'd hate to think of the shitty behaviour you could rationalize when you feel so entitled. Just because you can't possibly imagine how children could be educated without stealing my money, doesn't mean that stealing my money is the only way to educate children.

So if an armed robber takes a shit on my chest after robbing me, is he now the government? I didn't ask for a lump of shit on my chest but the robber really really thinks it'll be good for me and that I couldn't possibly survive without a steaming lump of shit on my chest.
I am saying that it is functionally the same. Regardless of the motivations of the person waving the gun, it is morally identical.
I don't think all politicians are bad and that every thing they do can be compared to a lump of shit. But stirring up a hornets nest in the middle east, ruining the lives of non violent drug offenders, prohibition, all that nonsense and more .. I need that like I need a lump of shit on my chest.
Yes, I have benefited from the existence of things that were built with stolen resources. That doesn't mean it was right to steal the resources. It also doesn't mean that the only way those things could possibly come into existence is through threats of violence.
It was morally wrong to own slaves. You shouldn't care how or even if the cotton gets picked after freeing them. It was objectively and morally wrong to own them.
