I get that you're being sarcastic, and that your real position on this issue is probably pretty much the opposite of what you have just posted here, but, that having been said...
You did list off a pretty accurate set of factual statements:
We *didn't* sign an agreement to pay taxes; they're forced upon us.
We *are* forced to abide by this "agreement" that we were never even asked about.
We *don't* have a choice to participate in it.
And that *is* in part thanks to trivial geographic randomness.
All that having been said, I recognize the need and importance of taxes. I realize that the utility we gain from banding together, pooling up our common resources and working coherently maximizes the most benefit for the most people. **I get that.** But, alas, you can't deny that we are forcing people to participate in this system just by existing; they're *born into it*. Which, yeah, that *is* kinda shitty. It's not like we're given a choice between:
A) pay taxes and reap the benefits of doing so
B) don't pay taxes and don't reap the benefits
The choice is made *for* us: A. 
Believe me, if I *had* the choice, I would definitely pick A. *BUT*, I want to have A because ***I chose it, not because it was chosen for me.***

"You also didn't sign an agreement regarding your use of public infrastructure, US economic access, or the benefits of military dominance in foreign policy, yet you enjoy those without complaint."
Just like I didn't sign an agreement that I would give you $30 for that present you bought me last week.
Just because something is given to me, does not mean I am henceforth bound to some obligation to give something back to them.
To say otherwise would be to say that, any time I wanted, I could walk up to you, hand you $15,000 and say, "Your car now belongs to me.". It's forcing a trade.
