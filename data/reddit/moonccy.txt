Theresa May saying the UK needs to seriously monitor bitcoin. Was in the context of terrorism, child pornography, criminal use - which means regulation not banning. No need to panic.

Just for your guide it’s really unlikely tomorrow’s gonna be a manipulated push lower like the last time. I work on a ccy trading floor for a bank, there have been multiple scandals lately where ccy traders have been sent to prison for front running or colluding to manipulate the windows where those kids of contracts are fixed. No major bank is going to risk hundreds of millions or billions in fines to collude with each other in the bitcoin markets. It was easy to do it the first time without major collusion, just had buy a bunch of physical btc before futures went like then short, knowing btc was pushed to a crazy level. Nowhere near as easy this time.

You can work a bid or offer for free and will be executed at your level. If you just try to hit buy or sell you probably will get worse execution than on a major broker, but you also dont pay a trading fee.

You know Tether has only been “inflating” the market under the assumption that bitfinex doesn’t hedge themselves and has just been sitting on a massive bitcoin long position in a falling market right? Every Tether they sell means they buy crypto, but any sensible exchange would then turn around and sell that crypto for USD to hedge themselves, making the effect the same from a Bitcoin price perspective. The only difference is that it would be more positive for price long term cause Tether sales are USD not leaving the market to be taxed, instead the money is just temporarily out of circulation since the owner clearly intends to buy their crypto back once the dip ends, else they would have sold to USD themselves.

As a member of the financial services world, those kinds of disclaimers are super normal. The fine print on any trading service in stock trading would have a long list of disclaimers stating you could lose all your money etc. It's just legal fine print to try to not get sued when people inevitably lose money in one way or another and try to blame them.

A) that’s your own account. B) it’s not about it saying it’s instant, it’s about actually being able to use the money. If you sent me a check or a wire for a significant amount of money I would have to wait days before actually being able to withdraw the entire amount. When you pay bills for instance, it says you’ve “paid”, however the business doesn’t actually have that money for days. In which time that money is frozen within the system and essentially useless.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:30:49
Don't think should really be that controversial. The reason you have such volatility in bitcoin is because there are different investors who believe the underlying value is somewhere between literally zero and  $1million. A 33% chance that something held up only by faith, subject to massive technological and regulatory hurdles, and facing major competition fails at some point dosnt sound crazy. But if theres also a 33% chance you hit that top side then the current worth of btc should still be well higher.

The big advantage vs coinbase is its a much more established company with other interests besides crypto. Youll be able to deal with their customer service vs coinbase's entire lack of it, not pay coinbase's absurd fees, not deal with all of the missing transactions, account closures, etc people are always complaining about with coinbase. Plus its a fiat gateway where a lot of millennials already have their money sitting.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:35:49
Fucking thank you. I mean I could totally be wrong about it, but my normal inclination is that the simplest answer is the most likely, and giant conspiracy theories on the internet tend to be wrong more often than not. If bitfinex wanted to manipulate the price of bitcoin I just don’t see why bother with Tether to begin with. The entire scheme is incredibly convoluted, and would be so hard to pull off in a way that was overly profitable, other than just absconding with everyone’s money. But if that was the goal, Tether is completely unnecessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:46:31

@_date: 2018-01-25 20:55:54
At this point basically. The only reason it worked before was the market had gone parabolic and the ability to short was newly introduced. The only way to make real money off it would be trying to cap rallies with physical bitcoin you had against a short position, forcing it lower while getting progressively shorter. Only works if the market is really weak/ vulnerable like it was before with reg headlines, parabolic up move with noob buyers, etc. No reason to expect that’s going to happen in the next day, in fact would be easier to force an explosive up move at this point. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:31:44
Why would this have artificially increased the price, besides the expectation that the Tether holder will eventually buy back their Bitcoin? Is selling your Bitcoin for the same USD equivalent of Tether or USD somehow different? The only difference is you sold it to the exchange Bitfinex instead of a different investor over coinbase for USD, for example. Maybe Bitfinex is sitting on some massive amount of Bitcoin which they took in in return for that Tether if they didnt decide to hedge themselves to have USD against that Tether they "printed", but the Bitcoin isnt somehow less valuable if its owned by them or a different investor in the market.

So millennials who are the core demographic for crypto ownership will now be able to trade for no fees - vs getting raped by coinbase - and wont have to open a new account with a sketchy service like coinbase. You wouldn't have to worry about the insider trading nonsense as they wouldn't risk the rest of their business model and are experienced with managing insider information. And most importantly, if you're a robinhood investor your money is already on the account, vs having to load money or pay with credit cards on coinbase... This is a really great development.

Sure that makes perfect sense up to a point, however it seems likely to eventually lead to more and more centralization as individuals are priced out of mining entirely right? The more net investment is represented by fewer huge mining orgs, the more resistant they would be towards changes that would improve the overall network, but that might upset their short term profits. They become both more resistant to change and more capable of stopping that change. Not saying there arent major issues with other proposals, but don't feel like I hear this dilemma discussed often.

Try to move a significant amount of money from one person or account to another. Youre going to wait days, and in that time neither counterparty can use that money for anything productive. On that alone there's massive utility.

I think the fundamental difference here is whether Bitfinex is printing Tethers to use to put inflating bids into the market, or if in that exact scenario it makes perfect sense for more Tether to need to be printed. If the market is selling off, people want to hedge their exposure by buying tether to ride out the price decrease and hopefully buy back in at a lower price. In a falling market, demand for tether naturally increases, but if supply were fixed this means the price would increase over 1 to 1, which we have seen happen. Thus to keep it fixed at $1, you need to print more, supply up, price down. The key thing to realize here is that an exchange who is selling Tether is buying bitcoin, which at the very time they are buying is probably moving lower by definition. You are implying that a single exchange is confident enough in being able to move the entire bitcoin market that they are stepping in and risking their own Pnl to take massive Bitcoin long positions to support the market. They would then need to hold onto these massive long positions to hold the market up for any meaningful amount of time. Under the best case scenario a single exchange operating in this way would only be capable of smoothing a massive bitcoin sell off, which wouldnt even be that bad of a thing, under the major assumption that was actually happening.

Major banks are participating in bitcoin futures and looking at being involved in crypto markets in the future, thus makes sense for them to ban employees from owning to try to prevent insider trading scandals. Basically will just stop employees from opening accounts at major fiat for crypto exchanges. This is not bearish.

Bitconnect was a picture perfect Ponzi scheme. This is an actually useful investor tool that makes sense for an exchange trying to gain an edge to offer to attract customers. The runners are publicly known, the exchange is run out of the UK which has some of the most sophisticated financial regulators in the world. Your choices are either tether was a straightforward idea which has been bungled from a PR standpoint by an exchange that probably dosnt want to expose everything else on the exchange to a full audit, or an exchange running a completely insane scheme that they know 100% will fail, while under subpoena, and in a way that they can’t possibly profit from personally in an end game. The second one could be true, but on a human motivational stand point it makes so little sense I just can’t help question it.

If you want any real sized businesses to be involved in bitcoin or crypto in general, then yes Wall Street needs to get involved and comfortable with the product. Businesses don’t do multi million dollar foreign exchange transactions themselves, they use Wall Street trading desks who know how to efficiently execute those kinds of transactions. The more participants and capital enter the market, the sooner bitcoin will find its equilibrium price and be able to function as an effective medium of exchange and wealth storage, rather than moving 50% every few weeks.

And were confusing “regulation” in a western free capital market sense with banning like a communist country such as China would want again... regulation by western countries won’t ban bitcoin, but it will ensure reasonable consumer protection gets put into place, opening the door for exponentially more legitimate money to flow in than the illegal activities they try to curb.

No I am definitely not implying that a full on recession would result in a crypto bull market. I just think that a return to something closer to last year's slow rally with a lack of major inflation in developed countries and fair amount of political uncertainty would be an ideal scenario.

Can anyone give me a straight answer on how Tether has "inflated" Bitcoin? Every Tether printed was bought with Bitcoin, Eth, etc that investors were essentially cashing out. The only difference between them selling for Tether vs USD directly was that at some point you could assume all the money in Tether was going to come back into the crypto market once the owners decided to take it off the sidelines, as Tether functions as a short term hedge primarily. If Tether went to zero the only real effect would be say $2bio of eventual Bitcoin demand is taken out.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:27:43
Are you kidding? Anyone who actually has a vision of Bitcoin becoming a real means of exchange should have increased millennial interest and adoption as their number 1 priority.

This is bitcoins core demographic for very clear reasons, and this is a large source of liquidity for those types of investors.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:59:23
Ok and if that was true, why would a vp at Goldman know for sure that tether was about to fail? Does Goldman bank bitfinex and know the auditor? Goldman also doesn’t actually trade crypto, they only clear futures trades, so not like he’d be profiting from this. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:14:29
Yes I’m very aware it’s been rallying for ages. I work in Markets. However the melt up that has been going on since the tax reform bill was passed is a bit of a different animal. Also if we’re talking about traditional investors they’ve only been remotely involved in crypto since say the second half of 2017? In that time equities rallied, but no where near the pace we’ve seen over the past month. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:09:30
That would be very bullish in terms of eventual institutional investment. They're saying they see the value in the asset class, but before it can be rolled out to retail investors in ETFs etc you would need to clarify major functional valuation questions. You need to be able to report to investors and regulators how much their investment is worth, so standards would have to be established on how this is officially done. These literally don't exist now. Any reaction from a regulator that isn't "were banning cryptos" is bullish.

Who cares if there’s more Tether though if it’s just sitting on an exchange unsold? That would mean Bitfinex just has hundreds of millions of fluff sitting on their books. If they have nothing against it and it went to zero, no real harm done to them. If they do have dollars against it and it drops massively, they can just go ahead and buy it back from the market for less than $1 and lock in profits? The only way it effects anything is if they sell it to someone.

@_date: 2018-01-30 04:26:03
I actually think my above theory does a better job of explaining why we haven’t yet seen a major bounce back even after we’ve stopped falling. A lot of the money we need to come into the space to cause a real move to new ATHs are Making such good returns on traditional investments right now that they just don’t have much incentive to sell any of those investments to allocate back to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:48:34
Incredible to me that it's even a discussion that western governments are going to randomly decide one day to ban all crypto trading. The SEC in the US has been monitoring Bitcoin for the last 5 years, they've auctioned off seized BTC to the public, and have allowed futures contacts to trade publicly. The horse is already out of the barn.  Theyre going to regulate and try to protect consumers/ cut down on money laundering, which is a good thing for the overall market cap. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:51:04
Ok, but its a trade. If I trade you a sandwich for a diamond ring, the diamond ring dosnt become less valuable just because it was traded for almost nothing at some point in the past, as long as there is still someone out there willing to pay me the actual value of a diamond ring. The person now holding a sandwich is f*cked of course, and its not a great outcome. But just because a bad trade was made previously shouldn't somehow crash the current price of a separate asset. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:08:40
Anyone assuming western regulators don’t understand crypto or are going to try to ban bitcoin is pretty dumb.

Well the question isn’t can’t a bank do this, it’s if the tech exists why do you need a bank that’s paying you 0% interest?

Yes I’m aware, and it’s totally possible that’s a good chunk of it. Particularly people having to pay capital gains taxes would definitely cause selling post year end. However, I think it’s really dangerous to try to draw major conclusions from previous data in a market this young. The investor base is very different than this time a year ago, and a lot of people now involved in the space look at investing differently than the early adopters that made up the majority of holders in years past. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:06:35
Ok, but they didn't just give this monopoly money away right? Unless I am very mistaken you have to purchase every $1 worth of Tether by exchanging $1 worth of another crypto asset, correct? Otherwise Bitfinex would literally just be giving away money. It's the same concept as any other ICO, except the only point of it is to remain pegged at $1.

Situation is a total disaster and demonstrates the biggest need for BTC could ever think of. Erdogan has basically shown he’s not going to do anything to stop the Lira imploding, and over 7 in USDTRY and their banks are in danger. But this obviously hasn’t effected the price of BTC, so I assume there either isn’t the liquidity or knowledge for the average Turkish citizen to buy crypto. Would love to hear local take on it if anyone’s out there.

Agree as long as your time horizon is long term. Could wake up with us down in the $5ks tomorrow for all I know, but believe the conditions here are much more real and sustainable for a rally then the last one off short squeeze. The shift will take some time but it feels like the “free money” shorting might be used up, risk reward favors the top side again with sentiment down where it currently is. My job is to pick levels in currencies, and the bet looks smarter here than has in a while. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:44:31
Work in CCY markets, the currency issues happening in Turkey and Argentina are probably the top reasons I’m so bullish crypto long term. Turkey was losing 5-10% per day middle of last week. The president/ dictator of the country has no understanding of the basic functionality of the currency crisis and is vowing to take further control of it, running the economy into the ground in the process. The fact that can happen to a major economy should scare the shit out of people. If you had a significant amount of wealth in a local ccy and didn’t want to put some portion of it into a decentralized ccy once liquidity and regulatory gets sorted out, you’re insane.

But just surprised that this hasn’t begun to have an effect on price given may see runs on Turkish banks this week. Not like gonna buy USD with sanctions, and good luck getting gold out of the country if you buy that.

Well I’d argue that hedge funds are not the only market you’re going after as a bank opening a crypto desk, the real money long term would be in corporate hedging if bitcoin really succeeds as a ccy. But yes Goldman would need to buy or sell the underlying crypto themselves, but the point is they make a rate to the client to take it off their hands then manage the risk themselves, try to make a profit on the spread between the 2. But this allows counter parties on the other side of this to not worry about all of the complex execution side of things, makes it much easier for them to get involved. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:52:27
No as a company you wouldn’t do this every tiny transaction, you would hedge in larger aggregated chunks after a btc balance has built up without having to worry as much about the poor current market liquidity for bulk size transactions. The bank makes a rate to take the risk off your hands and then manages the risk themselves. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:14:06
And I’m sure the general consensus of “we’re definitely going to $5k” among people couldn’t be leading to reckless shorting with no catalyst to bring us down there other than pulling a number out of a hat, and risk reward radically tilted to the upside. If you actually thought $5k was a real bottom and there is any chance of seeing ATHs again why wouldn’t you be buying well ahead of that with a stop below?

I agree that USD as the world reserve currency dosnt make a lot of sense, especially when there’s a madman in charge. But Turkey did most of this to itself. Erdogan has refused to take any of the obvious measures necessary to contain a currency crisis and his need for ever increasing political power lead to the conditions for it to begin with.

Still not sure why it surprising that people who had gone into tether or were holding tether before a dip subsequently bought the dip... since why the fuck else would they be holding tether rather than cashing out to USD or holding actual crypto... it’s a market timing mechanism. Anyway regardless if the heights of the bubble was driven by tether the value of the mass awareness the press of the run up gave bitcoin and crypto means there really is no going back to the pre- bull run market... unless you believe this is all actually worthless in which case not sure why you’d invest anything to begin with.

Points to proof that tether dip buys were clustered around $500 price increments and that proved its “not random” so manipulated... because in a totally speculative market with everyone and their brother trying to be technical analysts there’s no way that round numbers would have psychological significance for people trying to buy dips...

It's actually the best news I can imagine, because if all the banks got together and stonewalled crypto, they could really slow it down by hurting the fiat link. But as long as there's big opportunities for profit by being the few one's who break ranks, there will still be holes in the fiat wall. It's basically game theory.

No but it’s a hell of a lot easier to influence attempted rallies at technical levels when you can actively short vs just selling long only stacks.

Were you hoping to make 100% in a month and sell and get out and needed that money you invested back short term for essentials? If so you should probably cut your losses and sell. If you actually think this is a multi year investment like you should if you’re investing in this space on fundamentals then you should buy small clips on the way down to average in your cost better without trying to time the bottom, cause this could last for months and get significantly worse. You shouldn’t invest more than you can afford to lock up long term in this space, if you thought it was gonna take a week then you could cash out money you’re better off going to Vegas.

Only difference is previous currencies were accepted based on centralized authority, while bitcoin is based on decentralized authority... which naturally scares central authorities.

People had been noting for a while now that Bitcoin was increasingly correlated with the fear index, selling off on equity down moves vs it's previous lack of correlation. Makes sense that in major global asset sell offs Bitcoin's sell off would just get worse, but could get us to a good buying point finally once the bleeding stops globally.

So the big problem with this post is that it isn’t a market crash, it’s just profit taking and reallocation after an out of control run post tax reform. Stocks are a tad lower because interest rates are rising due to continued really good economic data, which we got more of on Friday. It’s literally the opposite of a recession. 
However the sentiment that the money coming off the table could go to crypto isn’t wrong, just it wouldn’t be doing it to escape some impending crash, just money looking for growth opportunities now that US equities look short term toppish.

When stocks have gone up like 30% in a year then it’s not panic selling its called taking profit. No ones gonna move all of their money to crypto but you don’t need that, just need them to allocate some of the money they took off the table to a nice entry point in crypto, not that crazy.

@_date: 2018-02-04 14:29:04
Yeah not sure why this is surprising, it’s a pretty huge risk if you or someone else who got access to your credit card just bought untraceable crypto instantly. No one should be leveraging up to buy crypto anyway, that’s how you fuck your life up.

Futures don’t trade on the weekend so you can break technical levels and pump much easier. Pretty obvious.

Relevant bits since may be pay wall:
	A handful of smaller European banks are breaking ranks with the rest of the sector by giving investors access to cryptocurrencies and advising on initial coin offerings, despite an intensifying effort by regulators to clamp down on the area.
Vontobel and Falcon Bank, the Swiss private banks, are among the lenders that are agreeing to handle cryptocurrency-based investments on behalf of their clients. Germany’s Fidor Bank and Liechtenstein’s Bank Frick are also providing such services. 
“There are risks involved but there are also really big opportunities,” Edi Wögerer, chief executive of Bank Frick, told the Financial Times. “We know what to do from a security perspective so this is a big opportunity for banks like us.” He said bigger banks were “scared” of cryptocurrencies “because they don’t understand them, they feel threatened”. 
Oliver Bussmann, president of the Crypto Valley Association in Switzerland’s canton of Zug near Zurich, said that because the largest lenders were sitting on the sidelines and refusing to handle cryptocurrencies it was opening the door to smaller banks and specialist firms. “More and more bankers are coming in,” he told the FT. 
Bank Frick advises companies on initial coin offerings and vets their investors before they can buy tokens in return for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. Mr Wögerer said it had “huge demand” for this service and had advised on about 10 ICOs. “We are very selective.”

Yeah any real catalyst here and can fly, but probably needs some kind of spark to keep going. Shorts too comfortable selling above $8200 now, pop some SLs through there and we’re off with a violent move, but needs a trigger. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:36:06
I agree in a way. If you wanted to see a chart that looked similar to bitcoin over the past year, the only one I can find is being short volatility. This is the same thing as selling options, taking in premiums and betting that nothing bad will happen, which worked spectacularly for all of 2017. As long as nothing bad happened in the bitcoin world it would just keep going higher, as it seemed like no risk free money. However now we got hit with a year's worth of bad news all in one month. Your job now is to say are any of these news items actually bad enough to send us to zero, or bet on a return to normalcy when you can start cashing in on the gains again.

Yeah not saying there isn’t, guys that I discuss with all the time that get it. Just making the point that by the very nature of how difficult it is to even get your hands on crypto (particularly in the US), investors in the space are inherently more sophisticated than this is giving them credit for. Meanwhile I’m sure the same source would say continuing to blindly pump money into the top of the stock market at the end of the cycle is prudent investing.
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:28:46
What a fucking absurd comment. Investors plowing all of their money into passively invested 401ks which will eventually become systemically inefficient are unsophisticated. I work with really sophisticated people in the finance industry, and if they’re over the age of 35 there’s like a 90% chance they can’t wrap their minds around how to even get their hands on alt coins, let alone the actual potential of blockchain past literally bitcoin = gold/ tulips?

I didn’t even know this was up for a decision today or yeah seeing the details of their proposal would have been a pretty easy short since you could easily see a regulator wouldn’t be cool with that. I work in currency markets where the kind of fixing manipulation they’re afraid of happens all the time and is a major concern, and that’s in the currencies of sovereign nations. Manipulation of a single exchange is definitely a concern, no reason to approve that as the first product in the market over one that uses multiple sources...

Yeah turns out having a bunch of really angry defrauded investors is pretty bad for a functioning society. A lot of people are very gullible and can be easily duped into scam investments if the proper protections aren’t in place. Governments have a pretty big incentive to prevent that, regulations are a fact of life, if crypto and blockchains are useful and profitable regulation won’t stop them long term.
