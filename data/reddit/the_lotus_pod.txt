Just checked price and Bitcoin was $130.44 on this day October 8th 2013. Would be a whopping $3105.20 at the current price of $4363.70.
Anybody have any records of your first Bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:11:55
Best time to buy Bitcoin was in 2010, second best time to buy Bitcoin is NOW!
I don't have a lot of money, but I make sure to put at least $100 towards BTC every check. Wait for the dip, no matter how low and be proud you're supporting a new thing. Even buying at ATH is okay, fun to watch the market. You'll never sell low if you're HODLING YO!
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:36:04
lmao you're on drugs.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:40:44
I bought a measily $100 worth at $4400. Was going to wait but if $4400 turns to $10,000 (remember it wasn't even thought it would hot $100 at one point) I'll have double my money, and some. I might have lost some now, but when hasn't bitcoin dropped slightly and gone right back up. Maybe you thought "I'll wait till $2800" at $3000, well you missed that chance.
You're going to buy bitcoin regardless, stop waiting and just buy. No reason to sit and wait for a $200-$400 price drop when it's consistantly higher every year. You're just wasting time.
TL;DR STOP WAITING AND START BUYING

Get the transaction number and check it out on blockchain.info
PM me for other info, maybe send me the TXID and I can explain to you what everything means.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:08:56
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:57:05
What website.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:14:52
Absolutely, but I would wait a little bit or find a wallet that supports SegWit. Some wallets have a set TX Fee. Maybe I'm wrong, somebody correct me?
Edit: Forgot to add that most exchanges charge you a price also, so you're paying them as well as the TX Fee on the Bitcoin Block Chain network.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:55:04
Absolutely. I've been following bitcoin for awhile now, and I feel like I'm less interested when I have no money put into it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:32:17
It is.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:36:47
I used Bitcoin Core and made sure my router was port forwarding correctly. Took me 45.3 hours. Left it running all night, the estimations on the download screen are DEFINITELY not correct, so don't pay attention to them.
My blockchain is 141 gb, and uses about a half a gig of ram, I havr 8gb in my PC. Doesn't really increase my cpu or gpu temparture, but I notice my internet sucks ass when download a block.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:43:48
So what exactly is the difference between Segwit and Segwit 2x
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:39:40
Check out these graphics. You can see how once the BCH difficulty dropped, it took a few days for people to realize that it would be better to mine BCH instead of BTC (And the price increase), so this graph will keep you informed when shit is starting to go back to normal. We're expecting BCH to get a difficulty hike simply because the hashrate increased a shit ton, so there's that.

@_date: 2017-08-24 21:34:26
Fan is probably going out, just replace it with an after market one. Fans just move air through your case, running a node doesn't really cause crazy stress on a computer like mining does. My PC temp is exactly the same idle as running a node.

Wow, literally 3? Not even 3. This might take some time to implement...
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:52:33
Maybe I should ask what IS SegWit 2x? Maybe I simply don't know. I'm curious and would like to know what makes it so much worse
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:27:42
Not to keep your coins in. If you buy coins, put them on a software wallet and SAVE THE PRIVATE KEY.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:51:07
But with a USB drive and Veracrypting the drive, wouldn't it be safe then, as long as you have your back up words wrote down of sorts?
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:15:58
Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:41:51
SegWit increased the block size by removing certain header information and other code to an extended block. It really didn't make the block size bigger, but did allow for more things since they removed some stuff.
Yes, SegWit added more scripting options to allow for the Lightning Network to work with Time Lock Operations which is what the Lightning Network has chose to use.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:11:55
That's like asking me how Bitcoin Cash was created. I HAVE NO IDEA.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:08:38
LOL. I love thinking about it like that. Haha
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:39:41
SegWit allows for more transactions per block. Bitcoin's Block chain was so clogged pre-SegWit that if you wanted to get a transaction verified quick, you had to pay to get to the front of the line for verification meaning fee's were high as shit for transfering Bitcoins and if you picked a low fee it could take hours if not days.
With SegWit, the blocks are bigger and can handle more transactions per block meaning less transfer fee's (Called TX Fee's) and WAY quick verification.
Any questions, please PM me!
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:31:35
There are 2^160 addresses for Bitcoin Block Chain and there are 10^78 to 10^82 atoms in the known universe. So it's about half.

@_date: 2017-08-26 22:29:52
Wasn't their wallet know to have a security flaw?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:27:05
I've done this in the past. I'm unsure of the fee, but you'd be selling you coins for like $20-$30 cheaper than market price.
Yes, you can sell bitcoin on Coinbase and have them transfer the funds to your paypal.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:21:16
It's a temp bandaid while we figure out what to do.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:17:59
So does SegWit 2x hard fork and SegWit soft forks?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:44:01
1,461,501,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses are available. Currently, in the roughly 8 years the Bitcoin Block Chain has been running there have been 16,254,090 individual Block Chain addresses. 
If we take that number divided by the amount of years it's been running, that's roughly 2,031,761 addresses per year. In order to hit the max number of addresses, it would take 719,327,520,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.
We're good.

I was thinking the exact same thing, but if SN was japanese (Like some think) it could be backwards for that reason. I 100% believe it to be Nick Szabo also, but no proof in the pudding, so I'm fine not knowing.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:22:08
How I see it Litecoin could be used for the smaller transactions like buying food at a restaurant or paying for gas. Bitcoins could be used for large scale things like purchasing cars, houses, businesses. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:59:18
Electrum has a few different wallets. They have a software for Bitcoins and a software for Litecoins. Make sure to download the correct one so you don't send your coins to the wrong wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:00:51
Remember to get your private key, and keep it in a secure place. Do not EVER keep your currency in an exchange, nothing but bad news there. If you don't own your private key, you don't own your coins.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:26:05
Like others have said, get a hot wallet, something like Electrum for which you can access your private key and/or wallet.dat file. Those you can't get from Coinbase. No private key, no bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:45:38
You've never heard of Mt. Gox!?!?!?
You have a lot of learning to do my friend.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:14:30
Yes, it is perfectly fine to purchase and transfer your coins from Coinbase. I do this, and actually have a schedule setup to do this so I don't have to manually buy them.
The software lets you see your amount of bitcoins in the lower left corner, you might have to enable which currency you use, which would be in your options.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:16:18
I should really read BIP write ups. I'm horrible at keeping up to date because there is just so much shit happening at once.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:27:46
Do not use coinbase as a wallet. Google Mt. Gox and you'll understand why. Make sure you have the private of your wallet. IF YOU DON'T OWN YOU PRIVATE KEY, YOU DON'T OWN YOUR BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:31:03
Then transfer your coins to a software wallet and keep transfering your coins to that wallet. Use something like Electrum, you can save your wallet.dat AND your private key. With your private key (I'd print it, physical can't be hacked like on a PC) you can then go to any computer in the world and access your coins. With coinbase, you don't own the private keys, they do, meaning THEY own your coins.
Questions, PLEASE PM me. I hate watching people lose their bitcoins, I lost 12.6 back on Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:15:08
You're asking the question everybody is asking. It's not my money, it's yours.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:18:17
For the love of God do not use Coinbase as your wallet. Get a software wallet that you own the private keys to. NO PRIVATE KEYS, NO COINS.
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:26:06
Same here. I bought 1.77 bitcoin in 2013 and sold it right away losing money in the process of panic selling. Wish I would have held...
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:27:00
PM me if you have any questions, I'm always willing to help.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:19:39
Fee's are only high if you accept to pay them. I sent a 0.05 BTC transaction for less than $0.10 yesterday and it took less than 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:07:11
I've seen coin control on my Bitcoin Care wallet, any documentation on how to use it?
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:53:53
Bitcoin addresses start with a 1, SegWit addresses start with a 3.
Edit: This information is wrong, see post.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:53:17
Good luck. Diversifying is good, but you have to have a slight understanding on how it works, and this isn't the correct way to do it. The coin market cap of all currencies is constantly changing. Next week 3 other coins could take the 8th, 9th, and 10th spot.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:37:56
If you have the private key of a wallet (You mentioned you did have the private key), download Electrum and import it with Debug Console. Takes a few seconds and you'll be able to access your coins in no time!
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:01:15
SegWit has been activated. To get a SegWit address, you need a wallet that supports it. Bitcoin Core supports it, but you have to activate your SegWit address through the debug command line option (I think the next update (0.15) will include an option for SegWit). If you are not using Bitcoin Core wallet, please find a wallet that allows SegWit wallet creation from your current wallet. Google will assist you with this.
What is SegWit? It's a Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) that strips a bunch of data from the major blocks being added to the Blockchain and allows for more information to be stuffed into them for transactions as well as larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:04:46
Woah damn. You've taught me something I never knew. Where can I read all this information?
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:35:35
If you have to ask, then it isn't.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:33:18
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:52:49
From Coinbase? You'd have to send your coins from Coinbase to your Electrum wallet. You can't import your private key into Electrum, because Coinbase doesn't give you the private keys.
Before sending anything to your Electrum wallet, you should make sure your private key and your .dat are backed-up.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:17:58
If that exchange goes down, so does the money. I wouldn't trust it.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:08:15
The biggest issue with cryptocurrency right now is that nobody accepts it. I don't really know of any government that has switched money like the blockchain will be doing in the future, but I think we're in an amazing time now to see exactly how it's happening. Shit, even Lambo is accepting bitcoin. How fucking amazing is that.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:13:57
Do you have the private keys for your Coin accounts on these exchanges?
Fiat is absolutely not safe on exchanges. It's not even involved with a Blockchain which could potentially help in the end if you had private keys for coins, but you said you have no coins.
I'd say no, your fiat is not safe.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:09:08
Summer 2020 will be pleasant!
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:26:07
Seriously, I agree. Between the shit posts and the "SHOULD I BUY OMG" I'm starting to get sick of this shit.

Take a piece of paper and write down a number for each person. Copy that piece of paper, and for every person that joins the "group", add their name and a number next to them and give each person that same paper. That number next to that persons name is a serial code for something that can be traded between them two. Documents, car vin, bill for trash. For this example, I'll ONLY be using the number, nothing physical or digital is being exchanged. Say you and I want to trade numbers, you give me the number 1 and I give you the number 6. Tell everybody to switch those numbers on their paper and we both tell them all that we are trading numbers.
Boom, we just traded numbers and everybody acknowledges it and has a record. This can be used for trading literally anything, not only 'bits' used as money. If one block chain shows that you own document  and you want to give Jessica your document (Maybe a car title, or a house) you give her document  and tell the network you want to give her this. They do some calculations (Blockchain works off of cryptography to keep things safe) and verify you had the document, and that it's really you giving the document to her, and they all copy the ledger, so everybody has the same information.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:24:26
I'd stick with a hardware wallet with raving reviews like the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor. Read up on them and make sure they fit yours needs before purchasing.

@_date: 2017-09-03 07:02:53
NEVER EVER KEEP ANY CURRENCY ON A WEBSITE WALLET. THIS INCLUDES GDAX AND COINBASE.
If you do not have your private key for your wallet, those coins are not yours and GDAX nor Coinbase gives you those keys. ALWAYS move your coins from an exchange. You want your private key as you can input it into any software wallet and have access to your coins. Again, WITHOUT YOUR PRIVATE KEY, YOUR COINS ARE ABSOLUTELY USELESS.
If you're looking to sell your coins, you'd move them back to Coinbase and sell with the 'Sell' option. I use PayPal to get my coins out.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:06:34
A software wallet. I use Bitcoin Core, but that downloads the entire ~144 gb Blockchain. For starters, I'd use the Bitcoin version of [Electrum](
I can not stress enough to make sure your private keys are backed up.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:57:14
$10 is not too little. Everybody starts somewhere. I invested $10 in Litecoin after I bought ~$100 in Bitcoin around a month ago. Remember, if you're using Coinbase, transfer your coins to GDAX (Coinbases exchange) since it's free to transfer to another wallet. If moving from a software wallet down the line, REMEMBER to watch the TX Fee's. Don't let them take $6 of your $10 for fee's when transactions are getting verified as low as $0.08.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:19:25
I personally think it’s Nick Szabo because in one of his messages to Hal Finley, he said there was a way to personalize an address and he did just that with the first letter of his first and last name.
It wasn’t SN, but NS.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:29:36
This. I can sell a bitcoin for whatever the person is paying, I'm not selling it to them for more because of a sale charge, I'm simply setting up a sell offer and somebody is buying it. Wtf is wrong with that?
