Same here man... I put in $18,100 when it was $19,500, and as soon as I hit the buy botton, it just went down from there... im seriously considering losing 1 or 2 k if the price ever comes close to 19k again.

Bought a whole bitcoin at 19.5k...

I got up to the bathroom like at 2am and checked coinbase, and i was like " oh shit, let me sell now thats very high and in the morning by low"... cachingggg profit.

I think this is true. My problem is that when i got in a month ago, all it kept doung was go up and up with no stop. Maybe I thought it will always be thats way unrealistically.

This is correct. I first bought at $8,269 on Nov 20th and like the idea of trading. It sucks big time! If i had hodl like everyone told me to from the star, i would be sitting in like 11k profit.

Oh oh... just went up from 13.9k to 14k,  think I spoke too soon. 25k, here we come!

Thank you all for the words of encouragement. I really needed that. Long Live the HODL!

I would love to have your friend's  with the 100mil problem.

I only been into bitcoins for a month and one thing i really dont like about it is how easy is manipulated by many events. I dont mind hodling, but it seems like everytime it wants to go up, someone sneezes and it goes down 3k again.

I bought $18,100 worth when it was $19,500. So, image how I feel...
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:57:58
Bought at $19,500, $18,400 worth of it. But I did a little trading last week and manage to make it into a whole coin, so I got that going for me...

Its so funny that it hurts. Im that guy. Now I want to cry.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:24:36
Hey thanks a lot. Im looking right now in Amazon for one. Another question... i see thats like a memory stick. So I transfer my coins there and then I can put that away and it will always be there? I mean, I just unplug from the pc and stash it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:07:30
Where can I buy one bit coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:06:30
Can you explain that please. Why do I need one?
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:29:01
19.5 here.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:47:27
The spot was reseved when bitcoins was $19.8. With today's price, they had to cancel the ad.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:24:24
I will sell as soon as it goes up to $25k. Im here for the investment and making money, not for the hodl.
