Bitcoin will free the world
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:45:40
This is not true, technologically savvy Venezuelans are already adopting Bitcoin as part of their daily lives to fight deflation

1. Use BTC instead of BC
2. Use buybitcoinworldwide to see which are the parties supporting buying bitcoin in your country
3. install wallet and learn how to secure private key
4. Have fun and welcome to this sub

You can find the same or even better info using google. Only real dummies will spend money to go and buy the book
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:43:07
It is always good time to buy BTC
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:21:09
OTC (your friends or someone u know), Coinbase (if u want a trusted exchange), buybitcoinworldwide (to check which third party supports fiat to crypto in your country)
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:45:15
Fiat is bullshit, gold is too heavy to carry, Bitcoin is the future!
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:38:16
Mine would be the very essence of decentralization which is currently dominated by mining pools which makes it very centralized.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:24:57
Impact of Tether on Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole is definitely positive. As this means people are willing to give up fiat to hold crypto. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 06:53:10
Government and Bitcoin has never been compatible, unless government is the one who holds all the private keys, which technically mean the ownership of all Bitcoin will go to the government. Again another manipulation opportunity
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:43:08
Nice reference point, instead of having to search each individual website for it. Kudos 
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:02:05
Time to get my lambo
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:09:14
It is always a good time to buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:07:56
Buy some when it drops below 6k, then buy some more if it goes down to 5k. Lowest possible based on my guts is 3k. So just keep buying and lambo will be yours one day
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:43:23
Yes i know, but which source do u get the data from?
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:51:53
Buy Bitcoin all day everyday, because of the fundamental value, not the price
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:17:18
Best is to enter with Dollar Averaging Cost method, where u buy with consistent amount every month. Say if you buy Bitcoin with $100 consistently on the 1st of every month, 12 months later u would have invested $1,200 and the fluctuation in prices wouldn't bother you, as you bought in at all price ranges. As long as Bitcoin value holds in the long run, you will definitely be at lowest risk with decent return.
@_date: 2018-09-07 06:50:14
If it keeps dipping, then keep buying.
It will go up eventually 
@_date: 2018-09-16 09:56:23
Baby boomers saw the stock market boom and [Dot.com]( bubble burst. Our generation saw Bitcoin challenging traditional fiat currency. Such an eventful world.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:58:01
Pump might be mainly due to $100 million worth of Tether being moved to Bitfinex exchange. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:42:18
Time to clear my bank account for BTC. Stock it up while price is still below $7,500
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:50:41
overinflation is allowing Bitcoin to shine as a store of value with no government intervention

Every 30min from the time i woke up till the time i sleep :)

Just another way for the banks to cheat citizen's money and grow their centralize systems even stronger. Banks are always the largest ponzi schemes
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:59:03
100BTC is still very small in comparison to the 200k BTC that are transacted every 24hrs (Based on [Blockchain.info](
At least 30% of daily volume to see the benefit of lightning network
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:01:31
Bank should get the fucked out of crypto, they will bring us back to the centralized world and control the heck out of us all
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:25:22
Because they are able to see how big the industry is going to be in the near future, and they gotta compete against binance
@_date: 2018-09-14 08:36:29
1000x more definitely possible, the question is how long would it take?
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:34:44
Get a hardware wallet such as ledger or trezor 
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:59:50
Cools! Bitcoin will be used to pay for groceries all around the world in no time and replace fiat currencies.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:02:27
Nice\~ from which source did u guys get pricing data from?
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:09:55

Would be weird to be waiting 10min for block confirmation standing in front of the cashier
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:00:17
Fundamentals is always the same old Demand vs Supply
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:54:32
2 years later, your friends who put all their money into Bitcoin bought lambo, and your wife will scold u for not putting all the money into Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:48:45
This is just recovery, the actual rally is coming soon and its gonna moon
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:00:57
With exchanges becoming extremely centralized and governments coming into play, the next thing we will be looking at is definitely decentralized exchanges. Not very popular at the moment, but will definitely take off like how Bitcoin did
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:43:30
If there a bitcoin atm map?
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:39:08
ETF will cause the entire crypto market to be even more speculative than as of current. I believe we should be focusing on how to make the world a better place with this awesome new technology, instead of just rushing to make the richest even richer
@_date: 2018-08-27 08:46:47
Decentralized exchanges are the way to go, but the complexity in terms of setting up wallet and using DEX for newcomers just seem to be impossible to get DEX flying until more newcomers are savvy in this market.
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:21:56
It is good that ETF is not allowed, or else there will be more speculation, less real world applications
