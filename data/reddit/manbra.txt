You could always call you bank and cancel the the transaction. Coinbase will send angry and you won’t be to buy from them again, but you won’t over pay for coin

Good job wasting all that money on a tiny fucking patch that you have to zoom in to read.  
Should have just paid a league of legends streamer to talk about it every 30 minutes and would have gotten 1000x the exposure for far, far cheaper.  
'Hey stream viewers - I'd love if you guys checked out r/bitcoin and donated with BTC!' from dyrus would bring so much more traffic than some silly patch.

I mashed teh buy &amp; sell button and made a bunch of USD / BTC until an exchange took it all. 
This summarizes my BTC experience perfectly.

Loooooool.  If you srsly do plan on buying in, I'd highly recommend making a coinbase account right now.  You're limited to 3k USD for the first 30 days.  That fucked me p hard.

Awesome.  Do you have any proof that you're the rep? Perhaps post on twitter?  I think you are, but, it may be hard to actually spread the good news (if it comes) with all the FUD / lies that goes around in the BTC world.

Don't use local bitcoins.  Make a coinbase account, wait a few days, then buy

Sina Weibo is a Chinese microblogging (weibo) website. Akin to a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook, it is one of the most popular sites in China, in use by well over 30% of Internet users, with a market penetration similar to what Twitter has established in the USA.[
Weibo is legit.

If I don't have to make an account just to look through the site.  I checked out the site, clicked, and was treated by an account creation page.  Closed the tab instantly.  If I got to click, see some prices / pictures of pizza, then was greeted by a BTC payment address + account creation, I'd probably use the service.

I keep it on in the back ground if I'm not actively paying attention to TV / BTCWisdom (playing video games, chores, etc).  If I hear a bong (over x BTC / min), I know to run back to computer.

I thought bitcoins / cryptocurrencies were silly.  Then in early december a friend gave me 5k doge. 
It's now March and I've quit my job / dropped my classes this semester to mine / day trade full time.  Doge is definitely a gateway drug, at least in my case.

Thank you for your expert opinion on Japanese bankruptcy law.
This shit is extremely aggregating.  If you don't fuckjng know what you're talking about, don't post.  I'm sure you declaring bankruptcy in Canada has so much in common with a company in Japan filing bankruptcy.  Even if it does you're still not a god damn lawyer, so why even comment?

It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense

@_date: 2014-04-11 14:19:46
I uhhh, sure, but let me preface this by saying that I am 100% amateur and only been for a few months, so I'm rly just mashing buttons and getting lucky..
1.  I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but, I trade BTC/USD throughout the day / night.  When I have to sleep I'll set buys / sells based on the overall market sentiment / indicators (then lay in bed watching the price on my phone, nervous as shit, until I doze off..)  I keep my money on exchanges, either in fiat or BTC.  It's rarely a mix of Fiat / BTC.  I only withdrawal BTC to cash on Coinbase every few weeks when I run low / want to waste money on stupid shit. 
2.  Anywhere from a few to 20+, depending on the kind of day.  Since 5 am this morning, I've made 4 trades.  I probably don't make as many trades compared to others because I'm noob and only trade when confident.  If I'm trading Altcoins or on BTCChina (no fees, but low volume), I'll trade much, much more.  On Bitfinex I'll make much bigger trades, but not nearly as many.  Even with just a few trades, I'm constantly reading, learning, and watching charts throughout the day.  
3.  I am mostly BTC/USD.  Sometimes BTC/CNY (Chinese Yuan) on BTCChina.  I got my start with Doge (fuck doge now), so I'll occasionally dabble in shitcoins, but I've dabbled less and less as my BTC holdings grow - I think it's way too easy to lose your shirt with shitcoins.  And the volume always sucks.  I'll occasionally risk 1-5 BTC on something stupid, if I'm very confident.  I also have 6.5 MH/s of hashing, so if I'm mining a newly released coin, I'll mostly trade that for a few days.  
4.  I've just started shorting, actually, on Bitfinex.  Only done it a few times because still learning / gaining confidence.  
5.  My total USD value is slightly negative - there's no easy way to buy a large amount of BTC @ market price, and be able to trade it instantly.  I've been stuck maxing my daily CB limit during lows, but, it takes 5+ days to get the coin, so I'm screwed if the price drops at all - the last few weeks have been brutal. That being said, I doubled the money I made early mining doge (then lost it on Bitcoinbuilder..) and I'm up 7 BTC~ or so this week.  
6.  Nah, BTC is the first thing I've ever playtraded.  
7.  I don't rly have any strong feelings towards BTC from a political / social PoV.  It does take up 95% of my time and interest, but that's mostly because I find the whole puzzle of trading to be very interesting and making money in my boxers between rounds of video games is the perfect life.  When I first got into Cryptos I was very caught up 'to the moon' - I was overly bullish and traded on pure sentiment.  I took significant loses from drinking too much coolaide (most recently, I was worried about a random moon trip, so I maxed coinbase purchases for the first few days..(learned my lesson, waiting for bottom for the rest of my buy in)).   I constantly ask myself if I'm truly bullish/bearish at this very moment or I'm just caught up in the hype.  That being said, I plan on being in BTC long term because I think it will be successful.  
8. Yes, kinda.  I'm 20something live-at-home college student, so BTC provides me plenty of beer and gas money.  I made more in the last few months than a year+ working at my previous shitty college student job.  As far as trading full time beyond this?  Maybe.  I was left a decent sized inheritance - only trading with 2.6% of it.  If I continue to trade successfully I'll give myself more capital to work with, but this won't happen for awhile.  
Pls don't think I'm some fancy day trader - really just some kid who mashes buy / sell and gets lucky.  
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:18:44
Really? Is day to day storage really that bad of an idea?  I have &lt;2 BTC on crypsty that I just leave there.  It's a pain to transfer back and forth, and I would miss out on some trades.  Are the risks real or are people taking this too far?  Ya, sure, I'd be annoyed if I lost 2 BTC, but it wouldn't be the end of the world and I probs wouldn't care in a year.  I'm new to the crpytocoin world (part of the doge herd) - have any big exchanges been robbed recently?
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:15:12
Doubtful.  
I forgot I subbed for OGN League of Legends shit a few months back.  Every month it bills my paypal account.  I thought I canceled it already, but I literally just got an email about it.  Another 8 bucks gone for something I used a few times and that I can find for free on youtube.  If it was BTC I would have payed once and never again - I'm sure I'm not the only one who is lazy about canceling subscriptions.  Why would they give up that ez pz cash?

No, we've been throwing money at Africa since Euro colonies pulled out and left them dry.  It hasn't really helped.  Giving them a bitcoin would be even more waste full - already they could use bitcoin. 
 I have no idea what I'm talking about, but perhaps, in the far future p, bitcoin (or an alternative) could be in economically unstable shit holes.  Families can keep their meager savings savings against poor monetary  policies and be used to at markets n shit along national borders.
But this won't happen for many, many years, and probably not at all
