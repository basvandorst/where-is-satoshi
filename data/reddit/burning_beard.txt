I think he filed for backruptcy protection to cover his ass because the funds were seized and the transaction malleability was used as a smokescreen by his handlers. 
I'm also waiting for a DOJ or ICE homepage to be put up on mtgox.com

I kinda thought season 1 was slow, 2 was very well done, but too much unecessary family drama, but 3 was one of the best seasons of any television show I've ever seen. Alot of things happen, it's handled well. Lots of CIA stuff.

Why not run it?
Decentralized meaning no one has absolute power, i.e. like a certain magical mystery person we all know.
Decentralized in an open-source sense. No one person is in total control, no one person has ownership? (yes, project ownership, but anyone is free to fork/use it)

Doing it manually. Ususally only go through 4 trades a day. I looked at charts, noticed micro spikes up and down. Did the math to see where I needed to be to make at least .05 to .1BTC. Then I set my custom order in MTGox and waited for it to fill. Never did it not go. There are so many weird spikes all day long, and sometimes wild fluctuations at night. 
If your buy doesnt go through, no sweat, your still making money. 
I do use a script to monitor my buys. If I buy, I get notified or texted if I'm not at the PC. Then I go put in a sell. Your sell will always get filled eventually since it keeps rising.
I just sold at 24 and buying back at 22.5. Volume of coins helps. I'm going to be pumping in a few more bucks to up my percentages.

I can't afford books. I wasted all my money in teh bitcoynz.
I'm not going to blame ACH if I can take my debit card tied to my checking account and buy delicious cheese, then check my balance to see my cheese money gone. I blame dwolla for charging me fees and not using those fees to enhance my speed of transfer with whatever speed that whoever charges. Besides, paypal, even before ebay's purchase, took 1 day max for transfers after purchases.

Thats exactly what its doing. Shell script on lbt.com grabs data.json from mtgx.com, stick into a db, text file, whatever you want, every few seconds. Clients visiting lbt.com load the javascript chart, the js chart polls lbt.com/livedata.php at a specified interval. The js chart plots data from livedata.php on your pc. All livedata.php does is get the data from db or text file and format data for the chart. 


I'm planning to add these features soon.
The actual charting javascript is from highcharts.com. I just coded a way to integrate btc data into it realtime. It's license is free for non-profit so you might have an issue if you want to put it on your exchange, its a few hundred for a license i think. I would love to purchase one, its a fantastic piece of code and I'm only scratching 0.01% of its surface. I'd be glad to help you with anything I can, but I'm terrible with js, this is a learning experience.

Refresh, there's an option for another slower chart - although MtGox seems to have died after the rush, their numbers aren't moving.

It's extremely frustrating that this happens to us plebians, I'm sure bank-to-bank transfers and merchants don't have to deal with this nonsense, but someone somewhere wants to hold my money for microinterest.
My issue is in reality, this stuff shouldn't take that long. I can post my penis to twitter in seconds but I can't get a couple of bytes of ones and zeros from one server to another in the "banking" world without it being slower than the US Postal Service. 
As I stated above, after my account was verified, it still took a week to transfer the money to MtGox. I don't know if or why the second transaction would be faster, but their won't be a second transfer from dwolla because I won't be using it.
I wish it was a minute! Ive been making that disgusted waiting face for 2 weeks.
I love the idea of Bitcoin because I won't have to deal with this regulatory nonsense.

I had to add - 
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false - theres no reason to save the cert or even use it if your just getting data.
Thats what I used for [my ticker]( after it stopped working last night. I'm pretty sure its been up since for me.
I verified this after this after finding wget --no-check-certificate worked when curl did not after the "change" last night. Wget is invaluable for troubleshooting curl.
Edit, just saw that your original used that, maybe try changing returntransfer to true instead of 1
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER 	TRUE to return the transfer as a string of the return value of curl_exec() instead of outputting it out directly. 
Here's what is working for me:
				$curl_handle = curl_init();
				curl_setopt ($curl_handle, CURLOPT_URL, $feed);
				curl_setopt ($curl_handle, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $useragent);
				curl_setopt ($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
				curl_setopt ($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 10);
				curl_setopt ($curl_handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
				$return = curl_exec($curl_handle);
				curl_close($curl_handle);

IANAL but are currency exchanges illegal or sketchy(legal wise)?
Define better. My better means faster, like a mailed check or wire transfer being faster than this. I will be using a bitcoin market or another means of aquiring coins.
My issues are with the amount of time it took for this method. It's a warning to new users who expect to buy in at 10 and actually get in at 15 because of how long it takes. Tell a market trader that wants a stock at 5 but because of processing time he has to pay 8.

We don't know what funds, how many, which wallets, etc., all of that is speculation as well. We really have no concrete information about anything at this point when it comes to mtgox's reserves. 


I think Mark is way behond foolhardy at this point. Nothing would surprise me.
In actual practice he was operating a fractional reserve, albeit for only a few days per deposit. He would credit an account with a dwolla transaction 15 minutes after it was authorized, and I don't know how many hours/days it took for him to actually recieve the money,especially on the weekends. That's why I'm assuming it took this long to put up a claims process - he needed all the outstanding deposits to post.
 
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:34:35
There's a rumor that mtgox was running a fractional reserve.
There's another rumor that alot more btc were stolen/transferred out of mtgox's own account than we were lead to believe.
It's all these delays and missed deadlines that are making me suspicious. Last night mtgox said the claims process would be up around 11pm EST. It's almost 12 hours later, no claims process.

All I'm doing is mirroring the 80 some bytes of mtgox api data to the server at a few second intervals. The chart is all client side, and by itself would have thousands of clients hammering mtgox for realtime data.  Instead of hammering mtgox, they're hammering livebitcointracker.com, which doesn't matter because all I'm really serving is a few dozen bytes per client every couple seconds. 
All livedata.php does is take those numbers that come from mtgox (that are on the server )and adds a timestamp, calculates 0.65%, and serves them as json, which the js chart on your machine plots. Call it from your browser and you'll see the same numbers.
