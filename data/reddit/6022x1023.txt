It's more likely that this is a small bank and the transfers are serviced by one of the larger us banks.  That larger bank is blind to where exactly the money is coming from, but they know it's going g to coin base.  That larger bank can't scrutinize the customers bank records because it's not their customer but the larger bank can be liable if they permit suspicious illeagel activity run through them.
If it was their direct customers they would analize the customers account and determine if there was any suspicious activity and decide if they we're okay with the transaction.
Since The larger bank can't look, they tell the smaller bank to discontinue the coinbase transactions.  If the small bank doesn't comply, the small bank wont have anyone to service the transactions.
So, of you want to hate on someone, figure out which big bank they are using.  Or even better, hate the government that forces the big bank to force the small bank to kill coinbase transactions.

Does this happen to retirement accounts? Its been like 8 years since I logged in to one of them.  I figured I didnt need it until I retire.  This sounds terrifying.

For me it's the same safety you get at a bank. I don't have to worry about physical theft or fire. I guess with an exchange there are other security issues though. The exchange can get hacked. My account can get hacked.
So assume you keep them in an offline wallet.  You have a paper wallet in your fire safe. Maybe you keep a couple of encrypted USB drives with the seeds. Maybe you keep the seeds in a PW manager so they get backed up off site.  Maybe you have a family member keep one off site. Maybe it gets encrypted and stored on Dropbox.
I guess that's my issue. I haven't figured out my secure and safe offline storage plan.

1,000,000,000,000,000 femto dollars.  I'm bitch bitch! I could execute micro transactions all day long but I'd have to use IOTA cause bitcoin would kill me with the fees.

So it's reasonable to time the market, sell now and buy after it pops?

Dunno but only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist so let's hope there aren't to many.

Is that site legit? People are requesting payment via cash sent through the mail or western union? It's either a scam or people are trying to pull money out without getting taxed.

So this is a joke? The company doesn't get your money so there is nothing to give back.

Glad I didn't get into that winning industry.

Concentrate and ask again.

That's why they created IOTA

It sounds like he is asking about how much money is flowing out of bitcoin and into coins like Neo.  It seemed like a pretty straight forward question. It also sounds like it was directed to People in China.  It would be interesting to hear a Chinese perspective.  What part of china are you from?

Do you have a reference? That sounds like something I should learn about?

We shall all learn the celebration of the bitcoin and as we pass through 5,000 we will unite in this beautiful dance.  People will come together, out of the shadows and the world will see who we are.

Any idea what's going on. Everything's going down except BCH is going up. Must be some news that I missed.

Can you elaborate?

You probably have to wait until it exists and trade for it on an exchange that will support it, such a Kraken.
