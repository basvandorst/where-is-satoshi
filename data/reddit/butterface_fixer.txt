Tonight at 9:  idiots take out loans to buy btc

There's such a thing as Faraday cages.  Most highly sensitive material is contained within them.   Solar Flares aren't quite the doomsday scenario you read on popsci

Here's a fact for you, if you bought into many of the IPOs in the early 1999-2000s and held for a year you would of been rich.  If you held for 2-3 years you would of lost it all.     
Enjoy making money while you can, don't be stupid enough to think this is a long term investment...  Nothing long-term is this volatile...
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:33:01
They ended up losing even more.   When you're already in a hole, they think digging deeper will save them.  Unless you're FORD or AIG, that won't work.

I can tell you would of survived the dotcom era if you were old enough back then...
And by survived, I mean, "at least you have your health" living out in the streets.

Stay poor?   Guess who didn't lose hundreds of thousands on internet monopoly money, haha      
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:48:19
You really think there's any difference between either of them?    Would you like to buy some AOL stock while you're at it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:46:08


haha   maybe in a soon 50 yrs
Perhaps you should try studying history more, rather than having to learn the hard way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:47:44


This is common, must be realated to being rocked as a child.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:13:52
You really think that wealthy people creating a stock option to scam oblivious people solidifies BTC as a legitimate recognized establishment?    You're just the kind of suckers they're geared towards.
The only reason there's futures on BTC is because is an extremely easy pump n' dump.   Do you think they give a shit that 10 years from now people will of lost everything over these scams?   Do you think they care about the people who lost money on the dotcom easy money schemes now?

By the US military.   Venezuela is not even a comparison to a global currency...
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:10:43
He's full of shit(as usual) but you too can start bragging about your billion+ worldlist now:  
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:55:45
Another ignorant fool. The world needs more like you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:10:56
That's how people tried to hedge their losses during the dotcom collapse.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:01:38
You loaded your Visa with US dollars...   Bitcoin has no value by itself, only what idiots think they can convert US dollars to it with.
Bitcoin's only value is its comparison to the US dollar.  It has no value by itself.  If the US dollar dropped 50% in one night, then up another 10% the next you wouldn't use it either.     
You can't even do realtime transactions with bitcoin, you can only deal with local exchanges you pre-fload.    Try to buy in or cash out of the system and you end up waiting days or weeks.
The system isn't a replacement for fiat currency, it's a replacement for previous gambling and illegal activities.  The only reason anyone other than criminals buy bitcoin is because they think they can make money with it.   They don't use it as a replacement.

Chase Platinum and CITI cards are some of the common ones that offer free exchange rates.
Give it more time?  The more years go by, the bigger the blockchain, the bigger the mempool, the harder it is for anyone other than huge corporations/Chinese Miners to continue verifying transactions.  If it ever does get more than the silly 3 transactions per second rate it's at now, it will only get worse.    It's NOT scalable, there is no "future" for it other than to go back to being internet toy money.
Make money while you can, that's all it's good for now.  It's definitely not the future.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:31:19
Sure, make your money while you can.  Just don't be a fool buying into it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:47:51
Your butt cancer is already developing
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:07:16
More like back when they were giving away free .001 btc for joining.  Any other questions?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:49:54
If you don't understand bitcoin then why are you even posting here?  Are you one of the idiots that saw it on the news and thought you could get rich quick?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:12:24
Guess you should show this to every VC firm as support for your next business proposal then.   The chart ignores how fast technologies die as well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:21:56


You have so much to learn...
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:02:40
You don't think a nice dying off of the population in big cities won't be a good thing for the world?   I guess you think your interhet monopoly money will somehow be uniquely protected better than actual assets.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:32:20
You don't have to pay any fees to exchange currencies if you use the right cards.   
You trying to exchange BTC to Euros or Pesos just goes to show how useless BTC is. If it had any value, you'd be converting Euros or CAD into IT to make the purchase.  Instead you're gambling that you can make some money off the initial investment so that you can convert it back to usable money.
You can't send anyone 1 BTC and have it in the other person's wallet within 48hours, even WITH extra processing fees right now.  You can only transfer money within an exchange that you're hoping doesn't go under, like Mt Gox did.    You're gambling with every step.   
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:56:00
Nope, an employee transferred the funds internally.  The company was created by ex botnet/scammers as a way to make easy money through an exit.  Shocking that known criminals from eastern Europe with multiple convictions would try something like this...  They surely won't be the last.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:10:49


A tech that isn't scalable, feasible or realistic.   Shame on people for not knowing how much of a failure it is...
It's a great scam though,  just like the savings and loan schemes in the 80s.
