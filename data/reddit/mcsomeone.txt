The price is an indication of how the market values bitcoins, right now. The market valuation is linked to bitcoin's value in the future, nevertheless if a bitcoin will worth nothing in 6 month it dosen't mean that bitcoins current value is 0. 
As long as the market price is above 0, bitcoins have at least some value being useful form of money transfer.
In short, the future value of a bitcoin does not determine the current value.

The fact that those countries banned it before the US, doesn't imply that they are not keep on banning  it today because of US pressure.
I don't say that this is indeed the case. I don't have any real knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes. It isn't improbable, considering the amount of efforts the US put against drug lords internationally.

I don't have any reason to think I know what the future will be like. However,  your post assume that the reasonable range begins from 25$ and ends at 100$, and I see no reason to beleive that is the case.

More reason to think he is just a manipulator. 
The exchange rate isn't what important for Bitcoin's success. In terms of people's interest and the actual available uses, Bitcoin's become more relevant from day to day. I don't mean that its success is granted, but its future looks brighter than two weeks ago.

I meant that financial ROI can not be measured as the worth of a college degree, because the experience of academic education have additional values. Those values indeed are not necessarily knowledge and learning, although acquiring a foundation of these two is a part of the value that any normal college degree CAN benefit you with.

Well, everyone, or nearly everyone, would suffer if it will happen in very quick, but this is very unlikely. If it will happen gracefully, they will still be in the same position they hold now.

It's only ironic that his claims that bitcoin isn't useful for anything is published with that article about those Berlin businesses. how lame.

Wouldn't it be reasonable to estimate that the number of people is actually somewhere around half the number of the wallets?
Many people hold (at least) two wallets, and you need to calculate out the commercial players.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:06:35
Actually I was thinking about wallets, not addresses. Now that you mention it, addresses to users ratio needs to be even higher.
Every user of exchange receive an address. these addresses are constantly changing. according to bitcoin.org it is best practice to issue an address for each transaction. I guess at least some of the users are following it. 
I wouldn't thought  there are only 100k users, but if those are the numbers, it may be the case.

You can guess that this was written in jest.
If someone said that's insightful, it probably means that
the idea is new for him. whether that's a well known fact for you is besides the point. The question is only if it's obvious fact.
If someone just heard the idea for the first and see it as insightful, he may find your comment patronizing.

However, most defiantly for some retailers it's a lot. Some businesses must work with very low margins. Besides, this services (at least credit card companies) take from bigger customers  lower fees. This adds to the difficulties smaller  businesses have to face while trying  to be competitive.

Tested on linux, zip won't open. Not that I thought anything interesting would come out of it anyhow.
Edit: it does opens, and it looks like a program for windows. I wonder if it's merely a GUI that looks like it's cracking Bitcoins while it cracking your PC or of it does it use your PC for Bitcoin mining.

This is weired. You can hold the view that bitcoin will worth either  0 or $10000 in the future but that dosen't mean that the same is true for today. 
Holding to your bitcoins have price, at least like any other investment. That is risk and suspending your buying power. The value of bitcoins is what the market say it is, right now. You may hold that on such price it is great investment, and it very well could be that you are right, but this have nothing to to with bitcoin's value.

You have no reason to believe that this is just stage 1, Amazon didn't imply that in any way. 
If you always thought that this is the biggest threat to Bitcoin, you can still hold it, but the amazon coins dosn't add to the hypothesis probabilty. Not more than Victoria Secret's gift cards do.
Besides, Amazon announced the coins more than a week ago. I suspect that the "news" about the coins apper now in two separte posts as part of the manipulations that this subreddit love so much.

This is pretty much nonsense, and you can summarize it to: Please, would you push the market down, I really need it.
Now here's why:
If you are one of those early developers, there is good reason for you being one. The reason is, probably, that this enterprise is dear to you. Moreover, since the next so called bubble (read: a fast raise in prices) will come sooner or later, selling now doesn't make sense, unless you really need the money.
Besides, betting your money on properties? You sure that's a good idea?
10-20 years for the prices to recover? who are you kidding?

You are betting the return of investment against any other investment you can choose,
I don't do rodeo's. I invested an amount that will amount to something nice if (and when) bitcoin value will rise. If I will lose all of it I won't be happy but it won't have any affect on my financial status.
