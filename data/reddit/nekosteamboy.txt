Still someone should find him and give him a slap on the neck....I only use small amounts since i cant spend that much and due to the waiting time my 50€ are now only 45 worth since i wait for so long now T_T

Currently there is a high load of high fees which get confirmed first before we (i received a payment with a low fee...) gets confirmed we have to wait for a sport in a block to fill up to get a confirm..... So the only way is to either wait till that spam ends the block size changes or well pay a higher fee (you can set the fee in the settings of electrum)

Well i didnt do the transaction i received one from a exchange ;) so it wasnt in my hand to decide the fee

Well 10cent "maybe" if its fixed and wont influence anymore and went to a first come first server type of transaction. Else no i guess just hope that it goes down again soon

I am using electrum so it does show btc/kb couldnt find anything to calculate it from satoshi to the needed btc ...

So if everyone would be forced to the same fees wouldnt it be just first come first serve?
