I understand your point(s), but I respectfully disagree.
Go to amazon.com with a Gyft card and tell me you can only buy a small sliver of things.
More options are coming if you research the pending adoption paths.

Interesting thing I just thought of: Before you hand these out, you can keep a duplicate of each of these wallets personally, then monitor each of those wallets on the blockchain. If they don't get spent within a week  you could move the coin from them back into your wallet. Pretty cool solution for a limited time cash coupon scenario.

On sunday I ordered delivery from my favorite local thai place with the Foodler app using bitcoin I had mined that same day. 
At least where I'm at, one can sustain life entirely with bitcoin. That is real to me.

On Sunday I ordered delivery on Foodler with BTC that I had mined moments previous. Basically turned electricity into food. Unreal.

Yea I gathered that after looking at his history. Thx

I understand your point, but that's the pitfall of living in a small city/town in general.. you don't get those conveniences of early adoption that larger hubs get.

Noob question: how does high frequency trading overcome the low frequency, 7 transactions/second rate in btc protocol?
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:54:04
How about cryptostocks.com?

This chart is correct. We are about 1/4 of the way into stealth phase. And that peak is about 30-40 years out :)
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:48:54
I hear ya and I agree with your perspective. I'm spoiled in the city. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:12:47
Awesome, keep it up! Let us know if you sell
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:42
It's up now. Sorry - a pitfall of being the first mover!
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:29:16
Just bought one! Looking forward to sporting it ha.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:09:30
Do it son!

it's the wild west homie. better prepare to back your words with firepower

Some sites already do this. One exchange I've used requires you to confirm/ 'release' funds after setting up the transaction as a second step. The point of the protocol is that these service layers be built for those who don't know what they're doing, but the protocol itself should remain agnostic to idiocy.

Ballin'! thx homie

Get fully verified in coinbase, instant purchase there USD -&gt; BTC. Then send to your BTC to btc-e address . There you can move between currencies seamlessly.

All those freaks trying to pump alt coins that aren't even on BTCe can now go back to their troll-box-less tower of solitude (cryptsy)
