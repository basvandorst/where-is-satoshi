Either that or prq.se

Should be both. Though Username/password users should be required to use two factor to up the security on that option.

should provide high res images (and/or raw files) so people can get them done anywhere. Decentralize the printing.

Beautiful men and we have a deal.

They are not anyone's business either.

Just force users to have two factor if they aren't using BitID. That way its  more secure and a bit extra work, making BitID even more convenient.

He is an expert in bitcoin. A bitcoin expert.

Their thinking is probably more along the lines of "why put bitcoins on a system that destroys everything on shutdown"
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:55:02
Im afraid that if personalities like Glenn Beck latch on to bitcoin too much, without enough noise from left leaning media personalities... that it will end up making bitcoin a polarized "issue" in american media.

While your probably gonna get downvoted a ton... I agree. Anything to get the public to be exposed to the idea of cryptocurrency and hopefully the basics as well is going to be of great benefit in the long run. Bitcoin cant succeed without the public knowing the basics of cryptocurrency, and of course different cryptos attract different people. (Bitcoin attracts techies and libertarians while dogecoin attracts the meme loving part of the general public)
One way I like to think of it is that dogecoin is the "My first cryptocurrency" while bitcoin is on the road to being the first classic novel of its genre.

Looks like someone is trapped inside :o

Dogecar was mostly just sponsored for that race. Though if Josh Wise (the driver) wins the sprint fan vote, he said he will race it again for free.

Technically yes, but its not as marketable. Ideally smaller denominations of bitcoins should have highly marketable names and be allowed to become the transactional denominations while the larger denominations can remain as is and act as investment denominations of the currency.  Base Bitcoins will never be used as is for transactions because it doesn't seem natural to the average consumer to spend say a thousandth of a unit of currency, so there needs to be an alternative face of the currency for transactions by the average consumer.

Yes, though the following naming convention seems better to me. Idk why.
    * 1 Bitcoin = 0.00000001 BTC
    * 1 Megacoin = 0.0001000 BTC
    * 1 Gigacoin = 1.00000000 BTC
    * 1 Teracoin = 1000 BTC

I get that, what i am trying to say is that SI units aren't very marketable and thus may make it harder to see widespread adoption by average consumers.
