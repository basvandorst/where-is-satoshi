yeah, except I'd keep the big doge round in top right corner, and just translucently cross out dogecoin text.
Also, if BTC logos could be made to contrast a bit less and blend in better that'd be great.

Why would banks be afraid of something that has a market cap of 7.6B? They can buy all BTC in the world with pocket change.
They can buy a mining hw company and put a huge R&amp;D into this and dominate mining. 
They can make it illegal. 
Etc. etc.
Why the fu*k would bankers be afraid?

Happened to me once, I've put a stop loss on LTC, but someone else must have done the same with big order, the slippage was 10% and a huge thin (empty) candle on chart. Learned my lesson about stops on an exchange with thin orderbooks.

This is exactly what they are hoping for. Bankers rule the world, and they don't like competition. Hence they came up with these anti-competitive rules again.

Good luck with magic internet money that noone cares about. Bankers will roll out their own, and everyone will use theirs.

This is not accidental. This is being clueless. I made this mistake  just once when I started my first online business. The customers saw each others email and got angry at me and CCd their anger to everyone, so I'm sure I lost some clients that day.

I wouldn't worry about it, apparently rubles lose 100,000x of ther value from time to time so these fines may be totally worth it.

I bought 0.1BTC worth of. Wanted to buy more (maybe put 1-2BTC into it), but the amount of hype and amout of coins sold I'm not sure its a good idea anymore. There is far too many speculators in this game believing it will be a major magical success, and I fear this could be devastating...

BTC-E is the only exchange, that literally 3 seconds after clicking withdraw, makes qt-bitcoin notification pop up on my computer. Mtgox took 2 months, still nothing.

This is my first real-world purchase. They use bitpay, and the whole process took less than 5 seconds (wow). 
I've asked the guy who runs the beershop if he gets lots of bitcoin purchases, and he said that not at all. Infact, he was surpised at how quick the transaction was.

You obviously don't know how bitcoin works. The point of EMP's is that all, but paper wallets or wallets on hardware in faraday cages would be wiped. Without the private keys (wallets) you lose all coins.

Whats the problem? Instead of being scammed by BFL you got scammed by some clone of it. So all in all, I guess you've achieved what you've wanted to do - be scammed.

how did you draw that line? (mathematically speaking)
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:12:23
They used the devices to mine themselves until it was no longer profitable, and than they shipped them. Not a scam?

Getting paid winnings in bitcoin wouldn't help. By the time they got a chance to sell them they'd lose 30% of value too.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:21:34
Its still a bad move. During the next hype period they will be left with smaller customer base to milk as a consequence, leaving them with much much smaller profits. Maybe they have just given up and are OK with being small, but profitable exhange however.

I have only good experience with BTC-e. The moment I click 
'withdraw' button on their site, notification on my desktop wallet pops up informing me of payment received. Its literally like 1 second.
Their volume is good too, but I never keep more than 15k there.

The only problem with doge is that you can't short it. It is consistently down, day after day. This would have been a great income (its down over 90%). 
are bunch of butthurt bagholders who fell for the lunacy of the inane 'much doge wow' bullshit.

How much did you send this time, 76 cents?
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:09:43
This is the first time someone has ever sent me a tip. Thank you.
$2 @_date: 2015-04-30 06:16:31
Yes, I do. You BIP38 encrypted the key with very long password, so noone will crack it. Congratulations, you will have you 1BTC in 10 years, but will it be worth anything?
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:05:55
You just lost $226. (assuming the price trend continues).
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:27:09
Tickets are non-refundable anyway, so it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:15:33
I never got any tickets. Their payment processing was broken.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:19:36
Thanks, I'll go to starbucks now, will ask them if I can do the 'airgap' thingy.
Can't wait to test it out :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:20:06
I do, this subreddit is just as blind to reality as Most people in real world aren't going to bring thier laptops and trezors to 'semi-securely' pay for $3 coffee.
Not to mention, in 99% of places you can't even pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:46:45
I was making fun of bitcoin security if it isn't obvious.
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:25:01
Like as if bitcoin isn't fraud plagued. How many coins were stolen so far?
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:39:51
Well, credit cards can be secure too. Write down the credit card number, encrypt the file, put it in encrypted volume on encrypted hard drive and store it in a safe. Make sure to shred and melt/obliterate physical card. Easy as abc.
EDIT: fix typo
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:17:58
Looks like something that you'd find on Android, not iOS.

Uploading an image to imgur for 2 minutes is a feature not a bug. My ISP thinks I should take a coffee break every time I want to upload something bigger than 5 bytes (like this post).
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:06:46
Well, fuck. I had coins there.

224Gbps can't handle my [internet speed](
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:15:27
Its not like its possible to do anyway. In my case, the bandwidth cap only allows for 15 minutes of intense internetting per month.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:13:10
I'm curious, what library did you use for charts?
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:19:41
What if all of this is already priced into the current price of $200?
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:17:18
No, it just means that the guys making the coin and their friends own most of it. So they are getting rich. I think thats OK, because they will want to get top price for their coin, so they won't flood the market, but sell only into hypes to keep price as high as possible and max their cashouts. I got em for 10x cheaper than they are now, so I'm looking forward to nice cashout too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:44:34
[when it crashes](
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:22:05
It would help if their site wouldn't look like something built by 9 year old in 1997.

haha, [sure.](
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:35:29
When I finished watching ticker was right at 1220.00, just as in gif...creepy.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:58:41
Its gonna be over 9000 some day, but its not going there in straight line. Sometimes, you take the profits and say 'thank you for the ride'. Buy back few days later during the flash-crash :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:41:54
I have some cash on gox, should I ditch it and go 100% stamp?
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:19:53
Trouble is, more and more people figure this out, and those corrections tend to be pretty small. Just tiny shakeouts, nothing too major.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:25:05
I don't care, I got these when BTC was $300 anyway. So tickets were relatively cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:50:54
Would you make a few for me, I'll pay you in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:14:17
Hey, I like it the way it is. Its so easy to send btc now, I don't wanna do auth. I use CoinBase as PayPal, only keep in few hundred $ and its my shopping wallet. I like being able to 1 click buy shit.
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:41:14
I started working on such project half a year ago, but I dropped it. It didn't make much sense after thorough consideration (at least not for game I was doing it for).
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:31:20
actually the next day I bought 6000 quarks at 2.6 cents. They went up 10x
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:09:24
Where did you get that number?
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:20:15
The problem is, everyone was anticipating the big crash, so naturally, it was just a small one.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:08:52
No, BTC will crash to 0. People will be killing for water, food, guns, medicine, gas...
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:03:54
Make wallet with armory instead.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:15:38
Could be daily limit instead?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:26:12
There will be more people hurt in bitcoin market than with quarks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:56:00
I regret every BTC I sold and every BTC I didn't buy.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:53:31
You can't just buy at bottoms and sell at tops. There is money to be made in between too.
I bought at 200 just few minutes ago during correction, and I have stop orders in place to cut the losses. 
There is always money to be made in middle, be it up, or down. Going all in at 1 price, thinking its bottom and selling all at another, thinking its top is foolish, and will not work.
Also, the current price IS the true price. Its what free market agreed on. If its in bubble state or not, thats not relevant to the validity of price. It just means that the asset is overvalued.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:26:04
No I wouldn't. If I sold btc, bank fees, conversion fees USD to EUR and back EUR to USD to pay with credit card would have been more than $100 in the end.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:25:32
What drop?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:26:36
To the other side of the globe, and back.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:40:57
hold what? the bag?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:58:05
Well, I was never planning to withdraw from Gox anything but BTC, so as long as they deliver on that, Im good.
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:13:51
You're right, its not a good idea to trouble inane people with such matters. Just give them some stupid junk instead.
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:41:52
Looks more like someones basement, rather than a bar.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:18:26
MtGox is a terrible place to buy bitcoins for core position (bitcoins that you hold for long term strategy). Its a place where you trade. I bought some at 200, currently sitting at 7% profit (7% profit in 1 hour mind you). By the end of the day, I may, or may not dump them, but I'm certainly not holding till 30. 
At this prices, bitcoins are hot. You don't want to hold them for too long, or you can get burned. I agree on that.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:48:22
Wrong, your gut makes you do what OP did.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:59:33
I sold at $20.
@_date: 2013-10-24 10:48:54
Yea, thats what I did (got 180), sold 200, I have some left.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:29:11
Its really important that you get that sorted out; and since its quite a simple app, it wouldn't cost much to hire a good frontend dev for few days.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:54:58
Well, now everyone can know. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:24:29
Hi, can I buy one or two?
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:39:02
Thanks for bringing it up. This changes the perspective a bit.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:10:09
Don't autoconvert BTC to $. Let players choose. And please, do make BTC only tables/sng's.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:39:00
+1 $ verify
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:48:16
I've seen it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:50:50
If this was my wallet, I'd let you keep half for being a nice guy.
