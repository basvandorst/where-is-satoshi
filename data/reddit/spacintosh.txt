Ah, I see. Sounds like that'll work well enough for me.
Thanks for the info! I'll be sure to let you know how I get on!

Since I'm brand new to this whole thing, could you tell me which exchange you used? I have no ties to any at the moment, so would be happy to follow your lead on that front.
I'll have a google of transferwise. Don't suppose they let me just pay with my Credit/Debit card online? Guessing I'll need to do wire transfers?
Thank you.

Legend, thank you! I'll erm... go try and do something with it now!

I'm very much in the same boat too. I love the idea of it, but I cannot for the life of me work out how to just... have a bash at it. 
I've not $500 to invest in it. That's an expensive curious peek. Now, with the current price being so low (by BTC standards) that's something I could part with. Just so I have one to play with. 
Problem, for me anyway, is that I'm in the UK and everything seems prohibitively difficult for me to get in to it. 
I truly want to be an 'early' (ish..) adopter, but I just don't see how I can.
A shame really. I've managed to work out how to mine LTC on some spare machines at work, just to see what they're like. I'm mostly just waiting to hit the minimum withdrawal limit so I can tip them in to a wallet, transfer to BTC then... figure out what to do from there.

Sorry, as a followup. How do you go about withdrawing? Just through a wire transfer to your bank or can  you use the SEPA transfer back to TransferWise?

Oh, from the sound of that I should just be able to punt it across using my Mastercard. 
I'll give it a bash. Thank you.
If I manage it, I'll be sure to return the tip!

Thank you. 
Whilst that is very much appreciated. I truly don't quite know what I'm meant to do now. Ha. I guess the incentive is there to figure it out though.
As an aside, and additional the my first post; can I use OKPay in the UK to fun a BTC-e account? (Does that even make sense, or am I talking out of my ring-piece?)

I think I did something wrong. The bot says the transfer was cancelled. 
Thank you for trying none-the-less! :)
