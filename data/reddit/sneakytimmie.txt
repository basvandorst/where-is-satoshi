What are forks if I may ask

So just to clarify. People with loads of bitcoin will bet on when a dip happens. And at that moment sell so much bitcoin to make it happen? Thus lowering value, some panic sellers will join in and these big spenders will buy again cheaper and repeat the process. Thus taking money from the betting and from selling high and buying low?

You managed to make 30k profit. I wouldn't feel bad at all. Had you lost some bitcoin though, that would have been a different story.

You never count your bitcoin, when you sitting on the toilet. There will be time enough for counting, when it hits 1mil.

Bro, you invested thousands into something that you don't even know just because some friend told you?!

You'll probably fry the notebook before you even reach the money the thing is worth. Sell the notebook, put that money into bitcoin. Just saved you lots, lots and lots of time.

Before picking a coin to invest that much in, do some research on the different coins and find a coin you believe in. I advice including Ripple (XRP) in this research.
