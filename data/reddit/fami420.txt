So when Obama printed trillions of dollars out of thin air to bail out criminals who literally committed the biggest fraud of the century 
That's just another feature of the system right
Never forget that's why Bitcoin was made in 2008

I do believe Bitcoin does have a scripting language that's rudimentary smart contract 
In theory anyways you could write some kind of smart contract to do that on btc's
But in reality someone's already done it and it's available for free somewhere on the internet

No that's not what happened he refused to lock up a single Banker claiming that we look forward not backwards
Which funnily enough didn't apply to me at my court hearing last week now I think that's LOL Worthy
PS Obama turn the two Wars left him by Bush into 7
Now that's my favorite negro magician
Also PPS I'm black so it kind of I guess lol but I did have my dad vote for him back the day only to watch him see pretty words upon pretty words
And him and his democrat friends have full control over the entire government for 2 years and they chose to give us are Republican health-care proposal which they rebranded as Obamacare. They didn't even put the public option in there even though they had full control over the government and could do anything that goddamn please
Just like the Republicans currently hold power and not doing everything they can to enrich their wealthy friends
Funny how no matter who has power it's always the wealthy that get enriched .

so Obama fixed it with his your intellect ????
So tell me how did the Federal Reserve bailout insolvent Banks without giving them money.
Please explain this magic to me, am too stupid.
And also it was Obama's job to lock up those Bankers who  literally committed fraud. He decided to break the law and not arrest a single banker. The American people put in there to prosecute criminals he's the commander-in-chief he has control over the Executive Branch. 
He said the banks are too big to fail, but where the bankers too rich to jail???????

So the Federal Reserve didn't print cash to bail out insolvent Banks or is there something else people are outraged about.
Or maybe you're the one guy who knows how the Federal Reserve fixed everything with leprechauns and fairy dust.
@_date: 2019-03-17 04:54:59
Oh sorry I think I might have taken the wrong economics class.
I forgot quantitative-easing is just cocaine and fairy dust.
My bad I must be mentally retarded I guess, Obama did save the economy with his sheer intellect.

Like you keep a saying child explain to me how the Federal Reserve, Bailed out insolvent Banks without creating new funds. What you're saying is I can have my cake and eat it too which is something I may have a hard time believing. 
Basically keto stop explaining to me that Obama and the FED on connected. 
Explain to me the exact mechanism by which this magic of bailing insolvent Banks out without the creation of new funds. 
You are the one who's making extraordinary claims I'm going to need extraordinary evidence.
I don't need you to repeat  that Obama and the FED are not connected which is a Preposterous statement to make in the first place. As the president literally nominates the chair of the Fed, and considering that at the time the Democrats have full control over the house the Senate and the presidency, essentially meaning Obama could have chosen anyone as the head, including an actual Progressive but he chose his crony buddies instead. 
It's like if you nominate Hitler as the surveyor of of Jews in America and then you're like, oh my God I'm surprised that Hitler killed all the Jews in America wow what a shock.
But anyways I don't care about any of this shit like I said, what I'm interested in is you  explaing to me the exact mechanisms by which they used to bail out insolvent Banks without the creation of new funds, aka the FED coming in and buying up worth less assets at face value lol 
The reason you keep avoiding the question is fairly obvious you are very stupid and I played along long enough in the hopes that you'll actually research this topic and get back to me with actual facts but this is where your gravy train ends kiddo.
Either go learn how quantitative easing actually works instead of just assuming it's fairy magic that magically saved our economy. You think the FED just did some heavy math and that's all it takes to bail out the economy LOL. Like I said you can have your cake or you can eat it too, but you sure as hell can not do both

That's because the oil production has has gone up exponentially I know most of you think that's a crazy idea that oil has anything to do with the price of dollars but trust me it's one of those things if you know you know and if you don't I can't explain it to you it's a lot of  history I just can't fit into some stupid Reddit post nor do I honestly have the time to
