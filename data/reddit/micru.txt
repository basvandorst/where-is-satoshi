There is a reason I said 'average person'. I have no doubts about the merits of the post-Soviet education system, having come from it. I know how hard-working and determined our people can be given the right motivation. However, I fail to understand your argument of how a popular (drug-fueled) music festival is proof of educated youth. If anything, your example is an indication of the contrary, of giving priorities to entertainment rather than intellectual pursuit, and wishing to live in an illusion of comfort covering up bland reality, which they would rather escape than put in the effort to change. Your example (immigration to Canada) shows that the general (totally understandable from a human point of view) attitude is that it's easier to escape to other environments, rather than to strive to change your own.

If you only knew how technologically inept and uneducated an average person in Crimea (and other rural, lower income parts of Russia) is, even amongst the younger generation. They are in an atmosphere of great uncertainty and fear. Something digital, intangible, and of foreign origin would be near impossible to implement. Remember, it's a country where a lot of people still drive a &gt;30 year-old Lada, and not out of nostalgia for the good ol' times. People will most likely do the whole 'drain the accounts and hide the money under the mattress' thing. Those a bit smarter will (or have done so months ago) invest in gold.
