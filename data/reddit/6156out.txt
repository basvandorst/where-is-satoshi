In either case, they are not running a fractional reserve system like what was implied.

You're coinbasing wrong. Transfer to your GDAX account (instant and free) and then transfer to your external wallet (with GDAX, withdrawals to external wallets are FREE).

Coinbase is aimed at the masses. GDAX is aimed at the traders. It's the same reason why Charles Schwab offers an interest-accruing checking account complete with free ATM usage worldwide, no questions asked. They want you to utilize their trading and investment services (where they make the bulk of their revenue). So by offering a service such as GDAX with no withdrawal fees and competitive trading fees, they are likely to attract lots of users.

This is a joke, right? Sure you might sell a couple of units but anyone with more than a tenth of a brain will google stamping kits and just buy it like the above poster did.
Imagine if you went on Shark Tank with this idea. I can hear Mr. Wonderful's reaction already...

Not that I believe the original post...
but let's say this indeed was a real scenario. You take it to a professional, and have him or her sign a contract. If the BTCs are to be found, the recovery professional receives 10%, with a catch. You get to monitor his or her work, even taking a video of the entire process. 
If the person is caught stealing or trying to defraud the customer, obviously that can be grounds for criminal and or civil proceedings. With such a high reward, I don't think there'd be a problem finding recovery professionals willing to assist. And if nothing is found, you have to pay double what the normal rate would be, to put up with the intrusion of the monitoring, video recording, etc.

Huh? Deposits made via bank transfer (ACH) are free. You simply have to wait 5-7 days for the funds to show up.
Withdrawals to external BTC addresses are also free (and you can even instantly transfer your Coinbase funds to GDAX for free). 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:49:26
This makes no sense. Since Coinbase owns the private keys to all the clients' wallets, they would not need to buy anything.
ANd then you use the BTC acronym (Bitcoin) instead of BCC or BCH (Bitcoin Cash). So do you even know what you were talking about in your head?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:56:23
Just total speculation though and most likely false. Coinbase is GDAX and GDAX is definitely not a fractional reserve system. People are trading real coins on that platform. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:52:53
It's really hard to feel sorry for anyone who left their coins in their CB account, considering they were warning people about the fork and their lack of support for BCH for WEEKS. 
And you shouldn't leave your coins in that account anyways. This is bitcoin 101. Transfer to a personal wallet asap. 
It is good to see that Coinbase is in fact doing the right thing. I admit it would have been pretty shitty of them to just take the BCH coins. And I also understand their desire to have a legitimate, bug-free and seamless interface for BCH usage. 
The question is, though, what if Bitcoin Cash's value is under $100 at that point? I feel like it'd be prudent of them to get something out quicker...

You honestly don't think it's going to break 6K? At one point in July, BTC was 1800 USD. There's a sell wall right now preventing it from getting to 6K in the very short term but make no mistake, we are not long from 6K being crushed. Could be a day, could be a month, but certainly "soon". 
Every $1,000 marker from here until 10K will be easier and easier to breakthrough, too. BTC's value is increasing at an exponential rate. In 2012, a movement of a couple of dollars was enough to get excited as a couple of dollars was a 30% increase in value. Now we want to see hundred, 200 dollar swings before we get excited. It's all relative. 10K will be here sooner than you think!

Whichever wallet contained your BTC at the time of the Bitcoin Cash fork, find that private key or word seed. There are a number of Bitcoin Cash wallets that can recover your balance from the key or word seed. BTC.com, Electron Cash are a couple off the top of my head.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:20:46
No it's not. Buy stuff on Overstock.com. Google local businesses who accept Bitcoin. Book a hotel room on Expedia. 
Not hard.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:03:15
I normally pay around 2 to 2.5 percent in fees. Not extremely low but not bad either. Much more anonymous than the platform exchanges too.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:28:24
I guess it could pose a threat to BTC. But if it did pose a threat to bitcoin, it would also pose a threat to any industry which relies upon encrypted technology. Banks, aviation, medicine, the list is very long.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:56:07
No, the fork was just in August.
Wherever your BTC was stored on August 1, 2017, you need that key or word seed. If you have multiple wallets, then to get all of your Bitcoin Cash, you'll need the key or word seed for all of them to retrieve all of your Bitcoin Cash.
And no worries, Bitcoin is indeed confusing. I appreciate when I get help too.

When you're young, you're supposed to take risks. At least the way I see it. The safe thing to do is put it in an IRA. But when you're 21, do you really need to be safe? You can bounce back from a swing and a miss much easier, both mentally and financially.
And you can say any form of investing which involves at least a medium level of risk is gambling.

Unless you have incredible technical expertise, you're going to have to wait for a software or web wallet to be developed for the Segwit2x coin. Hopefully there will be at least one or two options available immediately (there were more than a couple for the Bitcoin Cash fork). Those wallets would walk you through the process of recovering the Segwit2x coins, which will be done by entering in the private key or word seed of the "real" coins.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:31:31
Those people need to find better things to do is all I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:25:32
But how could the government prove you still have it? 
There's not necessarily paper trails when it comes to bitcoin transactions, and it's very hard to prove whose Bitcoin wallets are who's, especially when a period of time has passed.
The government will have a very hard time proving any of this in a legal setting. For that reason, I don't think the government will be investigating the vast majority of Bitcoin holders. Only the big whales will be intensely scrutinized.

I'm hoping my next available purchase date (next weekend) we'll be in the midst of a sizeable dip down to mid 4K or so, but if not, I'm prepared to buy at whatever the price is currently.
It's just hard to predict what the dips are. BTC could shoot up to 8K in the next couple of weeks, before a dip down to 6.5K. In which case you should buy right now. Or it might hit 6 and spiral all the way back down to 3.5K before stabilizing again. Very hard to know.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:17:28
This is why I use Localbitcoins.
Instant, paid for with cash, and LBC itself is a foreign company that I doubt will ever give the IRS any information short of a criminal investigation on someone.

Food items, particularly fresh produce, have always had fluctuating prices, depending upon the time of year, quality of harvest, pest problems, weather patterns, consumer demand, etcetera. 
Not a great example to use. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:51:15
Yeah, I would do that. Just as long as you know and have the key/word seed at the time of the BCH fork.

Don't see the problem here. If he really wanted a Lamborghini, what's it to you? His money, his choice, his car.

It's a colloquial term in this instance. You're trying too hard here.

I was going to do this, but being as I'm throwing in around $400 a week into crypto, I decided I was going to use the fork money to splurge -- backpack around Colombia for a couple weeks and find a nice tropical island and relax afterwards. Sometimes you have to take advantage of the situation we're in and enjoy it!

If you purchase bitcoins using "cash deposits," you'll find rates are really not much different from Coinbase, once you add in the fees. With GDAX, you have to wait for your funds to clear the ACH system, which can be up to 5 days, sometimes a week. A $5700 bitcoin might be $7K by the time my money arrives! With Localbitcoins, you will receive your bitcoins nearly instantly (any reputable seller will release the coins from escrow within 10 minutes of receiving the cash deposit). 
So I have switched entirely to LBC. Oh, and it's much more anonymous with it being a Finnish company. I don't even think they furnish any kind of paperwork or information to the IRS.
