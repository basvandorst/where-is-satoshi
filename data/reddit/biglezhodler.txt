I believe there are several projects working on crypto based loans. Interesting, have you requested to be paid in bitcoin? Or is it the law in your country to be paid in local fiat?

Good luck fellow hodler!!! I have a feeling this might just be the best decision of your life.

Bitcoin Badger looks like he is hunting panic sellers and Bcash supporters
@_date: 2018-09-27 04:44:27
What bitcoin we have in circulation now is pretty much all there is going to be. 
If demand increases greatly in the near future, which is what I can see happening as developments continue and awareness increases, the price will dramatically rise, rapidly.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:29:11
The comic does makes sense. The delivery guy still operates off the premise that 1 btc = 1 btc. It's supposed to be humourous.

BTC buys lambos. B cash lands you a Nissan.

Hahaha OSKO (PayID)....I have had funds frozen between my accounts using OSKO for over a week. Rang the bank over and over and they could not give me an ETA when funds would be processed claiming the system was having errors.
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:54:54
Hahhaha this is so true. Love it
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:23:27
I had a dream/nightmare that BAKKT was Bit main so they just mined all their BTC. In reality this wouldn't be a bad thing because supply would decrease dramatically in this situation 
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:25:31
OSKO fucking sucks. It's not instant and has lots of hidden terms and conditions. I have had money stuck for over a week using OSKO.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:05:30
I don't think this is the case. BAKKT provide BTC physically settled futures contracts 
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:11:14
This is very bullish news.

Australian stores leading the way with Bitcoin accepted as payment method. Now we need the government to accept it as currency and not as property.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:14:53
Of course you will pay exchange fees however this does not change the fact that you are reducing the available supply of bitcoin.

Let me give you a hypothetical. I am going to spend 0.1 BTC. So before I make the purchase I go and buy 0.1 BTC. Net result I end up with the same 0.1 BTC. How did I end up with less BTC because I exercised spend &amp; replace?
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:32:16
Commenting logical discussion isn't trolling
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:15:56
I do agree with you the current TPS of Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption. I'm not saying you need to spend BTC every opportunity you come across, but instead don't be afraid to spend any bitcoin because you'll miss out on future gains. Spend and replace is a good way for network to grow and spread out the distribution of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:52:02
only spend BTC when you can replace beforehand.
@_date: 2019-02-18 05:29:12
Isn't the whole point of BAKKT that institutions will finally be able to buy? So how could they possibly be doing that now?
@_date: 2019-02-19 00:10:44
of course. i dont know personally hahaha
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:23:03
Does anyone know the DCA method which has a relationship to moving averages? E.g. if bitcoin price is too high above the moving average you wait until it retraces

Censorship is shit end of story. Doesn't matter what people were posting to do with BTC, they shouldn't be silenced

At first glance I thought this was fake. That man looks much older than 44. But I'd have aged terribly too if looking for old private keys to unlock 1 million btc

" British officials are understood to have insisted that standard measures to prevent money-laundering be taken — including clarification of the Venezuelan government’s intentions for the gold" 
Probably the best thing I've ever read. Soon British officials will need a body to prevent themselves from money laundering and to clarify their own intentions.

But once you demonstrate the coins are timelocked you would have nothing of value for the attackers?

I wonder if Twitter will lock his account to make sure he isn't hacked and posting about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:42:53
They plan to offer physically settled Bitcoin futures
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:06:13
I suppose so or someone who threatens you with bodily harm if you don't send your btc to their address.
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:39:17
Excellent thoughts. If for example you were known to have wealth, would time lock hypothetically be a partial solution because you could demonstrate that your coins are timelocked and you are no longer of value to the attackers?

My friend, I can only speculate like the rest of us. But let's just say I'm not selling BTC until at least 50K.
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:41:58
Monthly contract volume stands at 6 currently. Does that mean 6 contracts of 1 bitcoin each?
Seems like Daily contract volume is still 0. No one wants to speculate on the short term it seems.

I always had a suspicion banks were hoarding Cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:46:01
I think 1 contract is 1 bitcoin. So in answer to your question, both.
