Smarter people than you have tried arguing this point and failed.

I'll write an article on it

At minimum: Authorizing an app to do this should force a password request and confirmation dialog to the user **explicitly** stating that they are granting this permission to a third-party app that Coinbase has no control over.
It shouldn't be in a bulleted list like those other permissions, it should be _obvious_ to the user that they're granting something special.

...Couldn't they just do a hard whitelist of around 60 characters and have done with it? (Then parse for things like "Coin" and "base" to check for people abusing whitespace, etc.)
Like Reddit's login system. The closest you can get to spoofing someone's name here is 0's for O's and I's for l's or 1's... (And those are still distinguishable to people looking for 'em.)
(Then perhaps selectively adding characters to the whitelist that can't be used to aboose, but only if those characters are *absolutely* needed by localization teams/etc...)

Unicode characters.




I'm sure hasn't had any complaints.

Most clients allow you to view the raw email without having to download/go through hoops.

Real talk. If they want to do this then at _minimum_ the authorization process for apps should become a multi-stage "Type in your password to **CONFIRM that the following third-party app** will have access to withdraw from your account without limit" as soon as any apps want withdraw permissions.
Not to mention any apps that want that specific permission (to withdraw from user accounts without them okaying every transaction) should have to go through solid vetting from Coinbase - at minimum they should be looking over the names to eyeball the "Coinbase lookalikes" scammer trick that seems to have happened here.
I get the drive behind one-click authorizations - for trivial shit like being able to get people's birthdays off of Facebook for your calendar app or whatnot. But if banks had a one-click "Authorize _[User X]_ to withdraw on your behalf!" screens you can bet your _ass_ people would be (rightfully) demanding that shit be removed, because sooner or later someone would come up with a trick abusing that one-click 'magic' and people's blind spots/ignorance, and making off like a bandit.

An 'application' that users could authorize via coinbase to withdraw on their behalf.
it was a 'phishing' attack insofar as that application (rather than a webpage) was dressed up to look like coinbase and emails were sent out claiming to be from them.

Hehe, I like you.

What exactly does this mean?
