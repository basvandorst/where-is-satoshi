I do, I run several high volume forum websites in the order of hundreds of thousands of UV per month.  Very busy websites with multiple servers.  Without sounding too disrespectful I'd say $100k per month is completely absurd.  Most outsourced code modifications I make, including complex ones, cost around $200-$500 US.  


So it's actually $160k/month?

Love VOS. The interac transfers are great! Unfortunately their BTC price seems to always be $20-$40 more per coin than other options.  It's starting to become obvious this is their business model.

We sound very similar. I moved to Thailand (Bangkok) in 2000 to live off my internet businesses.  You'll find a lot of like-minded people here. Don't forget to estababilish non-resident status with your home country unless you plan on paying taxes back home. That cost me a lot of $.

Jeez thanks, did not know about that sub!
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:19:11
Is it just me or is anyone else starting to detect the spin here?  I think the next headline will be:  'Nakamoto Family Sue Newsweek."  Not saying there is anything wrong with that outcome (I would be litigating too!), but the cynic in me is starting to think there is a fair bit of posturing happening in this letter released on reddit.  Or maybe I'm just a moron.

Ummm $100k/month for forum software?
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:33:41


Precisely.  So in the interest of transparency he posts this on a public forum and then proceeds to answer **not a single ducking question** he is asked here.   Genius!

I don't see the point as you can use a pseudonym just as easily on Amazon. It would take a subpoena to get your identity.

I'm interested but you provide no details! Like: how much the trip is going to cost, amount you'll be spending, countries, etc.
Out of curiosity, what were you doing professionally that lead to this point?  Kudos!
