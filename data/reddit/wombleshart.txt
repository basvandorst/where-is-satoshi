I’m not in the US, so can’t really comment. Bitstamp is very good if that’s an option available to you.
A word of advice, accounts are free to open. In this kind of a market and sector, you would be well advised to open several.
This, should one exchange halts fiat withdrawals, you can send the btc to another exchange and convert to fiat.
I’m afraid that it is wishful thinking to believe that all of the current major exchanges are well run and reputable.

Can't big retailers use the futures market the way airlines use oil futures (i.e. Hedge against future price volatility)?
As bitcoin ownership increases, more people are looking to actually spend btc. If LN makes retailer adoption possible, customers demand will make it happen (retailers tend to do what their customers want, particularly if it doesn't impact their business in any negative way). LN could be massive, so I'm glad it hast been rushed.

Bitcoin is not and will never be the only cryptocurrency. Everybody should get used to that. Is there any evidence that bitcoin is being eroded by other options?
There will be times when btc drops and alts go up. That doesn't mean that everybody should loose their sh!t and panic about fees and scaleability. The network is busy because bitcoin has grown exponentially in the last year. Let the tech catch up.

Some tech guys in high inflation countries now get paid in btc. They then exchange this for fiat daily or weekly. I accept that this is a minuscule segment of the population, but when it becomes about feeding your family these things catch on quickly. With the lightening network, any hyper inflation event in 2018 will be an interesting time for bitcoin and one of its headline humanitarian capabilities. Next time, some people may switch to bitcoin rather than usd?

Use bitstamp? To be honest, it's best to have accounts open with several exchanges.
Edit: I'm not promoting them or anything, but I know that Revolut works fine with them (in the UK). Convert gbp to eur and send by Sepa. Much faster and cheaper than via high street banks.

How could anybody have "lost" on bitcoin? The reason why we hear so many more "gain" stories than "loss" stories is that only a tiny percentage of bitcoin owners would be crazy enough to have done something that would equate to a negative position, in a market that has risen 800% this year. Imagine if somebody traded exclusively in Amazon shares and made losses. You couldn't do it if you tried!
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:45:00
Watching this chap has made me even more long term bullish about bitcoin. For a "professional futures trader" to be unaware that almost all of the large wallet balances are coins held on exchanges is concerning.
"Should I buy/sell bitcoin yes/no" Four questions that could apply to literally any commodity or asset that has ever existed. Replace "bitcoin" for "apple stock"or "lemonade from a lemonade stand". Truly sensational analysis.
This kind of attitude is common. It stems from "traders" convincing themselves that they are smart because they made money. They are no smarter than a chimp playing roulette, but they think that they and only they should make money in financial markets. Seeing "computer dorks" making more money than them breeds resentment. It is a big reason why the financial sector has taken so long to switch on to crypto. That is changing now though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:58:21
I like IOTA, but it won't replace bitcoin. Nine years is a lifetime in crypto, more people of heard of bitcoin than cryptocurrencies or even block chain. Ether is too centralised for me, I prefer Neo in that sector, but I hold neither.
What have the core dev team got to do to stop people doubting them? Scalability will be solved with consensus and when it is ready. Just because bitcoin has gone ballistic in the last 6 months doesn't mean they should rush the project. If bitcoin were a company, they would probably botch the job to "beat" the competition.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:51:57
Bitcoin has survived and thrived several times, having being faced with much worse than what you are proposing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:32
Without getting technical, when have the core dev team let you down. If you have bought btc, you have invested in a future payment platform.
Yes, it's a shock for people when they realise btc is slow and expensive. This they understand easily. Understanding the  value of decentralisation is not so easy.
LN will be released when it is ready. Not when alt coins moon, not when forked coins claim to be "real bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:56:05
Futures contracts are cash settled ie.not settled with btc. No actual btc will be bought (or sold). The volume in the futures market may be high, but those transactions have nothing to do with onchain transactions, which is just as well because the network clearly can’t cope with more volume before LN
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:41:19
I appreciate that it's a matter of opinion, but I think that the events that it has endured in the last 8 years exceed an "attack" by a corporation. Bitcoin is global and decentralised (not perfectly, but significantly), I don't see what you describe as a huge issue, as I can't see people flocking to a centralised coin. You would just buy apple stock?

@_date: 2017-12-04 18:03:42
The key is in the names. 
The "dot com" bubble was caused by an explosion of new companies that had no business, they just said "we are an internet company". Just like ico's today, ipo's went from a trickle became a flow, which became a flood. Most were junk. After the crash, the first ipo's proved significantly more resilient than the "johnny come latelys". This market failure and hysteria was about .com companies, and the rush to invest in companies that didn't yet have revenues. The internet was not the issue, nor the ipo mechanism.
The "credit crunch" was caused by subprime mortgage lending that was securitised (imagine emptying your kitchen bin into a Fortnum&amp;Mason hamper and selling it for £200). Nothing to do with the quality of housing, a product that continues to be in high demand, given that shelter is a pretty basic requirement.

Dude, every time Bcash goes up and bitcoin stops sprinting, people ask this. The noobs realise that bitcoin onchain transactions are currently slow and expensive. This is an issue, I'm not underplaying that, but it's not as if bitcoin is ready to be used everyday. LN will solve this. I'm glad people do their research and find out about LN, and it's natural to want it yesterday. It's due in 2018. If the world can't wait for it, bitcoin was never meant to be. My opinion is that noobs are lucky  to be getting in at pre LN prices.
I've seen Bcash pumps before and we will see them again. What coin hasn't pumped in the last month?

In the UK you can gift 11k to your spouse for starters. Secondly, if it’s capital gains taxable, it would be offsetable as a loss if it all goes pear shaped?
Personally if I had gambled on an unregulated computer game money like bitcoin, I would expect the gains to be treated as gambling winnings ie tax free.
I don’t think that there will be a sell off for the US tax year. People that are tax savvy have already figured out that they can pay for things with crypto to avoid taxable gains. They donate bitcoin and buy back with taxable usd.

Banks prop trade futures contracts to cover the exposures on their balance sheet. These trades are indeed in the tens of billions. However, this is very different to taking a position of $10bn in a futures market (i.e. naked shorting). They are just insuring an asset which they hold, or will hold in the future.
I really think that the futures market is a necessary precursor to ETFs (which will hold the underlying). The futures market will provide the ability of funds to hedge that risk, and without it ETFs are too risky to be permitted by the SEC.
Having a reliable pricepoint discluding fee free exchanges is also a step towards this.
It's surprising how hostile the btc community is towards hedgefunds. Yes, I know they are jerks, but they also indiscriminately love money. I see more and more people within financial services changing their view on btc every day. Bitcoin is making some powerful friends that will do anything and everything to help it, as they gain from it. Remember, it is the archaic banking transaction infrastructure that is about to be wiped out, hedge funds have little exposure to this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:42:03
The miners are the latest guys to try to steal/control bitcoin. They failed with s2x. Overcoming that challenge is the main reason for the recent price surge. Moneybadger did it again etc.
The Chinese miners do indeed have a massive share of hashing power, which I agree isn't ideal from a decentralisation viewpoint. However, China is a big reason as to why bitcoin has got to where it is today. Some are quick to criticise China, but a balanced view must also include the fact that they are global leaders in tech uptake. Just look at where they have got to in renewable energy. I personally see China's involvement as very positive. Also, lots of them are contract mining operations, so the coins are distributed globally. I don't know if there are any stats to show where they go, that would be interesting to see.
I can see mining gravitating towards politically stable, cold countries with excess green energy. Sweden, Iceland, Greenland. Why not the Scottish Highlands, which has access to some of the most productive wind turbine locations anywhere.

Plenty of people have tried to short bitcoin, it didn't end well for them. I know that hedge funds love risk, but when the opportunity cost of the trade is being long and watching it rapidly rise, even hedge funds will hodl.
Futures markets and not just betting playgrounds. Some will use it to insure large holdings of bitcoins. I expect that investment funds will buy btc, and insure their long position with futures contracts. Thus, if btc rises the only cost is that of the futures contract, if btc falls they execute the futures contract. Being protected from crashes allows them to be long, without much risk.

You could argue that accepting bitcoin would increase sales, I currently prefer to use a retailers that accept Amex. However, I'm not a retail expert. One thing that has crossed my mind is if bitcoin becomes trendy, a bit like Pokemon. Retailers would want to ride that train.
Point taken about the futures hedge, thanks for explaining.
If I were a big supplier to places like high street retail, I would already be looking at supplying goods priced in bitcoin. Manufacturers and retailers pay fortunes in account servicing and fx fees. Switching to bitcoin would save them heaps. If retailers are paying bills in bitcoin, they wouldn't be taking any fx risk in receiving it from customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:37
With respect, it's not "just a gambling product". Futures markets have real world applications, and are used to reduce risk. Yes, hedge funds use them to take long/short positions without holding the underlying asset, but that is not why futures exchanges exist.
If you knew you would get 100btc in 1 month, you would want to lock in today's price, to ensure you cover your operating costs. If the price of btc goes up, your only cost the futures contract. If it goes down, you have insurance.
I expect the futures market to reduce the volatility.

Yes, point taken, that's true. I meant the list price of a new one. For example, google is telling me they cost USD200k. As the dollar inflates and/or looses relative value, the car would increase in dollar value, but obviously still be 1 new car. The btc/lambo rate would stay constant and reflect btc value without the usd decline factor.

I can understand your frustration, I'm not thrilled with high transaction fees and a slow network. Hindsight is a fine thing, but I wouldn't put money that I need liquid into bitcoin. It's just not ready for that.
Nobody uses it between exchanges, people are using lightcoin (eth clogged itself up with cryprokitties).
With respect, it will not be too late in 3 or even 6 months. Any loss to the alt market would quickly be recovered with the release of LN.

I agree. It's another positive step and move towards full integration within the traditional financial sector. However it is not a case of Wall Street billions buying bitcoin and sending its price rocketing.
It's perhaps more likely that bitcoin will become a permitted investment asset, allowing all funds to use it as a partial inflation hedge. All funds keep a small reserve of a bunch of currencies operationally, no reason why bitcoin wouldn't be used if it's a major currency.

I take your point, but transaction speed and cost are variable over time (do you think bitcoin will not evolve by consensus?).
I think that perhaps you underestimate the power of first mover advantage in establishing a decentralized system.
At this stage there is no reason to think that bitcoin and iota would compete. They may well end up being complimentary.
Ether is something different entirely.

Current MLR rules (that apply to banks) only require them to report things that are very suspicious. There are fixed mandatory thresholds. It doesn't mean that they scrutinise every transaction of every account. The exchanges will have to report anybody moving huge sums in/out of fiat. I don't see how this affects the casual user. Regulation of exchanges sounds like a good idea, several of the good exchanges use their regulatory status as a positive sales point.

Well this all tallys up nicely now. Let me clear up a few things for you. Brits voted to leave the EU on economic and European issues. Leaving the EU prevents European freedom of movement. It does not reduce immigration from any Muslim countries. In effect, it increases the proportion of Muslim immigration.
That would be very upsetting for you, but not for actual British people.  The overwhelming majority of brits have no issue with muslims, as immigration is nothing new for us.
Over the last few years we have seen "news stories" about the Islamification of Britain, but it is entirely contrary to what we experience in real day to day life. Even our PM called bullshit on Trump when he started retweeting extremist content from far right groups. The British aren't very big on supporting far right groups. They are widely ridiculed here.
I'm going to make a guess and say that you don't have any Muslim acquaintances? I'm sure you're a decent bloke, just meet some and make up your own mind, don't have it made (hatefully) for you.

You are mistaking "market movement" and "demand", for a pump on one Korean exchange. See for yourself on coinmarketcap.com. When 40% of trading is on one exchange, and one ccy pair, it is fair to say it is "unnatural" to say the least.
There may be some nice people involved in bch, but their coin is being used in a clear price manipulation. Whilst the whole thing is damaging for the community,  it sadly comes with the territory when such huge amounts of money are to be gained. It's sad that weak holders are flushed out.
I have plenty of faith in the core dev team, who have proven their ability to improve and maintain btc time and time again. The team behind bch are simply not comparable.
Also, I'm sorry for calling you a dick. That was uncalled for.

1. Lack of volatility is not what defines something as a currency, even if you think so. Ask economics.
2. Bitcoin today is showing price characteristics of a pre mass adoption technology. It is still in its beta version, but is expected to become common within a few years. Lightning etc will enable cheap and fast microtranscrions. The dev team working on bitcoin have shown their quality, reliability and very importantly trustworthiness. If you want to wait until it's perfect before investing, you won't make much.
3. You don't believe bitcoins have any value. Fair enough. 100 million people feel that bitcoins do have value. That gives them value. Again, ask economics.

Large companies don’t throw open their books just because people question their accounts. They do however often have to give assurances to their counterparties.
I can’t see all of the exchanges allowing the tethers to be a tradable product without them being underpinned by usd (which wouldn’t be very difficult given the profits at Bitfinex you mentioned). 
From the looks of things they have created a coin/token that is quite useful and popular on trading exchanges like hitbit. They are probably quite chuffed with that, rather than being bothered about randoms questioning the capital base of their product.

Comparison to fiat wealth distribution is only valid if you include the fiat accounts of businesses, banks, funds etc in the total distribution. You will then find that the wealth concentration vastly more diverse with bitcoin than fiat.
The worlds second largest and fastest growing major economy being heavily involved in bitcoin mining is not as big of a negative as you think.
Many are still oblivious to the fact that China is a world leader in renewable energy. It's the cheapest in China is excess hydro and solar in remote areas, which is largely what the miners use.

I’ve seen some shenanigans in my time, my first job in the city was in a boiler room. Crypto has attracted plenty of fraudsters, but not dissimilar to the traditional investment market.
Like all investments, it’s risk/reward. However, to call it a Ponzi scheme is in my opinion horribly miss-informed.

I think you overestimate the research done by investors in stock markets and other asset classes. Also, this entirely depends on what $1000 means to the investor. If it’s all of your savings, then yes that’s not healthy. When people outside of financial services start taking out loans and buying on margin, (a la 1929), then we are in big trouble.
I personally moved some money out of high risk funds, into bitcoin. That’s only a slight increase in risk from my point of view.

I’ve used tethers on hitbit when playing around with alts. It’s a reasonable “coin” to swap in to, if you feel the whole crypto market is going to loose value, and you don’t want the cost of exchanging in and out of fiat (which I gather the Chinese can’t do anyway?)
I’m not saying this explains the minting/issuing of new coins, what matters is if they hold the underlying $.

Time will tell if this is a bubble or not, but to me it looks like the mass and global uptake of a new "something" that is currently useable as an investment asset, but is expected to become a standard use of payment.

Fair enough, you did predict a price drop and the price has indeed dropped. However, it is impossible to know how much of the recent decline (if any) is due to Chinese internet access to exchanges.
There are many other issues with bitcoin at the moment (some real, some imaginary). The Chinese fire Wall was announced over a month ago, I don’t think that is the sole reason for the dip. The Chinese are extremely resourceful people. If the want to trade Bitcoin, they will find a way. Their miners need to sell their coins and the otc market is flourishing.

Cool, thanks for posting. Was the burger any good?

The currency devaluation started in mid June
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:56:48
Stupid cash.
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:07:42
Where is this?
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:12:49
A sure sign that a project is junk.
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:22:23
That’s what it is
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:27:11
Free to the consumer, but they are charged elsewhere I suppose. Good points.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:42:57
I’ve always considered the economist a decent read. The telegraph is also agreeable to me. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:40:40
Fair enough. But I like skunks

Buy your children bitcoin.

Monzo is good tbf

What punks. Glad nobody was hurt. Your beefed up home security may have prevented subsequent (and real) home intrusions, so some good may have come from this.
There is lots of useful info in that post, cheers.

If you use a middle man, you can buy anything with anything.

I can’t speak for the US media, but I wouldn’t say that is the case in the UK. There is plenty of decent media here, and plenty of junk too. The express is well known for being at the shit end of utter shit. Nobody educated would ever touch it, unless faced with a bogroll emergency.
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:44:02
Shitcoin spam
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:14:06
I wouldn’t believe anything that this shit rag prints. It’s a racist comic for inbred, work shy chavs and it still has a daily Princess Di story.
No offence to OP, but I’d rather get my news from a toilet than the express.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:53:37
Shit post from shit poster. Yawn
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:00:16
They also neither mention bitcoin nor even crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:38:16
Somebody is a bit salty aren’t we. Bitcoin troll spooked a bit by the bull run? Post history confirms this.

If you say really random things, it is entirely understandable that people won’t know what you are talking about.

I cringed when I heard that. Gold has been valuable for thousands of years because it’s shiny, and can be worked into jewellery easily without shattering. I’m afraid that it’s utility is currently greatly superior to bitcoin. How many people would accept bitcoin rather than gold?
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:26:41
It upsets me how people get excited when the see a bitcoin atm locally. This is not adoption, it’s just a ripoff.

The world is bigger than Michigan. Plenty of parts of the world are doing very well thank you very much.

@_date: 2018-12-01 09:39:56
Hype, fomo and manipulation.

Just fuck off

“Cryptocurrency users were celebrating a fresh rumour...”
Not good.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:21:27
I’ll give it a go, thanks for posting!

Scam shitcoin. Fuck off with your day old account

Worthless shitcoin anybody?

Nobody is going to fall for your 2 day old account and negative karma fake response.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:37:42
The account was hacked years ago, you are spreading misinformation

Is it possible that Tethers are being bought with the issuers confiscated funds, and cancelled? This would be a way of deleveraging and reducing the volume of tethers around. It would be one course of action in financial markets, but I have no idea if it’s applicable here. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:34:34
Didn’t mean to come across as rude as I did.
Peace and love 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:12:55
Nice one
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:32:06
Some new shitcoin?

and the third party wasn’t visa, I think that’s the point here. It’s not third party free, but it’s an alternative to traditional third parties.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:21:21
Looks shit
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:24:43
Hey hey heeeeey

What a novel alternative to sending “thoughts and prayers”.
