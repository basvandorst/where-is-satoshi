Even if it's not your intention, public responses to your sincere question still would have the effect of exposing the commenters to considerable risk.

Actually, they were saying that my understanding was ignorant. Which is true. 7trXMk6Z made no specific points about the references I offered.


Define "sane" and "open". 


Bamford's article goes into further details. Judging his arguments by my quotation is illogical.

So you're saying that by ignoring the content in the references I gave you, you can definitively say what is and is not technically realistic for the National Security Agency?

I'm curious what you know about the history of the NSA. Care to share?

I did read the OP before I posted.
Have you heard of reddiquitte? Why not try calmly explaining your point rather than using caps and downvotes to communicate? Believe it or not, I am a sincere user who is interested in learning from my mistakes. For example, I have upvotted you because you have given me new information, despite your unnecessary aggression


You are aware of course that laws of physics and mathematics change over time, aren't you? Or do you think that the mathematical axioms that you are aware of are the only possible starting points? For example, have you considered the possibility that the NSA already has a working quantum computer? Or do the laws of physics prohibit NSA from making technological, mathematical or scientific breakthroughs and keeping them secret?

You assume that if it were possible, 7trXMk6Z would know about it.  This is not a defensible premise.
