you sure know lot bout it, redditor for 2 days!

Dude this sub is for BTC. 
I know a lot of people here secretly support BCH cuz BCH is currently a better currency than BTC. But doesn't mean you can post things that are not allowed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:14:06
Just remember to buy equivalent bitcoins to replenish what you spent or you'll be poor :p
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:21:47
To be fair that's misleading too.
Let's not stoop down to bcash levels
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:50:23
I think that's just his buddy jimmy escorting him out cuz he's embarrassed
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:13:46
Hahaha. You've taken the propaganda to the heart, "redditor for 2 weeks".
I'm not an expert, but satoshi did a good job. He even said that most people don't need full nodes, just miners or people doing ICO kind of things.
The SHA256 hashing is supposed to make sure the transactions of a block are not changed, so in my years of doing transactions, I've never had to verify the blockchain myself.
I would give you some links but seriously, do your own research. Read the white paper maybe.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:56:55
That means you run a BTC or lightning node ?
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:57:10
1)I do know about http, I'm a network engineer.
2) no one NEEDS to know about it because the internet experience just works , all you need is a browser
3)the blog you linked is about future when there are working lightningapps. Http is now (and so should bitcoin)
Sorry but your analogy does not fit.
I've read some of your comments on this post."paid govt shill Reddit" seriously xD. You're either being intensionally delusional or are dumber than a sack of potatoes.
I don't even like bcash but people like you make me sick. In any case there in no benifit talking to you so goodbye.

Yeah that's jimmy Nguyen from nchain. They're accomplices
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:00:21
That's just sad bitcoin is supposed to be THE money. When will we get a bitcoin useful as a currency :/ 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:55:24
This should be at the top.
TX fees are back to jan 2017 levels, why is op trying to mislead. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:39:33


not necessarily, we can try on chain as well.
we can either use a malleability fix to reduce size of transaction (like segwit)
or we can just reduce min_fee provided by wallets, which the protocol allowed to be as low as 1sat/tx 
bitcoin had free transactions in past before they were scrapped for some reason.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:16:00
I guess he meant cash. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:39:41


Then maybe transaction fee per transaction in dollars should be used for this post, don't you think?


Which will be too much for one small transaction, unless it is reduced somehow.

Unlike bible, there are actual upsides to reading the white paper (and any research papers in general) 
Sure lightning is good but it's just nerd money as long as I need to put up a complicated node to transact.
Hell, bitcoin should be easy enough for my granny. Years ago bitcoin needed only wallet to transact. What happened? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:37:31
Frankly, as a user all I care about what it costs me to send my 50 dollars to africa. 
So when op says "cost" and not "absolute value" I take it as the cost of a normal transaction.
So in statistics terms, median tx fee in dollars per tx.
But yeah, our views could differ. To each his own.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:56:02
yeah well I guess I should just pay the merchant $500 for a $28 service.
PS: transfering to a different wallet will consume the high exodus-decided mining fee anyway. is there any way out?
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:25:57
seems like organized FUD to pump bcash.
going to buy a little bcash, just in case CSW really is satoshi
