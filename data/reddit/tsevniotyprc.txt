No it's the people with power who do. They probably wake up every day with breakfast brought to them while we all slave away. If you look at the history of this earth it's all money that drives things regardless if y is better than x or x is better than y. Just like how Tesla was working ac power while Edison was pushing DC power. Edison would electrocute elephants in town with AC and DC power because he wanted everyone to use DC power so he would make more money. Tesla knew he had lost the short term but he won the late game because now all we use is ac power. The same applies to crypto the people with money will win the short term but the projects with actual love and hardwork applied will win the late game based on how good their product is for the real world. Tons of these crypto projects are a buncha DC power projects and even in school I was taught Edison brought power to us when Tesla was the one and Edison was just a theif of a businessman.

Yes but it is Ac power that is supplying the world so in other words you are heavily devaluing AC power.

I'd rather have Binance charge the fees they do because now they have created a very powerful exchange that clearly is using their funds towards making the crypto ecosystem a much better place. They are also developing a decentralized exchange because Binance is well aware that centralized exchanges suffer attacks &amp; recent attacks on Binance were covered. We are stuck in this together whether we like it or not but decentralized exchanges are the future. It's just a race on who can complete the most stable dex while having resistance to spammers and the ability to handle volume like we've seen in the past. Not many blockchains are capable if not any at this point in time so you're basically betting on developing your own blockchain knowing it will work or use another blockchain that you hope will be 100% developed to handle this kind of activity then build your exchange on top of it. If Binance's dex fails someone else will thrive &amp; the fees will be cheap but until then operating a centralized exchange you're just asking for death wish. Binance should be able to cover their asses with the advantage they just took which was supplying a good exchange to a community that is huge while being more than reasonable. I am predicting Binance will slowly checkmate other centralized exchanges by buying them out.

CNBC and in fact all the news stations are a buncha bullshit they've been saying to buy for months and that this is now the reversal.... if you listened to any news station you'd be losing so my advice is dont listen to them. I've been watching this market for 2 years and honestly I think it would be a good idea to start buy low amounts and start building up. The reversal is going to happen but this time it will be different because if anything happens like last December there will be too much volume and we will suffer again. What coin is going to handle the volume who knows only time will tell but I'd say buy low amounts and base your investment off what gives a coin value not what coin has the most value because apparently shit coins have value. Bitcoins future doesn't look promising and go ahead down vote me because you don't want to hear that BTC caps 5 transactions a second &amp; you expect this market to go over a trillion dollars. Good Luck... BTC has done it's job and the projects that evolved from BTC will replace it slowly because the idea has only been added on too.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:11:33
Yep just base of it off most people and the past market that is changing and growing rapidly. Do some math on 7 transactions a second it makes BTC a very easy target with high profits. 
Edit: Take 1 million people sending transactions all at the same time... That is so much time of just processing transactions on top of that how hard would it be to get a party of people together to spam the network with 1,000,000 transactions costing them 1.7 million dollars at todays rate to back it up for more than 24 hours. No person is going to hold funds on an exchange in large amounts and if the network is backed up well I'm sorry you cannot sell... What a perfect way to exit the market knowing people are going to be buying your bulk of coins. This alone effects the whole market not just BTC making this the easiest attacks on one of the largest markets.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:40:01
Yes and imagine your gold bars losing 50% value in a day and you're unable to sell them plus your gold bars could just disappear in 5 years. This whole market is a gamble but seriously BTC is the worst gamble.
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:49:25
I don't get why people don't do some simple math and realize BTC is just gunna get attacked with dud transactions all over again or just to many people begin using it. BTC is definitely worth its value if you're comparing it to a bankwire transfer across the world but the math does not check out for over $50,000 and at an evaluation like that some other chain is going to have to help it process transactions to later be written to BTC chain. Once a good dex or two come out BTC won't be valued as much as something that can preform 70% more transactions and that amount of transactions is still not enough for the the worlds daily volume(Your daily purchases). Since I began in Crypto I never really used BTC due to waiting around for 3 hours for a transaction and then on top of that waiting for the exchange to show I have funds. You're just better off using Eth or something more reliable because in the end this market is volatile and time is the most valuable to me so why use BTC? In my opinion the coin that will rule them all is a coin that can handle the volume of a DEX because fuck centralized exchanges they are the death of all of us no matter how good it is. Binance is fully aware and have prepared by putting aside funds for future attacks it's kind of a big eye opener of the direction this market and really saying something about our traditional ways of the internet.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:48:53
Do not worry it will always be ruled as property and they just fucked up by treating it like the stock market with gains and loses because everyone is losing so technically they owe us for our losses now. The rich with power are fucking done working and just wake up every day to spend everyones hard earned money whatever they can get.

Down vote me wake up to reality kids keep telling yourselves that its decentralized see how far that takes you.
Edit: People who bring real issues up get downvoted to all hell making this subreddit completely fucking useless basically like talking to a bunch of 5 year olds who know the secrets to the universe. Fucking do some research... Money and power could ruin BTC for all it is which would lead to a 51% attack. Enjoy BTC it isn't the only one with these same fucking issues and infact this same problem all ready happened to bitcoin private on a much smaller scale.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:43:30
Fucking people like you just don't understand at all and it really shows the amount of dumbasses in this subreddit. These are true facts and this is reality no matter how many down votes. There is no such thing as a truly full decentralized project at this point in time and any mined project may never be fully decentralized due to anyone just being able to mine. It's a broken system that worked back then but today it will suffer consequences because you can't guarantee that someone will not be the largest supporter of the network. This also doesn't change the fact that almost every project can be attacked and spammed with transactions. How does one stop people from spamming and how do you know that each person is using the network as they should be? These are some of the many problems and BTC suffers the worst just from those issues stated above. Not to long ago I realized that to back BTC up for over 24 hours it would only cost 3 million U.S dollars(obviously this is changing constantly) which in this market is fuck all but can affect the entire market just with that amount of money.
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:50:11
Nice decentralization you should look up the definition because BTC is not anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:18:12
It is not decentralized as people make it out to be. Is it more decentralized than a bank? Yes of course but no where close to being fully decentralized which in this world will not work due to greed. As long as greed is a mechanic in human nature it will always exploit great things. Majority of miners are in China and if someone with enough money wanted to crash it down they could buy them out most likely due to more and more people shutting down miners because of 0 profits. BTC is in the worst situation it could ever be in and it was developed by someone who could potentially be dead.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:57:37
Yep this is very true.
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:01:44
Yeah and it's like walking a thin line right now... how much longer will this go on who knows but BTC has an expiry date no matter what anyone fucking says because of quantum computing which may be 5-10 years away(Microsoft states commercially available in less than 5 years) will end BTC so quick it's not even funny. BTC is the grandfather and no grandfather lives forever. That also doesn't change the fact that it will not scale for the volume that the world generates daily.

Yeah when it went from 7k-22k people dont shut the fuck up but as soon as all the value is gone majority no longer give a shit. They all have no clue what they're talking about and always invite some retard on the news station to talk about price. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:48:01
You're fucking stupid I am talking about all the exchanges that support it and regardless of it being a scam or not it's fucking ruining bitcoin for all of us.
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:32:27
Then why do people still trade BTC... Hmm questionable like it never died. Not reading this stupid ass article.
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:29:37
Fucking exactly thank you very much this man deserves an award. Fuckin buncha retards out here investing in POW shit coins and I am disgusted cause no one has the balls to say it. As fast as POW was introduced it's already irrelevant it is now too late to be fucking around with that shit. Also another issue with "POW" is you cannot control who is the biggest supporter of the network. Money can cause a 51% attack and as BTC gets cheaper and more miners leave it becomes cheaper and cheaper to pull off but you have to be more than a billionaire.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:16:45
You will be the one gone when BTC falls because you will have nothing and everything you believed in will come crashing down with reality. Satoshi could be dead for all we know and Satoshi spoke against forking Bitcoin which already happened which has become a mess. People put time and effort into supporting BitcoinCash only to find out it was for nothing. Does that sound appetizing to you? Probably not and on top of that people knowing nothing about this space would probably go fuck that this technology is all over the map.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:36:43
I stopped using them after they wouldn't remove Bitconnect. Shows how much they do not care about this market and instead list scam coins like fucking degenerate assholes. You wonder why so many get scammed and honestly they should be punished because in my opinion it's promoting a scam knowingly.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:33:54
You get hit because its the conversion from cad to usd... and then all the transaction fees on top. Either way you're still gunna get charged a transaction fee and coinbase is one of the fastest ways to get bitcoin when you need it. I use coinmama if im not in a rush when they're prices are decent.

Decentralized Exchanges are the answer otherwise this is going to be a giant fucking mess for awhile. It will most likely be a coin with High TPS, Digital Identity, &amp; Quantum Computer resistance. Without strong encryption everything is going to get trashed in a short amount of time due to how fast technology is evolving.

@_date: 2018-12-13 01:39:18
People gunna down vote me but BTC consumes too much for what else is available today. Eth is also switching to POS.. Its a known problem and with no original developer around to direct us and openly talk about issues revolving around BTC you either believe in it or you don't. Vatalik knows better hence why big changes are coming to Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:35:08
I am sure you already know and apparently it's a shit coin. There are so many more efficient projects now than Bitcoin that one of them one day is going to pass Bitcoin. You wonder why Ethereum is converting to POS in the future. Hmmm it's like POW consumes more energy than you people like to talk about.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:16:37
Calculate the amount to spam it with transactions.. Nice 24 hour back up for barely anything.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:31:43
Research other coins some are further a long than BTC in terms of development. I believe it won't be BTC in the future. Those are my beliefs but since all these projects are open source anything could happen. Smart contracts I think are the future and also POS. I do not believe in mining and never did even when BTC was $20,000.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:26:23
Lol this is the most retarded thing I've ever read Btc is just as centralized. Also Vatalik is not a scammer and I guess you never did the research on how much energy BTC really consumes. It's a problem to the point where it wouldn't be any better.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:10:22
You can apply renewable energy to anything... Apply that to a POS network and you will have something that is better than BTC once again and more reliable because as of now it would only cost millions of dollars to back up BTC. When this market was at its peak many times BTC got backed up with pointless transactions for more than 7 hours unless you raised the fee. The fee went over 100 usd which is not really reliable in a world where there are millions of transactions done daily. This can also be applied to almost every other network as well but some have possibly figured out a way around this all together. The way to fix it is to make sure every person is using the network as they should be. If you can't figure out that solution in your own head then you have a long way to come. Hint: The FBI already uses this technology and have been for the last 5 or 10 years but it is not applied on blockchain.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:51:42
That will never happen most likely there are too many miners backing it regardless. The only way BTC falls is if a 51% attack happens and as the price goes lower it becomes more and more possible.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:58:08
Why dont you fools just look at other projects that are more efficient. This is misinformation and in some countries using solar power is fucking illegal.
