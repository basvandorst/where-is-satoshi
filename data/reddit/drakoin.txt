I think they should introduce pool fees (and if only 0.1% as a start) to drive some miners away to other pools. 
As said before, if they dynamically balance those fees with lost participants ... for them it makes no difference.
But bitcoin as such would win.

If I understand this text correctly, there is one way out:
ghash.io can raise its fees.
As a consequence, they will loose miners. That's good for bitcoin.
If ghash.io raise their fees in the same amount as people migrate away, they still earn the same amount of money for themselves.

oh, just checked. ghash.io has 0% fees. 
What is their revenue stream then? Do they live on donations only? 
Or is their main goal market dominance, and they operate on a minus simply to dominate bitcoin?

2nd last sentence "Finally, we thank Gavin Andresen for his comments, and Meni Rosenfeld for useful discussions."

So this "two-phases SPV / full" mining could give them their headstart (for the first seconds after they receive a block). Then when this questionable block is really valid, they just continue. If invalid, they immediately drop it, and restart. Could that reduce the harm they are causing?

Is it conceivable to add a service network which announces "block XYZ was invalid"?
A service that miners could subscribe to; 
or organize themselves, even on one of their machines only?
Could make sense if those instances are rare. 
Then SPV miners start hashing with what they assume (but not check) is a valid block, 
and when a few seconds later an "invalid block" alert is broadcast, they simply restart.
Possible? Wrong approach? Then sorry - I do not understand enough of this yet.
