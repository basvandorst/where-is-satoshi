It amuses me how Team Bitcoin try to convince theirselves that any dump has a silver lining or there is always a whale keeping it down. 
All the smart people sold and left crypto as bitcoin was surging to its ATH. Leaving the remaining people simply holding the bag

Country is on its knees but the sooner we rid the world of the 3rd world countries with barbaric and Stone Age laws the better. It’s all for the good of the world that these countries are extinguished and taken over with modern technology and law by the US and UK

The banks sure like suckering you gamblers in. 
Take that bait, throw your money at “bitcoin” then ask for a loan and do it again, COMPLY YOU MORONS!

At least with Cocaine your actually buying something.

But gold is physical, you can hold it in your hand, wear it, you have something to show for what you’ve paid for. With bitcoin you just have a bunch of numbers on a computer.

As it stands though, The majority of the world is not going to go through the trouble of exchanging fiat to BTC or LTC to pay for something that they could just pay with a bank card or fiat. 
Gold will always be in some kind of demand, it’s a luxury and shows wealth, very easily manipulated and can be sculpted into endless things, it’s a great conductor of electricity so is the metal of choice for a number of industries.

I’ve known and read about bitcoin long enough to form an opinion. 
It’s a really great idea in all fairness, and it’s magical to think how if the world adopted bitcoin rather than paper notes it would stop wars since there is a limited supply, where as a government now can print bank notes at will to fund wars endlessly. 
But I also think for similar reasons above is why governments wouldn’t take to it. Greed

I keep getting trending topics on my phone, and this was one.

That’s gambling not investing. With real estate  your buying bricks and mortar, something real you can see and live in, with bitcoin your buying something that’s floating around on the internet worth a certain amount for no reason what so ever.

I’ve watched a near 12 month meltdown from a friend on Facebook who remortgaged his house and put it all into bitcoin as it was near the ATH.
His posts started out as extreme shilling, something like you’d see from an MLM agent on Facebook. This died down as it was dropping in price and would start again when it went back up for a short while.
At 50% of its ATH, he began making strange posts, talking about space ships and conspiracy theories about the Egyptian pyramids being built by aliens, things like that. 
The last month nothing has been posted on his Facebook account, and I found out he now resides in a mental institution a few hours drive away.

Yes there’s nothing wrong with selling off when a coin is plummeting down. You just must be sure, the religious HODL guys will still be holding a dollar. I’m back into USDT for the last week waiting to buy back in still!

2017 brought loads of new investors to the crypto world. Many unexperienced, who bought bitcoin for the fancy name its been making for itself in the papers, which I believe caused it to explode up so fast. The whales have sold off at the top and want back in at the bottom, so I do believe there is huge manipulation here, and a lot of new investors have become bag holders or panic sold and ran as far away from crypto as possible

Bitcoin being brought to its knees here. Where could we expect a bottom?

Another test on support as you replied. It can’t take much more of this
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:56
Support being tested guys. This isn’t good.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:22:00
If this support fails, get ready for the free fall.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:39:37
Another support broken guys
