Have her sell half keep half. It's a win win.

Hopefully Bitcoin doesn't drop below $15800 before a get confirmed, because if it does I will have lost money on this transaction or I'm going to have to wait for it to go back up.

Update: After 11.5 hours it finally confirmed. 10am to 9:30pm
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:08:12
The longest I've waited for any previous transaction was about 80 minutes, with the same amount of fees. I'm not used to waiting hours.

Many years ago, 5?, I was buying a download subscription and they only accepted weird forms of payment and Bitcoin was one of them. So I went through the process to purchase bitcoins. I think I got 150 and used 120 on the subscription. So I have about 30 lying around somewhere. I've been looking for them the past couple years.

I didn't know bitcoin was going to be a thing back then (I think it was around 2011, 7 years ago, not 5). The remaining 30 bitcoin I had was around $20. I planned on using it on something else, but not many places were taking Bitcoin payments, so I forgot about it. I don't know where I bought them or what wallet I used. I was only concerned about making my purchase. I've been using the same emails for years, so hopefully its still somewhere in one of my email accounts.

Um, Jercos, the guy who purchased the pizzas for Laszlo, said he clearly remembers it being Domino's, not Papa Johns.

The mystery continues. "Will these conflicting reports ever be resolved? Could it be possible that Laszlo didn’t post the right images? Does Jercos have a bad memory?"
It is possible that Jercos has ordered pizza so many times that he thought he remembered ordering from the Domino's website, or Lazslo was so hungry that he ate one of the pizzas before taking a picture, then found an old picture he had of two pizzas (I can relate to this as I have done this before).

That's what she said.

Me at work. Just running out the clock.

Ramen in a cup or in the bag? The cups are like 4 times the price of the bags.

Are you the one who bought all my Bitcoin?

Whenever I've transfered out from GDAX, I've never incurred any fees. GDAX/Coinbase pays the transfer fees.

Is it sad that I don't have 1,000,000 Satoshi? I have 200,000.

You need to learn how to cut your losses. Use stop orders at the amount you would be okay losing and hopefully you can buy back in  lower. If it happens to go back up after your stop order sells, well you live and you learn. But at least you put in a failsafe if it had gone lower than your stop order price.

Oh also, put money onto the exchange, wait, and then buy. Don't buy directly from your bank account. Like you said, it went down during your wait period. Don't put yourself in a position of a wait period. Crypto can blow up or crash in a matter of hours. But I think BTC will rise again in the later half of this year, like it has all previous years.

A third and final thing, don't FOMO! Emotionless trading is the goal. That is all. Cheers!

When you teach someone to buy Bitcoin, you must teach them how to sell and cut losses when it goes down. Then how to buy back in.

This is high?
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:40:56
I knew it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:41:54
Will they have a BOGO sale?
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:27:33
Totally ruined.
