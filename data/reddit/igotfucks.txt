miners stopped selling in september 15. price looks like there is no potential to the upside. price pressure -to the downside- should come in soon. good luck!

the success of "the Internet, filesharing, tor, etc.." isnt measured by its value "going to da moon".
btc will continue to exist as a nerd playground with minimal and irrelevant marketcap.

next is that btc is the reward for criminals exploiting the extreme security weaknesses in all sorts of internet connected things (public infrastructure, companies, coming up: the internet of shit/things, etc...)
i expect btc to be outlawed within the next 2 years. exchanges will vanish and btc - fiat exchange wont be conveniently possible -&gt; marketcap a few millions max.

btc isnt a national currency anywhere. dont tell me that there is more than 5 people transacting btc, even on a monthly basis, in a tiny shithole as barbados.
of course it would be no problem to stop it instantly.
