Fees appear to be the same as on GDAX, from what I can tell right now.

You seem to be the only person here so far who's actually tried the platform before talking shit about it and assuming what it does and doesn't have. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:19:36
Not really. You clearly haven't tried it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:16:34
It's actually pretty nice because it's a hybrid of GDAX and coinbase.
Edit: Likely to definitely exceed the low bar you've set.

This is all your fault. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:29:00
What are you using ?
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:18:10
Coinbase pro has some features of coinbase, like it'll now automatically convert your crypto equivalents into USD equivalents, give you percentage of holdings amongst different cryptos. Worth a try before bashing it.

Based on sarcasm and a healthy expectation of volatility.

I totally agree. All I’m saying is that OP is apparently correcting a misconception yet there are just as many supporters as dissenters in this thread. Doesn’t seem like that was a responsible post, more like another opinion that can be argued fifteen different ways. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:00:40
Fair enough.

Well said. Will just wait and see. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:55:46
Doesn't really seem like we've reached a consensus here ....
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:49:20
Got ‘em !
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:49:43
Not too late to buy back in ��
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:28:08
Lmao. Alright. I'll give you that. But you've been warned !
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:36:33
I am joking. You're no fun :(
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:22:01
You must be new here ...
