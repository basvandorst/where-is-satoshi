You deserve it, I want a good source of information to know what is going on 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:36:01
OMG I get you opinions folks, I just wanted to know what is going on the devs mail and forks discutions going on. Just want information, not opinions.

You are buying huge highs, this is dangerous. At least Have a good strategy, if you take 5k now you can buy 1k worth of BTC at a time depending on the movement so you don't get exposed by the volatility. This is good days to take profits and not the other way around.
Ps: Don't take a loan, this is stupid. Save money.

Ok, I've though about it many times, but I don't like the idea of putting in a bank. Is there any threasure hunt method that only the person you know can have access to it?

She is just pumping you up, maybe she's only trying to say you should invest more than you do... Why not ? I have longterm and short term BTCs... Just get a little more agressive

First of all, have a good strategy, if you are not sure of the move you are going to do but you want to do it anyways just put less money in it. Define how much you want to play.  I went full trade in the HARDFORK days,this was the only time I did it. 
Man, trading, lets talk about trading. It is a market. You buy you sell, people buy people sell. Simple. 
There are a lot of ways to buy and sell, but never forget, there are people with a lot of money, they do a great difference in the chart. One guy can change it drastically. It's the money that counts, not the number o people. 
To understand this market you want to make a good FUNDAMENTAL analysis (FA). Take a look at the history, the matgox scandal, the movements, follow the devs in their mail conversation, see how China affected the market, how a hardfork affected it (July - August). Ask some questions like how many people have to own $5000 in BTC to have a market cap of 200 billion? Take a look at how the Indian market reacted when the government prohibited one of their ruby's. How Venezuela and other poor countries deal with it. The gold scandal is a good think to look at too. If you like you can search about the actual crisis comming up. See also how Russia reacts to it, the regulations and everything. 
Have good sources to the news, most sites floooods with a ton of useless information. Just have good sources, I use tweeter to get some of the news. Some developers and people that add good analysis. 
Next point : define if it has everything to grow or not, right time and conditions.
Next point : good time or bad time to buy, should I wait for tomorrow? NOW you do some technical analysis and there is floooods of BS. I don't like any TA in you tube or Twitter, but I learn their techniques so I apply it myself. My money my rules, that's how you make money. I remember a month before the hardfork of August, everyone saying "It's time to buy" they didn't fucking imagine the HF effects. It was the first one for a lot of people. Guess who was right? Yes, me! If you study about what's going with the code you an make money too. Don't watch Cryptoverse, he's the worst of them all. Don't watch Ton Vays, I don't like him neither, I stole his "time analysis" that is really good though. Listen to everyone, but the ability to take shit from what they said is the most important. I mean, take a look at the chart. From one minute chart to one week chart and tell me how the duck you predict 1 month in crypto. Some times I do TA with 4h charts man. Anyways, take a look at node investor, look how he makes the analysis and all, he is a good TA. But again, listen to your FA first. 
TL;DR buy the dip
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:35:08
Take a look at Node investor, he has reasonable analisys. I don't have one specific source of information to TA, but I do some good moves with simple methods.
TA is easy, the problem is when people try to predict the future with it and base all their faith on it.

You can't have everything Mark, but yes there is one thing you can do:
You say that you don't have many coins so obviously you shouldn't move them at all. You either pay for security or leave your coins there in coin base. You don't have much money and if you lose this money it is not that bad. Anyways you've choose to play at risk, so just calm down and enjoy your btc ride. Keep buying btc until you have money to move to your token. It might take a month or a year, but hey, if you want so much to store it safely take a look at some alternative methods to store it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:51:27
The best way to understand it is to buy a small amount (50 bucks) in coinbase and put it in some storage website like blockchain. You will feel how it feels like having BTC and how you exchange it.
Plan to store it safely for the moment you have a significant amount. Study how it is taxed too.
Read the bitcoin white paper
Search for forums and understand for yourself how it is safe
Andrea Antonopoulos videos at You Tube
Leave you coins in an exchange
Tell everyone you have btc
Go full btc with money you can't lose
Try to lurn about it getting in news websites
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:07:44
I get it, I'm a student too and I know how tough it is sometimes. Just do what is best for you, sometimes I leave half of what I have in an exchange because I'm trading. It is good that it's never in the same exchange, but even if I have a token there is a risk of losing it or someone stealing it. And you know what, dealing with money is pretty much knowing what's best for you. It's been a year I study btc and invest in cryptos. It is not easy as they say, I have a stop mark at 7000 to take a good part from what I invested in the beginning. If you're not an investor you should plan your in/out for long-term scenarios. Good luck my friend

Do your homework Mark:

Naah, study more important things first... Just watch his videos... Once you have made some profit you could do it, but not for now. You don't need to spend money to learn

And he has a course online

Ok, let's get to the point. The best wallet to have is a freezing cold wallet that you keep in a safe in the safest place you can think of. The simplest ones to get is TREZOR and Ledger.
Exchanges? It really depends on you, their price changes and you should NOT trust them. Or you can buy on Localbitcoin. Just register in some exchanges to see price fluctuation and make sure they aren't scams. There are sites verifying daily if the exchanges are paying correctly.  It doesn't matter that much which exchange you're using if you secure your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:31:08
I mean, internet stranger talking here, do what you want 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:18:48
Imagine a word file that has written how much you bought in BTC. The encryption is just part of the program to secure your file so no one can copy/change your file. Part of the program has a registry of who sent this file to you and assures it is not doubled. This is how I see it.
