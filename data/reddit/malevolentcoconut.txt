Would this become less of an issue with all of these big tech companies trying to provide internet access to "the next billion"? I think the government would have difficulty shutting off the internet controlled by Facebook, as this would mean turning off Facebook revenues. I think internet infrastructure, especially in the developing world, will improve and become more resistant to this sort of business in many of these types of situations.

I would love to see you try to convince the community to devalue their bitcoins to increase the supply

Quantum computing is still in proof-of-concept phase - largely unproven. Asteroids made of gold already exist - not theoretical. The distinction is that one already exists and the other does not.

Here's some napkin math I always use to think about bitcoin price potential:
Global Payments Market = $2.9 trillion, annually (McKinsey)   
Global Digital Remittances = $689 billion, annually (World Bank)   
Total Value of National Gold Reserves = $7.6 trillion (World Gold Council)   
Total USD M0 Money Supply (i.e., physical cash) = $3.2 trillion (Federal Reserve)  
Bitcoin Market Cap = \~$144 billion; let's take just one of these markets: digital remittances, the most obvious and helpful use case for bitcoin. Western Union charges $76 to send $1,000 abroad and takes 1-3 business days to complete. Conversely, one could transfer any amount of money, 24 hrs/day, instantly across the globe for less than a dollar over the bitcoin network. If all global digital remittances were performed using the bitcoin network, a single bitcoin would be worth \~$32,809. It is currently trading at \~$7,000. Now, start adding contributions, however small, from these other markets and I think there's massive opportunity here. Especially when empty investment vehicles like WeWork, Theranos, etc. can lure big institutional investment, I think something substantively valuable like Bitcoin will surely be able to do the same eventually.

I think how you financially categorize your purchase of bitcoin most determines your behavior in the markets. On my personal P&amp;L, all of my purchases were listed under "Other Financial Expenses". I think people that view crypto as an expense rather than an investment and consider it a loss from day one will have the strongest hands during periods like these where you can "lose" thousands of dollars in market value in a day. You don't see your overall portfolio as losing value, you see it as a purchase; who cares what the price is once you have it. This also helps to keep one from spending too much, as you see that money as gone rather than invested, forcing you to be more responsible about your purchasing habits.

BTC Bahamas, an ISP/telcom company. Search queries increased due to Hurricane Dorian. If this were organic increase in crypto interest, both "BTC" and "Bitcoin" would increase in tandem. This is a poorly researched article.
