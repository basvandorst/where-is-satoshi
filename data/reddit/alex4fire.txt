coinsetter aims to be us regulated exchange, but it is possible that this investments wont return, by this time the exchange fees market already has its major players and there could be new technologies for open source exchanges like Open transactions.

As I understood from words of Overstok CEO on recent hearings in ny, they will convert some part of their new bitcoins in fiat until they would be able to pay suppliers and transport fees in bitcoins. Bitpay allows merchants to receive both fiat and btc

If this happens now it would be devastating for them, they wont recover ever and 100% every one there would lose their money. MtGox should start withdrawals of both btc and fiat by the announced date, if this doesnt happens then Bitcoin Fundation should exclude them from members and release warning.

it doesn't mean more than for the first time in 4 years you can buy btc lower than the average yearly price and the fact that price is struggling to break the 450 support zone it might be an end of the downtrend and a good time to cover short positions.

The lovest price I know is on BTCE and lowest fee is on Bitfinex   (but for Maker order  ) so they are about the same. They also give some discount on fees for first 30 day for new users with referral code, you register with this code: FRAz9zihkR

If they are part of mayzusfs, they can also be in England, there are no clear official info on the site or else where. They have had a withdraw option in cash in their office in Moscow defore, but now it is gone. It wont be so easy to shut down the .com domain as the other exchange metabank.ru. If they are realy using Sberbank ( then it could be more problematic to deposit and withdraw now, at least for people from Russia.

even if due to some yet unknown circumstances bitcoin wont reach adoption by main street it would be alive for Silkroad type sites and shadow economy in many countries. Previous spike was partly caused by crisis in Cyprus banks

They can also agree sell it with discount as for a group buyer, who can start selling it on exchanges.
   
We have currently 5k btc mined every day, so this 30k can result in doubled selling pressure for about a week.

It is harder for them to convert in fiat, so large sales or buys require more accurate analysis and timing. There is no group discount from IRS, when price falls due to new regulation or altcoin opportunity they suffer the most. Large stock is defiantly an advetage if you have access to the insider information, but its not the same as hoarding.

Conspiracy theory, again?
