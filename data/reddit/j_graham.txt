So do you think you'll instantly cash out after every purchase, or wait until a certain time every day or every week to cash out? Im having trouble understanding how to compensate for the hour to hour volatility of bitcoin. Not only are you offering btc users a discounted price, but you also take on any risk of price volatility. Say you sell a game for $30 and offer a 10% discount to anyone paying with btc. So I give you $27 worth of btc for a game at 10am. If you cash out twice a day, maybe at noon and at 5pm, the btc price could change so much that you risk losing your entire profit. So if the price is down at noon, do you risk waiting until 5pm, betting that the price will recover? If you just cash out after every purchase won't the fees eat up your profit?

Thanks for the response. I've read that hedging your btc/usd holdings is a good strategy for small businesses to help deal with the volatility of btc. If you start getting a lot of btc business have you considered what % you'd hold on to?

Did you convert the btc directly to fiat or are you holding onto some?

Exactly. I cant legitimately offer someone a 10% discount on their restaurant bill for using btc if the price is going to change +/-$10 from the time they enter the restaurant to the time they receive their bill.

That's what I'm doing right now. I just have a bookmark shortcut on the tablet's home screen.  It's working okay. I downloaded the new app the other day and I've been playing around with it. It runs a little smoother than the web based POS (on my wifi anyway) and some of the features seem a little more user friendly. I'm going to contact bitpay, I'm probably just missing something.
