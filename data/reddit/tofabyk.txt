Imagine you ate half your apple with each bite. You would have eaten 60 % quite fast but you would still need forever to finish.

Bitcoin is not an option on wiki's donation page. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 08:28:31
Has been revealed how much was donated?
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:35:27
That was obviously set up to create suspense.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:32:11

If someone ends up with 51 % CPU power he'd be better off mining.

Gee, you sound like my computer science teacher who thought he would never have to buy another RAM since there was so much room on his 256 kB one.
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:13:36


Naw, you lost me after extrapolated.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:24:02
"Sir, you're making a scheme."
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:34:20


Reminds me of my Computer Science teacher and how sure he was he would never need more memory than the 128 kilobyte he installed on his system, back in the days.

Wanna hear my theory?
I have no fucking idea and never will have.

@_date: 2016-02-23 00:22:25
You merely adopted the hodl, I was born in it, modled by it.

Pretty sure the next dump of stolen coins is imminent pushing the price down to 440 again.
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:17:12
Not at all. I just think whoever has the coins wants to turn most of it into fiat.
@_date: 2016-05-27 07:13:46
Stolen gox coins turned into fiat, mostly.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:20:47
I think we're still at a point where any publicity is good publicity.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:05:58
We'll make our own Bitcoin. With trains and free lunch.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:45:35
I was at my parent's!
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:41:02


How about early adopters? I imagine they still have a few 100k waiting to be turned into fiat.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:51:16
this kills the bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:58:48


Define fun!
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:50:24
You don't really understand how encryption works, do you?


@_date: 2013-12-11 11:54:05
And good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:35:43
