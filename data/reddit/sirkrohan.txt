(I do believe BTC will continue to rise for the present and maybe near future, but he is right)

Considering how congested the network is, it can take time. I don't know how much but you may be able to recover them
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:31:30
You don't. You either believe or you don't. Don't listen to anyone else, 99% of people here don't know shit, including myself.

See you in a couple of weeks

Is this a parody post
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:57
I'm not gonna comment on this speculation because in my opinion it sounds a little far fetched,  but if you think even for a second investment firms, banks and the big boys don't know how bitcoin works or what it is you are being naive

What kind of business did you have at 12?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:13:21
Wow dude you are amazing, you really are making a difference out there. I wish everyone thought the same as you did. I recently got some gains on my lowly investment and donated to Alzheimer's research.
Please consider donating too - it is one of the worst diseases, robin williams killed himself off of it...
Anyway thank you for what you are doing. You're one of the good ones 
Edit: all the low key beggar posts you guys should be ashamed. OP is donating millions of his money to charity and you want a slice of that pie, God you suck.

Are you kink shaming John McAfee?
But no yeah, there is a certain fanboy-ism for sure

Hey bud. Call Coinbase, dig around they have a phone number. Bitcoin transactions take time, you can save them if you act now.
Also - enable 2FA when transferring coins, it's in your settings. Good luck.

i.e, op is smarter than all of us, fit 517k people into a single stereotype, lets all get off his lawn now

Greenspan as far as I'm concerned, has zero idea what the spirit,idea or function of bitcoin is and thinks in old school ideas and perspectives hell he compared it to the Native American currency. I wouldn't take his opinion on cryptos. 
Edit: this was meant to be a reply, my bad

You realize this subreddit is like, maybe 5% of the total people who are buying/trading btc
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:38:34
Nice bro, keep going!
