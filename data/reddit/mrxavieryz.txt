I don’t think the global banking cartel would have a problem making you rich if it meant the demise of a currency that could threaten the entire System
If they bought it all up only to destroy the currency doesn’t it mean it’s gone forever 
What’s the result ? Would the supply shrink to the point that it would never see world wide adoption?
Or would it just end up mBTC from here on out 
Could it be stopped ? If they wanted to destroy it.

You seems to be very knowledgeable in this area. Do you think I should buy 100 dollars worth and cash out when I double my money or hodl till I am a millionaire 
Also how do I sell my coins when I am rich do I just take the physical coins to the bank and get them exchanged for real money ?
When I do buy them do they send the coins to my mailbox? Also do I have to pay for shipping ?
So excited to retire early and quit my fucking job 
Thank in advance 
P.s sorry I know your probably busy won’t take much of your time
What kind of safe should I get to put my coins in ? I have a gun safe with a pin code and it’s fire proof and built in a wall behind a picture. I was thinking that would Keep it safe. I hear about people getting there wallets stolen. 
I had my wallet stolen once in the late 90s but I don’t normally carry coins in my wallet just usually in the front pocket of my jeans 
Why would people walk around with bit coins in there wallet. They are stupid. Now that I am thinking about it. Definitely keeping in my safe

What stops them from buying it all up ?
Prices will go up but is it not possible to hoard it all to the point it stops circulating and therefore becomes useless ?
