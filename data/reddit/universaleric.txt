If in a few years Apple came out with an awesome, useful iPhone then people would start buying it regardless of what competitors did. Anytime someone throws the "hurry up before someone else does it for us" argument I can tell they don't understand bitcoin.

I didn't say the backlog created demand but was evidence of it. Decreasing the blocksize would be contentious as well and wouldn't significantly help in further decentralization.

Then let them take over. Bitcoin is not something to be rushed. That's irresponsible and childish. Use fiat or bcash (in the limited places it's accepted) in the meantime. Stop throwing a temper tantrum and let the developers do their work to create solid, sustainable solutions.

You just refuted your own argument in the same post. If there is a back log of transactions and high fees it's because there's high demand. That doesn't mean we don't want to solve the capacity issue. But it doesn't mean there's a rush to do so. Also, people have been talking about alts taking over market share for a while yet it remains relatively the same despite all of the FUD being thrown around.

I'm not? Striving for decency isn't being a snowflake. In my opinion your position was weakened by your choice of language.

I'm not sure exactly what state of mind you are in or how serious this post is but please visit r/swresources if you are having any extreme thoughts. 
Otherwise, like others have said, take a deep breath. Regardless of what happens to bitcoin moving forward take stock of where you are at and make a plan on how you will approach each day going forward. Remember that bad decisions are made by everyone and many people will make a few really bad decisions in their lives. It happens and is not a reflection of your intelligence or your worth. And lastly remember there are always people willing to help.

I've been called worse and I can take it. Clearly any attempt to appeal to your empathy is a lost cause.

It's so depressing when people screenshot their own responses right after making them and then post it in a subreddit for karma.

Too much time was put into this.

Time preference and relative prices of other goods compared to total wealth. In 5 years time, my quarter of a bitcoin will (potentially) be much more valuable. Spending .001 of that on some other good will seem relatively insignificant compared to my total wealth and I will be more willing to spend it. Also, as price growth slows speculation will slow and people will start to treat it more as currency and less as a speculative asset. There's no reason to have that mentality now. Why would you want to spend an appreciating asset with enormous growth potential? Give it time.

I'm not sure which book you got but I would recommend "The Internet of Money" volumes 1 and 2 by Andreas Antonopoulos, and pre-order Saifedean  Ammous' "The Bitcoin Standard".

Heard about it from Daniel Krawicz, Michael Goldstein, and Pierre Rochard when our group was still called the Mises Circle at UT in Austin back in 2012.

Oh geez, I completely missed that you mentioned them in your original post. I'm obviously not paying attention.

Dude. Stop being a jerk. I disagree with most everything Ver and Jihan say in regards to scaling and obviously on this I disagree with voorhees as well. But you're being childish and annoying.
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:58:39
I disagree with you on scaling but you have always been open and voiced your views. Why they are all of sudden acting like this is some conspiracy is beyond me. I do agree your views on scaling should not determine whether or not someone should use OpenBazaar.

This is especially true as the rise in price starts to plateau as mass adoption happens. People will start to find the present value of other goods higher than the future value of the relative bitcoin. As far as spend/buy back the philosophy is the same regardless. Either you spend bitcoin to pay for goods and the merchants convert to local currencies or you sell bitcoin for local currency and spend. This is true regardless of how much bitcoin you own. Merchants already have methods of payment that work well for the majority currencies that people hold. They're not going to convert or add a new method of payment to accept bitcoin just because a few people ask for it. Once bitcoin is widely used as a store of value it will then start to be accepted more by merchants through efficient methods of payment like lightning network at which point bitcoin becomes a better medium of exchange.
