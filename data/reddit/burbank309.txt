Exactly. If this takes off, block will have to me massive. I'm hoping for the lightning network to be around before that happens, regardless of the maximum block size. 
But very nice concept indeed!

It is at least not trivial for a random stranger to intercept an email on its way. 
However, most mail accounts get hacked because people register at non-trustworthy websites using the same password as the use for their mail address. Any chance you use the same password for about everything?

I thought the priority of transactions was largely based on coin days destroyed. Wouldn't that make spamming the network like this somewhat difficult or at least let "normal" users have transactions confirming as quickly as usual? 
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:41:57
Yeah, it's really sad to see this happening on reddit. There are some valid arguments but everyone here behaves like whoever is opposed to raising the limit is a complete moron. IMO it's tricky not to mess up the entire system and this is for sure a topic worthy of a more civilized and substantial discussion.

Software engineers hate redundancy, so that is probably why this isn't in the protocol. Anyway: What's a good reason for anyone to manually create a raw transaction? I've never done that and never felt the need. A wallet should be able to handle all that for you...
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:43:21
Then the wallet is bad. It should explicitly display the fee you are paying and warn you before paying exceptionally large fees.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:14:06
Yes, but an intermediary present on both chains could do that. Like a service specialising in transfer between two side chains. Great catch OP btw!

P2pool clusters are a lot like mining pools, that's true. However, the advantage is that p2pool minimizes the variance. Large variance has made many miners join larger pools with less variance. Thus, rising p2pool participation will help smaller pools compete with the larger ones.

Off-Topic: Has nLockTime even been implemented yet? Last time I tried to experiment with it, it wasn't part of the implementation.

Interesting read. I am no expert on crypto currencies and don't know a lot about darkcoin, but here is what I think:
A key to the security is the moasternode_vin. If I am not mistaken, the vin is the hash corresponding to the output of the coin a node has to hold to become a masternode. As I see it, someone could send the 1000 required coin to himself and generate a new hash every time. That way, an attacker could get a number of nodes, that are reasonably close to each other (in regards of "hash distance"). The attacker could now wait for the hash of the current block hash (called n2 in the paper) to be near his cluster and he will likely have a majority for the voting process. This would make the system vulnerable to sybil attacks.

However, if you broadcast your transaction to the network, an attacker with a QC could see the transaction, containing the public key. Assuming the QC is able to break the key before the transaction makes it into the blockchain, he could broadcast a different transaction and that one may win (for example because the miner that finds the next block prioritizes competing transactions by the transaction fee payed).

Can we start using scientific notation for cases like this please?

I use that, too. One question though for the experts in here: I used the app to generate the seed (the 12 words you have to remember). However, is the random number generator in iOS devices ok for that or should I rather create a wallet on my computer and use that in hive?
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:05:49
Thats why you write automated tests
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:43:53
Hmm are you shure? To me it seems like core functionality and the displaying of data are not separated in the way they should be, which is a bad thing.
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:18:22
Semi off-topic: The difficulty changes every 2016 blocks based on how fast the last 2016 blocks have been mined. For that reason and the fact, that hash rate is usually increasing, the average time between blocks is lower than intended which is not a problem. However, problems arise when the network hash rate drops (resulting in very long times between blocks), as has happened to some altcoins. So I am wondering, why the hash rate is not recalculated after every block that has been found, based on he last 2016 blocks. That way, in case of a massive drop of hash power, the difficulty would decrease faster. Also there would not be difficulty jumps like this.
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:52:29
It is sepcified, but it isn't implemented, is it? I experimented quite a while back with this feature on the testnet, but all my transactions would go right into the blockchain and were not replaceable, if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:54:57
This may be slightly off topic, but part of the problem is smaller pools closing. I read at least about one pool closing because the variance was too high for them. 
But couldn't small pools mine on p2pool as well, and thus sparing their miners the hassle to run their own full node and also reducing the high variance they experience when mining just on the actual block chain?
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:02:28
We should probably use a logarithmic scale to the base 2 though because of moores law
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:29:22

It has been reported, that incoming connections only come in on the default port. You can run more than one node behind one IP, but there will be no benefit to the network. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:35:14
Did anyone ever ask why?
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:21:57
You can however premine some consecutive blocks in the future and take the reward.
Imagine this: an attacker in 2050 finds a way to travel time and will come back to jan 16th 2015. Before traveling, he could mine some consecutive blocks following one "legitimate" block, that was mined in 2015. Using time stamps sufficiently close to each other, he could make sure his blocks will build the longest chain.
He could even include valid transactions, although there is a danger to it, as someone's decision to spend coins could have changed due to the impact he has on the new version of the timeline.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:02:52
You can easily simulate it. Your 10k won't move the market a lot, so just write down when you would have bought and sold and do the math. You will likely notice, that it is not so easy.

You can use the library for other things than SSL. Also there are other things the library does than SSL. The bug they found did not affect SSL at all.

There was discussion about embedding the UTXO set every so many blocks into the chain. Does anyone know what happened to that idea?
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:23:08
You are probably right, I don't know too much about economics. This idea came to my mind as a way to make Bitcoin non-deflationary. Paying the miners all the inflation would mean investing the entire monetary growth into cracking SHA256 hashes, which does not seem reasonable to me.

Couldn't the address space be clustered, so that a server only needs to take a fraction of the addresses into account? A client would need to use multiple server that way...

Ill just leave this here: 
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:48:37
Does it really? Isn't coin days destroyed the product of the amount and the age of the UTXOs? Then it wouldn't matter how many UTXOs you spend, you still get the same amount of "interest". Also spending more more frequently or less frequently would yield the same output. More digits might me required though...

I am probably the dumb one here but the point is, that it can't be guaranteed that a transaction makes it onto the chain. And I am trying to understand how the LN deals with that fact...
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:38:00
It would not necessarily have to be paid to the miners. You could make it so that a transaction pays interest, depending on the coin days destroyed.
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:25:08
By the same logic you could argue, that you need career economists for the economic side of bitcoin.

But if you provide incentive to miners to not include the transaction with higher priority into the chain, the money won't be gone 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:24:51
Is it completely safe? What about this scenario:
Sally is very rich and wants to screw Johnny over because of personal differences. She can broadcast her version of the transaction, that cannot be included into the blockchain yet, and also broadcasts a second transaction depending on the first. The second transaction has a very high fee. Doesn't that give the incentive to miners to not include whatever Johnny broadcasts (who is not rich enough to compete with the fee) and hope to mine the first block in which Sallys transactions can be included?
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:53:29
If you want to hold Bitcoin until a certain date, but you don't trust yourself to remain calm until then you can use this to lock Bitcoin up. These Bitcoin can then only be moved after the set date has passed.

You have a point. But there are other ways to handle the risk. My bank in Germany halted my transfer to MtGox and called me the next morning to confirm the transaction. This money is converted to bitcoin by now.

It looks like blockchain.info didnt see some of these transactions before they appeared in the block.What do you think about that? Might be a glitch on the blockchain.info site, but I think it could also be a hint, that the miner who found the block is the owner of these coins and didnt broadcast the transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:11:57
The block the transacrion made it into is from 4:44:50 while they claim they have seen the transaction only at 5:04. Note that it also says +-19 minutes. Usually they first see the transaction and it makes it to a block later.
