I did a bunch of bip39 wallet restoration testing to prepare for a talk I'm giving on Bitcoin and found that of the popular wallets only a few support the BIP-39/BIP-44 combination necessary to make them cross compatible.
The biggest problem in this space is electrum, which supports the BIP-39 wordlist but doesn't use BIP-44 in its generation which seems to cause a lot of confusion.
Some wallets seem to use BIP-39 but aren't HD wallets which causes further confusion, and given the fracturing of the standard outside of hardware wallets I'm hesitant to even call it future proof at this point.
In my opinion the only safe option for backup is to backup everything in multiple formats supported by multiple devices and re-evaluate your backup method every 6 months to 1 year to make sure it's ok.
If you're going with the BIP-39 wordlist + BIP-44 HD wallet at very least you have the Mycelium, Copay, Samourai, Trezor, Ledger ecosystem supporting you. Just make sure they're still around when the wordlist based seed becomes important.

I ordered 3 weeks ago and it was not an option. My order ended up being delayed presumably due to high demand and their support staff was incredibly helpful offering me options to resolve the issue.
Shortly after my problems were resolved I noticed this on their website (since I was watching it every few hours out of excitement, or maybe worry for my order), so I can confirm it's a new option.

Happy to help. After speaking with them both on Reddit and via e-mail their staff very much does not seem the type to run a scam like that. In all honesty my interactions with them online have very likely made me a permanent booster for them. They really went above and beyond in responding to my many e-mails, tweets, and support requests, and I believe they deserve recognition for that.
