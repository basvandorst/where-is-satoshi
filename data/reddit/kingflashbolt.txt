In case you guys have not yet noticed, he’s trolling the absolute idiots who think Bitcoin is a 100% safe investment. When words such as, “definitely” or “double your money” are spammed, the only people doubling their money are the ones who got the regular folks like some of you to buy in. Congrats - some Instagram pro who you follow sold his BTC for $20,000 and you bought in at that price. You just made them money!

It’s funny that you decide to post this when Bitcoin is declining in value. There is no necessity for Bitcoin but that is measly your ONLY argument as to why Bitcoin has value. The plausible scenario is you want your Bitcoin and cryptobuddies to get some sort of legislation to back them because that would drive the value of Bitcoin higher. Sadly, no one cares. The majority of Bitcoin holders who have the power to sway movement have already made their money and the rest of you sweating over 2% of a Bitcoin will then need to find something else to talk about.

So please, in your defense, explain what me asking “What is Bitcoin” have anything to do with this thread. It’s more likely you tried to use that as some sort of defensive reply to heighten your artificial ego because you do not have a legitimate response to what I said.

Lol. I cringe at these posts. There are very few people who actually use Bitcoin as currency. The ones who are telling you it is the future of currency are 1) Truly passionate about BTC or 2) Pumping and dumping. I can’t wait for financial statements to start including sales contributed via Bitcoin payments. It is not going to be a high number.

Oh, kids. Please don’t use words that you have no meaning of and stop thinking investing in BTC makes you a finance professional. A dip is a small pullback of a few percentage points. This isn’t a dip - it is a crash. If 50% is a dip to you, you are an absolute idiot.

I love when some Starbucks employee gets on Reddit trying to use their revolutionist past to explain the future. Bitcoin isn’t an investment. There are no financials involved that you can base the past and try to reflect the future based on it. If you bought Bitcoin, you better have a strong stomach. As quick as it goes up, it can drop twice as quick.

1) You are deflecting. I wanted to know what Reddit’s impression of Bitcoin is and an explanation. Around that time, I had just begun using Reddit and felt compelled to ask a question about Bitcoin. I could easily have Googled it, though.
2) I could go search your post history but I didn’t. Why? Cause I don’t deflect. Me searching “What is Bitcoin” is actually quite legitimate. In your own words, Tammy, I guarantee you would not be able to properly explain Bitcoin and its properties. I don’t blame you. Tammy wants to make money. Unfortunately, I am just telling you, a 50% drop in “value” is not a dip. 
Anyways, there is nothing to entertain here. Your objective is to be a detective and look up a user’s content rather than being informed. I see zero legitimate arguments made from you.

Summary: I was bragging to John and Becky (who I have a huge crush on but she likes John more) about my Bitcoin gAinZ but now that it is sinking, I am too stubborn to admit that they may have been right.

When BTC “investors” think they understand the financial market. Warren Buffett, which you can’t even spell correctly, does not invest in dips. He invests when he sees undervalued companies.

Lol. Please don’t compare gold to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:45:46
That’s a moot argument from a salty person such as yourself. I asked that question, correct. And?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:43:34
Lmao, I can’t wait for the protests outside White House and Congress when you kids lose your money. Now they want the government to come save Bitcoin... lmfao?

Stock is $100.
Goes up 500%.
Is worth $500.
Stock drops 50%. 
Is worth $250.
It's much more difficult to recover from a correction.
