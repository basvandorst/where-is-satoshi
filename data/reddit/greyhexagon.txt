Well Eric Andre in general, but making someone so uncomfortable and disgusted that they have to leave the interview is gold.

My mum was given a questionnaire by her bank that said it would take "around 30 mins" to fill out online. Bare in mind that she's not very tech literate so it would probably take about an hour. Needless to say she didn't fill it out, so the bank shut her account!

HSBC I think
It was a business account as she runs a small one-person business. Her theory is that they were trying to get rid of business accounts that don't bring in lots of money and penalising people who don't take surveys is the excuse for shutting them down

I'm relatively new to this, so may be wrong, but how can signing up to something like this actually make you money? 
The company itself has to make a margin, so wouldn't you make more just mining yourself? 
Not to mention the average PC won't earn more than power consumption costs
