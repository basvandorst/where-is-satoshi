The thing is, she works damn hard. And right now she is working on 'blockchain'. That's gonna be a *whole* hell of a lot of time, effort and money poured into wrangling this whole experiment into a new financial service, which will likely make her a virtual shitton of money.

I'm assuming you're a middle-aged American with a job and semi-diversified investment portfolio. You've not had the insightful experience of having a currency devalued or hyper-inflated while it sits in your pockets. You probably didn't have trouble finding a job around 08-09. You've not felt the pain of helplessness and defeat when the government enforces austerity measures. The bank holds your money, and you can have it back whenever you want, and there's not much more to it.
Except when it doesn't, and you can't, and there's really no explanation that helps. If you've ever been robbed, or had your car stolen, you'll know what this feels like. Either way the Greek economic talks go, the Greek people are going to get fucked in the ass, for no fault of their own.
Bitcoin is a serious way to hedge that risk. Bitcoin and the Euro are currencies, and it would be smart (especially now for the Greeks) to not keep all your eggs in one basket.

It would be naive to look at the short-term graph of two things and say, "well this is going down, and at the same time, this is going up, so they must be inversely related, and therefore makes a good hedge."

It seems it's aimed at the uninitiated, as in it goes through mining, decentralization, satoshi, public/private keys, push vs pull payments, bailouts/bailins, the traditional financial industry and more. It might be very good for the audience that has only heard of bitcoin a handful of times through headlines, but never really looked into it.
If you have watched previous bitcoin documentaries, Magic Money is nice because it's a 2016 update on the bitcoin space. If you are a bitcoin veteran, you could easily pass on this video.

The authors of this book recently did a Talks at Google, and were unimpressive. They are journalists, and may do a decent job of reporting about bitcoin and its short history, but they do not understand the software or the community.

Fair enough, can't argue with the market. 
My post was an attempt restart the conversation about smaller denominations. If btc is now being considered digital gold, bits are the digital pennies.
If the community can begin speaking in terms of the pennies, then I believe it would reduce the reluctance of the non-initiated to try playing with btc. I think that would make all the difference.

Bitcoin allows for a new paradigm in monetary policy and social accords for compensation. It gives people choice, and allows for the natural order of markets to set prices. I'm of the opinion that in the near future, due to bitcoin and related innovations, we will shift away from regulations and policies dictated by a privileged oligarchy.
Yes, the video does not explicitly mention bitcoin, but I would hope that this sub is not so narrow-minded. Bitcoin is monetary sovereignty. The repercussions of that freedom will be felt globally.

Sorry, this is just my opinion. I have no research to offer other than my short time following the community, my experiments with other investments, and my inumberable conversations about Bitcoin with skeptics. 
The notion of smaller denominations has come about a few times. I'm looking forward to mass adoption. If 1 btc has an astronomical price, I liken it to Berkshire Hathaway, in that it is very exclusive, and many just throw up their hands and think that they cannot participate. 
Feel free to offer your opinion as well.

Is not the reputation of a torrent in related to the number of seeders? You could vouch for the content based on popularity, and send btc to whichever peer serves you each piece, as verified by the hashes contained in the torrent metadata.

From a user's perspective, I could imagine just purchasing content X for $1. As the download completes, I see 1% completed, and $0.01 of btc deducted from my wallet, and so on.
At the packet level, I'm not really concerned about 'what comes first'. I would be content with not losing my full $1, and with having each packet verified against the torrent's hashes.

Unfortunately, all you can do is bitch about what other people do with their own money.

Right! You're getting close! Don't quit just yet :)
You only have lost money if you sell your goat shit for $0. You then no longer have your money, or your goat shit.
If, on the other hand, you hold onto your goat shit, you can wait for someone to buy it for more than $0. You'd logically want to sell it to someone for more than you bought it for (see: [stocks](


This implies that the public perception of the value of goat shit has gone to $0, so it is worthless to everyone. Most likely, someone (I duno some farmers in India) are probably still willing to buy your goat shit. So your goat shit is actually worth something, even though you yourself may think it's worth $0.
Protip: BTC is not a stock, so don't think of it as one. You can exchange your goat shit it for goods and services. The current price just tells you how much you can get per gram of goat shit.

Supply and demand. Both currencies are seeing supply increase without an equal increase in demand, so the value goes down.
The thing is, there's no reasonable way to turn it around for Venezuela, and the value will keep dropping. On the other hand, bitcoin has a cap on supply, and if you don't think demand is going up, you're not paying attention.
So the story is posted here because it's interesting to hear of how other currencies are doing. These are two currencies, and there's a ton of interest in comparing them.

Not sarcastic. I'm all for promoting adoption, but nagging people into it won't work.
A simple question like this is perfect, because it's passive and just a part of regular business, but it does the name drop for someone who hasn't heard of it before.
If this were done, just as subtly, by each bitcoiner, we would likely have more people seeking out info about Bitcoin, rather than having it shoved down their throats.

Given the situation, if there is a massive collapse of the current financial system, along with a mass exodus from fiat into bitcoin, the unavoidable truth would be that bitcoiners would become responsible for taking the positions of the market-makers.
Maybe this isn't what the early adopters are hoping for, to start a business to fill a market gap, but I sure as hell am not looking to Goldman Sachs for a job at that point. I'll be looking to bitcoin-funded startups.
Whatever way it goes, and however fun it may be to play out the thought-experiment, there are far more variables at play than all of can consider together.

price of a bitcoin ~= value of a bitcoin ~= usefulness of a bitcoin ~= how much bitcoin is used ~= number of transactions

"I had done my research and knew how to safely and anonymously complete the order. Despite those preparations, I was still feeling a bit anxious so I took every precaution. I went through a site called LocalBitcoins to purchase Bitcoin face-to-face with cash from a surprisingly nice and normal guy. Using cash allowed me to avoid purchasing the Bitcoin online with a credit card and tying my identity to the transaction. He transferred the Bitcoin to a wallet that I had set up in advance, which had no connection to my real identity. In order to further protect my anonymity, I decided to use the Tails operating system because it is a privacy-focused OS that can fit on (and be booted from) a flash drive. Tails doesn’t access your computer’s hard drive or store any information from your session permanently. After booting up Tails on my laptop, I used a public Wi-Fi network and the Tor browser bundle to anonymously access the Bitcoin wallet and transfer the digital currency to the market. My anxiety had melted away by this point and was replaced by excitement about the process I was going through."

You can't reasonably expect any such measures to last long (ie. Silk Road, Pirate Bay, Popcorn Time). Blocking services would immediately create an underground market, which would most likely drive the price up. A dozen services would pop up the next day using whatever means necessary to exchange USD/BTC.
Because it is decentralized, it's pretty much a hydra/honey badger/pandora's box, and can't be stopped. You can't shut down bitcoin.

That's a good question. From what I know, it seems that it is procedural, made to scale with total hash power available, recalculated every 2 weeks.
He makes the very good point that if this was not built in, as miners joined and the total hash power increased, blocks would be found faster and faster, and each block would capture less and less transactions, making the process significantly inefficient.

So you're focusing on the aspect of bitcoin becoming a real currency, and the risk of states stepping in to either not give it their blessing, or go 1984 on us.
My argument is that bitcoin is already a 'real' currency. People get paid in it, and people spend it. It never needed a regulatory body's stamp of approval. Bitcoin don't care. The risk exists, but not really bothering me.
If things went south for bitcoin, it would be very exciting times to say the least.

Fair enough. I would go with the first option as well.
I square that circle because I don't think that the state promotes income equality. It does quite the opposite IMHO. I think the state takes from the middle class and gives to the 'lazy' lower and the 'greedy' upper. I don't think it should do this.
I do think everyone is equal, and should have a *fair* chance (not equal income). If you do hard things and provide value, you should get a proportional share of the pie. I believe everyone is unique, and that some will work harder than others and earn more.
So my original point was that the playing field today is unfair. The inequality of wealth, as described in the video, has developed over generations and seems to have accelerated during my own lifetime (bailouts and QE). I posted in r/bitcoin because I think that bitcoin (if all goes well) can level the playing field within a generation.

Best answer.
I'd like to add, if you can avoid it, don't sell now. I'm assuming that you bought at a price higher than what it is now, you will lock in that loss if you sell.
If you can liquidate something else for cash, it might save you a lot of value.

This isn't fractional reserve banking. FRB is where a bank loans out $1000, and is only legally obligated to have $100 of deposits on the books.
You've just described a person depositing $100, and the bank loaning out $50.
With bitcoin, you cannot make new money. You cannot do fractional reserve with bitcoin, unless you're handing out monopoly money for loans.

If that's what they decide, how would that work out? Put regular, honest, productive people in jail en mass? It would be just about as effective as the DEA is at stopping drug use, along with a perpetual "War on Bitcoin".

The people of this planet may be like a flock of birds. They split and form with a sort of fuzzy order. Sometime there are waves, sometime there are drops. To get a sense of where they are going, you have to step back and look at the whole flock, which is several orders of magnitude larger than any one bird.
The longer you've been on bitcoin, the longer you've been looking at things from a global scale. Bitcoin is international. And so the value of bitcoin grows as the global perception of bitcoin grows and fluctuates.

The miners will simply act in their own best interest. Check out [this chart]( (miners on the left). They want bitcoin to succeed because they hold bitcoin. Okay so that's the backdrop.
If there's a huge influx of transactions, it'll buffer in the mempool until enough blocks eat them up. Miners are incentivized to include transactions. The higher the fee, the higher the priority. The dust (no fee transactions) will sit at the bottom until someone's nice enough to pick up the trash. During this time, if you want your transaction to go through pronto, tip the damn miners.
So, they can only confirm 1mb at a time, so what. The mempool grows. If the mempool gets too big, its the miners problem. Either they pick up the dust, or they upgrade their software to one of the BIPs that take more transactions per block. They'll do it when it is needed, and there is nothing non-miners can do about it lol
Fun fact, the 1mb limit is arbitrary. Satoshi and company put it on in the early days to reduce spam or a ddos or something.
As for forks, the last big one, which had maybe ~~6~~ 31 blocks found on two separate chains, it was eventually merged by consensus (miners talking to other miners and figuring shit out / not asking reddit's opinion on the matter). It was a scare, but the point of it all is, everyone involved wants Bitcoin to succeed (maintain its viability and value).
As Andreas would say, Bitcoin is anti-fragile. All you have to do is hodl.

Hi Roger. I understand what you're doing with bitcoin.com and the forum. You are clearly one of the greater proponents for bitcoin, and IMO you are doing what needs to be done to ensure the long-term success of the blockchain.

There isn't a doubt of this. It's a non-issue. So what if he is? With regards to ownership, he can do with it what he likes. With regards to tin-foil-hats, yes, he's promoting bitcoin.
IMO he's in the bitcoin game for the long-run. He's been in the space longer than most, and is likely more invested than most. I really doubt he's trying to bank on traffic for ad revenue.


wtf? Seriously, I do not see what you think he's trying to dupe you into doing. Are you actually implying some wrongdoing? or are you a shill trying to develop some gossip and slander? Also, don't insert adjectives with "read:" attached to them as a cheap and convenient way to insert your opinion. It make it seem like you're the one trying to sell some idea...  (O.O)

They did not specify in [the video]( It was said fairly quickly and casually.
Given the relative costs of the vehicle leases and insurance products they are hoping to sell, my guess is that they'll write it to whichever blockchain the consumer wants.
Writing it to the bitcoin blockchain would involve a massive inconvenience of about $0.10.

Interesting perspective. 
I guess this image does give a negative vibe with the imagery of the roots being colorless and underground. I can definitely see the use case of religious extremism. 
You might consider the plant representing a somewhat libertarian movement in response to the big banks, such as the Liberty Dollar, or other efforts towards decentralization. The Liberty Dollar was crushed, but the movement remains and Bitcoin evolved as a result. 
Another example would be music sharing. The plant might represent Napster, the thumb the music industry. The resulting spread of the roots, and effectively the foundation for a worldwide network of peer to peer data movement, grew as a result of the music industry trying to stomp out one small plant.
