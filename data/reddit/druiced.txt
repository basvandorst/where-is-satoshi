I don’t use Coinbase often but there is no way I would close my account and lose an extra channel to sell crypto for fiat. When the time comes I want multiple options. I want to be fully verified on multiple exchanges and if you’re not, you may be the one caught with your pants down.

Interesting - all my transfers are free at Bofa. 
Edit: the writer said profit margin which is incorrect. Revenue - Expenses = Net Income. 
I am 100% for Bitcoin but these horrible inaccurate articles hurt Bitcoin more than help it.

Source? There are individual companies that do greater than billion dollar transfers on a daily basis (I know from professional experience at a smaller bank). Add the combination of all wire transfers for HSBC (the big dog), they can easily run in to 100s of billions in wire transfers in a day (maybe not every day). Even if it took a week to hit 700 billion in transfers, it still helps put this in to perspective and how the media and politicians will deceive their audience to perpetuate their own motives. 
The more oversight any regulatory body has, the more they are able to pump out fines and publish biased agendas. In the end, it doesn't cost a bank more (and they don't charge more) to perform a $100,000 versus a $1,000,000,000 transfer.

This is the exact event or 'headline' I was referring to. HSBC is likely participating in more than 670 Billion in wire transfers in a single day (so we have a better idea of volume). The specific transfers which were counted to reach this sum were part of transfers where the  names contained database flaws, which if created intentionally, were added be individual agents and not as a corporate policy. The sum does not mean that amount of money was actually delivered to restricted accounts but the number of transactions which may have bypassed the established policy's/systems designed to catch restricted transfers from completing. I can elaborate more on the challenges of large corporate operations and I am not arguing in HSBCs defense. It is just important this community understands how any business with deep pockets will be exploited for money if the opportunity presents itself to the politicians or regulating body's.

(Large) Banks don't intentionally violate KYC/AML regulations. There just isn't enough money/profit in the money transfer business to break the rules. Scrutinizing hundreds of millions of transactions every day and documenting that work is a massive operational challenge, but that reason doesn't make a good headlines.

This is the only solution. Any country where their population is fleeing, their leadership should be held accountable by the rest of the world.

Everyone I know tips when they Uber. They usually tip CASH, why is this any different?

They should deregulate the banks. The government just wants their hand in the Bank’s pocket so they can extract money for themselves. The government is the real too big to fail. 
Sounds like you want them to regulate Crypto also. Hopefully not like some countries requiring crypto to have some kind of central control to them. Blah!

Anyone that is paying the Visa/MC transaction fees that exchanges are charging to load up the dollars has questionable judgement.

I didn’t realize people still use twitter. I thought it was only bots on there.

Looks like a sweet project. 
The media is only available as long as the related torrents are still being hosted? (Is this just indexing magnets)?

The ETF rejection and what is coming up in August seem like completely different things. The ETF situation was external of bitcoin itself.

Why wouldn't you take your profits off the table and wait until the future of bitcoin is settled in August?
