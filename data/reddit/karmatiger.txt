Remember, just last month they were predicting 10K by the end of *next year*. After this "crash" it's still above 16K.
Yeah it's creepy that Bitcoin Cash listed at $9,000 on Coinbase while it was $3,200 on all the other exchanges, which smacks of collusion... and such an artificial pump on any regulated market would send the instigators to jail... but as far as Bitcoin prices go, we're still okay.

In the case of Silk Road, he was logged in when they caught him.

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:37:41
fair point. I don't know what all the pearl clutching is about... it's well north of $16k when it just reached 10k for the first time three weeks ago.

Perhaps the coders are from ivy league colleges. Or one has a crush on a girl called Ivy.

I don't think you do. Else there'd be little advantage to LN.

No worries - we all have those days :)

QuadrigaCX. Instant cash deposit for 1.5%, no fees for sending BTC to another wallet, coin prices slightly lower than other exchanges in my experience.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:01:49
Many thanks!

Google orders searches based on your internet activity, so the order is different for everyone. For me the first link was to a slack tipbot ;) But I did find it, thanks

It's odd that Bekerman thinks that a letter with lines is unique to "US dollar symbology" (I guess he's not heard of  €, £, ¥, etc.) and that fiat is an acronym.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:34:30
Gemini, GDAX (yes it's coinbase owned, but a separate server), bithumb, quadriga, etc. etc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:09

what are the fees like compared to centralised exchanges?

It didn't say Jordan b Spencer DBA DJ Jordan though, did it?
Sod it. If it's important enough to you to go creeping through people's Facebook accounts just to feel like you're right about something, we'll leave it there.

that's the spirit :)

In the academic space there is lots of research going unfunded because the computational power required is deemed too expensive. I would argue that using an existing network that's already crunching numbers, but doing so to crunch these numbers instead, could drastically reduce that pricetag and make such research far cheaper, which would wrest the funding decisions away from the parties you mention and into the hands of those more concerned about research outcomes than profitability - ergo making it more about righteous inquiry, as you put it.

Gen X goes to the mid 70s. 
There are plenty of Gen Xers in the Bitcoin space, (as you said, you're among them ;) ). See Andreas and Chameth as examples.
There are plenty of Gen Xers and Boomers trying to affect social change, whether marching in the streets, running foundations, or organising voter drives. All of which has strong online presence.
Bitcoin, let's not forget, is going up in part because Cypriots, Grecians, Argentinians, Indians, et al, finding their currency in rapid inflation or devalued, are pouring money into Bitcoin. This is in no way a majority millennial move.
The world is global. Because what is happening in one person's backyard may show signs of age segregation, that doesn't make it a common experience.
I hope you're right about the next generation. I really, really do.

I prefer a mobile wallet over a desktop one... your desktop could get malware that lets someone rifle through all your files.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:22:14
I'm sorry certain people are using this as a platform to attack you without knowing you or the full details, or to exploit your naivité for their own gain.
I sincerely hope you find someone who is willing to walk you through methods of tracking down the wallet(s) information without asking you specifics or requesting a fee.
The advice offered by and are excellent places to start. Best of luck, and best wishes.

Bitcoin is seized all the time. The guy that set up Silk Road? His bitcoin were auctioned off by the federal government after they were seized. Some lesser known narco had his bitcoin seized last year, and now the state government (I wanna say Kansas, but I could be wrong) is salivating at the prospect of what they'll get when they auction it in the very near future.

Bank of Canada governor isn't a lawmaker, really. Just the guy who sets Canada's interest rates. He's like the head of the Federal Reserve in the US.

Have you got a friend overseas who can buy for you and send it to you? I buy on a few exchanges for friends frequently.

Fair point... but there aren't a lot of regular unmanned launches that land on the moon. Nor manned either, but with manned ones you'd worry about one of the astronauts/cosmonauts/tychonauts pocketing the key

maybe you should look into how Coinbase cocked up the launch, then had to freeze trading.

The bounty would have to be huge to pay for the launch to put it there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:06:24
eh - some people think it'll always go up, and a dip scares them. But yeah, I'm with you on the other coins. I prefer bitcoin, but "The brand I bought is better than the brand you bought" tribalism is pretty bloody stupid, no matter the item in question.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:31:16
apparently you didn't notice s/he was mentioning three separate things.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:15:31
Pyramid schemes don't have people worldwide pouring cash into it as a value holder because their own currencies are being devalued.
But yeah, if someone is buying to speculate they shouldn't invest more than they can afford to lose.

If he was using a business account, they would have addressed it to the business name on the account not his personal name.

It was already in the market. It just entered the noob exchange, and happened to do so on the day of a co-ordinated dump.

Newsflash: It's not a generational thing, it's an entitled vs. not entitled thing.
* That 67 year old marching for women's birth control rights? She's a boomer, but she's on your side. 
* Martin Shkreli? Millenial. Not on your side.
* Bernie Sanders? Boomer. Like or hate his politics, he's trying to be on your side.
* Mark Karpelès? Millenial. Not on your side.
The system is tuned for those who have cash and use it for their own benefit, not tuned by generation. Plenty of boomers (and the oft-forgotten thick layer of Generation X in between boomers and millenials) get fucked by the establishment too. Don't buy into the generational warfare BS. It's no more real than blaming a race or gender for your ills.

It only gives "webcam" or "mobile phone" options. There's no "upload a photo" option. You either hold up your ID to your webcam or your phone cam when prompted by their built-in reader.

Consider the "gold standard" that fiat currency used to be backed by- it relied on people agreeing that gold is valuable. Lately it has applications in industry, but for thousands of years it was valuable just for being neat to look at and everyone agreeing it had value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:58:47
You negotiate the price with them, it goes from their wallet to yours without going onto an exchange so it bypasses all the potential for someone else to walk off with your bitcoin that an exchange potentially has, it can go from one paper wallet to another, and so on.

"You have exceeded the maximum number of attempts for today. Please try again in 24 hours"
4 times is maximum? And triggers a 24 hour lockout?  Bit of a shit system for verifying a highly time sensitive exchange account.
