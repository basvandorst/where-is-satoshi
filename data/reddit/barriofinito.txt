The whole bitcoin took a massive hit with this "hack"...hack or no, the damage done to reputation of btc is yet to be seen, sadly.
And yes, there should be criminal charges brought up....But if this was some sort of a "false flag" .... problem is here, reaction in ongoing, what will be the solution i wonder...

Or you could return just 25 of mine that you stole :D...that be nice....:D
Oh, the hack....well done, took some brains to do it :D not that I endorse it ...

Ive tried that one before...Didnt get no info tho....If im not mistaken, Bitstamp and Kraken (i think) are the only markets that clearly states who is CEO and who is on board of directors...

I think in most of countries you will need some kind of licence,but obtaining it is another thing. In some countries it takes like no time, then in others, like you said, it takes ages. Business idea?Looking for one too :)

good question...and DAMNNN!!!!!!! 
If so, what can one do? couse this could be a big issue for everybody that had an account with em...
@_date: 2016-04-18 07:14:58
try ASIC miners, GPU just wont do. and with only 1 GPU even if you mine altcoins you wont get much due to N factor and all

Bistamp, Kraken, or any other big exchage...make sure you use 2FA security....you dont want your account hacked now ;) If you need some more help, feel free to contact me via pm

Since you are a  US soldier, i think you could / should contact Kraken exchange, since they are from San Francisco, maybe they can help you out or point you in the right way...Worth a try...

Bitstamp and Kraken ....

if you got a laptop, download a wallet, jump on localbitcoins and find a local seller, get a cup of coffee with him and make the deal, secret is yours to keep ;) and when you get a chance, open an account on Bitstamp, Kraken or any big market. Hope everything works out for you :)

you can buy em "face 2 face" using localbitcoins.com , but then you would need a wallet of your own witch would solve your problem. Or you could ask a friend of yours that would buy em for you and keep em until you get home

static password for the login 2fa....not a smart idea...
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:11:53

1st off, please read, i wrote "i would give you half , and thats on MY kids"...meaning i swear on my kids....maybe you havent heard the expression before. And yes, if i made a mistake like that and someone would return my money, i would repay / reward him, couse he didnt have to return the money...But to each its own right? :)
Have fun and tnx for reachin out :)
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:19:12
WoW your the man! If i made a mistake like that and you solved it, like you did, id give you half...and that on my kids!
