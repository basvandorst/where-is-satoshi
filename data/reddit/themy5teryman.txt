And this right here is living proof that 90% of people trading bitcoin have no clue what they are doing.

How the fuck is bitcoin not a fiat? The only reason it has value is because people know they can trade it for their own fiat currency.

That is true.
But the value of money will go down over time, and bitcoin will not - there are a limited amount, so it is naturally deflationary. So then why would anybody buy bitcoin for anything other than speculation? Why would you spend bitcoin you have if it will always be worth more tomorrow?

I never said that. But you can't assume that because it went up in the past it will in the future.

Here's a question: There are a limited amount of bitcoin that can be made. This makes it highly deflationary. Why should someone ever buy anything with bitcoin if it is so deflationary?

But why would someone use bitcoin over money? If the amount of people who want to go into bitcoin increase, but the cap has been reached, the price will go up. Why would any bitcoin holders want to use bitcoin then? Also, it doesn't have to be 1 person inbesting 10%. It can be lots of people.

How would it become slower? Either Bitcoin doesn't become a thing or it does but the price continues to rise due to new people coming into it. It IS a fiat currency because whether or not something is a fiat currency is not dependent on if it is backed by a government or continually printed, but rather whether the thing itself holds any actual value. For example, salt is not a fiat currency because it has actual value. Cash is because it only has value because everyone says it has value. Bitcoin is just electronic cash, except it is incredibly deflationary.

Past =/= Future

Both of your examples are products or services that made life easier. How does Bitcoin make anything easier or better?
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:24:10
But PayPal exists. You don't need a special currency to give people on the internet money.

EXACTLY! Everyone think's their a financial genius because they guessed correctly on which crypto is the mainline one. It's easy to call yourself a genius when the price has been going up for years.

How is bitcoin not a fiat currency? And why would the value of Bitcoin go down? Wouldn't it continue to go up because of how deflationary it is?
