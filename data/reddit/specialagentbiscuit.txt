But you don't do it all together collectively exactly one month before, either. That sounds unlikely to me. Unless they're all programmed to do precisely that, each year again like clockwork, in which case I should probably sell next year at the start of Jan and buy again during the Lunar dip.

"1 USDT is still worth 1 usd"
As is 1 usd. So why not just find safety in real dollars, instead of tethers? I still don't get it.

Thanks for your elaborate answer, appreciated.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:20:08
No man, that's Feb 16th. Which possibly means another dip.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:44:54
Sooo according to your analysis, are we in the clear yet?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:52:14
Man, I just hope you're right.

Hmmm yeah, that could be true.
But where I live, we have to pay property tax on hodlings, so it's taxable regardless.

The only good news from all of this :)

Not sure, lunar new year falls on different dates every year. Last year it was more than 2 weeks earlier than this year.
In any case, I hope you guys are right, and I look forward to the recovery.
By the way, I'm curious: did you sell your crypto prior to this crash?
Maybe I'll try to exploit this lunar new years thing next year.

Probably posted already, but heck:
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:29:26
Yeah, that's probably it. Although I never understood why people would want to trade on a platform that doesn't accept FIAT and has no FIAT trading pairs. That already seems shady to me.

Maybe. In any case, I just hope Azothar is right and that we will recover shortly afterwards.

To buy off stress.
I can finally start enjoying my life and do the things I want to do, design and build houses, solve problems, support progressive projects, make art and music, without the stress of having to earn money.
I don't want expensive things.
Currently my life revolves around office work and survival :( It drains my creativity, inspiration and happiness, but I need the money. Haven't been on a vacation for over three years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:25:44
Yeah, seems like there are trades taking place.
No crash yet, looks stable at ~$4,300 so far.

You do realize John is a staunch supporter of Bitcoin Cash, Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, right?
He told on numerous occasions that he considers Jihan Wu's Bitcoin THE Bitcoin. Even if that means Bitcoin Cash.

Are you sure? It seems to me that things are progressing slower than we want. Implementing LN is going to be rather difficult. It's complex. Maybe early 2019.

Should HAVE. I expected better from Canadian education.

I hope Gemini replaces coinbase/GDAX and conquers at least a sixth place on the most popular exchange list (trading volume):
I like the sound of it as well. 'Gemini'. Sounds cool.
Me and my bro are twins as well, basically inseparable, so I might be a bit biased :)
Go team Winklevoss!
