To be fair, they already took your money when you bought. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:25
Yeah this “free money” looks sweet it will probably be worth 10% of what it says when we can sell
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:35
Wish I could sell it
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:54:05
Eh, I used Gemini to trade, MUCH lower fees

And now all the other coins are crashing
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:57
Yeah I can’t move it in the app yet though.

If there are less, the value of what is left increases. 0.000001 bitcoin may be worth less than 0 cents now, that may not always be the case. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:28:55
Wouldn't the value of Bitcoin just adjust to the loss over time? I would speculate that the value would just continue to increase and the loss would be counteracted over such a long timeframe

Can't governments control the means by which we access the chain? Regulate Apps, websites, etc? How do we access if it becomes regulated, which inevitability it will be.

I hope it corrects, so I can buy more...
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:00:27
So if I transferred my coins from coinbase to a paper wallet after 1 Aug does that mean I don't know which chain my coins are on?
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:01:13
How does that work with claiming it as an income on taxes? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:48:56
Thanks for taking the time to respond 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:28:58
I get downvotes, but explain why you think what I said should be downvoted...

I get the capital gains with respect to fiat, but how do claim a capital gain against a service? Who determines the value? Bitcoin isn't really a recognize currency am I correct? Likewise, if I were to say, invest $10,000 in BTC, hold it for 20 years, it becomes a form of payment (worldwide) now worth $500,000, and I use BTC to pay for goods, do I then never have to pay taxes on it?

Impossible to measure, if it were measured then the answer would be everyone... what happens when you ask the question “have you thought about purchasing bitcoin?”... boom, they just thought about it. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:18:32
Bad trade
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:07:40
Update your coinbase app!

No, the issue is that we don’t know what the actual survey question was. Based on the results and the way it is reported, it looks as though the question was just a preference between “Bitcoin” OR “Stocks or bonds”. Because stocks/ bonds a such a different asset class, it isn’t a fair comparison. 
That said, If the survey question did indeed break down stocks and bonds into separate choices then the conclusion may have a just little more impact. Still, comparing those 3 independently isn’t really useful imo.
A better survey would have been just to eliminate bonds (or stocks) as an option altogether. Stocks/bitcoin comparison would be more relevant for that age group.

Coinbase I think is pretty darn simple. Transferred to paper wallet after purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:03:57
Investments should be made based on what you think the % return will be, not how much each “unit” costs. It doesn’t matter if you can buy a whole one or not
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:56:23
These people are idiots
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:24:47
It’s interesting to me to see these governments attempt to control something they have no control over. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:50:29
And the Dollar is backed by the government. Hahahaha
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:52:19
It has value! Why? Because we say so
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:10:31
“Bonds or stocks”... loaded question, they are two completely different things to invest in. 
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:34:05
You’ll own both Bitcoin and whatever the other Blockchain is. You’re transaction exists on both.

Seem to be a lot of buyers at $3k then...
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:09:06
Have you seen House Hunters International? No way $300k will get you what you want
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:07:47
Considering most of the world still doesn't know what Bitcoin is, the ceiling is high 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:05:59
Not regulated. Yes, the answer is government!
