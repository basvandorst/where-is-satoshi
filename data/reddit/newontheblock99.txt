I shouldn’t?

Still gotta pay some fees, nowhere near as high as straight coinbase-&gt;quad but try  coinbase-&gt;GDAX-&gt;quad. GDAX doesn’t charge you an arm and a leg to transfer out and coinbase to GDAX is free

Every morning when I see it’s dipping, “yes bitcoin is going down!” And then my girlfriend “doesn’t that mean you’re losing money???”, “No, it just means I can buy more coins for cheaper!”
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:09:33
No no no you’ve got it backwards, buy memes first, orders later
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:32:53
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:11:46
So what you’re telling me is there’s an amazing chance to buy coming up?
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:00:36
Would you....you know....eat something of great importance to you????
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:30:30
I’ll invest in bananachain. Sign me up
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:07:16
Yeah, I feel better doing it that way than when FOMO hits during the upswings and you just wanna buy like crazy

@_date: 2018-05-29 01:48:13
Use path integrals, you’ll find the most probable one ;)
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:54:32
If it’s not too late move your coins from CB-&gt;GDAX-&gt;Quadriga to avoid paying transfer fees
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:07:02
Edit: so by running a node, can you confirm transactions and be awarded the fee or can this only be done with a mining setup?
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:43:31
Billy will pick the moon coin
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:11:12
I have the same question
@_date: 2019-03-08 19:40:28
Ah ok thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:47:15
Are you the Architect of the Matrix?
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:34:46
Well he is a dog, so I’m sure he does cool shit on the daily
@_date: 2019-02-23 03:22:55
Doge is the the only constant in this universe and never disappoints
1 doge = 1 doge
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:07:04
Sounds like the most expensive game you'll ever buy...
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:49:58
0.01BTC, this guys clearly from the future so he knows that's a steal
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:58:24
I think some of the best advice I've seen on r/bitcoin to any new investor has been to make sure you've cleared any and all high interest debts before allocating money to investing. Taking out large sums of money for a bet, cause that's essentially what you're doing, is a terrible idea, yea sometimes you win big, but more often than not you lose big
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:34
Bought some more this morning, and then transferred it to my wallet
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:38
Got some btc out just in time....
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:08:28
Get ready to buy the dip!!!!
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:21:34
Buying after a spike because you think it’s gonna start climbing is the worst thing you could do
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:45:25
I count 17
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:32:12
Yeah this user messaged me twice in two days....
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:58:58
Why does have beard?
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:51:44
Exactly, but you can’t have that mindset that this is indeed the start of a bull run. Buy when you are comfortable buying and only an amount that if it was gone tomorrow you wouldn’t bat an eye
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:54:09
That’s one thing we can agree on
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:58:27
Sorry /s
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:24:45
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:56:29
For the laugh, I thank you
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:11:20
I was laughing at “the morons trading 10 bucks of bitcoin and complained they were going to get visited by the IRS”
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:28:33
New ICO? Bitcoin Thread?
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:39:40
Am I the only one bothered by the improper use of decimal points instead of commas.......
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:20:32
Nothing can ever be as bad as the imperial system....
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:20:28
You misspelt hodling 
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:54:39
But, bitcoinless, he did not
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:42:41
Wow I guess you learn something new every day, my apologies
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:03:34
All this tells me is I need to start hodling more memes, can someone point me to an exchange where I can acquire some
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:49:29
Well why is 4 million plural, how many 4 millions are there to go?
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:59:01
Let me clarify. With the August 1st deadline coming up everyone was saying to pull coins of the market until At least the second. Now with it looking like Segwit is happening with out a split, what's everyone's opinion now?
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:19:02
But he said i he bought (x)GBP of bitcoin.....
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:03:37
I just opened a Coinbase account today, can I move any purchases from coinbase to gdax?
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:54:44
Where do I buy my party hat?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:41:15
