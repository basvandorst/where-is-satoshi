Thank you! I couldn't remember the exact standard, but that's what I was referring to with the "nothing up my sleeve " numbers.
I guess I didn't get to my point in my original post, which is: just because a good product comes from bad people doesn't mean it shouldn't be used, it simply means it should be independently investigated for flaws or weaknesses, and SHA256 has passed independent review so far.


I'm not going to say that you're wrong, but I don't think we have any evidence that they are shifting towards exploits *instead of* subtly weak proposals. The NSA has a huge budget that has only grown in the past few years, so they could very well be ramping up their exploit development while continuing their push for standards with weaknesses known only to them. All I'm saying is that I think assuming that they are backing off of weak proposals is a potentially dangerous assumption that isn't backed by evidence.

You have to tell the whole truth here.
Bitcoin uses SHA256, which is a NIST standard that has been vetted thoroughly by cryptographers from all around the world, including some at the NSA, from which is was proposed.
The NSA has been caught proposing standards with suspected "nothing up my sleeve numbers" before. But in the ancient computing past they were rather helpful in securing computer communications against attacks that were not publicly known at the time (eg: DES S-boxes).
