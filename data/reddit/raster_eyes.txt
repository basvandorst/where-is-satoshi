Wish it told me the correct answers at the end.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:43
I agree for the most part. But it still has been around for much longer than most other alt coins giving it a bit more integrity and seems to follow BTCs peaks and valleys, so if BTC goes up in the future, LTC will likely follow to some degree. Ultimately I agree with you, although I don't think a miracle is required for it to gain some value, just would require another wave of crypto hype.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:17:27
Same here. I agree

Maybe they are just hoping for a secure store of value for a small portion of their holdings. Or maybe they are looking for a hedge in their portfolio against the global financial system. Or maybe they are using it as an easier, more efficient, and more secure form of gold.

Nice! So I'm assuming the ATM had a payment channel or was a node on the LN?

Keep holding the LTC for a bit, it will probably regain most of its value in the next few months. Obviously I can't say this with absolute certainty, but I have faith.

Pausing by releasing the down key? More like playing is activated by scrolling, but it actually feels more like scrubbing. And it is a benefit because it allows for the "video" to play at whatever pace you want giving you time to read and absorb all the information at your own speed.

No fees if you do everything in gdax (with limit orders), which is basically the same thing as coinbase since you can move funds to and from them instantly with no cost.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:14:54
Bitcoin functioned well as a currency for many years. It wasn’t until the last year or two that transaction fees have been over 1-10 cents. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:26:32
When transferring from coinbase/gdax the fee is 0 but for some reason they're the ones getting the bad reviews. And you can even purchase/trade without any fees either (when using limit orders).
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:08:14
You realize the issue of fees and transfer times is a new problem right? even just a year ago Bitcoin was basically free and instant.

Bitcoins are represented by electrons and transistors in silicon chips. Atoms are made up of electrons. So Bitcoins are made of the stuff that makes up atoms. Not that being made up of atoms has any relevance to value anyways. Thoughts and ideas can be very valuable but aren’t made of atoms either.

Yes, if your analysis tells you that passing a certain price point signals a bullish trend you may want to set a stop at that price so that your starting position is at the beginning of the bull trend. This is something used by day traders who sit around looking at charts doing technical analysis.

Yea, I dunno. If there is a way to sell 2x coins safely I'd sure as hell love to know it though, lol. I don't think it ever really happened tho. Or if it did its not being used or exchanged anywhere that I know of.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:39:37
The network itself. this article gives the most detailed explanation:
TLDR: We are used to currencies as being separate from their means of exchange. You have a dollar bill that is a stand-alone object, and its means of exchange which can either be a system like paypal or a banking network. Bitcoin is different than any other currency in that it is inseparable from its means of exchange or network. So Bitcoin's intrinsic value is its payment system and its network size. There are other systems like it that are less valuable because their network is much smaller (ie alt coins). There are other payment systems out there with much larger networks, but their system is much less elegant, more centrally controlled, and less secure (ie banks, Paypal, etc...) The combination of these two qualities is what creates Bitcoin's "instrinsic value"
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:27:21
To be fair BTC didn't really perform that great in the following weeks either. Actually ETH has performed far better than BTC in the weeks following Coinbase's BCH dump iirc.

I was going to say the same thing. Bitcoin banking the unbanked works in developing nations, but in 1st world nations not as much. If bitcoin becomes more widely accepted in everyday commerce and businesses have options for paying employees with it then that may change though.

Well, first we have to figure out how to get to the nearest star before it could technically be "interstellar"
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:10:12
Already possible with lightning
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:29:38
Yes, there is a counter argument that Strix Leviathan dropped just a few days ago, actually. But their analysis was based on data collected on mostly altcoins with halving cycles like bitcoin. Since miners mine altcoins based on profitability algorithms (looking at difficulty vs mining reward vs exchange rate vs etc...), and altcoins don’t have the same trade volume or liquidity, that to me kind of invalidates it as insight into bitcoin’s halvings, since it skews the dynamic in my opinion.  But I’d like to hear someone convince me otherwise.
Anyways, here’s the article: 
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:03:10
My guess is cause on most levels it’s just as good as the newer one but a lot cheaper. But also, why just Trezor? Ledger is equally good in my opinion, just in different ways.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:18:20
But, if lightning network succeeds fully, couldn't a lot of people just onboard directly onto LN, illuminating the need for a base layer block size increase?

Lol, you're really stretching the argument quite a bit just to suit your position at this point. We're talking about money as a REWARD for work. Once you have the money, keeping it isn't a reward, that's just maintaining an already settled status quo. U da daft 1 m8.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:22:26
Bitcoin did just fine after the other 3 or 4 hype cycles  that peaked and crashed.

This is a cool piece, both conceptually and aesthetically.
One thing I’m confused about. You said the chain is carved out of a single cube of steel/granite so that the chains are always interlocked, but in the photo of you polishing the one link you can clearly see it not interlocked with any other link.

Uses same name
Uses same logo
So, no, not like bitcoin cash
@_date: 2019-07-22 02:59:45
No. If I made a soda that was called “Pepsi Soda” and then used the Pepsi logo but in green instead of blue, that doesn’t make it a different name and logo than the actual Pepsi Company’s. Nor would arguing that it was different have any chance of holding up in court. And no one would believe me if I tried to claim I wasn’t trying to fraudulently mislead people into thinking my soda was Pepsi.
Newcomers might not know the difference between BTC and BCH, or at least get confused when visiting bitcoin.com. And, like the twitter post specifically references, the r/bitcoin vs r/btc etc... stuff can definitely be confusing and misleading to newcomers, also.
There’s really no defending it. On a technical level what bitcoin cash did is fine (ie. Forking the code and starting a new currency with some minor tweaks to the original), but stealing Bitcoin’s name and branding is where it just become straight up fraudulent.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:50:49
I thought 2x never happened. Also, I thought there was no replay protection on it anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:56:40
With fancy routing and other yet to be implemented lightning features these may not necessarily be requirements in the future. There is still much to be discovered and experimented with in LN.
I mean yea, to create a lightning wallet an onchain transaction has to be made at least once to open a channel. But after that one onchain transaction a potential infinite amount of offchain transactions could take place afterwards.

@_date: 2019-07-09 07:26:33
What are you talking about? I mean, I guess it depends what you mean by “soon” but the trend looks exactly like every other cycle we’ve seen. And every other cycle has the price breaking new ath shortly after the halving, which is in one year. 
Not to mention, bitcoin fundamentals have only been improving.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:34:25
Can look at the BCH, bitcoin gold, bitcoin sv, etc... forks for insight in that regard. In every case the majority of people realized the forks were bs

@_date: 2019-07-08 23:51:49
Not describing lightning network at all. Lightning network doesn’t require trust. What the top post is describing is basically a custodial account (like a bank account) that users of the same “bank” can send micropayments to each other. I think this is more similar to what bakkt has been talking about wanting to do.

Looking at bitcoin’s price history (which, even though we all know past performance is no guarantee of future gains, is really the only data that can actually be used to make predictions) it’s unlikely it will go below 8k ever again.

I can definitely see how it can appear that way, but it’s really just my excitement for the technology showing. I haven’t seen as exciting a technology since the internet was first starting to become a household utility, or the smartphone. And a lot of people were just as skeptic about those two things. And it’s good to be skeptic, you should be. Everyone always starts as a skeptic, and then once they really do the deep dive and and try to understand the tech in and out, and start using the tech, almost everyone comes out realizing just how powerful and game changing it really is.


Exactly. I’m just curious. How much experience do you have actually using bitcoin?


By the time bitcoin would reach some kind of mass adoption as a global currency and everyone receives paychecks in bitcoin (which may never happen, and if it did we’re talking probably ~20-years in the future, but I’ve never really suggested such an outcome, I’ve only argued that it’s use as store-of-value, like gold, seems inevitable) it will have already reached such a large market cap years and years prior that its value would be insanely stable and maybe just rise like ~2% per year.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:28:26
Yea, me neither. Still says new registrations are closed.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:23:54
probably more like 1/100
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:45:47
Me neither!
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:05:28
Which is basically what happened with BCH. Just replace the halving example with block size increase.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:43:22
But the “inflation” is planned and limited by the protocol, and has an expiration date, so it’s not really inflation at all since everyone knows exactly how many coins there will ever be. The amount of coins that will ever be “minted” can already be used in bitcoins total valuation at any given point and that amount will never change.

Musk came from a very wealthy family. He never had to work for anything he didn't want to just to get by. UBI levels the playing field so everyone has this kind of opportunity, not just the lucky ones who were born into the right families.

Could be done in Illustrator very easily also. Maybe easier even if you started with a vector of the bitcoin logo downloaded from the web. Would take like less than 10mins for someone with experience. The concept is what is cool though, nice one! Would love to see a version with text in gold foil.

This guy stonks
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:33:49
We're way earlier in the cycle than that. In October 2017 bitcoin's price had already quadrupled the previous ATH, right now we're still trying to establish stability at half the previous ATH.
If looking to the price chart for guidance, we will see the price bounce around between 9k and 14k for the next year or so. Then, a few months after the halving, there will be a rally to break previous ATH. Once we break previous ATH we will see big market moves like what was happening in Oct 2017, probably landing us a new ATH of anywhere between 100k-500k. This is all based purely on what we've seen in previous market cycles, but really, anything could happen.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:17:02
FYI, a lot of people definitely care
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:42:56
Not necessarily. If I buy my bitcoin from an exchange that allows deposits/withdrawals directly on the LN, and they keep enough reserves on the LN to satisfy withdrawals at all times, then no onchain transactions need to occur.

I don’t see any analogy. If each of those paddy dollars had a unique immutable code on them verifiable by a blockchain, were distributed as a reward for securing their immutability, were transferable over the internet, and were used and accepted all over the world, then maybe I would see a bit of an analogy.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:58:29
Ultimately, like most things regarding public opinion, agreed upon truths, and most sciences, it comes down to majority consensus based on recorded observations. My opinion would be that once the public opinion is made, it is pretty immutable unless new evidence (foundationally significant enough) is revealed to show that one chain is more legitimate than another. But this is really unlikely at this point. It would be akin to trying to prove an alternate theory of gravity. Again, I’m not an expert, just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:49:54

Bitcoin will only rise so far. If it became a globally adopted currency its value would actually be insanely stable with a slight value growth every year. Once everyone who needs it has it and your near the end of the adoption curve the market becomes super stable. so you couldn't just sit and wait to become rich at that point.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:09:27

I was going to say the same thing. At least once a week or month I encounter some kind of banking inefficiency that would be solved by bitcoin. I would love for bitcoin mass adoption, it would simplify so many frustrating complexities of banking instantaneously, but I also know that bitcoin isn’t ready yet. We need at least a few more years developing layer 2 protocols, but I think we can now at least see the light(ning) at the end of the tunnel.

With Ledger you can choose a low, medium, or high fee. I'm not sure if you can set a set a custom fee, though. But the "low" and "medium" fees are definitely lower than most exchanges or wallets with fixed amount fees. Don't know about Trezor, never used one.

If you’re new to bitcoin cash app or Coinbase app are the easiest and most foolproof way to buy btc, but they also have some of the highest fees (or margin, in the case of cash app).

When it comes to deriving bitcoin’s inherent value this article explains it best: 
The tldr for the article:
We are used to currencies as being separate from their means of exchange. You have a dollar bill that is a stand-alone object, and its means of exchange which can either be a system like PayPal or a banking network, or physically handing a bill to someone. Bitcoin is different than any other currency in that it is inseparable from its means of exchange or network. So bitcoin’s intrinsic value is its payment system and its network size. There are other systems like it that are less valuable because their network is much smaller (ie. alt coins). There are other payment systems out there with much larger networks, but their system is much less elegant and more centrally controlled (ie. banks and PayPal). The combination of these two qualities is what creates bitcoin’s “intrinsic value”
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:58:09
A UBI is only meant to cover the necessities in life like food, shelter, utilities, etc... There is still incentive to make more money so you can increase the quality of your life. People will always want to innovate for reasons beyond wealth anyways. Look at people like Elon Musk, he already made so much money with PayPal he would never have to work another day in his life and live lavishly at that. But then he went on to create a super innovative car company that creates all electric vehicles that perform better than any others in their class, and an incredibly innovative aerospace company that is completely changing the way we use rockets. Steve Jobs didn't need to create the iPhone to get rich, he was already extremely wealthy. A lot of the most innovative people in history came from families that had such deep pockets they had little to no economic incentive to innovate in the first place. In fact, innovation is inherently risky, so I would argue that NOT being wealthy stifles innovation because you are more likely to make safe bets your whole life since you don't have the kind of resources to allow you to invest in the kind of risky ventures that innovation requires. Plus there are countless studies that show that money isn't much of a motivator, just do a quick google search of "money incentive" and you will find that science says the exact opposite of what you've proposed. And money is freedom, making huge swathes of the population wage slaves is actually fundamentally anti-freedom.

They all came from wealthy families. People don't innovate without a comfortable amount of capital to be willing to risk the kind of money it takes to innovate. Having a financially comfortable life allows them to earn wealth much easier than most. And I know this first hand because I was left a fairly comfortable inheritance by my grandmother that allowed me to purchase a home cash, and I was given free education by the university my mother teaches at, I can see how much easier it is for me to accumulate wealth versus my friends who are all struggling just to pay their student debt and rent every month.

Yes, and therefore consensus. But if Bitcoin's value gets to a point where this is functionally necessary in order to make smaller transactions it would be a very low risk protocol change and would likely garner consensus without much resistance if any at all.

You missed the point. This has nothing to do with loss aversion. People are more motivated by elevating their status than gaining wealth.

Impossible to say exactly. But here’s what we’ve seen in the past: 
So an average crash of around 78% leaves us at around 4,400 from 20,000. But that’s probably a little low in my personal opinion. I would be very surprised if it ever goes much lower than 5,500. But I got no crystal ball. Next hype cycle will be after the next halving at the latest. But I think there’s definitely a decent chance we might get one before then.

Umm, I can think of a few, including bitcoin itself. Bitcoin had lost over 90% of it's value in 2011, and then thrived afterwards to see thousands of percent gains. Did the same thing in 2013, and 2014.
Amazon crashed over 90% (over $100 a share to under $10) in 2001 then went on to see thousands of percent gains as well.
AT&amp;T, IBM, General Motors, Pillsbury, Proctor &amp; Gamble, are all companies that have seen crashes of over 70% and then recovered to see thousands of percent yields post-recovery.
Even the price of gold, considered to be an extremely stable asset, went from over $2000 an ounce down to $300 an ounce (85% crash) during the 80s and 90s, to then completely recover in the 2000s.
And Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology in its development phases. It is an odd technology because it has a currency/asset that anyone can own built into it. It makes complete sense that it would swing wildly like this as it organically develops into something that is used in the mainstream financial markets and builds a more stable market cap.

@_date: 2018-08-12 13:35:20
Not really, there have been services like that for a few years already. BAKKT is essentially just creating a federally regulated market for Bitcoin. The goal is to clear the way for major money managers to offer Bitcoin mutual funds, pension funds, 401(k)s, IRAs, and ETFs, as highly regulated, mainstream investments. But the startup’s plans also raise the prospect of an even more ambitious goal: Using Bitcoin to streamline and disrupt the world of retail payments by moving consumers from swiping credit cards to scanning their Bitcoin apps. The market opportunity is gigantic: Consumers worldwide are paying lofty credit card or online-shopping fees on $25 trillion a year in annual purchases. 
Bakkt’s founders have said that the institutional investor campaign is the first of two phases. They’ve been vague about the second phase but the presence of Starbucks and Microsoft in the project strongly suggests that Bakkt will strive to revolutionize the way consumers pay at physical stores and online. Starbucks is already a leading player in encouraging customers to pay with the their smartphones rather than their credit cards. And Microsoft, through its Azure cloud business, serves a huge base of retailers, handling back-office tasks from invoice processing to e-commerce.

The percentage difference between 100,000 and 10,000 is the same as 100 and 10, or 10 and 1, or 1,000 and 100 etc... 
The log chart makes bitcoin’s long term price movements easier to read and it is a common tool used by analysts for the reasons already stated. If you’re looking at short term price movements (a couple years or less) then linear is fine. But look at bitcoin’s total price history on a linear graph: 
It’s just a flat line, and the last hype cycle looks like the only price movement, when you in reality it isn’t even the largest one by percentage. In the log chart you can easily make out every major price movement in bitcoin’s history. I dunno what else to tell you, really not sure how it’s not obvious that the log chart makes more sense when looking at bitcoin’s total price history. Almost every bitcoin charting website or charting software has a logarithmic view for looking at larger timescales for this reason.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:39:18
You misunderstood me. I'm saying on a linear chart you can't see the past price movements. Everything prior to the last hype cycle just looks like a flat line, which it isn't. There have been 4 other major hype cycles before this one which saw drops of well over 80%. The log chart shows all the pumps and crashes that have happened over the course of bitcoin's history very clearly. A linear chart only shows the latest one, everything before it is a flat line.
\&gt; Assets are not shown on a log chart unless you are trying to shrink the y movements dramatically. 
That's not true. When an asset goes from being worth less than a penny to over $10,000.00 (over 7 orders of magnitude in less than 10 years) and the vast majority of that movement happens over a handful of week or month long spurts peppered across the x-axis (time), a log chart helps visualize what was going on. Investors often use log charts to visualize long term charts like this for the reasons I've already mentioned.

Yes,  around the year 2140, unless some unforeseen reason arises that convinces people we need to change the mining reward protocols. And we can presume that after the last bitcoin has been mined, it will be forever the last bitcoin mined. I can’t really think of any reason right now (given what we know at this time) why there would need to be more coins created after the last one.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:09:19
The key is to not invest more than you are willing to lose (like 5-10% of your investment portfolio is what I would personally recommend) and just sit on it for at least 3-4 years and then reassess at that time whether you want to take some profits or not. If there were no profits then reassess whether or not you think its a worthwhile asset to continue holding.

People were getting over hyped and their expectations got out of hand. I honestly thought it was going to crash and enter an extended bear market before hitting 15k, taking us down to around 3-4k and then next hype cycle is when we'd start seeing 100k figures. I don't think there has been a bitcoin hype cycle that went directly through 2 orders of magnitude higher than the previous all time high, so that isn't something I would ever expect to see, but who knows. Either way, it will get there eventually and those who are patient will be rewarded.

Which chart visualizes the price movements of bitcoin better. 
This one: 
Or this one: 
The first one (the linear graph) you can basically only make out the past year, and everything before it is a flat line, dwarfed by the last hype cycle. With the log chart every price movement over bitcoin’s entire history is very legible. You can actually see all the past hype cycles.

Well, people thought the same thing when they bought at 30 and it droppped to 2 (June 2011), and again when they bought at 200 and it dropped to 70 (april 2013), and again when they bought at 1,100 and it dropped to 180 (2014-2015). Now, those who bought at $30, and didn't sell out of fear/anxiety when it went down to $2, and held all this time have seen 25,000% gains. Now the real question is, did you buy more than you can afford to lose? Did you invest more than 10% of your net worth? Cause if you didn't, and you wisely heeded the advice of pretty much every bitcoin analyst, then it shouldn't be hard to just hold until the next hype cycle.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:14:32
That seems extremely conservative. I expect to see 80k within the next 2-3 years.

It’s a log chart. It’s used pretty frequently for things like bitcoin where many orders of magnitude need to be represented and visualized. Looking at bitcoin price history on a linear chart is ridiculous because whatever the last hype cycle was is the only thing you can see on it and everything before it just looks like a flat line, which it’s not. This graphic shows the power of a log chart. You can plainly see every past hype cycle.

But projects like BAKKT are hoping to eventually get there. Their second phase is basically that, to create an easy on ramp for retailers to provide a point of sale system that accepts bitcoin. And the fact that ICE (the parent company of the NYSE) are the ones doing this is pretty insane news. They are one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world.

@_date: 2018-08-09 18:53:25
You're not wrong. Bitcoin's market cap is still extremely low compared to its foreseeable potential though. And that potential could be reached in fairly short period of time. Put just 5-10% of your total allotted investment funds in bitcoin and the rest in blue chips and whatever safer assets you choose, you will likely have a portfolio that performs better than if you didn't put that 5-10% in bitcoin. And in the off chance that bitcoin never has another hype cycle and continues to drop with no rebound, your portfolio has only performed 5% less well than it could have, which isn't that big of a deal. It is a asymmetric high risk investment and should be treated as such.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:44:46
When something keeps crashing and then rebounds to massive new heights over and over again, it kind of becomes a boy who cried wolf scenario. Sure, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results", but come on, bitcoin's fundamentals are better now then they ever have been. It's pretty obvious that the market got over hyped, too much money poured in at once, now we are seeing a major correction and reconsolidation, much like we've seen time and time before. Weak hands get scared and shaken loose, exacerbating the market crash. But things are happening that I personally never thought we'd see. Like ICE creating a federally-regulated crypto ecosystem allowing for a simple point of sale solution for big companies to accept bitcoin (BAKKT). This is huge news, they plan to have it rolled out by November. If you're paying attention to what's going on, to think bitcoin won't recover is more naive than to think it will.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:29:56


Still condescending and arrogant. Also, you have absolutely no idea who I am or how intelligent I am. Making personal attacks in a debate that has nothing to do with our character is an unintelligent strategy, in my opinion.


I never made any claim that they any bearing on today. I was just saying that bitcoin's price movements don't look like the rollercoaster in the gif at all. The roller coaster in the gif ends lower than it started. Bitcoin is orders of magnitude higher then where it started. Even if that starting position was only a bit over a year ago. I also said that a logarithmic chart makes more sense when looking at bitcoin price history because you can actually see all of its price movements. Nothing beyond that, I would never try and claim that the log chart could be extrapolated, that is certainly foolish.


I'm discounting a 70% drop in price because I've seen it happen several times now and my investments still end up growing in the long term. And that is something that the log chart actually does show. Maybe this time is different, I certainly cant say for sure, but if anything fundamentals are better now than they ever have been during any previous market crash, so I have no reason to be all that alarmed. Like ICE creating a federally-regulated crypto ecosystem allowing for a simple point of sale solution for big companies to accept bitcoin (BAKKT). This is huge news, they plan to have it rolled out by November. If you're paying attention to what's going on, to think bitcoin won't recover is more naive than to think it will. The market got over hyped, too much money poured in at once, the price climb didn't follow the natural growth of the asset, and now we are seeing a major correction and reconsolidation, much like we've seen time and time before. Weak hands get scared and shaken loose, exacerbating the market crash. But its recovered every other time, so tell me one good reason why I should think this time is any different? Besides the obvious "past performance is no guarantee of future results" we all already know that.

Why not coinbase? Probably the best option for you. When you're ready to get the cash you can sell the bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX) as a limit or stop order (so you pay no fee) and then send it to your bank account (which is also free). Allows you to accept payments and convert to fiat completely fee-free.

Fundamentals are not where they were in 2014 at all. I don't remember major financial institutions like Intercontinental Exchange (the owners of the NYSE) creating 2nd layer bitcoin solutions for point of sale integration. I don't remember major news networks featuring bitcoin as a staple conversation in their financial network broadcasts, even running cryptocurrencies in their stock tickers. I don't remember the lightning network, at all. I don't remember congresspeople declaring that they have crypto holdings. In 2014 the mainstream laughed at cryptocurrencies. Now big financial players are actually finding use cases for them and it seems like bitcoin is making a place for itself in international finance, which in the end is, unfortunately, what decides whats valuable and what gets adopted. Set a remind me for 4 years from now and lets talk some more then.


Bitcoin wasn't meant to do anything other than be an immutable censor resistant and permissionless ledger. It can and should be used by anybody for whatever purpose they so choose.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:33:08
When people talk about bitcoin fundamentals they are talking about adoption, integration, infrastructure building, 2nd layer application development, etc... Things that show the technology is growing in either use or utility, basically. For example:
The announcement that ICE (who own the NYSE) is creating a federally-regulated crypto ecosystem allowing for a simple point of sale solution for big companies to accept bitcoin. They are calling it BAKKT, and they are saying they've been working on it quietly for a while and should be ready to roll it out in November. 
The fact that Lightning Network is now running on mainnet and growing quickly in capacity, and people are developing apps that run on it.
The fact that more and more people are using bitcoin as part of their investment portfolios. And more and more people are using it for remittences as well.
Goldman Sachs, one of the top ten biggest institutional investors in the world, recently announced plans for a ‘Crypto Custody’ offering.
These are the kind of things people are talking about when referring to "bitcoin fundamentals". Bitcoin isn't a company, nor a stock. It is a digital money that is built into and inseparable from a payment processor, something we've never seen before, so it can't be judged using the same methods as the more traditional assets that we're used to. This is why price discovery has been so wildly volatile with bitcoin, because it something completely fresh and new and no one really knows how to value it yet, although some people are coming up with some pretty good metrics. Also volatile because of its relatively minuscule market cap, obviously. I strongly suggest checking out these two articles for a more in depth analysis on bitcoin valuation. The first one covers interesting new methods for calculating its value, the second one breaks down how bitcoin has intrinsic value:
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:18:15

Yea, I'm not talking about breaking even. In three years people who bought at the previous all time high ($1,200) saw potential gains of nearly 2000%. People who bought at the previous all time high before that one saw the same thing if they held through the crash to that next all time high. Not saying it's a guaranteed fact that this will happen again, but I personally think it is more likely that it will then it won't, considering the health of bitcoin's fundamental right now are much much greater then they were during the last crash, or the crash before that one, or the crash before that one.

almkglor's response is spot on. To add to what they already mentioned, the Bitcoin network also has an enormous amount of hash power behind it. I don't think any alt coins will ever come close to catching up with it. For example the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap is Ethereum whose hash rate is a bit under 300 TH/s. Bitcoin's hash rate is a little over 50,000,000 TH/s. Completely blows the closest competition's hashing power out of the water by many orders of magnitude. The reason why this is so important is that the higher the hashing power a cryptocurrency's network has the more secure and resistant to attacks it is. Security is the number one most important aspect of a cryptocurrency. This sort of a network effect has already placed Bitcoin in a "too big to fail" (literally and figuratively) position. This, plus what almkglor said about how Bitcoin is an open-source protocol that is flexible can evolve and adopt any newer innovations as the industry advances, is what basically makes Bitcoin the one and only blockchain needed. Why make a new alt coin when anyone can just implement their new idea to the largest and best blockchain out there? It's not a private company like Myspace or Facebook, where developers are hired to try and make a better product than the other company. It is an open-source software where people voluntarily add their code to further innovate a tool with no single creator, owner, ceo, board of directors, etc... And for blockchain applications that don't really make sense to build directly into the Bitcoin protocol, you can just build a 2nd layer application on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that leverages its hash power and network to fulfill whatever alternate use case you're trying to acheive, just like anyone can build an application on top of TCP/IP.

Actually, I think they have plans to also offer custodial accounts for people’s bitcoins. And I would imagine that would mean they would have everything insured just like a bank, so losses, theft, and fraud would be covered. So you can choose to use them kind of like a spend account, and use your personal hardware wallet (or whatever else allows you to control your own keys) as your savings and only spend from your insured BAKKT account.
As far as the hoarding issue goes. I think bitcoin’s exponential rise will eventually start to flatten out as its market cap rises. That’s probably partially why phase one for BAKKT is to get bitcoin into institutional funds (IRAs, ETFs, etc...) because that will give large institutional investors an onramp allowing for massive influx of capital getting bitcoin to that stable position of a large market cap asset quicker.

Yea for sure. It’s the Winklevoss exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:34:03
Because it makes more sense when looking at bitcoin's total long-term price history. When an asset goes from being worth less than a penny to over $10,000.00 (over 7 orders of magnitude in less than 10 years) and the vast majority of that movement happens over a handful of week or month long spurts peppered across the x-axis (time), a log chart helps visualize what was going on, otherwise all the price history before the last major movement just looks like a flat line, which it isn't.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:12:52
Yea, of course, but that doesn’t mean the upside isn’t still asymmetric. The market cap of bitcoin is still insanely low at only 100b when comparing it to the market cap of other highly sought after financial assets.
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:23:21
Here, this chart shows exactly why a log chart makes more sense when looking at a price chart like bitcoin’s. It allows you to actually see the price movements over its entire history clearly. Where the big over valuations occurred, how long their corrections lasted, and how severe they were:

This one:
Or this one:
Notice how the first one just shows a flat line until the last hype cycle. The last hype cycle was so many orders of magnitude larger than the 3 before that it dwarfs them into a flat line. A logarithmic graph allows you to see the detail in all the orders of magnitude as the price goes through them. It just makes more sense, period. Not sure where the naivety comes into play.

I'm not even close to being a kid, addressing me as "kiddo" is condescending and arrogant, and this "ride" has been by a long shot the best "ride" I've ever taken. Bitcoin is up 1000% from two years ago, and over 20,000% since I started accumulating. Log charts aren't "distorted", they are common practice in finance when plotting anything long term. And you can't tell me the price movements are easier to visualize on the linear chart because you can't even see them on that chart, at all, so that proves to me that your just full of it.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:22:22
Totally. But a rational person would have taken a low risk position of around 5% or so of their portfolio so that in case it didn't work out for them they would have a huge loss on their hands. Which is good. If bitcoin failed, which it could have, and you had most of your portfolio in it, you'd be screwed. If you invested a large portion of your portfolio in it and it didn't fail, doesn't mean you made a wise investment, that's just survivorship bias.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:14:43
I think bitcoin won't be stable until it reaches a market cap of several trillion dollars and it becomes a mainstream financial tool that is in most people's portfolio in some form. Knowing when to sell is impossible, my personal opinion is invest a small percentage of portfolio in it, let it sit there a few years, and then reassess. Either it will have gone up a lot, or it will have lost some value. Either way it has a lot more room to go up then to go down. That makes it an asymmetric investment, which is good, but it is also high risk, hence why you should only allot a small percentage (like 5%) of your portfolio in it. If it loses a lot of value, it won't negatively affect your overall portfolio much. If it goes another 1,000-5,000% it will greatly affect your portfolio in a positive direction (hence it is an asymmetric investment vehicle).
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:56:17
When you have billions of dollars, a few million dollars is like a few hundred dollars for someone with $100,000 in savings when comparing the order of magnitudes. and for someone with even just $100,000,000 (lot more of those in the world than billionaires) a few million is like a few thousand. So just keep that in mind. Not to mention the kind of cash flow generated by putting that kind of money in dividend paying investments. You get millions every year for nothing but leaving some capital invested in some assets.

Why would you doubt it? Almost anyone with experience with investing in this market has said it will. And if you look at bitcoin’s history it has recovered from and reached new levels of magnitude in price after larger drops than this one on multiple occasions. Logically it seems more likely to recover and reach new heights than not.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:36:58
People once bought at $20 and then it dropped to $1. That's a much worse loss. What if that was you and you sold it all at $6 never to rebuy again cause it always looked "overpriced"

Sure, anyone with half a wit that's willing to do a little bit of research can quadruple their money easily in stocks during a bull market (which we've been in for the past 10 years almost). My stock portfolio has been doing great since 2008, and I too have tripled or quadrupled my investments since then. But stocks also bubble and pop. I saw people lose all the profits they made in stock investments during the 2008 recession. But regardless, my bitcoin investment has made me 250x gains in 5 years, and is at a point now where those investments will probably never be in the red again. 250x makes quadrupling look like nothing. What started as a 5% allocation of my net worth has now mushroomed into more than half of my net worth, in just 5 years. That's almost unheard of in any traditional investing.

You're ignoring the possibility that all these services could be replaced by decentralized apps, protocols, a network of peer-to-peer lending services, etc... Or if not that, the ability for banks to adapt, or  the innovation of unforeseeable products and technologies to fit whatever needs are required by the people inspired by whatever the prevailing paradigm of the time is. Making any kind of basic prediction like this from our completely ignorant 2018 perspective is kind of silly when regarding a technology as nascent and groundbreaking as Bitcoin. So many possibilities in the ever shifting sands of time.
I for one certainly find it ridiculous when I have to deal with the inefficiencies and clunkiness of the legacy banking system now that I've had a taste for the elegance of using Bitcoin for transacting. And I was raised and lived most my adult life thus far on legacy banking, so I'm used to it. When I imagine a kid who's raised with access to bitcoin, using the legacy banking system will be like trying to get the kid to use postal mail instead of email, text messaging, or social media to keep in touch with his out of town friends. Or trying to get the kid to go buy a CD at a brick and mortar music store instead of just streaming albums on Spotify. People will always choose the more efficient means to their end. People, in general, almost always take the path of least resistance.

But it is the logical way to present bitcoin’s lifelong price chart for the reasons stated. Because it’s value has increased by many orders of magnitude over the course of its history. Bitcoin’s price history is logarithmic in nature. It is extremely common among people who analyze bitcoin’s valuation over the course of anything more than a few years to use a log chart, again, because it’s impossible to visualize price movements beyond the past hype cycle because they are so dwarfed by it. Bitcoin’s price moves parabolically in short bursts so it makes more sense to lay out the data logarithmically.

It's called a logarithmic chart. Almost every charting software has an option for a logarithmic view, it isn't anything out of the ordinary. They are often used when a variable spans several orders of magnitude (like in the case of bitcoin). In these cases it is often easier on the eyes, and more informative, to visualize data on a log scale. Looking at bitcoin's entire price history makes no sense on a linear scale. You can't even see the price movements that happened prior to the last hype cycle because they are so dwarfed by it.
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:31:34
That’s a false equivalency. It’s actually more like leaving $250k cash in a cheap safe in your backyard. But my point still stands. Just because the temptation is there doesn’t mean it’s still not on the perpetrator to be responsible enough not to give into their temptation and do the right thing.

What’s up with everyone freaking out about the log chart? Analysts have been using log charts to look at bitcoin price history for years and I’ve never seen anyone find it unusual before. The log chart makes way more sense in this scenario because of how many order of magnitudes the price has gone through over the years. Which is exactly what log charts are for, so you can see data movements at every level more clearly. Linear charts make no sense when looking at bitcoin over the course of anything more than a few years, the price movements of the last hype cycle dwarf everything before it into a flat line, which it isn’t.

That being said. As long as you write down the seed phrase for your Nano X, it doesn't really matter how "fidgety" the device is, because the crypto isn't "in" the Nano X, it's "in" the seed phrase. The device could glitch out and spontaneously combust, as long as you have your seed phrase you still have the crypto.

I think it’s always been this way though. Even before there was money and all we needed was food, water and shelter, getting any one of those things relies almost solely on your position. This is just the nature of life. E.g. If you have positioned yourself in a banana tree at the moment the bananas have ripened, and you got there before any other banana eating creature, you get free food (or “money”). The trick has always been about getting in the right positions at the right times. Electronic trading just allows people to do this in an exceedingly efficient manner.

Worth mentioning: 
There's nothing wrong with reading/watching mainstream media. But it is important to keep a few things in mind when reading/watching any media in general, mainstream or not:
Are there advertisements? Then the main intent of the media provider is to garnish viewership so they can charge more for the advertisement slots. Their main focus will be to entertain you or grab your attention in some way. Flashy headlines and hyperbolic writing. Read the news from this publisher with this in mind. No advertisements? Then the main intent of the media provider is probably to push some kind of agenda, usually political or an attempt to manipulate some market sector. Look up the owner of this media outlet, learn about who they are to determine what agenda they may have, and read the news with this bias in mind. Most news sources will pursue all these agendas at once, regardless of advertising, because political control has value in the same way capital controls do, in a democratic capitalist system. They will also have some sort of incentive to present accurate news in order to maintain some sliver of credibility or respect, but this is only secondary to the aforementioned intentions. We can look at the success of tabloid new outlets as a perfect example of how accuracy is of little importance in media. And I do mean all media, not just mainstream. We live in a capitalist world. Primary objectives all boil down to financial profitability. And nobody with the resources to actually create accurate news media will spend those resources unless they can guarantee profitability as an outcome. Why would some "alternative news" provider spend the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on audio equipment, film equipment, computers, web developers, reporters, etc... if they aren't getting some sort of return on their investment? Not to mention the hundreds or thousands of hours of work it takes to run such an operation. 
Best practice is to read news from all sources with their respective biases in mind. Use their various biases to cancel out everything that is a manipulation and fluff, and dig the truth out from them. And when reading the news try to dig into the sources of the information. Is it from academic papers? Wikileaks? Some commercially published literature like a book? Publicized court documents? An anonymous confidant? Etc... And then analyze how credible that source is. If the information has no sources, then the information is being pulled out of the writer's ass and can be disregarded as nothing but some fun ideas to think about. Basically, all news is just taking some source information, unpacking and simplifying it, and then padding it with a bunch of fluff to make it entertaining and/or play to our basic emotions.

It’s implying that there seems to be a developing pattern. The pattern has only shown 2 cycles so far, so it may not be a pattern, but could be one in development. If it is a pattern, the likelihood of which may be high, then we should expect to see another market spike sometime after the next halvening. If that happens, the pattern would be validated until history shows a break in the pattern.
Obviously before the climb to 20k there wasn’t that historical data to plug into the chart to say that a pattern may be developing. Now we have that information, and charting it shows that there could be a pattern forming here.
That is what the graph shows, and is implying.

I don't know if "spend" is the right word. More like converting your USD into BTC. Basically, instead of storing your value in something that is guaranteed to lose value every year, but also has the backing of the most powerful nation state and has been around 200+ years (the USD), you would now be storing your value a nascent currency that so far has shown astronomical returns year-over-year, but is also very new so considered somewhat high risk (BTC). So the answer to your question would depend on how risk-averse you are. At the same time, $1000 is a very small amount of money and would probably be easy enough to replace if (god forbid) the bitcoin experiment fails. So I would probably say: just exchange the $1000 for the ~0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:16:21

But gold has been valued by humankind for literally thousands of years, going back to Egyptians and Mesopotamians, (tens of thousands maybe even, flakes of gold were found in Paleolithic caves dating back as far as 40,000 B.C., but not enough evidence to suggest value). It is considered a fairly stable and low-risk asset, and is known to perform very well in recessions.
But bitcoin... it just hit it's 10-year anniversary. I love bitcoin and think the technology, in tandem with the internet, will change the world in ways we have yet to even conceive of. But at the moment it is still considered a highly volatile and risky asset class. Usually, in a recession, the investments with highest risk are liquidated first and reallocated elsewhere. This means bitcoin would probably lose value in a recession. Although, most bitcoin holders at this point are long term investors, who may not be easily shaken, so we will see. Either way, I am excited for bitcoin to survive its first recession, whether or not it performs well during it doesn't really matter if you are a long term investor. It will surely survive and come out the other side stronger than ever.

There are four stages that all market-based monetary goods pass through in their evolution to becoming a fully fledged money:

We’re currently somewhere in the collectible -&gt; store of value stage. Maybe even almost fully in store of value stage at this point.
Would be smart to at least hold until fully in the medium of exchange stage.

First of all, I don’t think this is idealist thinking at all. What bitcoin will do (or has done already, arguably) to our ability to bank ourselves independent of a 3rd party (a bank) isn’t much different than what the internet did to allow us to communicate to the masses independent of a 3rd party (a mass media outlet). It’s a pretty reasonable and likely outcome.
Secondly, what are you even talking about? Who are the 6 billion unbanked reliant on? If anything, it’s the opposite: the 1 billion+ of us “banked” individuals that are reliant on the banks. And only those that are scared to use bitcoin instead, because of the amount of personal responsibility it requires, can be accused of wanting to continue being reliant. Until someone is given the chance to prove they are ready to be self reliant in banking themselves, you cannot accuse that individual or group of the things you’re accusing them of. Beyond that, your comments are an incredible generalization, bitcoin has its own use cases from individual to individual, and it’s up to that individual how, why, or if they want to use it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:42:10
Kind of semantic nitpicking. When someone days "my car's engine died" or "the battery in my phone is dying" they're not trying to say those things are dying in a literal sense, it's just a figure of speech. When I said "everything is slowly dying", I was using the word in a similar way. The universe is an isolated system and it adheres to the laws of thermodynamics. Therefore the entire universe's entropy is always increasing. The universe is slowly approaching a steady state. Eventually reaching heat death (even the cosmological term for this state uses the word death) at which point the universe has finally settled down near completely, and the universe becomes an inanimate and motionless place with no activity. Hence "Everything is slowly dying."
So if you are trying to say that the second law of thermodynamics doesn't explain why we believe the universe is on this path to eventual nothingness, then I'm sorry, you're just wrong. Or at best you're pigeonholing the law.

I never said it was mysterious. I've only stated that it is a fact of the universe and nothing more or less. And saying "entropy only increases" is pretty much the same thing as saying "isolated systems fall apart and decay overtime." The Oxford English Dictionary definition of entropy is:
 1) A thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system.
2) Lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.
So you're basically arguing "disorder only increases" vs "order only decreases"

Bitcoin wasn’t premined. The moment it was created anyone could download Satoshi’s open source program and start mining the coins themselves. Not many people did this because no one really cared about bitcoin at the time, it was also pretty difficult to use the early incarnation of the program unless you were skilled in computer science. But, the option was there, so it cannot be considered premined. A premined cryptocurrency, by definition, means that only a select person or group of people were granted access to the mining software before access was granted to the public.
This makes a difference to people because a coin that’s heavily premined means that (usually) the creator of the cryptocurrency holds the large majority of the tokens. This means that they can influence the market much more than anyone else, and they could potentially dump all the coins after pumping the price up, exploiting the market for personal gain. That being said, just because a coin is premined doesn’t mean it’s a scam. Crypto developers are generally pretty transparent about their premining, and it’s probably a good thing for the developers to have a sizable stake in their project since that gives them more incentive to work hard making it as successful as possible.
A cryotocurrency that isn’t premined, though, has pretty much no reason to be looked at skeptically, because there isn’t really any way for the creator to exploit its value anymore than anyone else. Whereas a cryptocurrency that’s been premined should be looked at with a bit more scrutiny.

Yes, store of value. Dollars are inflationary, bitcoin is disinflationary. That means eventually, assuming bitcoin doesn't fail (which at this point seems extremely unlikely) it has to reach a billion dollars just by the effects of economic forces. Although at that point the dollar will be much weaker than it is today. I think over a million in todays dollar value is possible. But a billion seems unlikely, although maybe in a couple hundred years it could be possible if population growth continues at these kind of rates.

The reason bitcoin was originally created was simply to be a digital currency with similar transacting properties as physical cash (pseudonymous, permissionless, irreversible, etc...) but with the benefit of being able to transact with it digitally and over the internet. Beyond that basic purpose, no one was told how they *have* to use it, or for what reasons they *should* be involved. In fact, the freedom to use it in whatever capacity you want is at the core of Bitcoin’s ethos, and part of what makes it such a great technology. You want to use it as a digital peer-to-peer cash system? Great, that’s what it was designed for. You want to use it for remittances? That’s cool too. You want to use it as a cryptographically secure store of value that you have full sovereign ownership and control over? Awesome. You want to use it to permanently write censorship resistant information to a decentralized and immutable database? Go for it. You want to use it as a speculative investment, day trade it, do whatever Wall Street bs with it? You can do that too if you like. It’s an open source protocol, a public utility, and people can use it for whatever they want. This is an all inclusive party, everyone is invited, and the more people that join in, for whatever reasons they want, the stronger it becomes because of it. And btw, there are still plenty of people, and growing, that are “in it for the tech” also.

First of all, I absolutely understand the value proposition of bitcoin, so don’t put words in my mouth. I also understand what a medium of exchange is, and bitcoin isn’t quite one yet, but it’s getting there.
There are four stages that all market-based monetary goods pass through in their evolution to becoming a fully fledged money:
1. Collectible
2. Store of Value
3. Medium of exchange
4. Unit of account
Bitcoin is still in the SOV stage creeping into the MOE stage.


USDs are the only medium of exchange in the USA, Euros are the only medium of exchange in Europe, etc... A medium of exchange only needs to be widely accepted amongst those who you most transact with. My actual definition was “A medium of exchange needs to be a medium that a wide majority of the people you WANT (emphasis here) to transact with are going to accept in the exchange.” If you go to Europe and want to transact with people there, you’re gong to have to go convert your USDs for the local medium of exchange, of course.

The tech is still insanely nascent. People started developing the technology for the internet in the early 80s. So when the internet was only 10 years old (early 90s) the kinds of things you're saying could have been (and was) said about it, too. Did that mean it was bad tech that was going nowhere? Anyone that understood the implication of the internet in the early 90s, and saw the kind of development going on, knew it was destined to change the world. Bitcoin just turned 10-years old. Everyone who understands the implications of this technology, and sees the kind of development going on, is extremely excited about it because they know it will change the world, also.

I'm a fan of Coinbase Pro, it is my preferred exchange in the US. Has a spotless record when it comes to security, and the lowest fees besides Binance (and the difference between their fees is only like 0.05% or something trivially small like that). So that would be the first on my list.
Second would be Gemini. Has an equally spotless record as Coinbase, and who doesn't love the Winklevii. Fees are quite a bit higher though, otherwise they'd be 
Kraken would be third. Also has a pretty spotless record.
I know these may not be the simplest to use, especially for someone who has never done any trading before at all, but they are the best and have the lowest fees, and are worth learning how to use (it's really not that hard, just look up the difference between a market order, stop loss, and a limit order and you're pretty much good to go). If you want something a child could use and don’t mind paying around 20x more on fees, then I'd suggest Coinbase or Cash App (mobile phone apps).

Because Coinbase, and any exchange that anyone has their coins on, has your bitcoin, not you. You can ask Coinbase at any point to send the bitcoin they hold for you to an address you control the keys to, but what if they don't send them? This has happened many times with many exchanges in the past. Look up the fall of Mt Gox, it's the most famous case of this happening.
Anyways, Coinbase (and a few other exchanges, including Kraken) have incredibly spotless reputations, and are probably safe. But every exchange is solvent, until it isn't. And once we know it isn't, it's already too late. These exchanges are constantly under attack, because they are massive honeypots. In some cases, depending how much bitcoin you have, it might make more sense to hold your own keys and store/secure them yourself.

And the internet also asked society, the world, to change what they know for it. The internet was a huge change to the status quo, and is still changing the way we do things to this day. As Uber squashes the taxi industry, we're asking people to change the way they get rides. It would be much harder to function in today's world if you never took the time to learn how to use the internet. Anyways, nobody is being forced to change anything at this point, if you want to use traditional banking, that option will likely always be there, or at least for a long long time. Just because I can read the news and watch movies on my phone doesn't mean we got rid of all our magazines/newspapers and cinemas.
We are currently at the equivalent of 1980's internet development when it comes to bitcoin development (roughly 10 years after initial inception). Nobody was using the internet for anything more than testing the concepts of sending information through a network. Bitcoin should be looked at the same way. Most people aren't using it for much more than messing around with the base concepts of sending around value and storing value [edit:] through/in decentralized networks. It will take another couple decades before this system has been adequately fleshed out before people will be using it for anything more than that. And, who knows, it may never get past the store of value stage, and that's fine too. It works wonderfully for that purpose so far.

Alt coins can be thought of as test networks for technologies that bitcoin may adopt later. There is way too much capital on the BTC blockchain at risk to implement new tech onto it without thorough testing. If a new technology is implemented on BTC and it creates an unforeseen point of failure there is over 100 billion dollars of the world's wealth that goes up in smoke. This is why most new technologies that have come to bitcoin (segwit, lightning, etc...) were implemented on alt coins first. If an alt coin has a technology that is shown to to be both worthwhile and bomb proof, it can be applied to bitcoin at any time.

u/Flaveurr mentioned some good hardware wallets. I would add Trezor One and Trezor Model T to that list.

But there are good free options out there also. Like I said:

Privacy coins like Monero are completely anonymous using a protocol that obfuscates the public keys being used in transactions, but still allows the transactions to be verifiable, making it impossible to follow the movement of coins on through the network.
Bitcoin is considered pseudonymous because the public key is not obfuscated and is displayed in plain text on every transaction on the blockchain, permanently. This allows certain analytical data to be done to see the movements of particular coins by following the chain of transactions it goes through.

Ok, 2+2=4 is an abstracted idea that has real world applications, and same thing with the laws of thermodynamics. And yes, it simply means when integers 2 and 2 are combined with an addition operator it equals the integer 4. But I can apply this to a real world situation and say that it explains how when one group of dogs join up with another group of dogs, the combined group of dogs is larger now. I've now said more than what the original 2+2=4 posits, but the underlying concept behind them are the same.
In the same sense, yes the second law of thermodynamics says a very simple and specific thing about the nature of entropy (just like 2+2=4 says a very simple and specific thing about the nature of integers and addition). But its underlying concept can be applied to observable phenomena in the universe, including the fact that any isolated system ultimately falls apart and decays over time. (just like how 2+2=4 can be applied to observable phenomena in the universe, including groups of dogs combining to make a single bigger group)
EDIT: And this has nothing to do with hippies or internet professors. This is just applying abstracted concepts to real world observations.

We should just get rid of the decimal in btc altogether imo, and then just continue calling it bitcoin, cause that’s still what it is. The decimal is really only there conceptually/psychologically anyways, there is really no reason for it mathematically/algorithmically as far as I can tell.
Although I have no problem calling it sats either. But might as well keep the bitcoin name just for recognition.

Yes, of course, Like I said in the comment you are replying to:


But over short periods of time (ie. couple years or less) it holds its value moderately well, and has a certain level of guarantee to hold that value over those short timescales. Unlike other monies, like gold or bitcoin, which can have massive swings in either direction over the course of a year or two. If you are looking for something very stable, to store value in over a short timescale, USD is still probably your best bet right now.

No way, the last bull run that peaked at 1200USD in 2014 didn't even drop below 200USD. So if this bear run sees the same drop in percentage, that gives us a low of roughly 3400USD. I think it's extremely unlikely it will go lower than 6k since that's the cost of mining at the moment. 50USD is pretty much impossible unless this is truly the end. Prices haven't been that low since before the bull run that preceded the one that first went over 1k, back in early 2013.

50k is only a little over twice the previous ATH. In the last hype cycle it would be considered the equivalent of ~3k USD. If anyone sold their BTC  USD in the last bull run, and then tried to buy back at the bottom (which was roughly 4k) they'd have lost BTC. And that's assuming they caught that bottom, more likely they would have waited for it to drop below 3k, and now still be sitting with their USD and BTC now selling  So let's imagine that after selling at 50k, in this hypothetical future, and then BTC goes to 250k+ and then "crashes" to 60k. Now what do you do? Buy back in with the same funds but at a smaller stake? Or wait for that 60k BTC to drop a little further down to your "buy back in point"? But, oops, instead of dropping further, now the price of BTC bounced back up to 150k as it approaches the next halving and subsequent hype cycle.

Yea, but media lives in a click bait world now, and in a sense getting an exchange to deanonymize someone “cracks” their anonymity on althe blockchain. So they are able to use that phrase, even though it kinda implies something more significant. This is a classic tactic nowadays.

Could be tackled on 2nd layer. Send bitcoin to a 2nd layer that transacts with onion routing, send the bitcoin to recipient, if recipient wants to settle on base layer they can, and the source would be completely anonymous, shrouded by the onion routing it transferred through.

Ok, so then it’s a long basically? I just don’t really get how people use it strategically with BTC. It makes sense for physical commodities that either take up storage space or have a shelf life. But for something like BTC, which is just cryptographically secured units in a disributed digital database, why does the delivery date matter strategically?

Did you buy your bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase? If so, did that exchange ask you for your name, email, identification, etc?
Those exchanges must comply with whatever government they operate in’s tax laws. And almost all of them have the identification of all their customers.
Even if you send it to a personal wallet, they can follow it there since the blockchain is public.

But small transactions would almost never be done on the base layer, the fees wouldn’t be worth it. That would be reserved for large movements of capital, like intrabank transfers or estate and company acquisitions. Second layer would be like the equivalent of what cash is now, and yea if I tried to deposit a 5 figure sum of paper cash at my bank, they sure would want to know what the source is. But I can take that cash to any vendors and make anonymous purchases. Same idea with 2nd layer.

A checking account is just an account. The units in the account (assuming USD since its BoA) are money, but the checking account itself is not. Debit cards are just plastic with information on them that allow them to be used like money, assuming the person you are exchanging with has a card reader. I would say they are actually a bit closer to money than a bank account, actually. Bitcoin is a unit of money and a payment system wrapped up together into an open source protocol. C is actually the only correct answer here.

Ok, that’s actually a decent counter argument. Kind of defeats the purpose of using terms like sov and moe at all, though.

Edit: And, subjectively, anything that can be bartered and doesn’t deteriorate over time would be money with sov and moe properties then, right?

Money can absolutely be a store of value without being a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is a function of money that expedites trade between a buyer and seller because it is widely accepted as payment for a good or service. Gold, for example, is a money that is a store of value but not a medium of exchange because it is not widely accepted. I bet 99.999% of stores and vendors will not accept gold if you walked up and tried to buy something from them with it, yet it is most definitely a store of value and a money.

With only $26 I wouldn’t worry too much about this. But if you ever get to a point where you have over at least like $500 you may want to start looking up ways to secure your bitcoin yourself instead of keeping it with a custodian (exchanges like Coinbase or binance are examples). It takes some responsibility and organization, but could be worth it if holding long term. Probably the easiest way is to just buy a hardware wallet or get a good app for your phone. There are plenty of threads about it, just look up “best ways to store your own keys bitcoin reddit” on google and you should find some good ones.

Not necessarily, but potentially. QC technology will only be in the hands of huge and heavily capitalized corporations for the first decade probably. So if you don't get the memo after a decade, then you must not care an awful lot about your bitcoin.


Everything in this whole paragraph is just total garbage. A 51% attack on bitcoin would take an insane amount of resources and would barely accomplish anything. Here's an explanation of how it's pretty much infeasible: 
doing the same to a centralized blockchain with hardly any hash rate and no decentralization would be a piece of cake, though.
If the biggest bitcoin mining facilities got shut down, we would have a temporary slowdown in transactions, and then the difficult would adjust, and everything would be fine.


I've already explained how centralized blockchains cannot guarantee any of this, though. Redundancy, sure, but you can just have your database on RAID 1 set up, achieves the same result, but far more efficient.

Compared to doing anything else on the computer. People still used computers to look at images before there was an internet. But they usually loaded them off of cd-roms or floppy discs, which only took a few seconds at most. And people looked at pictures before there were computers too, like in magazines, or photo albums, which also only took a few seconds at most. So I guess, really, just in comparison to other experiences of looking at things. You don't need a faster internet to realize your waiting a long time for something. Just like when I go to the amusement park, the lines always take forever, and I don't need to experience a quick line at the amusement park to understand that amusement park lines are slow.

Salary doesn't mean shit to someone like Bezos, who is worth over 100 billion dollars. A hundred thousand bucks to someone with that much money is the relative wealth equivalent of a few cents to the average American. Of course he has some bs just-for-show salary. Steve Jobs' salary when he was CEO of Apple was a literal single dollar. This is actually somewhat common for CEOs with massive net worths. Either way, Bezos is a complete outlier, being the single richest person in the world. And he isn't someone to admire, either. The company he created and leads is killing independent small business around the world, especially in America. Not to mention how terrible the working conditions are for its employees, and the amount of exploitation that goes on there. Amazon is like Walmart on steroids.
Anyways, let's look at the AVERAGE salary for CEOs, rather than cherry picking some outlier. According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO pay is 271 times the nearly $58,000 annual average pay of the typical American worker. Although the 271:1 ratio is high, it’s still not as high as in previous years. In 2015, CEOs made 286 times the salary of a typical worker and 299 times more in 2014. Compare that to 1978, when CEO earnings were roughly 30 times the typical worker’s salary. And the 1950s, when it was just 20 times the typical worker’s salary.
Shit like this is what is causing the wealth gap in this country, and around the world. Yea, of course the CEO deserves to get paid a lot more than the average worker in their company, like you said, they're who "orchestrates and puts the whole damn thing together". But it's gotten out of control. 30 or even 50 times more? Totally reasonable. But nearly 300 times more?! That is just unethical. That means for every single day a CEO works they make nearly as much as a typical worker in their company makes in an entire year of work. How can anyone defend that?
By the way, I am part owner of one business, run my own separate personal business, and have a full-time job. So, I don't need another one, but thanks.

Ok, a penny is 1% of a dollar, not 0.000001%. It isn't comparable at all. 0.000001% is such a small percentage it isn't easy for one to wrap their head around. 1%, however, is a very natural number for people to grasp and we use it on a near daily basis.
In addition. when the single units of your currency are so small and represent such a tiny value, using percentages is no longer necessary. The Japanese yen is a great example of this. It really just makes way more sense in every way, not sure why all the downvotes. Someone please provide to me a single purpose the decimal serves in BTC?

Odds of going to 1k are far lower than going to 15k, especially considering we were practically at 15k just a few months ago. My personal opinion, I think odds of going to 1k are more on level with odds of going to 1million.
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:04:00
Even that I'd disagree with. Going to 1k would go sub ATH from 2014, that's just super unlikely. Going over 20k is only ~100% increase, BTC does that in its sleep. Maybe I went a little too far with 1m, but I'd say at the very least 0.5m has equal likelihood as 1k, that puts it at a price higher than the various current analyses predicts post halving (stock-to-flow, rainbow charts, comparisons to gold market cap, etc... all have BTC reaching a new ATH in the 80-350k range by 2022). I don't think I've seen any analysis that shows BTC going to sub 2014 ATH prices, and seems way out of character when looking at BTC historically. Of course, BTC is a very new asset and all this is highly speculable, but just looking at the numbers these are the conclusions I come to.

All that happened after the $1200 ath. It took almost 3 years before the graph above shows it hitting 1k for the first time afterwards. It was such an insanely long period of uncertainty. I’m sure many people assumed we’d never see another ath again. When it hit 1000 that day, I think we all knew a new ath would be just around the corner. And low and behold, 3 months later, it went over 1200ath, and then after a quick little drop, shit exploded into the moon.

Two very valid concerns. I could also add:
3) Mining, and therefore the security of the network, will be under the control of a handful of very successful tech companies that must meet a minimum resource requirement. Allowing for possible insider colluding, and limiting the strength of the network against attacks.
4) The companies that want to mine it have to pay a large up front fee in order for the privilege. Also, they don't get any return on their investment until operating costs are covered. This will lead to those companies having a huge vested interest in Libra's usage over other cryptos, possibly causing conflicts of interest and non-compete issues, and eventually leading to unethical behavior at the expense of the consumer.
5) Open to manipulation by those behind the scenes. "The money used to buy in is used for investments by founding members. Sounds like a nice cash grab scam." at worst, yes, and at best this is just fractional reserve banking with a cryptocurrency whose value is backed by gov't currencies that are also fractionally reserved. So now we're talking about fractions of fractional reserves, lol.

Because of network effect and the security provided by massive hash rates. You need to stop trying to compare bitcoin to previous prices. The value will only go up over longterm, and you can buy bitcoins in units as small as USD$0.0001. Start stacking your sats now before its $90,000 per bitcoin, or $900,000 per bitcoin. Even at the insane price of $1m per bitcoin, the smallest unit will still only cost a penny.

How so? 
Bitcoin resides solely on nodes that are all synced through the internet, and it was created in an open source collaboration coordinated via the internet. Contributions can be made by any contributing internet user as long as their contribution is accepted by the consensus of other bitcoin users running nodes on the internet. Bitcoin is, unarguably, *the* currency *of* the internet.
The USD was not created on the internet, through the internet, by internet users. So it is not *of* the internet. It is *of* the US government, or more accurately, it is *of* the Federal Reserve Bank and *enforced by* the US government. 
Just because you can use USDs on the internet does not make it *the currency of the internet*.

Just hoarding as store of value. What we cash it out for is irrelevant. Nobody holds onto a store of value just for the sake of holding it, the intention is always to use that value for something you actually want or need later. You could be hoarding fiat just to cash it out for a down payment on a house later. But it may not hold its value as well as other SoVs, so some people hoard other things that they think will store their value better.

Not if you look at historical trends.

I agree with some of what you’re saying. But the fact that you caught a low and a high and made decent profits on it holds a little bit of survivorship bias to it. For the average person, it is a better strategy to buy and hold long term, like 10 years or more, or at least 5 minimum.

Cause from my perspective, it just looks pretty pathetic. The fact that you were so worried about your position that you liquidated your high risk asymmetric investment so early, shows that you must not have a whole lot of additional capital laying around. Or maybe you’re just doing it wrong. A 5x gain isn’t even that difficult to achieve in much less risky investments, like catching a stock position in a solid company on the rise. Not until you’re dropping 5 to 6 figures into long term high risk assets and not even caring if they go to zero, but also not liquidating until you see close to 100x returns, are you maybe allowed to belittle people about their “peasant money”. Until then, you’re a peasant just like rest. But, enjoy your profits, I shouldn’t shit on your come-ups. Here you go, a gold star for your big-boy money 5x gains:��

Everything you said is just flat out false:
You can spend it at many online shops and services: overstock[dot]com for goods, microsoft[dot]com for software, namecheap[dot]com for web hosting, nordvpn[dot]com for VPN services, in addition to probably thousands of independent online merchants. There are also thousands of private brick and mortar businesses around the world that accept bitcoin as well. Here's a map where you can find places that accept bitcoin near you: 
There are many websites at which you can lend your bitcoins and receive interest on your loan. I think BlockFi is the most well known, but I wouldn't recommend doing this until bitcoin has matured a bit more and websites like these have built more reputation and are under more regulation. I heard Gemini announced they will be opening interest earning accounts soon, and they have one of the best reputations in the industry. I'm sure we will be seeing much more services like this from even bigger and more reputable companies in the next few years.
And you can most definitely earn it. There are many e-lance websites that pay in bitcoin. There are some companies that have options to receive salary in bitcoin. Not to mention, you can earn directly from the protocol itself by contributing computing power to secure the network as a miner. In fact, almost my entire personal accumulation of bitcoin has been earned as payment for doing freelance graphic design work from a local client of mine who asked me if I would accept bitcoin as payment. I've been working with this client from 2013-present. Really really glad I said yes to his offer, haha.
Edit: Btw, I said bitcoin is _money_ not _currency_. Although, I would argue that it is both. And it is hard money, at that. Which is more than you can say about any government issued currency. During periods of high volatility, bitcoin can become a bit awkward as a currency, I'll admit. But, this volatility should theoretically smooth out as the market cap grows.

Another counter argument to that claim is that the network itself has value and bitcoins are the intrinsic currencies of the network. This article is probably the most well put together argument for that case: 
Another good one by a user whose comment is way at the bottom for whatever reason:
Peter Schiff: "bitcoin is not a store of value because theres no value to store"
Answer: utility + scarcity = value, this is true of all economically valuable things on earth. Bitcoin's blockchain (and its PoW security) is potentially the most useful piece of open source software ever invented, and bitcoin the asset (the token required to write to the blockchain) is more scarce than gold.

If fully adopted, it stops corruption in money issuance and the power to create money from nothing to fuel corrupt imposition of will.

You would now have to give up a very hard asset, which makes it that much harder to do. Obviously it won't overcome all corruption, but it would make certain financial based corruption much more difficult. At least that's how I see it. The downside is, it also makes legitimate funding and loaning much harder as well. As with almost any new tool, the sword is often double edged. But, I honestly don't see a world without any fiat currency arriving anytime soon. But I certainly could see a world where fiat currencies lose a substantial percentage of their value, and quickly, in comparison to bitcoin and other harder monies.

Is that a brick and mortar bitcoin and altcoin exchange? Would be really curious about how this operates. When one buy coins there do they send them directly to a private wallet? Or do they have some sort of custodial thing going on also?

But the USD is *of* the US government.
The internet is a decentralized open source mass communication tool for the masses created by the masses. Bitcoin is the same, it resides on nodes that are all synced through the internet, and it was created in an open source collaboration coordinated via the internet. Contributions can be made by any contributing internet user as long as their contribution is accepted by the consensus of other bitcoin users.
The USD was not created on the internet, through the internet, by internet users. So it is not *of* the internet. It is *of* the US government, or more accurately, it is *of* the Federal Reserve Bank and enforced by the US government.

The problem isn’t necessarily with BCH directly (although there are plenty of problems with it too), the problem is the fact that people wanting to buy BTC could easily accidentally buy BCH thinking they are buying BTC. The fact that they put BCH first and BTC second is misleading at best.

Following historical patterns it will bounce around between 7k and 15k, mostly sticking around the 10k region, for the next year or two. And then after that year or two we'll see the next hype cycle, probably driven largely by lightning having been fleshed out, the block reward having been halved, mainstream financial institutions having well established crypto related products, and mainstream commercial adoption in sight (ie. bitcoin payment options beginning to roll out at point of sale in some major retailers), if not actively under development.

Honestly, if you’re only investing $300, I would just download the Coinbase app, buy it in there and leave it in there. I know people say “not your keys, not your bitcoin” and I’ll probably get shit for making such a suggestion on this sub, but at such low stakes, it’s really not worth the headache of  selecting non-custodial wallets to send them to, safely keeping seed phrases, worrying about getting hacked, and all the headache involved with “being your own bank”. If at some point you decide to invest larger amounts, or better yet, we hit another hype cycle and your $300 investment grows to something much larger, then it will be worth it to consider purchasing a hardware wallet to withdrawal them to and learning about safely storing your seed phrase.

I imagine that most people who got in that early, accumulated a non-trivial amount, and were true believers, either flat out held, cashing out forks as if they were dividends and either pocketing the profits or reinvesting. Or, if they have the stomach for it, maybe tried selling off smaller fractions of their holdings at moments that seem like peaks of bubbles hoping to refill their position at a lower price and skim a little profit that way.
Speaking for myself, I fall into the first category. But certainly will be and have been tempted to try catching tops and bottoms with small portions of total investment.
True believers in the value and dominance of BTC don’t just cash everything out at once. That’s for the get rich quick kids, that never really get that rich, but maybe get enough for a few nice vacations.

@_date: 2019-06-03 06:22:23
Only a very small percentage of the bitcoin in existence are actually getting traded at any given moment. And as price starts to climb this percentage gets smaller and smaller since people don’t want to let go of a rising asset. This is what causes the large boom and bust hype cycles bitcoin goes through. It wouldn’t necessarily take a collapsing dollar to cause a spike to 1 million, it would just take huge institutional entry along with a another big influx of retail investors, and maybe a sprinkle of mainstream adoption, which is seeming like an increasingly likely scenario.

It may be priced in as people anticipate the impending supply constraint. But that doesn’t change the fact that as people try to buy more bitcoin in the future, after the supply flow has dropped, there will be less inflow of stock for them to purchase from, forcing buyers to purchase higher and higher priced sells.

Took an L in 2017? The price of bitcoin was under 1k before 2017, and over 19k by the end of it, that’s a huge win.

What percentage of your acquisitions have been sold/spent?
What purpose do you use bitcoin for?
Do you run a node?
Do you hold your bitcoin on an exchange or custodial wallet, private wallet on PC, private wallet on mobile device, private wallet on thumb drive, hardware wallet, or paper wallet?

I personally do still diversify. Just, now instead of BTC being like less than 5% of my portfolio, it is like 20% because it’s just by far the best performer. And now that I understand the tech really well, it actually seems like probably the smartest thing you could have in your portfolio, at almost any percentage (as long as it wouldn’t significantly change your life if you lost it all in the, at this point fairly slim imo, chance that it looses all its value suddenly and never recovers). And I know that as more and more people realize this, it will continually just become an even better thing to have in your portfolio over the course of time, because demand will grow insatiably while supply flow is programmatically guaranteed to decrease every few years.

Halvings don't happen faster because of price increase. Price increase could drive hash power for sure, but then the difficulty level will adjust and we'll still be discovering new blocks every ~10mins, not matter the how high the price or hash power increase.
@_date: 2019-06-03 06:46:56
Yes, definitely, when looking at long term logarithmic charts it seems obvious that the halvings are the catalyst that starts the whole cycle. But even the miners are subject to the scenario I described. Newly minted coins don’t just go straight into an exchange. As the price increases miners start to hoard their rewards also, knowing that they will likely be worth a great deal more in the nearish future, further constraining supply from Newly minted coins beyond just the constraints caused by the halving. And they are also subject to the big dump when the telltale signs of the bubble pop turn up, knowing that now their mining rewards will likely be worth less in the nearish future.
What you’re describing is basically what determines the stock to flow ratio of all existing bitcoin. Which is a bit more steady and linear with big jumps at the Halvings, but never a reversal. So, yes, it likely catalyzes the bubble, but has no direct contribution to the parabolic rise or the pop, which completes the bubble formation. And also only has a tangential effect on the availability of bitcoins on exchanges, since the miners have to decide for themselves when they want to divest their acquisitions just like any other investor. Still ultimately comes down to market psychology and supply/demand.
Took me a minute to find, but here’s the stock to flow chart overlaid with bitcoin price. You can see the stock to flow is mostly linear and just shifts upwards at the halvings. No parabolic growths or pops. It is interesting though how if the spikes in the price chart were smoothed out, and the shifts in the stock to flow chart were smoothed out, they would basically be the same. So it certainly seems obvious that stock to flow has a direct effect on the long term price movement:

Bitcoin exists as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Not even the creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, ever claimed to have created bitcoin with some kind of libertarian agenda in mind.

Do you consider all businesses greedy and immoral then? I mean, look at it from the business perspective. They want to make bitcoin wallets for people, but they know the demographic is small. It wouldn't be worth the risk having an industrial manufacturer make the wallets for them in bulk (1000+), and therefore a much better price per unit (but also much larger initial investment). If not enough people want them, they just lost a ton of money on impossible to sell inventory. But, they find someone who makes custom design leather wallets as one-offs, so now they can eliminate the risk of loosing any kind of monetary investment on their venture. Downside is, now they have to charge a lot more to make the same profit, since they're not getting bulk prices. This higher price point now further limits their demographic. They really aren't expecting to sell a ton, maybe just a handful. So to make it worth it, they decide 100% is a good margin. And, honestly, I'd agree and probably choose a similar price if I felt like doing such a thing.
Edit: I guarantee you paid for a much higher margin on all the clothes you wear, unless you manufacture your own clothing.

I see. I guess you're right, it was probably just a misfortunate coincidence. Bitcoin became pretty of flooded by libertarians (the political party) in the earlier days, and I don't necessarily mind all libertarians, it just got a bit annoying having their ideals shoved down your throat constantly on the forums. So when I thought the commenter was trying to say that BTC was a technology created to support the libertarian party it struck a nerve with me.

My guess is in +/-2 years. Large institutions with big reputations to keep will want to spend a lot of time to test their various means of trading and holding BTC safely without fear of hacks/theft, making sure everything is airtight. They probably already started the R&amp;D a year or two ago, and likely are in testing and tweaking phases now, with some already having offered some limited versions of their solutions to some of their clients.

Kilosats is good. Coming up with shorthand names for orders of magnitude of sats is way more analogous to what people are already comfortable doing with conventional currencies. So it definitely makes a lot more sense. Maybe Hectosats for 100? That would be the same thing as a "bit" denomination-wise.
Edit: I have this vague recollection of reading a post at least a year ago, maybe more, of someone possibly suggesting something like this before. But could just be a fake memory. I dunno, human biological memory kinda sucks, huh.

100k minimum, I’d say. If the ATH of 20k, having dropped to 4K, now rises back to a peak of 120k before popping, then it would almost form identical movements (but bumped up two order’s of magnitude) to in 2013 when BTC’s once ATH of $210 dropped to $65 and then peaked at $1,200.

Ok, yea that's perfectly valid. I guess we can only hope that this particular sector of the animal gambling industry remains ethical. Like, for example, horse racing in other countries (eg. France) where the animals are treated very well and health of the animal is valued over performance.
I'm just saying, we can't take all the terrible things certain sectors of this industry do, and apply them to innocent actors trying to make it in that same industry. If anything, they could use the money they make humanely racing these mice to spend on awareness campaigns about other more unethical actors in their industry. Coming into an industry that is known for unethical behavior with a new ethical paradigm is exactly how you start paradigm shifts within an industry in the first place.

Libra and bitcoin are completely different. I can tell by the things you say you have a lot to learn. Libra is a stable coin for one. And they won’t generate out of thin air. Every time someone “turns” a dollar/yen/euro etc... into a Libra coin that gov’t currency gets put into a fund, and that fund essentially backs the Libra coin. So it’s basically backed by a basket of national currencies. It’s really not much different than traditional banking but with blockchain and cryptography injected into it. It’s a smart idea as a kind of internationally backed stable coin, but ultimately is kind of like powering a car by pulling it with a horse. It’s not permissionless, you will have to apply to run a node or mine it, and the prerequisites are hefty to say the least. This also means it won’t really be decentralized. It’s scarcity can be diluted by governments printing more of their currencies. It’s not censorship resistant, if Facebook (or whatever consortium of companies involved with Libra) wants they can lock you out of your account. And the database probably won’t be secured with even a fraction as much hash power securing Bitcoin’s Database.
Bitcoin isn’t a company, so trying to compare it to stocks in that way is a fool’s errand. It’s a public utility, and that is where its value lies. In that public network itself. It is a currency and a hard money tied and wrapped up into a payment processor that is completely open, borderless, permissionless (no need to apply for an account and be granted permission to use), decentralized and censorship resistant (ie. nobody can be stopped from using it, your bitcoin wallet can’t ever be shut down by any central authority). And it all runs on the world’s most secure and immutable database. Oh, and just to top it all off, there can never (baring very unlikely consensus) be more than 21 million ever produced, and it’s impossible to counterfeit, so it’s scarcity can never be diluted. If one can’t see fundamental inherent value in that, then they’re either blind or dim, I’m sorry. I’m gonna give you benefit of the doubt and say you probably fall more into the blind category. Anyone who really does diligent research will see that Bitcoin’s valuation right now is still extremely low, and we’re still only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to potential use cases. Like many say, bitcoin is still in the early 90s if compared to the internet’s evolution and growth.

A lot of things are easily exchangeable to currencies that you would never try to call a medium of exchange. I can easily exchange my Apple and Google stocks to any currency, but my stocks are most definitely not a medium of exchange. And “being in demand” absolutely does not make something a medium of exchange, either. Popeye’s fried chicken sandwiches are in demand, but not a medium of exchange. New tracks from Cardi B are in demand, also not a medium of exchange. Look up the definition of medium of exchange and it will explicitly say “it is widely accepted as payment for a good or service“ The key here is WIDELY accepted. A medium of exchange needs to be a medium that a wide majority of the people you want to transact with are going to accept the in the exchange.

Libertarianism is a political philosophy, not a synonym of "freedom" or "liberty", even if those may be the values that the philosophy holds highest. So if you're talking about "Libertarian" you are talking about a political movement. Saying "I'm talking about Libertarian as in Freedom" is like saying "I'm talking about communism as in community". You're just trying to retrograde the meaning of the word back to its etymological root, disregarding all the meaning that was added to it when the word was coined.
Anyways, your reply doesn't address what I'm trying to say: "Libertarians adopted Bitcoin as something that fit into their agenda, not the other way around." I understand that Satoshi stepped away as a public figurehead of his creation many years ago, but we are talking about what Bitcoin was created to promote. And the only thing we can look towards to get a hint of what Bitcoin was created for is the white paper and any record of Satoshi's communications during early development. None of which show any affiliation with a political party or show that there was any political motive or agenda behind it.
Some of Bitcoins earliest contributors were known libertarians (Hal Finney included). And the tech certainly is attractive to libertarians' beliefs surrounding hard money. But again, Bitcoin wasn't created to promote anything other than the freedom to transmit value, by anyone, using a secure, decentralized, censorship resistant, and pseudonymous protocol. Nowhere in the white paper does it talk about promoting any political party's vision. But any political party is welcome to promote it. Something that many libertarians have opted to do. But let's keep the record straight and recognize that: "Libertarians adopted Bitcoin as something that fit into their agenda, not the other way around."

Ok, this is not how lending bitcoins work. It’s just like putting dollars in a savings account and getting interest on it. When you go to withdrawal from the account you still get the same amount of dollars you put in (plus whatever interest) regardless of how the value of the dollar fluctuated against other currencies. So if I put 1 bitcoin in an interest bearing account, when I go to take that 1 bitcoin out it’s still 1 bitcoin (plus interest) regardless of how much the dollar value of BTC has changed.

Because more and people will want it as they realize that it’s the world’s hardest money ever created. And fewer and fewer people will want to exchange their bitcoin, once they get it, back to the far inferior gov’t currencies. And not just that, but it also has all the features I mentioned previously which make it straight up the most advanced and powerful money and unit of account ever conceived. After the halving, coming up in less than a year, the supply flow will be cut in half, for the third time. These circumstances will naturally drive the price up. So it’s not so much that it “has to necessarily involve its market cap reaching into multiple trillions”, so much as it will be an inevitable reaction to market conditions. Gold has a market cap of several trillion, and it isn’t even as hard a money as bitcoin, and lacks all of its technological features. After this upcoming halving, gold’s supply flow will be even greater than bitcoin’s. Bitcoin could very likely one day have a market cap equal to gold’s, and possibly much higher, all depends how the tech evolves and what people decide they want to do with it. Right now, the sky is the limit in that regard.

1. There will always be rich people and poor people, bitcoin's goal has never been stated to change this. A lot of the people who bought bitcoin early were once poor people, btw. And if you think its only selling point is that it's "not corporate controlled" then you have a lot more reading to do my friend.
2. This is a possibility, but it won't happen over night. Bitcoin's price increase didn't happen overnight either, it was very gradual with a few big booms, each one immediately followed by a slightly smaller bust. And there is still lots of room for bitcoin to grow. It will likely be in the 6-figures per bitcoin within the next 2 years. And because it is deflationary, the value will only continue upwards. This is good for everyone, rich or poor.

Lol, this is not what’s going on at all. More like, nobody is paying any attention right now.

This. How the hell am I supposed to remember what a bit is or a millibit and what fraction of a bitcoin they are. Way too unintuitive to how we are used to dealing with numbers. It's a lot easier to wrap ones head around 100 sats, or 100,000 sats. Maybe someday, when bitcoin is far more ubiquitous, we will have nicknames for certain orders of magnitudes of sats. Similar to how we call $100 a benjamin or benny, or $1,000 dollars a rack, or $10,000 a stack, etc... But this comes after everyone is already familiarized with numerically represented units.

Bubbles happen in bitcoin because such a small percentage of all the bitcoin in existence are actually available on exchanges at any given time. As price starts to rise, this percentage gets smaller because people don’t want to sell a rising asset. In addition, as the price rises more people also want to buy it and get in on the action. It creates a classic supply/demand scenario where the supply gets smaller as the demand increases. At a certain point the price gets so high people who acquired the asset early in the bubble phase have made such large gains they start to dump large supplies onto the market to realize those gains. This creates more than enough supply for the people buying in causing the price to steady and even reverse a bit. Now fewer people want to buy because they are scared to invest in a depreciating asset. The supply is now increasing (from people realizing gains) while the demand decreases (people scared to invest because signs of bubble popping). After a certain point, people who got in late get scared they are going to lose money on their investment so they try to get out before it drops below where they bought in, further increasing supply and further lowering demand. It’s really pretty simple, but would still be a worthy study of classic supply/demand economics for a high school level research project. And definitely has room to delve a little deeper into market psychology and all the other topics mentioned by u/TenshiS

Higher taxes to cover slavery reparations sounds fair to me. If generations upon generations of my forefathers were imprisoned and exploited via labor theft for hundreds of years, and then the progeny of those exploiters, now in possession of all the capital accumulated through said exploitation, one day realized "You know, all that imprisonment and theft was unfair, we won't do it anymore, but we're also not gonna do anything about it to make you whole" I know I'd sure as hell be up in arms too.
Health insurance for your own family plus all the unemployed? Sounds good to me. I dunno about you, but I'd rather not share my country with a bunch of sickly/diseased people.
Businesses relocating some of their operations to cheaper areas of the world is caused by particular global economic conditions, not necessarily the policies of a specific party of any specific country. What success has Trump's economic policy changes had on bringing work that went overseas back to the country? From what I've seen, it has been extremely limited. Jobs will always change and fluctuate. If you look at newspapers from the 19th century you will find all kinds of articles about how industrial machines will take away all the countries jobs, but the unemployment rate has rarely every fluctuated more than a few percentage points. Jobs don't just up and disappear, they just change, and people, being the incredibly adaptable species we are, can pivot and find our place within the demands of an ever changing occupational landscape. If the Chinese want to swallow up a large percentage of our manufacturing jobs, great, those jobs are shitty and take a massive toll on their surrounding environment and are often incredibly hazardous for the workers anyways. Why do we want to corner that market when there are much better and cushier jobs out there ready for the making and taking. Just because the manufacturing industry was good for 20th century America, doesn't mean it is necessary for us to employ people now. I don't know many kids getting out of high school today that are hype on securing that job down at the plunger factory.

I’m in the same boat as u/bittabet. Although of a friend if mine owes me money for something I paid in fiat for for them, I happily accept repayment in BTC, and add it to my holdings. So in that sense I still invest here and there.
But I can assure you that people are definitely furiously buying it up, as evidenced by the 300% increase in price we’ve seen this year. And once bakkt and fidelity have their bitcoin platforms, many many people who were once too intimidated by all the bitcoin exchanges, which at most have only been around a few years, can now invest in it through institutions that have been around for decades. Institutions that are already custodians of their other current investments. Last hype cycle was not for the risk averse. This upcoming hype cycle will be for the ultra wealthy risk averse who want a small 1-5% investment in bitcoin as both a hedge against global finance and an asymmetric investment. This will likely bring 100s of billions, if not trillions, of dollars into the BTC market cap. Only time will tell, but the writing seems to be on the wall if you know where to look.

Depends on the volume you’re purchasing. But for smaller amounts Binance and Coinbase pro have the lowest fees. Binance takes 0.1% and Coinbase Pro takes 0.15% (has to be a limit order though I think) but Coinbase Pro also offers free withdrawals. So depending on how clogged up the mempool is Coinbase Pro might actually be the cheaper option.

I never suggested that payments need to be made directly by court order to specific individuals, or anything like that. I guess I'm using the word reparations loosely and more in regards to socially funded programs designed to enrich vulnerable or otherwise disenfranchised minorities with US birthright citizenship, to start. I know there are already things like this, but they could be more well funded, and those who work for these programs could be paid better in order to attract higher quality employment.


My forefathers were wealthy real estate tycoons and media moguls. And they were caucasian Americans and Europeans. So no, not my forefathers. The progeny of those who were imprisoned and whose forced labor allowed my forefathers all the free time and extra capital to build the empires that I, and many other white Americans, benefit from today. It's not a coincidence that the Forbes 400 richest Americans list doesn't have a single black person on it.


No, most families have male and female parents. So capital doesn't get accumulated and stuck within the hands of a specific gender. But most families are monoracial, on the otherhand, so capital does accumulate and get stuck within the hands of certain races, especially when a specific race is exploited heavily for an extended period of time.


What you apparently don't realize, though, is that just because we didn't do it, doesn't mean that those injustices haven't echoed through time and led to massive wealth disparities today. We still have a responsibility, in my opinion, to at least attempt to right any lingering wrongs from our societal past.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:59:57
You're right, there are 2 black Americans on the list that I missed. But still, c'mon, 2 of 400, that's less than 1% in a country where ~15% of the population is black. That's still a huge disparity. Whether or not redistributing stolen capital is a "wrong" or not is still up to debate in regards to the nuances of this particular issue.

I'm a huge fan of Gemini as a company, except for their fee structure. It's just not competitive at all. At the volume of trading I do (under $25k a month) I'd be paying 1% with Gemini vs 0.15% with Coinbase Pro. They do cover miner fee on withdrawals for up to 10 transfers a month, which is nice. Not as good as Coinbase Pro's unlimited free withdrawals, but I don't think I've ever made more than 10 transfers in a month anyways. Too bad they can't get their trading fees on a competitive level or I would definitely switch to them in a heartbeat. Big fan of the Winklevi.

Word. Well lemme try to further desensitize you a bit then. Once I took a tab of LSD, 1.7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, a dose of MDMA, smoked a bunch of weed, and drank a few beers all within the span of a couple hours. Had a pretty fun night. Would not suggest it for the faint of heart though. I did LSD and shrooms and MDMA individually many times prior, and mixed LSD with MDMA a few times before as well, so I had a lot of experience with these particular drugs already. First time I did psychedelics I was 16 years old. I've tried almost all mainstream drugs at least once, and a couple research chemicals as well. When they teach you that drugs are bad in school, its all bullshit propaganda in my opinion. Drugs aren't bad, what is bad is having a lack of willpower. I've done some of the most addictive drugs in the world. Crack, cocaine, meth, opiates, benzos, etc... and never developed any addictions/dependencies because I know that habitual use of hard drugs can ruin just about every aspect of your life. As long as you know this and have the willpower to not do any single type of drug more than once a month or so, and really commit to that restraint, you'll be fine. This is really what should be taught in schools, in my opinion, because abstinence is a hard thing to convince to a person and drugs aren't necessarily bad inherently. The frequency of use is the real danger. But when you are taught that drugs are just inherently bad and to never ever touch them, and then you eventually inevitably do try them, you're like "Hey, I expected this to be so much worse then it is, I guess they just lied to me [which is kind of true]. So, I guess since everything they told me was a lie, I can just do these drugs as much as I want cause they don't really seem all that dangerous actually." But if they taught kids that the real danger is in frequency of use and that addiction doesn't take grip until you start using a drug habitually, then when they inevitably try a drug for the first time I think the thought would be more along the lines of "Well this is decent I guess, kinda fun, but not really worth a drug addiction and ruining my life over, so I don't think I'll do it again for a while." And then, maybe, we'd have a lot less addicts in the world. Or maybe not, I dunno. Either way, teaching abstinence has always proven to be a failure.

I think if I saw someone with a bitcoin leather wallet I would assume a higher likelihood that they have almost no cash in it and a debit card with a near zero balance, given the crypto demographic. The possibility that they have a large holding on a hardware wallet or something similar at home is there (although still not guaranteed). But how is that gonna help me, as a stick up kid, looking to strip someone of as much value they have on them as possible within a minute or two on the sidewalk? I would much more likely want to target someone with a Gucci, Luis Vuitton, or Chanel wallet/purse. A relatively cheap looking wallet with a nerdy crypto logo on it is not that luring, lol.

I'm just an extremely satisfied customer. Used Coinbase a lot 2013-2015 and then Coinbase Pro (previously DGAX) since 2016. I've always been a huge advocate. Early on because of how easy they were to use, that they were an American company, and seemed reliable. Nowadays mostly because I love that they have no fees on limit orders, and free withdrawals, making it a feeless medium to acquire crypto through. They have a great security record, so I feel safe leaving small holdings on there. They could brush up a bit on their customer service. And I agree they aren't squeeky clean when it comes to business ethics and public relations. But most of what you mentioned is exaggerated political BS and fear mongering. Name me one modern bank that allows for user anonymity and doesn't attempt to identify criminal activity?

Wouldn't this technically be at the very least the 4th Wave? There was the first wave from $0.05-$1 and then from $1-$30 (these two could maybe be considered one double-crested wave), then one from $10-$200 and then $100-$1200 (these two could also maybe be considered one double-crested wave), and then the last one that went from $1000-$20000. So this next one would at the very least be the 4th wave, and maybe be even be considered the 5th or 6th.

Coinbase has been an enormous boon to the American crypto market. They have been one of the most reliable crypto marketplaces, been around since 2012 without any major incident. If it weren't for Coinbase I probably would have never acquired any bitcoin, and especially not as early as I did. They have great security, reasonable fees, and they are incredibly beginner friendly. All of which are in the interest of its users. Saying they act against the interest of their users every chance they get is hyperbole at best, if not just downright false. They act in their own interest as a company, of course, as all companies do. And keeping their users happy benefits them as a company, so acting against them would make no strategic sense whatsoever.

Coinbase Pro has some of the lowest fees out there, and zero fees if you use it right. Limit orders have no fee, and they grant free withdrawals. I heard they are changing this soon though. I think they are going to start charging like .3% on limit orders or something, which is still insanely low.

This is all just drama as far as I'm concerned.
They didn't really support 2x in any actual material way, in fact 2x never even really happened, it was DOA.
BCH was for a moment the second largest crypto by market cap, and has consistently been in the top 5, so it made sense for them to list it, they were already listing LTC and ETH.
They are basically a bank, how are they supposed to avoid the IRS? All banks report to the IRS.
The motive for hiring Neutrino seemed to be to identify criminal activity on the blockchain, not to simply deanonymize all its users. And they fired every member of Neutrino that was involved with Hacking Team after acquiring the company. Remember, Coinbase is basically a bank. They can't have anything to do with anything criminal. This is a "cover our ass" situation.
Coinbase implemented Segwit less than a year after its initial implementation on the blockchain, that is far from a "refusal". And I'm sure they will implement lightning once it is more stable, lightning is far from ready for mass or even institutional use.

That may be the case, and probably is. Kraken definitely has a good reputation all around, and has an equally pristine security record as Coinbase.

So I'm still more financially incentivized to use Coinbase Pro, unfortunately.

It has always been an age where there are three genders. Look up what ovotesticular DSD is and tell me what gender should be “assigned” to an individual with it. Hint: If looking at their sex organs for definition then you will be left scratching your head trying to fit them into one of the two genders.
For whatever evolutionary reasons a sexually binary biology seems to have dominated the mammalian class. But it would certainly be extremely closed minded of us to assume that a sexually binary system is the only one with any legitimacy. Not to mention that gender roles are a purely societal construct, which tend to sway with the winds of time. So it too would be closed minded, if not straight up ignorant, of us to assume that the current concepts of gender binary norms should stay the same forever.

The days/weeks/months prior to the previous bull run felt just like any other bear market day/week/month. And then it just kinda came seemingly out of nowhere. Personally I almost completely stopped paying attention to bitcoin, maybe checking price once every couple months. And then one day I checked the price and it was approaching previous ATH and I was like “oh shit, something’s happening here” and as it approached 10k I was in near disbelief, knowing a huge correction must be eminent.
One thing I can say is that during that year or two where I stopped paying attention many other people were building all kinds of really interesting things based around bitcoin and alternate blockchains. It was all happening under my radar, and as the bull run was happening and I started paying attention again I was amazed at how much progress I had missed out on and wasn’t paying attention to. It was like missing a few seasons of your favorite show and being able to binge watch it for a few days.

No, it is more valuable than other crypto because its network/infrastructure is much larger.

Original commenter said "Nothing has value" not "Nothing has intrinsic value" He also goes on to talk about human emotion and the nature of desire. These are psychological and philosophical concepts. Also, doesn't gold having practical uses depends on what you find practical. If I don't find any value in any of the things gold has to offer me, then does it have any value to me? This is what I mean by value being subjective. And this is not really a tangent, all of this is very in line with the original comment.

Here’s an article I recommend reading if you want a more strictly economic angle on why Bitcoin (and therefore the currency that runs on its network) has “intrinsic value”

They’re talking about fees that are collected at various points in transacting money. If it is in your native currency and a credit card is used a fee is paid to the credit card company. If it is a foreign sale a fee is paid to the credit card company plus currency conversion fee. If you are wiring money abroad you pay large fees to western union plus currency conversion. Bitcoin is insanely low friction and all transactions distill down to a negligible fee less than a penny (when using lightning network) and maybe a few cents if on base layer.

Yes, interesting observation. Although Bitcoin is different from company share since it's actually an open source project. Although one could say that open source projects and a publicly traded company could have some similarities, except that with open source projects you don't necessarily need to hold "shares" in the project in order to contribute. Definitely uncharted territory from a financial perspective, which is what makes it so interesting.

Key word in my reply: "summarizes." The video merely serves as a quick and simple alternative to me finding and linking to the dozens of threads on r/bitcoin of people discussing block size and the problems they have with BCH. But here are a few to get you started since you insist:






@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:56
Yea, you're right to an extent for sure. But if you are investing any substantial amount where fees are of concern I would hope you are also doing a little bit of research to see what the best ways to do so are. And there are plenty of people out there explaining the feeless Gdax method. If you're just investing under a few hundred bucks then a fee of under a few percent shouldn't even really be much of a concern anyways. In that context just use whatever is easiest and don't worry about the penny pinching. Just my opinion.

Bulletproofs and other nascent tech should be deployed and tested in the wild on smaller platforms like Monero or Mimblewimble before super high-profile blockchains like bitcoin should add the feature. So that makes sense that it will be used in Monero much sooner. The newest tech always comes to Bitcoin last because security and reliability are of primary concern, as they should be for a network that holds so much wealth. Just like how the largest companies are almost always the most risk averse.
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:51:47
No other currency (other than cryptocurrency) is a payment processing system as well as a currency at the same time. In order to transfer value with other currencies electronically you need to use a payment processor as a third party to transfer the value for you. With cryptocurrencies the currency and the payment processing system are one in the same.
Also, money and currency are not the same.

Yea, I'm well aware. I even referenced the code he offered to increase block size in my response. Both his block limit implementation and the code he offered to incrementally increase block size were developments he made/offered in 2010 (source:  Do you realize how insanely early in Bitcoin's development that is? Why are people obsessing over a recommendation someone made about scaling in 2010? Later it was discovered that limiting block size served a second purpose, and that was decentralization. Larger blocks makes it harder for anyone to run a full node. Again, if it weren't Satoshi who made the comment it would be considered an unremarkable forum entry from 2010. And again, Satoshi never wanted to be considered some infallible pope-like figure. This was intended to be a decentralized community driven project focused around consensus, not the centralized ideas an individual. May the best idea win, regardless of who's idea it is.

There is a completely fee free way to do this. No fee to move any funds from Coinbase to gdax. And since you’ll be using gdax make sure to make your purchases using a limit buy, gdax charges no fees with limit orders. And then withdraw your coins directly from gdax to your hardware wallet, gdax covers the miner fee on withdrawals.
If you buy your coins directly from Coinbase (as opposed to a limit buy on gdax) you’ll pay fees. If you buy directly from a friend you’ll have to pay a small miner fee, but right now those are so low they’re basically free (like in the 10-50 cents range, total). Unless the coins you’re buying from your friend are coming from their gdax account, in which case the fee is covered obviously.

No, but it made western union more valuable as a company. And you’re making one large misrelation between typical currencies and bitcoin.

"We do not know how BTC will behave during a financial crash, hard to use as a hedge."
We may not know how Bitcoin will behave during a global financial crash. But we do know that Bitcoin can't be censored and is resistant to seizure. It is a way to store wealth in a way where your assets can never be frozen.
"I can see that, however, it would have to have stability for people to use that option."
Bitcoin is usually stable, there are times that this isn't the case, like the past year. It gets hyped and then crashes every once in a while, but in the periods between hype cycles it holds value just fine for the most part. And in most cases your savings will grow instead of diminish, which is more than you can say about mainstream banking methods, where you're pretty much guaranteed to lose 2% a year or at best break even. I've held my savings in bitcoin for about 4 years now, I'm definitely not complaining about its ability to hold value.
"That is not true. Once upon a time they thought that, hence many are moving to other coins."
Bitcoin is definitely still used in dark markets. Yea there are other coins that are better for privacy. But it isn't hard to make an unidentifiable BTC wallet, and it is still the gold standard for crypto. This isn't even close to Bitcoin's largest use case by any means, but bitcoin is definitely still the most widely accepted currency in dark markets. Monero and Zcash are just hyped technology, they aren't accepted by most merchants.
"I could see that however not enough of it as it is not cheap nor easy. You can do a bank wire."
Cheaper and easier than a bank wire. Fees are under a dollar these days, and you don't need to go to a Western Union location, you can do it from a cell phone.

@_date: 2017-10-12 16:05:33
It is actually extremely trackable. Anyone can see every transaction ever made with bitcoin on the blockchain. But the sender and recipient's identities are only represented by a wallet number. So unless you can figure out who owns the private key to those wallets, the identities of those involved with the transaction are unknown.
Yes, you can buy $50 worth of bitcoin and literally watch it gain in value.
If you want more explanation of bitcoin I would suggest doing your own research. It can get pretty deep depending how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. Start with some introduction videos on youtube, many people like Andreas Antonopoulos' videos. Also there is a documentary on Netflix I have heard good things about called "Banking on Bitcoin"

It doesn’t matter as long as you move your coins to a hardware wallet right after purchasing. Just don’t do any purchasing around and a bit after the fork. Gdax has free transfers to personal wallets too so that’s nice.

Valid point, I dunno what is up with the Friday upswing pattern then. It may still be related somehow. Also, I've heard there is a way you can set up reoccurring purchases through Coinbase. Like for example I could say that I want to buy $50 worth of bitcoin every week. Coinbase makes the purchase and then they automatically take that out of your bank account. People would probably set these up to happen on their paydays to avoid the risk of over drafting perhaps. Maybe it is connected to this in some way? Not sure how many other exchanges offer this feature though.

@_date: 2017-10-12 14:11:39
In addition to what others have already said, valuation metrics for Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are structured differently than for stocks since there is no underlying company that can be valued. So analysts have started using what they call an NVT ratio (Network Value to Transactions Ratio) to determine whether or not a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued, and also whether or not the cryptocurrency is approaching bubble territory or not. A cryptocurrency's inherent value is mostly tied to the size of its network and its liquidity. Its value is actually not necessarily in the underlying technology (blockchain etc...) since the technology is open source and has no copyright or patent protection.

Lol. It's ok! I was once in the same position as you. I first starting using Bitcoin in 2013, but wasn't aware of all the drama/infighting until more recently (past year or so). I dug as deep as I could and ultimately I found that all I can really do is look at the tech as objectively as possibly and decide for myself which propositions I think sound the most exciting and have the most to offer in the long term development of this super intriguing project. Eventually, if you spend enough time just looking at the raw facts you will also be able to decide for yourself what ideas and implementations you prefer. Just try to filter out the noise, and remember the ultimate goals of the project, look at the raw tech, and choose to support that which you think will best support those fundamental goals.

Yes, buying goods and services with bitcoin can get tricky for the reason you mentioned. There are third party escrow services you can use online for things like this. And these kinds of services are only getting more advanced as people research and test new ideas. At some point these kinds of escrow services could potentially be worked directly into the protocol. Etherium is an alternative to bitcoin that has some aspects of an escrow service built into its protocol. And as the "internet of things" advances this will just make it all function that much easier as well.
I still think it is too much of an assumption to say it will not go mainstream. We are too early to make such a prediction and the technology is still too fresh. People said the PC would never go mainstream, same with the internet, both of which are now in pretty much every 1st world household. I won't deny that bitcoin going mainstream would certainly be a very steep uphill battle (competing with banks and some of the most powerful people in the world), but one thing history has shown us is that if the people want it, they will have it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:04:10
The fee that people pay for transactions is a completely separate thing from the block reward (how new Bitcoins are distributed). Here is a quick read explaining how new coins are distributed: 
Right now the incentive for miners is both this block reward and the fees they collect from users making transactions. Two separate things. Once all the bitcoins have been mined, there will only be the incentive of collecting fees. But since the block reward halves every so often and as more and more miners are competing for them everyday this incentive is kind of weened off instead of just suddenly disappearing. For example in the early days of bitcoin 50 Bitcoins could be mined every 10 minutes, but today only 12.5 are mined every 10 minutes and there are many many more miners competing for them and that it gets distributed amongst.

@_date: 2018-02-21 22:24:37

@_date: 2017-10-27 21:12:26
It's also not true, it has intrinsic value as a payment system. The bitcoin cannot be separated from the payment system (the protocol) which is something we are not used to when thinking about currencies and units of exchange. Dollars are separate from their payment systems (paypal, visa, etc...). Bitcoin and the blockchain are inseparable. So its inherent value lies in the system itself. And the size of its network (as well as some aspects of the protocol) is the reason why its value is so much higher than other systems like it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 06:52:08


And I've said this many times: Sure, anyone can build a blockchain, but why would they not want the security and network reach of *the blockchain* everyone uses (i.e. bitcoin)? Like I've said before, anyone could go out and make a different internet network other than the world wide web, but why would anyone use it if everyone is already on the world wide web?
And I'd like an explanation of what purpose a privately controlled blockchain holds over a basic database? Again, and I've said this before also, a centralized blockchain is just an extremely inefficient database.


Good, you should be, as am I. But, first of all, the stock market is due for a crash, and this inverted yield curve is making these markets look like very unsolid ground to be on. BTC is seeming like it could be a nice hedge, gold has already historically proven to be a good hedge as well, you should be holding both of these too. Many of the worlds best investors tell people they should put 1-5% of their portfolio into BTC (less if risk averse, more if risk neutral). If you lose a portion of the 1-5% of your portfolio, no big deal, but if btc does take off as a sort of uncorrelated hedge, or a store of value like gold, it could potentially be the best, or at least one of the best, performing investments of your lifetime.
Second of all, this still doesn't answer my question. These companies don't exist in a digital world. They exist in the physical world. The digital world is a nascent one, and people will start living in it to far more of a degree than they already do. And on levels that I don't even think we can fully comprehend right now. You said "As for which asset will be worth the most? Hey if I knew that I’d be rich!!" Sure, nobody knows for sure, but I'm asking you to just speculate, I mean, that's what investing is all about, right? I mentioned VR and AR, but there have also been some pretty big developments regarding brain to computer interfaces, like what Neuralink is doing. Of course I'm sure these brain computer interfaces are decades away at minimum, but they are certainly coming. There will be transitional steps along the way, like AR/VR, but I do believe people will start to care less and less about the physical world, and more and more about the digital one. And they will want scarcity in this world, because for whatever natural reasons, people value and like scarcity. Bitcoin is the very very first digitally scarce thing ever created. If you don't think that this is the ground floor of something that will someday be enormous, then your scope just isn't wide enough. Again, I ask you to speculate with me, what uniquely digital asset do you think will have the most value in 10-20 years from now?

Yes, the supply is limited to 21 million coins total. The coins are given out at a set rate to miners who "compete" for them with computing power essentially. The rate at which they are given out slows down over time. Almost 17 million coins have been mined so far, and the 21 million limit is estimated to be reached by 2140. This supply and rate of production is an integral part of the Bitcoin protocol.

Lol, it's already crashed 4 times in the past.
Also, gold is one of the more stable stores of value today, but was just about as volatile in its first few years of free trading. We are in the nascent years of a global digital store of value, it is going to swing quite a lot as it slowly works its way into the mainstream.

Why would people get mad? Right now BTC provides many different services to its consumers depending what they want from it. For someone in a country experiencing hyper-inflation like Venezuela it serves as a means to side step their country's economic collapse. For someone in a 1st world country looking to create an investment portfolio it serves as a hedge against the global financial system. For someone who lives in a country with few banking options it provides a safe place to store wealth. For people who function in the black market it provides a means to transmit wealth easily and cheaply outside of the government's surveillance. For people that have emmigrated to another country for economic gain it allows a cheap and easy method for them to send the wealth they are accruing back to their families. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples. And this is just the beginning.

This still requires access to a bank that will accept you as a client.
Even in that scenario Bitcoin still fills a market that a centralized blockchain controlled by a bank wouldn't fulfill. I'm sure banks will find plenty of useful ways to implement blockchain technology into their infrastructure. But Bitcoin (or any decentralized blockchain) doesn't require banks. You become your own bank, and you control and hold your own capital and its movement. No bank can freeze your account, it is censorship resistant. And it is simply a far more elegant system when  compared to the banking system, which is incredibly convoluted and in many cases very corrupt.
Bitcoin still has a much larger network than any other cryptocurrency, and has yet to show any signs of weakening. And its scarcity has nothing to do with its "corner on the market." There are plenty of other metals out there, and new alloys are created all the time, that doesn't affect the scarcity or the value of gold.

Anytime a user makes a transaction they also have to pay a fee to the miner who "confirms" their transaction. This fee is paid in Bitcoin (obviously) and is usually very low (a few cents to a dollar's worth). Some wallets (the software used to send and receive coins) allow you to make the fee whatever you wish. If you make the fee higher it will give more incentive for the miner to process your transaction before someone else's, and a lower fee might mean it will take longer for your transaction to get confirmed. If there aren't a whole lot of transactions waiting to get confirmed you can get away with making an extremely low fee and still have a fairly quick confirmation. When the 21 million Bitcoin limit is reached the incentive for miners will be these fees.

The Trezor itself doesn't actually hold your bitcoins, it just holds the private keys to your Bitcoin wallet. You can get a public key to that wallet that can be used to make deposits which you can give out to anyone freely. The Trezor only needs to be plugged in if you are sending bitcoins from your wallet to another wallet since that will require confirmation of your private key, which is on the Trezor. Receiving bitcoins from someone else's wallet will not require your Trezor since that does not require any confirmation from you, just from the sender.

\&gt; Immutable is not a good thing. You can’t counter fraud.
If you are concerned about fraud, then maybe bitcoin isn't the tool you're looking for right now. However, people are building second layer escrow services that will likely solve many of those kinds of issues. Again, these are still experimental so we'll see how they develop. But yes, I think everyone will agree that bitcoin benefits the receiver more then the sender, which is a big reason why people don't spend it and it is treated more as a store of value than anything else. If you look at history currencies go through 4 stages: collectible -&gt; store of value -&gt; medium of exchange -&gt; unit of account. Generally it goes through these stages pretty slowly. I would say that bitcoin is, right now, somewhere in the collectible -&gt; store of value stage. And to dismiss the possibility that it could continue through the stages to become a medium of exchange or unit of account is extremely short sighted.
\&gt; Permissionless also not really useful in any sense either.
See, you are stuck in the narrow perspective of a person of privilege. You aren't considering the fact that only something like 8% of the world population lives in conditions where traditional banking is ready or easily available for them. Having the option to essentially bank yourself without having to ask a company for permission is actually a very useful thing for the majority of the world's population. As we start to build an internet connected world with satellite signals, as is going on right now, and as smartphones become cheaper and cheaper, the developing world will soon have access to the internet and, by proxy, bitcoin.
\&gt; Also people can’t just look into my bank account and see where my money came from or what I spent it in.
That's not true. Pretty much anyone who works for your bank can. They also report all your transactions to the IRS or whatever your country's equivalent is. And with a court order, any law enforcement agency can take a look as well. And sure, the base layer of bitcoin is completely transparent, but it is still pseudonymous, which means that if you know what you're doing you can make it very hard for anyone to "see where my money came from or what I spent it in" beyond the transactions they have made directly with you themselves. And even if you aren't savvy enough to create unidentifiable transactions there are many tools that can be used for mixing your transactions and obfuscating their sources even more. And there are plans, again, for second layer solutions to the privacy issue.

You need to do more research. It is evident that there are foundational aspects of the protocol that you are either unaware of or don't understand.
For one, you can't create new Bitcoins either. You can mine them but once all 21 million of them are out they are out. It is estimated that by 2140 all Bitcoins will be mined. This is one of the most important aspects of the protocol. This was one of several ways in which Bitcoin was modeled after precious metals. It is designed to be a kind of digital gold, hence why people often refer to it as such.
And secondly, you don't need a trusted broker for Bitcoin to have value at all. It is a "trustless" system, that is the whole reason why blockchain technology is so groundbreaking. Everyone has a copy of the ledger so no one needs to trust a single entity/organisation/third-party. There is no need to trust when you can just verify against the public ledger that you and everyone else has a copy of. This is the foundation of blockchain technology. Saying "Being your own bank is fine and dandy if everyone trusted you but that's simply not the case" sounds ridiculous when talking about blockchain technology. That's like saying in reference to the internet "Being your own library is fine and dandy if you had stacks and stacks of paper to print all the books on."
As far as Bitcoin's stability is concerned, gold was just about as unstable when it first entered the free market. You can see the volatility on daily return for both graphed out here: 
Bitcoin is still nascent, it will be volatile, but I bet over the next few years it will start to become just as stable as gold. It took 15 years for gold to stabilize, we are only in year 8 for Bitcoin.

Well, I think your suspicion carries about as much weight as people's fears over Y2K. A new public-key algorithm could be added to Bitcoin as a softfork. From the end-user perspective, this would appear as the creation of a new address type, and everyone would need to send their bitcoins to this new address type to achieve quantum security. I would assume anyone with a substantial bitcoin stash held privately would be paying attention and would be ready to move their coins when the new fork is ready. Not too difficult.


If it's a private chain then that means the nodes are not open for anyone to host. Which means the data in the blockchain can be altered if those hosting nodes collude to do so.


Why does this need a blockchain though? If you are already trusting the central source to keep accurate records, then that defeats the purpose of the blockchain. Again, a centralized blockchain is just a really inefficient database.


Not necessarily. Depends on the algorithm. A private chain just means that only those with permission can host a node. So it only takes 51% of those hosting the nodes to alter the data in the chain. Which I can guarantee would be far fewer people than 51% of people hosting BTC nodes.


Again, from my perspective you're the one saying the ridiculously dumb things. Here's an article all about public vs private chains:
Let me pull some quotes out for you: 
"[a private] blockchain can be manipulated since it is centralized. The 51% attack, mentioned earlier in the book, illustrates this exact issue. When someone owns the majority hashing power of a blockchain network, they can rewrite the data within it, and therefore the information is not immutable or secure."
"There is always a point of failure in a centralized system. If the company maintaining the blockchain loses power, the blockchain shuts down."
"Because most corporations are not fully apprised of what blockchain technology really is and where its value lies, IBM and other early blockchain promoters can profit from the misleading media hype by offering “innovative” blockchain solutions for businesses. IBM charges up to $120,000 per year for the hosting of their Hyperledger Fabric system, which only serves to complicate existing databases (which already work completely fine, by the way)."
"At Iryo, we consider databases and blockchains that are not opened to the public to be insecure. They can easily be altered by the business running them at their discretion, and they go against the ethos of the open and transparent cryptocurrency space. Designed to keep public out and introducing 'trusted' middlemen, private chains forget that trusted third parties are security holes."
I think you may be among the company of those that "are not fully apprised of what blockchain technology really is and where its value lies"


We are on our way into it, certainly, but were just seeing the tip of the iceberg. I have explained what the digital world is, it is the world we've created on silicon chips, sitting on servers in warehouses all around the world, currently accessed with our computers and an internet connection.


Litecoin and eos are worth something, first of all, but far less than bitcoin, and for the same reasons as any other asset: supply vs. demand


Well, silver oxidizes fairly quickly, gold doesn't. Either way, 90% of gold's value is from people hoarding it as a store of value, any economist would agree.


There was nothing that existed digitally that functioned like cash does until bitcoin was created. Bitcoin is the first purely digital creation that created a cash-like system that could be exchanged solely through the internet. So, in the "digital world" bitcoin is the cash, and everything else is the "chips". And the "casino" is distributed across over, at minimum, 10,000 individual and sovereign nodes, so the likelihood of it closing is ridiculously unlikely.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value is the protocol and network itself. Because it is a currency that is inseparable from and intertwined with a payment processor, that system and network is where it derives intrinsic value. This is a great article from FEE that goes more in depth on that topic: 
Your other critiques about its use as a speculative investment could be said about nasdaq, or the housing market, or gold/silver, or many other commodities that are used by many as financial instruments rather than their actual use value (eg. ownership/control of a company, living quarters, manufacturing or decorative). A lot of the criticisms I hear about bitcoin adoption have to do with its function as a day-to-day currency, but it is much more than that. It also functions as a settlement system, remittance network, payment processor, investment tool/vehicle, commodity, security, etc... all rolled into one. Bitcoin has seen a lot of success in some of those use cases, and a bit less in others. But its use has been growing, at least some, in all those categories. Bitcoin's intrinsic value can even be roughly calculated using network theory. Here's another great article from MIT Technology Review explaining that in more depth: 
Bitcoin's market cap is still very low in comparison to mainstream currencies, payment processors, and financial investment tools. Given that its value still has so much room to grow, many people are making speculative investments in the asset. This is no different than just about any other investment vehicle in existence. It just so happens bitcoin is a much more volatile, moves much faster over time, and is a riskier investment than most.

I don't think Satoshi intended every idea he ever proposed to be taken as the word of god. He never intended for his ideas or work to be put above anyone else's, he believed in the consensus of the community and everyone who cared to be involved. If the developer community concluded that one of his ideas did not benefit the development of Bitcoin, then I think he would support their collective decision. 
Just because Satoshi once quickly mentioned an idea for scaling using incremental increases in block size in the early days of bitcoin development as a comment in a forum thread, doesn't necessarily mean that it was supposed to be the end all be all solution. I think he would probably be mildly horrified by how obsessed people are with holding every word he ever wrote as some infallible doctrine. He believed in the collective input of a large community, not the centralized ideas of an individual, even if that individual was himself (which is likely part of why he dropped out of the community).

Thats not quite right. Intrinsic value is the value of an asset determined through fundamental analysis without reference to its market value. Which is why I mentioned the value of all the time some of the world's most talented programmers have sunk into BTC, because that is a fundamental analysis of value. Also, the size of the network, because we know that large networks have a lot of value. Bitcoin solves the byzantine fault, a problem that people have been trying to solve for literally hundreds of years, this also has immense value.


Only some trivially small percentage of gold's value can be attributed to its use in industry. And gold is used so often in high end jewelry because it has value, not the other way around. If one day the world decided that holding gold as a store of value was stupid and it's market value was based solely on its use in jewelry and industry it is estimated its value would be around $100/oz. which is like only 7% of its current market value. The reason gold's market value is so high is because it has a finite supply that cannot be increased at whim (with current science/technology), it has a long history as a store of value, and it does not degrade in storage. That's really the only reasons its market value is so high. Talking about "intrinsic value", gold's is far below it's market price, that's for sure. Its basically just a shiny rock with some nice properties for jewelry making and conducts electricity well. Bitcoin also has a very finite supply that can't ever be increased at whim. But it has many advantages over gold. It is much easier to store, much easier to transport and transact, and much harder to counterfeit. As a financial instrument, BTC is immensely powerful for those reasons, and for anyone that understands that, it cannot be denied. Anyways, BTC has its use cases, gold has its use cases, and USD has its use cases, and they can all coexist happily, none are mutually exclusive.
And you talk about bitcoin and blockchain like they are two different things, they are not. A bitcoin is a unit of account that exists on the blockchain, they are inseparable. I can tell that you really don't fully understand bitcoin, and I think this is the reason why you are undervaluing it so much. I hope after you dig a little deeper someday you may have that aha moment that so many other economists have had. Many of the world's most recognized macro-economists who originally were very skeptical of bitcoin are starting to realize how powerful it actually is after doing more research. Here is an interview with an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank that has even come around to understanding how valuable this protocol is: 
This is a someone from the federal reserve bank, talking about how powerful BTC is. Someone who issues the great USD that you talk up so much. It takes a holistic understanding of what bitcoin truly is, and then its intrinsic value will become as obvious to you as it is everyone else here. And understanding bitcoin holistically takes an understanding of it on a technical, financial, social, and political level. It can literally take years before it all clicks together, but if you keep paying attention and learning more, it eventually will.

Do they? I've never heard anyone talk about fees driving market demand before. In fact, when fees were highest is when BTC began crashing from ATH. I've been under the impression that investors mostly just want to see trade volume. Which can happen at any price point, no way to predict really. And it's the trade volume that drives the fees up, because the mempool gets overburdened. But the fees themselves no one really cares about, until they get too high because it makes trading slightly less profitable. And it makes smaller transactions become financially impossible, which hurts bitcoins fundamentals a bit, not that bitcoin fundamentals are ever what's driving the price.

1 - The second layer protocols are just options you can use if you so choose to. If you want the immutability that the base layer provides, then use that. If you want some sort of payment reversal protection, then use some sort of mediator or escrow layer. The point is that all of it is open, permissionless, and relatively cheap, and that's what makes it powerful.
2 - What I said was "If you are concerned about fraud, then maybe bitcoin isn't the tool you're looking for right now." Meaning: if you don't trust the person you are transacting with to carry out with their end of the deal, and fraud is a concern in the transaction you are about to make, then bitcoin base layer isn't what you should be using to make the exchange. I'm not really sure where you started getting off on whatever you're trying to say in  there.
3 - "a currency is only a currency when it’s backed by the state." History shows that this just is not true and is actually a very recent phenomena. And the fact that all significant modern currencies are state backed just shows again how powerful bitcoin is. That it can exist as a currency outside the control of the state.


Bitcoin is fine, the base layer doesn't have any "problems", it does what it has to do pretty much perfectly. But it is only a foundation, similar to how tcp/ip is fine and does just what it needs to do but is only a foundation for other protocols to operate on top of it. If bitcoin itself were tweaked to fit everything that everyone wanted out of it, then it would lose all the properties that make it so great, it would lose its security, it would lose its decentralization, it would lose its immutability, etc... Depending what it is you are trying to do with your bitcoin the second layer protocols may allow you to use it in ways that work better for your use case. The purpose of the layers isn't to "fix" bitcoin, the purpose is to expand its capabilities. Just like when people built layers on top of tcp/ip they weren't "fixing" the internet, they were just expanding the internet's capabilities.

Uh, what i said was "Just the mere implications of having an infinite redundancy of data would have, our understanding of the universe would be upended." in response to your original question "so infinite redundancy is your goal?" Not talking about 6bn. Infinite redundancy would be an incredible feat altering our understanding of the laws of nature.


If that's the box you want to put it in, sure. But it can also be seen as  digital real estate on the blockchain. And it can be used as a means to write immutable and permissionless data to the blockchain. Again, seeing bitcoin and the blockchain as simply a currency and payment network is like seeing the internet as just email and an inbox. It has potential to be used for so much more, especially when you start to consider second layer applications. But we shall see. It is still all in experimental phase. Like I said we are still early days. The equivalent of the late 80s for the internet, or the 40s for computing.

Correct me if I’m wrong, OP, but by the title I’m assuming this book is specifically about how bitcoin can be used as a tool in disenfranchised black communities in America. It is known that these communities suffer more from being unbanked or poorly banked than most others in America. There’s nothing racist about this, America is a majority white country where the wealth and power is overwhelmingly in the hands of white men. So, while making a book called “Bitcoin &amp; White America” could maybe be perceived as having racist implications, this book’s title does not. Here, read this article to shed some more light on the issue:

For sure, but updating BTC isn't really all that hard. It literally happens all the time.


Maybe, it entirely depends on who runs the nodes, but being privately controlled means a certain level centralization, and centralization, as everyone knows, is the largest security vulnerability and creates opportunities for collusion. This destroys any trust those of us on the outside could have in it being immutable or secure.


Again, with the personal attacks. Why? It just makes your argument look weaker when you resort to this kind of childish knee jerk emotional expulsion. Grow up.


The digital world isn't a fantasy or imaginary. If you believe so you are ignoring the last hundred years of technological progress.


You make your calls digitally in your app, yes, but the actual shares represent a physical company. Please explain to me what you don't understand here. I'm talking about something that exists only digitally. Its sole expression in the world is in 1s and 0s and the 1s and 0s aren't meant to represent anything else but themselves. When trading stocks electronically, the digital information only represents something else that exists physically, it is not much different than writing on paper, but just writing on silicon instead. What I'm talking about is a purely digital asset, where the 1s and 0s are the asset itself. What solely digital asset will hold the most value? Other examples of solely digital assets would be something like a digital graphic, video, audio, or in the realm of gaming there are in game items that could be considered digital assets, and obviously cryptocurrencies are also digital assets. Most of these things, unless tokenized in some way, are easily duplicable, and therefore have no scarcity. Sure, you can have a gov't enforce a license for use, but this doesn't mean much in a borderless environment like the internet.


I definitely agree with you, I don't think the gov't will just shrivel away entirely. But there are lots of gov't institutions that I don't think will survive the path we're on. Schools is one example that I think is the least safe on your list. The internet makes self educating far easier than it has ever been. Earlier childhood development/education will always need a physical school, for sure, but middle school and high school I could easily see being consumed by some sort of digital program that kids are educated through. Kids would probably learn better from a super well designed VR experience than some crappy public school teacher who has no motivation nor idea of how to get kids engaged.


Not really, though. Silver is actually more conductive than gold, and far cheaper. There are countless other metals that can be cast that are far cheaper than gold. Gold holds value for the exact same reason: "It just currently has more idiots who like it."
Let's look at the value of gold if it weren't used as a financial tool at all. Here are the thoughts from the perspective of a professional Product Manager:
If gold was only utilized in products?....lets start from the bottom and go up as a Product Manager might try to place market value
Those products would be
Special electrical contacts
Plating to improve surface appearance and resistance to oxidation
Perhaps some medical applications, colloidal gold and gold salts
Perhaps an alloying agent in some brazing filler metals for jewelry
Flatware for eating utensils, perhaps
Gee, when I look at this list , I see silver which is currently about 14 -15 USD/to but going further...
Gold has an edge in jewelry as it wont tarnish as easily ( or at all) compared to silver. Perhaps it would have better value than silver in this market
But silver has better electrical and thermal properties so use of gold would be secondary to silver  except in some unique plating applications to preserve surface integrity... but silver still wins demand here
The gold alloys used for brazing have significantly higher melting temperatures than the multitude of silver brazing alloys, so there would be no practical demand increase other than the current applications.
Flatware... the gold wont tarnish , stays bright, and would be good if alloyed considerably to make it harder and durable as pure gold would be just too soft..might bend the fork on that steak. But we already have stainless steel sets for under $100 at Walmart.. so no demand or value here
Looks a lot like silver with some less value except in jewelry...
But at this price, I can see the a lot of mining operations closing up, bringing the supply way down , so maybe all that African gold would dominate and the price might be fixed by one or two major suppliers.

If BTC becomes the world reserve currency (at which point it's value would become extremely stable) every currency in the world would be compared to it, rather than the USD. so it would be more like 1USD is .00013BTC and 1JPY is .0000012BTC.

This is just fear mongering. The issue of quantum computing has already been addressed. Anyways, the cryptography securing the blockchain is used for traditional banking as well, so if it gets cracked by quantum computing there will be much bigger global economic problems if there isn't a work around (which there will be, its called quantum resistant algorithms: 


You didn't answer my question as to what advantage a private blockchain has over a standard database. There is no advantage to a private blockchain over traditional banking or other databases. Public blockchains have the advantages of being permissionless, immutable, borderless, and secure. Even nation states are realizing these benefits and the uselessness of private chain currencies: 


But you didn't. Equities in physical companies don't exist in the digital world. That's still a physical thing. I'm talking about things you can own that exist digitally only. What uniquely digital property will hold the most value?


Does saying things like this make you feel good? To me it just makes you look weak. Just because we think differently doesn't make either of us idiots. From my perspective you are the "fucking idiot" with an insanely myopic perspective. But no need for name calling when having a civil discussion. Personal attacks have no place in a debate of ideas.


This has already been disproven. Besides, all markets are manipulated, that's the nature of the market and free trade. Just depends how many hands are on the strings. The more hands on the strings the harder it is for any one source to manipulate them.


You don't know that. As the internet shrinks our world, connects us globally, and provides us with more and more tools of self organizing, the role of the state and government will slowly start to shrink.


The state you live in is meaningless in a borderless digital world.

Use a trusted exchange to purchase the bitcoin and then just withdraw them to the hardware wallet's receive address.

The article states that "Companies are anxious to get good news out, while bad news has to be dragged from them." And that this mechanic could be part of what creates bubbles. All the good news hyped by the company creates a steep trend line and then when bad news finally gets dragged out it causes a reversal.
Maybe Bitcoin could be in an inverse bubble because since it is not really a company there is no marketing or PR department for Bitcoin pumping hype from the moment it was launched. Any hype that forms around Bitcoin is created simply by its users. Because fear is such a powerful human trait when approaching something new without the bias of a marketing campaign perhaps all the "bad news" is actually what we are all anxious to get out and the "good news" slowly gets dragged out as we use and develop the technology and get comfortable with it. Most people who encounter Bitcoin for the first time are skeptical of it, but only after diving deeper into the technology and maybe actually using it do they realize how amazing it is and what kind of potential it holds. This creates a downward pressure on the asset that it must break through before it can attain its actual value. The opposite of a typical bubble where the asset has a lot of upward pressure from positive media and marketing hype and when that positive press subsides, or worse, turns sour, the bubble pops and the asset sinks to its actual value. I don't want to speak for the OP, but this is how I interpreted their comment.

How does saying there are second layer solutions admitting bitcoin is currently no good for use as a commodity or currency? It is the solution to those problems. What you're complaining about has to do with the interaction with the base layer (inefficiency, speed, cost), and I'm saying that there are solutions to that problem currently in development, some of which are actually already in a usable state, but I would still put them mostly in the "beta testing" stage at the moment. In the early days of the internet and tcp/ip it could take up to a minute just to load a gif or jpg. It was slow, inefficient, and expensive too. Then people built all kinds of layers on top of tcp/ip and now we have solutions to that issue and we can stream 4k video. Does that mean that there is something wrong with tcp/ip? Not really, it serves its purpose for what it is. You have to think of bitcoin as an ongoing, evolving technology. Not a final product. Just like the internet.


Again, what? I literally named the solution, and so far second layer solutions seem to be progressing at perfectly respectable rate.


I've listed several other uses that you've chosen to ignore or hand wave away. Besides, it doesn't need to have any other purpose beyond being a decentralized immutable permissionless database. That's enough on its own.


The internet was 10 years old in the late 80s. Took another 10+ years after that before it was "mainstream". The computer was 10 years old in the late 40s. Took another 30+ years before it was mainstream. 10 years is nothing for something as novel, groundbreaking, and paradigm shifting as bitcoin.


This isn't a competition. I'm not trying to say anything is better than anything else. Like I said in a previous post: gold, cash, btc, all have their use cases and are not mutually exclusive.


Sure, but like I said, so is gold and cash and almost everything else we currently value except for a small handful of things that I already listed. So your argument basically claims that nothing has intrinsic value except food, water, shelter, etc...


Maybe traditional concepts of intrinsic value don't make sense for bitcoin? I don't know. But, we know bitcoin has value as an immutable store of value with no central authority to tell us if/when we can use it. Your bank accounts could potentially be frozen at any moment. Your cash can be seized. If I follow certain procedures I can potentially make my bitcoin unseizable. These features are valuable, it can't be denied. Especially for individuals who live in countries with irresponsible or exploitative governments. There is no other digitally transferable economic tool that fulfills these parameters. That is its intrinsic value.
I've asked you several questions throughout our conversation that you have ignored. Like "What is the intrinsic value of the internet" and as the digital/virtual world consumes more and more of our reality "what assets do you think will hold the most value within it?"


Well that would be incredible, and would certainly be one of the most incredible achievements of mankind, but unfortunately I think it probably breaks some laws of reality, ha.


The redundancy doesn't make it slow, what makes it slow is a combination of the 10 minute block cycle, and the block size. Again, illustrating your need to further your technical understanding of bitcoin. It is what makes it inefficient however, but the inefficiency is required for achieving all the incredible aspects that I've mentioned. Our legal system is insanely slow and inefficient, but it is necessary for what that system achieves. And you want to talk slow and inefficient, let's just compare it to traditional banking for two minutes. You can move a billion dollars on the bitcoin network and have it guaranteed to settled in 10 minutes (on average) for a couple hundred bucks. If you don't mind waiting an average of 20 or 30 minutes you can move it for a couple bucks. With traditional banking this would take at least a few days, if not a whole week to settle, and it would cost orders of magnitude more.

So unnecessarily aggressive and insulting. No need for that. Name calling and personal attacks don't make for a stronger case.


Yes, you can have *a* blockchain without bitcoin, but not *the* blockchain, no. And there is really no need for any other blockchains. Why would we need more than one immutable and open ledger? That's like saying we need a second internet. Pretty much any attribute that bitcoin doesn't have that you wish it had can potentially be programmed with a second layer solution. Sure, I could make a second internet that runs on a different network than the world wide web, but what purpose would it serve? It just isn't necessary, and over time everyone would want to be on the same network anyways.


A centralized blockchain is just an extremely inefficient database and makes absolutely no sense.


I literally just explained that it's value would only be 7% of its current market value if just valued for jewelry and industry. Not exactly "huge value"


Again, 93% of gold's value is solely from trading, so this isn't much of an argument. Also, the bitcoin blockchain has value beyond trading, it can be used as method for digital identity, which Microsoft is currently working on:
it has use as a method to digitally notarize:
and bitcoins are the worlds first non-duplicable digital assets, which is a really big deal for reasons that I shouldn't need to explain.


Uhh, the power would literally have to go out everywhere across the entire world and all copies of the blockchain would have to get wiped somehow in order for me to lose access to my coins. Why is that something you're worrying about? If that happens we will have much bigger problems then losing our bitcoin. If the power goes out across the entire world and never comes back on, we're all broke, whether we're in bitcoin or not.


Have you ever looked into how wasteful mining gold is? How much power do you think the entire global banking system uses? All those banks and skyscrapers full of lights and air conditioning and computers running nearly 24/7, or at minimum 8hrs/day 5days/week. Bitcoin miners are much more likely to use renewable electricity sources because it is much cheaper electricity, and mining facilities can be anywhere because geographical location doesn't matter. In fact, most mining facilities source excess hydroelectric energy that would have just gone to waste, since it is one of the cheapest sources of electricity. And they are often in cold climates where they can use the outdoor air for cooling. Major banks, on the other hand, need to be in areas of high population concentration where the electricity is usually from non-renewable sources. Here's an article going more into depth about how the reports of bitcoin being bad for the environment are all based on bs:


This is actually an essential part of what gives bitcoin its inherent value. Because the blockchain is redundantly copied a thousand times over it is an incredibly secure database. 10,000 nodes could get destroyed, but as long as one survives, the record is preserved. This makes it far safer and more trustworthy than any centrally controlled database.
All your rebuttals seems to just completely ignore all the rationale I've already brought up, making arguments that I've already presented evidence against, and your response has gotten very aggressive, which leads me to believe that you are very emotionally invested in your belief that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Try to overcome your cognitive dissonance and look at bitcoin from an unbiased perspective, you may be surprised by what you find. I can tell you still have a lot to learn. By the arguments you make, your understanding of bitcoin and the purpose/function of the blockchain are extremely narrow. Like, someone who thinks the internet's use value is just for email, narrow.

Adoption is creeping at about the same rate as always (slowly). I'm not sure why you're trying to narrow its use to just that of a currency, it can be used for much more. It functions as a currency, commodity, security, investment tool/vehicle, settlement system, remittance network, payment processor, etc... all rolled into one. So to look at its adoption you would have to look at its growth in use for all those things, not just in its use as a currency, which so far it hasn't been as successful with as its other uses. But it has definitely seen huge rise in adoption as an investment tool recently. And smaller but still healthy rise in adoption as a settlement system and remittence network.
Its volatility has gone down. It used to have 1000&amp; gains followed by 70&amp; (or more) drops on a yearly basis (sometimes more than once a year even). We've only seen a big price swing like that happen once in the past 4 years.
And I would say that definitely more people trust in it now than they did a year or two ago or more. Since November I'm not as sure, but a 6-month time frame is pretty short sighted for an asset most people currently view and use as a long term investment asset. It is now regularly discussed on mainstream financial investment television shows. Mainstream financial firms are looking at it much more seriously now also. Governments are taking it much more seriously and are actually making moves towards better regulation. ETF approval looking closer than ever. And many other signs that it is gaining trust and credibility in the mainstream, but it would honestly make this post way too long. And it already is too long, lol.

Bitcoin's inherent value is its network. It has the largest network and the largest market cap by a fairly large margin. Of course there is potential for another cryptocurrency to dethrone it (many people use the myspace vs facebook analogy). But many think bitcoin may be immune to this because it has such a huge lead and base of loyalists already. Also, because it is open source, as long as the best developers are focusing on it over other cryptocurrencies it will always have the most pertinent features and can't really fall victim to having misguided leadership.

Mac OS would be an example of a Unix flavor with a proprietary license, and Ubuntu (which is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian, and Linux itself is technically a flavor of Unix) would be an example of a flavor of Unix with an open source code. From what I understand Unix has basically been open source since 1974 (Unix V6 [1975] was the first to become available outside Bell Labs -- it became the basis of the first version of Unix developed at the University of California Berkeley) although a company that builds their own proprietary OS based on Unix has the right to keep the new source code closed if they so wish, of course.
"After the CACM [1974] paper, research labs and universities all over the world clamored for the chance to try out Unix themselves. Under a 1958 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, AT&amp;T (the parent organization of Bell Labs) had been forbidden from entering the computer business. Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product; indeed, under the terms of the consent decree, Bell Labs was required to license its nontelephone technology to anyone who asked. Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disk packs — each, according to legend, with a note signed 'love, ken'."
There is much more relevant information in that chapter of *The Art of UNIX Programming*; it's title is "Origins and History of Unix, 1969-1995" chapter 2.

This is where second layer solutions come in, as I stated in my last reply.


I said the exact opposite. So, not sure where you're getting that from. I think you just failed comprehension when I said "A centralized blockchain is just an extremely inefficient database and makes absolutely no sense." maybe?


Sure, it is still early, so totally valid to be skeptical. Bitcoin is still very early itself, so I get your overall skepticism for the same reason. I disagree that this doesn't seem extremely promising. Solves major issues with internet identification systems and provides massive convenience for users. And usually providing massive convenience to users all but guarantees successful ventures. Doesn't need to cost anything up front to users. Would just be a service included with your Microsoft account I'd assume. I'm assuming a fee of some kind would maybe have to be made every time you use the ID key, but, like with other second layer applications, that fee would be very small fractions of a penny, so whatever. But with the amount of usage it would get those fractions of a penny would add up to some kind of value for the company. Although, I'm not even sure if they are looking for financial value out of this tool. They are probably mostly just interested in it for building their brand out.


Non-duplicable physical assets aren't special though. They have existed since the literal dawn of time, and are restricted by the properties of being physical. Bitcoin is the first time in human history that we have been able to create something non-duplicable and also not restricted by physicality (i.e. with all the benefits of being digital). This had never been done before and is an incredible achievement. It is clear that as we progress into the future the things we used to do physically will become more and more replaced by digital analogs. This trajectory is quite clear, just stop for a minute and think about how digitized your life has already become in just the first few decades of PCs and the internet. Your money is mostly digital, your personal data is mostly digital, your media/music/movies/literature, a large portion of your communications are through digital mediums, the list goes on. Many believe that as virtual reality technology gets better and better we will likely start living large portions of our lives in virtual digital spaces. Makes sense considering how much of our lives we already spend on computers with two-dimensional displays and some buttons, a far more primitive digital environment. As this digital world grows more and more prominent, what assets do you think will hold the most value within it?


What are you talking about? My local outage would do nothing to the payment system itself. It could maybe disconnect some point of sale services depending on the store's set up. And unless the outage lasts more than a day I'll be fine accessing bitcoin on my smartphone with my remaining battery charge. Could also pull out my portable backup battery charger for an additional 5 full charges if I need it. Never heard of a 4g internet outage before, but even if that did occur, I could always use my satellite internet connection running off my generator. But credit card readers and ATMs wouldn't work unless running on backup generators either, right?


In end of days scenario, all people will care about is food, water, shelter, clothes, gasoline, firearms, sex, pharmaceuticals/medical equipment, and luxury consumable items like cigarettes, booze, soap, toothpaste etc... What are people going to do with your gold? Make jewelry and electronics? Lol. Of course my usb of bitcoins will be useless in end of days scenario, but so will mostly everything else. Again, not too worried about end of days scenarios.


Don't know if you've noticed, but bitcoin is now a non-trivial part of our economy. Its market cap is equal to that of a major fortune 500 company or a small nation state.


Ok, I think I've already made the argument that bitcoin has plenty of intrinsic value pretty clear at this point, and even linked to outside sources of highly respected economists with insights on the topic who also support that position. So, this whole paragraph's argument falls apart at that point. Once you fully wrap your head around the fact that a non-duplicable and fungible digital commodity secured by an unhackable and immutable network is a ground breaking achievement that helps pave the way for a digital future for mankind on nearly the same level that the internet did, maybe it'll sink in. Just a little bit, maybe? Followup question: What is your assessment of the intrinsic value of the internet?


If the network stopped tomorrow millions and millions of people would suffer economic loss and it would be a step backwards in the history of technological development. Doesn't sound like much benefit.


Your example of a customer database has no use for that kind of redundancy. A network with no central authority that stores hundreds of billions of dollars of the world's economy, on the other hand? Yea, I'll take all the redundancy I can get. Yes, this makes the base layer slow, expensive, and inefficient, as you said, but it is ultimately worth it for the security. And, I'll say it again, there are second layer solutions (feel like I'm going in circles here).


I haven't ignored them, I've addressed them head on with valid counter-arguments and even provided you with citations from prominent well-respected economists with supporting insights who have a much better grasp on macro-economics and monetary theory than either you or myself.

Bitcoin and paper cash cannot be compared in this way, at all. Bitcoin is interesting because it is a currency with a payment processor and user network built into it. Bitcoin, the currency, and its payment processor/network are inseparable. It is like as if paper cash also came with an open source paypal built into it somehow. So saying "Bitcoin is backed by trustless algorithms and computing power which gives the currency its value." is actually more like saying "Paypal's value comes from its network size, brand, and software patents." Just the amount of time people have spent coding bitcoin alone is probably worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Thousands of hours of some of the world's most talented software engineers and cryptography experts, that's part of what gives bitcoin its value. The other part is the network itself.

No one said the banks have an obligation to bank an unprofitable or unreliable client, so you’re just fighting a straw man with that argument. Nor did I come here to discus bank policies, just to explain that racism is a one sided affair because the word implies a race that is systemically disenfranchised and oppressed by definition (and systemic oppression can only go in one direction, obviously). You’re right though, that in a large part those who are unbanked often don’t have any savings and therefore have a hard time keeping a checking account. Although there are other reasons too. Accessibility is one, there are statistically more banks in white neighborhoods than black ones. Also blacks are less likely to have a car, making trips to the bank more tedious. Sometimes it has to do with privacy as well, we all know blacks are disproportionately victims of a corrupt criminal justice system, and may want to keep as much off record as possible. I don’t know the subject of the book, but bitcoin would solve all those problems. My best guess is that’s what the book’s about, but I’d love to hear from the OP.

I want bitcoin to be like bitcoin. A digital asset that transacts through a permissionless and immutable ledger. If you want to use it as a store of value or hedge against other investments, like we do with gold, feel free to use it that way. If you want to use it as a currency, feel free to use it that way as well.


But the blockchain, which again is an inseparable part of bitcoin, has other uses, which I have already mentioned several times now. And even if bitcoin had no other use other than trading, it doesn't really need any others because that is quite a useful trait on its own, especially when you consider that it's trades are recorded permanently and immutably on the blockchain.
And you're still, once again, evading the question "What asset in that digital/virtual reality will hold the most value?"

I just wanted to have a conversation and hear a logical thought out argument for market demand driven by higher fees. Because the original post didn't really make any sense to me. Your main proposition was: "If there is no fee market there will be no fees for miners and thus little to no hashrate." Why would lower fees mean lower hashrate? Fees have gone down from around $50 a transaction to $.05 a transaction in the last 6-months but hashrate has gone up from 15E hash/s to 40E hash/s in the same time frame. So your main talking point doesn't even match the data. Wasn't trying to insult you, it was just an argument I never heard before and didn't make sense to me so I was curious to have a discussion about it.

No but using combustion you transfer the energy from the gasoline into your pistons which power your drivetrain. What fuels the car is the energy once you break down the process to that level. In my analogy I also used electric batteries as an example of fuel for a car. The electrical charge in the chemicals in the battery never get destroyed, just transferred from one form to another.
Anyways, I don't really understand how any of what you are arguing against has anything to do with discrediting my analogy. You're just presenting a straw man argument.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:09:50
That makes almost no difference whatsoever in my analogy though. And when I send someone my Bitcoin it transfers wallets and is basically gone forever as far as I am concerned. And in the inverse argument technically the fuel doesn't just disappear and go away forever, energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed from one form to another. Much like Bitcoin moving around wallets.

There are still quite a lot out there, although they don't run on the same "business model" as they did back in the early days. Back then faucets were meant as a way to get people into bitcoin and give them a little bit to play with so they could see how it works. The idea was to give it away and promote usage, therefore bitcoin would gain value and legitimacy as more and more people used it. Nowadays faucets are actually websites that are filled with advertisement banners (that the website gets paid for) and then they pay you a tiny bit of crypto as incentive for viewing the webpage. So these sites actually encourage "Faucet farming"
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:37:21
It is possible, although extremely unlikely. But if bitcoin actually succeeded at becoming a world reserve currency I don't think it would be that far fetched. So much of it would be hoarded and so much of it lost permanently. Who knows what will happen in the future, be ready for any outcome. I use about 10 faucets at a time while I'm at work and just collect from them every hour, it is literally no sweat off my back at all. Some of them also have lotteries for which they give out free tickets and such where you could potentially win quite a lot of bitcoin. Its no risk but a potentially high reward. What's to lose?
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:56:07


This is definitely true. And there are some faucets I've come across that are definite scams. Most of them do things like make the minimum for withdrawal a number that is just above what the site will allow you to generate so you never actually get the earnings off the site into your own private wallet. And I don't doubt that some of them use your processor for mining in the background. All the faucets that I am recommending people use seem legitimate as far as I can tell and I've been using them almost daily for a few months now and have successfully withdrawn about .002 btc in total to my private wallet.

Also, I didn't say "that bitcoin is like a fuel in that it does xyz." I said that in the same sense that cars can run on electric batteries the drug trade can run on the bitcoin blockchain. Just because more cars run on gasoline doesn't mean that they don't also run on batteries. Analogous to the fact that just because most drug trade relies on fiat doesn't mean it can also use bitcoin. Never in my initial comment did I say Bitcoin was like a fuel.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:18:21
You could also use faucets. They give out very very small quantities of BTC, but it is basically free. I've been using faucets for like 2 years, while at work on my work PC, and I think I've accumulated like $60 worth total so far. So you only get a few cents everyday, but over time it adds up.

"For every 5000 candles, 1 candle contains 1 token that may be redeemed for 1 Bitcoin, 2 candles contain 1 token each that may be redeemed for .5 Bitcoin, and 50 candles contain 1 token each that may be redeemed for .01 Bitcoin."
So for every 5000 candles they use $22,500 worth of BTC. They charge $45 per candle, so if you were to buy them all that's $225,000. Subtract the value of BTC in the candle and that leaves us with $202,500. Divided by 5000 equals $40.50. You're buying a $40.50 candle and $4.50 worth of crypto (once averaged out statistically).

Much like the electric battery isn't responsible for the car, it just aids them. And the fact that gasoline aids more cars doesn't change the fact that batteries do too. Whether it is a newsworthy or appropriate headline is another question though.

All currency is similar to fuel in a certain sense, anyways.
We acquire fuel so we can use it to make something happen without having to do it ourselves. I want a gear to turn but I don't want to sit there cranking it manually, so I put some fuel in a motor, spark the combustions, and voila, it turns.
We acquire currencies because we want to make things happen without having to do them ourselves. I want an apple, but I don't want to plant an apple tree and wait for it to reach maturity and pick an apple off of it, so I give some money to an apple dealer, they hand me an apple, and voila, I have my apple.
In both cases my fuel/currency is used up. It is no longer tangibly mine. If I want to power more motors, or buy more apples, I need to acquire more fuel or currency.
It is in this sense that they are using the term fuel. Bitcoin fuels commerce. The drug trade is a type of commerce just like any other and it requires currency to run. In much the same way a car needs fuel to run.
If you can't see how this analogy works then I really don't know what to say.

Technically that would be 1.2k-1.3k, but I’ll accept 2k as a round up. Also, no crash had ever even come within 50% of the previous ATH. So yea, probably won’t go below 2k either.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:33:18
In no case has a bull market crash ever fallen below the previous bull markets ATH. So crashing below 15k wouldn't make much sense if following previous patterns. If following the pattern the bull run would go to somewhere between 100k-400k and the crash would bottom out around 40k-60k.

Logarithmic scale is a more visually clear way to look at data that spans many orders of magnitude. In a linear graph, previously large movements get so dwarfed by later movements they are rendered pretty much invisible. Also, price movements usually work in percentages. If you start at $10 and go up 1000% you land at $100, an ROI of only $90. If you start at $100 and go up 1000% you land at $1000, a return of $900 which is much larger than the $90 even though the percentage change is still the same. Logarithmic graphs help even out that discrepancy in price movements at different orders of magnitude.

I would say that classically the first definition is correct. And in Bitcoin’s case its intrinsic value is that it can be used to record value transfer on the most immutable ledger of all time.
Your second definition is, I think, a sort of investors definition: “The perceived or calculated value of an asset, an investment, or a company.” in which case Bitcoin’s intrinsic value is the size of the network itself.
Trying to calculate bitcoin’s value as if it were a company is a bit of a fool’s errand. A company owns assets and produces revenue. But bitcoin isn’t a company. It’s just an open source protocol. More like tcp/ip (the protocol that serves as the foundation of data transfer for the internet). So, using the tcp/ip analogy, imagine if the internet ran on a limited hard capped number of data packets that had an exchange value. When the internet’s “network” was still relatively tiny, not as many data packets would be needed to be sent around, but as the network increased in size those data packets would obviously increase in value because there would be more and more demand for them and the supply would be limited. This is why calculating Bitcoin’s intrinsic value (using your second definition) is pretty much entirely correlated to the network’s size. As that size increases, bitcoin’s intrinsic value does also because demand for them would increase but the supply is limited and hard capped.

I've never heard anyone call investing "spending". It's actually quite the opposite. When I go to the movies or out to a restaurant I am spending money. I just paid for something I can never liquidate or receive any monetary return for what I purchased at future date. When one buy's bitcoin, or any other asset or investment vehicle, it is with the intention to save/hold that investment, circumventing the gradual and inevitable devaluation of government issued currency via inflat, so that it can be liquidated at a future date for more than the dollar amount they purchased it for.
So, not spending money at all. More like saving money, but in a smarter and more financially efficient way.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:43:20
For sure. And even more selling pressure when it hits 20k and people like your friends realize they can get out at what once was the top. Thing is, all the wise crypto investors that have been around for a while will see all the signs in place for another hype cycle and will be buying it up like crazy so they can ride it up into the 6 figures.

Basically. Cryptocurrency is a term that incompasses any and all tokens in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Bitcoin is considered the first, and is certainly the most dominant.

Also, production cost varies heavily based on certain variables including: cost of electricity, climate, source/cost of hardware/rigs, cost of property the facility is located on, etc...

If a larger amount that you want to keep extra secure, use a trezor or a ledger hardware wallet. But, also keep in mind that if you take your crypto off exchange you are now solely responsible for keeping the seed safe and secure somewhere that you can always access if you need to. With the exchange, if you ever forget your password there are ways to recover your funds.

Would it also make it easier for the ETF custodian to insure losses (like, due to theft/hacking or technical errors)? Or is it no different than the current basic exchanges out there (Coinbase, Gemini, etc...) in that regard.

Actually, when you put it like that it makes fiat sound good. Instead of a hand full of people losing their entire life savings and probably severely harming them both emotionally and materially, they get made whole financially by just taking fractions of a percentage of value from everyone else. An amount so small it goes by practically unnoticed by the general population, but when added all up saves the handful of people from torment.
Of course, something like this could be arranged with crypto also, it would just be public and transparent and cause a huge outcry from less empathetic or more ruggedly individualistic people.

It’s an easy question to answer too. The network itself is the “intrinsic value.” It’s a decentralized currency with a censorship resistant payment processor built into it, that’s the value.

There will likely never be a world "without others forcing their will on" others. There will probably always be a world where at least one person has a want that can't mutually exist with another person's want and they will then attempt to exert their will over the other person's will. Bitcoin does not solve this problem, unfortunately.

This is cool. Although still more complex than things like venmo or cash app. In my opinion users shouldn't even see their public key unless they go into settings or something. Would be more accessible if users just have a username associated with their keys, and the username is all that's seen on the front end. When a normal person sees a public key it looks foreign, uninviting, and intimidating. They may get confused and be not sure if they are doing it right. There's really no reason an average person should need to see their keys ever. When I send someone money on cash app or venmo I don't see routing and account numbers.
