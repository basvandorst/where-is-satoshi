XRP hasn't moved all year.  It really comes down to if you believe in it and how patient you are.  Up to you to determine if it's really worth it.

If you solely want to profit off BTC then Robinhood isnt bad.  Only thing is when the market is experiencing momentum, trying to lock in limit sell orders can be difficult .

I use acorns to roundup my everyday purchases from my CC to passively invest the spare change into Moderately aggressive portfolio.  
Robinhood i use for swing and scalp trades . With robinhood you can pick specific stocks that you want to invest in. 
Whereas vs Acorns you are limited to the default portfolios that they selected for you.
