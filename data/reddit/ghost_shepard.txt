Like the Republicans are doing with their newest bill? ;)

Oh, I’m sure comrade. I’m sure you have many glorious accounts for dear leader. In Russia, reddit browses you! ;)

Uh, right with you til the out of nowhere Russia shilling. Jesus fucking christ, I can’t believe this subreddit is so receptive to Russian trolls down-playing their interference in the U.S. elections.

Oh shit, I didn’t realize you were retarded. I mean, I just assume, given the amount of projecting that’s occurring in every single one of your posts and how obsessed you are with deflecting from your own mental handicaps. :)

Yeah, that’s my point. I’m needling him for championing the Republicans even as they rob us blind.

Look, a video from your home country!

Guess that depends on how much influence they’re afforded by bitcoin users. Seems like a lot of bitcoin owners are more than happy to trade bankers and the US surveillance state for Putin. It’s a lateral move at best.

Yeah, as soon as he stops paying shills to post here to scam and mislead users. :)

Um sure, but that doesn’t invalidate the claim and evidence of Putin ordering the hacking of the RNC and the DNC and then committing criminal conspiracy with Trump. Or the decades of financial crimes and money laundering committed by Trump, Putin, and the Russian oligarchs, not to mention a lot of the “rich people on the coast.” I just don’t get why you’re defending one while criticizing the other. They’re all guilty of many of the same crimes, though I would argue Trump and Putin have been more overtly guilty than some. Regardless, I can’t fathom being a supporter of bitcoin while defending the elite (Trump, Putin) it’s meant to help free us from.

Goddamnit I want bits to take off so badly. It’s so simple, works perfectly as a more casual expression for more casual purchases, and actually emphasizes what bitcoin is, a collection of verifiable data.

I’ve been here 4 years. You’ve been here two days. I think the better question is when did the conservacucks start overrunning the subreddit dedicated to wealth redistribution software. ;)

You think people expressing passion and excitement through art and dialogue is a “blight” on bitcoin? Even as bitcoin has been under an actual existential attack all this year? 
Get the fuck over yourself you pretentious child.

Except that it’s a currency and thus for the investment to truly pay off there must at some point be a large number of “fanatics”, as you would call them, who use bitcoin almost exclusively. You don’t actually understand what bitcoin is or what provides it value.

I like how your comment thoroughly explains itself.
