Where is your proof that it is more likely to fall after an ATH than to climb? We've literally been making ATH daily for months. Same with eth which I trade in. If you waited for a dip for either one you would have missed out on a shitload of gains. You are giving out terrible advice.

Yes - he is referring to when Eth split into Eth and ETC due to a DoS attack - but nobody "lost" their coins. The Eth got transferred to a new chain and the Etc stayed as is and still has value, hence you seeing Etc on coinmarketcap still.

This is such a dumb sentence. At once point the all time high was 100. So it's wasn't smart to buy then? What about 200? 500? 2000? When do you consider it smart? When it drops to 1999?

absolutely not. This guy has no idea what he is talking about. Good lord.

This is literally from the Polo website. [Polo]( You can go to cryptocompare and read about the history of the fork as well, including the original DAO attack, subsequent DoS attack that was supposed to fix it all, and the hard fork that resulted. [source]( Note that nowhere in ANY of this does it say people lost their tokens due to the fork.

please stop with this. You have no idea what you are talking about.
