Why would the rich and middle class in poor countries buy it? lol.
To what end? To use it where and how?

Some people like to talk about bitcoin without having any bitcoin.
Why is that unproductive and unhealthy?


Pigeonholing all opinions by people that aren't invested is hilariously short-sighted.


The people that don't have bitcoin are significantly less concerned than you are about the success of bitcoin. Consider your own biases, my friend.

I wouldn’t take bitcoin as payment as soon as it showed a real downwards trend. I’m sure I’m not the only person that would run a business like that. Wouldn’t you?
If $1 of bitcoin today was to be worth $2 of bitcoin next month, I would take it every time. If $1 of bitcoin today was to be worth $.50 next month, I would never accept that currency.
Not even vendors are treating it like a real currency.
In fact, when was the last time you used bitcoin to buy anything?

I don’t see enough adoption of it as currency for it to ever be useful. Literally all I ever hear about it is its value in relation to the USD. In my real day-to-day life it is treated like a stock by everyone I know that has any interest in it. And they would all “cash out” as soon any legitimate trouble appeared on the horizon.

So you don’t think of it as a currency in any capacity? And apparently no one in this entire thread does? Because I don’t see how bitcoin will last as long as people continue to treat it like a stock. It’s your type of thinking, along with everyone else here, that has absolutely convinced me that bitcoin has no real longevity. Not because governments would regulate it, but rather that the greedy people “investing” in it won’t ever treat like a real currency. They will sell once the popularity wanes and bitcoin will pitter out.

I have a buddy that is enamored by bitcoin and I can’t convince him that most people using it aren’t treating it like a currency at all. It’s basically a stock with no real value. There will be a reckoning for bitcoin once all those people dip.

I see now. But what’s the purpose of even using bitcoin at that point? Why do that instead of using fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:35:10
That does very little to resolve the huge swings that come over the duration of a week or more. Locking in the price for the duration of a transaction does not at all address the issue I brought forward initially, which is that vendors will not tender bitcoin when the value drops. The only reason they do it now is because they have a chance to make some real money until the bubble bursts.
All I’m saying is that bitcoin is not being treated like a currency by pretty much anybody. And if bitcoin is not a currency, then it has no redeeming qualities. The only people fucking with bitcoin right now are just people trying to make a quick buck.

Can you elaborate?
I spend 2 bitcoin today. The price quadruples next month. Is the company going to come in and reimburse the difference on demand? Otherwise, I do not understand the “solution” these companies provide.

lol. I love it.
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:51:28
You know exactly why there are none.

Pick a fallacy.

If I’m understanding this correctly, you and your wife are asian, and your mother wanted to see if your wife was having a baby from a white donor?
