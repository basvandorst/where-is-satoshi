Totally agree : Bitcoin is Bitcoin, not anything else.

There's plenty... like GetBittr

I have set up a weekly wire to Bittr and I receive my btc every week without default and with low fees. It works amazingly well.

Watched it 5 hours ago : great doc, a lot of things I didn't know while I purchased my first few years ago already. I also understand better the war between former members of the same team.
Silbert does look like a moron.

You meant "green are the ones that have withdrawn from it so far"

Je viens de le finir. Ça aurait pu être pire avec France 2. Le plus horrible reste l'interview de fin.

I know but usually, it's fast from a segwit address even with low fees and I used the highest fees available from my trezor : b6d5d5cadb7fe47918916fd2afe8c727a13a1b220dfc55f39ad99769b649f254
Edit : it's ok, it finally went through

I own both. Before purchasing, I thought I would prefer Ledger but in the end, Trezor is my favourite. So, I use Trezor to store my BTC &amp; LTC because the UI is really cool and simple, and I use my Ledger with MEW for my ETH &amp; ERC's. 
I hate Ledger apps, that's why I have split my coins like that.

Usually it's the opposite : renewable energy is wasted if... you don't use it.
