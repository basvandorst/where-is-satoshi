i used a currency converter to trade BTC to ADA then transfer it.
and if it's gone, where did it go? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:08
isn't that the entire purpose of the currency converter - to convert currency from one to another?

Going to have to wait and see tomorrow at work. I don't have my ADA wallet at home

then what does the "converter" part of currency converter mean if it doesn't convert from one to the other?  the whole point of coinswitch to exchange from one currency to the other.

that seems like an inefficient system

my address was there but it shows a balance of zero.
here's what I did from step one:
i went to my ADA wallet and got my address.
I went to coinswitch and entered in my ADA address.
I i got an address FROM coinswitch to deposit by BTC.
I went to my BTC account and transferred to that coinswitch address.
It cleared and now I see unspent coins sitting in the blockchain with no way to send them to my ADA account.

i own BTC.  I wanted to trade a bit for ADA.  I went to coinswitch, which does currency conversion.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:10
can you please explain why and how this happened?  i followed the directions on coinswitch exactly
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:09:17
I see the transaction sitting unspent on the BTC blockchain server.  it's weird by bitcoin wallet sent the money to coinbase (which had my ADA wallet address) but it never got sent.  i see it sitting there.

thanks for the help

Why do they make it so confusing?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:20:00
so you think it could be the transaction was confirmed but it is unspent and not deposited in my ADA account because the system is slow?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:48:55
it's already been taken out of my coinbase wallet.  
i see it sitting in an unidentified wallet that i'm not sure how to access

a currency converter failed to convert my currency even though i followed specifics directions step-by-step.  please explain where i messed up from a technical perspective
