here's a guide on how to import your wallet.dat into electrum:  
  
Please make sure to read it completely before actually doing it and be sure that you understand what you're doing, to prevent misstakes that could cause a loss of Bitcoins.
Disclaimer: I havn't checked if you need to let Bitcoin-QT download the entire chain before you can do these steps, but it's definitely worth the try.

I honestly think that even if you just throw 50$ into it before the end of next year, you'll easily still be in "super early". (The earlier the better ofc.) Can't say anything about the time past that, since bitcoin is still growing up and I can't seem to find my crystal ball at the moment.

I have no idea what you expect. Of course you won't be able to finance your live by doing absolutely nothing, but being able to avoid taking up a credit for your car/house/whatever sounds like a pretty big deal to me.

I'd be willing to argue that there never was a "get rich quick" moment. The time that could be called such in retrospect would be a technology in its infancy where nobody could've reliably said that it even gets as far as it now is. Just 6 months ago people would've probably not imagined 10k by the end of this year, so anyone who got into this tech years ago was most likely just incredibly lucky if they held on until now.
But I also have to apologize, since I probably read your posts incorrectly. Sorry if my text came across too aggressively because of that and thanks for the friendly argument.

Would you consider one year ago as "super early"?  
If not: got started around then, sold some for fiat a bit later because "hey i made 50$ from that thing, let's treat myself to something nice". Proceeded to forget about it for a while and am now sitting at somewhere between 1-2 BTC while regularily getting small amounts every so often. 
IDK what you consider "serious cash" but for me it's a nice feeling to know that I'm sitting at ~~~300%~~ ~450% of what I put in if I were to sell now. (Which i won't because I like the idea behind Bitcoin and the Blockchain)
Edit: forgot to recalculate from last month.

Question about SegWit from someone who hasn't understood the BIPs yet:  
What's the difference between a wallet where the addresses start with "3" (as seen in Bitcoin Core) and wallets where addresses start with "bc1" (as seen in Electrum)?  
Is there an advantage of using one compared to the other or is there some incompatibility between them?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:51
How it happened is a question that only you can answer, but the history of that wallet looks as follows:  
1) on 2013-12-06 there was **one** transaction sending 0.4BTC **into** the address.  
2) on 2013-12-18 there was **one** transaction moving 0.35BTC **out** of the address, leaving behind the remainder of 0.0499BTC.  
3) on 2013-12-24 there was **one** transaction sending ~0.036BTC **into** the address, giving us the current balance of 0.086686BTC in that address. It shows 3 "input" addresses because those 0.036BTC came from those three addresses (looks this way because the sender didn't have enough in one address, so their wallet used multiple) 
So to clarify: On blockchain.info one arrow equals one transaction, green arrow means it goes into that address, red arrow goes out of that address.
Speculation:  
you created the paper wallet and filled it in step 1, changed your mind in step 2 and decided to refill the wallet in step 3. The full correct story is probably somewhere in your brain :)  
If you have further questions feel free to ask.

i consider "spend and replace" to be the fancy combination of both.

I've checked the link that you posted in the comments and it looks you only allow shopping after logging in with a Google or Facebook account.  
Do you plan on allowing standard email-signups later on?
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:12:09
I'm in agreement with so far:  
The "Ford T of cryptocurrencies" will most likely be an easy to use wallet that takes care of all the technical hurdles that current cryptocurrency-users have to take or makes them easy to understand for non-technical users (like backing up &amp; securing the private key, reducing the risk of scams through address-swapping etc.).
I'm not sure what makes you think that only the actual wealthy will be able to access cryptocurrencies in the long run, so could you please elaborate on that? (struggling to come up with reasons for it myself, though maybe your concerns are valid)

At the sidebar, there's the "[Getting Started]( link which has usefull information and links to a few exchanges where you can buy BTC.  
Just always remember: If you don't have the private key, it's not your coins (aka: move anything you don't intend to convert out of the exchange into your secure wallet asap) and make an offline-copy of your private key to protect against hardware failure.
There's of course a lot of things that are recommended, but these two should protect you against the (imho) worst ways to lose your coins.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:25:40
"move(s)" instead of "move/s"  
to say "move or moves" the "(s)" would be the better choice.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:37:29
The way i see it, cryptocurrency was never meant to address the "social inequality" issue.  
I see it as a decentralised way of moving value around, without a single large entity (eg. Banks) deciding that your transaction is not allowed or that "your money" is now theirs.  
Depending on implementation, it also has the added bonus of giving back some privacy about what you spend and why.

Since i can't access twitter at the moment:  
Can i please get some info and/or direct links aside from a tweet?
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:53:01
you should've at least had someone proof read your website. Even as a non-native speaker I'm seeing a lot of spelling/grammar misstakes.  
also: Rule 4) please post about altcoins elsewhere, since this subreddit is focused on Bitcoin.

Iris and fingerprint can be easily stolen as well (passport-picture, "hold my beer" etc.) and you can't change them if compromised.  
Problem with heartbeat is that there's too many factors that can change it temporarily and/or permanently like stress, exercise etc.
Thats why people keep saying that you shouldn't rely on biometrics as authentication and instead use it as an additional factor on top of a secure password.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:17:57
several options, many of them probably connected:  
1.) treating BTC as a currency instead of a speculative investment  
2.) spreading awareness about BTC  
3.) they might not have fiat on hand and don't want to walk to the next ATM  
4.) ATM fees there are higher than BTC transaction fees (probably depends on the bank they use)
I'm sure there are more things that could be listed as motivation to do it, but I've got to return to work.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:22:49
Closed source and no access to the actual private key (only the mnemonic phrase).  
I'll pass on that one.
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:13:14
Correct me if i'm wrong but my understanding is that those miners are specialised for one algorithm only and as such won't be profitable for anything else.
@_date: 2019-01-30 07:59:32
Not sure what your reasoning for that is.  
I'd imagine this most likely drives the price up since more people get exposed to bitcoin and get some sort of access to it.  
Sure it'll probably spike and drop down after that again, but I'm unsure why it should drop lower than it currently is at that point.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:37:47
Idk, decentralised ID sounds like a promising project on layer 2 (the opensource project, not the hacked(?) "DID" token by Torquesol).  
Unless you think that layer 2 doesn't count.

Currently a holder, but I'm trying to move more into the direction of "actual bitcoin user" through spend&amp;replace transactions wherever possible.  
aka I buy something with bitcoin and then buy the same fiat-value of coins to get close to the BTC-amount I had before (rounded a bit because I'm lazy)

Are you focusing entirely on US tax-regulations or do you intend to offer your services worldwide?
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:50:56
Sounds like 4chan, just with hodl instead of triforce.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:38:05
The difference is that the Blockchain is not a singular product of a company with stocks like laptops or phones. The best analogy in that regard are the different cryptocurrencies that utilize blockchains.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:53:29
If you're afraid of an exchange not letting you cash out, spread the risk by using multiple exchanges to sell your bitcoin in smaller sums.  If you want to be extra safe you could probably start with say 10% of your total and wait for the fiat to arrive before selling the next 20% etc.
Big point you should always keep in mind: don't use exchanges as a wallet. Move fiat and bitcoin that you don't intend to trade in the near future to a secure wallet that you own and have backups of.
I'm just your average hodler and there's probably some more things to keep in mind as best practices, but this should at least allow you to dodge the worst nightmare-stories.

What's confusing about it? In my understanding it's just another Bitcoin Client.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:11:09
Thank you for taking the time to clarify what happened.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:37:43
I can see that he did that at one point in the past, though i can't seem to find any indication that it's still happening (Disclaimer: i havn't checked his entire github-repo, just the file where it was in the past and a few others. It's unlikely that i would be able to find it anyways since I'm not an experienced programmer).  
Also he apparently posted a public appology of some sorts:  
I do agree that the developer has some opinions and beliefs that seem unpopular and I disagree with his views as well, but unless there's a repeating history I'm willing to at least give him the chance to learn the right lessons from past mistakes.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:56:09
Why keep giving them fuel by giving them attention?  
I think ignoring the trolls that claim that "BCH is the true Bitcoin" and letting the market/consensus handle that decision would be the better move.  
I'm not seeing talk about any other altcoin on this subreddit aside from the constant BCH bashing.  
Sure, they have the btc-subreddit but if the coin is dead the subreddit will follow. So let them disappear into the background noise of other coins and focus on something more important like market adoption (or price-memes if that's your preference).
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:40:08
If you hold them for 1year or longer you don't have to pay tax on it (counts as speculative gain/loss).  
You should stil declare that gain on your tax report though to avoid issues and be prepared to prove that you held those speculative assets for more than a year before selling them.

considering that one bitcoin was ca. 100€ when i decided to join in and this amount is now just above 700€,  
i basicly traded two computer-games for twelve games by waiting four months. (that analogy sounds kind of wierd...)
