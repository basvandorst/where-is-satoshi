That's an issue with floating point numbers, yes. But it misses the point. If you want to do algebra with numbers like 1/3, nothing's stopping you from using or creating a rational type. A data structure with two integers and some functions describing how the algebra works on them. It's not a limitation of "computing" at all (which was the guy's understanding), the floating point standard is designed to be good and efficient for certain use cases and its limitations are well-known.

You're probably right that it was based on something like that, which is a real limitation (of floating point numbers). But one can't go on to say something like "computers can't really do algebra" based on that, because computability in general isn't constrained just because floats are. It's kinda ignorant for a prof to make a claim like that when all they know is a factoid or two about floating point numbers, and an entire field of other academics has been rigorously proving things about computability for decades.
It's not a big deal to not know things, but as someone who teaches programmers I would say a professor should be careful what claims they make if they're gonna be in the business of spreading knowledge. Of course I don't know the details really, this is just what went through my head.

Really though. We've already seen what people become when they're safely at home behind a screen interacting with people they'll never see in person. People would be dicks with their robots.

Unfortunately I think you're right.  The reason bitcoin's proof of work concept even works is because it's limited by something real (which is money, or equipment/power that is bought with money).  It always comes down to money, anything else can be faked, farmed or gamed.
I say unfortunately because it still leaves us in a situation where being richer gives you more say. But I can't imagine any other way for a decentralized thing to work "fairly".

Probably because it's more of a link dump than a story.

What is the point of the 5% that the seller puts in if not to go to the buyer if they claim they didn't get it? Still I agree that's not much. I think the percentage should be something agreed to by both parties (accounting for low reputation, maybe)

I've been thinking about the same thing, and it seems to me that the limitation is that it's hard to get fiat into many exchanges.  You basically need to have active accounts with a few of them and fiat money in those accounts to be able to take advantage of it.
Once you buy low at exchange A, and sell high at exchange B, you have fiat money in your exchange B account that you can't easily transfer... you can only withdraw it, and then deposit it elsewhere, which takes a while.  So unless you have lots of money to play with and can just keep your fiat accounts in many exchanges full of enough money to play with (more than you actually want to buy and sell at a time), I don't see how you can be responsive quickly enough.
So it's totally possible but there's a barrier to entry for most people. Especially if you don't live in the US.

That was my absolute favourite part.
