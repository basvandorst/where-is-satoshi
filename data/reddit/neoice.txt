if nation-states tie their economies to bitcoin, censorship is now a self-imposed economic sanction.

I think bitcoin is a majorly disruptive technology and if Satoshi doesn't have powerful enemies yet, he will soon.

the box holding the locking mechanism looks pretty vulnerable too. can I just smash it with a hammer?

it works with physical items too. value is a function of what someone will pay you for it. all your comic books and trading cards are worthless if you can't sell them.

with LTC rising, I'd love to diversify :P

signal interference. if more people are using Tor, it's harder to monitor the entire system. I've considered moving all my browsing to Tor just because I think it's an important system and that's one small way I can help other people remain anonymous.

this already happens. labs in China will copy anything they can and sell generics/knockoffs for pennies on the dollar.
many pharma companies are choosing to **not** patent their drugs. filing the patent provides details that foreign labs can use to clone the product. keeping the formula as a "trade secret" winds up being a better protection against foreign theft. patents only work if everyone follows them and legal systems enforce them.
as far as I know, pharma companies are still profitable and working to develop new drugs, with and without patents.

sure they will. don't companies need new products to enter new markets and entice buyers?
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:45:20
I think that's a service, not a good.

I can't believe people didn't think "hey, aren't for-profit prisons creating a terrifying economic incentive?"

I could see $10k by the end of the century. what does that work out to as a yearly ROI?

if I was a startup founder, could I simply issue my own colored coins and use them in the same way independently? or could I later "roll them into" the NASDAQ system?

somewhat offtopic, what are you using to get that data to Graphite? I &lt; Grafana.

ok, I'm hooked.
where can I read the longer version? are any implementation details known? doesn't the market move much, much faster than block generation?
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:08:45


yup, I read the article and I've seen colored coins before.


ok, that's the context I'm looking for, thanks :D

I think the power of Bitcoin is to couple free exchange of information with the flow of money. put a message in the block chain and there's a financial incentive to propagate it. good luck censoring/redacting it.

not a surprise. marijuana is still federally illegal. don't take your stash to federal property or national parks.
