Other than the exchanges and thinks like robinhood, coinbase, &amp; the cash app the atm is the alternative option

This me right now!
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:35:04
No just hope it goes there before the mass adoption
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:52:26
Why would they buy and hold when they can just take?
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:30:03
Better off just using an atm for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:29:12
Will you be recording the presentation? Im looking into purchasing a bitcoin atm myself but Im still new to everything about it and doing tons of research. Ive been trying to find some owner operators to learn from real life experience who can give me some tips on how to get started with as minimal cost as possible and what to look out for but its not much information on how and where to get started aside from the normal articles online. I would like to hear/see the presentation once you do it if possible.

Ok cool thanks. I also found some good info that might help you while doing my research. I went to  and it had some trainings on there that you might be able to inform them about. Again im a newbie so idk if it helps or not just figured it might be of some use for you.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:02:33
Ok well so do many others who dont have an issues with banking so obviously its working somewhere.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:57:13

@_date: 2019-07-15 01:33:39

@_date: 2019-07-31 00:18:53
Oh snap i definitely gotta come by!!
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:06:09
Why not just use a bitcoin atm?
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:26:40
I would but according to my track record that never works out well. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:00:27
Ill buy it from you for 0.5% more of what you cash out for
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:47:46
Just delete you contacts
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:00:54
Didnt know trump supporters would support bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-07-20 10:36:11
Ill scam you for half that
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:01:25
Trust me the moment they made a tax law about bitcoin is the moment they made this thing permanent. As an accountant I saw this coming and knew that was the it. It wont be shut down all they can do is try to contain it. And the moment it is adopted by the masses it will be to late. Whether it is legal or illegal as deemed by the government, it has been deemed something of value and therefore isnt going anywhere. Just watch the value of it go up and down. But nonetheless its worth something and cant be shut down.

Yes I have 2 separate accounts I set up specifically for the Money Service business. Ive heard about banks shutting down account if you dont disclose that before opening the account so i didnt want those problems i have it setup with both US Bank and CITI bank just have to provide them with some documentation and thats it. My other business account are for my other businesses are through wells fargo but thats a separate matter.

1. You dont actually own bitcoins in Robinhood 
2. Its FDIC insured up to $250,000 if they do get hacked.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:00:39
Im doing the same here in the US been researching for about 2 months. saving money to purchase my first one soon hopefully and talking with some locations about setting it up. Do a lot of research first. Lots of legal and technical things to know before getting started. May not be that way in the netherlands though.

Thanks I figured it would be but I already have an LLC setup, a business bank account as well. I just need to know more the operations and legal side of things and what to look out for. I’ll check out the link.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:57:24
Thats what Im trying to do
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:54:49
Oh you own and operate an atm?
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:36:56
What? We have a bitcoin ATM where im at in Cali and I cash out all the time. But i guess it depends on where you are located. But i mean technically you could use your bitcoin to purchase prepaid credit or debit cards.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:20:02
You guys do already know that other places buy and sell land &amp; homes with bitcoin right? Lol so essentially both you’re arguments are right and wrong at the same time. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:39:03
Probably because most bitcoin users dont support trump anyway so no effect on an intelligent community
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:14:21
Then its useless
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:37:46
To bad you cant say the same thing about the dollar.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:49:37
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:17:14
Im trying to i want bitcoin atm
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:09:13
Why not both
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:16:14
Some atms do
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:26:22
������������ this guy gets it
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:25:37
������Say it louder for the newbies in the back who dont know how to trade.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:24:33
No no no hes got a point. I work at the stock exchange as a marker and taking money from those stop loss idiots was easy. I mean unless you are not an active trader then it may be an ok idea but if trade actively we are gonna come for your stop loss limit until you can trade no more ��
