Can someone explain?  New to the subreddit...

I'd argue words have weight, no matter who says them.
I mean, hell, President Trump quotes random nobodies with no facts as if what they feel as truth translates to being the immutable truth, even when all of the data speaks to the alternative.
You then have the uninformed masses that take the headline as truth.  While they should do their own research, some either can't spare the time or simply won't, leaving the narrative to be defined by 160 characters.
It happens on both sides of the aisles...I've subscribed myself to every major news outlet from politics because in order to understand what everyone sees, it's best to do your own research.  But that's me tooting my own horn a little too damn much, haha

The audience that fivver seems to cater to is cheap, and therefore would be less likely to invest in bitcoins.  I'm not saying all, but if you're being realistic, then come on, we're talking paypal accounts and credit cards, aka your run-of-the-mill payment methods that the average joe are going to have.
I work in a high gross industry, and we still don't accept bitcoins.  I'm  introducing it to the powers-that-be as potentially necessary since our demographic have a growing interest, but for smaller businesses it makes practically no sense now.

I more or less agree.  When it comes to sustaining any sort of additional channel or process, many factors must be considered as you noted.  The fee increase certainly adds to the discussion of its removal, but I wouldn't overreach and explicitly state that it was the sole reason as Kristov did.
It came off rather reductionist, but that's the world we live in.  It's a lot of attention-grabbing half-truths / full lies...lol.  Anyway, on a brighter note, hope you have a good Thursday.
