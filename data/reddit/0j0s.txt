That sure sounds like a company waiting to gather enough data to spring at their own advantage. OMG I hope everyone steers clear. I'm keeping at bitcoin.de since the beginning and I hope they stay sound. Good luck with your funds bro...

Disgusting, unprofessional behavior from the staff at this website. I'd expect at least an apology email from them. Rather than posting to reddit though, I would have contacted other people on the website. But I hope this info will travel up, give a chance to other, maybe not so retarded people involved, to do the right thing by you.

Me too, I withdrew on May 1st and submitted a ticket to bitcoin-24, but still no replies and no activity on my btc address.  
*sigh*  
I just want my coins back at this point.

@_date: 2013-03-11 21:43:52

It seems honest, they're just swamped.

@_date: 2013-05-12 18:29:36
Really? When did you ask for the withdrawal?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:59:10
Thanks for a good laugh.
