Could you try setting up an ebook and getting paid in crypto?

@_date: 2019-12-17 15:59:20
Cant wait for halving in may 2020
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:01:05

u/diydude2 valid point. People are buying into crypto as price drops according to some coinbase charts
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:35:23
In all seriousness now, bitcoin will probably dip a little again from people cashing out on these "gains" and then start gaining solid momentum. Also the Trump impeachment kinda helps no? people loose faith in government/institutional fiat and start buying into the new concept of money?
Any update of Chinese ponzi scheme? Are there still another 20000 bitcoins to be recovered? This can effect price too.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:03:55
Some Chinese ponzi scheme got busted

@_date: 2019-09-24 14:12:08

@_date: 2019-09-23 15:19:20
So how does this news effect bitcoin? What can we expect to see or should anticipate for bitcoin if the FED has/is doing these actions?
