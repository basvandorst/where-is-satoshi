Can funds be transferred between Segwit and Legacy addresses? yes
Are the fee benefits only for Segwit-to-Segwit transfers? Well, yes, a segwit transaction takes less space, so the transaction will be cheaper than a comparable legacy transaction, but more segwit transactions will drive the sat/byte-price down for everyone as well.
Are the confirmation times any different? No.

Edit: Segwit transactions and Legacy transactions are compatible both ways which mean you can send funds from segwit address to legacy address or vice-versa.

That's what I just paid to withdraw from bitstamp, I don't have the TX atm, but according to bolockchain.info the avg tax-free is $47 now. I realize I can set the fee myself to 10sat/byte in most cases, but for transferring from an exchange I cannot. And my last withdrawal was 180 sat/byte
TX:  Actually more like $57 in fees

Weird, I've sent a support ticket to Bitstamp, but I've not had this issue before, as previous withdrawals have been around 10sat/B

What exchange would you recommend for european users?

$100 worth of BTC isn't really worth sending to a wallet when the average TX-fee is $40+, is it?

I find the official documentation to be a good resource. A raspberry pi is powerful enough to run a full node, however you'll need 250GB or more to hold the entire blockchain.
