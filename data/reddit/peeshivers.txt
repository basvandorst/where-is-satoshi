I've been in the bitcoin game for years, and I think that we're going to at realistically demolish $3k in the next year. People are underestimating the supply that the miners are currently unloading into the market each day. The halvening, even if a price increase front-runs it, will cause a sharp increase in price. But... we will be called "moon kids" until it happens...

No one knows 100%. However, the reward far outweighs the risk.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:32:02
Cool. I'll give it a try next time I'm in North Park.
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:31:40
Nice! I just bought a monitor from Newegg. Payment with Bitcoin was way faster than filling out my credit card information.
@_date: 2014-09-05 08:00:14
Wow. That is amazing to see live. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:49:09
How many BTC did the car cost?
@_date: 2014-07-15 07:08:20
I have been able to log in, but they put a freeze on my bitcoins. I cannot transfer out.
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:55:15
That was sweet. I wasn't aware of how Pheeva worked.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:41:19
This is amazing. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-13 08:20:08
420 blz it fgt.
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:48:18
Awesome idea. I would be interested as well.

I have to hand it to This title actually made me chuckle.

No idea. But she could use a toothbrush.
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:57:26
Nice! I bought the spaghetti cat shirt from you guys with btc and it arrived 5 days ago. Love your site!
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:21:53
Shouldn't they open registration earlier? They may not fill up all the spots.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:51:53
We don't need news. Just time.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:02:22
thanks! got it!
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:39:24
Yes. Hopefully in the next 2-3 months, but I could see it taking up to 3 years.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:02:48
Nice launch. Your site is a joke.

@_date: 2015-05-13 18:20:06
well then, fuck you too
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:25:22
I sure hope so.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:55:02
Cool. Could you get some prices listed?
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:11:13
get this man a coffee, on me. nice post. ;) 
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:43:20
Yes. I've bought t-shirts, a computer monitor, and some meds. I always buy some more btc when I spend it though.
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:18:46
Great idea, but I would include regular exchanging of USD so that you could include people that aren't into BTC yet. I don't think that enough people are into it yet. If I were to look for a ride for BTC, I doubt that I would be able to find anyone in my area. However, if it included drivers that wanted USD, I could see the app working. You would need a hell of a lot of marketing btw.

Yet... WSJ is writing about it...
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:05:16
As a hodler, I must say, the fees are a joke...

Bitcoin sparked my interest in investing/speculating. I have to thank bitcoin for being my first investment ever. It sparked endless hours of reading about financial markets and long-term investing. In the past 3 years, I've started and contributed to my RothIRA and invested in several stocks. I'm pretty sure if I had not started with bitcoin, I'd have nothing to show for portfolio-wise. I'm still young, so I'm excited for the future.

Headboard, watch, and basketball shorts from Overstock.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:31:12
Well done. Cheers.
@_date: 2015-03-26 07:20:26
This post deserves more upvotes. Good find.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:58:30
I don't think so. I'm pretty sure they have a very small staff. I had to use their online chat to get my btc withdrawn about a year ago.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:05:31
They just don't believe in speculation from an investing standpoint, which I understand. But the possible value of Bitcoin is too much to ignore, for me personally.
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:05:35
No, not lately.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:34:33
They should sponsor DOTA players/teams instead of NASCAR drivers.
@_date: 2013-06-20 06:55:24
Yes. Fuck banks.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:58:49
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:26:56
Too true. I'm aware that at some point the government may want to shut it down, however, I would like to know if I'd be sent to prison for it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:52:32
This might just be the deciding factor for me to attend this year.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:21:56
Congrats. This is huge.
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:12:17
Elon Musk. I would like to purchase a Tesla with Bitcoin someday. I think he is a visionary and would love to know how far he thinks it will go.
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:47:43
Thank you. This was exactly the answer I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:11:07
Where's to the moon guy?
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:55:03
If you're going to buy and hold, pretty much anytime is a good time to buy. China is awakening.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:39:35
China is driving this one.

It just did.

Bitcoin poker apps for phones. Also, first person shooters. A kill would earn you BTC, and a death would lose BTC.

Compared flights with Kayak.com and they're the same price. I will definitely be booking my flight to Puerto Rico though CheapAir.com.

I really didn't mean to state "over the currency." I apologize. The point I really meant to deliver is that it was used as payment for a hit.
