I used to own alts and I got out before the market crashed and BTC pumped. With the alt market down though, it may be a good time to buy.

Thinking like this is a symptom of rampant statism and not uncommon, I suspect. No surprise OP is from the UK, either.

What if you were to buy it coinbase and wash it with monero? What then?
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:54:12
It's PR for the people who give it and the people who receive it.  
   
None of this activity showcases the strength of bitcoin as a technology; they could just as easily paypal the money over.  
   
Also, lol at the 'single mother' begging for it in the comments.

Yea, he's pretty progressive/lefty for me, imo
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:40:52
Oh, he's done that before. I think you can get pretty easy read on his politics if you read between the lines of his other talks.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:24:59
Really? You just can't be bothered to fill out the forms?
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:34:05
Nice stack! And yea, hopefully

I don't tell people to buy BTC. I tell them about why it's an innovate technology, but it's so volatile I don't want them angry at me if and when it goes down.

It's in Euros.

Why does everyone here use robinhood?

I agree there will be a retracment at some point, but we don't know when and how much. If it goes to 18k and retraces to 13k, well then you should've bought now. I'm on the timeline of the 4-year cycle and buy a few times a month when I have money left over from my paycheck.
The goal is 100k+ in 2020 or 2021. Anything before then is distraction and noise.

All in on ZIL as of last night. Thinking after the mainnet launch I'll see whats up and put it all in bitcoin.

So crazy it just might work.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:01:33
Where do you buy bitcoin? I had some years ago through coinbase and am looking to get back into it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:11:30
Yea, my ZIL is slowly losing ground
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:31:33
@_date: 2019-05-05 03:31:44
I'm getting my boat, I'm getting my bitcoin, and I'm getting out.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:11:18
I assume this is sarcastic
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:51:01
quit a bit of what?
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:08:15
I've been buying the whole way down
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:21:12
This post is amazing.

No. I don't owe you my labor. I choose my customers.
