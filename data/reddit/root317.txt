That's incorrect, Gavin mentions this in the commit log. Stop spreading non-factual statements, please.

If a miner has solved a block, it's not cheating to be able to propagate that knowledge as quickly as possible.
It also saves other miners time by allowing them to focus on a new block. 
No reasonable person would consider this 'cheating' on any level. If it were, you should patch core's version to disallow this entirely.
There is also a 30 second timeout to prevent false 'found' block messages and a warning sent to peers when that happens (after which they get booted for that action).

Everytime you hear a *bleep* substitute it with *network failure*.
Then you realize that Blockstream employees (some core devs) are forcing Bitcoin to be a centralized 2nd layer settlement network for PNC and other big banks willing to pay them a premium.

Oh I agree, these exist. It's %0.5 of blocks.. that's half of 1 percent. Spam is insignificant on the network and has been during this debate, but people who don't understand that think people are 'attacking the network'. Which is pretty silly if you look at the numbers.

I'm glad you guys like Coinbase now. 
BTW, the only way more financial institutions can adopt Bitcoin is if the network can handle the additional users. This requires on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2016-03-30 02:18:37
The price won't increase if more people can't use it. Bitcoin's price has always been tied to its utility/usability (the ability for more users to be adopted and make on-chain transactions). The higher that goes, the more the price goes up. The connection here has been well documented.

Blocks are full because new users are trying to use Bitcoin and can't. This has been predicted by steady growth. It's not spam. 
The network is full/filling/average block rising to the maximum cap.

What some non-technical users don't realize is that Bitcoin is way over valued if it doesn't scale on-chain. 
Forcing 2nd layer scaling solutions will highly decrease the USD exchange rate (price) because instead of diverting fees just to miners you now have to pay companies like Blockstream to have a smooth transaction experience.
If on-chain scaling doesn't happen miners will be forced to implement higher fees, taking away one of Bitcoin's main utility benefits: cheap transactions.
Further, once the halving happens miners will be making 50% less from the block reward and they won't have the additional much-needed user fees if the blocksize doesn't increase.
However, if we scale on-chain, the exchange rate to USD would massively increase, users find more utility, miners make more fees per block and new users can come on board.

Right - they tested actual nodes which are throttled to the 1MB limit so people can do other things with their remaining bandwidth. Those settings will obviously be adjusted if the blocksize were to increase. The bandwidth is there to scale.

The network limitations go away if you include header-first mining with this.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:42:40
Exactly. Instead of allowing the community to grow safely core has chosen to continually fight the inevitable switch to larger blocks and more users. More users is exactly what Bitcoin needs to grow (in price and value) for everyone in this community.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:48:47
Oh, so users are allowed to discredit and talk badly about Classic, but not to *promote* it? That sure seems one-sided, don't you think? Not exactly open and fair.
Even so, if you read that anti-promotion statement, it doesn't actually apply to Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classic doesn't attempt to alter anything without that "overwhelming consensus" of 75%. It only activates after that consensus is reached, and if not it will revert to the Core Client. That would exclude it from the clause there entirely. I'm just saying, this seems like a "use any rule to justify moderator behavior" type of thing and it has created massive division in the community.
@_date: 2016-03-16 23:33:43
Question about moderation:
Pro-Bitcoin Classic posts are quickly deleted on this sub, while posts that cast Classic in a negative light are allowed to remain.
Can you explain that?
@_date: 2016-03-30 22:45:01
It's a red-herring scaling ploy. It also is a soft fork that requires 95% - and other not-to-be-mentioned software scaling solutions are already past that. You can test this all you want, but it's probably not going to work/have any scaling impact unless other wallets adopt it.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:39:12
This change actually helps ensures that the network will remain decentralized and keep the network healthy.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:37:42
Uhh, SPV mining decreases orphan rates for miners, how is that "attacking" Bitcoin? 
It's something they already do in China (only they implemented it wrongly). This corrects it.
Please stop being against anything good that Gavin does, just because you disagree with the whole Classic side.
@_date: 2016-03-30 02:35:11
It was a typo. I've corrected.
Some users used to divvy out coins into many individual small-amount blocks for security (as looks like here). That person probably owns the new address and what you're seeing is a consolidation process. 
Maybe they want to buy something or sell their coins? It certainly fills up a block, but it's still not intentional "spam" just for the sake of filling a block.
