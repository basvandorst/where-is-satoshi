Yup. Figured that out Bro. However, I was.....you seemed to have missed that fact which makes it even funnier..

Huh....there’s a joke here about Cougars. I just know it. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:41:22
Gotcha. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:13:09
Amen to that!

I think they're partially correct. It DOES make for a quick and easy intro to Bitcoin. Not necessarily cheap though. It doesn't teach you anything about it, but it gets you another step in the door. You need to have a wallet already created to use the ATM so you'd already have some interest before even getting there. There didn't seem to be a printer for it to print out paper wallets from what I saw. Too risky I would think.

 Not sure about sell. Didn't notice a sell option.

$3000 max transaction limit on this ATM.

Yup. Like I said. This was an experiment to see how it'd go. I'll likely stick to VirWox to keep fees lower, but you can't beat the convenience of it. With VirWox though you have the slop of conversion leftovers sitting on your account as well.

I would assume that a fixed percentage could only work if you had the volume to support it. Bitcoin ATMs could easily be classified into the "early adopter" stage at this point so burden of cost carrying is passed onto said "early adopters" in order to keep it running. Otherwise it just wouldn't be a viable business. I would think that once adoption spreads to more mainstream (i.e. Buying Bitcoin at your local BofA or Wells Fargo ATMs) then you would start so see more of a level playing field as competition for you business sets in. With there being so few providers available at the moment they can effectively charge what they want and claim that's the cost of providing the service.

Out of $100 put in $83.57 landed in the wallet so it was $16.43 in fees. So 16%. But I has Bitcoin! I'll get it back in ROI.

I would assume that one of the main barriers is governmental resistance. Blockchain technology may be great for auditing and tracking, but governments tend to resist having their longstanding fiat currency messed with. 
Look at it from the perspective of Renewable Energy (solar/wind) vs Big Oil. Solar and Wind are great. Most agree. But you can't just plug them in and expect everyone that depends on Big Oil to accept the sudden shrinking of their industry. That's a lot of lost jobs. You have to come up with the solutions for them so that they can see a clear path to future big business without losing anything so that they reduce their objections to solar/wind. 
Bitcoin vs fiat is no different.

I went to the ATM specifically to see what the fees would be.  I knew they'd be high, but I accepted that before I even knew wha they'd be.

San Jose, CA at Valley Fair Mall.

SUPER SIMPLE. 
Walk up.
Touch screen to start. 
Hold phone (with address qr code) up to scan window. 
Insert bills ($100 in my case)
&lt;scoff and laugh about fees&gt;
Press send. 
Walk away. 
Whole process took less than 30 seconds.

I looked at coinatmradar and the "Buy Bitcoin" early access perk in BreadWallet (basically the same thing as coinatmradar. I've been wanting to scope out this particular atm for a while as I'd never had the opportunity to put hands on it when I was there before (wife along and not supportive of bitcoin, LOL). 
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:12:27
Thanks! Every location is out of my way, but I may have to make a pilgrimage to one. :) I like that they post the fees on the site.

I think Coinucopia is the main player here, but I'll check around. There are also a few businesses that do exchanges as well.

Mining it is a TOTAL pain in the ass too. Shitty ROI.

Hold up. Looks like I have an update. Lemme update and try again then I'll report back!!

This is why I'm glad I make it a point to NEVER keep my assets online for longer than it takes to convert or sell it off. I had just moved my last few bits (remainders) off of BTC-e a couple of weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:02:24
False alarm. The new update allows inputting an address. Good drill people. Back to your lives citizens!

This doesn't appear to work on iOS. Tapping the "dl peer" only seems to tell the app to occasionally find another peer to connect to rather than allowing you to specify.
