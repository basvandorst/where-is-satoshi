I find that one of the best ways to learn a language / framework, is to come up with a simple project that I would like to achieve, then start working through it, reading and learning as you go. Why not start by exploring some Python based Bitcoin libraries.... try and import them in to your project.. try generating some public/private key pairs... try interacting with Bitcoin core over RPC to do basic things like look up UTXOs/balances etc. Once you've nailed those sort of basics, you can start looking in to some pure python based blockchain examples.... this will push your knowledge and understanding of the blockchain concept ... take small steps, take your time and try and understand what you're learning, as you go  
You might find these interesting

Sell your Robin Hood holdings and use the proceeds to re-buy Bitcoin from an exchange that allows you to transfer BTC to your own wallet. You can setup your own wallet using your smartphone, PC, or you could even purchase a hardware wallet like a 'Trezor' or a 'Ledger'. The type of wallet you set up usually depends on how much value you are securing, and how readily you need to access it.

I think your answer is way off. Majority of people who support BTC see it as a store of value and a medium of exchange, in equal measure. We also recognise that it's function as a medium of exchange is limited right now due to its rapid growth and adoption. That's why we are developing long term scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. BCH supporters weren't prepared to wait for a sound technical solution to the scaling issue, so they made their own Altcoin, applied a few quick hacks to the code, and decided to scale 'on chain'. This is a very limited term solution and also compromised their security by increasing centralisation. Most BTC holders are holding their funds while the new technical solutions are developed and deployed. Most will probably continue to hold once these solutions are released because they believe in every aspect of BTC: a decentralised, borderless, value storing currency.

i think you underestimate the talent of the developers working on Bitcoin today? ... what could a corporation bring to the mix that we currently lack? ... and if the corporation wasn't prepared to release their source code, then their product isn't competing with Bitcoin. Bitcoins main selling point is that it's open and decentralised with no single point of failure. They'd be competing with other closed systems like VISA etc
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:33
perhaps they come to make a quick profit.. but in my eye, there's no better way to learn about the technology than by having some skin in the game. once these people lose their private keys for the first time, and realise that there is no support telephone number to call, and that they are the true custodians of their own money, light bulbs will start turning on.
anyway, if Bitcoins mission is to become a globally adopted currency, you have to accept the fact that it will be used by all kinds of people, many who don't give a toss about the underlying technology or principles, but who simply want to exchange value using the latest and most functional tech. I don't think these people are a threat to the system

when the internet was just gaining traction in the early days, sending an email as an incredibly complex process. one needed knowledge of compiling C code, the unix operating system, and probably knowledge of the SMTP protocol. Fast forward 10/15 years, and even a young child can send an email, thanks to innovation by companies and services such as Hotmail and Gmail. In the case of Bitcoin, Lightening Labs have released specification on the Lightning Protocol. They have also released source code, demonstrating the protocol in action. You'll see a lot of early adopters on Reddit posting screencasts showing the software in action. They'll also talk about opening and funding channels etc. The idea here is that as the Lighting protocol code/specification trickles outward, more and more Bitcoin related companies will integrate this software into their existing platforms and apps, and they will, hopefully, do so in more and more innovative ways. Much like email back in the early 90's, if you want to use Lightning today, you need to grab the source code, compile it, fund a channel etc etc. But as this stuff trickles down and gains traction, the more popular and cutting edge wallets will begin to support it. The best ones will do so in a way where you hardly even know its happening. Thats why Grandma can send an email today with no knowledge of Unix, C, SMTP.....

WHAT IS TRANSGENDER IDENTITY?
 
This is a situation in which a person does not identify well with his or her physical or genetically determined gender.  For example, a man may identify more as a woman, or vice versa.  Transgender feelings can develop at any age, from very early in life to adulthood.
 
WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF TRANSGENDER FEELINGS OR IDENTITY?
 
According to conventional medicine, causes include trauma, perhaps other childhood experiences, one’s upbringing, or experiences or traumas as an adult.
We believe that the medical and psychological community are missing very important reasons for transgender feelings.  These are:
 
1. Nutrient deficiencies.  From clinical experience, we know that certain nutrient deficiencies can change a person’s secondary sex characteristics.  These are one’s feelings, thoughts and other perceptions about one’s gender identity.  This is essentially the issue with transgenders.
Essential nutrient deficiencies are extremely widespread, but are not recognized by the medical profession.  This is an enormous failing of the medical and psychological professions today, and is quite inexcusable.  It is the equivalent of ignoring an 800-pound gorilla sitting in the middle of your living room. 
 
Congenital nutrient deficiencies. One of the most difficult situations is having a young child with transgender feelings.  What could be the cause?
Nutritional problems today often begin before birth.  If a mother’s body is deficient in zinc, for example, her child will be born deficient in it, as well.  
Such nutrient deficiencies are called congenital, which means present at birth.  It is critical to know about them because many transgenders are young children.  Knowing about congenital nutritional problems allows one to understand why this is occurring.
Causes for nutrient deficiencies.  These include a mineral-depleted food supply, food refining, poor quality diets, weak digestion in most people, toxins in the food and water, and unhealthy lifestyles that stress the body and increase its need for nutrients.  Many articles on this website discuss the consequences of nutrient deficiencies and how to correct them.
 
2. Toxic metals and toxic chemicals.  Everyone is born with both nutrient deficiencies today, but also with excessive amounts of toxic metals and toxic chemicals.  This has been confirmed with medical tests, and we confirm it almost daily using hair mineral tests.
A number of these chemicals affect the hormone levels of the body, and every body system.  For example, some of these toxins specifically mimic hormones in their effects.  They are called hormone-mimetic in their action.
It is not at all unreasonable to imagine that the presence of high levels of toxic metals and nutrient deficiencies could cause a person to experience life differently than others, in terms of their gender preference.
Toxins in the environment is another serious problem that is not recognized or emphasized nearly enough by the medical and psychological professions.  For much more on this topic, please read Toxic Metals and Toxic Chemicals on this site.
 
3. Toxic Chemicals.  Toxic chemicals in the body can interfere with hormone levels, normal sexual development of a child, and can change one’s feelings and thoughts about sexuality.
For example, a very important class of chemicals are calledxenoestrogens.  These are endocrine disrupter chemicals.  This means they interfere with our hormones.  This can cause havoc with our thoughts and feelings about sexuality and gender.
These chemicals are found in food additives, pesticides and other toxic chemicals that are in our air, water and food.  Other chemicals can have the same effects, as well.
 
4. Yin disease.  Many bodies today are too yin in macrobiotic terminology.  This means too cold, expanded and too female in physics terminology.  
For example, a boy or man whose body is too yin, or even one who learns attitudes and ideas that are too yin, will tend to think and feel more like a girl or woman.  
Eating sugar in any form, including fruit, or eating food laced with chemicals or pesticides, can easily cause this condition.
Yin disease is common.  For details, read Yin Disease on this website. 
 
What about genetics?  In our experience, genetics is not a cause of transgender feelings.  The reason we know this is that when a person follows a nutritional balancing program, transgender feeling go away.  This would not occur if the condition were permanent and genetic in origin.
 
May not look or feel “ill”.  People with these imbalances may not appear ill or have any physical symptoms.
In the past, transgender feelings were largely ignored.  This probably harmed some children and adults, who remained confused and “different” from their peers.
Today, there is a move to cater to those with transgender feelings, and to make sure everyone accepts it as fact, and does not discriminate against them in any way.
This is beneficial in some ways, but it is harmful in other ways.  For example, it does not encourage a person to seek deeper answers, such as following a nutritional balancing program to detoxify the body and correct hormonally-related imbalances in the body. 
Sadly, we find that the “transgender movement” is mainly concerned with creating a new group of victims who feel they deserve special treatment, rather than helping people to solve a problem.
I think they confuse those with transgender feelings and lead them into dangerous surgeries and hormone therapies, rather than solve their problem.
 
Serious danger of transgender hormone therapy and surgery.  Please beware that taking hormones to “change one’s gender” is very dangerous.  All hormone therapy tends to increase the incidence of cancer, and perhaps other diseases.
Also, hormone therapy for gender change is not the same as simple hormone replacement therapy.  It is much more unnatural!  Therefore, hormone therapy for gender change is likely to cause even more cancer and other problems.  It does not matter if the hormones are bio-identical.
You are not likely to hear about this danger from the transgender organizations because they would lose all their members if they told the truth about the health risks of hormone therapy and surgery.
Decide that you will love and appreciate yourself just as you are.  Your love of self must not be dependent upon your gender, appearance, likes and dislikes, or any other superficial quality.  You have intrinsic value or worth, and this is the basis for your self love.  Life flows through you, and that is what counts.
If you are different than others, maybe you are setting a new trend.  Give up the idea that there is something wrong with you if you feel different than some others.

The left stoke victim culture &amp; rely on inflating the power and authority of central government.

To quote OP: "In case you aren't aware, that's the process of stopping someone's (incorrect) birth sex hormones (in my case testosterone) and supplying the correct hormones (in my case estrogen and progesterone)."
This is a very dangerous narative and not supported by any evidence. These synthetic hormones have been shown to be considerably toxic and can lead to cancer in the body. Gender is infinitely more complex than we can possibly begin to imagine. The idea that one can 'transition', simply by taking some proprietary pharmaceutical pills is crude and barbaric. I respect OPs freedom to do this, but I will continue to call out this narative of 'transition' as false and misleading.

It's not 'my definition'.... if you type 'define free market' into google you'll see countless examples reiterating the same definition.. Let me help you out:
1. The free market is an economic system based on supply and demand with little or no government control.
2. Definition of free market: Where buyers and sellers can make the deals they wish to make without any interference, except by the forces of demand and supply.
3. In a free market the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, or by other authority.
4. A free market economy is based on supply and demand where prices set freely between seller and consumer, without intervention from the government.

Cheers dude... I was playing around with your config generator just the other evening as it happens.
It'd be great to hear from someone who's using the low bandwidth config .. to get an idea of how that performs in the wild.   
It seems like the 'maxuploadtarget' and 'blocksonly' flags are the critical options as far as limiting bandwidth goes. 
Any thoughts on what's making up the bulk of the outbound/upload traffic? I'm wondering why it couldn't be disabled completely. ... Peer gossip &amp; block relay perhaps? Any ideas if it's possible to disable the relay entirely?

I simply recognise the futility of arguing with weak-minded left wing Reddit trolls.
Just because you're frightened by the idea of having less Government protection, or you simply cannot imagine how a free market might be structured (private arbitration, contracts, etc), does not mean that it isn't possible. More and more private, market based solutions to these problems are emerging, primarily because Government backed efforts lack efficiency and tend towards corruption. If you've been taught that the only way for markets to exist is under the control of a large authoritarian body that violates the non-aggression principle, you've swallowed a doctrine of fear and control. i wish you luck in clarifying your misperceptions.

No... he uses the creation of alts to suggest that the supply of Bitcoin is not limited. This is just plain false and he should be called out for perpetuating bullshit. 
He also makes an argument against Bitcoin based on the notion of 'intrinsic value'. This is another slight of hand. All value is subjective, becoming somewhat objective in the light of open markets.
Further, he suggests that Bitcoin has no secondary use cases. Again, false. Off the top of my head I am reminded of Peter Todds timestamp project. A basic example, but enough to dismantle Schiffs horseshit. 
I welcome his opposition, but he needs to consider his current arguments as thoroughly refuted.  
I want to hear educated, technical criticisms that will force me to reconsider my own position, and to learn more.

i ran LND+Neutrino on a headless pi, running the Lite version of Raspian. Pretty light weight way of doing business without the need to run Bitcoin Core or any other additional software. If you want your node to be long standing, and have a good view of the LN network graph, i'd reccommend against this approach at this time. Running Bitcoin Core and LND on top is probably a more robust solution.

It doesn't do the same thing. A hardware wallet facilitates good cold storage while providing an easy method of actually spending/sending your coins. A paper wallet provides good cold stage, but to spend or send you must sweep the paper wallet into a hot wallet which, by comparrison, is complicated and exposes you to additional risk.

The reason p2p was 'effectively destroyed' is because the presence of BitTorrent forced antiquated business models to die/update themselves. For example, we no longer have high street music stores... instead, we have Spotify and Netflix.... which are so competitve that it no longers makes sense to use BitTorrent..... if Spotify and Netflix hiked their prices, you'd see an immediate resurgence in p2p activity. It has little / nothing to do with Government control / pressure.
@_date: 2019-02-03 12:32:20
No they're not. You can have a distributed blockchain, but blockchains are not distributed by default. A blockchain is simply a data structure, in which blocks of data are chained together by including (usually) a hash of the identifier of the previous block in the header of the current block. It's perfectly possible to create a blockchain on a single isolated machine.
Only once you deploy this blockchain across multiple machines, usually through the use of a p2p network and gossip protocol, does the blockchain become 'distributed'. 
The 'distributed' adjective exists in separation for a reason.

If they're running on seperate machines just make sure your router is set up to forward the respective ports to your internal network. By running them on unique ports they will be seen as individual nodes on the network. If you're running multiple nodes from the same machine[without virtualisation] then there really isn't much point.

They are for chaining together multiple blocks/collections of data in a cryptographically verifiable chronological order.
What are multi-dimensional arrays for?
Here is a blockchain. Notice how it isn't distributed, and yet it is still a blockchain?
` [{'contents': {'block_number': 0,
               'parent_hash': None,
               'transaction': [{'Tom': 10}],

  'hash': '064d0b480b3b92761f31831d30ae9f01954efaa62371b4b44f11465ec22abe93'},

Neutrino is downloading the blockchain, but instead of downloading full blocks, it's downloading what are known as 'Compact Filters'. This is a condensed form of the blockchain that allows Neutrino/LND to function without needing to also run a base Bitcoin node. It's a bit like SPV but with numerous notable differences. As with most light clients, there are security trade offs, but based on what I know,
Compact filter headers are an improvement on the SPV model and a step in the right direction for running Lightnig Network on lesser hardware/lower resource devices.

ahh thanks man. I'm starting to get my head around it. I checked online for the median transaction size in bytes and came up with ~250bytes. I took the desired tx fee of 80sat byte and * by 250 to get 20000. 0.00020000 BTC = £1.40 ,,, that looks about right, doesn't it? I should be able to enter the 0.00020000 figure straight in to core, having done the calculations myself?

You are missing the point. YouTube is a private company, yes, but they claim protections under the law.. by claiming that they are an Open Public Forum. This is the reason they are not prosecuted every time somebody uploads copyrighted material.

As far as I understand (and I could well be wrong), the loop service allows you to send funds from your LN balance, and receive them back on the base Bitcoin blockchain, thus 'completing the loop'.

@_date: 2019-04-28 23:50:38
So download and run the latest release of 'lightning-app': 
Once its up and running, open terminal and run: ps -A | grep "lnd"
This should return the active process of lnd that's running in the background.It will also include the launch parameters. eg:
/Applications/Lightning.app/Contents/Resources/assets/bin/darwin/lnd --bitcoin.active --debuglevel=info --lnddir=/Users/poon/Library/Application Support/lightning-app/lnd --routing.assumechanvalid --historicalsyncinterval=20m --autopilot.private --autopilot.minconfs=0 --autopilot.allocation=0.95 --autopilot.heuristic=externalscore:0.95 --autopilot.heuristic=preferential:0.05 --rpclisten=localhost:10006 --listen=localhost:10016 --restlisten=localhost:8086 --profile=9096 --bitcoin.mainnet --bitcoin.node=neutrino --neutrino.connect=165.227.7.29 --neutrino.connect=dev.conner.money --neutrino.feeurl=
If you navigate to the dir shown above: 
/Applications/Lightning.app/Contents/Resources/assets/bin/darwin 
You'll find the lnd binary there. (it's a build of 0.6.0-beta). Copy the binary to a convenient directory of your choosing.
Once you've done that, launch the binary with the same flags as shown above (you can modify most of the lnd launch params, but make sure to keep the neutrino flags constant):
./lnd --bitcoin.active --debuglevel=info --lnddir=/Users/poon/Library/Application Support/lightning-app/lnd --routing.assumechanvalid --historicalsyncinterval=20m --autopilot.private --autopilot.minconfs=0 --autopilot.allocation=0.95 --autopilot.heuristic=externalscore:0.95 --autopilot.heuristic=preferential:0.05 --rpclisten=localhost:10006 --listen=localhost:10016 --restlisten=localhost:8086 --profile=9096 --bitcoin.mainnet --bitcoin.node=neutrino --neutrino.connect=165.227.7.29 --neutrino.connect=dev.conner.money --neutrino.feeurl=
 
You're done. stand alone lnd 0.6.0 running on mainnet, powered by Neutrino.

The language of 'Network fee' implies a fee that originates or is tied to the network. It would appear that this is not the case. The fee you charge is an arbitrary fee, levied at your companies discretion. This is seriously misleading. By all means charge your fees, but at least be honest and clear about the origin and nature of those fees. I suggest something along the lines of 'BitPay Service Charge'.....

Transactions can be batched, so that 1 base blockchain tx can essentially open many LN channels. Think of users buying BTC from an exchange, and every 5/10 minutes, they broadcast 1 tx to the base blockchain, than opens X amount of LN channels.
I believe it's also possible for existing LN users to introduce more participants to an already opened LN channel. 
I need to do more research on this myself, but it certainly seems that there are more options than just 1 base layer tx per required channel.

The wallet doesn't store the funds. It generates the private keys. With that in mind, it doesn't matter if the wallet software is a full node implementation or not. 
So to answer your question, yes, Electrum is safe for cold storage.
There are a couple of caveats, though.
You said you didn't care about the hardware, however, you should. If your hardware is connected to the internet, it's possible that malware may be able to obtain your private keys. For this reason, it's best to run Electrum on hardware that has not and will not be connected to the internet. 
Also be cautious of very basic / simple hardware setups. Such setups have a much harder time of generating true randomness and as such the security of your private key generation may be comprimised.

It's possible that this will be visible on the blockchain. If Charlie spent all of the WVs funds on BTC, and forwarded them the entire amount, less 5,000, it's possible that the brothers may have picked up on this. If that was the case, it has the potential to be further compounded if those 5,000 BTC were dormant during Shrems stint in prison.

You don't get it, do you. 


 


Don't you see the total contradiction in those two statements?
You're telling the world that what's important is your GENDER, instead of your ABILITY.
Men and women are biologicaly different and make their own free choices. In the countries that have done the most to remove social barriers based on gender and conditioning, the polarisation between men and women INCREASES. It's natural for men to be interested in things, and for women to be interested in people. 
Science and common sense tells us that women are no more disadvantaged than men. They just make different, free choices. For example, men dominate occupations such as engineering, while women dominate occupations such as nursing. THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF FREE CHOICE. Nobody is putting a gun to the heads of young women and telling them not to study engineering. Equally, nobody is telling women not to participate in cryptocurrency. As it turns out, there are just plenty of other things that women find more interesting. Again, this is a consequence of natural, free choice. You should respect women's choices instead of insisting that they conform to your ideas of how the world should be, and that they do as YOU SEE FIT.

I'm genuinely looking forward to this happening. When most people use the internet today, they're doing so without realising that they're operating on the 4th/5th/6th layer of the protocol stack. I hope and expect that the same will be true for Bitcoin in the near future. A great majority of economic activity will take place on the second layer, with most users never being exposed to the base layer. (This will be greatly assisted if exchanges and wallets can bootstrap the channel opening / funding process as an optional part of their internal logic).

Right..... thats my point. 
The point is, there once was a time when you absolutely had to understand what packet routing was. You had to construct packets manually before they were routed. 99% of the population were not equipped to use that system in that form. Good engineering did away with the need to understand the complexities. The same will happen with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:08:43
The developmental approach in Bitcoin is conservative. This means that things like backward compatibility, majoraty consensus etc are of prime importance. This means that, with the information we have right now, yes, your seed will be valid in 100 years. However, we cannot account for unforeseen circumstances at this point in time. Should critical security concerns arise, for example, it may be necessary to fork the network to make architectural changes that some how alter the current public/private key system as we know it. Again, the approach in this circumstance will be conservative, so backward compatibility will be one of the primary considerations. 
The tendancy is conservative, but there are no absolutes.
I would expect that as time goes by, it will become harder and harder to make changes to the base layer. This in itself should further reduce the likelihood that the seed/key systems will change, but unfortunately doesn't rule out encryption algorithms breaking, which seems likely to happen at some stage.
Best advice is to stay alert and read the community updates.

Visit the 1ml link and look for some well connected nodes. When you find one, use the 'connect &lt;pubkey&gt; within LND to connect to it. This should increase peer gossip and hopefully after a short time your view of the network should expand. If not, try opening a few more channels with a well connected node.

It's impossible to tell. 
LN payments happen off chain and are routed peer to peer to peer. This means there is no central point which can be used to measure them. 
It's a bit like asking 'how many packets are being routed around the internet'. 
What you can know, is the number of nodes that are connected to the network (1 node = 1 wallet), and how many payment channels (connections) there are between nodes. 
Google '1ML Lightning Network' for an example of this on testnet.

The average Joe absolutely did have to deal with packet routing.When the internet was in its infancy, all packets had to be constructed manually. Look up 'source routing' for more information. It made the level of technical competency required to use the internet very high. However, as time passed and more engineering progressed, less and less was required of Average Joe, and as a result, the Internet went from something that only nerds could use, to something that the vast majority of us use on a daily basis. Based on the engineering that I have observed happening now within Bitcoin, it's possible that the same trend is underway...  


You're almost correct with this. A blockchain doesn't offer decentralization by default. A blockchain is simply a collection of blocks, each chained together in a way that references the previous block, so as to encode sequence. A centralised company can host a blockchain in a completely centralised manner.  


You don't know anything about me. Why the hostility?

Great answer. That's helped me get a bit of a better understanding. 
So essentially, all the addresses already exist. When you generate a new private key, it will mathematically equate to one of the many existing addresses, essentially providing you access and granting ownership?
I took a quick look at the algorithm used to generate private keys. It seems quite complex (lots of hashing and checkdigits). What I'm curious about now is what aspect of the private key generation aides in maintaining its uniqueness ? from my limited background in programming, I'd guess the inclusion of a time stamp, perhaps, in the early stages of hashing? Any thoughts on this ?

Spend a few days reading some introductory guides, learn the basic terminology, practise setting up and securing a wallet (plenty of tutorials available on how to do this). Dont trade anything for real until you've read a few of the lost coin/hacked wallet threads on here.

\&gt; You are now trying to tell me what the rules of "my game" is.
No. I am simply explaining to you that **your question does not make sense**. In order for one hash to be 'luckier' than another, Bitcoin mining would have to work completly differently to the way that it does. 
YOU NEED TO STOP USING THE WORD 'LUCKIER'. ONE SUCCESSFUL HASH IS NOT LUCKIER THAN ANOTHER. 
ONE HASH MAY BEAT THE DIFFICULTY BY A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE THAN ANOTHER HASH, BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LUCK, SO STOP USING THE WORD LUCK! 
**It's the reason the top voted answer on this thread is not the answer you are looking for.** Because you do not know how to clearly articulate your question.
If you ever feel like understanding why, go back and read any single one of my posts that attempt to help you to understand how one hash cannot be luckier than another. 
# YOU DO NOT GET AROUND THIS BY PROVIDING YOUR OWN DEFINITION OF WHAT 'LUCKY' MEANS. 
\[THATS LIKE SAYING: OUT OF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE. SHOW ME WHO THE TALLEST IS. AND BY TALLEST I MEAN FATTEST.\] 
\- NO! TALLEST MEANS TALLEST. LUCKIEST MEANS LUCKIEST. 
Realise that your question is confused, and try to understand how you could have asked it more clearly.

What are you talking about ???
The macaroon file is essentially encoded text that's sent as part of the API request header to LND. So, when you configure your node endpoint details on your ecommerce platform, you simply include the macaroon file as an additional parameter. It's no more complex than providing the remote node Ip, port, wallet password etc. 
As far as 'configuring which ips are allowed to access the node', this simply isn't the case as far as LND default behaviour is concerned.
In addition, TLS/forced SSL is optional, so the CA cert may or may not be used.
You describe all of the above as 'issues' when in fact they are extremely beneficial security enhancing features.

I do... I'm a slightly more experienced user now, but I still feel the stress and strains of having to be exact, and being fundamentally responsible for my funds. It may be the case that in time, a lot of users would prefer custodial type services, where responsibility may be delegated away, but for now, it's critical in the Bitcoin mission that at its most basic level, soverignty and responsibility start and stop with the end user. 
I have a suspicion that some of these usability concerns will be solved on the second and third layer solutions.

@_date: 2018-12-04 16:24:35
I understand what your asking, but your use of the word 'luck' is just wrong. Notice how you have to redefine the word 'luck' to make your question make sense ? 
You need to stop using that word because it is confusing the question you are trying to ask.
A more appropriate way to phrase your question might be: 'given that the criteria to win is rolling a number less than 10, out of all attempts, which one has succeeded by the greatest margin?'
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:32:34
That depends on the criteria of the game. Let me try and explain why.
If the rules of the game are to roll a number less than 5, this creates a BOOLEAN (TRUE / FALSE) condition: 
IS THE RESULT LESS THAN 5?   
  IF YES, YOU ARE LUCKY.   
  IF NOT, YOU ARE UNLUCKY.
A boolean can only ever be in 1 of 2 states. True, or false. Yes, or no. There is no middle ground, no sliding scale. No degrees of 'lucky'.  (This is how Bitcoin mining works. Is the computed block hash &lt; the difficulty target?).
If Carol rolls a 3, and Bob rolls a 2, they have been EQUALLY lucky because they both satisified the requirments to 'win'. Bob is NOT 'more lucky' because his result was 'even more less than 5'. That criteria does not exist as part of our conditional statement.   
If you want to rank order the individual winning results based on the amount by which they surpass the threshold value, you need to change the rules of the game to something completely different. (E.g. the 3 results closest to 0 will win. In this circumstance, as there are multiple winners, it's possible for one winner to be luckier than another winner. Notice, however, that this criteria isn't applicable in the case of bitcoin, because if you want to create the case where one winner can be luckier than another winner, you have to allow multiple winners. )

Get the latest release of LND from Lightning Labs. It comes with Neutrino built in. Neutrino is a Bitcoin light-client that works by downloading compact filters from supporting full nodes on the network. This means that for every block in the blockchain, you only download a tiny condensed version. Plus, once all compact filters have been downloaded and validated, they no longer need to be stored locally. 
It's probably one of the most optimised and efficient ways of running a Lightning node.
Good luck

as long as you have the concept of a mempool, replace by fee will be possible. it is at the miners discretion which transations they will aggrigate into a block. if two transactions exist that both spend the same input, it makes economic sense that the miner will select the one with the higher tx fee ...

I can only speak from my experience, but there is practically no setup required whatsoever when running lnd... Simply download and unzip the release, and launch the binary with the relevant arguments. Here's my launch script:
`./lnd --bitcoin.active --bitcoin.testnet --bitcoin.node=neutrino --neutrino.connect=`[`btcd0.lightning.engineering`]( `--autopilot.active --autopilot.private --autopilot.minconfs=0 --autopilot.allocation=0.95 --rpclisten=`[`192.168.0.4:10006`]( `--listen=`[`192.168.0.4:10016`]( `--restlisten=`[`192.168.0.4:8086`]( `--alias poonode --profile=9098`
Thats it. If I do the above on a split new box that's never heard of Bitcoin, it will automatically:
\- create and launch a new bitcoin node (neutrino)
\- synch the bitcoin blockchain using compact header filters
\- create and launch a new lnd node on top of neutrino
\- sync the lnd graph
\- find peers, connect, and open a number of LN channels (once I make an on chain funding tx).
Thats it. I can now participate in the LN and all its required on my part is to run the lnd binary with the above launch command, and 1 on chain funding TX.

You're conflating 'lightning network' with 'payment channels'. Payment channels are not synonymous with the Lightning Network. Thats a school boy error.

How much the mined hash beat the difficulty by is how much the mined hash beat the difficulty by. It is not "lucky". It has nothing to do with luck. You can say that by using the word "Lucky" that you mean something else, or you could also say "What is the cheesiest hash ever mined?", "And by cheesey, I mean how much did a mined hash 'beat' the difficulty, relatively speaking". You can keep saying this, but there will never be such a thing as a "cheesey" bitcoin hash. Bitcoin block hashes have nothing to do with cheese, and once a hash has been found, they have nothing more to do with luck.
Hopefully you're beginning to understand ....

It's a completely different way of doing a blockchain. Although recently I've been thinking that it could potentially be done, by creating a side chain (running mimblewimble), and creating a one way conversion where coins could be moved onto the side chain, and never come back to the current chain. Once all coins had come across to the sidechain, the current chain could essentially be deprecated. Extremely unlikely to happen but not beyond the realms of possibility

This part has nothing to to do with 'luck'.
You need to understand what 'lucky' means, then you'll understand why it isn't relevant here. If I have a dice game, where the rule is you must roll less than 5 to win, rolling either 1, 2, 3 or 4 on your first roll are all equally as 'lucky'. They all satisfy the necessary criteria to win.
If it takes you 10 rolls to roll less than 5, then you have been much less 'lucky'. 
'Luck' correlates with the number of attempts required to roll a winning number.
Rolling a 1 with 1 roll is no more 'lucky' than rolling a 3 with 1 roll. 
Rolling a 3 with 1 roll is more lucky than rolling a 7+1 with 2 rolls..... 
Your question should have been 'which block hash has come closest to zero' or 'which block hash is valid by the greatest amount', and you should have left 'luck' out of it.

SSL TLS is optional. I'm making multiple curl requests to an lnd node with just the macaroon and no CA cert. So you can put that notion to bed right away. 
Secondly, you make out like macaroons are some kind of problem or imposition. If you have access to the node to install / configure it, then you have access to the macaroon file. 
If copying its contents to another location is a problem for you, you need to work on your skills as a developer, instead of trying to make out like its a flaw of the system.

You are a relentless little tyrant, aren't you?
My point is that your fundamental question is valid, but the way you are asking it is not. 
You need to abandon the use of the word 'lucky'. 
I have faith that you will eventually begin to understand...
In order for a 3 to be luckier than a 5, the rules of the game must be to get achieve a score as close to zero as possible. This is not how Bitcoin works. In Bitcoin, one must simply beat the difficulty target, therefore one hash is never luckier than another. 
If you want to know which hash has exceeded the target by the greatest amount, ask something like 'which has has exceeded the target by the greatest amount?'. Don't use the word luckier, it is simply incorrect in this context.
Good luck!
