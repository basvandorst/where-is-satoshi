They may use the patents for evil, but until then I think they should get the benefit of the doubt. 
The only way to defend yourself from patent lawsuits is to have your own patents. I suspect that that is why they got all those patents

That is exactly what I'm doing.  I can now hold btc and easily spend money if I want. 
I don't understand why there is so much hate about it.  I wasn't spending coins anywhere before, now I am one step closer.

Mm, well I don't want premium cable and "stealing" the content costs them nothing. So they can give me a way to buy it legally and reasonably or they can live with the fact their content is freely available and people are only paying out of moral obligation.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:43:22




That is more complicated, and I am on the fence. I guess yes, but at the same time, if they choose to be dumb about it, then expect it to be heavily pirated.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:25:54
I do pay for all of those, but still there are some things you can't get.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:49:11
I would pay for shows for shows and things I watch, there just isn't a convenient way to do it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:58:31
So your solution is to buy absurdly expensive dvd's, which I no longer even have a way of playing. or don't watch the show.
Since there is no chance in hell I am buying dvd's or paying for cable. My options are pirate or don't watch. Both of which make them no money. Ergo, my pirating costs them nothing. Further, pirating the show creates hype about the show because more people are watching, which leads to more people watching, both legally and illegally.
So how can you get people to stop pirating? Stop trying to force the same business model. People don't want to pay for 1000's of channels they don't want. Then alleviate the pain points that people have while pirating, namely the downloading and storing process. Look at how successful netflix was, because it delivered content in HD to every platform on demand. 
As for netflix shows that are pirated: There will always be pirated versions of everything, and people will pirate, no matter how easy your content is. A big reason netflix shows are pirated now is that there is no offline version, and there are still ton's of places in the world without good internet. I know at least 2 people who have a netflix subscription but pirate the shows so they can watch them where they don't have solid internet.


Premium cable is a blight on media consumption, and has no place in the future. HBO wizened up to the fact that no one wants it and started HBO Go, which I immediately purchased, because I want to watch game of thrones ASAP. Do you think they would have done that if no one pirated their show? Probably not.
Oh, look at that, profits are affected and suddenly we have a nice surge of innovation to deliver content to people in a form that they want. We are also seeing things like [PS Vue]( which is another step in the right direction.
Since, apparently you are so pro capitalism, piracy wouldn't be an issue worth talking about if premium cable were able to innovate, even a little, on it's own. But it doesn't because it's inherently monopolistic. Piracy has served as the competition cable needed in order to innovate.
The bottom line is, piracy has contributed more to innovation in media consumption than premium cable ever did. Now I can pay for HBO directly, and leave Comcast out of the loop.

there doesn't seem to be a good way to get ROI for bitcoin mining for the average person these days. I've been getting amazing returns in litecoin mining from [LTCGear.com (not exactly bitcoin), $856 (with `anniversary1yr` coupon code and 8% bitcoin payment discount.) I've been making about $130 per week back.](
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:58:57
Im prototyping out a system I am tentatively calling "bitcash". The idea, is that my service would host a bitcoin wallet for you. similar to bitcoin or circle, except, it would send the requested bitcoins to whomever has the account number and access key. 
So the flow goes like this. 
Consumer sends .5 btc to the bitcash service. The service creates a money clip and either gives them the clip number and secret, or associates it with their account. The user can combine or split money clips associated with their account.
The user can print out the clip access code and it's secret key in the form of a qr code, or they can print out a read only code, that only works for checking it's the moneyclips worth. Whoever has that secret key version of the qr code can withdraw all the money out of it willy nilly. 
Once the user has his private money clip and secret money clip codes (printed out or on their phone). They can take it to a coffee shop which accepts bit cash and be able to purchase coffee with the scan of a piece of paper or phone. 
The real power of it is merchant side. The merchant benefits because they enter in the amount to charge and scan the code, bit cash verifies the amount is sendable and instantly responds with a yes or no. They don't have to enter in a request amount, have the person scan that, and then send the proper amount, then wait for the transaction to go through, and most importantly they don't have to deal with confirmations (which just seems scary to non tech savvy people).
The idea is to use it for small purchases (less then $50) worth, like coffee or lunch. 
I could write a lot more about some extra features that I see being useful and arising out of this system, but I think I may get plenty of anger from some bitcoin users about centralizing bitcoin. 
Before you guys get too mad at me, please consider that accepting bitcoin for your average merchant is like playing with gasoline, if they aren't tech savvy it's like adding matchbooks. Adoption is slow for merchants because there is too much to understand and they don't want to try something that they don't understand. Especially something which could cost them a lot of their profits. 
Having a system in place which adds a third party would give them some security and take out some of the scaryness because they would have someone to call when things go wrong, and someone to help make it right etc...
out of time, wish I could write more about my idea, if people are interested in helping, message me with your skillset.
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:57:39
I misspoke earlier because I was out of time to write. I really meant adoption in brick and mortar stores. But I could still be wrong about that. Maybe it's happening faster else where. In my city, there is only 1 place I could find

Coinbase  isn't anonymous for 1. You can't print out a wallet and use it offline for 2. 
Bit pay may be a competitor to worry about, I haven't used their service yet, it's actually on my list of things to check out this weekend

Does what specifically natively? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:01:10
That's why it's bit cash and meant for small purchases. You should only have  small amounts in a money clip. You should be getting receipts, and you could go back to the merchant and contest it with them.
If a money clip is associated with your account, one possible feature would be to allow for a quick two factor authentication. Yes/no pop up on phone

The problem is verifying Alice has the money to send to Bob.
If people are doing things offline, then Alice can spend the same bitcoin dozens if times then get online and transfer the coin to another account.
None of those people would be paid.

Like I said in the post, it's a tip jar, not at a table with a server. 
There is no other way to tip except cash, which means no tip.
Putting a peice of paper in the jar that they could just toss, vs nothing is not the same as leaving a paper wallet instead of a cash tip at a table where tips are essentially required.

I agree wealth and currency are not the same, which is why it's not a good comparison.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:30:20
That comparison doesn't make sense.
Boa isn't generating currency, earning it I guess. Getting money from the fed? Why does it matter.
The comparison about power shows that mining isn't any more detrimental, in terms of power usage, then banks are, and have been for a long time.

If we're loosening the definition, than you shouldn't claim people saying it's backed by math are wrong.
It's backed by math because math prices that I have it and may generates it. People just keep track of how much other people have, and that is also done using math.

Places that accept bitcoin in California aren't usually too pushy about it. 
Phili has a reasonable amount of places that accept bitcoin. 
The more it grows, the easier it will be to trade with it. So if you are in a position to start accepting bitcoin, or know someone who is, bring it up and do some research. The worst that can happen is you attract some bitcoin enthusiasts to spend money at your spot. 
Every bitcoin transaction I have done has been a pleasure, and I never have to worry about credit card theft etc.... 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:23:39
Define legitimate advertiser. You can't.
And the only way you can control what's you think is legit is through and ad blocker.
And you're confusing the concepts.
Most malware is spread by visiting websites which serve malicious ads without their knowledge. As apposed to opening emails etc... So sites that are "legit" can serve malware. Happened to MSN (I think, might have been a different huge site) not to long ago.
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:45:44
You don't need too, you can transfer bitcoin from anyone to anyone, just like cash, the catch is, they have to be willing to trade in bitcoin. 
For all intents and purposes, bitcoin is just like cash, except digital. You couldn't go into a store and buy eggs with euros (in the united states) just like you can't go in and buy eggs with bitcoin, until the store decides they are willing to trade you eggs for bitcoin.

coinbase is 1%, so it would be 334.2191, but yea, depends on the discount, obviously 20% would be worth it, but would 2%? probably not, not for the average person anyways. 
It's unrealistic to expect deep 20% discounts on everything.

That is a tired answer, and not really relevant.

Depends on what they want. A lot can be retrieved by Apple by adding a fake device associated with their account. The fake device would have access to a lot of info, happily encrypted for it by the locked down device. 
Wouldn't work for devices which the need unlocked,  but if they did it ahead of time,  the user would innocently unlock their device and send all the info to the shadow device. 
Hopefully Apple never does this. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:38:27
It doesn't seem to me that there is any reasonable arguments left against increasing it, most of the debate seems to be about how much to increase it, maybe I am wrong?
The part of this solution that I like is that the size is variable, getting bigger when it needs too, and smaller when it can.
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:20:16
Don't get me wrong, I agree 100%. I'm just trying to explain why they think there is a difference

I agree with everything except the documentation part. Documenting things is very necessary. I publish a lot of open source as well, and not writing documentation is asking for frustrated people. If I don't care enough to document it, I don't publish it.

OK, I see, maybe I am confused about the problem then.
Can you explain or point to a reference for the role a maximum? I guess to prevent someone from making a block with all the transactions in it? It seems like all transactions need to make it on the chain eventually, why limit the size of a block?
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:44:58
Lol, sure, and bitcoin will be the global economy.
Open bazaar is a promising project, but don't expect it to overtake amazon that easily. It's mostly going to be used by bit coin enthusiasts for quite a while.

It's too bad it costs money to buy into bitcoin.... Usually negates the discount.
