It's crossed back and forth over $9k so many times over the last two years I've lost count.

You can trade bitcoin futures on the CBOE. Doesn't sound all that different from what you're trying to do.

This would mean the USD is backed by gold... so people would just use USD again because USD is a representation of gold. The USD could also be backed by bitcoin theoretically.

This is a separate issue than the gold standard, and is a problem with allowing fractional reserves. The problem would be the same if USD was backed by bitcoin. In fact, it is a problem you already see with centralized exchanges.

No clue. I suppose an independent audit would be the way. I don't know how they did it when USD used to be backed by gold. Obviously bitcoin is superior in that regard.
I would never just take the feds at their word though. The fed should be audited right now anyway.

I think you are so very confused and you need to educate yourself better on the fundamentals of how bitcoin works at a technical level. But to give you a head start, I'll explain a bit.
* Whether there are 3 miners or 300,000 miners, a block will be mined on average every 10 minutes. 
* Whether there is 1 transaction or 100,000 transactions being sent across the wire, a block will be mined on average every 10 minutes.
You should google "Bitcoin difficulty adjustment" - it is the algorithm that adjusts how difficult it is to mine a block.
It is not correct to believe that more miners = faster transactions.
And even your understanding of transaction fees is backwards.


It's actually the opposite, lol. Since a block is mined every 10 minutes, there is a finite number of transactions that can fit in this block. So the more transactions there are, the higher the fees, because people are competing to get their transaction included in the block.
I'm not sure how you came to those conclusions. If someone told you that is how bitcoin works, they are misinformed themselves.

I'm not sure what you are responding to. The information you put forward in your previous replies was simply inaccurate.

That doesn't make sense.
