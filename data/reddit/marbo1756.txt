What happens if you short bitcoin? Do you have to pay taxes everytime you sell for fiat?

Username checks out. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:30:51
When are we not? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:17:21
Why not bitcoin cash core? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:26:18
Everyone of us was a newbie once

One one hand you want to increase blocksize for faster adoption on the other hand you say bitcoin isn't ready for the surge in interest thats happening right now. By increasing the blocksize you just push the problem further into the future. By keeping the current blocksize you increase the pressure to develop real solutions

Just check the price like an addict every hour or so :D

Bitcoin cash is on a good run right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:16:06
with blockfolio it works. I don't know about bitcoin ticker though
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:33:43
I have no idea but I don't think it will last long. That's why I sold everything a few minutes ago to purchase more of that sweet bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:32:09
Blockfolio and bitcoin ticker widget are good
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:43:38
If it goes to 250k then you wont have to sell it for fiat. At that time I guess you can pay everywhere with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:36:31
Or... A crash of ~50% minimum
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:38:56
So you are waiting since 2013? You could have bought back then.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:51:51
Stupid advise. If everyone sells exept for a small group of people and nobody comes back in and buys again the minority that bought is fucked
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:11:31
That comment shows that you have no fucking idea about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:22:37
Then don't comment and just ignore it!? He didn't ask YOU in particular
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:24:09
Aaaaaand it's down again 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:17:57
What the fuck do you want from me? xD
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:23:31
Nice thank you
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:28:12
Nobody cares about tai Lopez lol
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:17:51
Why so you think so? Because of the forks? I think it will rise because everyone will sell the forked coins for more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:46:16
Yeah but it's always good to have a Bitcoin sale to buy more of this sweet currency
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:58:22
Where do you live?
