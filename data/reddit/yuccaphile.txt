Diamonds have value, they're also a scam. As a currency it has use and value, but you know darn well people, especially around here, treat it as an infallible super-investment.
Just because I don't see things the way you do doesn't make me blind. That's a bit harsh. I am incredibly skeptical of absolutely everything, and the less transparent something is, the more I question it. I'm not a luddite. 
I mean, a country with a GDP of Texas just stole a presidential election and has changed the tone of the entire country. I didn't find it hard to believe that a group of people could manipulate wealth with the same efficacy, and crypto seems like a right brilliant way to do it. (My opinion on the matter does not reside solely on conspiracy theory, however.)

That's what I've been saying.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:46:40
Whatever. Spend your money however you'd like. But the fact that all you cryptoheads keep trying to get every one you know to buy into this stuff, thereby increasing the value of your own investment, reeks of Ponzi or pyramid nonsense.
Good luck. You'll need it.

They can also buy a lottery ticket, which is a scam that preys on poor people.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:03:48
I don't think you know what those words mean.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:23:24
It is a scam. Luckily, now it's too expensive for poor people to buy into.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:58:20
You think nobody is being scammed with bitcoin? Is this something you've looked into?
Edit: I addressed my own failure in terminology in one of the many, many replies to others in this thread. "To expensive" was a poor translation of my thoughts.

I can see what you're trying to do, and I'll respectfully refuse to play your little games. Others here are capable of holding a conversation and offer points that are worthy of consideration.
If you actually have something to say, you should take singe cues from them. You'll get farther in life by trying to express yourself coherently than by belittling others.

And it's failed massively every single time, given enough time. You know, depression, recessions, bubble bursts, etc etc.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:01:43
And some people are so blinded by dollar signs they can't see the forest from the trees.
It's not like there's never been a system set up to intentionally victimize people, right? Yeah, people are so honest when it comes to money.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:11:59
Wow. Good point. I must have some repressed memories of being beaten with a flash drive when I was a child. It's all coming back now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:40:17
Whatever you'd like, sir.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:14:13
Really? So, since you have no way of forming your own argument, you resort to attempting to discredit anyone that disagrees with you? That's some high-level stuff. Really whitty. It's a great example of people saying things.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:50:25
I agree. Less of a scam, still is one. Just another way for the rich to redistribute wealth to themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:26:56
I agree it was a shotty representation of the point I was trying to make. What I was trying to highlight was the distance between the floor, the current value, and the ceiling. If you put $100 into BTC now, and the value fell to a few dollars a coin, where would you be at? For a similar percentage of return instead of loss, how high would it have to climb? Do you think, honestly, that the chances of BTC being worth tens of millions of dollars a coin is comparable to the chances of them being worth pennies a coin?
The rich have been manipulating currency for ages, how is this to be any different?
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:56
Why wouldn't I enjoy a cheeseburger? How does that make me a dumbass? 
But no, you're right, it's a totally infallible system and nothing will ever go wrong. It's a safe bet. A sure thing. Only the smartest, best people will invest in it. 
And the fact that you resort to ad hominem attacks surely means you're right, and smart, and the best type of person. Well done.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:40:47
There's regulation with stocks and such. Who regulates crypto? What keeps the next technological leap from making it obsolete, or worse, susceptible to attack? I understand the a little more than the basics of how it works, but I don't underestimate people's ability to innovate.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:02:20
What a well put together reply. How do people ensure that they aren't being scammed when buying BTC? Or are all the allegations just scare tactics?
People like yourself who offer actual information on this topic are actually helpful, as opposed to the "lol, what an idiot" trolls. 
People are being scammed, enough to draw attention from governments. You can say it's because people are uninformed, but if you need a degree in computer science to understand and safely purchase bitcoin, it is doomed (in my humble opinion).

I thought reliance on deflationary currency was part at fault for the great depression? I'll admit that economics isn't my strong suit, and at a global level, it's downright confusing and foreign. 
I can see it being an alternate currency, especially for large, under the table cash transfers. But so many people view it as an investment, as a way to get rich, as something to put their nest egg into. 
It's not as if I look down on people for taking part and having faith and trying to grow their wealth through whatever means they choose. I'm just not sold on the fact that a decade old tech was created altruistically and without the possibility of exploitation at a time when technology is advancing quicker than any individual can keep track of.
Okay, maybe I am a bit old fashioned.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:46:10
Good job, get the poor people to buy your bs so it will go up in value so those that hold the most coin can cash out and crash the market. Brilliant strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:27:58
Just look through the thread, man, not just my replies to your inane comments.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:43:10
What a wonderful argument you put forth. Go ahead, throw all your money at an unregulated system with no intrinsic value. I'm sure it will work out for you.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:39:54
I understand that doubting technology is a bad idea, but I'm not the only one here who is doing so.
I can see that your homophobia is clouding your mind. It's been that way for thousands of years. I'd rather be stupid than ignorant. I may not ever be rich, but at least my ability to accept people will allow me a happier life than you'll ever find.
Keep chasing the almighty dollar. I'm sure it will work out for you.

The market is easily manipulated by those with wealth/power to benefit themselves at the expense of lower-level "investors."
Don't think that just because it is possible to profit that it is not a scam. At best, it's gambling, which is kind of a scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:49:28
Bitter? Missed it?
So you agree that it's a missed opportunity as of now? And yet you still think people should invest in it? 
No, I don't regret not putting my money into something that, at the time, I knew nothing about and had no access to. Even a couple years ago, when I knew about it, I do not regret my decision to spend my money as I did. It's a novelty. I'm not upset that my closet isn't full of Beanie Babies, either.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:17:16
That's the most put together response any of you key-beaters has been able to put forward, so good for you. I appreciate the fact that you took the time to say something that has some value to it.
The way you make it sound, BTC is a tool that can be used. No arguments there.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:06:02
A poor person wouldn't be very enticed to buy 1/6000th of anything, really. 
I could say real estate is too extensive for the poor to invest in, what would you say? They can buy a square inch of land for $20? They're poor, not stupid.
You might be able to sell them on penny stocks, an affordable investment (and a scam). So you could sell them penny-cryptos if you tried, that might make sense to them. But to convince them that buying a fractional amount of something with no intrinsic value? I think most would rather buy a cheeseburger, at least that way they get to eat.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:52:48
Boy, who ever thought a multibillionaire would fuck around with y'alls Monopoly money. I mean, having a record of where every fractional bit is sent couldn't ever be a bad thing....
(Goes back to stuffing $20's under his mattress.)
