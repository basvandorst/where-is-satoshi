"Bitcoin is what's called a "cryptocurrency," and is "mined" on a worldwide network of personal computers using a highly sophisticated algorithm. The flaw in the code linked to these recent attacks is called "transaction malleability." Users can exploit the flaw to make it appear that a Bitcoin transaction never took place. Hackers reportedly took advantage of this vulnerability to empty the recently revived Silk Road site’s escrow account. Alternatively, transaction malleability can be exploited by hackers to launch denial of service attacks of the kind that prompted the freeze on withdrawals from the three Bitcoin exchanges."
"Transaction malleability was a known issue with the Bitcoin software, one that was identified several years ago. When the Mt. Gox story broke, Andresen claimed in another blog post that, while transaction malleability was involved, "The issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox’s implementation of their highly customized wallet software ... and their unpreparedness for transaction malleability." In other words, it was Mt. Gox's fault, not Bitcoin's. But when the Bitstamp and BTC-e story broke the next day, Andresen quickly backtracked"
Tell me again how Bitcoin isn't to blame here?

Wasn't the problem with the Bitcoin protocol itself?  I mean, I thought the whole reason the TX Mallebility issue was discovered was because of Mt. Gox.  If it was, then he's not lying...
