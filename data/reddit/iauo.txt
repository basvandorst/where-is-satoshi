A lot of people argue that its usability as currency is actually one of the intrinsic values of gold. It's rare enough, can be easily melted over fire and made into coins, it can be split (due to its relative softness), doesn't corrode and has a unique color.

That does not at all tackle the problem this thread is about though..

Can you go into detail on how you think that would work?

Replaced in what way? Bitcoin has no applications, so what is there to "replace" with a different coin?

A fixed-amount currency such as BTC (even current BTC as we have no direct means to regulate its amount) used in a growing economy would rise in value over time (deflation), discouraging spending ("goods will be cheaper if I buy tomorrow") which in turn slows down the economy until it eventually comes to a grinding halt. Google "why do we print money" or read [this]( (for example chapter 3.2.3) on why it's important for an economy to have direct means to control the amount of money in circulation.

Look at the title of the thread you're posting in. This is why your "breaking down a currency into smaller units" has nothing to do with the problems this thread is about.

I think you just don‘t understand the problem tbh.

That doesn't change the amount of money in circulation whatsoever, just like declaring $10USD to now be called 1 dillydollar consisting of 100 doodlycents doesn't magically create the inflation the economy needs to survive.
