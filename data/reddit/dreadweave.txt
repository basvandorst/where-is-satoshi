I dont understand the picture. you say we are starting the 5th but in the Image it looks like the 5th is Ending. there are 5 Orange bubbles already.
Does this mean the bubble is over or are we starting the 6th?

Man you have a Monero Miner on your site. Bad play,

It looks like it Might. All signs point to a retracement to at least $3600 and if that doesnt hold then down too $3200
You can pump as much Hype as you like but you need to realize that the majority of the market doesnt come into this sub or even onto reddit at all.
edit : remember we were below $2000 only 8 weeks ago.

Is this whole article based off one tweet??
We were denouncing the FUD tweet. But were happy all get back on board because of a different tweet? I see no announcements yet from any Chinese officials or chinese articles can someone please point me in the right direction?
The Linked article actually concludes with "What do you think about the recent events in China? Do you think Chinese exchanges will be shut down? Let us know in the comments below."
It is making no statements about if a ban will happen.

Wait what?  your friend brought Ant miners and doest now how to set up a wallet?
Something is terribly wrong here. He needs to start watching you tube guides to Bitcoin mining NOW.
Its not too late he can still be profitable he just needs to make sure he doesn have any questions. If you are buying Ant miners you should be at the point where you dont have any questions like the ones your asking.
You need to know exactly what you are doing and not just throwing money at the wall.
