Don't forget btcmarkets.com for Australians.

I feel like this is a bamboozle but if not, 0.5 would be more than enough (° ͜ʖ °) 
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:44:22
What country?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:11:10
I agree with your post, but I think it's a shitty post. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:04:30
But do you support garlicoin?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:14:17
Pretty sure you can't cancel transfers, will just take ages to go through.

When I posted this about 3 weeks ago I got told to shut up lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:52:02
Sorry, I don't know anything about UK exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:59:07
Woo? Why Brisbane tho.

I would edit it if the link to edit it did anything other than open the same page in a new browser tab. If you don't like this post, just hide it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:07
btcmarkets right now but was Coinbase at one point. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:22:20
Do it then.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:10:00
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:23
Do you have any more info on that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:38:22
It sure does
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:39:12
These gains tho
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:27:17
I originally found out about this sub from the 9000 meme that hit the top of r/all. That inspired me to find out more about bitcoin and now I'm hooked!

Haha yes I own 1 dogecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:01
Wish we could get that in Australia. $50 will get you 10gb at most. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:54:35
Australian but some would say that ours are more free ��
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:37:26
I bought $5 worth a couple weeks ago, I think you need to find a new exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:45:27
Bcash is actually a good name though
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:56
I'm just going off of Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:45:06
Damn, it needs ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:36:40
Wow that's pretty cool
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:12:21
It's in the sidebar I think
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:04
Fuck yea
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:10:05
I would If I could afford a passport
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:16:25
Cool. Thanks. Will I need to do the 'send in pic of ID' thing
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:38:54
Yea no
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:56:07
It would help ease congestion a **bit** but the price would drop quite a bit if no one bought it. Besides, segwit should be a thing soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:11:32
Unfortunately can't get unlimited plans in Australia. That would allow people to get decent internet and we can't have that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:22:45
Which exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:52
Coinbase still says 20.5
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:41:17
I am confident with working with setups on my server, I just want to know what to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:38:40
They do if each bag costs $15,000 and will most likely rise in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:12:29
That's what they all say
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:45:39


What do you mean by this? Are you aware that you don't actually have to buy a full bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:44:12
For me it says that I need another form of ID like most other sites. Luckily btcmarkets (Australian) uses an ID system that links to the government systems so I just need a name and license. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:10:35
Already $20k! ^In ^Australia
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:01:00
Bit hard to send 30c of bitcoin right now
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:36:20
That's what I mean, waiting for it to be more widespread and used more often. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:07:50
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:37:27
I'm pretty new and I've found Jaxx to be a good wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:07:29
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:00:56
No one will answer as it is common practise to keep the amount you have a secret. As for me, not enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:17:22
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:12:03
I asked this a week ago and got no answer so I'm interested in this too. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:37:47
I'm not in charge of the FAQ
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:01:06
Yea pretty much. I would be interested to see how well this works. You would get plenty of customers/users and you can charge your phone/wifi thing for free but I'm still not sure if you would break even on the internet cost. Further experimentation is needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:59:36
Just go to btcmarkets and look at the price. $19/bit!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:37:13
I didn't get it transferred from the exchange, waiting for it to use segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:37:29
I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:38:05
If you go to any big exchange and look at the buy orders you'll see some pretty big numbers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:18
At 19k AUD..
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:45:01
Ok thanks. I was just unsure as to why Coinbase says that it's still pending. Good to know that it hasn't just gone missing. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:37:12
Is that a reference to something?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:15:08
It won't affect the prices?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:55
Just buy the bitcoin and leave it in the exchange until fees have died down
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:03:43
It's slowly being adopted
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:29:41
I just thought that having extra restrictions set by isp's might lower the value a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:39:03
How will the absence of net neutrality affect bitcoin? Because let's be honest, there's a fair chance it will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:05:18
I did buy some eth when I originally bought my bitcoin. Still waiting to break even. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:07:15
All good :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:40:49
I think that we should use a 'bit' as a standard form of measurement which would bring the price down to around $20. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:44:32
It should be yes
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:27:24
I think that there should be a full section in the FAQ explaining it
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:37:37
MS Paint really is the best way to advertise
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:07:08
How small a bit do you want?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:24:28
Only profitable if you get lots of people doing it
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:34:36
Yes I must have meant mBTC. In my currency that's ~$20. Thanks for clarifying that. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:43:30
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:16:51
Coinbase only needs 1 form of ID
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:15:46
So I just look up gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:58:33
It depends what country you're in. I know that in Australia you need 2 forms of ID to use GDAX which is the only thing stopping me from being able to use it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:51:07
Actually I just looked it up. They have the most retarded ID requirements, they want 2 forms. I had to use my father's drivers license just to use coinbase, he doesn't have a passport as well. How do they expect to get new customers if they want both of those?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:43:43
All the localbitcoin offers I found (from a quick look) were too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:01:29
Ok I might try that if I can't convince my dad. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:59:09
Localbitcoins isn't an option as there is nothing near me and not much in small amounts anyway. I've been trying to tell him that this isn't some dodgy thing that some people to, that this is actually a huge worldwide thing but he's a bit slow. I'm going to go for another big push tonight.
