Proof proof proof I need to see evidence.
Let me try open an account at all of those and get back to you.
I’ve been waiting for 6 months for bitfinex, gdax and several local bitcoin dealers.
How does one in australia get more than $1,000 into crypto land without paying 35% fees via papal $130usd at a time was a key part of the question I hadn’t given context to

whats teh big fucking deal.
Anything changing its auditors is a red flag.
Just do a google search and open your eyes, or you will be taken down like superman from cryptonite
Except replace cryptonight with automated bitcoin pyramid ponzi.
And you thought i was crazy for watching every episode of doomsday preppers before and after the delayed y2k bug aka satoshi scam

SOMETHGINGS FUCKING GOING ON AND TETHER , BITFINEX AND PROBABLY CRYPTO NICK (unconfirmed) ARE INVOLVED

they probably have to report large transactions over a certain amount and get clearance as per new AML laws (if they are complying) so just hope you aint on any sneaky panama lists and the IRS and FBI will let you walk away with yo cash.  Be more worried about your residency (for tax purposes) than losing your money if they are regulated in the USA.
Unless they are a general collateral pool (pretty sure they are) and they are using leverage and using customer deposits to fund their own bets then yeah you could lose your money but then everyones fucked because they seem the most legit.
GDAX have a large institituional following from bigmoney HFT wallstreet (but they will be out / short the minute the trend turns and spoofy maxes out his tether margin)
Coinbase could be too big to fail like the banks where because crypto is / was $600b market cap and they only paid (a fraction of that) but you dont wait for that or rely on that you buy when that is looking possiblyt and everyones capitulated (front page news -blood oin the streets style)
You gotta jump through more hoops to open an account at these places than you do to get a mortgage

You have to withdraw $1,000 tether in cold hard cash from your account as proof before the conditions of the smart contract will complete.
And provide evidence
