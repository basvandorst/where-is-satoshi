Can any one ELI5... I am superconfused..

thank you kind person, this was awesome... so if i understand correctly the segwit proposal was to increase the block size am i right? and not all exchanges around the world support this yet.. and by the time they do they will be spending a lot on upgrading the infrastructure... by infrastructure i mean improving whatever software is used to communicate with a the network using large blocks of transactions. so instead they just dont do it and take a large sum in profit for processing the transaction. and this will indirectly result in less usage of bitcoin over the period of time.

Eli5 how is bitcoin non inflating?

How do they even predict? It all seems random to me.

Eli5 what is lightning network and how to do transactions with it.

The whole purpose of bitcoin is to not get regulated.

thanx for the reply. 
* correct me if i am wrong, i (as in my client) have set the target to say 7 and i compute the hash which is below this target and pass it on to the network. 
* then say X is the guy(client) who has its target set to say 5. 
but my hash is not below the target specified by X. then my hash value will be discarded from the network. 
* but if it is below the target set by X then i will be again forwarded in the network.
* if the hash generated is satisfying all the target set by all the clients in the network it will be accepted by the network.
and can you tell me what this means, i am referring to the [wiki](
(difficulty) (It) is recalculated every 2016 blocks to a value such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been generated in exactly two weeks had everyone been mining at it
"There is no special individual in the Bitcoin network."
lol, sorry i sometimes refer computer/app/module as that special individual.

sorry my mistake i asked a wrong question. i should have asked how the miner will get rewarded after they mine that 20999999.97690000 BTC... anyways... so in future transaction fees will be passed on as block rewards...
i am simply impressed... until now i was just reading the wiki articles in bits and pieces. but never managed to get the depth of the whole picture. and i am sure whatever i have managed to understand from this post is like a speck of fine dust particle... i really appreciate the people/person who have worked behind this whole thing. they have really thought DEEEEEEEP... just looking at the source code have blown up my mind...

so by your example, if the target is narrow then the time you required is more to pick out the card which is less then the target.
so who sets this target value? 
currently it is 
but who decides that this is the target!... is it decided by all the people participating in mining or by an individual who is going to calculate the hash?

so what will happen when the last block will get generated.... i think the transactions will still go on. but new bitcoins wont be generated. but then what about the miners? how will they be in the picture?

my thoughts were just random assumptions.. i never thought in depth that it would eventually lead to forking. and that just blew my mind... also as per the chart its like self regulating... i just had a quick glance on my cellphone.. did not get time to really look into it. i really appreciate your help :)
