As this becomes more widely adopted the small price change incriminates become less strange. Jumps in terms of small denominations are less important. A larger adjustment of 5 to say 20 dollars is the equivalent of 5 to 20 cents a few years ago. Also try and just look at scale. We went from 50 to 1200 usd (yes I know drop and gox) in a short time. Compare the two. Current and the mtgox explosion is small in comparison to this.

The real moral of the story bitcoin crashes up. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:03:37
That isn't my question. It's gonna rebound. But why the panic.

As somebody that has been following him since his drone enthusiast years (quads) to his bitcoin years, I love the idea. Will it happen I hope. Great man.

I am a big fan of Simon Sinek. Watch the entire video. It's a great motivator / tool if you work in sales.

I picked this up tonight while I was at the supermarket. I was super surprised and happy to see it.  
After reading some of the comments. I think this helps with adoption. legitimacy has always been an issue for bitcoin.

My personal opinion yes it is much better than gold. Bitcoin is more than an intrinsic value of data. It's really the only option (or something similar) for a world currency. It offers value like other currency's. But most of all it offers forced trust Between two parties that is backed by one of the strongest networks in the world. Just my 2c!

As somebody who figured out Bitcoin in 2011 and held. I'm happy. All I'm saying is out of all my investments this has been the most exciting and worthy of investment, I'm a hodler.

Coinbase I have yet to have one issue with. And when my wife contacted there customer support for an issue she had, It was resolved in 2 days. I have had issues with eBay or Amazon that have taken longer

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:54:47
I'll spend less btc building an Evo:)

I am not in a panic. I'm just wondering what makes the market or any market fluctuate like this.
