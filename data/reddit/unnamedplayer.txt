It may be a bit too basic a question but as someone who has been sitting on the sidelines trying to figure out the basics before jumping in, can you recommend a good source to learn about the best practices? Things like hardware wallet and why are they better? What are the options when it comes to getting one etc.

Good info. I just went through the links on the official page on wallets on the BitCoin site and feel like I am better informed than I was before. Ledge Nano S seems to be on pre-order for now, with the next batch scheduled around the end of March :/
Just a question, till I get a hardware wallet, does an offline wallet setup with something like Electrum on an offline system for signing and an online one for transaction give a good enough security or is it more like just a couple of steps removed from a pure online wallet? (I may have misunderstood some of the details of the setup so you will have to excuse my limited knowledge on the subject if that's the case)

Ah no.. not investing practices in general. I won't be investing more than what I can afford to lose. I meant investing in the crypto-market. Things I should know about, the most basics of steps I need to know to get started, how to handle the security etc. 
I did some more reading on the topic after the last post and I think I am getting the hang of it. I think I will go with a two step offline authentication system till I can get a good hardware wallet. Will do some more digging around and then take the plunge in a few days.

And now I am sitting alone in the room, laughing like a madman. All thanks to your post.
