Price of Berkshire Hathaway stocks depends on how successful the company manages its stakes in other companies.
Warren Buffet during many years has been proving that he can outperform the market. So many investors believe that Buffet can provide better returns for them, then if they invest by themselves. So they invest in Berkshire. That's why the company has such a great cap. Simply it provides better returns than the market for many years and has significant share in other companies, which provide utility value (like AmEx, IBM, Apple, etc.)

It's a conservative assumption, that 10% of IT and financial services will be improved with the help of blockchain technology and will depend on blockchain in the future.
$31 trillion is stock market value of companies from IT and financial sectors.

Well, I do believe in this assumption. Here is why.
If there is such a large demand for Apple products and people pay that much money for Apple products, than it means that society sees that much of utility value in Apple and consumes it. This translates into enormous cashflows for Apple, which translates in a giant capitalization of Apple.
Need to mention that Apple has a lot of loyal fans, that fact can have some asymmetrical effect. But, in general, I believe that such approach is possible.

It's based on assumption that the value of companies represents the utility value of services and goods, provided by those companies to society. //possible approach to valuation
This value is approximately equal to the total stock market capitalization
The article estimates which part of utility value, provided by companies, can be substituted by utility value, provided by blockchain platforms.

Right, if the technology is new and its market is immature, it's highly probable that the stock market doesn't correctly reflect the true value of companies, which provide services utilizing the new technology. That happenned in early 2000s with internet industry. But for mature markets it's correct I believe.
**Quotation:** *The purpose of this article is to look into the future and speculate on the potential value of cryptocurrency market once it matures, in other words, make a prediction of how big the demand for blockchain technology will be in, say, 5-10 years.*
