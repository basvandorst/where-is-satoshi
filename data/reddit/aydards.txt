Foreign speaking governments casually colluding to ban random technologies / computer code....  yeah like that would happen

I lost 80 btc on sat dice, life goes on and more love is to be found

It's a hard figure to estimate but I would say 100,000 committed bitcoiners with millions of feet dippers and billions who have heard of it.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:57:43
could coinbase be having liquidity issues?
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:59:24
It's the upper bound, it's still relevant

Proof of existence works by hasing your data and injecting the hash into a transaction, it doesn't put the whole data just a digital signature

Try it uses a seed so your entire house can burn down but your coins will be safe with the 13 word seed

Storing a paychecks worth of value in bitcoin is no problem and if everyone in the entire world did it, things would get interesting

Because of the chance that everybody else also wants to put their chips into the big pot

Yes many of those americans can afford it they just don't spend their money as wisely as they could. 
Not to say their bills aren't extreme but many people waste hundreds on phone bills each month so don't act like the money isn't there

The seed should be written down in multiple places before funds are even sent to the wallet!
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:47:41
It's never nighttime in bitcoin land
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:27:25
If you want the easiest and safest then just generate an electrum seed on an offline computer and delete the wallet file after you have regenerated it a few times from the seed to check it always gets back the same addresses.
Transfer the MPK from the offline comp to the online one to watch your balances.
Go on the electrum.org website and read their tutorials.

This is not how it works, you SEND the bitcoins from coinbase to a new public key on the trevor which will be controlled by a private key that only your trezor knows.
Plus its impossible that coinbase would ever give you the private key where the coins currently are, they will send it to your own address however.

Think about it, if craig had only a few degrees before the attention, and now seemingly has 75 as per his ridiculous online posts, doesn't that seem like he is making himself seem crazy to distract away from something?

Change the time period to 7 days and select bitfinex, it topped at 5920.

The bitcoin CEO told us no more price posts between the $1000 milestones
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:39:33
Yeh exactly. It's possible but with Japan's massive retail acceptance, their governmental approval and now the CBOE looking to make a bitcoin derivative product, higher prices are the most likely scenario.

At a price of US$1,250 per troy ounce, reached on 16 August 2017, one tonne of gold has a value of approximately US$40.2 million. The total value of all gold ever mined would exceed US$7.5 trillion at that valuation and using WGC 2017 estimates.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:26:50
It went to $1000 then stayed below that for a few years so easily possible for it to happen again.

There have been a few [demonstrations]( however the GUIs and bugs are still getting worked out.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:46:10
**Try not** ever import private keys into a deterministic wallet like electrum.
Electrum generates all your addresses from a 12 word seed **except** priv keys they have been imported.
Just generate a proper Electrum wallet, write the seed down in 2 or more locations and send coins to the wallet. 
If anything happens to your computer or you forget the encryption password you simply restore from seed.
EDIT: if your breadwallet is suffienctly backed up then importing into electrum might be safe however your change addresses will be in electrum not bread so make sure the electrum seed is also backed up (on paper not computer).
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:41:31
Hopefully before 2018
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:52:52
Absolutely, test your seed at least once to make sure its the same wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:15:18
Electrum allows you to recover the entire wallet from a 12 word backup seed.
Bitcoin core is good if you want the whole blockchain.
bitfinex is an online exchange don't store your money there they have been hacked before.

You fail to see the logic in cores argument. Lower blocksize = more decentralisation.
