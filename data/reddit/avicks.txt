I saw that in an earlier post which raised my concern over it. When I searched for various places you can redeem them with a bunch of sites didn't seem legit. Those gift cards could come in handy I just didn't want to trust a site and have it rip me off. Thank you for the link!

Ah okay, there's just so much hype and information overload all over the internet it's hard to sift through the garbage. Since I'm also not American I think that my Coinbase account won't work in that sense either.

Thank you! Yea as a student I'm a lot more nervous about putting money into it before I figure it out, $20-500 might be easily worth the risk for some but for me every penny counts right now. Thanks for the link I'll definitely check that out!

Thanks! Unfortunately I live on opposite side of Canada but I'll check out that site.
edit: Didn't mean to put Vancouver*

Thank you! Yeah I agree, I've been following the "politics" of it I guess for a while now but never really understood it that well. Even though I'm a bit late on the parade I just thought it would be neat to check out now than 10 years down the road when I'm kicking myself in the ass for not looking into it further. True, it's going to very very difficult for it to become an everyday medium if the Gov. can get a piece of the pie.

That's what I figured, it seemed a bit daunting anyways with need for all the hardware and such, thanks!

That's what I figured, I'm going to stick to investing bit by bit into rather than going into mining. Is Coinbase good for Canadians? I started my wallet there but it's still undergoing all the info verification. Thanks for the reply!

Wow thanks! there's quite a wealth of information on that wiki that I'll have to check out. Not many physical places near me but online does have several places that would help out.

Have you used that site before? That's pretty much exactly what I wanted to do with them after a while but are there a lot of scams on it?
