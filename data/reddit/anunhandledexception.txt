Bitcoin Core does and Bitcoin Core also doesn't make more than one connection to the same /24 subnet. The problem is many other wallet developers take a much more naive "everyone is honest so we will connect to anyone" approach.  Those wallets broke when a significant number of he nodes turned out to not be honest.

Um Satoshi came up with concept of SPV wallets about a year before the genesis block.  He indicated multiple times that most users would not run full nodes.  Have you read the bitcoin whitepaper?

Thanks.   I don't see the raising the block limit will change the average block size in the near future.  Historically txn volume has roughly doubled each year and that will probably continue.  Predicting the future is difficult as another bubble could cause an upswing in volume but I would expect the average block size to exceed 1MB at some point in 2016.

I think one option would be to enable Bitcoin-Core to operate in SPV mode while bootstrapping (initial blockchain download).  This would give new users the ability to immediately gain SPV level access to the network and then within a day (or few days) switch over to a supporting full node.  The same would apply to nodes that are offline (and thus fall more than a trivial number of blocks behind the tip of the main chain).

By that logic because people use iphones the term TCP/IP doesn't exist.  TCP/IP still exists.   If Bitcoin is the core infrastructure for a massive explosion of consumer facing app .... the term Bitcoin will still exist.  Just like the terms TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, etc exist.  Now Joe consumer might not know the difference between REST and CSS but person who wrote the app he loves certainly does.

This is D&amp;T from Bitcointalk.  I can't believe the reddit username DeathAndTaxes was taken by someone (and never used).  I don't know about brilliant but thanks for the compliment.  I believe the more important question is **how** do we raise the block limit.  It is my hope the post helps to shifts the discussion from "*should we change the block limit*" to "*what is the best way to change the block limit*".
P.S.  I am better at writing code than writing essays so if anyone was traumatized by the poor grammar and has good editing skills I wouldn't object to a proofreader.
