A psychic reading service. Psychic readers using bitcoin is the perfect combination.
I myself have been doing readings for several years now ( just for friends) but very recently decided to offer my services here on reddit in exchange for btc. I like the idea of the anonymous nature of it ( powerful psychics need to be careful, I know people who have been harrased by the secret service to work with them, if you refuse they can make your life difficult).
Anyway I made a post offering my new service on jobs for bitcoin, drop by if you want more details. Or just send me a private message if you would rather.

Maybe your bitcoin is safe but when reading your post I get a picture of her with a credit card, a credit card with you as the account holder but with her name on the card. Dude, she has applied for a additional card without you knowing.

Thankyou, and tomorrow, at lunchtime, the girl sitting down (on a red chair?) Who catches your eye. Say hi, it could be the start of a new friendship.

Yes I often chuckle to myself when I see photos of famous and important people.

You think that's bad, I knew what satoshi was thinking before he even thought of it.
