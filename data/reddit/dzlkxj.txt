There is a possibility, yes. But, if we look at stocks regulations, it's far more liberal in HK than mainland. Wait &amp; see!

At first I was thinking it was some kind of wordplay between "hold" and "Hodor". Like a retarded guy who want to keep his position whatever happens.

It happenned. Okay, this one was a big joke. But I am confident that the next vulnerability will be exploited much more wisely.
Even mature open source projects are not immune to security issues. I don't see why Bitcoin and Ethereum should be any different than Linux, OpenSSH or OpenSSL.
And I am not even talking about smart contracts...
BTW, thanks, but I don't hold anything on exchanges. Everything's offline. Exchange hacking was my primary concern and made me think a long time about how to hedge my investment before putting any fiat money into crypto-currencies.

Thanks for the insult. Always a pleasure to discuss with smart people.
Of course, blockchain implementations are all perfect, without any bug, no tricky side effect to be exploited. It never happened, and will never happen. Sure. Keep believing whatever your favorite guru told you. Blockchains are true magic!

You are right. I cannot wait to depend on the russian government farms!

Hong Kong has its own legal system, but whatever some people here think, Hong Kong is part of China. It is just unlikely that China enforce a crypto-currency law in Hong Kong.

It's like fiat money except... you can get hacked!

That's a bit childish. Let's just be compassionate with those who miss this big evolution of our societies !
