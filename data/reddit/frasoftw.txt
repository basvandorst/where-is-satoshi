How can he say he doesn't think it's ever been used for nefarious purposes and then, in the next sentence say that they combat illicit activities every day? If it wasn't used for bad stuff you wouldn't have to fight against it being used for bad stuff. 
What a twat.

But the prostitutes are buying the ads, not the Johns. And the prostitutes arent having johns pay them in btc. I don't disagree that the prostitutes don't want to join the clubs either...

I thought the whole point of inflationary currency was to encourage spending/investing rather than holding currency.

there are lots of credit unions around me, but I moved 7 months ago and never switched, so the closest branch of my credit union to me is about ~400 miles away.
I had Direct ING which didn't have any branches and was online only... worked fine.

I don't have a problem with [Europeans being weird]( but to use , for both is just silly.

Please decide if , is a thousands separator or a decimal.

I think credit card companies understand food purchases better and are more able to look at the receipt and say, "Yea, we believe you did buy this 200lbs of bacon... they even have a picture of you checking out." Where as with bitcoin it just looks like a transfer to a sketchy online "company" where you didn't get anything in return.

I may have come off as more negative than I intended, I did really enjoy the episode.

I'm not a bitcoin expert, but since confirmations are based on finding blocks through mining, and mining difficulty increases to keep the 10 minute average creation time... I wouldn't think  more processing power would change the time per confirmation.  If everyone suddenly got Jalapenos today though, it might make confirmations quicker for the next 2 weeks until the difficulty changes again.

IIRC Bitcoins are infinitely divisible. If we need more decimal places because of the value of an individual coin, then the devs can just tweak the clients to allow more decimal places.  
TL;DR: They thought of that.

Is this the same guy as "The Daily Bitcoin?"  What happened after the first week?  Burn out?
@_date: 2013-08-30 22:36:57
you can't download "verified blocks" the whole point of the block chain is that each client verifies each transaction

I used bitfloor yesterday/today.  My deposit went in at 15:56 EST on 04/08/2013 and I was able to exchange them on bitfloor at 08:16 EST 04/09/2013, an elapsed time of 16.3 hours.  I am US based.
Evidently it is usually faster, but LocalTill is having some trouble.

I always figured that the monthly charges were a big part of how porn sites got revenue, from people who would forget about the charge until the next month.  Is this not true/how are you dealing with auto-renewals?

I enjoyed the episode, but I'm somewhat concerned that it's more of an echo-chamber than an honest discussion on bitcoin.  Without anyone against bitcoin, or even anyone qualified to speak on economics or stock trading - both of which have some relation to the current bitcoin environment - you're just going to end up with "bitcoin is awesome" until something bad happens.  
I don't think it would have been challenging to find people saying the same thing you said in this episode before any bubble.  Regardless, I think it may improve the quality of the discussion if you have someone play devil's advocate, or bring in someone from a different field to help even out the conversation.

Right, but I really have no idea, I haven't seen anything that would suggest it's a capital one account.

I didn't have any trouble ordering, but it appears you gave me an invalid address?
Regardless, a QR code would have been better, I think.

I'm not saying that this is a bad deal, but you have to consider the cost of money and opportunity costs as well.  If you took that $500 and invested it in (something else) how much would it make by the time you've spent $500 at amazon.

300 Mh/s for 2btc is a steal?

could probably get the same effect by turning the o in bitcoin into the dial, although that is somewhat gimmicky 
on second thought, it's hard to tell it's a dial when it's by itself... i still think it could work out with a little more detail on the dial.

Ah, thanks for pointing that out... I should have known there was a reason bringing lots of hardware online right after a difficulty change wouldn't work.

I think the reason the client takes so long is that its doing verification after downloading a block. If you get this torrent do you still have to verify?

Capital One 360 was originally ING Direct until about 3 months ago.  They didn't change much except look and names.

Bitcoin doesn't work like email where the information is only sent to the person receiving the email, the information (input address, output address, change address) is sent to everyone. Each person with a bitcoin wallet (that is also a full client [as opposed to a thin client]) sees each transaction that goes though. So they can't just say "this person got a bitcoin transaction, and therefor is obviously the owner of the wallet."

Hey, I just checked... my P2P was returned as well.  Actually it looks like it was returned on Sunday the 21st.  Thanks for the heads up.
