blockchain.info wallet is a browser based wallet
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:11:12
tried ios and another desktop and multiple browsers and still the login button sticks with a pusling white circle. Surely it should allow me to login even if the funds have been siphoned/hacked away

Are you talking from experience. As i've seen nothing that tells me i can do this, and dont want to risk even more trouble for myself. Still hoping that blockchain support will respond
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:11:08
The problem is i cannot actually log into the new wallet, or the old one. Yet if i set up an entirely new wallet on a different email address I can log into that empty wallet immediately.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:43:15
have you ever used the blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:40:12
I've googled it for the past month, and there is no help in this matter.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:14:24
Thanks, makes me feel a shit ton better

Looks like he didn't. Sorry James - [

But the same applies. If i transfer money to another account in fiat banking, then no fees apply
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:54:13
Didn't know this. When do transaction fees kick in for high amounts  in banking?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:38:49
the only thing of use there is to tell me to go to  and put in my 12 word pass phrase that will then generate my private key. Dont know this site, and doesn't seem a very secure thing to do, when the page doesnt even have any url security itself.
Is this the only way?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:22:18
There are no private keys in my blockchain.info wallet that i can find
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:58:46
Newbie here too. Only a few weeks myself. Whats your setup as I'm trying to understand mine. Buying small percentages every week, using blockchain.info wallet, and worried that I'm not really on the right platform
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:05:49
what do you trade?
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:16:33
what are your transaction fees per trade?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:42:43
Totally new. seed? do you mean my 12 word thing? Also I've not changed address that i know of, where should i be able to find the private key
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:19:45
how many different prices of bitcoin are there?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:34:10
So as i'm thinking of transferring my small percentage of a bitcoin to another wallet (hardware or paper) will i be charged for this?
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:37:45
So the fiat banking system is cheaper to use
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:45:43
yes. And i dont mind. No one here should. Still a noob myself. blockchain.info wallets use coinify to process the payments. Your limited to a daily limity until you verify on debit card, and even then your limited until you confirm verification for bank transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:36:01
So at the moment using cards are cheaper than using bitcoins, as debit card transactions cost the user nothing?
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:34:51
Correct me if i'm wrong, as i hardly use paypal, but do they have fees on transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:52:19
How the fuck does that work out? Is this the same with all wallets? If this is the case whats the point in buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:21:22
New myself. Mining is out of reach and not profitable to most without a huge cash injection and monthly electricity fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:51:15
I see something on amazon for £10 I pay £10 using my debit card no transaction fee. If amazon accepted BTC then there would be a transaction fee. Or would the price be cheaper using BTC and then include the added transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:18:14
It is? If I'm thinking of keep buying bitcoin just as an investment?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:58:38
will my private keys end up in the electrum wallet. Sorry for the question seeming stupid complete beginner.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:52:30
I'm just trying to understand
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:10:29
I didn't realise i would pay fees for transferring them to another wallet, that i own. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:13:38
How long, and how many purchases?
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:15:20
I personally wouldn't trust it. No expert, but your passphrase is your security blanket. Putting that on a website you dont trust could lead to someone accessing your funds
