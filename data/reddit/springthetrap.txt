Water performs work and has mass, but 3.75 kg of water gives you no indication of how much work the water can do. Likewise 3.75 kg of electrons is not a measure of energy.

Not gonna lie, the Genesis Block sounds more like a scifi device than a historical event

Yeah I could totally imagine the real Satoshi lost his keys. I can't imagine the real Satoshi sending his laptop in to get fixed, having the service guy throw away the hard drive with the only copy of the keys to nearly a million bitcoin, and just being like "okay cool."

Seriously, it's like taking a portrait to be restored and them giving you back a blank canvas. Again, it could happen, but no one's going to act like it's standard procedure and be fine with it.

You want to hold the bulk of your assets in something stable and reasonably liquid, and you always want to diversify your holdings. As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, it will become more stable and liquidity will increase, but in the short term it's one of the most volatile and illiquid assets out there. If you're significantly up, it makes sense to spread those profits around a few different asset classed so that you can buy the next dip. And trust me, there are plenty more dips to come before Bitcoin achieves parity with fiat.

Oof just 15 minutes before the dip, that's gotta hurt

By diversify I just mean any asset that isn't going to dip when Bitcoin dips. 
A portfolio of some promising alts could be good in general, though personally I'm staying away from them until the stigma of the scam ICOs of early '18 has been moved past. 
The big alts like ETH I suspect will go much the same way as Bitcoin, so I personally wouldn't consider those to be diverse assets, but others might.
You can always cash out to Tether or one of the other pegged coins, which has the stability of fiat, but without the hassle of actually converting out of crypto. 
But of course there are plenty of investment opportunities outside of crypto like stocks, bonds, futures, fiat currencies, real estate, etc which you should have in your portfolio as well. There may be less potential upside and they may be less sexy, but if you got bills to pay then taking the fortuitous bitcoin winnings from the past few months to pad up your more stable investments is a pretty solid call.
Also worth considering is paying off debt. If you got credit card debt at 25% interest rate, paying that off early is equivalent to an investment paying out 25% gains. Personally, I think we're likely looking at a decent sized recession in the next year or two; anything you can do to get your debt burden down before it hits is going to make getting through that much easier.

People making loans and generating interest will always have to have access to substantial amounts of money which is otherwise sitting idle (ie stored money). 
Sure I can give a bitcoin to some company in exchange for them paying me back 1.15 bitcoin in a year. But what if I want to spend that bitcoin on something in 6 months? What if the company folds in the next year? What if they simply refuse to pay their debts? Going alone, I lose all liquidity and shoulder all risk.
With a bank, if I want to spend that bitcoin in 6 months, the bank just gives me some other person's bitcoin so the company doesn't need to continuously be able to give me back my money. With a bank, the one company may fold, but that loss is averaged with a large number of other loans such that it's incredibly unlikely I won't see positive returns. A bank does the work to both evaluate loan candidates as well as collect debts, so that I don't have to.
Pooling your resources with others by giving your idle money to someone who will do all the work of managing the loaning/investing process and give you guaranteed returns and allow you to pull your money out at any time in exchange for being allowed to keep the interest beyond that guaranteed minimum is an extremely sensible arrangement. Banks long predate fiat, they will endure long after it as well.

All these news sources nowadays are asking for support as it's harder to be profitable while remaining high quality, but back when it was easy to be profitable and I did support them they started cutting corners and putting out clickbait all while pumping their sites with as many obtrusive ads as possible which was what made me cancel my subscriptions and put on ad-blocker in the first place. Politically I am very opposed to Trump, but I am glad the media is suffering at the hands of the monster they created. I can't wait for decentralization to overtake the media industry.

Give 10% of your savings to charity every year and they will have money for a decade. Invest your savings in an asset that makes 10% per year and give them the profits and they will have money forever.
