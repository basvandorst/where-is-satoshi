What a great way to regift BTC and spread the word!

Buying into it at this point necessarily makes us speculators. I am not in it for short term arbitrage trades. I see this more as a long term hedge against profligate governments - namely the USSA.

Is this real time or sped up?

Don't report it. Fuck the state and its murderous minions.

D'uh! It doesn't matter what unit of account is used. People securing the blockchain would have to be paid transaction fees.


They wouldn't but this does not mean the blockchain is not useful for not strictly currency purposes.

Ummmm......investing isn't just arbitrage. There is something called "hedging" which is what going "long" on bitcoin would be to divest oneself of fiat.
People who believe in this technology may not want to ever sell it for fiat and I would encourage not only holding it but actually exchanging it for real goods to help legitimize it even further.

The blockchain is the real revolution; even if bitcoin does not succeed this technology is not going away. Distributed and cryptographically ensured trustless networks are what will bring down the state.

Any long term holding strategy where one does not plan a complete sell off ahead of a currency collapse (whether brought about by bitcoin or political chaos) is hedging whether the OP realizes it or not.


It does not matter. If people decide to subvert the US dollar hegemony all at once there is nothing the USG can do about it. NOTHING.


Maybe, but the IRS could never prove any such transactions ever happened from me so for all intents and purposes I would not report realized gains.

Bitcoin cannot go away unless the internets goes away. This is just getting started and the technology is still in its infancy. Bitcoin and competing currencies like it will drive centrally planned currencies to 0 and make governments powerless and irrelevant.

Anarcho-capitalism is just a description of how things really are free of violence and coercion.
Bitcoin is the total embodiment of free exchange in money. For that ancaps tend to think of it as ancapish.
Besdies this, everyone is just arguing over terms which isn't very useful for the legitimacy of BTC.
Who cares? Does it work the way it is intended to?

Yes, that's right because the solution to all our problems lie in choosing between big bank-supporter A or big bank-supporter B. 
Good luck!

What is the best way for a solo investor to get in on BTC - as a hedge or the typical buy low, sell high arbitrage game?
Would buying a few high performance machines to set up a mining camp be a worthwhile investment?
