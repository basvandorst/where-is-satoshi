i see.  so there is no mechanism in place to stop the use case i described.
Its based on trust via history (which seems fine as long as the history isnt manufactured)

I dont mind paying a little extra for safety

My point is, that moment
after buyer and seller meet.  Who goes first?  Whoever goes first, whats to stop the other guy from sprinting away?
edit:  I clarified the description

A good index fund of course is a better investment in the short term.  Wealth protection is gold for the most part and treasuries. But this is not the actual point.
The point is, **day trading Bitcoin is a bad idea if you are not a professional.**

When is Bits gonna be the standard.
Everytime i discuss Bitcoin with people, they say they wont buy cause they cant afford one -.-
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:05:16
I understand.  Thanks!

To answer your question:  no, you shouldnt sell.
To answer your second question:  If what you say is true, your a millionaire so who gives a f** about a post on Get some hookers

1 he can probably kick your ass since hes been doing brazilain ju jiutsu for a long time.
2 please dont treat bitcoin like a religion and form tribes who hate each other.  We all want bitcoin to succeed, that's a common denominator we can all get behind.

ok, i was just wondering if they came up with an ingenius way to mitigate it
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:34:29


Your a fucking retard
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:11:55


How does it work?
Buyer:  here is $1000
Seller:  runs away
possible right?

wealth or mining?
miners are not necessarily wealthy
the big mining pools are primarily in china but that has thus proven inconsequential.  Bitcoin PoW has yet to be broken and is the only blockchain security that has, thus far, been proven effective.
Bitcoin's wealth may have a centralization problem considering Satoshi may be holding 1/21 of the total supply, but the 1% elite of the worlds wealth hold much more (and have attained it using some of the bloodiest and corrupt methods available in any nightmare).  There are exceptions, but most have attained their wealth in a less than altruistic fashion.
So there will be pockets in Bitcoin of wealth holders, but that is not relevent really when comparing Bitcoin to gold or the dollar or any other commidty/currency.
Bitcoin is in competition against other currency/commodities and jealousy/envy against people who saw its brilliance early (early Bitcoin hodlers/risk takers) wont even enter the paradigm when the market battle heats up (as Bitcoin reaches the proverbial tipping point).

since there are many exchanges, cross exchange fraud would happen that would punish any exchange "faking" numbers.
If they set price too high, people will buy from a cheaper exchange, send to their wallet at the corrupt exchange then sell.
If they set the price too low, people will buy from the corrupt exchange then send to a legit one and sell.
The scenario you describe already happened when there was only one exchange (MtGoX).  Willy bot.  Thats how the price shot up to $1100 a couple years ago, through fraud.
The recent spike to $1100 was legit.

Bitcoin couldnt even qualify as a fake currency for games since it would be so corrupted (programatically picking numbers from one to quindecillion is easy)

Listen you.
I possess a certain set of skills.
None of which is likely to help me hurt you in any way.
But when I see you next time.  I will take a photo then kinda use MS Paint to take your head off your body and put it on some kind of bird or something then make some kind of meme.  
And you will get SO SO ANGRY.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THAT DAY.
BEHOLD THE ICE MAN COMETH

[Not far now](
But seriously, gotta do the research.  There usually is no such thing as easy money.  
I personally treat Bitcoin like a gold investment (real not paper).  You dont day trade a troy ounce of gold and I wouldnt day trade a Bitcoin.
Buy it to hold onto for 10 years.
And Ether is a lot riskier than Bitcoin based on the recent split (at least in my mind).  I do hold both, but again, dont freaking put your kids college fund in it.  Thats an amazingly not so intelligent thing to do.

The price hasnt gone up in like a minut.. Ahh damn..

Even if BU is destroyed.  Who will follow core when they resort to ddos'ing to win the fight.
Is that what we signed up for?
Make a wasteland and call it peace.
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:05:28
And even if BU is destroyed by ddosers... who came to Bitcoin to follow a tyrannical group of ethically malnourished ddosers?
I didnt sign up for that.
