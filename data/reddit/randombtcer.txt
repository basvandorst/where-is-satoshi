Interesting, can I try it? 
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:15:13
You dont need a second life acc for virwox. 
Source: I've went this route.
@_date: 2013-07-02 06:45:21
Lookd awesome! Grabbed the last code, will report back with feedback.
@_date: 2013-06-08 12:19:57
Go fuck yourself scammer.

I forgot to./:
@_date: 2013-05-19 15:33:42
Ooooooh! Even better. I like that too. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:44:33
Any updates? Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-07-02 06:50:21
Do you plan on releasing any updates or new features? The app is nice but if I close out of it, kill it in the multitasking tray, and re-open it the data points are reset. Any way of preventing this from happening or have it update in thebackground without the app running?
That way you could have like 1hr, 12hr, 24hr, 3 day, etc charts.
Over all solid app. :)
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:47:54
Alright, maybe that's what I'll go with. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:17:58
Hahahaha redditor for only an hour. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:05:17
I call bullshit.
@_date: 2013-05-23 05:00:49
Would love to try it! 1MDfTWisoBcWNbsmZC4AxuvV7tbbvDu9ex
@_date: 2013-05-24 04:36:47
Awesome thanks so much.
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:27:57
Haha not so fast there...
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:16:05
Try here maybe? @_date: 2013-08-07 22:11:45
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:05:57
So then ASICs are computers for SHA-256 hashes? O.o
@_date: 2013-05-21 04:32:48
Share 50 of it arond reddit at .1 increments. 25 go to ASICMiner, 10 to cold storage, 10 to buy things, and 5 to use on mt gox.
@_date: 2013-06-24 21:22:12
Redditor for 1 hour. Yeah, sure.
Edit: I apologize to OP, just seemed a bit sketchy. Good review, Rock on. :)
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:10:30
Still a pretty interesting thought nonetheless :-)
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:38:12
Possibly. Could take a few days up to a week. :/
@_date: 2013-05-31 00:18:26
 :-)
@_date: 2013-06-29 04:57:46
huh? 
@_date: 2013-05-18 05:23:47
Hopefully these become wide spread. Quick and easy way to convert fiat to BTC, plus good for those wanting to get their feet wet.
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:18:52
Sweet! Got the funds, really excited to test this out. Is the export function enabled? Also will there ever be an import feature? Thanks :)

@_date: 2013-06-01 05:52:35
Coinbase or BitInstant is a good place to start to buy BTC. Then you can but ASICMiner shares or use it on an exchange to buy low, sell hi. Or buy some, hold onto it for a few years and see what happens. As for a wallet, coinbase is good or blockchain.info as well.
ALWAYS use 2 factor auth if available. :-)
@_date: 2013-06-23 05:37:21
Buy reddit gold (for yourself) with it :D
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:45:17

@_date: 2013-05-29 12:47:45
Unless maybe he was intentionally leaving it out in the open? O.o
Edit: thanks for the gold! 
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:48:52
Now that looks interesting, have an upvote.

Bitinstant.com, campbx.com money order via USPS, coinbase as well.
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:17:21
No joke.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:29:08
Wow, very cool.
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:49:41
I'm guessing (s)he means that everyone that mines makes enough profit at the minimum to pay for electricity? O.o
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:55:07
Huh. This is odd.
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:06:18
For future reference, use the NoScript plugin for your web browser. :-) As for your actual question, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:58:11
$133.4 now
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:50:41
What can this be used for then? O.o
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:59:48
You maybe able to CPU mine Litecoins, then trade them for BTC... Check this table out though: 
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:13:16
You sir are a hero. Well done.
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:24:00
Awesome, thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-08 12:56:32
Minimum of 100 comment karma though. :|
Bitinstant.com is a quick place to convert fiat to BTC. They'll have their moneygram option up on Monday I think.
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:43:14
Is it required to have an account in order to transfer usd to btc wallet via moneygram?
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:58:47
Genius. Absolutely genius.
@_date: 2013-05-19 15:32:56
Yeah I know about google auth at Mt. Gox. I mean the whole text/sms confirmation thing. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:18:05
Any chance to recover it? Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:52:24
Haha wow, let's contact him/the website: cber webmaster
Be sure to send them a good amount of emails.
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:56:14
How much does something like this cost?

Why cant people just have them for fun or for novelty? That's not harming anything...

Glad to see China in first, pretty motivational to keep spreading the word about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-06 17:37:53
Should be fun. :)

Mt. Gox was not seized. Only some of the funds going to them.
@_date: 2013-08-06 05:09:32
Paypal -&gt; Virwox -&gt; SLL -&gt; BTC
Google it. :)
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:58:36
Neat concept. Maybe add an option for a specific exchange? gox = mt gox, stmp = bitstamp, btce = btce, etc?
@_date: 2013-06-22 13:56:02
Dont believe this guy, Snowden does not have a bitcoin address yet that we know of. The address above has no bitcoins in it so he probably just created it on the fly.
Edit: Here's what he posted. 
Go fuck yourself, scammer :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:32:45
Warning: banks WILL seize your funds for no reason. They don't give a damn even if it's not legal to do that. If you do get to your funds from your account somehow, I'd withdraw it all and 1) go to a new bank or 2) store it somewhere else (safe?).
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:55:28
Better off with Avalon ot ASICMiner. Friendly word of advice: always read into the company that you wanna buy from. There's LOTS of scam websites out there.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:38:48
Trouble logging in over here. Wait it out, it'll be okay.

Please update this thread when you have sent out the invitations? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-29 03:09:58
Coinbase just launched a paper wallet service which simplifies the process. I'd reccomend reading up on how paper wallets work and such. Safest way is cold storage w/ offline computer but most paper wallets are safe. Always proceed with caution though.
@_date: 2013-07-08 23:41:53
BitInstant must be tied into the NSA.
@_date: 2013-06-07 22:06:07
It's nice to finally see more of these out there though. I wonder how much you could turn around and sell one for.
@_date: 2013-05-31 05:42:48
NO THANKS GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:13:14
Any updates? Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:48:11
Have an upvote, I agree completely. Let the masses decide and go from there. Personally I like using one whole BTC as the denomination instead of mBTC or such. Why? I know the current price for the hour/minute and if I need to send half a coin, I know it's half of the current price in USD/fiat (for example).
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:11:24
What goes up, must come down.
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:04:35
Nice referral link. /s
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:19:50
Thanks! :D Will you bring the ability to import addresses?
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:11:13
TLDR; So basically we have to be verified in order to add or withdrawl fiat.
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:50:13
Can we input a btc address instead? :-)
@_date: 2013-06-30 20:13:12
Try localbitcoins.com or you can use virwox.com to do paypal -&gt; L$ (SLL aka Second Life Linden) -&gt; BTC
Then withdraw the BTC to your wallet. I reccomend blockchain.info OR a paperwallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:55:50
As long as you were able to get your coins from the stolen wallet on your phone to a new wallet you created, you should be fine. Enable 2 facter auth as well. :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:06:20
They did. Alllllll gone. So sad.

2nd rule on the sidebar:
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-05-30 05:03:16
Redditor for a year with barely any post history? Uh yeah.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:52:36
How is that the case? I think he gave his passphrase but I'm not entrierly sure...

Turn on/use a VPN out of America. Problem solved. Same with Tor. Tor will allow you to access it still if you reside in the US.
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:15:08
Tell them to shove it up their ass too.

Long answer: no
Short answer: no
@_date: 2013-07-05 06:10:36
Cool, thanks for your input. I assume their trustworthy and reliable?
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:16:43
Count me in.
So all we do is enter in our email?
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:56:19
Usd transfer via moneygram/zipzap always has worked for me. Try sending a personal email to Bitinstant's owner.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:39:16
Get out of here, bitmunitions.
@_date: 2013-06-30 20:23:43
Sure thing. I suggest the virwox method. It takes a few days because they have to manually process things for new accounts but it's worth the wait. :)
@_date: 2013-05-31 11:20:30
Nice try, shill.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:28:45
Classic Gox.
@_date: 2013-07-05 07:00:09
Right, I always think that. Just from what I have heard is that they are pretty decent.
Thanks for the reminder though. :)
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:12:05
Wow, thanks for the gold! :D
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:49:23
About - 1 Gh/s on BFL...
@_date: 2013-06-02 05:48:03
THIS. Or invent in ASICMiner shares or day trade/buy low and sell high.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:05:49
día feliz de la torta amigo!
(Happy cake day, friend!) :)
@_date: 2013-05-19 14:32:57
Right. But using this for mt gox and such would be nice.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:30:52
I think it will still proceed, there was a recent post here about it.
@_date: 2013-05-19 16:06:41
There is an infographic somewher here on that explains a transaction. :)
Found it:

@_date: 2013-06-02 19:26:33
How much for 3?
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:19:32
Welcome to the party! Best of luck to you. :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:25:27
Awesome, thanks. So I guess my concern is, like with bitcoin-qt it is "online" and all my addresses are "online" as well but offline Armory, no one really knows what my address(es) are because it's not "online" right? Last question: what happens if I have 10 BTC in my account and send out 8. What happens with the left over 2 BTC and how does that work?
Thanks again, Beyondem. :)
@_date: 2013-05-22 04:13:53
