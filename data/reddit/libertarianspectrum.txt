If they started getting paid in bitcoin I bet they'd start paying attention

These places advertise that they accept bitcoin so they get tons of customers but then when you want to pay with bitcoin they're like lol

We hit 250 a few times today so I think we'll be seeing 400+ soon just because of price momentum

Or just carry a concealed firearm like the rest of us.

Just another needle-stab in the back of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:58:05
I've started doing this also it's fun and you don't have to actually spend any btc
@_date: 2015-06-17 01:28:06
It's good

I've only had to pull my side-arm once and that guy set a speed record for getting out of burger king

People who are into bitcoin will naturally gather people in and around your business who have capital to invest.
@_date: 2015-06-24 01:36:57
Every time I spend bitcoin on something I imagine that the moment is being immortalized in an oil painting. I'm changing the future and rejecting banks and government

Shills act like credit cards work all the time with no fees but this is the reality.

I want a way to post on reddit, gamble with my btc, and speculate in bitcoin opportunities all within one window. My bedroom is already TEMPEST shielded. I'm working on a shielded subaru

What is 2.1 quadrillion satoshi in US $? I'm assuming it's way more than 8.2 trillion in fiat

Are you saying venturebeat.com isn't on top of the hottest venture/beat stories happening right now??
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:13:12
Same, I just keep averaging down to profit. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:27:38
Maize has taken a bit of a beating lately:
But I think (with good logistics) you could buy some US corn and move some serious (bitcorn?) down south to avoid all the banks and you just need some peso fiat for greasing wheels on the way. Then you can easily cash out corn for bitcoins

The hitman was an FBI agent, no murders actually took place, therefore no crime was committed.

It's legit. They'll even pay $10,000 of your legal fees if it turns out you bought merchandise that was purchased with stolen gift/credit cards: 
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:32:41
Thanks for the update

The cheap coins are now, the bounce will be incredible
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:50:21
If Bitcoin is good enough for Microsoft, Amazon, and Paypal then its good enough for me! They have a lot of smart people that wouldnt buy bitcoins if they were going down and staying down.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:13:22
Don't sell!! If anything buy more and average your cost/coin down. When its back up over $600 next month you'll be glad

I like the idea, I'm going to try to get a girlfriend now
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:17:38
Just because you can't conduct all day-to-day business with bitcoin yet doesn't mean it's not a valid store of value. It will be useful soon as businesses adopt it more increasingly. 
Today I could buy bitcoins and spend them at Microsoft for a video game and in the same transaction I could buy the same amount of bitcoins back so at the end of the transaction I still had the same amount of bitcoins, but slightly less fiat
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:13:37
I've converted my bitcoins into QR-coded 3D printed handlebars so that I can physically hold on to them.
@_date: 2015-01-09 04:45:44
Was he talking about how they are rebuilding and increasing security or the other thing?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:41:17
Bitcoins are better than diversified risk because they're decentralized risk.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:34:24
Its literally like being able to go back in time 2 years and buy bitcoin while it was cheap. I bought alot today
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:30:43
Putin should start an alt coin where you can only mine as much in rubles as you already have
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:50:33
I wish I had more money to buy more. I think I'll start mining until payday just to scoop more up in the meantime!
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:19:03
I would play this game if someone tipped me
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:44:14
It's an opportunity!
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:39:12
I agree, why allow join forces to completely change the consensus model of Bitcoin? It seems like a no brainer
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:50:14
This guy knows what's up. Even if the value of bitcoin were to drop to $0.01 you would not have lost money as long as you don't sell. This is why you can't go wrong buying bitcoin!

If bitcoin were dead could I buy my baby's medicine every week? Spoiler: my baby isn't dead so yes I can

Say what you like about his position on bitcoin; that is a handsome man
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:21:57
He probably has a lot of coins and he's just saying bad things about bitcoin to make his investment worth more
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:02:32
Is this the thing that finally actually matters or another behind the scenes technical change that doesn't affect anything?
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:24:41
I think seeing one dev leave will rally a lot of holders because of the fundamentals
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:51:21
You can't just use bitcoin, you have to go through a company that will turn them into dollars first.

Value is subjective, is sunshine on my palm worth more than a hospice patient's last smile? I try to approach this problem in a productive way, ie: taking a big picture look at the situation and then maybe I'll check the position of some planets and boil a big bag of eels

Just add people as they are RTed by people on this list. I once did a search of bit coin instead of just reading my follow list and there was a bunch of negative stuff so just stay with the people who know bit coin.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:39:42
It costs like 1.5 bit coins an hour to fly that thing

The "MYTH: Bitcoin went bankrupt" topic already has 3 answers but I'm not sure exactly what the status is of bankrupt bit coins
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:16:42
You just wait, bit coin will be a big issue in the 2016 elections
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:39:05
Weak hands spend or sell, it's the definition. The true utility of bit coin comes when the price is much higher.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:56:45
Are those good miners?

They won't be calling people batshit insane when the bit coin holders are living in the bullet-proof skyscrapers while everyone else is folding fiat origami shivs just to crawl to the next highest sewer tunnel

More like "when if" than "what if". And there have already been a lot of scenarios where people would have been better off with bit coin and there will be a lot more in the future for people who haven't figured it out yet.
