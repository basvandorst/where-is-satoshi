You’re probably right, I don’t see any scenario we don’t end up with a single network that speaks all coins.

Are people who clone and run bisq nodes regulated like an exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:43:01
It’s buggy af if you day trade, and support never replies

MIT can and does co-exist with copyrights. It’s a license to use copyrighted work.

There are three buy orders and no sell orders on bisq. Tell me again how this is going to work without liquidity.

For some reason I thought it had been in development for several years.

GDAX eats the fees. Transfer from coinbase to GDAX (this is basically automatic as the account will show up in GDAX), GDAX to your wallet, no fees.

I think you owe on coin swaps too.

short term capital gains @ same rate as income at the time you made the swap

That is a centralizing solution.

Who is the inner circle? David Kleinman, Hal Finney, and Craig Wright? It’s lonely in the inner circle right about now, if so. What would be the point of revealing the keys? That’s commonly thought to be an enormously destabilizing event for the whole space. It depends on motivation. If they have bad intentions, then it seems more likely that they would dump the Tulip Trust coins on January 1st, 2020 on the BTC chain and buy BCH with them. Whatever happens, it’s definitely not boring.

There’s a Renaissance happening with .NET Core, but it really doesn’t matter anymore what the backend is in the age of serverless computing and containers; just use the tech you know the best.

Yes, I download it and run it locally only.

Definitely Bittrex — most coins I sold there show up as if I never sold them.

With the slight caveat that if you used a BIP44 Passphrase (like a seed word you provide yourself), if you only have your 12 or 24 words, it will restore a valid but empty wallet.

What if we put the chain on IPFS and mounted it as a virtual drive? Then you wouldn't have to have the storage yourself.

It will cost the LN operators to make use of it, and likely the cost is higher than the fees they make for broadcasting transactions? I mean, maybe this makes sense for large LN operators to opt for something like that. I don't know how it would affect the ecosystem. Ideally it worked in the software for everyone running a node.

I feel like you might be confusing an HD determined address with your xpub address. Hardware wallets use HD addresses so it appears as though every received transaction is its own address — because it is. But you now own an infinite number of deterministic addresses linked by your master key.

I tried to use it but it incorrectly parses several exchanges to the point it thinks I still own piles of coins I sold long ago. I contacted support and they didn’t reply at all, so this year I might write some OSS to do this and throw it on github.

It’s an optional additional passphrase on top of the seed words that is a deterrent since omitting the passphrase will restore a valid wallet but not the real one.
