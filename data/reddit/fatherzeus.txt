I do agree in some part. But it should be noticed that adblock blocks annoying adds by default not all of them. Of course if you want to block ALL adds you still con do so. I'm not exactly sure what the criteria is so I removed all of them from the blacklist and started blacklisting manually.
For some time I stopped using adblock because adds had got civil and it is the only way we can get free content. It's what developers and creators of free content need to make money.
That said I went back to using adblock. I removed all ads from the black list and started to blacklist them manually just to make sure. Most adds I will see and I'm cool with them. But some *(I'm specially looking at adchoices)* are too intrusive. Plus the ads that I get from them always are on the **WTF** side. 
I don't understand where these ads come from. I'm a male reading some world news and get during a day or days the exact same add over and over again, lingerie. Why? Then I was getting one about a cruise. I hate cruises but what ever just try to ignore it. But the damn add is too big and bright. Then I notice something weird. The cruise pictures three guys, one behind the other, hugging. Then I read its some sort of all male cruise. Why am I getting this? Every single ad from them has nothing to do with me and is extremely big and bright. 
Plus the fact you see the exact same ad in 3 to 5 **different places of a page** and you will see it in **every page,** **every single time** for **days**. At least if you are going to show me an ad let it be a different one each time.
So that's why I use adblock. I will see most of the adds but if you have big annoying adds I'm blocking them. There are plenty of sensible options.
TL;DR: I'm all in for ads so people can make money from their sites. But if you have big annoying ads I'm blocking them.

Being a HAM Radio operator I took a much safer approach. 
I got an old computer I had stashed, installed linux. Connected a radio and captured noise from the antenna picking up satellites. The noise would give me random stuff and that was my passwords/keys generator.
Now I'm more paranoid to the point I don't think anything I do will actually work so I use the usual password generators and mix them.

That explains a lot.
