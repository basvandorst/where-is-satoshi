Is there anything stopping a successful hardware division from purchasing the wallet company in-house for an arbitrary value, say less than 20 times the first funding round?
Mycelium as a whole I'd be interested in. Not keen on slicing off the wallet to win investor money; this creates upside for the rest of the business but not investors. 
If Mycelium want to be the Microsoft of Bitcoin, I want a shot at investing in Microsoft, not in MS-DOS. I will push the bandwagon but I want a stake in whatever it ends up carrying.

I wrote this in another thread but think it might be more relevant here.
It's a little bit like intellectual property rights.
My photos could be used by instagram for any purpose, since by posting them I've already given up copyright.
Transferring copyright to someone else is the same as a third party like Gox dying with the authority to spend your coins. It's out of the bag. You've given it away.
Personal backups won't protect you from someone infringing your copyright (or spending your coins) if you've already transferred to them the right to do so.
Never let someone else look after something if they are able to steal it, lose it or use it for their own gain against your will. Especially when nobody is there to guarantee any losses or punish the bad actor through regulation.
All the people who didn't give up their rights are unaffected. 
Dollars have the regulation aspect pretty well covered, but they are constantly being devalued through inflation via money printing. 
Bitcoin's absolute security places huge responsibility on the user to make sure *your* secure money doesn't become *someone else's* secure money.
 Dollars take some of that responsibility away by replacing absolute security with regulation.

Thanks for the link. When I said signing I meant specifically bitcoin transactions, since this is the bitcoin subreddit.
Yubikey cannot import keys, only sign using keys generated on the device. This limitation is mentioned on the page you linked to in the comments made by the yubico team.
Also gpg signing isn't bitcoin transaction signing. You could use it to decrypt some encrypted private keys, but then you'd have to sign with them on a computer.

You totally can. If you ever have problems, make sure the system times of the devices are correct. 
It uses system time and the seed to generate the one-time passcode, so technically the authenticator never has to be 'online' (unless the qr code resolves to a web address or something).
If your device system time doesn't roughly match the server it will give you mismatched codes.

Paper backups don't defeat the purpose; why do you think they would? Trezor is no different to an Electrum online/offline installation, and a paper seed backup is fundamentally important to this strategy.
You can't sign a transaction generated by a deterministic wallet with a piece of paper, you'd have to import it into some hardware. 
Trezor stores these keys internally and *they cannot be stolen from the device*.
Currently I do what the Trezor will do using a Raspberry Pi. Trezor will make this much simpler for me, hopefully with less risk of making an error.
It sounds like you are playing with paper keypairs and haven't experienced a deterministic wallet with offline signing.

Maybe i care more than i thought, it's a slow day here.
Killer app is a marketing term. Nobody sells the conceptual internet. Selling access to it because people want to see porn that way over any other is a different thing. 
In my opinion, the internet (or bitcoin) can no more have a killer app than 'Going Outside', or 'The English Language' could. They are things of the people, their adoption is not broadly mutually exclusive of other things, though they may present a competitive challenge to their alternatives.
Adoption of these things doesn't fit into the marketing terminology from which the term was created, ie direct benefit for a company owning a platform *designed and marketed* in direct competition with alternatives.
Totally my opinion, and I know that language evolves, but I like to draw attention to it when it does. It is starting to mean app as in 'thing that is applied' rather than the original meaning of computer application.

Asking questions that you can answer yourself shows you do not have a robust attitude to learning things.
Bitcoin is unregulated, if you fuck something up you only have yourself to blame.
If you are unable to use freely available search tools to find out simple things (example CDs), this game is probably not for you. This becomes the answer to your original question.
Some very important points to note if you insist on proceeding:
Always use 2 factor authentication. If a site doesn't support it, don't trust them to hold your coins. Back up the 2fa QR with a screenshot or something.
The safest way to hold your coins is sent to an **offline generated and stored** private key that nobody else knows.
A deterministic wallet like Electrum is extremely useful. The 12- word seed phrase is functionally a backup of all your addresses, past present and future. You can maintain an air gap by running a separate offline computer (eg raspberry pi) that signs transactions for broadcast on the online computer. Not strictly necessary but good practice and the best 'protection vs functionality' tradeoff until Trezor.
Mycelium is the best android wallet, it handles paper keypairs neatly by sending change back to the original address.
If you're asking what a CD is rather than using a search engine, you might not be ready to deal with the next steps of what to do/not do after you buy cryptocurrency.
Edit: Hint: you'll need to use Reddit-specific and wider search engines to make sense of the jargon bomb I just dropped. I'm not trying to show off. I wasn't born with knowledge, it's all out there.

First impressions: PIN entry is fantastic and intuitive. Numbers displayed randomly on device, just click corresponding position on screen.
Seed backup encourages writing one word at a time and forces a recheck through all the words. You'd have to deliberately ignore a lot of stuff and click dozens of times if you were ignorant enough to skip writing it down.
Receiving onto a Trezor 'account' using the myTrezor wallet is easy. Sending is straightforward and forces two visual screen checks and confirmation pushes on the device.

Strangely, it was approximately twice that on BOGOF day, so someone ordering one early and one 2for1 deal gets three for about the same price each.
I'm torn because lots of people probably paid more to be involved in the pre-order. Still, if produced in volume they should be cheaper than the prices I mentioned above.

For extra peace of mind it's good practice to test it for real.

I like this idea. I also like the idea of 'pay and display' parking where a machine prints a QR public key from a master private key that is held centrally by the company.
To pay for parking just fund the address and leave it on the dashboard. Parking attendant can check when you paid and how much by querying the blockchain.
Accept BTC only and have a bitcoin exchange machine (ATM) next to the ticket printer. Users can either buy BTC for themselves or just put in enough cash to fund the parking voucher.

But buyers don't really give a shit. Sellers of virtual goods and services utterly rely on making it as easy as possible to get the the buyer to hand over the money.
Bitcoin is currently not easier than PayPal for the buyer from a new-user-of-either perspective.
There is no fairtrade 'support your local farmer' scheme for digital artists/content providers. That shit doesn't matter as much as 'real' transactions, they are usually non-essential purchases and therefore easier=better for the buyer. 
If better seller protection made it more complicated they'd make fewer sales using that method.
I hope it changes though, but it's a matter of time, familiarity, increased adoption and proper legislation (no 'grey area' shit)

Both totally handled by divisibility, which is the same for gold and bitcoin. 
Gold can be thrown in a volcano (call it irretrievable on a human time scale), and the other gold becomes worth commensurately more.
Gold is of course divisible to the atom which is obviously inconvenient. Bitcoin accomplishes the same with a simple change of index of base 10 (ie as value increases refer to quantities with smaller numbers).

Easier to back up, more useful and flexible was what I said. Single backup covers all future addresses. Can relatively easily memorise a seed compared to a whole series of non-deterministic private keys.
Software deprecation isn't an issue for me or for many. Since I'm backing up data i might as well back up source/binaries too. More than that; i'm actively *using* it so I'll know when something better comes along. 
Your example about keeping hardware alive to run it is slightly irrelevant in the overlapping worlds of linux and virtualisation. Recovery, if no longer compatible with the reference client of the future, would be something you'd have to do *once*, then you'd just send to the new best client. 
Software from the mid nineties? With Electrum we're talking about open source code, freely available on the internet here, not Quicken or Encarta. The algorithms are in plain sight, it's a different problem to the one in your mind if it's a problem at all.
On balance, i think it's well worth the convenience now (with no loss of security if signing is done offline) to risk potential incompatibility in the future.
You're going to have to pick a winner at some point if you want more functionality than paper keypairs provide, like any business handling bitcoin would. 
No doubt Electrum will adopt the standard sooner or later anyway.
 I don't care for fanboyism. For Electrum read Armory, Multibit, whatever has a deterministic wallet style. I just use Electrum.

I'm doing some gentle profit taking too (or at least I was 2 weeks ago!).
 Basically I'm replacing worn out items with nicer versions and buying back only 50% of BTC, making them all half price while not drawing down too quickly. 
Gift card purchases and a reliable instant broker make this easy, no exchange required.
 If the price heads north again soon then my buying power is back. If not, I can wait, since I'm mostly upgrading stuff I don't *need* but have wanted for years, which give me great long-term value.
The same way that decompressing air refills your lungs when floating to the surface while breathing out, the price just keeps on going up to refill your spending power (except with less death if you get it wrong)!

No, but I disagree that it's a bad idea.
If you are concerned that the Electrum seed standard will become deprecated, all you'd need is an old version to be able to generate all your private keys. Brainwallet.org can also generate an Electrum chain from seed. The internet never forgets.
Failing that back up Electrum or brainwallet yourself. Arbitrary maybe but it's still just an algorithm.

Thought I'd add, if you've got one or two high-balance addresses in a deterministic wallet you could back them up separately as paper keypairs. 
If you want to spend them in the meantime (before the less-than-credible scenario of the world forgetting how to recover an Electrum seed) it's trivially easy to spend them and the wallet automatically handles change to a new address, recoverable from the same seed backup.
Post imaginary-information-Apocalypse you could just sweep them all into a new wallet.
So I'm saying do both if you need to, but draw on the benefits 'while they last'.

Historically this is the phase where profits are taken.
 Ease of 'cashing out' by spending or by instant
 exchange to fiat will inspire confidence in the next exponential growth phase if it comes.
It can now be shown that there are many easy ways to cash out, which was what was missing last time and was what caused people to dump large amounts of coins for cheap when exchanges failed or became unreliable.
Easier exchange *into* bitcoin is happening too but is being held up by legislation problems/grey areas.

Have a read up on how it works and check your terminology.
 Bitcoin is like a foreign currency, not a gift voucher. You don't redeem it, you spend it or exchange it.
Really good wallets: Electrum for PC, Mycelium for Android. You'll looking to import your private key into one of those so you can make transactions.
Most important thing is to understand the irreversibility of everything you do with bitcoin, and the fact that the private keys must be kept private (from thieves, hackers, viruses etc).
Think about selling only after you understand more and you'll reduce your risk of loss enormously.

Transferring copyright to someone else is the same as a third party like Gox dying with the authority to spend your coins. It's out of the bag. You've given it away.
Personal backups won't protect you from someone infringing your copyright (or spending your coins) if you've already transferred to them the right to do so.
Never let someone else look after something if they are able to steal it, lose it or use it for their own gain against your will. Especially when nobody is there to guarantee any losses or punish the bad actor through regulation.
All the people who didn't give up their rights are unaffected. 
I've still got the same amount of bitcoin, and the valuation is becoming about more than just liquidity of one particular exchange.

I live in the UK. 
My takeaways from this thread: the US tax system sounds like it sucks.
 Also, bitcoin is used by Americans who are keen on subverting their tax system to avoid future hard work, and these people think this dishonesty is acceptable because they haven't been told otherwise by the IRS.
I might be twisting words here but honesty sound like a no-brainer to me however much it hurts.

You mean the mechanics of bitcoin's *valuation or price*, right? 
I've never used a real exchange in my life. Valuation is the only thing about this mess that affects me, and even then only slightly since most of my transactions are 'buy back what you spend'.

Trusting someone with your private key again!
Think of it like cash. Give it to someone else (bank) and they are responsible for it, where it is insured by FDIC/UK FSCS etc. 
Bitcoin isn't, so don't trust anyone with your private keys. Trust is great if that's what you want to do but unless it's insured you still lose if it all falls down.
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:48:22

You are right that they will be stolen at the point of transaction on insecure computers, and from people that trust others to hold them instead of holding them personally.
They **cannot** be stolen from a brainwallet with sufficient entropy which exists only in one's mind, and where any transaction signing is done offline, securely discarding keys on completion. 
This is the thing that is new and exciting that has never existed before (since we are repeating ourselves).

During the recovery process, one is prompted to enter additional words which are not part of the seed. Seed words are not entered in a predictable order. This is a nice touch which should prevent keylogger attack.
I've also used Wallet32 for Android to recover from the same seed. Works fine, and means there's a simple recovery solution without number-crunching, command lines or buying more Trezor devices. Trust me though, you'd want another one if you lost it.

An Electrum deterministic wallet is easier to back up, more useful and more flexible for day to day use.
For ultimate security, sign transactions offline and then it's at least as secure as individual address/private key pairs. A master public key can be used on your online computer to manage receiving addresses. 
A raspberry pi, old laptop or even a clean sandboxed virtual machine could do the offline signing.
Paper wallet is a misleading term that has unfortunately caught on. [They can still be useful]( though I have no idea why people make them as fancy as you do unless they are gifts.

About sixty-five pounds each on the days of purchase (just over $100?). The BOGOF deal worked out at twice the cost of the single one so mine all cost roughly the same.
Of course I may have repurchased the corresponding amount of BTC on the day and fixed the price in GBP.
 A steak you pay for in in USD isn't 'soon to be a $600 steak' because you didn't use the money to buy bitcoin. The exchange rate to establish an item's value is set at the point of transaction and has nothing to do with opportunity cost or currency holding strategy.

Recover it from the screenshot of the QR code you took (!) when you set up 2fa.

If you didn't make a backup and you can't find the QR once you're logged in, disable it and sign up for 2fa again.

So you're happy giving the merchant's scanning device your private key and a means to decrypt it?
The hardware that signs the transaction *must* know the private key. You *must* keep your private keys secret.
Ergo, don't trust anyone else's hardware, and take steps to make sure your own hardware is clean and secure.
Edit: if your hardware signs the transaction offline, you can trust any hardware to broadcast said transaction, as long as transferring the signed Txn between devices doesn't expose your private keys. This is Trezor's approach.

They could set up a direct debit in my name, yes, but the [direct debit guarantee]( would mean I get the money back if it was not a subscription that I requested (from the bank, not the exchange, then the bank will pursue them).
 It's outside of a normal ACH scenario because of this guarantee.

You instructing an exchange to withdraw is not the same as actually sending the coins, this was your problem.
Only problem I've had was when the local establishment I ordered from didn't respond to calls, they must have been shut that day and not notified takeaway.com.

People call things whatever they want. A paper wallet is usually just a single address/private key pair, but the misnomer has stuck. Also people can't do metric/SI so that subject always turns into a bag of shit too.

Totally agree. I was highlighting the 'barrier to entry' for a credit card. Bitcoin doesn't care about application processing time and creditworthiness checks. 
If you're starting from scratch, bitcoin is confusing and hard, but not impossible. Credit cards are someone else's yes or no.
Nor does it allow someone to take money from you. Credit card fraud is a thing. So is bitcoin theft, but at least I can handle the security stuff myself.
I think both Credit Cards and Bitcoin are awesome, especially credit card buyer protection schemes. I totally use whatever suits the occasion.

Right, but if they stopped finding it, gold wouldn't 'break' as you are implying by requesting that old coins be taken from their original address and redistributed.
I can find gold that someone has stolen and buried that belonged to someone else, does it mean it's mine? Who decides? Because nobody else was using it, or they have left it loafing, a reasonable judgement can be made.

There are many services like this here, they seem quite popular. A friend introduced me to doing it this way, I always used to just call.
Only takeaway.com accept bitcoin so far but some of the others allow you to save a debit/credit card so they are pretty fast to use. Dealing with a single intermediary is probably better than giving the details over the phone to random restaurants.
Some places have an extra delivery charge via the intermediaries that isn't there if you go direct. Most places near me have free delivery after a minimum order value though. 
I usually pick a place with free delivery and tip the guy a couple of £ anyway. 
No bitcoin tipping yet, I presume the orders just get converted to fiat transparently so the guy might not even know how I paid.

I wonder if they had people buying Trezor on the peaks since all of someone's *other* coins that they weren't spending were suddenly worth so much? 
Consider this: someone has 10 btc.
If 1BTC=£100
She may not be willing to pay 10% of £1000 to secure the remaining £900.
If 1BTC=£1000
She might be willing to pay 10% of £10,000 to secure the remaining £9000.
In either case, the Trezor still costs her 1BTC.
Not a sustainable business model in my opinion but a bloody interesting experiment. It relies on people making questionable decisions or even altruistic sacrifice in the belief that it will make the project happen.

Any (most?) online wallets should offer 2 factor authentication via Google Authenticator app, or Authy. You'd then need the one-time-passcode from this app as well as your password to log in.  
**Make sure you back up the QR code you scan to set up the account with the app in case you lose your phone.**
Most places will have a link in the sites security settings.
You should already be using 2factor if you use Dropbox, gmail etc, it's a no-brainer.
Obviously if the online wallet site gets hacked/goes down you're still out the coins so online storage is to be avoided.
Electrum is most secure when set up as described in their [documentation page]( where transactions are signed offline. Commonly known as cold storage, this means your private keys are safe from malware since they live on an offline computer. 
Up to you whether the convenience of having your keys on an online computer is worth the risk. Offline signing only adds a couple of steps. I use a raspberry pi.
Backing up private keys unencrypted is as safe as the place they are hidden. Look at [BIP0038]( and/or fireproof safes :)
I stamp my offline Electrum wallet seed in flattened tuna can metal with letter punches that cost about £5. 
Hope it helps. 
Edit: Thanks for getting back to me with your info, more effort in the question *without exception* results in more effort in the answer, at least from me.

Great advice. Even better is to include this as a rebalancing strategy for a proper investment portfolio. Aim to keep x% of your net worth in bitcoin. If the price changes buy/sell accordingly and keep your bitcoin as a % of net worth roughly constant. 
Add to all investment categories proportionately when you can and rebalance when it suits (infrequently!)
 Spending profits is silly unless you are retired.
Reinvest them into something with a lower risk profile.

Thought about this for tickets at a cinema. Take a (throwaway) public key ticket from an automated printer. It holds your seat for fifteen minutes so you can fund it.
The business keeps the private keys for all tickets issued.
Then you've got a prefunded voucher that says you paid, and the receipt is on the blockchain. Can prove ownership of paying address in case of disputes (on mobile or Trezor eventually).
Would work for pay and display parking as well; display the funded voucher and the attendant can scan the code to check when you paid and how much.
 Also means you could send extra funds to the ticket  while you aren't at your car if it looks like you won't make it back in time.

Every ten minutes, at the price you are talking about, $40,000 worth of inflation eats away at the value of everyone's bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-11-15 20:31:56
 The fact that they are not reducing the price means they are not taking the piss out of supporters of the project.
A preorder is always a risk. If the product actually ships and is as advertised, then my converting sixty-something pounds to 1BTC worked out well. I can't say that for the current price.
The problem with the current price is *not* a problem for customers since the product isn't actually shipping anyway. You can't have one yet.
It might be a problem for the development team if they need to raise more for production because they probably have no buyers left at this price.
Since the production costs are in dollars and they received BTC from customers, this is not likely.
If you are late to the party and you haven't got lots of money to throw around, *you have shit it for now*. It's like the Kickstarter was funded and you've got to wait until it makes it to market properly.

Accidentally deleted my message. Bugger.
Basically said that i consider a wallet as the gestalt of the client software for signing/broadcasting transactions *and* its data file containing private keys.

Printing with Linux can be non-trivial sometimes.
Deterministic wallets, if you haven't tried them, are simpler than they sound and *so much simpler* than individual private keys overall.
There not really such a thing as a paper wallet, just a paper keypair. Then you have to import then to another device to send unspent outputs and you have change addresses to worry about.
Backups need encrypting separately meaning extra software (truecrypt) and you have no quick/way way of seeing a qr code of a key of you store in bulk in notepad as plaintext.

I suppose you are right, I was thinking one step ahead and I was focusing on the fact that the physical coins are often sent unfunded.
If Mike formally separated the physical coin sending element from the funding phase, the physical coin sending would probably not fall foul of the 'regulations.'

Speed up payment in queues, I'm thinking theme parks cinemas etc.
Someone can walk down the line handing out qr codes of public keys for addresses controlled by the business, or display a sign with a link to a website that generates an address to use.
People can fund the address in line while they are waiting.
An employee scans the funded address at the head of the queue and verifies they have paid.

Localbitcoins. Read their FAQ. In fact, read everything.
Another technique I use apart from reading is replacing the word bitcoin with the word Bacon. This is a sanity check. Bitcoin/Bacon is a commodity like any other, you have a set of specific things to worry about.
 You know by second nature that Bacon should probably be kept refrigerated and neatly packaged for transportation, then cooked thoroughly before eating.
Do you often ask about Bacon safety? Probably not, because you have good Bacon knowledge that has taken several years to acquire and has probably mostly been obtained through the subconscious exposure to a variety of cured meats.
Bitcoin is more complicated than Bacon.
 It will require much effort on your part to fully understand Bitcoin, however it does not have the potential to give you gastroenteritis.

This would both realise a loss and cost you fees *out* of silver and fees *into* something else. Looks like you bought silver in 2011; if you don't need it right now then let it sit.
Try and add to other investments to get some diversification that way (fill in the gaps rather than split what you've got).
You might have to work your butt off again but you'll be glad you did since you'll have a stake in each rather than half a stake minus two sets of fees.
Edit:  frugal investor. Borrow from your McDonalds fund rather than your existing portfolio.

@_date: 2013-11-15 21:19:03
This is cool. If you use Electrum make sure you stress the point that he shouldn't play with exporting private keys. This could undermine the wallet's security.
 Imported keys are also not recoverable from seed so best avoid that too.

Electrum offline on a raspberry pi with the master public key on your main online computer.
Read Electrum documentation page about signing offline transactions. Easy. 
Back up the seed by stamping it on a metal plate (eg flattened tuna can) with letter punches.
Until Trezor comes along this is the easiest secure way to run a proper secure wallet. All the addresses you'd ever need with the simplest backup method. You could back up address labels unencrypted if you want.
Don't bother faffing with individual keypair paper 'wallets' unless they are for gifting.

Spend some from way down the list of generated addresses. Send then to yourself even.
If you aren't generating the same addressea as your seed then you won't be able to sign the transaction.
If you *can* sign it, you know all previously generated addresses should match the private keys in your 'seeded' offline wallet.

The Bacon thing was just to filter out whether you were really interested or whether your question was, like so many in here, a flippant one that the op doesnt even come back to. Glad you found it funny though :)
Definitely avoid PayPal. Sellers will vastly overinflate the price because it is possible for buyers to claim they never recieved the bitcoin. 
PayPal have a history of siding with the buyer but they have also been known to close accounts that are used for trading cryptocurrency on eBay. 
If you use an exchange to buy (eg Coinbase) it is good practice to send your coins to a wallet where only you control the private key.
 If they shut down or are hacked, you may suffer delays getting your money or worst case never be reimbursed. This is not a slight on Coinbase specifically but is true for any online wallet (even localbitcoins).
Blockchain.info wallet encrypts keys client-side  and send you an encrypted backup via email so they seem safer.
Basically, if you are thinking about trusting anyone, research them for least ten minutes in here, at bitcointalk forums and on Google. Try and get both positive and negative opinions and take note of the distribution of each!
Private keys stored on your machine are at risk from malware or datsloggers or theft.
Backups of your private keys with an encrypted wallet export or (even better) a 12 word seed phrase from a deterministic wallet should be stored in several different locations.
So that covers keeping your coins safe from yourself :)
As far as selling goes, I've only used localbitcoins cash trades.
I place a reasonable markup (not so big the buyer would drive ten miles to save a few %) on an advert. I mention in the listing that I only accept cash out of an ATM to protect me from fraudulent counterfeits and to protect the buyer from having to walk around with a wedge of cash.
I've started asking if, once they've entered their PIN, they are happy for me to watch the amount being keyed in so I don't have to count cash in the open. (so far been a Yes). Money goes straight in my pocket, coins are released to them by text message to localbitcoins. I get a code sent back to me which, if it matches their secret code they brought with them, enables them to know I've done it correctly.
If you decide to use a service, read everything they have as well as everything the community says about them.
Be quick to be put off, be slow to trust anyone with your money.

It depends how you send it. You'd have to import the paper private key into a wallet to be able to spend it. Where it goes depend on the wallet software you use.
If you import into Mycelium, the change gets sent back to the original address.
If you import into Electrum, it gets sent to another address on the key chain that you own (a change address) to preserve pseudonymity.
Edit: Blockchain specifically, no idea. Use mycelium, it's a much better phone wallet.

The biggest problems are reluctance to learn and dumbing down.

Consider this: a company like bitpay has £1000 and 5 bitcoin to is name. Exchange rate 1btc=£200.
If someone paid them in bitcoin and they had to 'instantly convert' 1 btc to £200 to deposit in a customer's account they are actually *exchanging* for £, not converting.
 Disregarding handling fees etc they now have 6 btc and £800.
If the exchange rate moved against them and they were forced to give their customers £500 for every btc, they'd have 6btc and £500.
See how they would eventually run out of one or the other?
Eventually this means buying back £ on the open market with all it's crazy fluctuation.
*If* they could predict the fluctuation period *and* they could move money instantly *and* have up-to date market data they would make a killing, if not they'd be killed. 
Sound familiar? Exactly like real life sped up.
I'd love bitpay to clarify but they probably buy currency and charge a higher fee than it costs them, rapidly, from a reliable exchange. Low frequency fluctuations in valuation don't really affect them since they can quickly buy back the cash they give or with their btc before it fluctuates too much.
The (even slight) inefficiencies of this transfer system would act like a huge low pass filter tuned to a frequency well below that of your example.

I totally agree about prices denominated *in bitcoin* but many prices are determined on the fly to a high degree of precision against current Fiat price.
**This is happening now**, and isn't just about what might happen in the future.
 I view this method as a nice easy way of writing a long decimal number to make it easy to speak out loud.
It's exactly the same way that commas (or points) are used to ~~delimit~~ differentiate prefixes for high precision numbers in the order of thousand, million etc.

Mint is great, consider using it 'for real' instead of just dual booting. No need to use it at all though, especially if you do the following:
Run Electrum on your main computer with master public key only and run on a raspberry pi with the full seed.
Setting up an offline Electrum wallet is pretty much as secure as you can reasonably get as long as you trust your RNG.
It only adds a couple of steps to sending and no extra steps to receiving or balance checking.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:57:08
What you've done there is make some cold storage *addresses*. When people say paper wallet it is generally a misnomer since it's usually only a single address.
Why not generate a deterministic key chain using Electrum? You can write down some of the public keys for sending to and you know in the future you can recover all corresponding private keys from seed.
If you have spare hardware you could even sign transactions offline.

Recommending online wallets is also a bad idea which introduces risk to your reputation based on another company. 
Far better to concentrate on the concept of operations (addresses, keys, change etc) and give some examples using the reference client, a light client like Electrum and only then maybe explain that online wallets exist but are riskier.

Things are only unknown until you know them.
 Unless you are proposing a solution, either learn how to use bitcoin to your advantage or pay someone else who will take a cut using the existing schemes (western Union, PayPal &amp;amp;c).
In answer to your question: there will be lots of people who are not used to having to learn for themselves and check original information sources. They may be scammed, or may make mistakes or just decide it isn't for them.

It doesn't cover actually generating coloured coins so I don't know fundamentally whether the only person that can test the colour is the issuer or whether anyone can check.

Right. The seed is all you need to generate the entire sequence of all the addresses and change addresses the wallet uses.
The password is to protect them one they are generated, at the point of use, ie on your computer. If you forget it you can restore from seed.
If you store the seed anywhere, make site it's protected (in a safe or truecrypt container).

No, I wouldn't be, so I'd pay No pounds.
 An expensive paper ~~wallet~~ address/key pair isn't much use to me since to send coins from it would render it worthless, unless imported into an offline computer for signing transactions. Even then you would have potential change address issues.
If I'm adding this extra step to maintain security I might as well use an offline deterministic wallet and just stamp the seed on some scrap metal.
Tuna can: free. EMT shears: £2. Letter punches: £10

You can make as many copies as you need for geographical redundancy at no additional cost.
If you are concerned about a security breach, making more is only a portion of tuna away.

If anyone has your 12 words, they can generate all your addresses into a new wallet.
You can set a separate password which protects against someone just signing transactions with the wallet you've already generated on your computer.
The bonus is that the seed is it's own 'lost password 'recovery' system. Never lose it or share it. All you need to back up is the seed, any labels you set for addresses and any private keys you import separately (eg if you import a paper wallet address to spend it).

Actually that would mean the currency inflates by the value of the new coins. 
You are saying they are instantly sold to buyers which may or may not be true (almost certainly not).
Mining rewards add inflation pressure, devaluing existing coins however currently the net effect tends toward deflationary as buyers and increasing adoption are keeping the price high.

You then were presented with an invoice for a different amount, which was the total including transaction fees.
You typed in a different amount to this total, which was the original amount which you remembered from earlier. Similar, but not the same.
This was not the full amount and therefore not enough to completely settle the payment .

We have a name for a million dollars. I just typed it.
We have a name for a bitcoin. Same. 
Everything else is represented as a power of ten of either base unit.
SI units group them into neat little 'three power' prefixes.
 Million. Thousand. Unit. Micro. Milli. The Satoshi is an anomaly.
I know you know what numbers *mean*, what i meant was that you need to develop the agility to read a decimal number written fully and have it correspond to the prefix in your mind. That way you can speak its short form if you want.
0.001 means Milli. 0.000'001 means micro.

Casascius coins have a paper disc inside the hologram with the private key on in minikey format..
 The hologram makes the coin pretty waterproof.
You don't need the printed characters on the outside of the coin to redeem the private key, this is so anyone can verify the coin has a balance without destroying it.

Orienteering. Check all the locations until there is one with a universally recognised widget. Take a photo with yourself next to the widget and a time stamp, publish it, referencing all previous pictures that have a verified widget.
You can't publish a new one unless you are up to date with where all the previous ones were found.
The widget can't be counterfeited and is easy to verify just by looking at the picture.
The locations are nearly infinite but the amount of hidden widgets at any time is inversely proportional to the amount of people that are looking for them.
They are distributed randomly and are shuffled  instantaneously between locations every time a new one is found.

Speedybitcoin.co.uk are good but they can be slightly more expensive. 
You can't see the current market rate until you have already deposited; if the rates are fluctuating heavily there is no way of knowing what rate you are 'locking in'. They charge 3.5% but generally give you a slightly worse rate than average.
Coins arrive within ten minutes of sending the electronic bank transfer.
They work well for me since I only buy to hold and they are easy to use. Occasionally I sell on localbitcoins when someone is willing to pay a large markup, instantly rebuying with that amount of fiat on Speedy. 
Sell high, minutes later I've bought low. Arbitrage at the speed of walking to the shop where I meet LBC clients!

I'll keep it here for now and we can chop to email later if you don't mind.
I was recently discussing inoculating logs with my great uncle who was very interested. He's got enough land to do it and probably a few contacts who can get him some wood if he hadn't got anything suitable.
 Enough for a couple or three logs, 6 foot by 1 foot?
He probably wouldn't be that interested in setting up bags, jars or buying any more equipment, I just figured dowels or plugs would be a nice easy way to give it a go.
He'd get a kick out of the quirky gift anyway (he's 75, most people give the same old boring crap).

Not really, I know they are the same but converting takes effort. We are still developing (collectively by participation) the standard by which to write and say prices and this needs to scale well for large and small amounts of money.
Very rarely do we have units of currency that span the decimal point so far in each direction; you might have tens/hundreds/thousands of BTC but only need to spend a thousandth. 
If I want to see how many 1.2mBTC nozzles I can buy out of my 15.04325211 total, it seems awkward to keep track. 
Written as buying nozzles at 0.001 200, it looks immediately like I can buy ~~over~~ around 40 of them with my 15.043 252 11 before I even break a whole BTC. 
All psychological, but thats how humans roll. 
Edit Nearly 40.

I bought some Chinese food yesterday but it went via a payment processor who probably took a small cut for onward conversion to fiat. 
It did feel like a shame knowing that I wasn't sending it directly to the restaurant but they are food vendors, not forex traders.

OP have you considered if there is anything you want to buy, if it's  priced at 1 Bitcoin (eg Trezor, or worst case a cryptolocker ransom) it's worth having an extra 0.0005 or so for future transaction fees.

I have a theory about all these posts about blockchain.info wallets.
They make a great first wallet, but people get used to them. Then, when they learn a bit more about the ecosystem, they start to have concerns.
Laziness stops them from solving their own problem by taking charge of their own money, yet they come here to post and expect to get their fears gently stroked away. It never happens.
Do what you know needs to be done and stop squandering the best feature of the protocol: the ability to look after your own money.

You are trying to profit too early ravenbit. I don't want to pay for a massive chunk of the sunk cost of your hologram or your tooling.
I'd want to pay for the approximate manufacture cost and a small contribution to your setup cost which you *didn't need to pay for* since any hologram would do. 
Your coins are not pre assembled, there is no reason to have to trust them, which is good, but naturally this makes any assembled coin totally suspect.
I wouldn't ever purchase one on a secondary market which removes a lot of the fun of a coin. I cannot see who would, at this price, buy one for personal use only.
 I'd rather buy a 1oz silver coin and use a generic hologram for a total cost of what, twenty dollars?

[Electrum]( is more intuitive if you are struggling with armory.

Offline cold storage is great although it ties you to having to use extra hardware rather than slips of paper. Allows you to generate all the separate keys and addresses you need though.

You can say it like that but you would not be accurate. It's  not a thousand five hundred and eighty, is it? The decimal point is where it is. 
Obviously it 'moves' if you wrote it like millibits or microbits but you'd need to be happy multiplying this up to get a common basis for mental arithmetic which is important with a currency.

They have a pretty good reputation, despite not shipping on time and despite doing a 2for1 deal which gave new customers (even for 1 day only) a better deal than historic early pre-orders. 
I've emailed slush in the past. He's replied even though I wasn't asking him to do anything. Nice guy.
They stand to lose more from their reputation by backing down on their refund policy than they do from genuine production schedule changes. (Engineering challenges that mean you either can or can't have your product in the long run.)
If this subreddit heard that they were honouring refunds on a case-by-case they would suddenly have a *lot* of cases! I'd rather they let down your exceptional expectations and got on with making the magic happen.

Cool writeup. 
It depends on your use case but an offline Electrum install fits all my needs except for gifting coins.
It's also easier to set up and *certainly* easier to actually send coins with. 
Paper keypairs are great for what they are, but any newbies reading this need to be aware there are easier, more flexible and more powerful alternatives (deterministic offline wallets).

I'm surprised you didn't solve the case problem by using a deterministic wallet seed.

Bitcoin is seeing inflation since miners are currently 'printing money'. 
The change in valuation against other currencies is due to the convergence between sellers that can name their price for a scarce resource and enthusiastic buyers that are willing to pay it.
Are you suggesting you correct both USD and bitcoin for inflation and compare them?
The USD inflation rate is probably calculated annually based on how much stuff your dollar can buy, like the UK's CPI or more properly RPI.
The only way I can see to calculate BTC inflation is by working out a percentage by which the total coins have increased over step time. The actual *exchange rate* changes that makes it seem deflationary would be captured as hyper-deflation if you used the same method that is used to find US inflation rate.
Another way of calculating USD inflation rate would be similar to the way I suggested for BTC; ie number created as a % of whole. These charts might be comparable although they might not tell you a lot.
I re-read your post after I typed this to check it my post is still relevant. I have no idea.

Presumably the exported keys and wallet are encrypted? You'll probably be fine. 
The major risks from online accounts are from the service shutting down, or from someone gaining access by possibly resetting your password/2fa.
The attack vectors that could be used to target the wallet on your computer include:
    Malware extracting the private keys and reporting them to an attacker
    Malware changing the address that you are sending to (changing information on clipboard)
    Software or Physical Keylogger copying your encryption phrase
    
etc etc.
Look into cold storage with an offline wallet if you want security with convenience. I like Electrum. Old laptop/RasPi or something would be fine.
If you don't want to run a separate offline computer, Paper Wallets could be the way. 
Basically you want to keep your private keys (stored in the wallet) away from anything that has been or will be online.
The sidebar Security Guide link is great.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:45
It does make all wallets seem equal in the eyes of a beginner though, ie 'Paper wallets sound secure, maybe I'll use that'.
I think they are a bad idea for a first wallet and have seen posts on here where people have got themselves into various messes trying to handle individual keys themselves.
Totally agree with you that is not that important, but i think it's a shame the term is so common.

Most people don't know about 2-factor authentication even, let alone what to do/what not to do with a paper wallet. You're going to have to factor in tech support for when they want to import it, and any bad feeling that comes with them not having the right hardware etc.

It's not hard to remember an Electrum seed. 
Also a brain wallet isn't actually a wallet (unless part of a deterministic structure), and neither is a paper wallet.
If you did this, you'd have to write down your method if you want your family to be able to access the coins [after your death], so you might as well not bother.
Maybe you can have the advantage that you can rebuild your passphrase anywhere you can find the book, as long as you remember the title, edition, word number, number of pages, space separation and capitalisation used.

Assumptions and qualitative arguments do not work well of you are talking about *actual quantitative fees and profit*.
Basically, if it's cheaper to launder  money in a different way to how you said, that's what will happen.
Doing it the way you suggested is probably more expensive, but you can find out yourself by looking at the numbers. There is no particular discussion required, it either is cheaper at the point of use or isn't.

Good find. However, that requires a fundamental protocol change and is not what the OP is asking here. It also references the potential to use *more* decimal places, which confuses matters further! 0.01 satoshi anyone? :)

That might well be true but it doesn't translate to my fund type investment example.
 Investing in Bitcoin in my mind is like a fund because you are investing in something which is an enabler of many different types of business; services, hardware, payment processing etc. Some of the areas for profit literally did not exist without bitcoin. 
This might be a totally flawed way of thinking about it but nor can it be fully explained as a stock with a market cap, or a total weight of a country's currency in a forex context.
Market cap lags behind early adoption.
If you want to 'invest', and you can't see what tomorrow holds, so far over the long term the best time to buy is yesterday, failing that; today.

I use mine with Electrum running on Raspbian as an offline wallet to sign transactions. 
It only adds an extra 3 minutes to send some coins or top up my mobile wallet.
So your list of things to learn: use DD on Linux to copy a raspbian image to an SD card.
Log in with user pi, password raspberry. open GUI with startx.
Install Electrum (can be online at this point) using description on their site  Disconnect forever, open Electrum and generate a seed (copy this down) and master public key (export to USB stick).
Referring to the Electrum offline signing tutorial, install it on your normal online computer and restore a seedless wallet using the master public key you exported earlier.
When you want to send coins, create the transaction online, copy via USB to offline wallet, sign it, return via usb and broadcast via the online computer.
Regarding malware on USB: you could always find a way to burn the transactions to cd via USB cdrw if you're super paranoid. If not just have up to date malware scanners or use Linux for your main computer. I like Mint.

There is no error. There is no 'account', at least not in the context that you are using the word. There is no sweeping here. Your poor use of terminology does not help you get a clear point across.
You are signing a transaction to send unspent outputs from addresses in your wallet to a gyft address, perhaps returning any change to another address that you control.
You sent the wrong amount because of a transcription error. Your beef is simply that it was so easy for you to make a mistake. It did what you told it to do.

No. The seed isn't a password, it's what allows *anyone* to generate the chain of keys that you use in your wallet.
It is randomly generated for the first time and then you can use it to recover the whole wallet as many times as you like (or don't like).
If you don't set a password, all your private keys will be held unencrypted on your computer and anyone accessing it can sign transactions that spend your coins.

Like I said, the answers are out there if you look at the numbers, make some assumptions and do a bit of analysis. The results well be as good as your assumptions.
You'd probably find that difficulty rising alongside price increasing would limit the viability to a very small window, like mining itself.
Lots of these variables are linked in complex ways so one can't say this goes up therefore so does that. 
Analysis is basically best efforts to find probability of success to quantify risk.

It depends where all your coins are now, I'll presume you've already sent everything from your bitcoin-qt client to two offline-generated paper Wallets, one big one small, and you have an Android phone. 
Assumptions made because you didn't provide any details despite saying you would appreciate some from me.
Before you wipe anything:
Read everything on the Electrum wallet project website.
Download the latest KDE build of Linux Mint and unetbootin for windows. Write bootable Mint to a USB stick.
Boot to mint live usb and wipe everything on HDD with partition manager. While mint is up, install Electrum and prereqs as per the website (will not be persistent but who cares). Disconnect from internet.
Create a wallet and write down the seed and master public key.  Send contents of small wallet (0.001) to the first address using mycelium wallet for android. Reboot.
Install mint to hard drive. and reboot.
When mint is a persistent on your hdd install Electrum and restore from master public key, check coins are there.
Do the same on a computer that will never go online except this time restore from seed.
When you generate a transaction to send coins on your main computer, transfer the unsigned tx to the offline PC with USB key, sign it and return to online PC for broadcast.
Use windows DVD as coaster.

I was trying to think of where the north-east of the world was, but I got dizzy.
Presumably you are American and are not considering that this game is global. 
You'd behave exactly the same as you'd do if the ATM network went down. Use the cash you have left, then barter, or go to where the network is running. If you only have foreign currency (eg bitcoin, euro), you might be out of luck unless someone wants to take it. In future we might have more automated exchanges/atms.
The global aspect will maintain the network despite localised outages. The problem is then local access, which is not a new problem.

Don't bother, just set up a deterministic wallet with a 12-word seed like Electrum. I just use upper case letter dies.
Much more flexible since you can use a watch only wallet based on the seed's related master public key to generate new receiving addresses. 
If you want others to add to your savings without seeing the unspent inputs at that address you can just generate a new key. The seed will allow you to recover all the private keys to eventually spend them.
Read up on deterministic wallets, I was taken aback at how simple yet secure and powerful they can be.

There are easy ways to send the bitcoins that are under your control that make it look like they were stolen.
Similarly, if the keys were lost in a fire, there is no way to prove you can't one day spend them from an undeclared backup.
Unless you relinquish the control of the coins to the company, so they can verify that it is indeed you that spends them, the answer will almost certainly be No.
What you would need is insurance for the amount (ie number of coins), not insurance for the actual address or wallet, since the keys can be duplicated.
Functionally, you have lost nothing if you are hacked and someone steals your coins because *you still control the address*, albeit sharing with the hacker
Banks might appear that handle this for you but they won't be free.
The beauty of the protocol is that you can make your own insurance by backing up wallets/keys/seed in several locations and following good security practices.

If the computer holding the wallet was completely air gapped and full-disk encrypted would there be no need to have a password encrypting the wallet itself?
 Particularly if one uses cd-rw to transfer unsigned transactions rather than USB.
Theft of the computer would just mean restoring from seed and sending to a new address. 
Simply write down the seeds and truecrypt password and keep with a page of notes if it's being stored unencrypted but securely anyway. 
12 word seeds physically secured, private keys secure on offline computer inside encrypted container/drive. That's it.
The encryption is either good enough or or isn't. I don't think there's a lot to be gained by setting up one container inside another like Russian dolls. Just extra complexity.

I like Mint over Ubuntu but they handle most things in the same way.
I've just set up a Raspberry Pi to sign transactions offline using Electrum.
I generate the transactions on my online Linux laptop and pass them via a USB stick to sign on the Pi which takes ten or fifteen seconds, then I return the signed transaction to the laptop to broadcast.
The private keys never see the internet and the only real attack vectors are theft (it's all encrypted) or the USB key having something weird on it.
I just did a test transaction, the extra steps are no hassle at all for the safety it provides.

Thanks for the quick reply. Still no I'm afraid, but inverting the colours on either picture works fine using Android scanner.
I was a bit quick to assume the border was the issue, sorry if I wasted one of your blanks. 
Etching a negative of the current image would definitely work since you are etching in white the bits that are inked in black. 
Inverting the image will leave the background image black, as long as when you etch it there is enough quiet space it should work.

 If nobody wants their bitcoins, I'll buy them for a pound each. I expect there are a few people that would buy them for ten, a few more that would pay a hundred etc. That's just how it works, same as gold. There is no zero unless it breaks, in which case we have bigger problems.
 If gold is worth zero why wouldn't I make my cup/mirror/stuff out of more appropriate, harder materials? Hardly a benefit.
This had been said many time before but bitcoin is more than just a store of value. Magic instant sending etc. Proof of ownership through signing etc.

I'm not sure how that works but it is good practice to run a paper wallet generator with an offline computer. 
I would transfer a copy of something like [bitaddress.org]( to an offline, clean computer and generate some private/public keypairs.

Knowledge cures worry.

Learn how to make a secure password using at least 6 or 7 words from [Diceware]( so that your coins are protected from someone who has access to your computer.
Think about an [offline wallet]( so that the private keys are protected from malware or keyloggers.
If you don't recognise some of the jargon I've used, check in the [bitcoin wiki]( starting with the FAQ.

Converting fiat currency to bitcoin may mean using the full range of decimal places, particularly if as you say things will be priced in multiple of Satoshi because a bitcoin is worth a lot. I have had localbitcoins transactions for specific fine grained amount because the exchange rate was rounded in fiat. Do you even transact bitcoin or are you just guessing what it must be like?
People have lots of things and sometimes they need to add them up, there is no need to sacrifice accuracy by losing significant figures especially if every ten nanobits count. Dollars and cents are two powers of ten different, bitcoin and satoshi eight. No comparison.
Denominating everything in satoshi would have numbers either side of the decimal point that are not symmetrical. One btc and fifteen million satoshis is a nonsense thing, how do you write that without counting backwards from the end with zeros that you know you don't need?
I understand that you think the system will work itself out with usage. Not if people don't talk about it and not if some ideas don't fall by the wayside.

Has MtGox been the wrong price recently? No, it's been a *different* price based on liquidity issue with the fiat side of the exchange. That's the *right price* for those particular conditions.
Localbitcoins offer a different price because of anonymity and relatively few sellers. Nothing 'wrong' with it. 
You could even make some profit here if you think that all people are doing is buying in an exchange and slapping fees on. You might find is more difficult than that and therefore the price is higher to be worth their time.

Use a proper wallet instead of mucking around with individual keys. 
Import your private key with 0.0001 and then next time you spend anything (or needlessly ~~churn~~ 'consolidate' your money), it should get included in the total.
In Electrum you can even prioritise this address so it is guaranteed to be used.
Remember though if you import into Electrum you won't be able to restore this specific address' private key from seed.

You can use what you have but it's best practice for large amounts to store it in a system that never goes online once the private keys are generated. 
The 'offline wallet' tutorial will show you how to transfer transactions and maintain an 'air gap' between your sensitive private keys and the nasty old internet.
You could definitely install Electrum on your current system and it would be at least as secure as what you have now, since you can set a password.
 It can also be backed up with a 12 word seed phrase which you can even hand write (and store securely).

1000000 is a lot more awkward than 1,000,000 which is instantly recognisable as a million. We need something.

Only snag is the opaque exchange rate but if you avoid periods of insane volatility they are great, I've never felt ripped off by it.

Hurt is inferred. Choice of exposure to that much risk is their own, ergo they hurt themselves.
I suppose people do get hurt, but it isn't the fault of the game, just the player.
If people get hurt because of decisions they made it's nothing to do with people who win playing the same game, particularly when it's about luck more than anything.
I guess you mean people are hurt by their own greed.

All the time. Manual updates only, read the changelist for every single app.
Titanium backup to restore in seconds if I don't like the new one.
Takes *fucking ages* if I haven't done it for a while but it's the only way I'll do it.
You are doing it the lazy way, and it is only a matter of time before this could fuck you over.

Not 5 but I'll presume you are an adult of average intelligence.
No, you can install it on an online computer and it will generate all the addresses and private keys you ever need from the 12 word seed. But... your private keys are then stored on an online computer, and potentially open to malware.
By all means try it, it's dead simple and requires no blockchain download.
An offline installation (eg on a raspberry pi) can be used to generate a seed. The separate (but related) master public key can then be exported to your everyday online computer which allows the online wallet to generate all the addresses, just not their private keys.
This is fine because your offline computer has all the private keys.
That way you can track balances, create receiving addresses and generate transactions without ever having a private key on an online system.
Sending on the online wallet generates an unsigned transaction. copy this to the offline computer, sign it (click button, enter password) and return it to the online computer for broadcasting.
It's all on Electrum.org and probably YouTube.

On Localbitcoins the spread is fairly large, ie you'll sell for a lot less than they would cost you to buy. 
Or if  you don't need the cash right away you could arrange an advertisement for local sale for cash but as the price had gone up I've seen much less interest on that side of things. 
Dunno about the other one!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:05:48
Yes that works great :)
What kind of resolution can you get? Could you fit a vCard format code like [this one](
Front with vCard QR and '[name]' and back with address QR and 'bitcoin' would be cool. 
Sorry for all the questions!

It depends on how they are being handled. In a spreadsheet you can set it up to represent a plain number however you like.
In an API or in code you don't use them anyway but if I wanted to write about 0.020 010 BTC in the middle of a sentence the number would wrap.
There is no way I will get the world to bind an alt-0160 key so you might be right, ugly as a semicolon is.

Lawyers will charge you money. You can probably work out how to pay your taxes later but you'll only need to do that if/once you convert large amounts to dollars.
Localbitcoins.com allows you to sign up and send an amount to their wallet where you can sell for cash by meeting someone who is advertising to buy. You don't need to verify too many details. People have feedback there so you know they are trustworthy.
This will allow you to buy a new, malware free laptop on which you can install Electrum, the easiest wallet that lets you implement safe offline storage with an easy built in backup. Read about how it works!
This will help you feel safe that they won't be stolen while you figure out what to do.

2. Safe, secure, backed up wallet: 
3. Don't panic
4. Read everythingg

I'm assuming you mean UK Direct debit. No need since a standing order is perfectly suitable for a fixed amount.
Speedybitcoin.co.uk work well but they are not transparent, you only know what kind of deal you got after the funds clear in their account (with Faster Payments it's only tens of minutes).
 I think they charge 3.5% but generally their cut works out at a little more because of exchange differences. Dunno what rate they use either. I've had fun selling on local bitcoins for a 10-15% premium. On the walk home i wire cash to Speedy and get bitcoin with less than 5% fee.

No, it's a card with two NFC chips embedded so users can store a receive address and private key or whatever they want in each chip.
 It's not a wallet and needs to be scanned by an NFC compatible app so the user can import the private key and sign transactions with a wallet app.
**...so it's an NFC implementation of what people call a 'paper wallet' when they really mean 'paper address/private key pair'**

Electrum seed is all lower case so just use what you've got. 
Remember to input as lower case when it's time to recover from seed. It might even be insensitive to case but never tried.

They are not like files on your computer. Addresses are like transparent and publicly visible locked boxes filled with IOU's.
The associated private key unlocks the box, allowing the key holder to write a new set of IOU's which will appear magically in other boxes of your choice without needing to unlock them. One of these new IOU's might be change sent to a box you control.
 All new IOU's written must add up to the total unspent IOU's already in the box.
A wallet is a keysafe for all the private keys. Lose that and you can't unlock any of the boxes.
The bitcoins themselves are the numbers in the IOUs that can't be cheated since the protocol checks they add up to previous unspent outputs.

Cool stuff. I get the feeling that you might be spending a lot of time administering emails (I know because I sent you lots!).
The quicker you get a website to do the dirty work for you the better I reckon.

Awesome, I'll check it out thanks. 
I have seen spaces used effectively in engineering applications, it just scans better if you're trying to think about the magnitude of the number in your head. 
Other characters seem like hard delimeters that make it look like you're talking about a group of different numbers.
It allows you to quickly ignore zeroes and only talk about significant figures which we do naturally with high orders of magnitude.

 Your single point of failure wrench/rubberhose idea assumes that he has stored the private keys.
I sincerely hope nobody hits him with a wrench because they would find out he was telling the truth all along, and then neither the attacker nor Mike would benefit.
I see what you are getting at though, they are perfectly safe until they aren't, by which time it's too late. Whereas personally generated keys are safe if done correctly.

I was trying to be more than just sarcastic. It was my obtuse way of saying that you can't reliably quantify emotional meat.

Not if it uses the master public key relating to a deterministic seed held elsewhere.
You don't get it because you don't understand how offline deterministic wallets work, but that's fine. 
Just don't go smashing up parking meters please.
Edit: may I recommend Electrum. Their documentation pages have a simple tutorial on setting up a pair of wallets like this.

You suggested I call a unit of currency Hectosats?!?
The world uses SI prefixes to talk about fractions of base units as decimal numbers. The powers of ten are grouped in threes. It's already a thing.
It has to remain a decimal number since the Bitcoin is the base unit. (A decimal number *is* still positive by the way.)
True I do sometimes favour brevity, sorry if it's rude.
 Hectosats is fucking rude.
