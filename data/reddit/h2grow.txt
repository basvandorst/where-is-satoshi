I feel like there's just a bunch of sour attitude toward them still. Doesn't matter what circle does. People will find a reason to hate it.

Imgur changes metadata and resizes the photo if it's too large server-side anyways. You couldn't upload to imgur and retain file integrity. 
Plus, you'd be an idiot to store a private key on someone else's hardware that could be deleted, changed (or scraped) at any time.

I believe it operates similar to their ACH deposit system. It allows you to deposit USD and trade with it immediately at current price, but if the ACH doesn't go through eventually, it "undoes" the transactions. I believe you are still "overdrawn" for the period it is in limbo. 
Essentially they allow you to trade on their exchange, but it won't allow you to withdrawal for more than you are "overdrawn" or the withdraw more than the amount that is unconfirmed.

What about an offline implementation of armory? Is that still a thing?

Good luck guys. But better luck to me.

I bet if you had connected the dots for people in the title, this would be even more utilized.

I've been meaning to get my wallet going. This may just be the way it happens. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:58:26
Nah. Thanks though.

edit: they have rebroadcast my withdrawal and i now have my ether. Thought I would update the comment.
That they would either rebroadcast my transaction as soon as the congestion cleared up or credit my account for the ether that never made it to my wallet. 
I know better than to leave it on an exchange. The whole value of blockchain is that it empowers the user to have control of their own funds. Giving that control to an exchange is a risk. I get it. I just think it's important to note that Gemini and other such exchanges made it right as soon as the congestion cleared up while poloniex has yet to rebroadcast failed transactions.

Someone should do this with a webcam so we can watch live too.

I've been on Gemini all day.

They haven't replied to my ETH withdraw tickets or rebroadcast any of the transactions in two days.

Yeah. Fuck these guys asking questions. 
But seriously, there will be a lot of hard lessons learned here in the next few years from those less well-versed in this baby tech.
