If I donate some BTC will he hire a UX person so gpg can stop being nearly unusable?
Goddammit I do hate it so much.  
Keybase.io has the right idea. In fact, why don't they just hire this dude directly and be done?
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:24:54
You appear to have misread. That was 133.7 Dogecoin. No cents here.

Couple reasons: using credit cards on the internet is uncomfortable, given that customer databases get compromised with some frequency. Only citi visa and amex offer virtual card numbers, but citi is evil (tm) and I'd like to get away from them. Paypal is also quite evil. I don't have an amex card.
Bitcoin is magic internet money, so they're fun to use. The novelty is a plus for me.
The gyft path is promising but I'm not really familiar so I don't have an informed opinion yet.

Wait, where is that? I'm not seeing the repo where the website is hosted:
All the js and CSS and stuff. Not trolling, I believe you, I'm just curious how you're verifying a signature. Approximately 0% of the people I know check source code of a website before using it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:43:39
Gotcha. But couldn't an attacker alter history for users of the fake blockchain? I guess in order for the ruse to work he'd have to convince 51% of the network to start using his torrent all at practically the same time.

 Correction: don't download anything from sourceforge. Unless, of course, you need an Ask toolbar.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:29:20
Thanks for the clarification! You guys seem to spend a lot of effort to seem legit in ways that are hard to fake. :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:01:14
Thanks for this! Paper wallets are neat but still seem a little alien to me.
Quick question: how can you be sure that  isn't keeping a copy of the private key they're generating on your behalf? Maybe I trust them today - should I trust them tomorrow when they get hacked?
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:37:02
That's the thing. Technical implementation aside, I feel that Bitcoin is on a similar path as Napster. It's a precursor to something truly amazing. Certainly important and disruptive, but it's not the end if the line.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:19:32
Correct, as long a you keep the wallet, you're effectively sharing access with the other Satoshi. But now it's on you to move the coins before the other guy rips you off.
To represent that risk I imagine the other guy will sell them at a reduced rate, and you better have a plan in place to unload the coins.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:18:58
Cool. So, one contributor, no readme, no tests, and no source code organization. This will be a blast to use or maintain.
@_date: 2014-01-25 04:40:45
Imagine if Apple and Amazon colluded to invent a coin that they would honor. aCoin, say. Throw in Google for lulz. That alone is pretty tempting for "average" internet consumers.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:47:36
Would it be a disaster to simply share the private keys? Obviously there's an opportunity for a race to see who can spend them the fastest, but this whole online wallet going offline for weeks / forever situation gets resolved pretty easily.
I know the crypto dogma rule is "thou shalt not ever share thine private keys," but in this case, what if the end user /is/ the escrow service?
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:15:32
While I appreciate your outsized paranoia, and you bring up good points, I don't find your scenario very realistic. Despite the recent NSA revelations, I don't think it's particularly likely that the governments of the world could track this meeting down, especially if you pick a decently high traffic meeting location with less than perfect on site surveillance. The false positive rate would just be too high.
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:47:16
There's a lot of hate for TD throughout this post and how their customer support is teh suck, but TBH I've never had a problem with screwed up orders or whatever. Maybe I haven't used them enough to notice. We'll see.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:31:01


I believe one can and did. :) A truly democratic, decentralized currency is pretty revolutionary. Let's hope it doesn't go by way of the US moon missions - pretty amazing for a few years, then a fat lotta nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:43:12
Hey so maybe this isn't the place to ask about multisig but.....
With multisig and the timeout expiry, your material says that even if Greenaddress.it disappears, a customer can recover the BTC.
What's preventing the reverse? If the customer disappears, can't Greenaddress.it do the same trick?
Lets say all the customers "disappear" because you guys all get brain slugs and are mind controlled into taking down the DNS records.
If multisig is one way then cool, but afaict they are equal.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:30:40
Maybe 20 years ago... Lol inflation 
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:46:34
That's.... kind of amazing, assuming the percentage cut taken isn't too onerous. Amazon gift cards are trivially bought for cash in person for first worlders. I wonder if third worlders have the same access?
Coinbase can handle more volume, but trading anonymity for volume seems pretty attractive...

It's way more fun to have 69 of something than 0.0000095 of something. For a variety of reasons.

What do you use to cram the twenty dollars down your internet tube?
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:41:37
Where it the torrent? Its not offered via the QT interface afaict. How do you tell it's unaltered?
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:41:36
... and share your private keys with the website owners, just like you would with an uninsured bank. Right?
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:37:54
Right, instead of the fed you have market manipulators injecting wild price fluctuations. :) much more democratic. :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:57:27
They can't. They will rely on you to report honestly. They might audit you to verify your honesty. Assuming they have the money, manpower, and expertise to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:00:56
It's very difficult for me to stuff dollars into my computer to buy stuff over the Internet. Bitcoin offers a pretty seamless way to transfer the value of dollars over the Internet without exposing myself to repeat transactions (stolen credit card numbers) or scumbag third party money holders (Paypal).
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:58:10
Hot diggity, GenConfusion, thanks and you're welcome!

@_date: 2014-04-25 12:38:45
That's what I don't understand about the QT clients. What are you losing when you use a light wallet? It seems like there is no downside. Unlike web wallets, the private key is local.
I suspect there is an initial performance to security tradeoff with avoiding the QT client, but I'm having a lot of trouble pinning it down. ELI5?
As it stands, it takes days to download the blockchain on a normal USian network, so I can't imagine recommending new users ever do that.
@_date: 2014-10-23 05:22:38
If I was going to post a wallet online with a nontrivial amount of coins in it, on purpose, I'd use a stupidly long, randomly generated password. It'd be impossible to brute force without some breakthrough discovery in AES-256. I suppose that's the point of the site.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:34:49
Moolah.io does: mitm.io . multiple coins, too. Its pretty rad
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:25:55
The people in have that much. Wow such plutocracy. :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:24:45
Yeah you shouldn't. Even a dumbass like me has reported serious security issues to them. The list is long.... People are allowed to have bugs and patch them but Coinbase seems intent on making every single SaaS security mistake possible.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:43:24
With Dogecoin. :)

over in they are very proud of themselves for outstripping the transaction volume of bitcoin. hmmmm.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:52:07
I guarantee nobody has audited it. If anyone had you can be sure that the website and GitHub would have a link to the report.
So, using this requires trust, again, just like all other Bitcoin client apps. Like lifeboatz said, the PRNG could be compromised in ways that are quite subtle. The authors claim the js libraries are the same as their public counterparts, but no file integrity hashes have been provided.
Shrug. Not a big deal of course. Its just money. :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:45:16
Thanks! That makes the most sense.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:40:40
How does the QT client contribute? Is it secretly mining? Can a QT client user accidentally hit the lottery?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:46:56
+133.7 doge verify here you go, now tip away.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:09:00
It's a win-win!
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:27:32
Sweet! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:04:27
Due to the fact that it's actually good news for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:56:45
I had some fun with bitcoin, but I stayed for the dogecoin.
*Disclaimer: approximately 81.73% of my digital currency portfolio is invested in dogecoin*

Punching up the headline is the primary job of an editor. Shows that the author's title was changed after drafting. Probably right after publishing.
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:44:50
Yeah, you're probably right, best to stick with the status quo oligopoly... WAIT A MINUTE I think you're trolling!

I don't know what I'm talking about. That's what the question marks indicate.
If the seed is held by the browser, the web site almost certainly has access to it. Same origin and all that. I cannot imagine any local protection that would prevent it.
Clearly, i need to look at the procedure to see what's up.

No such problem on DuckDuckGo. I love you, DDG:
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:09:41
Thanks! Just read it over the Github repo. Seems legit.
Of course, if I'm an attacker and I get control of bitaddress.org I will bank on the fact that people will use the online version and not inspect source or anything like that.
Edit; IOW this strategy seems securable, but not secure by default. Basically like anything else with client software for cryptocoins.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:25:14
Apparently people (not me) do it for day trading. Moving coins in and out of exchanges takes forever and you miss out on trading opportunity while you're waiting.

I prefer Strongbad's pronunciation since it emphasizes the misspelling.

No trusted central authority required. I should be able to sign a message with my private key to say,  "Don't send money to this public key."

Say it with me now.
This is actually good news for Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:00:54
Presumably, a revoke message is not itself revocable. Once it's solid in a block chain, it's done.

Breadwallet is pretty slick and local, and in the worst case, can be rebuilt if the developers give up. The open source repository on Github is pretty active.

Forex traders treat their currencies like commodities too. Bitcoin may become a medium for exchange, but today, its value is expressed in terms of US dollars.
