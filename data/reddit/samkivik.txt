Awesome!  The shift away from mining and focus on simple value to new end users is spot on.  This was desperately needed by the community.  Rock on.

Their site is up.  Thanks for the drama.

The 10 GH models weren't sold til the end of November.  There's no way you could have been waiting 9 months.

You are completely ignorant.  Butterfly was late in development.  The rest of your fantasy is complete bullshit.  They've delivered more gear than any other vendor.  Their hardware is good.

The anit-BFL meme is old news dude.  They were late on chip development as are AMD, Intel and everybody else.  They've shipped over 45,000 miners and are one of the few firms shipping hardware from stock without a pre-order.  
@_date: 2013-09-25 23:11:32
BFL has shipped 3 generations of bitcoin mining gear and is currently powering a good portion of this crazy high hash rate.  Bash away, but them's the facts.

Weren't all these supposed to have been delivered in September?

Great project.  Misguided marketing.  You guys are going to get yourselves into trouble.

There's no drama like ASIC drama.  Who's got the microwave popcorn?

For those who don't know what this means...  this is a very good thing for bitcoin.  It gives significant players in the investment world an easy way to start getting involved in bitcoin.  To date there hasn't been a vehicle close to this.

I can understand that, but re-posting again and again is the definition of spam.  
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:35:26
Please stop spaming these BFL related posts.  We get it.  You don't like BFL.  Fine.  Enough is enough.

All mine work great and I've made my money back and then some.  If you paid in bitcoin and are sore that bitcoin went up, don't blame butterfly labs.  
If you've got a broken unit, just send it in for a replacement.  They stand behind their gear from what I've seen.

Buttcoin is a bitcoin parody site and that review isn't of an asic minirig.  It's of a prototype fpga unit from two years prior.  The FUD train from the asic wars has created a gigantic distortion field for any casual observer.

Weusecoins has posted in several places that they're interested in doing a new video.  They just need a script.  They didn't mention anything about needing funding.

This is a pretty good list of bitcoin mining hardware.  
@_date: 2013-10-08 02:12:17
BFL is the oldest and most successful of the bitcoin mining manufacturers.  They've made three consecutive generations of miners.  Nobody else has even come close.  Yes, they've been late but aside from the internet phenomenon of the anti bfl hate train, they're actually pretty damned good.  Go ahead and vote me to death, but it's true.

Avalon &amp; BFL started shipping a few pretty early...  it was the bulk shipments that seemed to suffer the majority of delay.  I expect KNC will ship something pretty quickly, but not much of it until they get their production up and going.

Thank you for the PSA, now will you please quit spamming reddit?
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:48:21
What miner are you using?   Are you worried about condensation on the electronics?
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:39:45
I've seen enough of these BFL spam threads, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:27:00
I don't understand what you're trying to say.  If you file a chargeback, it goes under review.  While it's in review, it appears as though you have the money but it's only pending the review result.  If you in fact did buy the product and the terms of purchase don't favor your chargeback claim, then the credit card company will then not give you money.  Is that what's happening?
@_date: 2013-09-26 16:07:09
The difference is that BFL's terms were 'all sales final'.  KNC's terms were 'we offer refunds up til we ship your product'.  So irrespective of BFL having been late, they didn't change their terms.  It appears as though KNC has.  There is a difference.

Awesome!  Kudos to WSJ for a positive story that doesn't dredge up the worst of the bitcoin mining slugfest.
