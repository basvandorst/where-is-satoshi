Maybe check your junk mail as we definitely sent a reply, in fact I sent it myself: 
We have now sent you through the original PDF but we have contacted Amazon and they have informed us it has been redeemed.
EDIT: Worth noting that the comment was edited after I had replied. My response to the new comment is that you opened two support threads with us, the screenshot you have is from the second thread. Our initial response was to the first support request you made.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:03:51
I mentioned in your other post that I will respond here. I work at Gift Off.
You first got in touch with us on Wednesday stating your problem and we replied asking for more details. You did not send the details we requested when you emailed yesterday, but we believe we have located the specific order in question.
We are currently looking into this issue with Amazon and appreciate your patience in the matter. I realise we haven't spoken to you in the last 24 hours whilst our investigations have been taking place and we apologise for that.
It is disheartening to see you say we are a scam simply because we didn't respond to an email within 24 hours. Please know we are doing our best to resolve this situation.
We are a small company and do not always man the phones - it is worth noting you did not leave a voicemail on our system though so we had no idea someone was calling so often.
We are unable to offer a refund since the code has been redeemed. Would you be able to double check the balance on your account? I suggest we move this conversation back to email support.

What does it mean that they are aware of Fold? Have they given express permission? Have they said it's a good thing? Is there a guarantee that buying through Fold will continue to work or is it at the whim of Starbucks choosing to disallow it?

@_date: 2014-05-04 16:10:53
A very good point. Whilst we are a startup in the UK and as such have only UK retailers currently, we intend to roll out across the EU as soon as possible allowing our large user base to drill down to retailers in their specific country.

Would only take one state to not like this and destroy it (fairly easy with a rocket or two?), an act in itself that would increase debris in the already congested LEO.
I just cannot see it as a viable approach to the problem of disseminating information freely. As someone has already mentioned, radio already tackles a lot of this, just less visually. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:47:18
We have 175 UK stores on  and a bunch of them sell watches: Amazon, H Samuel, Argento, Guest &amp; Philips (they have Rolex) to name a few!
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:23:19


Do you have a source on this? I asked Bitpay about guaranteeing payment to my account if a double spend occurred and they said they couldn't.
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:03:37
I mean did you just apply online, over the phone, special sit-down meeting with the banks? Did you actually mention the word bitcoin to them?
I'm just trying to gauge the bank sentiment at the moment and this would be a really helpful indicator for the whole community :)

Hi, thanks for the lovely review.
You will hopefully be pleased to know we are working with a number of stores in the ROI and should be rolling out gift cards specifically for Ireland soon.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:34:33
No worries, I thought maybe they had changed stance is all. I read it wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:10:38
I realise this is from some time ago but we now begin processing after just 1 confirmation :)

Not currently but it is something we are looking into.
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:24:08
Thanks for the feedback. Country-specific filter nearly ready to roll out, it definitely makes things easier.

I work at  - you can buy Steam cards that work worldwide from us whilst Valve don't yet offer this option.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:00:08
A fair point, there are a couple of places around where you can buy Steam games individually such as  (we are not affiliated with them in any way and I have no idea on how safe they are).
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:30:25
Do they know specifically that you are working as a bitcoin exchange service? Are you a registered UK company?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:50:35
We hope to expand that way in the future. As for the other question about sending to a friend this is something we are nearly finished with implementing and should roll out soon.
With regards to vouchers being tied to emails there are a couple of our cards that do this and we are reworking our interface so this is made clear prior to purchase (with the ability to choose an email address to tie it to). iTunes is not tied to an email address but it is tied to the UK.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:02:58
Please get in touch with support(at)pock.io and we can sort this out for you.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:30:17
Not particularly, we are more interested in showing support for the community. We started this service to support bitcoin and although it has grown we still support the community at our core.
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:57:00
You'd be surprised, there are a lot of exclusive ad spots for big companies on there which no doubt bring in five figures a year each. Gyft spend a lot, look at this subreddit for evidence of that, they're everywhere!

With the exception of ASDA or Marks &amp; Spencer's via pockio.

give them a chance at least, geez.
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:34:57
We are based in the UK and have only really launched to the UK market (for now at least). The cards have GBP denominations but will be converted to any local currency upon redemption. £10 is roughly 16 USD.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:56:44
Interesting, so how did you go about getting UK bank accounts for bitcoin as every other company that has tried has failed or has had to mask their true intentions for the account.

Spotify and Topman coming very shortly. Tesco is in the roadmap. Enjoy :)

Hello, I work for pock.io. You should check out feedback around the web if you are concerned about the site at all. Check out our [twitter feed]( a review on [CoinJoint]( We also have articles about us on a few websites including CoinDesk and PaymentsSource and if you search for us on reddit you'll find a load of happy people too :)
Hope this helps. If you need to speak any further you can find me on freenode IRC, username rustyn. Or email us. Or Skype us - you'll find all those details on our website alongside our company registration number, address and phone number.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:05:26
Agreed. I wonder why OP mentioned that since it is completely false.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:53:47
Currently the system awaits 6 confirmations, but we are changing this to zero confs over the next couple of weeks.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:43:08
Well they don't have to learn a lot about a QR code, just that it is scannable and is a way of payment. Just like I don't know how NFC works in my Debit card, I just magically wipe it in front of a terminal and I've paid.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:09:36
Where are you located?  is a site I am involved with in the UK which is about to roll out in key locations across the EU :)

also  which has even more gift cards :)

Don't worry, check out comment history, pure troll
edit; i a word
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:01:53
Thanks for pointing that out, it is fixed now. The devs have been ordered more coffee.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:00:59
I guess. Though you can encode a lot more information in a QR code and it can be decoded in any orientation, both useful features. As well as having error margins of up to 30%, unlike barcodes.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:50:03
Hello, I work at pockio.
We are in no way affiliated with purse.io and we are do not share a business model. Whilst they are a two-sided marketplace that is open to fraud we sell gift cards for over 170 retailers in the UK and EU.
If you do a search on reddit you will no doubt find a few of our thousands of customers sharing their experience with using pockio.
Hope this eases your mind!
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:24:29
I work at  We are in talks with the supermarkets (and more) about their digital offering and hope to be able to move this forward in the future.
Once a company gets into sending out physical cards a lot of issues can creep in (such as non-delivery, missing cards, wrong items shipped etc..) so we wanted to focus on providing a fool-proof, simple and rapid service.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:01:25
Great points!
The rate text you found should not have been live. We in fact use current exchange rates for GBP to EUR (for instance, at time of writing the rate is €1.3638678 to £1). Conversion to bitcoin is also using current exchange rates, in this case supplied by CoinDesk.
We have put out a fix that shows the non-UK cards better. We are always looking to improve our user journey, so thank you for highlighting this issue.
Hope this helps!

Firstly thanks to the other redditors for commenting here.
I work at Gift Off, formerly known as pockio. We have simply rebranded, everything else is the same - well, almost the same. We have added new cards, new currencies and speeded up the service, as well as giving the site a visual overhaul.
Apologies for your confusion. We did announce this in multiple places (reddit, social media, press releases, a big notice at the top of the site for a couple of weeks) and had people discuss the change on bitcointalk and it is just an unfortunate case that these flew under your radar.
Please enjoy the new site with the same old service!
@_date: 2015-10-09 13:54:09
It's an interesting product and something we have considered too, but when approaching large brands they were not happy about the reselling of cards in this manner.
I'd be interested to know what Starbucks thinks about your app (specifically about buying/reselling issued gift cards) and if that affects it's longevity?
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:05:16
Maybe even get fruity with the blockchain API and use this to keep it up to date -

Hello - there are a handful of cards that work worldwide at the moment (Click on All cards then flip the dropdown to Worldwide) but no specific Canadian ones unfortunately.
However, that should be changing in the future :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:09:34
Awesome, you beat me to posting this. We have undergone a rebrand and are working on some very exciting things to roll out through the rest of the year.
Thanks for being a customer, it's all of you who have enabled us to get this far and we'll be giving back to our community too :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:57:55
Bitpay does have this warning. It warns when you have underpaid and when you have overpaid. You can grab a full refund if you have underpaid (as the merchant will not have released goods) and you can request a partial refund if you have overpaid (and the merchant can continue as normal).
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:43:09
Give  a try :)

 supports Amazon already in the UK and will shortly be adding a lot more merchants
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:26:09
Thanks for your answers, I'm glad you didn't take my post as an attack as it was just feedback and the desire to understand further.  
  
Understanding the fees is really helpful too, I understand the charges now. As for the trading information, that's all a little over my head so I'll have to trust you there.  
  
My point on LocalBitcoins is more with regards to my own country, the UK. I don't have to pay any fees on SEPA or anything like that, I can transfer within minutes to another bank account in the UK and that is where I tend to purchase any Bitcoin.  
  
I saw your competition for the design, I would be interested but I don't design in Photoshop I tend to conjure up designs on the fly in CSS and bootstrap so don't match the criteria. Nevermind :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:53:20
Try  for Amazon.co.uk
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:00:09

@_date: 2013-11-21 22:28:09
From the CNBC source for that article:  
Correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that bitcoin was legal tender. The virtual currency has been confirmed as a financial instrument or "private money".  
  
Still, good news.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:43:04
Whilst it's great to have multiple places for trades I am not sure I understand what problems you are addressing with your site.  
  
You say that prices aren't competitive, but against what? If you mean between traders on that platform, they are pretty competitive. If against exchanges? Currently LocalBitcoins UK is around the price of Mt Gox.  
  
You mention that prices aren't related to the amount of coins someone is buying, but I am unsure why this is a problem? I also don't see why anyone would offer 'bulk discounts' if that's what you're suggesting.  
  
Then there is the pricing - you say you don't have a commission fee (0%) which is great. You charge a monthly amount for sellers, which is your choice too. But you have to pay up to 1% on escrow, which is included in LocalBitcoins fee, so essentially you are paying more to use your site.  
  
Thirdly, the site is rather poorly designed. That green! Design is a factor for conversion and, whilst you might have a good or not, design is going to be a factor that drives away at least my business.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:18:07
Well, it was news to me. Any news of Bitcoin in the media is a positive in my eyes, it's all about coverage and exposure.

As with many people here I am a web developer (PHP, jQuery, CodeIgniter, RESTful APIs, HTML5, bootstrap) who knows his way around WordPress and Magento too.
I am also an SEO consultant, primarily dealing with the technical aspect of things but also adept at online strategy. I provide these services not only to SMEs (love helping startups and local businesses) but also to large brands (in the UK thus far). I have a lovely copywriter on my books too, she produces excellent content for things. 
All of the above services I provide for fiat and bitcoin, though have not had anyone pay in BTC yet!
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:57:24
I would love to invite my friends if I didn't have my Bitcoin tied up in escrow due to non-paying buyers AND zero response to my support requests..
I realise you have a lot of users now but you charge for this service (which I have been more than happy to pay) but then leave me in the cold when I need some help.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:10:28
I have not used them personally, but I have started a competitor to all4btc called [Bitfest]( *UK only* for now but it does not charge the 5% fee that all4btc does. It is also a lot more intuitive than the all4btc sales process (in my opinion).  
  
I only launched on Thursday 5th December but have already completed many orders, some people have mentioned their luck with the service on At some point today I will be releasing an update to the site that allows you to just paste in the Amazon URL and choose to either have the goods sent to you, have the goods+shipping amount sent to you in the form of an Amazon gift card or you can just directly purchase Amazon gift cards through the site.
