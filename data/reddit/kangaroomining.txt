Btcandfreinds on YouTube is a good cartoon u might wanna check out. I trade price action support and resistance no it wont tell you what the price is but you can get a good indication of where its going and atleast what its doing. Some hodl some trade which takes learning. Depends how much time your willing to put in.

Your thought process of value and utility are wack, you need to rethink your approach as too what gives btc value, ... speculation and utility! Is the value

You used an unreputable exchange, why? Guess your learnt your lesson the hard way. Dont do it again. Use an exchange like binance , kraken, bitmex and bybit. They are the only trustable options imho. Just out of curiosity where are you from?
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:21:26
Welcome, a good place to start would be 
I would recommend sticking to the main exchanges - binance, kraken, bybit , bitmex , bitstamp, coinbase  and Coinspot if your in Australia.
I would also recommend you keep a history of anytrades you make as you will need to pay tax. 
Makes life easier if you keep a history of all transactions when you go to do your tax. If you want use cointracker or similar it will keep a history of your trades automatically through api access, dont worry it only has read only access which means it can only see your trades not withdraw or trade from your account. Keep history and backups of passphrases and keys if you ever need to restore a wallet and keep multiple of these, better yet get a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor.

Whatever the buyer is willing to pay and the seller is willing to sell for is the realistic price at any given time, its called speculation and that is what makes the realistic price. Supply and demand my friend.
