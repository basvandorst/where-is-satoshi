No alts ever again?  That's a big assumption that BTC is the only one that'll make it...
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:52:26
First of all, not all alts are rising, second, not all are shit coins.......  Ethereum a shit coin bro?  Ether makes btc look like shit for all technical reasons. The ONLY thing btc has on Ether is the supply and demand, the "main player" status.  And luckily for btc, lightning will solve the biggest problem it has as a payment system.
But btc isn't even TRYING to do what ether is doing.

Yeah but your comment is basically "If he had just done the right thing instead of the wrong thing, he'd have done it right!"
Nobody knows the bounces and trends.  People are pretty sure it'll trend up over time, but nobody knows how the dips will be.  Wow, I lost 1btc total in a liquidation the way he's talking, and felt shitty.  Have bills to pay.  But it seems to be the bottom of the trend now. 
But I learned my lessons.  No more day trading on margin, no more leaving positions.  I also was liquidated on because my point of liquidation MOVED.  My margin wallet had coins, the coins lost value, so my position on btc was effected.  BTC never dropped to 8k which was my margin price when I wen to sleep (I was longing it, knowing it'll go back up eventually)
When I woke up, liquidated at 10k, because my coins lost money, my margin wallet lost money, and the point of liquidation increased.
Holy fuck this story scared me but made me realize I could have made it sooo much worse
Also made me realize that holy shit, when I get to a million dollars, I'm cashing out half!  WTF!  Even if he's great at day trading, take some profit out!  I'm back to EVEN (with credit card debt :( ) but now I know to hodl, that's where I made the profits, and ignore the day trading, because for every good trade, made 4 bad trades, and even this guy with 300 btc was bamboozled by the trends.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:55:10
... only if you buy more, and only if it goes back up.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:47:29
Why don't you believe it then?  Sounds reasonable.  I had a position liquidated and learned my lesson, however.  Never again trading on margin and leaving open positions in a volatile market.
I fully believe this, especially if he left an open position as early as 1k, rode it out most the way to 19k, margined at 10x, that alone is 190x profit already, he said he closed a few times on the way up.
Then, he margined WAY too much and tried to play the bounces.  I did the same, lost about 1btc and it hurt.  Can't imagine this.

IF HE KNEW THAT
nobody knew when the dip starts. Nobody knows if it's a dead cat bounce or still dipping.  Nobody knows how low ti'll be pushed.
So all the critique about "doing it right" is very useless, because in hindsight the way to do it right would be buy 5 years ago!  It's so obvious! 
 but the advice about how much to bet, only margin trade 5%, hodl the rest, etc, this is good advice.

Sadly, I hope not... poor vegeta, all that training in the hyperbolic chamber. 
Wait for 90,000
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:18:05
Yeah, who would possibly come up with a use for a tamper proof, censor proof, redundant and world wide form of payment and currency where you hold the keys and nobody else??
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:24:00
I see so much criticism from people that are obviously unaware that in many parts of the world, crypto is taking off in regular life.  Just not in the USA, so people declare it "useless" and "nobody uses it"
shit, segwit and lightning are already live to use, and will be common soon, atomic swaps coming soon, other chains with faster transactions and cheaper transfer....
I can't believe that I have to defend btc in the fucking bitcoin subreddit.
But it MAY NOT BE BITCOIN that is the long running crypto. It has first mover advantage, got big and popular and brought people in, like AOL.  and if it fails to modify itself, fails to keep improving, it'll fail like AOL.
Did the internet die with AOL?  Did the dot com bubble burst put an end to that silly "internet that will change our lives"?
Fuck no, the internet changed our lives MORE AFTER the dot com bubble burst than before!  The survivors of that crash became bigger than all the lost assets of the bubble
As in, if 90% of the crypto burst and are worthless, nobody is buying them on any exchange.  Those coins and their teams either stop working on them, or run away, or can't get any support, etc.  BTC itself maybe is in the shitter.  The 10% remaining will rebuild into something bigger than the current state of crypto
You know why? Because decentralized, people powered systems that take the keys from the corporations and banks and give them back to the people are the future.
The entire internet and everything we do to communicate, share, watch, study, in addition to just pay, can (and should, and I say will) become decentralized and partially democratic.  We'll see more of the source code.  We'll hold more of the keys.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:15:37
and use.  and trade decentralized and in person.

Uh, or they helped a bunch of people sell short on btc, and it was great business, and now they're advertising that they can help you make money on btc, whether its up or down.
I'm pretty sure they planned both the advertisement and the dip.
dip =!= bubble burst.  As one person said, what did you expect a ride to 100k with no dip?  It could even be the 2 year 1k to 200 dip, but with this much more money in it, probably not that long.

Yes, and I think that coinbase, and other crypto companies, will get the regulation necessary for this.
In fact I think coinbase IS FDIC insured...

segwit, lightning, rai blocks....
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:28
lol, first of all, yes they are, second of all, Asia is the biggest adapter (not talking china, but china is big, and even with the "ban" they'll be big adapters) It's huge in Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Philipines, Thailand.... It's picking up in Europe...
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:28:16
what?? decentralized storage, chat, websites, money transfer, gaming systems, item trading on games, smart contracts..... 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:26:46
btc is still btc, a fork and an alt are not a copy..... it's not "making more" or "making it less scarce"
that's like saying gold became less scarce when we invented fake gold, gold plating, and found fools gold.......
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:58:48
Now i get why people call lightning "centralization" of btc, which I guess isn't too big an issue as long as btc is the "main hold of value" in crypto, because you can use other coins most the time, or for purposes of secrecy.
However, does segwit have 'centralization' issues?  How does it effect this aspect?
How about atomic swaps?  Is this basically through other blockchains interacting together with btc blockchain?
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:49:07
good to know!
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:00:35
That's fucking annoying I had been sending from coinbase, why would they use a fee for that but not their exchange?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:47:40
definitely people lost money.  just because it's going up, doesn't mean people make money. There's betting on margin, putting it into alts at the wrong time, mis managing it.
