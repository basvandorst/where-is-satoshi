The point is casting your vote and letting non-miners have a voice. We need 95% miner consensus not node consensus. But if non SW miners don't have any transactions to mine I bet we get a consensus a lot faster

I can learn to count cards and play perfect black jack but I'm still gambling. At the end of the day investing IS gambling. You can do all the research you want but there will always be a level of uncertainty or chance. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:40:37
Huh? I don't understand. I get why people flock to bitcoin. The fact remains you're still gambling on global instability. You're also assuming that bitcoin will continue to be the one people flock to. It could easily be any other alt coin or even some coin not developed between now and then.

How do you r commend we buy coins then?

Thanks for the recommendation. I'll give it a shot. I can definitely say to stay away from Coinbase

Can anyone comment on whether it actually takes a whole month to sync and download the blockchain on a RPI? I have about 150mbps down so downloading the chain takes no time at all but will verifying it really take weeks?

Bots probably

What makes you think he isn't smart enough to understand bitcoin? I mean, he's been pretty successful if you ask me. I'm not saying he's Einstein but I think people underestimate him and that's how we ended up where we are now.

Umm. Everyone is complaining that the reporters were being mean but they are just being enthusiastic and trying to make it exciting and sell a story. At no point were they really rude imo.

Does Coinbase count as an exchange? It seems to be rather well trusted around here. Is it okay to purchase a few coins on CB then move them to cold storage periodically?
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:26:57
I get why you think that, but in my limited experience I've seen the prices of both rise and fall together.

But then you're paying for food so still paying for energy in the end.

You're speculating that some random person on Reddit sold his bitcoin and made the price fluctuate like 80 USD? Is that what you're insinuating?

I wonder what the theoretical maximum number of times a meme can be reposted before it's unrecognizable is? Surely all download, compression, etc sources of entropy can be accounted for and calculated right? We need @_date: 2017-01-19 17:57:09
Did you find that the long sync time was because the PI is slow to verify blocks? I assume there is some SHA hashing that the PI is slow to do?
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:38:29
Well part of the reason is he block chain data is over 100GB on bitcoin core. That's 10% of my monthly data limit from ISP. For others they might even have less. That being said, I run two nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:10:45
Pretty naive to think he wouldn't understand it don't you think?
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:44:28
Yep, had money in a USD wallet just waiting to buy when the price inevitable corrected.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:34:35
Fair enough. In any case I find all this meta discussion highly childish. Can't we all just get along? :D

It would have to be stellar but yes I'd pay up to &amp;5-$10 if it really kicked butt.
