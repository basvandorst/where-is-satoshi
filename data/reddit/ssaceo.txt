This is a wise move. But as far as everyone just using a VPN now, that might still put them in violation of US law. It's an open question to what extent a casino needs to go to block Americans. 
My take on SD's move is that it doesn't have to do with gambling compliance as most casinos or players would understand it. In terms of gambling law, SD's legality would probably need to be looked at on a state-by-state basis in terms of whether or not the actual sending and receiving of Bitcoins constitutes an unlicensed lottery or numbers racket. On a Federal level, UIGEA doesn't apply since that law only deals with sending money through the US banking system or financial instruments. 
But Federal law _does_ prohibit the operation, marketing or promotion of interstate lotteries.
"According to the Federal Lottery Law, it is illegal to operate a lottery through the mail or over the telephone. A lottery exists when you must pay for a chance to win a prize. **The prize could range from money to jewelry or a new car. The chance means an opportunity to win, such as a drawing or a matching lucky number. Consideration means some sort of payment by you.** [emphasis mine.] If all three elements of payment, chance, and prize are present, it's a lottery. Federal statutes prohibit, among other things, the mailing or transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of promotions for lotteries or the sending of lottery tickets themselves."
