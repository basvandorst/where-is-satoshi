Absolutely, companies are afraid from back customer reviews, and also liquidity is hard to manage with such a volatile currency at hands.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:26:31
There is still a long way to go, in order for everyone of us to be confident in using crypto. Lets walk it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:10:02
Everyone should be doing this. But having transaction pass slow is terrible for conducting business.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:45:19
It wouldn't never be such, even if bitcoin loses some of its popularite it would reduce the price, but open mined people would buy the reduced in value commodity, and make it scarce to the masses, thus making it rise once more. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:36:54
Thank you! Take it as personal and as me being part of a community thanks!

When you look into blockchain as a technology, let alone crypto currencies, you start seeing such potential. I can only imagine what the world would be in 10 years from now.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:38:09
That's how it is supposed to work, once you get money to invest it goes up, and once you buy in it goes down.

He cant do anything, if he insists on trying don't forget that EMPs are a very real thing, with a very concrete consequences.

I recently helped my dad with buying not only some crypto, but he also shows interests in ICOs.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:01:32
Don't worry, see you again at the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:05:36
That's like having a Green Peace official answering questions of the As and Bs of oil rigging.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:38:01
That's how it is supposed to work, once you get money to invest it goes up, and once you buy in it goes down.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:45:49
Yep, and sadly it is unavoidable.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:09:13
This sounds more like a marketing campaign, with hopes to popularize the growing crypto hype-train. Still It would be cool to see bitcoin being accepted into more and more mainstream spots.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:41:05
$30 for a transaction, you ought to sell some very expensive luxury goods in order to do sales via bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:40:12
It will definitely make a global change, but the conventional fiscal system is a tough nut to crack.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:15:54
Hehe its always the point of  entry, that Is of relevance to you. I entered at 6k and I'm still pretty happy with over 100% return, but others my be panicking a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:07:54
Its always the little spark of hope that has kept great ideas in their period of genesis, and that little spark of hope in our case has been provoked by immense amount of greed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:48:10
So he is passively admiring it while actively fearing its potential? I can see him turning to bitcoin in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:53
Be ready for the huge dump that's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:22:03
So are you implying that bitcoin is a privately owned institution holding the monopoly of the worlds most mainstream currecy, and instead of backing it up with equity, it is all built on liability? I doubt that its the same but ok.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:07:43
Haha, I last bought at 6k, and sold at 11k. I am done with holding bitcoin for  now because I am furnishing my new apartment, ill be back soon I hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:07:14
Japan has it right,  I can only hope the rest of the worlds healthy economies get the point and follow the revolution.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:14:33
Its not practical, it would only be practical if it is the only currency we are using, than we would not worry about the fluctuations. For example the $ is constantly fluctuating, but nobody worries because it is the median itself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:24:52
That's rather unrelated mate. If you make money out of something, where is the justification to be ripped off for something else?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:42
Its the same cost to pass a 1 ETH transaction as it is to pass a 500 ETH one. At that point adding a % to the equation is even worse than the contemporary bank system we have, the same banking system because of which crypto currencies emerged in the first place. So please save me your nobility about being cool with paying 1.5% fee. How could any crypto become mainstream this way? With percentages this high we are talking about half-life, not mere fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:34:23
I love that idea. All hail the new crypto related disorder we all are so fond of.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:10:44
This is very tricky and could go both directions, either it will be a good thing and it would lead to developing a steady growth, due to increase in reliability and trust, or we could end up in the same fucked up economy we currently have.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:57:36
It is not overprices, its just a scarce resource that people want to buy, and have a limited amount of it tends to pump prices up in direct correlation with the popularity.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:00:24
This is the way how we as humans work. Nothing uncommon and anything that is likely to ever stop. 
"I remember arguing with my friend when I was a child, about who's dad's car was better. Apperantly both of our dads had Audi A6 with the exact same face. Didn't matter because my dad's car was cooler because it was black and his dad's audi was silver."
I never really stop bragging and bashing all the "lesser" its just that we get better at hiding our huge egos.
So to answer your question- No we wont stop insulting, not because of anything else but due to us being humans.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:31:49
So we exceed the actual too positive to be true forecast for the year we had.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:02:58
It is really cool, but it is really old as well. Still only shows us how little people know about it in general. Time to start educating I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:09:34
Who knows, years ago when it all began, people were warning that after it peaks at 200-300 the bubble will burst. Look at where we are at now. One thing is for sure, it is only the beginning of a beautiful financial revolution.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:49:35
People feel uncertain, due to lacking knowledge. And the people who have good understanding know the risks and feel hesitant into buying hard into bitcoin. And you are left with the middle section that is mostly involved. No matter how technically competent you are there financial aspects that bare risk, which unfortunately very few people understand.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:33:05
Since it is decentralized, any crypto coin depending on its popularity is a possible safe heaven for people to keep their money safe in time crisis, if this happens then we will see sky rocketing prices of bitcoin for sure and possibly etherium.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:55:18
Welcome to the real world, people were buying houses In Detroit in 2007, imagine them two years later.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:01:52
If that really does happen, we are anticipating quite a nice dip, which would later spark an even greater peak. Makes you venturous.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:00:33
Actually I am just sharing the link, because I saw it shared on Facebook, and figured that some people might want to watch it, I heard that questions will be answered.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:00:07
We are witnessing the birth of a whole industry, that is to surpass many others.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:41:00
Once it becomes part of the culture it will be impossible to reverse it. This is the best way to secure the existence of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:54:29
Rather interesting. I be any cold place with running water could labeled the best spot with ease.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:18:01
Well it is only worth if you hold it as a long term investment. So technically you could suffer some short term loss, but in the end it is a totally different aim you need to have, so in other words -yes.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:28:35
I will try something fancy. I will hodl most of my funds, but try and play with some I feel like  sparing. I wont call it gambling, because I have developed  a strategy to abide by.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:55:33
This is rather interesting, and if it in fact is not a scam its rather cool to be real. This is the way how things should advance.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:31:54
It is a problem, but there is nothing you could do about it. For as long as no-one exceeds 51% it is totally fine.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:52:45
Buy now, but there is always a chance of unseen consequences. No body has the right answer to those question prior to something happening, so just do what you'd consider right. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:28:39
We shall persevere! Once we were told that $100 would be the absolute peak of a popular bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:49:42
I didn't know that either, by the way, do you think that increasing the amount would potentially reduce the fees?
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:43:27
This is rather in the area of conspiracy, because of these fluctuations is tied to a social, technical, political, economical and financial factors each of which bearing a certain amount of fault for the  current popularity, value etc. It is impossible to take all the factors that have an impact, thus having any sort of forecast regarding the long term future of any crypto currency is the least speculation.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:24:06
Makes you wonder, when exactly are they going to add it into textbooks as a milestone of human ingenuity.
