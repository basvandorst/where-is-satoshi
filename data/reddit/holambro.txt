Trust me, You're not alone. Although I was lucky to get 0.005 BTC from an ATM a few weeks ago.
Give me your address and I'll send you half. I need the experience of making a payment with my wallet :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:16:34
Thank you. Now I get it. That was the explanation I've been seeking. 
For all intents and purposes, it does appear to me a real flaw in the protocol that someone can change some details of a transaction without invalidating it and without access to the private key of the sender of the money. Shouldn't be possible if you ask me.

Who is going to put their Bitcoin in a "risky" project, when all they need to do is sit back and wait for the moooooon?

I am waiting for account verification since nov. Sent them an email 4 weeks ago and just got a response today that they can't handle the load and will process everything on a first come first serve basis.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:07:11
Sent. 0-confirmations so far, but I'm sure it worked. 
EDIT: confirmed!

You might be able to find TM attempts if you had copies of enough orphaned blocks, but I doubt many people keep copies of those.
Maybe an idea going forward though.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:41:43
Oh wow! That's awesome. Thank you so much.  :-D

Not with a population of 41 million, mostly very poor, people. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:14:37
Too many decimals. Not enough integers. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:31:39
Hmmm. 5 years * 365 * 10 = $18,250.  That green line doesn't appear to go higher than $10k.

I don't expect the government to try to ban it. It would be hard to justify legally anyway. However, if they come to see bitcoin as undesirable, I expect them to put pressure on banks and payment processors to make it difficult to exchange bitcoin for fiat and vice versa. Similar to what they did with Wikileaks donations.
Such a move could make bitdoin less attractive, but the world is bigger than just the US and Istrongly believe that bitcoin is here to stay. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:18:45
This appears to be some kind of computer glitch. The movements clearly don't add up to the change in balance, so there's obviously something amiss. I don't know this exchange, but if you trusted them enough to have so much money with them, I wouldn't panic just yet. 
A lot of companies dealing with cryptocurrencies have been overwhelmed by the ballooning interest, so they may well be understaffed and unable to respond quickly.
I would try to find a telephone number and see if you can get somebody on the phone there.
Good luck and I hope for you it gets resolved quickly.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:02:56
Thanks for finding that. 
I hope Andreas fixes his comments on this. It hurts his credibility, while he is so spot on with his entire analysis and explanation of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:41:23
No chance. It would end up being just a copy of Bitcoin. They wouldn't have any more control over it than Satoshi has over Bitcoin.
If they were to create a cryptocurrency that they can exercise control over (i.e. not a Bitcoin clone) than nobody would trust / use it.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:09:50
You insist I do the actual math?
130,000 / (365 + 285) = 200
How does that differ from a few hundred and more than a year?
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:31:51
You're late to the game. Now that you finally made the leap, it is bound to crash tomorrow. 
Don't suckle over it. It is just faith. Like whenever you remember to take your umbrella. Then it never rains. /f
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:14:29
10 business days to get verified. Application filed Dec 5. Still waiting. Guess they're overwhelmed :(
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:11:07
A bitcoin transaction is just like a cash transaction. No need for special measures to avoid tax evasion. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:33:10
You could well be right. 
But your math is wrong:
$100M for BTC 107,309 = $931.89 per BTC. Not unthinkable.
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:43:06
This guy gives great presentations and really understands Bitcoin in depth. 
I am sceptical about his claim of only 1bn people in the world with access to banking though. When I add up the populations of the US, Europe and Brazil; countries that I know pretty much everybody has access to banking facilities, that's almost 1bn right there. Than there is SE Asia, Japan, the middle east, the rest of the Americas, Russia. I would think that the number should be at least double what he claims. I have no sources though, so I could be wrong.

While its true that these pool administrators have a lot of power, they are limited in what they can do because they don't control most of the hardware. Miners would be very quick to switch to other pools if any of them tried to pull a fast one here. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:50:47
Get out of here!
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:31:34
I wouldn't worry about that too much. At some point - not so far in the future - the price will begin to stabilize. After all, it can't continue to rise forever. I'm sure there will be volatility in the process, but somewhere the ceiling will become apparent. Once that happens, hoarding bitcoins is no longer worth it and the frozen fortunes will become liquid. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:38:29
The difference appears to be too large for this to result from just the spread in rates, but in principle this is how a lot of professional traders make money: buy something in a market where the price is low and instantly sell it in a market where the price is higher. Of course, when enough people do this, the prices in the divergent markets are pushed towards each other, until there is no more profit to be made.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:01:02
With a total value of several billion dollars in dedicated hardware already mining Bitcoin, I think that such an attack is already beyond their ability. 
50%+ is only the theoretical lower limit for a succesful attack, but to really disrupt the network long term, one needs to control a much higher percentage. Possibly as much as 75%..85%.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:18:37
I like that idea. I've been thinking about doing something similar for my cookies, but wasn't sure how to go about it. 
Question though: how do people send you their shipping address? Is it done by including a message with the payment? Doesn't that expose people? I thought those messages end up in the blockchain, or are they encrypted and only readable to the person/wallet they were sent to?

first they ignore us,
then they laugh at us,
then they fight us,
then we win.
Is this guy in the laughing stage or in the fighting stage? I couldn't stay concentrated on his incoherent babble.

As Andreas states, the poorer the country, the higher the fees. I can attest to that. Source : I live in Brazil and have used WU a number of times to send money to Europe. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:51:02
Hate to break it to you, but you are soooo out of luck. 
Feel sorry for you, but you should have been more careful.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:47:29
I didn't quite get that. You mean Coinbase failed to execute your transaction, or your credit union?
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:38:23
I have been wondering this as well. If the banks pull together and refuse to do business with the exchanges, getting fiat money into and out of the system is going to be a serious problem. And I have the impression that that is exactly the direction in which we are heading. 
I don't see an effective way around this either. 
EDIT: deleted extra word.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:56:14
Well, that's not the case for the US and Europe and in Brazil most people are paid through bank transfer. Banks are required by law to offer simple checking accounts for free. I'd be surprised if Canada, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia would be much different. That's already well over 1bn right there. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:01:45
I'm certainly no expert, so I could be wrong here. From what I can tell though, the chart you reference is for nr of bitcoindays destroyed. That is the number of coins moved times the nr of days those coins have been idle. So it could easily be just a few hundred coins that have been sitting in a wallet for over a year.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:10:45
True, but they all know where to find the local LAN-house.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:59:45
Mr. Stross is right on all points he makes, but apart from the 'carbon footprint', which I believe is a non-issue in the global scale of things, every point he makes is either already true for other currencies, or positive for society, rather than negative. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:58:55
Yeah, I'm a little bummed seeing the price climb again, but I can't deny that I would have bought in at $900 if given the opportunity, so I shouldn't complain. Really wish I could've gotten on board yesterday though.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:15:35
I don't think so. I just sent €300 through PayPal to my daughter in Europe. By the time she had the money in her bank account it had shrunk to €285. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:51:19
Obviously not.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:18:28
I didn't expect a slide this far. Thank you MTGox for taking forever to get me verified.

@_date: 2013-12-10 18:47:46
Sorry, off topic, but can someone please ask cnet to stop forcing me onto their spanish website? I'm in Brasil, where the language isn't even Spanish but Portuguese. But that's besides the point, the pop-up that asks me if I want the Spanish website can't be closed. All I can do is load the Spanish site. It's been like that for weeks and its fucking annoying. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:37:38
Also the current hashrate equates to a value in devoted hardware of several billion dollars, while this thing is only just starting. 
I think it highly unlikely that the amount of computer power will drop much, if anything, below what it is today. Attacks on the network are thus more of a theoretical thought exercise than a real threat.
