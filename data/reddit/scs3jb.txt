The gambling industry call the lottery "a tax on the stupid", its literally the worst thing you can do with your money.  With that in mind, bitcoin is a much better use for that money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:30:13
The average fee is 0.256 USD today:
Let's say that's an average fee of 0.00008 BCH.
If the value of BCH reaches bitcoin today:
0.00008 BTC = 1.40 USD
Fees will increase relative to fiat, as the value increases relative to fiat. I suspect it will be higher because when BCH has the same load as bitcoin (or more), then there will be more competition for being placed in a block.
I think it would be fair to say, it would be between 10 USD and 1.40 USD fees, i would air on the side of under 3 USD if bitcoin becomes more and more popular.
Much better than BTC, but not 1 cent.  I think you'd probably be waiting a long time for a 1c to confirm, I certainly wouldn't submit a transaction like that without replaceable fees.  :)
Unless i'm missing something?
edit: median would be lower, of course, but its already over 1 c, I would expect to increase with inflation against fiat.

My Spanish isn't so good, but the same laws apply here, and I believe the states and Canada.  You can get a criminal record for this.
Please provide evidence that it is legal to spend assets you receive through error or fraudulently.  I am curious why you believe it is morally or criminally okay to do.
Again I am not talking about getting away with it or your own moral compass, but it is wrong to spread the information that spending money that is not yours is in any way legal.  Be it 10 euros you find in the street, money that arrives in your account, dividends from shares your bank accidentally trades, a property you don't own, or bitcoins sent to the wrong address.  To claim otherwise is false.
I am not sure why this is surprising to five redditors, surely your own ethics and morals twitch on this matter and most law is based on the common good.
Again, what you believe is not what I am stating, I am stating it is in fact illegal to spend assets you do not own lawfully.

Theft is theft; if you spend money you find or aquire accidentally this is illegal.  This applies in most western countries and law afaik, certainly UK and Spain.  The individual is liable not the bank.
The process is:
1. Report finding the money to the police
2. Wait for someone to step forward
3. After x period of time if the money has not been claimed, you can claim it.
Bitcoin is not exempt from this, if you use anything that is not yours lawfully you are a thief.  Of course, individual morals and honesty play a factor.
rule: if its not yours, don't spend it and report it.

Firstly, your wallet is encrypted so you would need to leave your phone unlocked and the wallet without a password or pin.  I am not sure of a single wallet that allows you not to set a pin but let's pretend it exists.  There is usually a spend PIN too.  Again, let's pretend that's not set.  So assuming your phone is unlocked, your bitcoin wallet is unencrypted. You would only lose what you had in that wallet, and if you are keeping a substantial sum on a phone, without a pin or encrypted, I think you can be classified as a bit of a fiscal plonker don't you think?  
Otherwise, you go home and enter your seed then move your funds to a new wallet.  All you lost is your phone really.
1. Set a pin.
2. Use multiple wallets, don't keep everything in a single place.
3. Store your seed carefully.
All that said, I find spending BTC quite stressful as if you do make a mistake, you lose your money and it's not reversible.  For small card like purchases it's not a big deal, but moving large wallets is a stressful time for me.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:04:48
Plebs usually go along for the ride without realising.  Dipshit Dave from the council estate can hop on without knowing when the banks use their own fake crypto behind the curtains.
I think you are arguing on the trade offs between economic freedom and as-is as if you can have everything when you talk about credit cards.  You want economic freedom, then you take the risk, otherwise you entrust yourself to a central entity.
I am sure there will be second layers, where transactions can be reversed but this sits on top of the reconciliation on the ledger.  This will be optional, just as lightning is optional.
The future will have both, but because of the openness and the optionality, hopefully it will drive the banks kicking and screaming to a better place.
I see in the future, banks hosting your wallet if you want to give up trust, as well as lightning/second layer where retailers buy into the trust and it gets written to the Blockchain after a 'trust period'.  We aren't there yet.

Indeed.  We live in an age where Mossad can crack your RSA encryption by listening to the CPU noise, it tends to center you on just enough effort to be implausible / difficult to deter most.
As of yet, it is implausible and requires physical access to crack these hardware devices.  When you access through Linux, then malware vectors are reduced.
Very likely, someone will have car batteries hooked up to your nipples and your balls in a vice to get you to unlock the encryption.  This is much easier.

 I'm not sure why you believe it is disrespectful in any way?  Did he ask people to stop doing it?  I don't ever recall him doing so.  If not, respect has nothing to do with associating him with Satoshi and if anything, it is actually quite the opposite and pure flattery.
The Iraqi information minister said there were no troops in Baghdad, for example, would it be disrespectful to speculate that they were if there were conflicting claims?  He had a motive not to do it, but ultimately he didn't care if you believed him or not, he just didn't want to suffer the consequences.
Anyway, if he has asked people to stop and he is Satoshi, then it would indeed be a sign of respect to not do it.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:46:11
"But it was this mystery guy, look his ip and sentence structure is different."  
The narrative that he sent a transaction to himself is sound.
His defence was "it can't be me because I received the first transaction from this guy".  Doing a transfer between two wallets you own is trivial, so in no way proves they are different people.  I think if you take the view that he is proving he isn't Satoshi; sending a transaction to yourself makes it less stupid, no? 
Remember, the theory was that Satoshi was a fake second identity for HAL, so if he was already sending fake emails to himself, making fake blog posts, etc. he would of course send fake transactions to himself to further solidify this.
All plausible, and sending a fake transaction to yourself makes sense to keep up the charade.
I'm not saying Hal is Satoshi for sure (although he seems the most likely candidate) I am just saying to the contrary, sending the first transaction to himself does more to prove it is him than dispute it.

Now if you elaborate, for example Bitcoin did not force a consensus split on its main fork to cover a hack that shows a massive amount of centralisation and control, then that holds some weight, but leaving it unanswered makes you sound salty.

The issues with being that confident are all the coincidences about the timeline around Hal and Satoshi, I can understand subscribing to the theory they are two different entities, but could never be 100% convinced. There's too much circumstantial evidence that Hal was indeed Satoshi, or one of the largest elements if it were a group:
* Visible in a space that wasn't huge
* "Communication" with Satoshi before and after bitcoin release
* Coded most of the early bitcoin stuff
* Neighbour with the exact name
* Degenerative disease that matches the slow disappearance of Satoshi
* Untimely and unfortunate death and the complete disappearance of Satoshi at the same time.
I can see him emailing himself, it makes sense and is a great defence against the feds sniffing around.   When you do this, you purposely change your tone, spelling, etc.  Someone as paranoid as the cipherpunk set would definitely be sending false emails to themselves.  I would have proxied to a web server, that had a vpn to a tor node if i were minting my own currency and was a US citizen.  
I'm pretty sure the private keys are gone from the eden blocks, Hal didn't back them up, his relatives didn't get the instructions to recover them, or they decided they simply didn't need the hassle.  I can understand all of them, the last would have been a big amount of hassle for the family when the feds turn up.
No way near 100% convinced of this, but so far its the best working theory of the identity that fits.  If someone turned round, that had matches on the above (ie. visibility, contribution, explanation/circumstance) then i could be easily convinced, but I'd expect them to sign a message with a private key from that first year if not the eden wallet.  A scammer would be unknown, appear out of nowhere and be unable to sign a message.
When it becomes a group, the issue is that conspiracy falls apart.  The more people involved, the more likely a leak.

Transactions levels now are way below what they were in December.  Don't be under any illusion that fees would have been acceptably low in December because of segwit alone.  There's a fee issue that will reoccur as adoption increases and the mempool fills.

My understanding is that for this to work, when you plug in the compromised ledger with the fake firmware, the malware on your pc will send a fake transaction you need to confirm (just like any send, etc action) which gives access to the ledger.  It sounds like it would be like if you were sending funds, you click yes or no to confirm the transaction, just like if you did a send.
Lot of people flipping out but that's what it sounds like.  Seems very difficult to achieve, you would need to be specifically targeted or the hacker would need to get you to install something like having fake software install disk in the box that loads some malware.

I actually think its counted as capital gains in most countries, so its usually substantially less than income tax.   Your crypto is like a share deal and will be taxed as captial gains along with all other things in that bracket.

It's agree, it's the ledger apps using remote APIs I suspect.  Anyone?

Do not be under the illusion the fee reduction is solely because of segwit.  The reason fees are down are because of mempool has significantly less transactions.  This issue of high fees will reoccur when transaction volumes increase.

I guess you used to talk about Bitcoin a lot? ;-)
