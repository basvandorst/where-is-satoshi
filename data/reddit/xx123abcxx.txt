**Real-time analysis of the 2018 Crypto Crash — PART 2**
In the event of the bounce failing to meet the aforementioned targets, a short position is ordered at $10912 with a hedge (i.e. not a stop-loss) at $11650 on BTC/USD (Bitfinex).
Possibly next wave down may be commencing?

Expecting a sideways choppy movement over the weekend whilst bulls &amp; bears alike take stock of what has been a volatile week.
And then, expecting a flush down to approx $7338/$7600/$8061 ($7666 on average) commencing next week.
Not to be taken literally, guesswork for entertainment purposes only! 
Bounce has arrived within the first target zone area; i.e. $12295/$13242 ($12768 average).
The short position limit order at $10912 was not activated, and hence has been cancelled.
Once sufficient enough waves have formed to suggest an end to the bounce, shall endeavor to post an update if not asleep.
Bounce over?
Barring any subdividing of waves; i.e. nested fractals; there appears to be enough waves to suggest the bounce may be complete.
Should the bounce be complete at $12746, it would have come within a mere $22 of the average $12768 projection.
Ordered a short position at $12244 and another at $11534 with stop-losses on both at $12746 (BTC/USD Bitfinex). 
Goodnight. 
Bounce continuing higher with the low and average upside potential met and exceeded; i.e. $12295/$13242 ($12768 average) on BTC/USD (Bitfinex).
Short positions set overnight were not activated, and subsequently have been cancelled.
Awaiting further development of waves to determine when to initiate new parameters of a new short position.
Short position ordered at $12485 with a stop-loss at $13017 on BTC/USD (Bitfinex).

As previously observed, the structure of declining a-b-c wave formations at lower degrees (i.e. Minute and Minor degrees) have been creating golden ratio relationships; where the length of the c-wave being 0.618 times the length of the a-wave; i.e.
Should this relationship between waves continue to unfold at a higher degree, then the larger Major degree a-b-c structure (black labels) forming since 08-JAN-2018 may complete at $8060.1; i.e.
Also, observed:
—At $8061, wave-c equals wave-a in length of the larger a-b-c Cycle degree (cyan labels) structure.
—At $7599, represents a 61.8% decline of the entire Bitcoin market.
The average of these three price points (i.e. $8060.1/$8061/$7599) is $7907 —the target of the short position opened at $12485.
With gains of +15% thus far, the short position from $12485 remains active with a stop-loss at $13017.
Target range remains at ($8061/$7599) $7907 on average for an additional 25% gain.

Additional short trade setup ahead of the CME futures 26-JAN-2018 expiration as follows:
BTC/USD (COINBASE)
OPEN = 11146
CLOSE = 8065
STOP = 11690
RISK = 4.9%
REWARD = 28%
Interesting to note that every Sunday in 2018 thus far has seen the start of a sell-off averaging in 28% declines over the next 4 days.

Time for a bounce? A speculative buy order has been placed as follows...
BTC/USD (BITFINEX)
OPEN: 8600
CLOSE: 12058 
STOP: 7960*
RISK: 7.5%
REWARD: 40%
*A hedge, not a stop-loss has been placed at 7690 as there may be a final flush to 7600 area.
Barring any wave subdivisions, there are now a sufficient count of waves to suggest the first Primary a-wave of the crash is over.
The a-wave decline from 06-JAN-2018 ought to be retraced by a b-wave bounce retracing up to 38.2% (11510) to 50% (12606) with the average being at 12058.
Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior, Robert Prechter:
*"b-waves — b-waves are phonies. They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of oddlotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both). They often involve a focus on a narrow list of stocks, are often 'unconfirmed' by other averages, are rarely technically strong, and are virtually always doomed to complete retracement by c-wave. If the analyst can easily say to himself, 'there is something wrong with this market', chances are it's a b-wave."*

It appears a final flush to around 7600 (Bitfinex) is underway which represents a Fibboncci 61.8% retracement from the all-time highs set on 17-DEC-2017.
Currently awaiting Coinbase to join Bitfinex to take out the lows of 02-FEB-2018.
Projecting a bottom using Fibonacci extensions with Elliott Wave relationships (illustration below)...
*Zone 1*
     61.8% of entire market.
     Intermediate-c = Intermediate-a * 1.5
     Intermediate-c = Intermediate-a * 1.618
     Minor-c = Minor-a * 0.5
     Average 
*Zone 2*
     Major-c = Major-a * 0.786
     Intermediate-c = Intermediate-a * 1.786
     Minor-c = Minor-a * 0.618
     Average 
*Average: 7109.9 (Bitfinex)*
Amidst a global stock market flash crash, a spectacular sell-off continues in cryptocurrencies at an acceleration quicker than anticipated!
Rather surprisingly, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the all-time highs, and nearby zones of clustered support levels (derived from wave extension relationships); have all failed to provide any meaningful areas of confluence.
And so therefore, the next natural support zone is at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the all-time highs; i.e. at $4257 (Bitfinex).
In regards to the anatomy of wave formation, a rare Triple Zig-Zag structure may be in progress to conclude the final stages of the first crash wave.
