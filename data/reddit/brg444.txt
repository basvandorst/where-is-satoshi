Bending to irrationality is not an option here. You cannot be accusing people of not considering the desires of others seeing as the "popular" agenda was plastered everywhere by a massive astroturfing campaigns supported by *thought leaders* who I will remind you poisoned the well in the first place. 
I'm not trying to convince anyone of using Bitcoin. I did not arrive at Bitcoin with someone having to convince me. There is enough potential and value in it for an unimaginable amount of persons to trust Bitcoin. 
The more potent capital and wealth circulating in the world's markets will be far more *convinced* by a resolute dedication to long-term sustainability and resilience than short term rewards. This is the essence of gold's longevity. 
Bitcoin isn't an ice cream or steak but a diet that will have an impact on the very foundations of its long-term success. It cannot be jeopardized by fool hardy low time preference fancies. 


It is practically impossible for a system of the scale of Bitcoin to hard fork without disenfranchising legitimate users. The social contract runs far too deep. Coordinating such a complex network can only be enabled by centralizing forces unless a critical security risk presents itself.


This is precisely what the Core project has been doing or at least trying to for the last year. Compromise has been for them to put on the back burner arguably more pressing issues, such as fungibility, to provide their entire focus to demands of certain corporate agendas.
Fortunately they have managed to pull a trick out of their bag with a breakthrough of ingenuity that not only addresses the immediate scaling issues but provides equally beneficial adjustments to other long-term concerns.
The idea that this development should be compromised merely to please the hard forking obsessions of some narrow minds is asinine.


This is an embarrassing ball of fabrications that paints a thorough misunderstanding of the dynamics driving this ecosystem. Control of the code belongs to know one. The code that matters is the one being run by the peer-to-peer infrastructure and its diversity of actors. 
Bitcoin is not a vote nor is it a democracy. Its economy is far too complex and diverse to be weighted by public opinion. I will re-emphasize the notion that the divisiveness and toxicity is a result of certain demagogues using their privileged position to attempt to capture the network using a populist and non-scientific political campaign. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:03:12
This ignores the economic game theory behind LN.
The Bitcoin blockchain acts as a court that assesses claims by different users in case of disagreement on the state of their channel.
If you pretend that every user will act in a perfectly benevolent way than why bother with Bitcoin or LN at all. We can just trust everyone, right? 
Again, you ignore the notion that LN transactions involve different time-preference/security tradeoff and that it is less resilient to adversary dynamics than vanilla Bitcoin transactions.
So to answer you last question: no, there is no considerable scenario under which LN never settles to the blockchain.

Oh sorry. I didn't realise your proposal was this bad :/ 
The number of nodes on the network is largely irrelevant and far too easy to manipulate. It is not an appropriate metric to determine anything, much less a variable that would have so much of an impact on the network as the block size limit. 


The moment is not for compromise. The rational path for scaling is rather clear and evident to anyone scientifically inclined. It is spelled out in Core's roadmap and has received the attention and man hours of countless developers in the last few months. Fighting to refocus the attention to the "block size limit" is a step backward.


"Easy hard forks" are not something that are desirable and would be indicative of too much centralization. It may seems counter-intuitive but divisive agendas and in-fighting is unavoidable in a decentralized system. The notion that we must, at all cost, preserve common interest and a unique vision is misguided. Decentralization comes about with a sufficient mass of **adverse** interests operating under the same rules by way of economic incentives. The more diversity of opinions we can manage to fit under the same roof, the more resilient the network will become to coordination attacks by a majority trying to impose their will.

For those not familiar with the design behind Chaum's ecash here is an approximate description of the "blinded signatures" logic behind it:
While TumbleBit's design is of course quite different it uses similar assumptions but also increments the rigidity of the protocol using provably *fair exchange* so as to make it impossible for the Tumbler to inflate or steal bitcoins from users. 
The construction is also inspired from typical unidirectional payment channels: the Tumbler is never custodian of the bitcoins but only serves as a trustless escrow between payer &amp; payee. Transactions are eventually settled on-chain in the same way the more publicized Lightning network operates. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:52:10
It seems clear to me that was proposing a tradeoff solution for those desperate for scaling YESTERDAY!!

@_date: 2016-08-25 21:25:36
Not quite, the alternative to raising the block size limit to 2MB isn't to try and make even more assumptions about future abilities to support certain loads "dynamically". We humans suck at long term projections. 
The smart thing to do would be to try and look outside the box for scaling vectors which are less likely to result in adverse impact and allow for more substantial improvement: SegWit, Signature aggregation (Schnorr sig), Payment channels, Lightning, etc.

Empirical testing is not very helpful when developed under misguided assumptions. Vitalik has an history of making those..
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:40:06
I think an interesting aspect of the primitive being introduced is its potential ability to plug into LN-type networks and eventually provide liquidity to the Tumbler channels using bi-directional channels. 
From what I can understand, large transactions would require a rather large set/liquidity within an epoch for optimized mixing. 
Seems to me like the interoperability of the protocol being proposed brings us closer to the emergence of viable, high liquidity, "dark pools". The scaling aspect is also interesting. If the incentives to bootstrap support payment channels weren't already clear to some, privacy should hopefully seal the deal.

To reiterate your initial comment: apples to oranges.
In Ethereum, the Ethereum Foundation is a centralized force that exercises rather inordinate influence over forking decisions. 
It doesn't seem fair to me to suggest that ETH holders actually expressed an opinion, most of them just followed their oracles. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:51:48
Some of the largest contributors to SegWit aren't working for Blockstream so it'd be great if you could avoid this disingenuous narrative.
SegWit is nearly ready. Maybe it could've been sooner if Roger or you had contributed? Who knows... I'm gonna have to say I doubt so.
After more than a year of back and forth and doomsday scenario brought forward by Mike &amp; Roger wouldn't you think that the existing status quo means "the community" has decided and trusts the judgment and expertise of the Core project rather than the opinion of a guy who can't manage to create valid transactions and blames it on Bitcoin?
Mike &amp; Roger have made it clear they aren't interested in "working as a team". Did you forget the former rage-quitted? Are you maybe unaware the latter runs a subreddit that is dedicated to attacking the most productive people in this ecosystem while doing their best to try &amp; hold everyone back into their infantile skirmishes? 
I don't expect nothing of Blockstream because they have no control over the fate of Bitcoin, merely inputs. Moreover nobody has yet to make a cogent argument for why blocks being full is an issue, especially given the persistent evidence that a large fraction of the space is still taken up by spam. 
Don't mistake your own little narrative for reality. I understand you have a grudge against Blockstream, or maybe you are paid to shill against them but whichever it is, anyone with a brain in this space realizes we can only be thankful for their contribution and the effort they have put into maintaining and progressing the protocol.
If you want anyone to take you seriously you'll have to come forward with stronger arguments because the type of drivel you are intent on repeating is not so different from the tired propaganda one can expect to find on I'd invite you to share it with them in the future as you will find them to be much more responsive to that type of folklore.

That is just absurd. Running a node is the only way to validate the transactions you are involved in without relying on a third party. It is pretty much essential to using Bitcoin in a trustless and private way. See this post for more details: 
As for your second argument, you are seemingly out of touch with the tragedy of the commons involved with miners setting block size policies. Leaving it up to them would precipitate heavy centralization as larger miners would be incentivized to create bigger blocks and consolidate their operations so as to avoid risk associated with propagation delays. This necessarily exerts pressure on smaller operations who are eventually forced out of business. Moreover, the miners incentives are not aligned with those of peer users and removing the cap would externalize the costs to nodes who are not rewarded for their work. Of course this translates into increasingly heavier burdens for peers and disincentivizes users from participating into the peer-to-peer network.
Finally, LN is anything but a sidechain. You have a LOT of homeworks and research to do if you believe so.

No, that's not how Bitcoin works. It is not a democracy and 51% of the network certainly does not have the legitimacy to enforce a hard fork.

I share your concerns but if we make the assumption that a sidechain has gotten so popular as to attract a significant amount of bitcoins then we could argue that a coordinated attack and subsequent theft of those by miners would imply a significant impact on the trust of Bitcoin users in general. 
This could result in a devaluation of the currency which has clear impacts for the miners. I'm not suggesting this is necessarily an absolute deterrent but still something to consider...

There is more to that but certainly nothing arduous AFAIK.

You've yet to put forward any coherent argument as to how the current limit somehow favors the ability of Chinese to put on hashing power on the network. 
Superior bandwidth is irrelevant to the ability of someone to turn on ASICs so clearly you are talking out of your ass. 
What do you think Western miners are standing on the sidelines refusing to turn on all these datacenters just because of the block limit?
Get a grip, will ya?

So is that cheap labor, electricity, etc. just going to vanish if we lift the 1MB limit? 
Do you propose that Western miners are somehow deterred from growing their installations because of the 1MB cap? We should probably tell BitFury...
The notion that Chinese miners' manufacturing advantages and the growth of their hashing power will somehow weaken under an increased block size is so spurious and disconnected with reality I'm really having a hard time figuring out how you manage to fit these ideas in your head...

Everyone gets to participate equally is not capitalism but socialism :/
We all got to start off with equal opportunity: everyone was free to acquire a sizeable portion of Bitcoin's monetary base since the first genesis block was mined.

Unless you go out of your way to tell each and every merchant that you are actually using Bitcoin with your credit card, they're not aware and most likely couldn't care less.
Moreover if people use the card for purchases "on a daily basis" then by no means are these bitcoins "locked" or reduce the available supply on the market. Quite the opposite, they are being dumped periodically everytime someone makes a purchase. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:13:37
What is this nonsense?
Do you realise that Bitcoin is open source software and so new features can never be forced onto users *by design*?
Are you aware that a group of users are currently running a version of the Bitcoin software that's built out of the 0.5.3 branch and ignores most recent soft forks?
Do you really think they were waiting for your BIP to do that?

AFAIK Coinbase holds a marginal amount of Bitcoin. Moreover they're a cash strapped business burning VC money. They're certainly not wealthy.

@_date: 2015-12-27 00:56:29
I see, so you really have no argument.
Chinese miners will continue to put on hashing power irrespective of what happens with regards to the blocksize.
Your first sentence shows you still are unable to process Taek's argument. As long as Chinese own a superior share of the network the western world is the one that's less well connected. 
The only way for Western miners to compete is simply by turning on more hashing power. The block size is irrelevant to that matter.

There is a major difference in that value derived from NMC merge mining depends on the adoption of one particular use case whereas Rootstock has the capacities to spawn dozen of applications, a whole different ecosystem really. 
Another distinction is that while revenues from NMC MM rely largely on coin subsidy and their market value  (AFAIK), RSK MM is concerned mostly with value and velocity of transactions. 
Of course the whole model stands on the assumption that users, developers and miners will find value in Rootstock but it certainly is more likely compared to the fairly basic/limited functions of NMC.

If by that you mean accidental hard fork then yes sure but we've never had a planned hard fork.
I guess you're right, we just need all the "important actors" to hop on board. So what if less active peers get ripped off of their coins because a couple of corporate shills wanted to rush through a hard fork. That'll surely help Bitcoin gain trust.

Seems evident this proposal is not gonna reach consensus.
It is rather strange to propose a "kick can down the road" yet implement perpetual growth. 
It's also increasingly clear that solutions to most of the current problems ascribed to Bitcoin by naysayers can be implemented as a soft fork. See Pieter Wuille's latest posts on the dev mailing list. The line between hard and soft forks are actually much thinner than what is generally thought. Hard forks should be avoided at all cost as they create a rather bad precedent and require nearly impossible unanimous consensus.

Concentration of Bitcoin nodes in a handful of countries is just asking to centralize Bitcoin. Consider that some people put value into running a full node and having peer status on the network considering it really is the only way to achieve true monetary sovereignty.
What you're suggesting is to leave this privilege to first-world users while the rest, and arguably half of Bitcoin users (China), pick up the scraps. 
China is not just "some country with crappy internet". It's a country responsible for 50% of Bitcoin's infrastructure.

"If you want to create a sidechain and your only realistic consensus option is merged-mining and you don’t want to get robbed, then you need a significant percentage of the bitcoin hashpower to merge-mine your coin."
How is it the only realistic option when you mention a couple of lines below the existence of the federated model where merge-mining is not required.
The more likely scenario is only a few sidechains can harness the necessary MM to utilize this consensus model and others will be using oracles, voting pools, federated servers.

It is indeed the case but the fundamental difference being that they would all agree with the existing consensus rules and not attempt to diverge from it since they'd get forked off.

"Economists err if they believe something is wrong when money is not in constant, active “circulation.” Money is only useful for exchange value, true, but it is not only useful at the actual moment of exchange. This truth has been often overlooked. Money is just as useful when lying “idle” in somebody’s cash balance, even in a miser’s “hoard.” (At what point does a man’s cash balance become a faintly disreputable “hoard,” or the prudent man a miser? It is impossible to fix any definite criterion: generally, the charge of “hoarding” means that A is keeping more cash than B thinks is appropriate for A.) For that money is being held now in wait for possible future exchange—it supplies to its owner, right now, the usefulness of permitting exchanges at any time—present or future—the owner might desire. 
It should be remembered that all gold must be owned by someone, and therefore that all gold must be held in people’s cash balances. If there are 3,000 tons of gold in the society, all 3,000 tons must be owned and held, at any one time, in the cash balances of individual people. The total sum of cash balances is always identical with the total supply of money in the society. Thus, ironically, if it were not for the uncertainty of the real world, there could be no monetary system at all! In a certain world, no one would be willing to hold cash, so the demand for money in society would fall infinitely, prices would skyrocket without end, and any monetary system would break down. Instead of the existence of cash balances being an annoying and troublesome factor, interfering with monetary exchange, it is absolutely necessary to any monetary economy. 
It is misleading, furthermore, to say that money “circulates.” Like all metaphors taken from the physical sciences, it connotes some sort of mechanical process, independent of human will, which moves at a certain speed of flow, or “velocity.” Actually, money does not “circulate”; it is, from time, to time, transferred from one person’s cash balance to another’s. The existence of money, once again, depends upon people’s willingness to hold cash balances."

I would like to know how economic incentives can be enforced if only miners end up being able to validate the chain? 
Economic players in the ecosystem trust the value of their holdings in the fact that the protocol is publically verifiable. The rules that define miners behaviour are defined by the consensus voluntary agreed upon by the economic majority. 


Now, don't get me wrong, I'm convinced that most miners hold an important stake in Bitcoin and are certainly part of this economic majority but they're no less important than exchanges, holders or developers.
Miners control progress of the chain and what transactions make it into blocks but they certainly don't and should not ever have unilateral power over the protocol. 
The system is one that is sound because of the checks and balance that align every users' interest. The miners are not gatekeepers, they merely reflect the will of the economy.

This is a well-travelled fallacy that has no grounding in reality. The fact is that most Bitcoin businesses today rely on specialized API services to do validation for them. While you would think that the incentives would be there for them to provide stronger security guarantees for their users given the potential high volume of transaction they do, it's not happening.
Diversity of validation on the network is a pre-requisite to decentralization. It's not about the number of nodes but the cost of running them. Making them available to only top-tier participants is a recipe for disaster.

Most of the proposed methods to validate the transfer of coins between the chains have not been studied enough and are thought of by some people as being incentives-incompatible.

Paul Sztorc recently [released]( details of a new method which he claims alleviate the previous issues. As far as I understand he is working on his own implementation so it will be interesting to see what comes out of this. 
Progress is on-going on the first implementation of a commercial sidechain, Liquid, which uses a set of federated signers to act as validators for the movement of coins within the sidechain as well as between the main chain and the sidechain. More details can be found [here](

The issue is that BU proponents downplay the security risks of diverging away from the valid chain and actually invite users to do so knowing very well this makes them vulnerable to various scenarios.

This view is not necessarily cynical, it is a basic premise of capitalism that resources inevitably fall into the hands of those that make the most productive use of them.
Bitcoin's value is to provide monetary sovereignty to those who would previously have a hard time attaining it. It isn't going to solve wealth inequality. It was never intended to. Maybe eventually it'll put an end to crony capitalism and surely that would help mitigating the current wealth gap but the 80/20 distribution is likely to remain.
75% of coins are already distributed so even wealthy fiat entities will have a hard time scooping up "the value away from Bitcoin" as you put it. 
It's very likely though that they jump into the pool much earlier than mainstream consumers as they have much more to gain from using Bitcoin than regular joes which hardly any savings to speak of.

They benefit the entities who agree to the new set of rules. Of course, being that they are a commercial product, they are not targetted to every user.
OTOH, they will likely benefit the ecosystem as a whole by moving large transfers of value between commercial entities off the main chain and therefore create more space for the average user. 
Without a "trustless" solution to the cross-chain validation problem there are inevitable tradeoffs that need to be made to allow for a more flexible playground to experiment with. There is no free lunch, unfortunately :)

The ongoing circumstances have provided me with a stronger appreciation for Bitcoin's slow-paced evolution.
While SegWit is, in my opinion, the most pragmatic way for the ecosystem to move forward, the tenets of Bitcoin make it so that any proposition should be challenged by the decentralized forces at play. 
It's easy to get carried away with accusations of all sort when the ecosystem has grown so large that it becomes increasingly difficult to properly assess the perspectives of every actors involved. 
The coordination problem we are observing appears to me to be a reflection of the poor state of communication between the various stakeholders in our ecosystem. We must do a better job of organizing the various interests involved and provide a clearer picture of the impacts of any proposal that come along.
We are still very early in the activation period of SegWit and the apparent indecision of miners and other actors offers us an opportunity to reach out and forge stronger between each other. The adversity we are experiencing is nothing compared to the one awaiting us as Bitcoin continue to grows.
Let's make sure we avoid burning bridges early on by precipitating knee jerk "solutions" to a problem that is not one, yet.

Brian is openly lobbying to rip the network away from its peers and hand it over to the miners on a silver platter only to promote his egoistical corporate interest.
I will say again that promoting hard forks in such a way endangers the value of the funds customers have entrusted to his company.

That's rich coming from the guys championing a hard fork in two months. 
Users individually isn't what gives Bitcoin value, in fact it's a pretty worthless metric. Capital invested defines Bitcoin's worth. This is money, not Facebook. Bitcoin would have no problems accomodating billions more. Capital worldwide is chasing a SOV that can escape regulatory friction. They won't be bothered with transactions fees. They currently have to pay lawyers, bankers &amp; politicians to do their dirty work. Bitcoin is much cheaper.

It would be my impression that most active contributors to the Bitcoin Core project strongly support the course initiated by the other more outspoken ones, otherwise they would stop contributing. 
Currently, only three Core developers are employed full time with Blockstream. One can find at least just as much at Chaincode Labs &amp; MIT DCI.

Bitcoin does precisely what the market wants which is censorship resistance. In that regard no level of transaction fee will be more expensive than traditional lawyer bills, bankers fees and politicians bribes.

"From our perspective the most important and true superhuman power of Bitcoin is decentralizaton and that is it. ACH can and will get faster and cheaper. That advantage over time will get eroded.
Decentralization is truly what seperates Bitcoin from everything else. If you increase the blocksize so much that only miners will lot of resources can mine the Bitcoin network then you start limiting the amount of people who can mine and it becomes more centralized and more like an expensive version of Paypal.
That's really where the tension is: people that wanna do a lot of throughput and TPS, make a better VISA to buy cup of coffees with Bitcoin around the corner, at risk of centralization. Then there is other people saying: "Look: it's ours to screw up, we've gotta be very cautious. We want to increase it but slowly and how to do that ?
We feel decentralization is sacred. We can't screw it up, have to be very cautious. I think we tend to lean more on conservative side."

Bitcoin was never about competition but consensus. Those that promote divisive ideas and persist in moving forward with them in the face of clear, logical opposition are endangering the ecosystem and everyone's holding.  
If you're hell bent on creating competition spin-off your own altcoin. Attempts to hi-jack Bitcoin using the tyranny of the majority is detrimental to everyone and is exactly what Bitcoin intended to disrupt. 
At this point it's clear that some people are entrenched in their opinions and have no interest in considering different positions.

@_date: 2017-03-29 08:41:58
I strongly object to the notion that growing the userbase of non peer users increases the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin. You don't have to look very hard to find many attempts by governments at squashing markets used by millions, if not billions of people. The reason why they are sometimes successful is that these markets operate under a framework of trust and third-party authority. 
Unless we can expand the number of self-validating economic nodes then the censorship resistance will suffer. The block sizes is the biggest impediment to continued growth in that critical user base.

@_date: 2016-01-13 21:34:12
That is simply wrong on so many levels. 
Bitcoin's idea is to replicate gold with immutable properties.
The moment you propose that every single consensus-critical rules within Bitcoin are subject to change according to the whim of the majority then you remove any potential value from it. 
Majority rule is not "agreement of all parties". As Bitcoin continues to grow it will attract significantly more loudmouths who might even suggest one day that the 21 million limit should be removed. Should we bend to their will then? 
Reaching consensus implies that there is no more outstanding and valid opposition to any proposition. Clearly ALL of the hardfork proposals have failed to achieve this. If some industry participants choose to move forward with their pet project in the face of such clear dissent it will come at great cost to everyone involved. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:05:41

Bitcoin needs a hard fork for.... the sake of it?
What plan would you like to see implemented? Clearly there is no agreement or nothing resembling a one-time long term solution so if you are proposing that we "kick the can down the road" what's all the fuss about hard forks being increasingly difficult to execute with time? 
Moreover when do you propose we stop subsidizing transaction to cozy up new users? 
Are you going to be the one telling new adopters later down the road that the situation is no more sustainable and that the promise of perpetually low fees made along the way is no longer true and they'll be the one paying the price?
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:31:58
The block size may increase at one point when due process has been respected and we have made more effective use of the existing space and the extra head room provided by seg witness. 
Following a methodical and reasoned engineering process that aims to mitigate the centralizing pressure brought about by larger blocks is the way it should've been done all along. 
Precipitating the orderely nature of things by manufacturing a crisis, as demonstrated, only risks undermining the trust of the ecosystem participants.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:52:03

Only to a certain extent (no more than 12%). Read more about it [here]( 
Unfortunately the more immediate issue relating to block size have to do with miners propagation. More efficient transport of blocks between regular nodes can reduce bandwidth but is not quite the bottleneck it's made out to be.

No, just no. 
Gavin has been trolling for the better part of the last year and is demagogue-en-chef. The last time he laid out his "technically sound" arguments were last year in support of XT. Most of them were debunked by further testing, more importantly the proposed urgency is now laughable in hindsight. He has no technical arguments, no authority, no legitimacy and certainly no credibility left. 
Remember this is the guy who tried to sell you 20MB XT with Mike Hearn as "Benevolent Dictator". Yes, that's who. 
It is now clear has day he has an irreconcilable difference of opinion with most of the current development community about what Bitcoin is and should be. It seems useless at this point to attempt to build bridges since every attempt made in that regard were shut down largely because of Mike's ego but also because Gavin has enjoyed playing into his collaborators' back misleading the industry about the Core team's intentions.

Technically oriented people with the best grasp of the system dynamics have attempted to counter the multiple forking attempts and misguided populist opinions with sound technical arguments for the better part of the last year.
Rather than listening and considering their opinions, a large swath of users have preferred resorting to character assassination, ad hominems and various under-handed tactics in an attempt to discourage and ostracize these people from the decision process.
Mere support for a proposition does not justify forking Bitcoin, especially when there is considerable opposition to such change by some of the most qualified experts in the field. 
No amount of additional discussion is going to convince anyone since most people in disagreement with the current forking proposals have fundamental difference of opinions. It is a waste of time and certainly not productive to continue to entertain these dangerous, opportunistic, power grabs when clearly they will NEVER reach consensus.

The idea that further incentives are needed to run a full node simply illustrates that there is significant friction in running one otherwise if it would be as easy as running an app everyone would do it.

This strikes me as very backwards thinking. 
The reason Bitcoin is successful and thrives is precisely because despite disagreements and attacks the economic incentives are so that the opportunity cost of diverging from the network effect is simply not worth the risk. 
A hard fork is a failure of the incentives system, plain and simple. It simply is not economically rational for anyone with skin in the game to fracture the network since it necessarily implies splitting the value and trust that has been invested in it.

It doesn't matter what the change is, the danger is that it is allowed to change not because of engineering reality but by political pressure.

Network effect is all that matters. Any potential competitor has to deal with the same challenge that Bitcoin has. 
Most transactions on the network are for hundreds of dollars, low-value transactions will move to alternatives that still operate with bitcoin as a currency. 
The value being invested into Bitcoin right now is there because of the trust people have built around it over time. Years of trust, in crypto we might as well talk about decades. 
For people moving millions of dollars in value there is a world of difference between Bitcoin and any competitor. They won't switch because it doesn't matter what the transaction fee is since that is not the main value proposition of Bitcoin.

Nice story but unfortunately you fell for the red-herring.
This isn't about block size or compromise but about governance and who decides what features get implemented. 
What solution exactly has Gavin come up with other than writing blog posts &amp; lobbying various industry players to support his diverse Bitcoin hijacking attempt? 
I know of only one group who came up with an actual, technically intelligent solution that required outside the box thinking: Bitcoin Core. 
Gavin is not interested in solutions, he's about grabbing power away from Core to hand it over to his corporatist buddies. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:08:12
Your calculations are embarassingly naive. 
A well connected node today serves upwards of 20 TB of data per year to peers, under the existing 1MB limit. 
So yeah, a few server racks, a solution to the quadratic hashing problem of tx validation, a top-tier internet connection and a budget of a couple thousands of dollards per month.
Not a Bitcoin I am interested in. Even under today's requirements only a small percentage of Bitcoin companies run their own nodes so with the resource requirements you highlight above, I am confident that the market will simply turn to specialization where everyone will be happy to trust big corp to validate the chain.
I had a hunch you were one of the gazillion Conformal sockpuppet who was going to bring up the "throw more servers at it" solution. Fortunately, actual engineers found better alternatives and are driving the ecosystem towards these.

The fact is that they cannot stop it from happening, only stall the process. As growing traction of UASF indicates, it is the users of the network, supported by the economic majority that ultimately decides what makes it into the protocol.

Inviting discord from fractious individuals who care about nothing but misrepresenting the other persons arguments and appeals to demagoguery is NOT going to help this situation. 
A lot of people, and numerous developers have decided to leave this sub because of the own censorship pressure and bullying tactics of large blocks advocate. Individuals who were intent on educating people on their position and the logical premises behind them were getting personally attacked with dubious lies and fabrications. A number of persons have found their voice lost in the crowd of noise and under the hammer of downvotes and other vote-brigading by the malcontents. 
Clearly at the present point the opposite side is interested in anything but reconciliation and wishes only to fork the Core developers' opinion out of the debate and undermine their influence, effectively *censoring* their expertise out of the decision process. 
This is painfully obvious in their attempt to subvert the miners' opinion by painting Core in a bad way suggesting they are acting in bad faith. The conversation has drifted completely away from USERS as we are asked to hand over decisional power to miners and play into their hands by stroking their ego. 
They ignore any sensible precaution in that regard, proposing that the fork activates at an underwhelming 75% **miner** majority. Their efforts are now fully concentrated into lobbying for miner support with no consideration for individual node users. 
It is time that the Bitcoin ecosystem takes a stand against these corporations (Bitpay, Coinbase) who pretend to represent the economic majority and are making a concerted effort at fanning the flames of this dispute in a painful demonstration of their lack of leadership.

It might surprise you to learn that this "rule of law" has been rather ineffective in enforcing crackdown of illegal operations in other industries country wide. 
The examples are numerous but the rare earth industry is surely one of the most poignant and also draws parallel with Bitcoin mining operations. As much as half the producers of such minerals operate illegally in China and the party has been rather infamously unsuccessful at eliminating this practice.
It is rather easy to comment on these issues from the outside looking in but accounts of the situation are quite different from the inside.

The issue here is that you are taking the liberty of interpreting what he meant by valid block and suggesting that miners only decide the nature of this validity. 
OTOH, anyone observing the current network topography (rather than bible thumping scriptures of 8 years old document) realize that the validating nodes are the only one enforcing the work of miners. 
Without these checks and balances the term "valid blocks" loses all of its meaning seeing as miners can fit whatever they want in them and pretend it is valid seeing as no one can validate it.

I also am very excited about "trustless" sidechains but I think comment [here]( sums it up in a rational way.
Unfortunately, there is no free lunch and merged-mined (DMMS) sidechains involve security assumptions that a lot of people are not comfortable with. 
Nonetheless, the technology is actively being researched and incremental progress is being made but admittedly I doubt it would pass peer-review for implementation at this point in time.

Even if we are to ignore your uncalled for argument to authority, I guess that's the part where your bible thumping falls apart.
The SPV system that Satoshi had imagined has yet to materialize. The absence of fraud proof make his design insecure in a way that it could not be relied upon the way he described it. 
As far as the "proofs" you present, they seem just about as legit as Gavin proving there was no issue for his Macbook to handle 20MB blocks. These sort of tests basically ignore every adversarial scenario that has ever been researched in Bitcoin. 
The rest of your comments are essentially a bunch of claims that not supported by any evidence.

It is very different from mainchain level security. Unless you have nodes on both side of the chains validating each state then you are essentially trusting miners to do it, kinda like SPV. 
There are various game-theoric challenges with merged-mining that have not been sorted out and while it may be an alternative in the future, I doubt that we will ever be able to claim that it is on par with the security assumptions of the main chain.

The security assumptions of the pseudonymous set of miners in Bitcoin are not the same as the ones involving miners securing the transfer of assets between chains (the peg).
I would love as much as anyone to find a reliable and "trustless" way to enforce this two-way peg but this is still a work in progress and likely requires a soft-fork. Considering the contention in the community today, it remains to be seen whether or not these initiatives can reach consensus.
Meanwhile a federated sidechain remains an opt-in system which enables participants to leverage features that aren't available yet on the mainchain while still having access to a platform that interfaces with the Bitcoin blockchain.

I don't know that that's the right mindset. Others who do not have the strict security requirements that should be expected of financial platforms built to handle real value will most definitely ship before we do. The altcoin space for example is littered with extraordinary features shipped with no concern for reliability or stability. They can afford to be the "first mover" because if it breaks they might turn around and claim it was always meant to be experimental. 
It's important to get this right and that takes time. Inventing something better often means you can't take the same shortcuts that your competitors will. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:42:22
This, to me, seems equivalent to suggesting that for the sake of decentralization we shouldn't have one Bitcoin, maybe many, maybe focus on different alts as well. 
What is so hard to understand about the fact that Bitcoin Core has no leadership and is an open and permissionless platform for Bitcoin development.
The idea that somehow innovation is stifled because there's one reference implementation is asinine. If an idea or contribution can achieve consensus and is sensible then submitting it to Core guarantees that you get the most robust peer-review available in the ecosystem.
There is no monopoly. Given the critical security requirements behind a system like Bitcoin it only makes sense that most users favor the implementation that has the strongest network effect. This is not a monopoly, it is the market's choice.

Of course this is inaccurate. The increase occurs per-tx, not users. Do you send as many transactions as BitGo does?

"Expressing their acceptance of valid blocks"
It's clear you take the liberty of interpreting "valid" as whatever miners mine which is just not how Bitcoin operates today. The process you describe does not describe what constitute a "valid" block. Only that miners work to extend the chain of valid blocks and **enforce** the rules, not **decide** what they are.
As far as how the responsibility of validating nodes works, it's very straightforward: economic actors validate the integrity of the chain and reject blocks that do not conform to the consensus rules agreed upon by the economic majority. It is not a "protest", it simply is the only objective way for individuals on the network to operate.
This idea that non-mining nodes just relay blocks and transactions and are not involved in the consensus is asinine. They are the ones buying the coins from the miners and providing them their value. This market value can only be objectively ascertained by validating the work of miners. Coins can only reach less market value if the users understand that something is wrong and can confirm it. Validating economic transactions using a full node is the only way to do this.

I still don't understand your claims that what you have pointed out are cons of SegWit.
From my perspective they are tradeoffs that are largely favorable to alternatives.

Maybe, if they don't mess up the implementation. For what it's worth, it may be useful to consider the amount of testing that went into the Core SegWit implementation.
* The original version of segregated witness was implemented in April through June 2015 for the Elements Project. It has facilitated every transaction on the Elements-based sidechains since then.
* The new soft fork-variant of segregated witness moved to the multi-user testing stage in December 2015 by activating on the SegNet, a dedicated testnet of which there were 4 iterations.
* A pull-request was submitted in April 2016 to Bitcoin Core for review.
* Since May 2016 segregated witness was enabled on the regular testnet facilitating tests in a mixed environment with non-upgraded wallets.
* At a meeting of twenty Bitcoin Core developers in May 2016 an in-person review of segregated witness’s code and test coverage was performed.
* An updated version building on the current state of Bitcoin Core’s development was provided for final review in June 2016. It was merged on the 24th of that month.

Of course that is not accurate, SegWit has got plenty of support.
Now it terms of scalability solution it is by far the best path forward today. 
Hopefully this platform will help clear up the confusion around SegWit as it is undeniably a great piece of technology that enables a bunch of very cool upgrades to the protocol that will be beneficial for all users and miners alike.

Can you link me where? Or are you referring to Flexible Transactions which is obviously not production ready (may never be) and requires a hard fork.

This is not correct, the signature could be segragated and witness bytes counted without discount toward the total weight which would provide no effective increase on the space available in blocks.

I'm having trouble understanding why you would believe that Blockstream has any sort of control over what goes into Bitcoin considering it employs only a minor fraction of the existing Core project development team.
Furthermore I'm very curious to understand why it is you suggest that any development team would control the Bitcoin protocol that is ran from the computer of thousands of independent users scattered all over the world.
I also wonder how it is you can reconcile the notion of open-source with your claims that "no company should have any say whatsoever"?

I agree, of course. Just pointing out that unsubstantiated claims go both ways :) 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:50:56
Bitcoin’s proof-of-work methodology was designed to process transactions on average only once every ten minutes, with large variance. This results in spontaneous illiquidity for parties using Bitcoin as an intermediary, volatility exposure for those holding bitcoin for any length of time, and obstacles for the use of Bitcoin’s contracting features for fast settlements. 
Today, the solutions, more often than not, require a centralized counterparty, which introduces a third-party risk and undermines the value proposition of certain commercial use cases. 
Exchanges and brokerages still require explicit trust in a third party. Their assets are publicly observable on-chain, creating potentially significant security risks for them and as well as their users. 
Such systems leak their intrinsic insecurity into any solutions built on top of them, creating a “house of cards” arrangement where any instability in the underlying system may result in a collapse of the dependent arrangements.
Liquid provides an alternative. No one is forcing you to use it or trust it. 
The participants voluntarily agree to participate in the federation and will also reap the benefits as well as the potential risks.

I don't think it is because of a few trolls.
As was initially pointed out in the original sidechains paper, there remain non-trivial difficulties in building consensus around the script upgrades required to encode the verification rules for the type of SPV proof expected of DMMS sidechains. 
The ongoing segregated witness soft fork deployment are an example of the coordination challenges inherent to an increasingly decentralized system like Bitcoin. 
I'm curious to see the progress that others have done in this regard but my own feeling is that adding the necessary scripting features is not a priority for the Bitcoin Core project, and probably should not be. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:58:56
Witness scripts are discounted because their cost to the network is less than the rest of the transaction data. Unlike outputs they do not go into the UTXO set, and do not need to be maintained on disk or in RAM for fast processing of future transactions.
To better understand the rationale behind the discount, here is an example:
Consider that you have four unspent outputs in your wallet, two of 0.5 BTC and one of 1 BTC. Someone requests a payment from you for 0.75 BTC. As of today, a typical wallet will attempt to minimize fees and split the 1 BTC output to send 0.75 BTC to your recipient and create a change address. They do so because under the current protocol, it takes more bytes to spend a transaction than to split a transaction and therefore is more expensive. From the perspective of the network though, combining the 0.5 BTC outputs (using two inputs) is preferable because it defrags the UTXO set. 
The discount balances those input consumption bytes and output creation bytes so there is no longer a financial incentive to create dust which is bad for UTXO bloat.
By being able to use the extra space allocated to witness data, segregated witness transactions will also free up space for legacy transactions which non-upgraded users can leverage. 
So, in short, no one is penalized, everyone benefits. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:13:58
I don't disagree with any of this.
On the other hand, the two op codes highlighted above came at a different time and place. I don't think anyone is suggesting that additional scripting capabilities are not desirable but the Core developers have a lot on their plate and in the current context I don't see how the relevant op codes fits with their short term agenda. 
IIRC Paul Sztorc made a couple of pre-emptive attempts at garnering feedback on the developer mailing list and unfortunately it did not generate the attention he was probably expecting. I can't speak to the reasons behind this.

You have been fed pseudo-science and seemingly did not make the cognitive efforts to criticize it. Metcalfe's law, especially as interpreted by the charlatans overs at has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin and in no way shape or form is it a proper proxy to evaluate its growth.


In the case of Bitcoin, which is a financial network of value this notion of disparity in terms of value between nodes is even more true. Wealth, in every systems, is distributed according to Pareto's law. 
Therefore, the value of Bitcoin is more a function of the value trusted to it than a number of users which is not even objectively measureable in a pseudonymous network.

This sounds confused. SegWit transactions being bigger is only a consequence of the backwards compability feature that allows faster transition. [See]( 


As wallets upgrade to the new address format is being introduced and wallet implement it, this "anomaly" will fade away.


This seems to imply that every transactions are p2sh+p2wpkh format. Unlikely. The current mix of transactions on the network does not support this observation.

The proposition that orphans are an effective deterrent to spamming the blockchain is a well-travelled myth that has been refuted times and times again.
With the advent of more efficient technology (compact blocks/Xthin) and the emergence of private and public relay networks, block propagation times have been significantly reduced.
Also, if we are to evaluate this under the eventual fee subsidy revenue model of miners, then this notion of orphans discouraging miners from creating larger blocks, with bigger revenues is even more dubious. Indeed, they have a trivial remedy available to them: concentrate their operation and cooperate so that they act as a single pool, effectively eliminating the potential costs of propagation.
In short, this design would incentivize miners to centralize in order to optimize their profit, a behaviour that has been empirically observed in the past and still exist to a certain extent to this day.

The relay network does not eliminate propagation time though validationless mining whereby [miners connect to each other's stratum forming effectively one pool]( is even more effective and is, hopefully you would agree, a centralizing pressure.
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:46:55
Is it so bad if we never get to increase the blocksize?
Rather, is hard forking the network really worth it or should we take the time to squeeze every bytes of space we can get out of the current consensus.  We've learned that we do indeed have numerous paths that promise more elegant upgrade methods and provide the end user with better-engineered alternatives that do not risk fragmentation of the ecosystem.
Absence of consensus for a hard fork is the natural state of things. The protocol is design to force applications to the extremities to keep the Core intact. Bitcoin needs to remain a "dumb" layer in order to keep its footprint as small as possible. 
The situation 5 years from now is incredibly promising. The block size limit is nothing but a distraction for the vast quality of research and initiatives that are being worked on away from the spotlight.

I see the block size limit as a function of the cost to validate the integrity of the network and, for that reason, I think it absolutely deserves to be considered as an "economic consensus rule". 
I've mentioned this before but all of the economic rules of bitcoin only holds in the context where decentralization is strong, otherwise they are vulnerable to change by political influences.
Keeping the cost of network validation low is essential to preserving decentralization.

It was a priviledge to use Bitcoin in the early days when the resources externalized to those who support the network were minimal. As Bitcoin grows, so does the cost to support the network by  running a full node and it is only normal that resources become increasingly scarce as demand increases so that the network can remain decentralized. There are plenty of solutions in the pipeline that can offer frictionless payments if that is what you are looking for, on-chain transactions are all about censorship resistance and security.

There seems to be a misunderstanding as to the purpose of sidechains. They are not an effective scaling alternative and have never been advertised as such. Their main property is to enable new features that are not possible on-chain. For example, SegWit was first implemented on Elements Alpha. Confidential Transaction is another extension that can be leveraged today only by using sidechains.
As far as influence, well the developers there are indeed influencing the direction of Bitcoin by being some of the [biggest contributors]( to on-chain scaling (libsecp, headers first sync). They have promoted several other scaling approaches (LN, Schnorr Signatures, CT) that would be very beneficial to the network as a whole.
Moreover, there are no reasons to believe that a larger block size would disincentivize use of sidechain extensions or higher-level solutions like Lightning. The fact of the matter is that they address different use cases and do not compete with each other. 
Finally, it begs repeating that Core and Blockstream are only developers and their responsibility is to write software. In both cases, it is up to the market to decide whether or not they wish to adopt this software. Remember this is an open-source, voluntary ecosystem: no one is forcing anything on anyone. I would go as far as saying that even if Core developers would announce a 2MB hard fork tomorrow supported by Blockstream it would NOT get adopted by users. 
Claiming otherwise diminishes and, in a way, disrespects the sovereignty of the participants of the network who, everyday, make decisions out of their own volition according to what they see best. Our ecosystem is composed of independent individuals who can think for themselves, otherwise we'd be doomed.

Bitcoin is already functional. It still operates flawlessly for those use cases which require it. It is the very worse payment system yet remains better than every other alternatives out there in terms of censorship resistance and freedom of participation. 
This, of course, is evidenced by the ever growing volume of demand for peer-to-peer commerce: even in the face of 5-10% premiums (localbitcoin), the demand is stronger than ever.

Apparently you are stuck in the present and fail to imagine the future. It's a process, not a state.


A hypothetical competing system would command the same incremental growth that Bitcoin has experienced. Liquidity doesn't appear out of nowhere, it is enabled by an organic rise in demand for the asset. This "boostrapping" phase only succeed if it manages to incentivize users to hold. Your myopic interpretation of "real world usage" is a typical, flawed, assumption about the role of money. Rothbard has referred to this as the fallacy of circulating money: "money does not “circulate”; it is, from time, to time, transferred from one person’s cash balance to another’s."
The network effect goes beyond transactional exchange. Value operates as a signal for other wealth to attach itself to Bitcoin. It's as simple as that and is not limited to the velocity of the asset (to a certain extent of course).
With that said, I see a bright future for a Bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange but I strongly disagree that it will happen on-chain, at least not with the technology available to us today. For that reason, I am absolutely banking on second level technology to provide the stage for such economic activity. Payment channels are a natural evolution of Bitcoin's scripting capabilities and combined with other techniques enable a plethora of alternative open and permissionless protocol on top of which tomorrow's financial system will be built. The risk is to stall the development of these technology in favor of an inappropriate approach with questionable rewards and considerable risks.


I don't know how you can expect to be taken seriously with claims like this above but I will respond either way. What you call "unproductive hodlers" are in fact savers which are the blood of an economy. Without them there is no investment and production which is how capital emerges. 


By using your node to validate the economic activity you partake in, effectively contributing to verifying the integrity of the system without relying on a TTP.

I'm afraid that's also inaccurate. 
Lightning targets transactions that are not economically viable on-chain. It is not proposed as a replacement for on-chain transactions but an alternative. 
While in the short term there might be a perceived effect on fees as   small/micro-transactions transition to Lightning, I see the future demand for Lightning and on-chain transactions as being completely independent of each other, not a zero-sum game. 
If you think about it, both offer very different services that do not compete with each other. Certain users will value the added security and transaction finality of on-chain transactions and will happily continue to pay fees as they increase. 
Similarly, increased demand for Lightning micro-tx might also increase on-chain fees as channel settlement start occupying more of the space available for on-chain transactions.

They do so either because there are no alternatives for the type of commerce they partake in or because they just want Bitcoin so bad for whatever reason.
In each case, a marginal increase in transaction costs is hardly a deterrent to their activities. In fact, it's possible that even at these costs their gain in terms of security, freedom, and ability to circumvent the regulated system is a net positive. 
Remember that the costs of the transactions are effectively subsidised by the network of peers who incur the costs and more importantly are subject to centralization pressure with regards to the miners that order their transactions.

Resilience is a pre-requisite of the foundational protocol on top of which alternatives can be built. 
If you suggest (as most in your camp seem to do) that plenty of companies, business and what not will readily run server-grade hardware to support the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network then it follows that they will also be able to leverage it to serve LN hubs creating a diverse market of alternatives from which users will be able to choose from. Of course, this ignores the various LN design currently being worked on which do not require hubs to function.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin becomes compromised and concentrated to a small number of interests they are then in a better position to force the direction of the protocol which can have grave consequences given the absence of alternatives.

First, why would them supporting Bitcoin payments necessarily mean their users would adopt it? We have seen big company implement it, it has been ported to iMessage through Circle. It's not clear what effect it has had but suffice to say it is not overwhelming.
Have you considered these companies have not implemented it yet because it simply has not been requested by users to a significant enough extent? 
Then again, the type of scenario you describe is not something that can be solved with a block size increase, unless you propose one so outlandish it would relegate validating nodes to datacenters. 
Better, open-source, technology will soon be made available to satisfy these use cases but, again, we need to be humble about the state of our ecosystem. Whether we like or not Bitcoin is not yet ready for the masses. If you are concerned about the price, in my opinion, you should not be because as we focus on preserving a robust and secure network value will gravitate to it because immutable assets that are uncorrelated to other market instruments eventually find their place in investors' hearts.

What anyone said, Satoshi or not, 5-6-7 years ago is irrelevent if it doesn't mention or take into account the science and knowledge available to us TODAY.
Satoshi imagined a system that still does not exist today. SPV, as he described it, is flawed. OldJeffGarzik, before he went all corporate, fully acknowledged the inevitability of Bitcoin scaling through layered protocols. 
The idea that Bitcoin's infrastructure cannot support all of the world's transactions today or that the promise of cheap, frictionless payment is a bit harder to come to fruition than what was imagined does not mean we cannot get there. The conundrum we are facing today is to properly evaluate what path we will take to get there.
Either we scale intelligently and optimize our use of scarce resources made available by a voluntary network of peers all over the world or we essentially ask them to subsidize our thirst for cheap everything until they can no longer bear the costs of decentralized validation. Once these validation services are delegated to centralized, specialized, large scale industry it's not clear what Bitcoin's value proposition is anymore.

This idea that Bitcoin is a broken marriage in which both sides needs to part way is a very unfortunate perception of the incentive models and network effect that result in the value Bitcoin has today. 
If it was the case that Bitcoin needed to be resilient to ideological fragmentation it would've been dead long ago. Time leads to regrets which leads to grudges and then conflicts. There's not a snowball chance in hell we could have ever expected to all walk hand in hand singing kumbaya into the sunset. 
It is my impression that Satoshi understood this very well which is why he built a system that abstracted ideologies, which cannot be trusted, and replaced them with economic incentives.
From this perspective, the motto "united we stand, divided we fall" could not be more appropriate. While the conflicting political agendas make for a whole lot of noise, it's not clear they are a cause for concern in the long run. Indeed, they should have been expected and as Bitcoin becomes even more valuable these competing interests will only increase in number and influence.
On the other hand, as long as they all remain invested in the existing protocol there is a strong gravitation pull that disincentivize every actors from withdrawing from the ecosystem. This inertia *is* what makes Bitcoin robust. It is the cumulative sum of economic energy that enables the system that we so cherish today. 
For this reason, I strongly disagree with the notion that it's "easy to hardfork". Technically it might be, economically not so. If it were true the Classic, XT or BU folks would have done so a LONG time ago. In reality, they haven't because they, rationally, have an enormous fear of failure, most importantly economic failure. They understand they must do everything in their power to get everyone to jump ship with them or else status quo prevails. 
More importantly, encouraging a contentious hard fork is not productive and honestly irresponsible. Creating this type of precedent where a fraction of the ecosystem is disenfranchised is the very DIVIDE we want to avoid. If we start believing our own bullshit that only we hold the true vision of Bitcoin and others can fuck off to their own chain then we create an environment in which every diverging interest withdraw their economic interest from the whole and what we get are independent shards that are less secure and lack in network effect. 
This political shitshow might slow us down but it will NOT spell the doom of Bitcoin in the long run. In fact, it will effectively validate its value proposition as an asset that is not susceptible to ideological agendas.

Of course I do and the best way to preserve resilience against such control it is to reduce as much as possible the attack surface by avoiding the easy way out of externalizing costs to validating nodes that support the network. See: 


Bitcoin will never, ever, be able to support mainstream consumer demand on-chain. The best we can do is optimize the space we can afford and implement intelligent engineering solutions on superficial layers.


When did the common man ever spearhead a revolution? There is a wealth of demand out there for what Bitcoin offers that does not sit in the hands of the "common man".

Because there was a very high fixed subsidy so that miners didn't have to rely on fees early on.

Mining is only profitable because there is demand for bitcoins. Bitcoin miners' activity were, and still are to this day, subsidized by inflation. Transaction fees as we speak are still a marginal portion of the miners rewards. 


You are not describing something remotely resembling the economic dynamics unfolding today on the network. Bitcoin is a liquid asset that is almost trivially exchanged for other value. 
On the other hand, few bitcoins are exchanged for other assets as is evidenced by the distribution of the UTXO set over time. Hodlers are in fact those sustaining this entire economy. Without their strong hands miners would be mining worthless tokens. 
Bitcoin functions perfectly well as a store of value today. Again, the provably scarce supply is the only thing has got going for it. Holding cash balances is a use. Its predictable supply curve is the strongest fundamental ever boasted by an investable asset. 
You seem to project a lot of your insecurities onto others. Running a node and expressing your sovereign right to participate into the Bitcoin consensus for financial liberty is not rocket science. I refuse to believe for a second that specialization of validation service is "unavoidable". Rather, I see a very bright future of scalable technology that manage to preserve a small footprint in terms of resource requirement. 
What is needed is not to take a reckless decision when the system operates perfectly fine as we speak and with so much technology on the roadmap. 
Miners, as long as they are kept accountable, are stakeholders in this ecosystem and share common interest to improve the value of their investment. 
If Bitcoin isn't working out for you then you may be approaching it in a bad way because today someone will pay $770 to get that bitcoin off your hands.

Let me hear this right, a bunch of commercial interests taking over control of the validation network of Bitcoin is somehow a "superior consensus system"? If that's what you are looking for I hear Ethereum is pretty cheap right now.

A "widespread, pragmatically useful, robust currency" emerges with **time**.
Bitcoin's infrastructure is not ready to support such mainstream consumer demand. You might want to argue that you could work your way around it in the early days but we've become victim of our own success and until we have better tools to support massive payment adoption Bitcoin on-chain transactions simply won't cut it.
We've yet to secure a safe and sound infrastructure that is resistant to political interests. Give it time and don't try putting the cart before the horse.
Improving consumer payments is *not* what gives Bitcoin value and demand for Bitcoin will keep increasing even if marginal use cases are hindered by the costs inherent to a decentralized system.

The number of nodes on the network is hardly indicative of anything, especially when it's pretty much impossible to get a straight picture. Identities are trivially spoofed in a pseudonymous system. 


You seem to have completely missed the point of my post. I describe there plainly how specialization has operated as a centralizing force in the ecosystem so far. 
We have seen nodes drop progressively because of resource constraints yet in parallel we've observed an emergence in standardized APIs that eliminate the incentive for these services to set up their own. 
More importantly, you ignore one of the key insight of the validation process which is that without a diverse set of adverse interests the network is more easily co-opted.

It was pitched, first and foremost, as a _purely peer-to-peer_ version of electronic cash. 
When Satoshi was pressed about the scalability issues by the very frist person replying to his mailing list post the very best he could do is rely on the obsolete Moore law and describe a form of SPV security that does not exist to this day. 
It's very clear to any observer he had not thought this through. On the other hand plenty of pundits, at the time, were very much aware of the shortcomings of a global gossip network from a scaling point-of-view.

A federation is a multi-signature scheme where participants run a parallel block chain (sidechain) in which transaction history is recorded by a fixed set of signers rather than a dynamic one like miners in Bitcoin. 
In the same way, they can agree between themselves to move coins to and from the parent chain. So long as a quorum of participants act honestly, the system continues to work. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:24:34
We agree on the last part, of course the number of nodes or the protocol they choose to run has no incidence in terms of determining what the consensus is. 
Rather, it is economically active entities receiving and transmitting payments from these nodes that make up Bitcoin's peer-to-peer economy and miners would be hard pressed to push them blocks that do not qualify with the protocol rules these nodes have chosen to enforce. 
In that respect, you are right that nodes are but a proxy for the consensus mechanism that is Bitcoin. It is the economic activity enabled and validated through them that settles what Bitcoin is. On the other hand, miners hardly get to decide what rules are enforced or which transactions are to be considered valid by the economic majority. They are financially incentivized to work within the boundaries of the protocol agreed upon by every participants in the ecosystem (of which they are, of course, non-negligible actors).

Until SegWit is activated then you cannot send SegWit transactions on the network. Sidechains, being a more flexible infrastructure, create a testbed to implement and test these features before they make it on-chain.
Same goes for Confidential Transaction which is not possible today on-chain until a soft fork allows it.
It's great that you like Counterparty, sidechains are just an alternative, they are not competing and offer different features and tradeoff. Not sure what point you are trying to make?

Where to start....
It's curious that you did mention the *valid* part yet can't reconcile the importance of node in determining which chain is valid or not. 
If Bitcoin is indeed a system where miners decide what is or isn't Bitcoin then why do we need nodes at all? What is the point of verifying every transactions, of downloading and validating the entire history of the chain? 
Is it possible that miners are in fact just employed &amp; remunerated by the network to order transactions and timestamp them? Could it be that nodes are in fact responsible for validating the state of the chain and making sure that the rules of the protocol processed by the miners adhere to the consensus rules voluntarily agreed upon by the economic majority?
I would hope that is the case seeing as in the absence of such checks and balances then I must say I would rather have elected officials than anonymous miners at the helm of a global currency. 
As for the second part of your comment, I already commented in this thread that [this is not how mining works](

I think the Compuserve analogy indeed fits quite well. You know with that centralized governance and all... 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:36:36


That's a nice analogy but I'm afraid it doesn't quite fit the bill. Mining is a way to solve the distribution and double-spend problem Miners are a service paid for by Bitcoin users to order transactions on the network according to the consensus rules agreed upon by the ecosystem. The value of the underlying asset is a function of the demand for it. This _may_ be correlated to its demand as a medium-of-exchange but is NOT limited to that and can just equally be valued as a store-of-value, which does not require high velocity to function.


I'm sorry but that is very obviously wrong. Half the existing supply barely ever moves, does that mean there is no demand for it? 


"It's not me, Greg or Blockstream that is telling you a certain use case or limitless transactions are undesired, it's the network."


The fundamental feature of Bitcoin is its predictable supply which can only be preserved through sufficient decentralization. If validating nodes lose the ability to verify the integrity of miners lost, then the value of Bitcoin evaporates.

@_date: 2015-08-02 19:43:40
Sorry for bringing myself between you and OP but a couple comments...
First, please consider that OP made no mentions of the block size debate. Clearly he is referring to a bigger picture. There is no failure to explain or demonstrate anything since he has presented no argument other than "please re-consider the importance of decentralization". 
Second, about Metcalfe's law and the value of the network. It seems people are quick to throw together users/nodes as if they were the same. While we are able to measure the actual numbers of nodes in the network, the number of users is a crapshoot at best. The application of Metcalfe's law to Bitcoin, while interesting, is only an assumption and is hardly incontestable. This is another way of saying that the network effect depends on user growth. I would argue that you need to consider that the network effect might in fact depend on capital growth. Remember, Bitcoin is a money protocol, value is added to the network by attracting more capital, not necessarily more users (although obviously the two can be correlated).
Finally, there are a couple of dangerous ideas floating around in your nodes/mining deployment logic. One thing is you do not want mining businesses to have to "move their business to jurisdictions with better connections/speeds" because this can eventually create a geographic point of failure. Then there is the idea that more node is necessarily more decentralized. This is false. I don't care if USA, China, France and Canada decide to boot up a million nodes because they are essentially the same one node.
To conclude, I will outright disagree with your last comment. Bitcoin needs no more use case to grow its price exponentially. Will I welcome more? Sure. But the principal ones exist as it is. Bitcoin will grow by orders of magnitude simply by attracting the ever-growing amount of capital willing to exit regulatory friction, not because of cheap transactions.

Look, the fact of the matter is this leads to centralization as only entities on the leading edge will service the network by reason of them being better connected and having a bigger hash rate.

The banks? Where do I mention "the banks"? Why do you assume only the banks would want to store their capital in Bitcoin? 
You will want to run a node because while you may not use the base layer, the robust decentralization will enable a sound monetary base on top of which many different efficient and trustless payment networks can be built.

The crux of the issue is that these two developers use their authority and through a coordinated PR campaign propose "this is what you need". 
Not one suggests they cannot propose an alt coin and ask if "this is what we want". Hundreds of alt-coin developers do it everyday. The blame is on them using political power to garner the favor of the masses and divide consensus instead of creating a new one, from code that should stand on its own merits. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:03:44


So this essentially means you cannot run a full node on your own. See, this is kind of like Bitcoin, if your node runs "in a data center you don't know the location of" then you don't really own a full node and it does little to help decentralization.

Let us try again: 


Only more independent entities running full nodes can improve decentralization.

@_date: 2015-08-02 16:41:46
This to me is a complete misunderstanding of what Bitcoin actually is : a money protocol. It is not a social network (users), it is a value network (capital). 
A currency needs not to be adopted by a wide amount of users to be valuable. If it can serve a large amount of capital it can very well succeed and flourish.
There is more economic incentive to secure and decentralize a network with 1 M users holding 10T$ worth of wealth than 1 B users under a 100 B$ market cap. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:37:01
I think Adam Back summed up well the alt-coin concern in a recent post on the dev-list:


I'm sorry but the TPS is not in any way constraining adoption at the moment. Only a minimal fraction of Bitcoin is being used as a transactional currency. The network effect of capital shielding their assets from government censorship and inflation is not at all deterred by current TPS "issues". We should focus first on the obvious and most addressable market and not get distracted by more "popular" &amp; "social" use cases.

It does have unique value proposition: more work, more hash-rate, more hoarders, more infrastructure. 
The network effect you are describing is, by all accounts, not happening. People don't use Bitcoin to exchange them for goods and services, they use it to buy/sell USD. Retail transactions represent a fraction of Bitcoin's liquidity. The "transactional" usage of Bitcoin is marginal at best right now. A majority of the coins are sitting on cold storage or moving hands on exchanges and OTC markets.

You need to read my first post again. I agree with most of what you said, I am only stating that it should be no surprise to anyone that the state of Bitcoin commerce is underwhelming. 
Widespread use as a transactional currency will take hold when people are willing to hold Bitcoin as it will have become a great, trusted store of value and eventually a unit-of-account. Until then it will remain a marginal use case. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 02:42:34
The reason Bitcoin is worth anything at all is because people want to hoard it, like precious metals. Moreover, speculation is what provides liquidity, certainly not retail transactions. If we're being honest, Bitcoin has no competitive advantage over its "clones" if we base our evaluation on its qualities as transactional currency (7TPS, 10 min confirmation,etc.)

Greg is actually pretty straight forward and nowhere in his post does he mention mining activity. 
That would be because he is concerned, in that particular situation, with bandwidth consumption for regular node users. 
Of course block propagation, as it relates to miners, comes with latency issues but if someone would be diverting attention here, it would be you, since clearly we're not talking about mining. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:03:19
As explained by in the recent bitcointalk post referenced [here]( it should be noted that any such scheme can at the very most decrease overall bandwidth usage by **12%** assuming the very best efficiency.
Since the 0.12 release node owners concerned with bandwidth consumption have the option to run a blocksonly version which enables up to **88%** reduction.

And I have been talking to companies whose users couldn't care less about fees. See how it goes both ways?
Again, you are referring to UX problems from products and services built on top of Bitcoin. Protocol works as advertised. Consumer expectations are not a way to drive protocol development. Of course everyone wants cheap &amp; fast. No they won't listen to you when you reply that there is security tradeoffs to it, they don't care. Doesn't make the problem vanish away.
Have you been seeing many complaints from DNM users? Has the activity on these websites stopped because of the block size issue? Rather than making knee jerk reactions that have grave long term consequence for the protocol should we not focus on user education and providing them tools to circumvent whatever problem they may encounter?
The fact is that use cases get priced out of the market. Are you still sobbing over the fact that SatoshiDice users can post their bet to the blockchain anymore? Has this stopped Bitcoin from growing? You have said yourself that blocks will always be full so any consumer expecting fast and cheap on-chain transactions will forever be disappointed with the results.
Demand for Bitcoin keeps growing so the market simply disagrees with your position. Users of Bitcoin find it valuable and are buying it at prices higher than ever. Your anecdotal evidence don't bring much to the discussion other than another way to inject politics into a technical debate. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:17:07


That is incorrect. Running a LN node does not automatically imply routing payments and charging for it. Lightning is a neutral protocol. Anyone is free to build products and services on top of it but it is inherently not a commercial venture.

The entities referred to are regular users, their weight depends on their economic activity. They're not asked to start running new clients, only to enforce BIP148.

@_date: 2017-04-25 12:40:02
From a technical perspective, UASF is not a particularly complex solution. It re-uses most of the concepts and code that were applied to BIP 9 but modifies state transitions to remove the possibility for activation to fail. It essentially adds a timeout whereas the activation locks in as it normally would under BIP 9 but after a determined period.
While I certainly share your concern for peer-review and software testing, the latest proposal for a UASF ( shouldn't be expected to require the same amount of testing as SegWit as it is a much simpler proposal and implementation. 
I guess your post refers to the BIP148 which is a particular implementation of a UASF which forces MASF. [More recently]( shaolinfry has started working on BIP 8 linked above which is a more generalized implementation of UASF with longer activation time.

The econ. majority required for UASF to happen implies support from major exchanges and other active market actors in the Bitcoin economy. The method works because the market rejects blocks from non-compliant miners as they now consider them non-valid. Miners who do not want the uncertainty of mining coins on a chain which has no economic support (and therefore value) should, by incentives, support the UASF chain.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system Bruce. Hundreds of thousands of people use it everyday without going through those companies. Moreover, the failure of those to execute on unreasonable promises is only on them as they have built their products and services around the idea they could tinker with the protocol to make up for their lack of ingenuity. They have no leg to stand on. 
Companies are not a proxy for users. Suggesting such a thing is simply another check to your long list of comments belittling users of Bitcoin and their independence. You should have some more respect.

I guess that sums up your position. Anyone who has read the article understands that this is a strawman.
While all of your analysis of Bitcoin's economic incentives are certainly interesting and on the whole correct. It doesn't obviate the fact that PoW rests at the center of this security model. My piece is an attempt to explain Nakamoto's motivations in selecting this particular Byzantine-resilient consensus mechanism. I'm certainly not attempting to downplay the game-theory glue that holds it all together.
Miners are essential to Bitcoin's security but only for a very particular reason: timestamping of transactions. Today we have people electing them to the role of protocol gatekeepers. A role that was never intended for them. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:09:49
This works the other way around: the value of coins mined is upheld by the collective trust of the economic majority. 
Miners will have clear economic incentives to settle quickly on one chain otherwise market confusion will further diminish the value of their coins.

The big deal is not “online payments” but very much “monetary sovereignty”. The blockchain is not an efficient payment mechanism but a robust ledger of ownership settling accounts between network peers, Bitcoin holders.

A BIP is not a software implementation. Most people promoting BIP148 have been cautious about promoting any type of implementation before signed binaries are provided. 
Most of your confusion is around my appreciation of the UASF concept vs. "personally expressed support for BIP148".


The economic majority is not to be seen, it expresses its will through the software it runs and the economic consequences that unfold. 


That would be correct. 


That cost/risk is a burden of the miner who decides to mine it. That risk exists at all time and there are no reasons to believe UASF would exacerbate it because the economic consequences for doing so, in both context, remain the same.


That is inconsequential if it does not have the support from the economic majority. 


I am warming up to it indeed.

Actually this is me suggesting the whole "merchant adoption" thing was a stupid idea to begin with.
You aren't very economically minded are you? Ever heard of Gresham's law? 
It's perfectly rational to expect people to hold onto good money and spend their shitty fiat. That's fine and actually a good thing for the ecosystem.
I'm truly starting to believe there are too many holes in your fundamental assessment of Bitcoin that it makes every idea your derive from it handicapped by this failure to see it for what it is. Money, not a payment system. 
Take a peek into how money evolves. Rome wasn't built in a day, neither was gold and the same will hold true with Bitcoin. It is insanity to propose that Bitcoin is ready for mainstream adoption. Slowly but surely we will get there but first we have to create an infrastructure that is safe, sound and resilient. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:00:00

What I propose is that Bitcoin savings are eventually turned into investements. Inflation more than anything forces you to spend your money hastily. If no one invests in the economy then your bitcoins won't go up in value. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 17:53:01
Actually a cursory look at the distribution of bitcoins and UTXOs demonstrates that the majority of coins are dormant in cold wallets meaning that the "value transfer" or payment network use case as you describe happens to be marginal at this early stage in Bitcoin's life.
Most investors right now are speculating on Bitcoin's value as an hedge/SoV against traditional instrument and have a long term view with regards to the ecosystem. They are in no hurry to spend their coins and for that reason their investment decisions are not at all hampered by Bitcoin's current low capacity throughput. It's about the money, not the payment system. This is in line with historical evolution of monetary goods. First trusted as store of values then circulated into the economy as a medium of exchange once enough people trust them. Don't be putting the cart before the horse and please avoid projecting your insecurity on others.

The whole idea behind retail use of Bitcoin was flawed from the start.

@_date: 2016-09-24 20:52:14
I buy Bitcoin because it enables a sovereign monetary base on top of which accountable financial institutions and trustless payment systems can be built. Something that is not possible with gold.
Moreover it has become pretty much impossible to properly assess the quantity of gold on the market given the central banks' control over it as well as the derivatives paper market. The same, of course, is not true of Bitcoin. Provided maintaining a node remains affordable I can easily verify the state of the blockchain and more importantly do not have to depend on anyone to send or receive payments. 
I mean, you yourself admit that gold payments are trivially censored at scale so how you can possibly reconcile this with a permionless Bitcoin I truly don't know. You seem confused, is it the anger that's getting to your brain? 
I'm glad you've come up with your own little experiments and if they can help contribute to Lightning's progress then I'm sure or would appreciate learning more about this. On the other hand I don't share your pessimism seeing as AFAIK there are plenty of potential solutions and alternatives to routing payments. 
By the way, you really ought to chill bruh. It's okay that you feel all insecure and what not but stop lashing out on everyone and start looking inside for the answers.

I see, so it's really an issue with you recognizing the fundamental value that Bitcoin brings to the table and your fear that somehow an altcoin will steal its shine. I can't say that worries me. People are picking up on alt coins right now as speculative pump and dumps and certainly not because they are unable to transact on the Bitcoin network, that'd just be an outright lie. 
Seriously, the pretense that there is somehow stagnation in the ecosystem when in fact it is growing at an unprecedented pace tells me you are only looking at the scoreboard and not the game. 
2014 called, they want their "merchant adoption" meme back. I mean honestly, do you honestly still believe consumers and merchants give a damn about Bitcoin? Of course they don't and they shouldn't because Bitcoin is for the underserved, for regulatory arbitrage, for commerce that is hampered by arbitrary censorship and regulations. Have a look at localbitcoin's volume will you? The momentum certainly hasn't stopped and in some countries it is stronger than ever. Take a step back and get some perspective, you seem to be stuck in some sort of tunnel vision where the only thing you would see as progress is an increased blocksize or a higher price. Hmmm well actually did you notice we are 100% over what we were a year ago price-wise? 
I advise that you refocus on what makes Bitcoin better and not deceive yourself into thinking that we need to move fast and break things. This isn't how Bitcoin has operated ever. It is an organic system, not some corporate product hyped by marketing budgets that promises the moon to consumers because "they have come to expect".

The deeper message here is that there is value to being selective about investors. 
I personally believe we should focus on individuals who value the benefits of Bitcoin as a sovereign financial system and that involves running a node and not so much marketing Bitcoin as some easy peasy SPV wallet system for consumers. 
Therefore the notion that privacy-centric or resources-constrained individuals who are not interested in advertising their node on the network or relaying everyone's transaction are not contributing to the network is rather counter-productive.
Investors with a lot of money at stake relying on a node to send and receive payments are far more important to the integrity of Bitcoin than casual users who spin up a couple of nodes on a VPN just for the hell of it.

Money does emerge through people assigning value to it but all users or transactions are not created equal. It doesn't help Bitcoin much if a hobo off the street accepts Bitcoin for payments seeing as he as little say... economic energy, to contribute. 
As with any economy, the capital allocation and therefore weight or influence of a person/user is determined by a power law distribution. Therefore, it follows that the goal of trying to expand the userbase to every soul on earth in order to make Bitcoin "valuable" is a considerably misguided venture.
It turns out there is value in being selective. Moreover don't you think it is a bit presumptuous to pretend that EVERYONE desires Bitcoin or that it is truly a better alternative for them? If the value proposition of Bitcoin, as you seem to believe, is "free &amp; instant" transactions then it seems plausible to argue that a considerable amount of consumers have never thought the current system created any issues for them in that regard. Unlike what your favorite Bitcoiner will want you to believe, most individuals are plenty satisfied with their VISA card and Venmo apps. If you look to Asia then you'll realize that the Bitcoin payment network has to compete with the most advanced consumer finance industry in the world with specialization &amp; capacitity that are at a far cry from what Bitcoin can possibly offer at the moment while keeping its unique value proposition.
Speaking of, obviously Bitcoin is really unique in that it also comes with censorship resistance. On the other hand, can we really propose that such a feature is desired by mainstream "users"? I wouldn't bet on it. 
In the end the more important aspect to consider is the monetary one and how the sound money proposition of Bitcoin challenges the status quo. Would you say it's a stretch to propose that a great many individuals profit from this existing status quo? I wouldn't. Personally I believe that given how many individuals profit from the existing welfare state that is enabled by the current fiat paradigm, attempts at mass marketing of Bitcoin are really foolhardy endeavours.
I think it is worth taking a few clues from nature &amp; our own biology in that regard. We should not attempt to force Bitcoin down people's throat. Bitcoin is for Sovereign Individuals. Its organism grows stronger w/ support of kins who value financial sovereignty. This relates to the concept of "inclusive fitness". 
You might be interested to know that this is also a theory that is cherished by one of the greatest financial minds of our times, Warren Buffet. The notion that there is only a certain quantity of "quality investors" on the market and that it is preferable to target them. You might have realized already that this is why he has never had interest in spliting his BRK-A stock. To quote: "The key to a rational stock price is rational shareholders, both current and prospective." Read the rest of his reasoning here:  
So in short: yes I very much disagree with your "Goals" premise. More is not necessarily better.

Of course I never suggested that everyone stops turning on relaying nodes and right now you are fighting a strawman but I guess I'll let that slide.
My point was always that it is a balancing act and that non-forwarding nodes DEFINITELY contribute to the network. Moreover that implies that "more is not better" with regards to node count. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 22:06:49
Yes, that is the most simple definition one could find.
On the other hand, these are complex systems and they come with caveats. 
The sidechain will necessarily have different security assumptions. This implies a different risk model that the market WILL weight in its value assessment. For example the miners could potentially reorganize the transaction intending to return your coins to the mainchain, delay the transfer or worse could conspire to attack a sidechain and steal funds. 
This has nothing to do with transaction fees but the fundamental pegging mechanism that is used to bring coins back and forth. 
It's not impossible that the protocol proposed is safe enough that the price discrepancy is moderate and potentially mitigated through arbitrage but still it isn't as black and white as you seem to be suggesting. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 17:17:51
It isn't a numbers game­. The node count is a red herring. 
What matters is the ability, more precisely the cost, for individuals to independently validate the state of the chain without having to rely on third parties. 
Therefore the cost of the option to validate as well as the growth curve of such cost is what we're interested in.

Well it follows from:


The communication failure is to blame on a particular subset of individuals promoting Bitcoin as something it is not. Your old buddy Gavin was instrumental in fueling that confusion over the years. Hopefully you will learn some lessons from him. That blog post of yours doesn't give me much hope though. 
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:28:45


This couldn't be further from the truth and is totally misguiding. 
It is trivial to spin up countless zombie nodes that could potentially sybil attack SPV wallets. Would you say these are a legitimate part of the network? 


Independent, voluntary validation of your own transactions are very much the point of Bitcoin. The only node that really matters is yours. People shouldn't expect anything but secondary security when leeching off other people's nodes.
It is supposed to be a *purely peer-to-peer* network, after all.  
@_date: 2016-09-26 22:59:25


I think at this point the question is whether or not turing complete smart-contracts are desirable at all 
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:20:48
The point is it's a balancing act. Either way, SPV nodes are very much secondary citizens. People should be encouraged to validate their own transactions. 
The point is that zombie nodes that are not used to receive payments cannot necessarily be relied on securely by SPV nodes. Nodes that deal with payments on a regular basis, whether online and listening or not, are the ones that actually ensure the integrity of the network.

The incentives to use multi-sig are not clear to everyone and moreover multi-sig is not suitable to every use cases anyway.
Lightning can be considerably abstracted through proper wallet UX and there are clear economic incentives to leverage its features. If there is hope that Bitcoin eventually reaches any type of "mass market" then payment channels will be instrumental to it.
The idea that we are in a hurry to scale Bitcoin to mass consumer market TOMORROW is what's "horribly failing to touch reality". Rome wasn't built in a day and Bitcoin will still be there when these users are ready.

I take it you have not read or do not understand the underlying message that was communicated in the text I linked. That's okay. 
I don't consider for a second Bitcoin any less attractive because of the poor security of SPV wallets. I don't expect anyone to hold any significant amount of coins to be deterred by the lack of them either.
To each his own I guess but may I suggest you tone down the Dunning Kruger? If you think you have not a thing to learn from Buffet because of an off hand comment about Bitcoin then you'll miss out on a lot of lessons I'm afraid. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 23:55:51
I don't think you understand the implications of the security mechanisms of sidechains.
You don't pay a larger fee and solve these issues. The idea is that there are risks that are not present with typical onchain transactions. If the sidechain is attacked by miners they could literally steal your coins, something that is not possible with Bitcoin. 
This risk will be reflected in the exchange rate of the sidechain coin. Coins being 1-1 exchangeable are an assumption yet certainly not a given.

Bad money drives out good money. You might choose to get picky on some fancy interpretation but this is what it comes down to: people hoard the good stuff (Bitcoin) and get rid of the bad (fiat).
If you are well-versed in economy than I would suggest applying your knowledge to the case at hand and remove your head from the theoretical clouds.
@_date: 2016-09-03 17:10:45
Coins that you receive should be securely validated by YOUR full node. Not other's.
@_date: 2016-09-25 00:44:39
If the 1:1 peg is only probabilistic (as it is with everything Bitcoin) then by definition the dollar value peg is only as strong as the security assumptions are.
Yes, the risk of miners stealing your coins is absolutely independent of the fees you pay. It has to do with the arrangement of incentives and game-theoric nature of the pegging mechanism. 
To better understand, consider that the sidechain does not provide a subsidy for miners but only transaction fees. For that reason, the assumptions that we typically work under in Bitcoin which suggest a miner will not attack the chain at risk of losing subsidy isn't so clear anymore. 
You may want to look into the SPV Proof mechanism that has been proposed or the Drivechain material from Paul Sztorc. It all comes down to additional complexity that leaves sidechains open to more vulnerabilities than typical mainchain transactions. For that reason, until the market is satisfied with the soundness of this mechanism, it will price-in this risk.
To be clear this doesn't mean I am in anyway against sidechains. I've been a staunch supporter of them ever since Blockstream introduced them but with time I've come to realize there is quite some complexity in their implementation which, I figure, is why they've taken some time to emerge.

Money comes in different forms. Rai Stones were practically useless as a medium of exchange yet served as a store of value and signaling mechanism for entire tribes.
Bitcoin, in a way, is a modern form of such signaling mechanism. Of course your argument is self-defeating given the progress in terms of second layer systems expressly designed to provide high throughput payments. Again, there are no signs that we should hurry to provide half-baked solution to non-problems. 
You people really could use some imagination. Even if Bitcoin was reserved to on-chain payment forever last time I checked low velocity bearer assets such as gold aren't doing too bad.

None of the alternatives you list above are "trustless" either. 
They rely on game theoric assumptions that have not been tested yet in production and have assuredly inherited from the defects of their underlying protocol. 
Federations otoh rely on upon well researched distributed database game theory. 
I will concede that I'm not comfortable with the "backing" term being thrown around either. Nevertheless, the technological development, maturity of the Bitcoin protocol makes for great foundations and Liquid seems to me like a serious commercial blockchain contender in terms of immediate market addressability. 


The set technologies under the Elements sidechain umbrella provide strong privity and verifiability, attributes that are building blocks of future [control protocols]( 
The fact that a thousand idiots are putting together their own consensus protocols nowadays doesn't mean there is no value in distributed systems.
Liquid or Strong Federations might not address the "absolutely" trustless section of the market but they are a decent attempt that does not try to do too much.

Bitcoin can accomodate an unlimited amount of capital as it stands. Its transaction throughput as nothing to do with this as the value will be looking for a safe haven place to park itself, not a convenient transaction platform.

No. Just no. Go read some legitimate monetary history then maybe we can have this discussion.
The common man rarely, if ever, transacted with gold coins. Silver? Maybe. Copper? Sure. Gold? No way in hell, most of them were way too poor for that. Gold was something used mostly by the high society  for large value transactions. 
It is digital gold by way of sharing (and improving on) all of gold's monetary properties. The fact that a majority of people are still ignorant or do not recognize these features has nothing to do with it. 
Bitcoin's competitive advantages comes down to trust and history. Same for gold. Remember that gold is not the only scarce precious metal.

Why are you under the impression that everyone shies away from "prohibitive cost". You make many assumptions that are simply not true. The utility of cryptocurrency is not in its low cost, it is the decentralization which provides it censorship resistance under sound monetary policies.
A large majority of world's wealth could not careless about transactions costs. What they are looking for is a safehaven for their money free of inflation, theft, taxes. The value of a cryptocurrency indeed resides in its userbase but is not correlated to the number of users but amount of money they decide to trust to it. Many people are under the impression that we need to make Bitcoin mainstream for it to succeed. That's absolutely backwards. What we need is to attract as much fiat capital as possible, the hashing power follows the biggest pockets because they can guarantee they will be able to pay for the service provide. 
Alts can very well service the use-cases you are looking for but Bitcoin is simply not designed to compete with other payment systems. It is indeed destined to be a high value, low velocity settlement layer. And that's perfectly fine because we can build all of the utility layers on top of that while keeping the core as trustless as possible.

That's standard procedure anytime he tries to push his "theory" down people's throat. Apparently he does not agree with the obvious tragedy of commons at play wherein the nodes bear the costs of bigger blocks produced by miners. 
He also chooses to ignore the obvious observation given his data that miners are incentivized to collaborate and centralize in order to reduce the orphan costs and increase profitability. (as they have been shown to do in the past)

Satoshi was quick to correct this error of no block size. To be honest I could care less about "the original design" since we now realized it got a couple things wrong. Care to support your "eventually large blocks" statement with sources anyway?

@_date: 2015-09-22 19:57:18


The reason we addressed this issue is that I mentioned their Bitcoin liquidity concern as an answer to your initial comment on their ASIC farm. Now you're trying to spin your way out of this but certainly you won't deny that provided you have the capital it is much cheaper to actually mine these bitcoins than to buy them at market.

It seems to me the more important concern is about them raising the block size. Matt Corallo has explained the potential outcomes of a free floating block size more than once  and I fail to see how these miners votes proposals are any different.
Large miners will trivially add hashing power behind their "vote" and likely precipitate as much as they can the rise of the block size to choke smaller players out of the game. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 21:17:00
I asked you sources for your statement that "large blocks" are an original to the security model of Bitcoin. Please define "large blocks" and do you suggest we were never meant to fill these blocks or might that be what Satoshi meant when he said to "change it when we'll need to".

I see a bunch of VCs who have given little thought or concern for this blocksize debate and have resorted to blindly trusting words from ONE developer about the issue.
I've spoken to a couple of guys from "the industry" at the Scaling Bitcoin conference. Let me tell you they wouldn't think twice about bumping the block size to 1GB tomorrow if it was up to them. They'd be happy to return to their VCs with new numbers about how Bitcoin now scales to X TPS. As for the nodes well they'd tell you they'd gladly run one but are not too concerned if you or me will be able to.
What's myopic is this vision that somehow these companies are all working for the greater good of Bitcoin. They're VC funded companies and they operate under one motto: scale fast or die young. This state of mind is particularly dangerous to Bitcoin. I am reminded of a certain somehow who once expressed the same concerns. 
"No, don't "bring it on".

@_date: 2015-09-20 03:37:20
It's always funny when someone brings this up because of this particular bit of insight I gathered at last week conference from Peter Todd:
Satoshi, in the white paper, mentions that relying on SPV is inherently insecure unless we can provide some type of fraud proofs. It happens that such proofs don't exist today and are particularly difficult to implement. 
There was a whole lot of things Satoshi did not envision and plenty of knowledge we've acquired in the 5 years since his white paper was published. Defecting to authority to make security decisions today is not something I believe he would've thought wise to do and certainly would acknowledge some of the limitations behind his original plan.

Ewww. So from your POV Bitcoin needs to get cozy with the Big Corp and Big Gov to succeed? 
You realize Bitcoin was created to work outside of this framework? That it doesn't have to fit in with the establishment to succeed? I'm not surprised.. you people would do a deal with the devil anytime if he'd promise to realize your dreams of "moon". 
Reality 101: Bitcoin doesn't need "broad mass user adoption" to succeed. Stop trying to sell Bitcoin as a social network. It's not Facebook. It's a money protocol. Its success is not dependent on its number of users but the amount of capital it attracts.
We're trying to build an economy here. Don't be concerned with mainstream adoption. The herd will follow in due time. They might benefit, as we all should, from Bitcoin's value but they're certainly not the ones who will create it.

I will repeat what I said in another post, you are welcome to try and clone 407,718,729 GH/s of hashing power, until then... Similarly you cannot clone Bitcoin's history and the trust it attracted. 
You're not the first to attempt the "gold is different because it can't be cloned" argument. I'm sorry to say but it doesn't hold and shows a clear misunderstanding of how money works. The qualities and properties (scarcity) is important to sort out the good moneys from the bad but over time it is trust that makes its strength. Your proposition might've been valid a year or two after Bitcoin's release. Not anymore.
There are many metals as scarce or even more than gold yet they cannot claim the same trust as gold does. You might say this is because of the 5000 years of history of gold. Well in crypto, Bitcoin's 5 years might as well be 5000 years.

The point is we cannot allow to make it any more difficult than it is now. In fact we should strive to make it easier. A world where commoditized nodes are available to any and all that cares enough and are trivial to run creates much more value for Bitcoin than a miniscule increase in transactions at cost of raising barrier-to-entry for nodes. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:30:39


*rolls eyes*


Bingo! Every chip is an access to their mining pool which allows real microtransactions by aggregating them from their micropayment servers and then settling on blockchain without users/devices paying miners fees.


....why don't you do the same? Why bother mining at all? Of course you know the answer to that! 
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:07:14
One doesn't need to be an expert to understand that rich people (the ones in control of the resources in an economy) are not deterred by transaction fees. 
The transaction activity, while not irrelevant, has a marginal effect on user growth/loss. My market analysis is quite simple: a majority of the coins are sitting in cold storage untouched. No one is bothered by the transactional capacity of Bitcoin since they have no incentive to get rid of their coins. Aside from specific niche use cases fiat is still king of consumption and it should remain so until it loses all of its value, that's Gresham's law in effect.

It is obviously centralized in the way they aggregate the microtransactions but think of them like a Lightning hub. Eventually the transactions are settled on the blockchain.
We're talking micro/nano transactions here. There's no reason why you'd want to leverage the full security/decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain for each and everyone of these. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 04:47:33
It is extremely different and cash is very much still king. I can only vouch for the Philippines but even in the most rural remote area you will find a Smart money "agent" (think M-Pesa). Abra and their investors are seemingly well aware of that reality and targeting precisely these markets:
“Arbor sees huge potential for the Abra business model globally, but especially in China and Southeast Asia, which are traditionally large cash economies but leapfrogging into mobile payments and bypassing traditional banking and card infrastructure at an accelerating rate. Making cash mobile will unlock a lot of opportunities in these markets and across the region.”
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:16:04
Wow you totally missed the mark. Trace was perfectly right about transaction fees. Everything he said was obviously right from a business acumen standpoint. Good customers are paying customers, not ones that wish to drive all of the cost down and not pay due price for the service they use. Cost is obviously not our main concern, censorship-resistance through decentralization is and this has a price. 
The mistake in your logic is assuming that all prospective users are somehow driven away by high transaction fees. That could only be true if cheap transactions were the only value proposition of Bitcoin but it isn't. The majority of capital flowing through worldwide markets are not deterred by transactions fees, they are handicapped by political/legal friction. Bitcoin excels at removing this friction and an enormous amount of investors recognize the value in this. Stop mistaking the common man on the street as the only target market for Bitcoin, this shows a tragic ignorance of the dynamics of an economy. The consumers are not the only players in this game. 


This is where your opinion diverges from his. Bitcoin is absolutely first and foremost about money, monetary freedom to be precise. All the rest is bells and whistles at this point and has never shown to be the driver of Bitcoin economic growth and certainly doesn't project to be in the near future. 
Bitcoin is not a social network, it is a value network. "The big wigs" certainly are more attractive as prospective adopters given the amount of capital that they control. Bitcoin is **not** going to take off because of the mainstream, that is a common myth that needs to disappear. 
If Fidelity Investements' project necessitates a 50mb blocksize are we going to just bend over and sell them Bitcoin's soul because "adoption"?!

There IS payments, I'm not sure why you keep repeating there isn't? 
Anyone has the ability to spend their bitcoins but the service is provided by nodes and miners who have expenses and need to be rewarded consequently. Why does "potential future growth" necessarily translate to payments growth? 
If another crypto can offer the same decentralization that Bitcoin does while improving on the efficiency and capacity of its payment network then by all mean please point me to it. Until then...

It's more complex than that and this proposition, in fact, not true at all. Growing the block size by a considerable amount absolutely redesign the security model and incentives of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 21:24:23
Stop trying to turn Bitcoin into a social network. It's not about how many people adopt it. What we're concerned about is how much capital is trusted into it. 
This capital will come from institutional investors having an increasing interest for Bitcoin as a tradeable asset/commodity. This is where the next wave of adoption will come from. Certainly not from some "mainstream adoption" fantasy. 
Face it, Bitcoin is a poor offering from a consumer POV and will remain so for several years. It's promises as a transactional currency will only realize once a majority of people on earth hold it and its value has somewhat stabilized. We need to get it a couple of orders of magnitude above where it currently stands before that happens and this growth will happen from the pockets of high net worth individuals and funds.  
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:34:31
I don't see how that holds true. The "small blockists" want an intelligent progress on current design. The "large blockists" want to use their dream of mass adoption to support an irresponsible increase that would drive Bitcoin into centralization.

Bitcoin is digital gold. 
When you put this through your head you'll understand why your blabble about "transactional currency" is irrelevant. 
Gold has never gained mainstream adoption, has historically had only marginal transactional use yet it is still sitting pretty today at a couple trillions in market cap with billionaires, investment funds &amp; major financial institutions each sharing their own piece of the pie. 
All you have to do is sit tight and watch Bitcoin replicate and surpass this exact model. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 21:19:11
Your concepts of economics are utterly broken. It seems I can't do anything to change this.
An asset (money) gains acceptance by people investing their capital into it. Bitcoin has grown to this stage by more people trusting it to hold or gain value over time. That is the network effect you should be concerned about. 
High net worth individuals could careless about easy or cheap transactions. They are looking for a refuge for their wealth and will increasingly look toward Bitcoin as a safe haven.

It is likely the idea being conveyed there is one of a bearer instrument   to be used without reliance on a third-party. If his concern was to create an easy-to-use and cheap to transaction system his design was poorly chosen to say the least.

@_date: 2015-09-24 02:43:25
Alright you win, maybe *nothing* was a little strong but look at the post I was replying to : "unlimited block size".

Which amounts to what I call a fraud proof. Look I'm not here to argue semantics but you clearly understand what I mean and should therefore understand the point about the difference between Satoshi's vision of SPV and its current implementation. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:37:38
Satoshi's design mentionned a way to secure SPV users with fraud proofs. Something that doesn't exist today and that we have little idea how to implement. Until then the SPV security tradeoff is considerable.
Even then, there is no reason to pretend Satoshi had it all figured out. A lot of users alerted him of the potential dangers of dependence on SPV very early on. There are many of disagree with the idea that Bitcoin will be maintained in datacenters for obvious reasons.

Do not worry about it this is a scare tactic.
You will be able to exchange your bitcoins through any peer-to-peer exchange/transaction that does not involve a third party.
That's because only third parties maintain "blacklists". there is no such thing in Bitcoin. Again this is another demonstration of the importance of being able to run a full node so as to privately be able to broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network. 
No sane party involved in a transaction will, on his own, consider the provenance of a coin and make a business decision based on whatever contextual history he could pull up. That is complete bollocks.

@_date: 2015-09-04 12:41:58
As someone pointed out just below, mining centralization is inherent to the economies of scale involved. What's important to realize is the block size cap effectively works as a check on those. 
You might argue it hasn't worked so well so far but it is a rather complex problem. It won't stop the economies of scale per say but the effect it has is to level the competition between small &amp; bigger and more importantly better connected miners. An important raise of the cap too quickly might precipitate centralization as it will eventually be in the interests of the larger miners to fill their blocks with more transactions and therefore choke the smaller miners out of the network. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:08:49


That's what you like to imagine but it is not the case. 
Bitcoin's future is clear to anyone with a bit of foresight: a low-velocity high value settlement network. bitcoins will be traded on a plethora of supplemental layers but it will cost you quite a bit to transact on the base layer. It's ok, this shall be an educational exercise for you I guess..!

First off Paypal does not accept Bitcoin.
Second, this might just be a blessing in disguise. It should be clear now that merchant adoption has not been a driver of Bitcoin growth and one could suggest it has impeded it by generating selling pressure as every Bitpay merchants cashes out to fiat. 
Moreover, it is certain, by all accounts, that the retails usage of Bitcoin is marginal at best. It is likely that most companies who have come out to "accept" BTC, especially in 2014, were doing so trying to ride the coattails of Bitcoin's media hype and generate free publicity. 
It might be disappointing to some and certainly is sad for the many employees involved but by no means is this "a big blow" for Bitcoin. Just like in the fiat economy businesses will fail and this should not be an indictment on the currency itself.

The dust is there so that your machine has some satoshis to communicate with other devices using the Bitcoin protocol.
Forget the mining, the chip is also there so that you could eventually sell the idle resources on your computer on a market place and everything will be fully automated.

The Core project publishes code, they have no decisionary power over the software being run by the group of peers that compose the network. Therefore it follows that they certainly cannot "push" anything. Organic adoption of SegWit will happen or not.
This here is the difference between the community of developers working on Bitcoin and outside interests with certain agendas: they make no attempt, whether through propaganda or political outbursts, to incite users to run their software. They certainly can make recommendations, especially as it comes to potential risk that some other advertised implementation carry.

It's it not about generating revenue but allowing devices to speak to themselves using the Bitcoin protocol by enabling them to mine financially negligible amounts of satoshis to lubricate the whole payment flow without anyone having to buy bitcoins for the device.

The "miners" as a collective doesn't exist. Propagation is not a constant and can be infinitely improved. At a certain point groups of large, well-connected miners will be "able to efficiently propagate" very large blocks which can be used to choke out of the network smaller ones.

Cool so merchants running the nodes and users on SPV wallets. No problem here, right? 
This is an obvious non-sequitur. There are no clear incentives for mainstream users to run full nodes and the recent increase in users and decrease in nodes has reliably demonstrated so. 


You and I but not the others. For someone who's all about appealing to the general public that doesn't sound so fair does it? I could equally say if the price skyrockets you and I will be able to pay for more expensive transactions fees. And btw unless you are worried about helping transactions be relayed between nodes, it makes little impact whether you are running **dozen** of nodes: it really all amounts to **one** independent peer in the network. 


Not true. The settlement blockchain will serve a whole ecosystem which will profit any type of users. If they care that the rules of this ecosystem do not become corrupted by malicious actors or regulation it is likely they would be willing to participate in its governance, especially if the requirement to run a full node are kept low enought they can eventually be commoditized and made cheap and trivial to run.

Bitcoin WILL be adopted by billionaires, investment funds and other high net worth individuals willing to escape the increasing capital controls, taxation and inflation. It's simply ignorant to pretend otherwise.

Do you really imagine that rich people care about what the common man can use or not? I don't see them being deterred from using gold because "people" can't use it, same with diamonds or off-shore accounts. 
It's quite naive to put this much importance into this "transactional" network effect. It is by all evidence not the driver of Bitcoin adoption.
Bitcoin's principal value emerges from its potential as a deflationary, censorship-resistant store of wealth. The payment system offered by its blockchain is bells and whistles and obviously cannot compete with other more centralized platforms. No one is investing millions of dollars into Bitcoin because of "cheap and fast transactions".

For those who did not care to read, these lines here explain exactly what is wrong with the rationale of those pushing for this "emergent consensus" scheme. 
As it happens, miners could not care less about the "Acceptance Depth" &amp; "Excessive Block" metric being "signaled" by other non-mining nodes. All they are concerned with is producing blocks that will propagate fast enough to the hashing power in proximity in order to start working on the next block. A miner could therefore introduce sybils himself announcing acceptance of large blocks and produce ever larger blocks on top of which others will be mined as long as he can get a certain % of the mining nodes to accept them as valid. 
The orphaning risks is of course easily mitigated by better connectivity which in effect creates incentives for the miners to centralize. Of course the BU folks know that because this is exactly what pointed out to their Chief-Charlatan Peter R.
In short, what this emergent consensus really means is that a small group of well-connected miners can effectively dictate the size of the blocks on the network and nodes have absolutely no recourse in putting a check on this growth. The author himself suggest that if blocks larger than you can accept get mined on top of then SFYL but you will be left behind until you can get this brand new server rack. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 05:29:04

Miners effectively have no reason to limit their "preference" settings, these are well equipped entities who will have no issues keeping up with even the largest blocks. 
As illustrated in my previous post, it only takes a few miners to be well connected to make it a non-problem from a propagation standpoint and so therefore they have little incentive not to start working on top of the block his friend pushes him. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:28:25

Again, what a shame to have a Bitcoin miner of all people be so narrow minded and unimaginative. 
It's completely irrelevant what the mining ROI are. They've explicitly stated the goal of the device is not the break-even or even return a profit from a pure mining subsidy standpoint. 
You *could* make a similar device yourself but you wouldn't have access to 21inc full software stack, micropayment servers and neither would your little creation offer any interoperability with the thousands, if not millions, of future 21inc. embedded mining products. 
As for the price of the device, this is a dev-kit. It might be a tiny bit overpriced but this is not aimed at the consumer anyway so this is beside the point. 
As for the liquidity, let me insist and specify that they needed **Bitcoin** liquidity, something you cannot acquire by sitting on a bundle of cash (fiat).

Quite a lot of people seem misinformed with the politicial dynamic of Bitcoin: anarchy. For some reason they cannot reason the absence of a governance system and seemingly cannot help but look for a hand to lead them. I think it's worth stressing the point that Core are not these shepherds and are in no position to coordinate a hard fork that is not demanded by a overwhelming consensus from the peer-to-peer network.

There are quite a few faulty assumptions in Narayanan's work if you ask me and while it is interesting to consider various future scenarios.

This is a pilot version for developers and entrepreneurs. Soon enough the chips will be embedded right into your computer.
Using 21inc. mining pool you can now process real micro/nanotransactions without having to pay usual miner fee as they will get aggregated by the pool and included into block. 
This sounds like a service worth paying for. Of course no one would be stupid enough to buy a $400 device expecting mining subsidies to be the revenue model.

No it is not "important to factor this into the discussion".
The paramount concern is security and decentralization. If we cannot retain these then Bitcoin is useless. No amount of block size increase can accomodate all of the "projected demand" so it is irrelevant to factor in this demand.

So you have been here all this time yet the very best you can bring up are previously debunked drivel that are completely unsubstantiated...?
1. Blockstream has no plans to monetize Lightning and it happens to be quite a difficult proposition business wise for anyone who would like to attempt this. Your claim that "they will earn significant money" is not backed by any evidence whatsoever. Moreover Lightning is an open-source projet: more than half a dozen companies are involved and out of the dozen of developers working on LN implementations, Blockstream has two. 
2. They are indeed not an insurmountable problem. Segwit introduces an increase so by all accounts everyone, even Core devs, agree with you there. So far so good. As far as empirical evidence that 8MB would cause significant issues for the network, it exists and is well documented. Nodes voting is not something that is possible under existing assumptions of the Bitcoin protocol (pseudonymous, permionless participation). Miner's interests are not necessarily aligned with other network participants in terms of determining an appropriate block size limit given that the cost of producing them are externalized onto others. 
4. Why are you looking for a leader? Bitcoin is an anarchic system support by voluntary participation, it shouldn't have a leader. 
5. These are actually the least of our worries and quite out of our control. What we should be considering though is making sure the game is as fair as possible.

LN was introduced by Tadje Dryja &amp; Joseph Poon of Lightning Labs. Blockstream currently has two employees working on ONE of several different implementations out there in the wild. 


Which one do you mean? Coinbase (BBVA, NYSE)? Circle (Goldman Sachs)? 


I know some in this ecosystem seemingly have daddy issues and are looking for a leader or guidance but Core devs are in no position to push a HF through and I am quite certain none of them are interested in such a responsability. Bitcoin is a voluntary network and no one holds the power to lead a hard fork that has not emerged from bottom-up, organic demand. Clearly that is not the case: the  agitprop and resulting attempt to create urgency to hard fork is only a result of certain high profile figures manufacturing a certain narrative in order to co-opt Bitcoin development in order to get the peer-to-peer network to subsidize their (poor) business model.
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:23:57

@_date: 2015-09-22 00:15:08
Lots of things wrong here.
Transaction throughput is not the key to success: censorship-resistance through decentralization is. If you want to accomodate any and all transactions maybe you want to check out Ripple.
You are repeating the same old and wrong assumption that Bitcoin users are necessarily interested in transacting with them. Reality has shown this isn't the case. Gresham's law will make sure people continue to save Bitcoin and spend fiat for a long time to come. 
A "settlement layer" will support an enormous ecosystem which everyone will have access to. It will be interesting for them to support this ecosystem by running a node. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 13:48:51
It matters because the "orphan block" deterrent is almost non-existent so yes miners will be able to push through the network blocks that are considerably hard for a certain subset of nodes to download &amp; validate while keeping up with the network. 
The idea of course is not that this happens overnight but is done incrementally in order to driver peers off the network and make it pretty easy for an attacker to capture &amp; control to a certain extent the p2p network.

Except this is not the appropriate narrative because devs do not decide what peers on the network voluntarily choose as software.
Peers, wanting to remain in sync with the consensus, will want to use the same consensus rules as everyone. If Core devs would release a software version without a block size limit it isn't clear that peers who understand the details of the protocol would move forward with this implementation. 
Therefore the idea that the block size limit, as currently **voluntarily** enforced by the consensus of peers on the network is somehow artificially set by top down governance of developers is nothing but propangada used to stir the ire of the masses who don't know better and can't think for themselves.

Not quite. The miners relay blocks to each others using FIBRE &amp; other relay networks that significantly improves their latency vs. non-mining nodes.

There are many reasons why this is not true. The Bitcoin Classic event was a perfect display of that seeing as shitty VPN nodes encumbered network propagation, performance and were a huge drain on resources of regular users. 
If you are considering running a *relaying* node, please do it properly.
Of course, it is just as much important if not more to run your own node to receive/send payments in which case, depending on your economic activity, the effect on the network is arguably more valuable.

Actually it was nixed by their own misrepresentation of what support for Classic implied. It followed a long tradition of deception on the part of Mike/Gavin so necessarily once miners realized what was up support was pulled real quick, even before the HK "agreement".

The tone aims to ridicule the concern trolling that Jeff has been indulging himself into for the past year. 
If he had genuine concerns he would have expressed them in the correct context, to the right people in appropriate time. 
Unfortunately he backed himself into a corner through various disingenuous armchair critiques postulated on social medias and conferences where no actual engineers or project contributors participate so that no appropriate response to balance out his obviously biased opinion could be produced. 
More importantly, his arguments are based in some weird "Block space economics" concept that makes various liberal assumptions which are easily disputed.

Absolutely not. I know you all like to pretend like it isn't a thing but, as Adam keeps repeating ad-nauseam, Lightning (an open-source protocol) will provide for an elegant and natural write-cache extension to Bitcoin. 
There are currently no alternatives to fully validating the keys in your wallet other than by running a full node. SPV, failing to include fraud proofs (which Satoshi alluded to), does not come close.
On the other hand, we will have an ever growing list of alternatives with which to transact your bitcoins. Lightning will offer a variety of implementations and arrangement that will put to shame any of the "transactional" needs you so stubbornly want to bloat Bitcoin with. 
"Transactions portals" won't be "gatekeepers" they will be **open-source code**. It is more likely that Lightning will be the run away winner seeing at its flexibility can be put to so many uses especially through sidechains. 
Soon enough if we let some people work we'll have onion routed private transactions which would be a formidable boon for Bitcoin's privacy. 
There was never any debate as to where Bitcoin's power resides but in its network of **purely peer-to-peer** nodes. Seeing as Satoshi had originally failed to account for the separation of mining and transaction validating duty, nodes enforcing the Nakamoto consensus are our most precious resource as individuals. 
The problem is privileged "developed world" ignorants are so expectingly egoist they think this little corner of the internet called the reddit and bitcointalk community is representative of Bitcoin's actual user (read: full nodes).

The reasonable thing would be to keep Bitcoin's blockchain footprint as small as possible so that it resilient in the case of attacks on the internet grid which could restrain access to the gigabyte connections people nowadays take for granted.
The sane approach would be to keep Bitcoin as a high value, low velocity settlement layer and build the necessary stuff for handling global transactional capacity on top using superficial layers.

It certainly helps relay transactions and help other full nodes catch-up. If we were limited to only mining full node the network's decentralization would certainly suffer given the current state of the mining network.


That might be the case but that network is not Bitcoin. It may have been what Satoshi had in mind but it didn't quite turn out that way.

Collapse? No. Does it defeats the goals of monetary sovereignty behind Bitcoin? Yes.
Remember that Bitcoin is first and foremost a **purely peer-to-peer** form of electronic cash. There is an assumption here that it should be within reasonable limits for someone to participate as a peer in the network without having to dish out hundreds of thousands of dollars in server farms. 
If you do not have the option to validate your own transactions than you necessarily have to trust someone to do so. SPV might be a reasonable trade-off in certain cases but we cannot afford to leave peer privileges only to the future bankers of the world. The only way for individuals to hold them accountable is to have the option to independently assess that everyone is playing within the rules of the game. 
Sure that does not necessarily mean the blocks have to remain at 1MB forever but the danger here is entering a slippery slope which at one point could lead to a capture of the network governance.

The market is composed mostly of Bitcoin investors. They are the one who ultimately decides on the value of the network is. 
If you agree to that then you should understand that the individuals who make the majority of "the investors" group could not care less about an marginal increase in fees by the simple fact that they are largely "Bitcoin rich". 
This very clear fact also suggest that they do not particularly care whether adoption by those who cannot afford larger fees is hindered.
As such you may need to revise your expectations of what "the investors" pain points are and if really they consider that blocks filling up undermines Bitcoin's "optimal value".

We're pretty confident that 2MB shouldn't exacerbate the problem of centralization too much but 8MB? I'm curious to hear what analysis you have done that would demonstrate an 800% increase in global resource usage won't have any impact? 


Under what premise do you argue that demand for censorship-resistant, globally redundant block space secured by exahashes of hashing power is tied to technological improvements.

@_date: 2015-09-07 00:16:38
Hehhhh is this not very naive? You are basically inviting any transactions on the network as long as they can pay for themselves? 
How does that address what, in my opinion, is the true tragedy of the commons at play here: the miners' own interests externalize an important cost to the nodes of the network which remain unpaid for. That's all good and well if your plan is for the miners to run the nodes but I don't see how this align everyone's incentives which should be the point of this exercise no? 
I'm not even convinced this actually deters centralization much as the  very act of centralizing is the obvious way for miners to mitigate the "increased costs" of filling up blocks.

Seeing as you so liberally stick wrong intentions to Blockstream's work without so much as an hint of benefit of the doubt I hope you don't mind others do the same with yours.


Is that why you wanted to scale Bitcoin beyond its means with respect to decentralization before it was ready? I'm sure you are aware of the numbers you are speaking of when referring to dropping inter-bank transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain. What size of blocks would've been required? I'm guessing at least.....32mb. 


So in R3CV's case it's perfectly OK for its clients to adapt "the block chain algorithm" but somehow it's against Bitcoin's interest when Blockstream does the same in partnership with its own clients?
What difference is there between a custom blockchain and Liquid? 
AFAIK the "Bitcoin system" can not move around bitcoins in a private &amp; instant way which is what Bitcoin exchanges have signed up for. Is that not also the nature of private blockchains? To pick up the slack where Bitcoin is "crippled"? (Please spare us these backhanded critiques)
So now I'm pondering, seeing as by all evidence Blockstream operates under the same model as R3CV does while using different technology (and currency), if your grudge is not as much against Bitcoin as is it against Blockstream.
It would make sense that your **employer** would consider Blockstream as competition seeing as they could *and likely will* reinvent pretty much all of today's financial system but with **Bitcoin** as its foundation in an **open source and collaborative way**.

There are other type of centralization other than hashing power centralization.
The well known SPV mining incident is one example of that. No one has control or governance over the miners' decisions to implement such scheme and as shown previously it has proven to be dangerous for the network. 
I'm not sure I understand your second comment. In a scenario where the blocksize is unbounded nodes don't get to decide whether or not they can propagate, validate and download the blocks. If miners pump 1GB block then either they handle the load or lose track of the chain and get forked off the network.

On the opposite, I do expect that pools who comply with any thing so much resembling blacklisting will be left for dead. 
3) Obviously you're just pulling things out of your ass at this point. A majority of miners enforcing centralized transaction censorship would lead to the death of Bitcoin and their business. Fortunately I expect most of them to understand that and never comply with such a stupid idea.

Bitcoin is about monetary sovereignty and this is only achievable by running a full node therefore we should strive to make this option available to as many people as possible.
I want Bitcoin to be resilient and the government and corporate incumbents' control over the internet grid is the biggest danger that Bitcoin will face in the future. China should be a stark reminder not to take current internet access for granted. The best way to mitigate this risk is to allow for Bitcoin to remain a low-latency, small footprint network.

Did you happen to come across Patrick Strateman's presentation suggesting that if we follow you down BIP101's path it wouldn't be long before it becomes quite a task to actually set up a new node from scratch?


8 GB blocks to a minimum of 2 peers every 10 minutes. So at least 2TB of upload everyday. Consider me skeptical. 
Moreover this doesn't address the resiliency issue and does not prepare Bitcoin for adversarial environments where the pie-in-the-sky technological progress you so readily assume are not made available to everyone. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:24:43


Or they could be incentivized to centralize and increase coordination to easily mitigate the propagation issues. This is especially concerning with Chinese miners. 
The more obvious reason as to why the block size limit cannot be unbounded is that most of the cost of creating larger blocks are externalized to non-mining full nodes who are not subsidized for their work. 
Basically it is a tragedy of the commons where full nodes are left vulnerable to the miners' decisions. This has the danger of centralizing governance of the Bitcoin network into a handful of datacenters who'll be left as the only entities able to handle the load.

@_date: 2015-11-07 04:25:09


And you are wrong. In fact, one user's access to a full node is central to the trust-free security of Bitcoin. I'm unsure exactly how you arrive to this conclusion seeing as how you spell the facts out quite clearly:


As such, running a full node really is the sole way to use Bitcoin in a "trust-free" manner. 
Full nodes indeed don't enforce the rules, they dictate them. Bitcoin's **purely peer-to-peer** network of nodes are responsible for the governance of the network. Dishonest nodes are on the whole harmless as long as a large enough network of fully independant entities have access to participation of the consensus process and will relay transactions according to the laid out "rules". 


I'm really having a hard time figuring out how this even computes...
Bitcoin without SPV wallets is mostly just non-mining full nodes. Unless you propose that Bitcoin without SPV wallets is just miners trading coins between themselves.

(B): I've previously debunked this idea of yours. The market reaction to Satoshi moving the coins is completely irrelevant of what coins are moved. If a wallet created in 2014 could somehow be tied to Satoshi's identity and he would proceed to move them the impact would be the same.

Miners cannot decide since they don't bear the full costs of the creation of these blocks. 
Under an unbounded block size they will attempt to maximize the amount of tx they can fit into a block with no regards for the load being shouldered by the nodes. Miners' incentives are simply not aligned with other non-mining full nodes.
If you want an answer to how small that is, I've argued it should be small enough to make it possible to run a full node over TOR or the likes.

Bitcoin.org is an independently run website, I'm not sure where the claim that "the majority of bitcoin's open source contributors gather around" it holds.
Bitcoincore.org was created specifically to avoid this confusion.
You are free to keep the paragraph as it is but I'm not sure it helps your proposal. I personally fail understand the narrative that implementations have to "compete" with Bitcoin Core or how the network effect around it "discourages independent competition". 
"Disruptive innovation" is available at the click of the "fork" button. If Bitcoin Core's code was so "bad" you would believe the market would have accounted for it. If an alternative implementation or idea was so valuable it would succeed on its own merits. 
There's an underlying "blame game" in this section that is really puzzling to me.

How many times does it need to be repeated? How long will you continue to ignore the security and decentralization tradeoff?
Adam &amp; Blockstream's interests are not in subsidizing off-chain solutions but maintaining the very fragile decentralization properties that make Bitcoin what it is. To quote:


You were at Scaling Bitcoin, I'm sure you were sitting with all of us during Ittay Eyal's presentation of the existing impacts of larger blocks on the network.

Oh please, are you actually arguing nodes are not switching to XT because they're hesitant? That is absolutely delusional. 
The fraction of the community you speak of has made their intentions known. Considering the apparently very small influence it has on nodes it is safe to say their "strength in numbers" might not be what it's all cracked up to be. 
Additionally, a plethora of Bitcoin users already run different implementations. The obvious difference is that these all implement the same consensus code whereas XT attempts to diverge from existing consensus. It is time your group stops fooling itself into thinking you haven't had your chance. You did, and your fork was rejected almost unanimously. 
Now, Bitcoin XT is free to exists as a different implementation of the existing consensus code but given the lack of peer review and absence of ecosystem support it is not a very appealing option for the market of nodes. I guess this is the tradeoff of dealing with a sociopath lead dictator.

The competitive advantage Bitcoin has over others is not in the realm of fast and instant payment but censorship resistance, security &amp; liquidity. In that regard no alternatives come close.
As long as the lion share of value is being transacted on Bitcoin, say 80/20 power law distribution, then Bitcoin has no legitimate threat. It is the case today and I don't expect this to change in the future.
The transactional throughput is a growing pain but one that will be resolved in due time yet it does not present a life or death situation for Bitcoin.

Sure you can have a tweak waiting in the wings but the danger in that scenario is you open the chain to all sorts of attacks given it's low hash rate. 
IMO such an eventuality would be the near-death for Bitcoin as most of the trust would be lost. Should we prepare for it? I guess so but I can't conceive how it ends in anything else but tears and cries.

I think a very important distinction is that this "collective decision" is  not forced on anyone. 
Setting of the min relay fee remains a voluntary decision on the part of the node owner. 
The decision process seems rather simple: given the resources constraints subject to an unbounded mempool configuration here are the recommended settings.

If miners start censoring transactions then it's a totally different ball game. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:48:56
Uneconomical for the network of nodes which is generally limited in resources. 
Relaying transactions represents a cost for every peer in the network. Some might be able to bear more load than others and that is why the minrelay parameter remains voluntary and can be changed at the discretion of the node owner. 
The "default" behavior is nothing more than a recommendation and every peer is best advised to calibrate this setting according to their best judgment.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:06:46
There are no miners to speak of unless there are users. The incentives of the system make it so that miners will prefer the option will least opportunity cost which is the one supported by the economic majority.
If they disagree then they are free to avoid mining SegWit transactions and carry on with their business. It will be economically self defeating for them to intentionally create a fork with high probability of being reorganized or orphaned by network consensus.

BIP109 was not discriminated against but ultimately rejected by a consensus of Bitcoin developers as an half-assed solution that implied considerable risk versus the rewards it offered. 
The same is true of BIP100, in fact it's universally agreed that this was one of the worst proposal out there and was abandoned by its creator in due time.
Do you have a link to where Xtreme Thinblocks was submitted to Bitcoin Core repo? Or maybe evidence that it was rejected because of the relay network and not because better alternatives were in the work that came with significant efficiency and privacy gains? 
You can find more about the history of thin blocks proposal here:  
All in all, as is expected from typical trolls, most of your critiques are unsubstantiated and display an evident lack of understanding wrt to the dynamics and history of Bitcoin protocol development.

That is not true. A single committer could not obstruct the implementation of a patch in the face of overwhelming support from the rest unless they have absolutely valid reasons to do so. Provided that they have then it is more likely they can convince other committers with their arguments.
So far we have had, I believe, no controversial changes in which the economic majority was rejected by the decision of a single developer. 
Please spare me the revisionist history that somehow XT is just "waiting in the wings" until somehow Bitcoin users realize the error of their ways. Your groups pathological attempt to mischaracterize market support for your position is aberrant. You realize that some do not hold the opinion that full blocks are a problem. That, objectively, it may be desirable that they fill up so as to properly repel spam.  
If, as you say, things get down to the wire, then one should understand this means consensus has changed and favors a move. You propose that rather then Core simply going along with this change in consensus, the economic majority should switch to a different implementations with "some unkowns, controversy" &amp; a comparatively very limited peer-review process.

The mischaracterization is clearly spelled out in the original comment. 
Peter R knows damn well the bottleneck is not non-mining nodes block propagation and the associated bandwidth but latency between mining nodes.
As usual he obscures this fact through carefully crafted demagogy that diverts the attention away from actual problems and the work being done by Core developers to solve them.
Peter R is effectively repackaging years old technology, sprinkling some efficiencies on top of it and suggesting this "innovation" is ill-intentionally discarded by Core developers. 
This is nothing but another strike in his longstanding trackrecord of deceit and manipulation. An outstanding character really!

Bitcoin as a platform already exist. It is peer-to-peer money. 
The wise thing to do once you have realized this, at such an early stage in the game, is to hoard it for its speculative value as a non-correlated asset. The reason this is important is that the more people we have doing just that: buying and holding, the bigger the monetary base will be and if really there's is a platform to be built it is this one. 
All of the "apps" you speak of have so far proven of little interest for the market. I don't care how many users they are telling VCs they have "signed up" and their "projected growth", it simply hasn't reflected in the price of Bitcoin to this day. Yes you need to build the bridges but you also need to give the people a reason to come. Fortunately Satoshi had thought of that and somewhat engineered Bitcoin to appeal to the **greed** of people. 
There is no way around it. That is the only way mainstream is buying in else they are way too comfy in their fiat dreams.

There is no centralization of development, only a centralized repository for Bitcoin's consensus code.

@_date: 2015-11-12 16:56:52
That's a rather curious stance re: economic engineering.
Bitcoin is an experience in economic engineering. 
The 21M cap is economic engineering, so is the block interval time. In general it is far from true that everything Bitcoin is left to the free-market. 
The "cost of producing and transmitting blocks" is inevitably heading toward near-zero by use of legitimate coding gains (IBLT) but more importantly can be considerably mitigated by miners' coordination (centralization). 


Again, do you not consider the 21,000,000 limit a "key variable"?
@_date: 2015-10-22 21:43:04


Agreed. Yours is even worse though.
While it may be difficult to use the internet without going through an ISP, Bitcoin allows transactions without using intermediary. 
What do you make of services like Localbitcoins? As Bitcoin adoption continues to proliferate increasingly more exchange and sale of bitcoins will be done peer-to-peer. In fact one could argue a majority of bitcoin sale today is already done that way. 
I personally suspect Satoshi did not chose not to bake true anonymity, he simply may have not thought it possible at the time.

I don't buy it. These coins will be seen "inferior" by whom? Only the ones enforcing these blacklists who are all third-parties by definition. Proper peer-to-peer usage is not affected. 
What I propose at the end of my comment is that it is inevitable that the black market/informal economy will largely surpass the "legal" market at which points coins that have been tied in one way or another to "illicit" activities will vastly outnumber "clean" coins. Consequently any entity which insist on refusing "tainted" coins will  slowly but surely ostracize itself from the economy hence my argument that this practice is not economically sustainable. 
A brief analysis of existing black market economy tells you this is not a problem. Users of DNM for example knowingly handle their transactions with "tainted" coins yet no one values them less than current market price. 
For example, if what you describe was true, a 275$ item on the DNM would currently sell for 1.2 or 1.5 BTC which is not the case.

Moreover, the entities that will make Bitcoin "mainstream" are not shopping at Coinbase &amp; Circle.

Scientifically that is referred to as "peer-review". Fundamentally there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, in fact it should be considered desirable. Referring to it as "biased" stems from your own bias toward a competing implementation. If what you propose had been historically true and an actual problem then this growth would not have happened: 
You keep working from the premises that core developers have arbitrary control over what goes into Bitcoin because of their "veto" yet you show no facts to support this stance.
The selection bias you speak of comes down to user preference. Development skills are a scarce resource and it happens that Core has attracted an important majority of it. Considering the consensus critical behaviour of the system it is reasonable that peers would adopt the most peer-reviewed and historically reliable implementation.

Investors care very much about the prospect of a digital store of value. 
If you are too blind to see the appeal of this then there is little I can do to help you but stop confusing your characterization of who you believe Bitcoin investors to be and who they actually are. 
The biggest Bitcoin holders (who you will not find on Reddit) are likely solely invested for the prospect of a digital, censorship-resistant gold-like asset. The payment system and surrounding technology is bells and whistles. Sure it creates value but nothing like the ability to store wealth in an asset outside the hands of state institutions. 
Everything else you've just said is just a bunch of numbers pulled out of your ass. The Bitcoin-wiki was written by Mike Hearn whose plan was to centralize Bitcoin from the beginning.

Simple, the rewards to attack are much less than the risks.
"Lets imagine I receive $1M on a Bitcoin address and wait 1 week for it to be buried under a 1-week worth amount of work. What we need is to make redoing this work cost more than $1M. The amount of work done in one week should really cost more than $1M. In other words, for a blockchain to be actually secure, there must be a huge gap in cost between that blockchain and the next best competitor."

And keep their users fund vulnerable to a single point of failure. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:27:47
Maybe I need to be more specific here: I firmly believe that Bitcoin will forever remain a low-latency payment network. In fact I believe we should intentionally work to preserve this **feature**. That is because lower latency also translates to lower latency. Bitcoin's footprint need to remain small and operate over low frequency networks so it remains **resilient** to attacks on internet infrastructures. 
The reason this is important, I feel, is the liberty to run a full node and participate on the network in a **purely peer-to-peer** way is the most fundamental right a bona fide Bitcoin user should have. 
That is to say: the importance of validating your own transactions and checking your balance by yourself supersedes the need for high transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Those actions are the very definition of monetary sovereignty. 
So you will understand that I would much rather we scale the Bitcoin ecosystem and turn it into the financial system of tomorrow! Like the internet let us sow the stack of infrastructure that will reap us a free market of competing open source layers that will differentiate in trust reputation, privacy, price and efficiency. 
I can confidently says this does not suggest, for one instant, that we "shift control over to centralized companies". In the light of recent developments as well as the apparition and progress done on projects like LN &amp; Voting pools it appears downright wrong to pretend such dichotomy. 
So yes, it is very much and either/or and I pick the resiliency over the efficiency.

It's also painful to observe seemingly intelligent people such as you recognize the difference in views but yet seemingly unable to reconcile it with the current absence of actual cash use of Bitcoin. Obviously that is normal and one should not have to bother stating why it is so. A currency will only be built and gain mass acceptance from something that is trusted to hold value. 
To pretend that Bitcoin is anything like cash in its current format is dishonest to say the least. 
Understand that before "cash" there is peer-to-peer and if we fall for this mass adoption propaganda it will turn out then that only an infinitely small percentage of the population will actually have the ability to become a peer in the Bitcoin network.

I'm not Adam but this is my own take... 
1. It is unlikely that regulators of theses exchanges would be willing to have Bitcoin users participate as equal peer in this system. Moreover, I don't see why you would be interested in relying on a private network of exchanges to settle your own peer-to-peer transactions. 
2. There is no mining hence I doubt there are transaction fees. 
3. Because Liquid involves an order of magnitude, and some, more trust. 
4. See 
5. Sidechains Elements allows any users to spin their own sidechain and issue assets. I do believe these functions are not limited to Liquid but seemingly derived from the general work done with Elements (Confidential transactions, Assets issuance, etc.)

"First of all", you don't "implement" fungibility as it already is inherent to the system. You seriously need to go back and read up on what fungibility is. Every unit in Bitcoin (satoshis) are perfectly indistinguishable &amp; can be substituted for one another. That is what fungibility is. 
What you want is privacy. I agree with you and I recognize the privacy issue but don't conflate it with fungibility. 
As for DNMs, surely you're not suggesting that everyone there uses freshly mined coins. In any case you seemingly don't understand the point. The moment coins are involved in a DNM transaction they are to be considered "tainted" by your standards, no matter their history. Therefore, from your perspective, they should command a discount/premium which they don't. 50 years from now it is more likely that every single output out there will have crossed paths with "tainted" coins which again supports my previous point: it is not economically sustainable. 
About the black market: don't mistake my characterization of it as only DNMs &amp; such. The informal market is any economy in the world that does not answer to traditional fiat regulations.

You sound insecure
@_date: 2015-10-23 01:13:16
So you're essentially suggesting states would control every single miners? If so then Bitcoin has more problems than fungibility.

Again, things "getting dicey" necessarily involves a change in consensus from every participants which would indicate to core developers that a change might be required.
Your proposition that XT (or other implementations for that matter) is the sole alternative for an economic majority to move forward with bigger blocks is false and frankly disingenuous.

Bitcoin consensus rules are not to be decided by whatever miners vote for and it's asisine to propose that every proposal out there should be up for vote. 
Moreover you seem to be confusing deployment of soft forks and hard fork proposals that require network wide approval before activation. 
Their activation was not implemented in Core because they were technically sub-par "solutions", simple as that. 
How is Greg's response to an announcement evidence of the Bitcoin Core project rejecting a "Patch submitted with fully working code". It's convenient for you to evade my request by pulling the "censorship" card but I will ask again: where is the full spec or patch you refer to? 
How has Greg ever rejected the idea of thin blocks when he himself included it in his scaling roadmap? Did you ever stop and think maybe, just maybe, schemes like Xtreme Thin Blocks had already been considered and whatever improvements the BU team made on it did not compare well to current alternatives?

This x1000. Bitcoin is not a social network. Its value does not increase with the amount of users but the amount of value that is trusted to it.
In that regard it is useful to remember the distribution of wealth worldwide and consider the value that can be gained by attracting only a small fraction of the world's potential "users".

Peter, I'm sure by now you are aware of the controversy and disputes over the claims of your paper. It'd be wise not to constantly put it out there as some sort of irrefutable analysis. 


That isn't what you propose which is that miners consider costs of producing their blocks and act accordingly presuming they do so in a rational manner. This seems to me like the equivalent of top-down planning but replacing governance through code run by the network peers by the miners' decisions. 


I sure hope these people don't do you the courtesy of paying for your trip to the next conference seeing as you cannot help yourself but slander their name in public forums. You have no shame Peter, truly.

@_date: 2015-10-05 01:20:44


Sorry but that's all kinds of wrong and works against how Bitcoin operates. Only if the economic majority desires larger blocks can Core be put into this position. Until then, a minority of defectors aspiring to more influence then they really have will not move the needle in the balance of power. That is because these will soon realize that working against consensus for a prolonged period of time is not productive to their financial holdings. 
Consequently what happens is precisely what is unfolding before your very eyes. This loud minority produced their own fork using their implementation but failed spectacularly to gather sufficient support from the actual relevant actors: peers (full nodes), investors and to a lesser extent miners.

That's a common misconception. Bitcoin transactions, as it stands, are highly subsidized to the tune of 25BTC per blocks.

Bitcoin development is open and transparent, pull history are publicly available and so are mailing list &amp; irc channels history. If the way "Core is run" was problematic then certainly not each and every contributor would sweep things under the rug and move away. By now we should expect to have had *numerous* reports of uncooperative comportment coming from *multiple* persons. 
While you are not the sole person to have put forward such concerns the evidence are scarce to support it. 
Therefore anything else that starts from this premises are very hard to argue convincingly. You last paragraph shows a great contradiction from your previous post. If the opportunity is now present why is the XT implementation still showing an absolute lack of momentum? 
There has been an explosion of Bitcoin devs, facts show they have found it convenient and productive to attach their effort to the best supported and most peer-reviewed implementation. 
The proposition that we will encounter increasing debate about the consensus rules is not sensible as it suggests we would want to consistently tinker with protocol's behaviour. I don't think this is desirable.

Blockstream is not a central authority, I believe they are more or less technical advisors. The chain is ran and maintained by every exchanges running their own node. 
They can control who can use the system because of technical oversight of the project but ultimately it is the participants (the exchanges) who decide who can be part or not of their little circle.
As for transactions, Liquid implements Confidential Transactions so that every participant has no information at all about the details of a specific transaction.

I'm not saying Circle &amp; Coinbase will not have a userbase but those that do use them should understand the risk that come with reliance on an intermediary which goes against the ethos of Bitcoin.
In general I expect the mainstream to remain within walled gardens as they are introduced to Bitcoin and therefore it's likely they won't encounter any fungibility problems as they will not be moving their Bitcoin around to "illicit" places.

Yes! Let's just reinvent what Bitcoin was all about and see if it sticks. 
Hard forks are a centralizing mechanism that disenfrenchise adversary interests rather than encourage them to cooperate through proper incentives.
If you want an example of what "social consensus" looks like look no further than Ethereum. They've decided they will fork adverse interests using a majority largely determined through authority. The result? ETH (the forked chain) is now considerably more centralized than it was before. 
If we are to suppose that any faction that disagree or has different opinion about the road ahead should fork to their own chain then the inevitable result is a multitude of less secure chains with smaller network effects. In short, every one loses because of selfish interests and the inability to look further than their own little world.

I'm confident the barriers you refer to have little incident over the motivation of users. 
To be clear, the reason most people could care less about Bitcoin is that they are perfectly fine with fiat and see no problems with it. They are generally served well by their credit cards and would be hard pressed to change their existing habits.

1. It isn't entirely up to the retailers but also their users. I do believe you will eventually see such a scheme set up by the likes of Bitpay or what not. Most (if not all) of the technology used by Liquid is open-source.

Antonopoulos is out of mind suggesting the current hashing power of the network is enough to secure a $1T Bitcoin market cap
@_date: 2016-05-30 20:53:25


It is the reality as evidenced by the empirical data provided in the link above 


That is irrelevant. In fact, it happens that most miners clamoring vigorously for largest blocks have an incentive to do so because of their particular location (China). 
From their standpoint the additional latency that comes from larger block is mitigated by the concentration of hashing power into their geographic region and their SPV mining behaviour. 
What this means is larger blocks would exacerbate western miners orphans and improve chinese miners bottom line. 
As for the "purported rationale", it is trivial to find various statements from Core devs supporting this notion, starting with Patrick presentation above.
Peter R insults his own person every time he comes forward with yet another intentionally obtuse and disingenuous mischaracterization of technical facts he is very much aware of.

The most likely explanation is that they failed to raise a new round in the valley because of their poor financial situation and abysmal performance vs. competitors.
In order to save face and avoid the embarassement of a down round at lesser valuation they went shopping their stuff abroad so that they can close a smaller investment to stay afloat and call it "strategic" because of the foreign nature of the investor.

A bunch of people running exchanges have previously attempted to push through a contentious hard fork proposal. They failed because there was no user demand for it. 
UASF is a grassroots proposal. Attempt to co-opt the method to push through unilateral changes will inevitably fail.

We certainly are all very excited about seeing SegWit activated on Bitcoin since anything that benefits Bitcoin is ultimately positive for us as a company but the reason our founders came up with sidechains were precisely to avoid being restricted by Bitcoin's strong consensus requirements.

Sure, because the returns to compulsion by violence and extraction of wealth do not make up for the inefficiencies of such a large organization. 
The thesis of the book is rather sound: sovereign individuals with newfound wealth from compounded savings protected in crypto assets will challenge the monopolies of nation-states in the market of protection and will bring about new sovereign organizations that will not be defined by nationality and other imaginary/arbitrary conceptions. 
States are not going anywhere but the nationally organized one promises to fracture into a market of communities less subject to over-arching centralized governance which was made possible through the military superiority of nation-states.

A hard fork is inherently centralizing and inevitably disenfranchise a select group of users. In Ethereum's case the moral hazard on display by the main promoters of the fork is an unquestionable flaw in what you trolls refer to as the "governance" process.

Again, more claims with no evidence.
Indeed it isn't so much an extraordinary claim as it is a stupid one. If you ever wondered what Bitcoin is used for I suggest looking at this website  People are hoarding them. Pretty safe to say these aren't Billy the gay escort's addresses. 
On its face, the claim that half of the daily mining supply is "consumed" by DNM's because you've managed to infer some transaction volume from their activity is another misguided guess. It ignores the very obvious notion that those might just be the same lot of coins circulating in this particular niche of the economy.
I understand that the idea that people are actually saving or investing their money into Bitcoin as an hedge works against your Keynesian mindset but that is really what empirical evidence support. 
By the way, your shit stinks as well Chris so stop acting like a know-it-all patronizing douche. How about you practice what you preach and use some humility.

A more relevant one would be average USD value transacted over a day which shows actual transactional traction and not just speculation. Unfortunately you'll be hard pressed to find this kind of data for any coins other than BTC.


It's hard because most of those shitcoins don't even bother offering tx/day statistics.
Do you seriously belive that any significant amount of people use NEM, ETC, DASH, Stratis, Golem &amp; all these other shitcoins with hundreds of millions of dollars market cap to transfer any value on a large scale?

Is there an urgency to accomodate more than 2-2.2MB on-chain at the moment?
I don't believe so. While we've had some hurdles caused by deficient wallet software the network hasn't exactly died under the pressure of the existing 1MB limit. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:57:08


The best chain is the one where the most value can reside even in the presence of adversarial conditions &amp; a diversity of users. A blockchain that only includes people who trust themselves to have the same motivations is rather useless and easily subject to social manipulation given the lack of user diversity, see Ethereum.

The idea that Bitcoin's network effect is dependent on transaction capacity is wholly uninformed and plain wrong on just about every level. 
When you consider that most owners of Bitcoin barely use it to transact it is quite curious why people are bent on trying to create this illusion that Bitcoin needs more capacity for it to grow. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:22:29
The market is already choosing the block size.
Bitcoin is a voluntary system where all participants must be in consensus and therefore cannot be in disagreement about the rules that uphold the system. The rules are not forced on anyone and they're only as effective as the economy that chooses to enforce them. 
The only way for actors who disagree with current status quo to change these rules is to voluntarily exit and hope that the opportunity cost of others staying on the original state incentivizes them to move over to their chain if it proves to have more value.

It's not. It's an evaluation of global demand for transactions and a determination of the resources required to accomodate this demand on chain.

An investment vehicle, speculative or not, is utility. Speculation is how a new form of money emerges, by people entrusting their capital to it in expectation of greater returns down the road or fear that other assets they own will be devaluated. I'm guessing you don't believe in a store of value right? 
You have yet to show any data, certainly none that supports your claim. On the other hand I can clearly point to hundreds of addresses holding thousands of coins that have barely moved for years yet clearly as it conflicts with your belief you will make sure to conveniently ignore these facts.

It's an engineering reality that the network cannot scale to global transaction demand without requiring resources that make it prohibitive for anyone but large data centers to validate the integrity of the chain. 
If we acknowledge this then it only makes sense that we use our engineering knowledge to build solutions that make more efficient use of the space available. 
If we could scale trivially on-chain then no one would be arguing against block size increases so the notion that people are trying to illegitimately incentivize second-layer solutions does not hold its ground.

I strongly object to the assumption that it is true of Bitcoin which is a pseudonymous network where identities and userbase is not measurable.

@_date: 2017-06-03 12:40:19


Often repeated lie that is completely beside the point.
The shift has to occur on a per-transaction basis, giving the ability for only a few entity responsible for a majority of the network's transaction to quickly increase the capacity of the network on a voluntary basis, with significant economic incentives to do so.

How is utility defined though?

or is the appropriate measure a function of the *value* for which it facilitates exchange?
