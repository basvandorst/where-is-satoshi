Dude... you don't need to have someone buy cryptocurrency for you, you can do it yourself. Merrill Lynch invests in stocks for their customers which have regulations. Bitcoin doesn't and would cause problems for ML.

I'm confused, someone please correct me. I heard that the last bitcoin will likely be discovered in the year 2140, which means there will be no more rewards for miners. The miners are what I understand as the process of verification for transactions. If there are no incentives for miners to be on network then how will we ensure verification of our payments?

can't you just make up some "cost" for the mining of that coin to the point where you pay nothing for capital gains? how would they know how much it cost you?
