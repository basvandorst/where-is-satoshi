A new house a car is a liability, not an equity, if you borrowed money to aquire them, you cannot have ROI soon enough. Investment, is only when a physical thing you bought, a service, or an idea you developed is returning you possitive cash flow, when its without a debt, or without maintenance expenses out of your own pocket.

If you really want it, you 'll figure it out, find the exchanges or leverage trading platform and make it happen. You 'll be 18 by then, that's a KYC requirement If you wanna have an account.

I like price analysts!! 
Specially when there is a lack of understanding on a technological innovation. Why don't you assume that the price would be 50$, if the blockchain era is here to stay, a more stable universal token could be used instead of btc, so the market cap would be trillions but the price of today's known tokens just a few millions.

I know that, and my question is, why did you make the assumption that btc would have a 4 digit price. It could be 2 digits, and another more stable token with an algorithm dedicated for fast transactions could take its place.

They do not deduct the amount you are margin trading, they lowering your limit, there is a Fee: 0.01% btc or 0.02 alts per 4 hours plus 0.01 or 0.02 on the open position on the amount you are borrowing. You get margin called, when you are low at near 80% minus fees of your initial amount, not the position, 1000$-20% when the market goes against your position. You can add to your position or close all positions. If you are manually closing your position you've to use some leverage, lower or the same, when you close it or get liquefied, they will deduct the borrowed amount plus fees. Search kraken page there is fees list, on the pairs they support. Place the fee on your base currency.

Aren't we treat it as an investment too? even if we don't short it with leverage right now, it would be a profitable way to trade. I saw eth coming all the way down from 850 to 450, I had my limit order placed at 500$ at least 2 weeks ago.

Apple has a product and a long term portfolio, its ios, it's a closed source system and that's why they can maintain the prices at this level.
