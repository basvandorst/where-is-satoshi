I'm guessing 3QkwXdF7Yv9QTuoPifbTsnEyYuhZ8A7iEo wouldn't be segwit then.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:45:01
Requirements are just to store btc in the "non-segwit" wallet. I have no idea what multisig is either.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:24:27
Created it after 3.0.0. So that means all addresses are probably segwit enabled?

I'm looking at the electrum send section now and it costs me $9 to send $10 (at the lowest amount on the slider), what the fuck lol.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:07:24
If it's not getting sent, what are my options? Am I able to cancel/retract the transfer and re-transfer it with a higher fee so that it'll go through?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:08:08
That's fucking bullshit.... 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:34:11
When transferring funds from old address to new address, how big is the fee associated with it?
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:33:22
Using new software? Or using the newest update of electrum 3.0.5?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:54:14
I did a low fee for my first transaction of 0.001btc and it went through so i thought it was ok to send a low fee, what fee should i have sent?

Thats one expensive pair of dentures
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:04:04
It's already been a few hours, transactions really take this long? I mean, I've never tried to send tx's from electrum before, but when I purchase and send btc from exchange to exchange they only usually take around an hour to 1.5 hours.

So I'm trying to send 0.001btc and the lowest possible fee on the slider says 0.00057624 (replacable, whatever that is) and output is showing me 407 bytes. I am unsure what to make of this, i'm a beginner.

My wallet was created on a version that was before 3.0.5 that was encrypted with a password. Then I later upgraded to 3.0.5 and what I understood from him is that wallets created before 3.0.5 was not secure. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:04:39
Would that affect the amount of time it takes to send through?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:59:37
So when you update the electrum version to the latest you have to create a new wallet address as well? Because I only updated to the recent version but kept my old address from pre-3.0.5.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:09:00
So multisig is supported by things like the upcoming bitcoin private fork (which only requires a non-segwit wallet.)?

Yeah but even the lowest fee i can send is $100 worth of BTC according to the wallet. That's insane, is that the case also when moving btc from exchange to exchange? Because it costed me NOTHING to transfer my btc from my exchange where i bought it from, to my electrum wallet.

A number tied to an account under your name in exchange for either tangible cash through a medium of exchange like a bank, or numbers from your online bank account in exchange for numbers on your bitcoin wallet.

Being a newcomer with a few hundred dollars in BTC, i'm waiting for bitcoin to drop to where it was a week-ish ago when it was still 8-9k.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:45:16
Would it tell you approximately how long the transaction gets confirmed after setting your fee manually, or is it just a waiting game?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:57:30
Accept part of the payment in btc no matter how small. It could end up being worth a lot more than it was worth and you'd still have the security of having a majority chunk of the payment in cold hard cash.

@_date: 2017-12-27 06:11:12
Few questions out of curiosity if you don't mind, approximately how many bitcoins did you have exactly, and how did the fire start?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:57:10
2 questions, if it expires does it mean the transaction has to go through, or does it just become invalid and the transaction value go right back into your wallet balance?
Also, does the amount of btc you choose to set as a fee determine how quickly/long you have to wait, or can a transaction theoretically go through quicker than someone else's transaction even though they opted to pay a slightly higher fee?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:47

Look at the rich list and see how much of BTC is accounted for in what % of wallets. Even with individuals that have their amassed stack distributed in hundreds of wallets.


what security?
@_date: 2018-10-13 22:47:36
You basically just defined decentralization and its properties. Even your point about killing the whales and big miners  = bitcoin still "lives on." There are many PoW coins that this can be applied to. ETH (PoW), XMR, DGB, RVNB, VTC, etc. The sentiment here is that if you eliminate big miners and whales, and the coin still continues to operate = decentralization? 
As for security, it's awful vague to define the entire concept of security as just how much it costs to execute a 51% attack. BTC has more nodes naturally because it's been around the longest, sure.  But don't you think there are more properties to security than just altering the chain? What about vulnerabilities and flaws?
And off-topic about those other 2 factors, what about scalability? While I respect Ln and what they are doing, it's still not as efficient and cheap to do so, assuming Ln is actually deployed, as say something like nano, or [insert instant/free tx coin here].
This isn't me attacking btc, as I recognize btc as the original grandfather of all cryptocurrency.

It may be privacy, but you can also classify it as security. They are both tied together. If someone can identify your transactions and link it to you, you're less secure than you were before the fact. What if in some hypothetical situation they can piece together where you live in real life, and do you or your intellectual property harm?

Have you ever thought those people invested in alts is just in them to gain more bitcoin? That's how it is with me. My entire portfolio is majority alts with probably 10% or less in BTC. my objective is mainly to dump the alts at a higher price if possible and just acquire more btc.

@_date: 2018-10-05 05:09:39
Import &gt; new/restore wallet &gt; paste private key
If balance shows 0, then the corresponding address to that private key is not the address you sent your funds to. 
Once you import your private key, go to the list of receiving addresses. Compare that address to the address in the blockchain explorer that holds your funds. If they don't match up, then you have the wrong private key.
@_date: 2018-10-14 05:26:43
Bitcoin as a technology? Probably not. Not unless majority of the network's nodes turn rogue. Bitcoin as a market? Possible, but not likely. If an entity or organization has enough capital with the intention of harming the bitcoin market then they could just buy up the supply, or start dumping and shorting it and repeat the process until they have acquired majority of the btc for sale on the market. (of course you can't do anything about stored/parked/lost btc) but essentially they'd have control of the entire market.

I've never actually had anyone verify this, it's always been my theory, but I always thought that **ALL** bitcoin addresses already exist in the blockchain, along with their corresponding private keys, so long as it adheres to the address formatting, they're all just waiting for someone to generate the corresponding private key and public key pair for them, but the probability of generating a specific pair is next to impossible, is that basically the essence of it?

You can definitely swing trade though. Usually when we hit the weekly or daily bottom, there tends to be a big swing upwards (maybe just a few %) that you can play if you are good enough at timing.
I personally wouldn't, but the alts I hold, I monitor their charts. Particularly OST, I see it all the time doing a random 20% candle and if i catch it fast enough (usually half of it would've already sold off immediately in the next candle), then I would short-sell it and then try to play the swing when it goes back down again.

Signed up with email. So this is a 1-person operation by you? I thought this was manufactured by a store or a 3rd party seller. If so, that's quite impressive.
Any ETA on availability, or the arrival of a store-website where we can browse and get more details?
