Finally, I am going to apologize for jumping the gun a bit, and s/he was not openly asking for bcash donations he was only suggesting that everyone else donate their bcash which is fine honestly it is all going for a good cause.


Finally, it is too bad s/he didn't throw anything towards LN. 
ninja edit: here is the line




Alas, frankly, the cynic in me questions why someone with 5000 BTC to distribute, take some small pauses, not know where to distribute it and then post a thing about fees when it really seems like s/he made a mistake. Yes people are nice and I am really excited these organizations are getting funded but I always want to know ***why***. I think it is human nature to want to understand motive. 
Anyway, I am not trying to get the person to stop but I don't think throwing out all skepticism is healthy either. my 4 cents

wow this looks amazing

this was posted in r/btc a few hours ago making fun of bitcoin network
Now it is "posted" here with misleading title.
Andreas was right "drama..."

I think its unfair to say everyone has a phone, and who knows what happens in the future... Now it might end up where the world has some super sat based internet like Musk is planning but in the alternative would be nice to imagine transacting bitcoins with only one shared internet connection. 


Seems amazing, I wonder how this can be expanded

But in the scenario, you only have access to paper wallet - not a smartphone or really any computer.
you have to use a "bank" computer to even do your transfers between wallets.
Maybe I am misunderstanding

3rd, also a few days ago he posted how he hated the BTC fees and overpaid by some orders of a thousand bucks
edit: oh and he asked to buy or donate BCH or something along those lines

Yes but that would take way too long, imagine being in a supermarket and each customer has to take over the register. It may also require you to plug in your seed or USB. Which is similar to entering your priv key into their "POS system."
I guess the idea would be that your paper wallet somehow has some way to create send notes with ease... I think in the future of all Crytpo this would be an amazing feature..
