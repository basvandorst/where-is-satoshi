They said "for full confirmation and irreversibility."
With PayPal, buyers can file a dispute within 90 days of the purchase. Meaning, yes, the seller gets the money right away, but it can be taken back by a dispute.

I didn't calculate the mean because it would be thrown off by the wildly high/low guesses.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:41:03
That's not what I was saying at all, I was noting that the median guess is basically equal to the current price, meaning on average people don't expect the price to change at all.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:18:40
My Guess: $234.77
    Current Price: $231.10    
    Median Value of all guesses so far: $231.22    
    Guesses: 355    
    Unique Guesses: 318    
    Number of duplicate guesses: 37

In my opinion, if it has everything you own, you shouldn't keep in in an online wallet. However, what you use is up to you, and you may have your reasons. 
What I do is use Armory for everything, keep a paper backup, and type in my (very secure) password using the on screen keyboard. This foils keyloggers, and if my computer bursts into flames, I always have the paper backup.
It's much **more secure** (on screen keyboard, backups), **less convenient** (no mobile app, only available on the one computer), and **more complicated** (have to sync blockchain, and enter password for every transaction). But I think the pros outweigh the cons.
Like I said though, it's up to you!

I'm not talking about Gox, and the exchange I am talking about is fairly low volume, which I think makes it safer to try this, since there is less movement. I think I'm going to try it with $50 and only use the profits (or loss) from that, and not risk any more than $50.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:19:00
But is it profitable gambling?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:14:33
I think (but am not sure) that the tip bot doesn't process the "฿" symbol. But I'm not sure.

I love your donation counter on the right, it convinced me to upgrade your pay grade to Cuban minimum wage!

That's true. They've had high spreads before.

it's true that it is unclear.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:15:03
Yup, me too. There's lots of people watching the price hike.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:44:27
this is getting a little crazy isn't it? I bought $250 just a few days ago at $35, and am shocked to see it raise this quickly. I guess it's never too late to buy!
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:20:41
Umm, Bitcoinity pulls from MtGox mainly, but you have a choice of other exchanges. This link, however, uses a weighted average over 24 hours: 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:01:45
you're completely right, but it is still disappointing. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 06:11:28
Yeah, I agree with the others. This kinda seems like overkill... from what I understand, it makes an address and key, then the user is supposed to copy that long string of letters onto a piece of paper to use the key. It would be a lot better if it could connect to the PC and transmit the signed transaction.

Shorting... interesting. I will read about that. Although I am guessing that you need a lot of capital to do that successfully.

I know that, but the point is that I could cash out whenever I want to. If I wanted to spend the $3000 I would be able to spend it.

The problem is, this thread is for "morons". I don't see them setting that up. But that is a good idea!
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:09:51
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:26:31
That's not a bad idea. Might do that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:59:42
How about this: Is it worth the trouble?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:14:27
This is actually partially wrong. The official Bitcoin client, Bitcoin-Qt, sends all of your coins to a "change" address whenever you ~~make a transaction~~ **send bitcoins**. Normally, the client pre creates about 100 addresses to be used as change addresses, and stores these in your wallet. This means that you should backup your wallet every 100 transactions, or every 50 if you want to be sure.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:45:50
Be sure to make backups! Chances are that whatever you bought in 2011 is worth a lot more than you expect now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:16:27
The fee that person chose to pay was silly. The default fee is 0.0005 BTC, meaning approx 12 cents. And these fees are optional also.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:35:50
I didn't make this site, and bitcoinity only shows the all time high if the current price is the high. ~~If the high is from a day or two ago, it's hard to tell exactly what it was.~~ Just thought about it, and you're completely right. Guess I won't be needing this website anymore.

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:34:33
According to example one, I believe doing this would be less risky than holding, **if done properly**. Let's say I buy/sell at 101/119. If the price was going down, 90/110, 80/100, 70/90...  then I buy at 70. and sell at 90. That's making more money than holding, where I would buying at 101 (before crash) and selling at 90 (after). 
This is just an example, and I'm not sure if it makes sense, oh well.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:51:07
I'll do it if the others don't reply to you.

there goes the majority of my potential earnings.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:29:17
No. The bid/ask there is under a dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:24:18
OK, that makes sense. Thanks. Do you have any experience doing this?
EDIT: just read the wikipedia link, 


I think what I'm talking about isn't arbitrage, but daytrading.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:55:34
Is there an export option in the client? If there is, copy what you get from there and go to import/export in blockchain and it will be possible to import  to the online blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:47:35
Thanks! This is probably my favourite comment out of the bunch.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:57:33
Two days ago, I spent $250 at btcquick and yesterday $100 at the charity donation, making $350. My wallet worth is $500. That is INSANE. If I bought some BTC when I first discovered it... that worth would be so much more. 
I fully expect a crash, maybe to $20, but I'm in it for the long run also.
Who would have thought that watching graphs can be so exciting?
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:58:17
$43.5 already. There are no words.

Every field is required, meaning if I type something in "other" I am still required to check a box.

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:37:33
Well it makes *some* sense :)
I think I will try with $50 and see what happens.
@_date: 2013-07-14 05:27:55
Yeah, I had the same country and user agent try that on my account as well earlier today. A little scary, but the account didn't have anything in it anyways.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:53:04
I think you could export the private key from your client and import the private key into the blockchain wallet, but I don't use the client so I'm not sure how to do that.
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:19:25
Thank you!

Lower fees, no invasive verification, and they accept Interac Email Money Transfers (EMTs)

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:18:38
I don't think it's exactly arbitrage, I thought that arbitrage was between two different exchanges. But I could be wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:26:05
I'm talking about a spread in one exchange, not two, with the bid/ask at the same time. Is that daytrading?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:42:07
It's a bad thing if someone thinks that's the ONLY use for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:41:45
Nope! I'm just spreading the word.
