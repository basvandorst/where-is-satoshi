[I have nothing to do with Mt Gox and have all of my bitcoins in paper wallets... I really feel for all of you guys though...](

@_date: 2015-01-15 07:01:15
Youre delusional
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:01:06
Yeah and anyway you read it wrong... the overall trend with the first two plateaus was up. The overall trend at the moment with these drops is clearly down and down hard. Miners are making more coins then there are people willing to buy them at the moment and this will just get worse...
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:49:30
I have my meager stash in paper wallets. I havent checked them for at least a year, at this point im scared to look... Ill just live in my happy world and assume that they are still there! :D
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:24:56
Then relax bro, this WILL happen again ;)
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:33:49
Spending them is easier than selling them Ive found...

Youve ticked your last tock bitches

Little things like that really make me Not Pay much notice to comments in this sub lol...

Sorry dude, that was sarcasm! Have a nice day!

Some Russians getting the F^U^C^K out of Cyprus?
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:29:46
Thank god I got in at about 40 and held onto them :D
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:05:24
a few days only... 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:56:29
I had (thank spaghetti god) nothing to do with these guys but you know what would piss me off the most about this? Words like ' circumstances beyond our control'... No, fuck that. That a lot of money, other people's money. They should be saying exactly what the fuck it's going on. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:15:27
Just ride it out bro...
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:47:45
Not true. Coin tumblers and stuff like that ive heard...
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:18:59
Thats what you think...
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:43:30
Or its a car or something and after the transaction Jack dies / Stupidly forgets or loses the Key...
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:32:14
How do I mine them? :D
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:40:35
I love SEPA in europe
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:35:42
Yeah and what you need to buy. I just happened to need a new desktop pc and had enough profit from my BTC to buy it so I just did it through bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:04:57
Save it for food bro. Only invest what you can afford to lose or something...
@_date: 2013-03-21 11:38:38
Im not, I was applying another situation to go along with your point. I meant that other things can go wrong which could prevent Amy from getting paid outside of Jack being an asshole.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:01:35
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:22:44
Fuck it, im in it for the long haul lol
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:16:43
So I should probably not post my question 'lets petition the federal reserve to accept BTC'? Answer quick, my finger is hovering over  the submit button!!
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:40:15
Theyre pretty much Adolf Bitler
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:47:37
Thank god it wasnt much...
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:20:00
Chalk and cheese brother
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:16:56
You dont even have to send them, just tell me your private key and I'll take care of it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:35:25
And where, even in the craziest of dimensions, is the advantage in them doing that?
@_date: 2013-03-16 20:28:59
And have
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:57:32
Thanks!  I suppose that together with their little login attempt history makes it prettyb secure...
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:16:36
Buy high, Lose key!
@_date: 2013-03-18 10:18:57
But if someone had each of those numbers (the addresses). Couldnt they just watch blockchain and wait for those addresses to pop up that coins have been transferred?
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:42:20
Have a nice sleep then! :D
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:42:36
Where were you between the 10th and 15th of March?

ITT: Horrible grammars
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:10:48
Im amazed not more of these people are thinking about this...
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:05:17
Hey mate,
Quick question, how does this make me more secure actually? I mean I have it but how does it work?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:09:37
Where are they slowly rising if I may?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:04:48
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:00:43
Its actually all pretty much irrelevant because you could really put as much on there as you want...
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:30:18
Guess I was thinking too small scale! (Unfortunately I couldnt read the OP due to being at work and behind 7000 proxies)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:07:23
Its just the much awaited correction for me. Every fucker who knows anything about this system knows they have been and are overvalued (for this point in time). The price really really drop (like the complete irrelevance of the system) for me to care (I sold enough coins to cover my buy in long ago...)
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:42:48
Think of your Public address as an email account and your Private key as your password to access and send emails....
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:39:40
Plus i'd wager this has a lot to do with Amazon trying to move itself into new areas - Tablets, Set top boxes for TV etc etc

They throw them into a big pie chart...
@_date: 2013-03-18 10:24:48
When that happens in 100 years Ill be a rich mother fucker
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:01:53
mine are all paper wallets, but i didnt mean i have just 40, i meant i bought them at an average of 40 euros...
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:05:20
yes :D
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:03:08
Youre luck is good because each time it came back with a vengeance...
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:20:12
Yeah im with you. Althought i wanna make money I really want to see a 1 month plateau where the price stabilises with about a 5% variance. The steeper that line gets the more nervous I get!
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:40:29
Im ok with this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:48:30
Im using it. For really anyone in Europe its pretty good with the transfers and the customer service is very good and fair. I have about 50 coins there and use the 2 factor auth. The chart is pretty good too.

Im all for fucking fraudulent banks and companies... But I just dunno if I want to defund my government right now to get that...
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:30:17
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose also kind of hits on the panicpart of it too. How many of the people falling in that trap are / were in over their head..?
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:36:18
Because there are signs that is going to happen............
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:45:39
This, dont offer/accept unless you've thought this shit through... fuck me
@_date: 2013-07-30 09:23:55
So brave...
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:29:55
Hopefully youll look back at today in a few years and say fuck yeah that bubble never popped and now ive got a nice nest egg :D
