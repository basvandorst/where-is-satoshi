Pros: You're in Greece.
Cons: You won't sell any bitcoin.

You can buy into bitcoin without having to possess/safeguard actual bitcoin.

That's nice but you probably don't want to advertise you have Bitcoin.

No, you need to read up more on Bitcoin. I don't have the time or inclination to educate you myself, but here is an ancient link that covers many of the basics:  Good day to you, sir.

Agreed! You guys would be a way better fit with us in NAFTA. No bureaucrats in Brussels telling you what cheeses you can buy or sell, or whatever it is they do there. All the English-speaking countries should form a common economic union with the free movement of people between. We share a common culture, very similar standards of living, etc. Its a no-brainer.

I agree, he's no genius. He was born at the right time, in the right place, to the right parents, etc. In the early 1990s he was wrong about the implications of the Internet. He thought Steve Ballmer would be an adequate person to take over at Microsoft. He was wrong about Bitcoin.

Kazakhstan, greatest country in the world 
All other countries are run by little girls 
Kazakhstan, number one exporter of potassium 
Other countries have inferior potassium
Kazakhstan home of dipshit swimming pool. 
Its length 30 meter, width six meter 
Filtration system a marvel to behold 
It remove 18% of human solid waste
Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice place. 
From Plains of Darashik to Northern fence of Jewtown. 
Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan. 
A very nosy people with bone in their brain.
Kazakhstan industry best in world. 
We invented toffee and trouser pants. 
Kazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the region. 
Except of course for too many scars
Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you very nice place. 
From Plains of Darashik to Northern fence of Jewtown.

Very good point. I hadn't considered the "insurance" aspect of the problem. I think you are perhaps right about that.

To each their own but to me "OpenBazaar" connotes the mystery, variety and chaos of an Arabian marketplace. It's enticing. "Purse" connotes something I desperately hope my wife doesn't ask me to hold while she tries on shoes at the mall.

Thanks for the interesting read. Sounds like you made a wise decision. 
As an aside, any perspective on why Google has been so slow-moving on Bitcoin? I would have thought they would have seized the opportunity as well.
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:19:01
"Purse" as a brand name does not work as well as "OpenBazaar"... In fact, it just doesn't work.

Good points. The utility of the Internet was obvious from suddenly not having to buy physical porno mags at gas stations etc. The nuts and bolts of http etc were irrelevant and still are for most. The problem with bitcoin is that half of people have double-digit IQs and they are usually the loudest...and often the most confident in their opinions. But sll good ideas eventually percolate to widespread acceptance.

Music companies had their head up rheir ass, and their ass buried in the sand. Remember what Sony did to musical creativity back then? And a man who was a senior banker back then was probably old and unimaginative. I'm talking about anyone under 50 back then who rushed to get their AOL fix.

I am 45 years old so was in my early/mid 20s when Internet/email etc took off. Trust me, its totally NOT true that people then saw it as useless or just a temporary fad. Pretty much everyone saw it was an incredible invention that was going to change everything. I don't know where you young punks got the notion that it wasn't widely recognized at the time. Now get off my lawn!!!
