Money changes peoples minds better than the truth.

For the applications I use my BTC for, i need faster confirmation timing. That's why I switched to Doge. 
Otherwise I'd be happy with bitcoin.

Thanks for the kind words. There actually were professors claiming most of those points. 
I'll keep up the etiquette, bitcoin trading is fun. :P

People like that are harming BTC and Doge's reputation. 
Also, NASCAR race today, check it out, the Dogecar is back!

Still it's a bit of a misconception (apologies)
BitCoin you're protected in SHA-256. In DogeCoin / Litecoin, you're protected in Scrypt. 
Both run off of a similar algorithm, but it's the mining that actually counts. 
So BitCoin is protected against all the hashing power in the SHA-256 mining market and DogeCoin / Litecoin is protected against all the hashing power in the scrypt market. 
Ultimately, both are protecting against a 51% (in most instances, 40%) attack. DogeCoin however has a bit of nifty code that bumps that number a bit before DogeCoin is affected too greatly. Even if someone gets 51% of Litecoin, Dogecoin is still fairly protected.

Then you have people like me...I used to like BitCoin a lot, and still do....but them transaction times. 
Pushed me right into the Doge. 
I still like BTC, but doge is a bit more fun for me.

shhhhhhhh.....I'm buying BTC.

Confirmation times*
It's still transaction times for me, since my applications rely on **single confirmations** for each transaction. 
I guess I just don't understand the technology, otherwise such things would be instantaneous. :P

It's all relative. 
In relation to guessing period, yes. 
In relation to relative hashing power, no. 
1MH Scrypt != 1MH SHA-256
