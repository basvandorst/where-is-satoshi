If the 'evil big banks' have intense pull over the government and the government wants to also ensure their monopoly control over the currency, they can do so by imposing high transaction taxes on bitcoin, if it is even possible for it be susceptible to regulation. Thus, effectively ending the advantages offered by bitcoin in terms of lower transaction costs.

What do crypto-currencies have to do with banking? 
Furthermore, with crypto-currencies you can have 2 sets of books. So, you can price the asset under-the table at a higher value, and this exchange will be conducted anonymously, and the asset sale, if officially reported can be priced at a much lower value, thus achieving a much lower official tax basis, if anything is to be taxed at all. 
The traditional banking system has been the same over the past century, just loopholes have been closed (you can see the situation with the swiss banks now), if a crypto-currency is designed to not be susceptible to said loopholes, then it is impossible to enforce any taxation on said crypto-currencies. If it is possible, then it is due to a flaw in those crypto-currencies that ultimately question the core fungibility, and thus sustainable commodity backing of the currency in the first place, leading to its very destruction.

You can't destroy a decentralized service, provided it is fungible.

But one person doesn't set the market. All it takes is a portion of critical mass to have an impact, which it can.
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:05:28
The market won't ignore it, and the market will automatically price in the enhanced value of the coins, hence the fungibility of bitcoin will still have been destroyed.
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:08:40
But they'll pay you less, as the values for those non-whitelisted coins will have less use-value, hence the fungibility would already have been destroyed.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:12:54
There will be automated services that will tell you which bitcoins are whitelisted and safe and which are not, the implied value of the verified bitcoin that is verified will already be higher than a non-whitelisted bitcoin. Hence, bitcoin would not already be fully fungible.
@_date: 2014-01-05 13:06:17
The point is that Bitcoin being susceptible to regulation and whitelisting, etc. in and of itself makes it susceptible to government-orchestrated intentional or unintentional attacks in the long-run.
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:51:03
That's naive idealism, they can destroy it for any number of reasons, perhaps even on impulse.
Banks can lobby the government against bitcoin, the government itself may feel as though bitcoin is a danger to their control over the money supply, etc.

Alright, I was trying to dumb it down, what people consider 'loopholes' are actually ingrained systematic processes. For instance, the rich 'capitalists' get paid on the return of capital in the form of capital gains (also dividends to an extent). So, they pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. In FDR's time it was only 25%, and in France it's now 35% for both short and long term capital gains. The US actually has a higher short-term capital gains rate than France at 43.4%, second highest on the planet, actually. That 75% tax impacts wage-earners, not the true capitalists. For instance, in France, the courts struck down a direct tax rate of 75% on individuals, however, they legitimized a 75% rate which would be paid down by the employers. Either way, governments have proven their ability to maneuver through regulatory opportunities (often politically motivated, such as the confiscation of gold), and this is a large potential danger for bitcoin and all assets that are even remotely susceptible to such opportunities. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:36:56
Yes, but zerocoin is going to be released separately as a competing crypto-currency. The point is that no flaw that potentially effects fungibility should even be built-in and distinguishable to all else in the crypto-currency, in order to sustain the commodity backing.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:49:13
The market (which includes statists) will price in the higher value of those whitelisted coins, precisely due to the protocol vulnerability, and this is a serious threat.

It was a comparatively small military project. They could have still built it off of the revenues of even land taxes. Also, see how 19th century infrastructure was built, with a much smaller government. That says nothing of the welfare state sustained by income/sales/VAT taxes.

Tor is illegal in China, for example, doesn't mean much.
If they bought it out, more could be mined, etc., but that's another issue.
And if Bitcoin hypothetically reaches a market cap of no-return, etc. etc. so stop talking about bitcoin in the context of the present day.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:47:31
Income/Sales/VAT taxation is impossible with crypto-currency. The whole infrastructure of modern taxation is largely possible due to the constraints of the modern banking/credit system. Otherwise, the forms of taxation possible, such as land taxes, will provide significantly much less revenues vs. income/sales/VAT taxes, and many small businesses are already known to understate their owed taxation, and VAT tax fraud is also well-known, this will be made much easier with crypto-currency. It will not even be possible for a welfare state to function with a properly implemented and fully functioning crypto-currency. This is what Krugman and Charlie Stross recognize.
@_date: 2014-01-05 12:18:17
People said that about FDR's 90% tax rates, didn't happen. Thing is that the regulations/taxes mainly impact ordinary middle class people, the extremely wealthy who have loopholes, tend to do fine.

It's already too late, unless the protocol itself had it built in and made it mandatory from an early stage, the currency is still vulnerable. All a government agency has to do is black-list darkwallet coins. Hence, a future cryptocurrency in which mixing is mandatory and built-in is ultimately in the long-run more viable.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:27:55
Most altcoins are simple copies of bitcoin, they don't offer any true advantages. That being said, I'm not endorsing it specifically, and the details have not yet been released, but zerocoin looks like a step in the right direction, although zerocoin itself may not be the actual successful end-currency either.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:19:53
Land Value Tax, as linked to by Charlie Stross and Krugman a few days back. The point is that if bitcoin is susceptible to taxation then it is also susceptible to being destroyed as banks and government can simply impose high transaction taxes, to effectively end its efficacy in order to ensure their monopoly control of currency.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:09:45
There still will be land taxes, which would make up the bulk of revenues provided a truly anonymous crypto-currency came into prominence, but the revenue shortfall would be massive. Government would have to dramatically decrease. And if the government has the ability to tax, they can and will tax, and if the banks lobby against whitelisted bitcoins, they can effectively end its viability, if bitcoin is even capable of being regulated.
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:59:45
It doesn't matter which forms of taxation are 'harmful', it only matters which forms of taxation are relevant. If it is deemed relevant to implement a transaction tax, then so it shall be done.

No, the government doesn't intentionally allow threats to itself. To be honest, I don't know why you even said that it would be 'economic suicide' for the US, so I just intentionally responded on a tangent.

If it is possible to enforce any type of taxes on any asset class, then it is also possible to enforce the way in which they are taxed, which extends to transaction taxes, which also can be implemented on whim. You can't have it both ways, which is what some naive idealists are trying to claim.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:57:00
You can even look at the comments and general sentiment on as it has evolved over the past few years. It was once a libertarian stronghold, now there are pro-statists everywhere even mocking libertarians wrt regulations, taxes, etc. They make up a critical mass of bitcoin users now, and they're also influential in the community, if only they accepted it, it would be enough.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:00:22
It will be impossible to ignore, the market impact will be instantly present as soon as it is initialized. That in and of itself will upset the fungibility. The government could even eventually force mtgox, etc. to ban all incoming/outgoing transactions for non-whitelisted coins for example.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:50:55
With crypto-currency, it's the same effect, you wouldn't be able to enforce sales or vat taxes for the same reason. Many small business already engage in sales tax fraud, and large and small businesses also engage in vat tax fraud, with crypto-currencies, having 2 sets of books is going to be easier.
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:14:15
Satoshi is long gone, the Bitcoin Foundation, which is 'pro-statist' is now in charge. Think about that.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:03:03
Your leverage is that your coins will be accepted by authorized merchants, be accepted for use in all transactions as recognized by the government, etc. or if your non-whitelisted coins aren't accepted, they will have less use value and therefore less market value than the white-listed coins, hence destabilizing the fungibility.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:35:41
The Banks can lobby the Federal Government to clamp down on bitcoin, and the IRS/Federal Government can enforce the measure quite easily if bitcoin can even be possibly regulated. Furthermore, the US government is not going to want to lose control over their ability to control the money supply, in any case, so the US government itself may be just as eager to put a halt to crypto-currencies as much as the banks.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:50:49
It's impossible for bitcoin to ever be FULLY regulated or controlled by any governmental agency, simply due to the fact that payments are irreversible and that crypto-currencies operate on a full-reserve system. With that said, it is certain more than possible to whitelist and destroy the fungibility of bitcoin (given that the fungibility flaws are built-in, and it's already largely too late given the amount of non-mixed coins out there), which would also destroy any fundamental valuations for the currency. Hence fitting the 'tulip bubble' analogy.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:32:28
Who cares about al capone? He's irrelevant to crypto-currency vs the traditional banking system. Do you not get the point? First of all, most services would be purchased crypto-currency to crypto-currency, businesses would under-report sales if any, and they would also pay their suppliers at lower-rates, if any official reports, etc. This will translate into customers buying services anonymously.
So, even if you had a house for 1mil on sale, you can officially report the sale at $80,000 and pay taxes on that, if anything, and then the rest can be paid under-the-table anonymously to none the wiser. So, all the cars/houses purchased, etc. would be at below the official market rate, if anything is reported at all, and all else cannot be traced. Even salaries can officially be under-reported if any reports are to be made, etc. So, the whole system turned upside down, and impossible to track or enforce by any measure. Krugman understands this.
This has never been possible before through the traditional banking system, and any loopholes which are closed in the traditional banking system are irrelevant to decentralized crypto-currencies. It's like comparing dropbox or an official file hosting service to bittorrent, doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-01-05 13:29:34
Then other governments will also implement whitelisting, etc. just the same, the fungibility of bitcoin will already have been destroyed in any case.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:21:55
Companies can under-report and have 2 sets of books, most businesses are small businesses, and they do so, bitcoin will make it easier. So, tax will only be effectively levied on land, tariffs and excise taxes, poll taxes and natural resource taxes.

Neither sales taxes nor VAT nor income taxes will be possible to enforce as companies already cheat on sales and vat taxes by underreporting.

With upcoming crypto-currencies that will have mandatory mixing built-in, they will actually be conclusively effectively less trackable than cash (this will end the debate), as even cash has serial numbers, and since bitcoin transactions are irreversible, all one has to day is transfer into bitcoins and then transfer into any other crypto-currency of their choosing if bitcoin remains effectively formally legal.

How am I against Bitcoin? I'm saying that crypto-currencies have promise, but bitcoin has serious fungibility issues, that's why it isn't equivalent to Gold. And, at the end of the day, it was drug money that prevented bitcoin's value from hitting zero after the first collapse.
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:52:42

@_date: 2013-12-29 02:47:05
Bingo. I agree with you. The issue with bitcoin is that it is susceptible to whitelisting, and this can lead to the destruction of its fungibility which overwrites and destabilizes the bitcoin market concept of '21 million fungible coins'. Future developments like zerocoin look more promising. Truly anonymous crypto-currencies are the future. Then you can barter anything for them and the transfers cannot be tracked.

Given VAT tax evasion is already an issue in countries that have it, not even the VAT could be enforced as companies could simply pay each other under-the-table more easily. So, basically, it would be down to land taxes, natural resource taxes and tariff and excise taxes. You are correct that government will have to majorly shrink and that companies/industries that depend on subsidies will have to take a hit.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:29:18
Banning it would be better for bitcoin in the long-run as that would ensure fungibility. Creating whitelisting services and coin validation would result in the destruction of bitcoin altogether, as the core black market liquidity (who originally used bitcoin in the first place precisely due to anonymity and assumed fungibility of bitcoins a la a commodity like gold) will move to another improved crypto-currency and in the next panic, there will be nothing left backing bitcoin and preventing it from going to zero.

It's stupid meme to say that bitcoin is more traceable than cash. Cash isn't comparable to bitcoin, the traditional banking system is. Even when you had a numbered bank account, it meant nothing if you didn't mix and cut off the flow of funds, otherwise they would be tracked to their source, just the same. Bitcoin is made anonymous through the use of mixing services, and each address functions like a now non-existent numbered swiss bank account on its own. With upcoming crypto-currencies, there will be mixing built-in, so they will be completely anonymous 100%.

Then who is going to even want to convert currency to bitcoin in the first place to buy products from those merchants who accept bitcoin? People who have already used it for illicit goods largely as that makes up the bulk of the bitcoin liquidity.
This article is dated later than yours:
Yes, Bitcoin is based on money laundering, because it is based on the transactions of drugs, which are illegal, and therefore not applicable to the taxation which is required by the state.
And again, I brought up the bitcoin collapse in the past which was only sustained by the liquidity provided by the drug market, so the percentage at that point for drug transactions, directly, would have been much higher. And it will revert to those levels in future collapses as well. It's core liquidity that sustains a currency, and bitcoin's core liquidity is based on drugs.

@_date: 2013-12-29 05:21:12
They need probable cause to even consider holding you in contempt. Otherwise, they can't legally do anything. With crypto-currencies, since it is anonymous and decentralized, they can't obtain any probable cause, unlike in the traditional system where accounts can physically be traced back to your name, etc.

Bitcoin is used because it can be anonymous to avoid government regulations for certain prohibited goods, the fact that bitcoin is not fully-anonymous is a specific detriment to bitcoin and is why bitcoin cannot be compared to gold, because gold is fungible, any piece of physical gold is the same as any other, the same isn't true for bitcoin, which can be subjected to whitelisting.

How will they be able to legally freeze your assets?

How are they going to prove you posess those bitcoins and that you legitimately didn't lose them?

Crypto-currencies do not.
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:55:55
Why are you so obsessed with FBARs? There is no regulation requiring you to file FBARs for bitcoins, and even if you do report mtgox proceeds, which still isn't even a requirement, once you transfer your mtgox account to actual bitcoin addresses, mtgox looses all control.
As I told you before, you can't compare bitcoins to offshore accounts where names/identities are tied to everything and where there can be probable cause based on those banking documents.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:35:41
What burden of proof will they have for money laundering? Like I said, with the other example and with ALL money laundering cases through the traditional system, there was a direct physical link and connections to offshore banks, etc. which were actually tracked with bank accounts with real names, etc., but with bitcoins, there is no paper-trail, so no probable cause.
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:22:52
How would they know how much you have in bitcoin, especially if it is mixed? People lose and make money in crypto-currency all the time. You don't have to report the bitcoins you possess for normal taxation purposes, you just need to report capital gains on the earnings, but if you keep your wealth in bitcoins, you don't need to report anything. For the exit tax on your net wealth, you can say you lost those bitcoins.

If bitcoin fungibility is questioned and white listing is implemented then bitcoin will cease to exist as a currency, and the next improved crypto-currency will be embraced. This is what separates bitcoin from gold at this point, as with gold, every physical unit can be exchanged for another. And services like SR, etc. already evade government regulations with bitcoin through the use of mixing services which anonymize bitcoin transactions. So bitcoin does defy government regulation and hence defies taxation.

I'm talking about the banking system. 100 years ago the system was the same, the only difference is that the swiss government, etc. didn't comply with requests regarding money laundering/tax evasion, now it does. So, the traditional architecture of the banking system remains the same, the only difference is that governments like switzerland now enforce regulations that they previously didn't do, but the mechanism to launder money through the traditional banking system has always remained. Now, as for why paper money ended up succeeding vs. commodity-backed currency, paper money had a lower transaction cost, so it was more efficient to use paper-money, with crypto-currency, transaction costs are also lower, however, if governments step in and say that you can only use abc-xyz addresses and whitelist, they can then also retroactively impose transaction costs on those addresses to users of the currency, thus nullifying advantages. This is why crypto-currencies that are susceptible to regulation are not safe in the long-run.
Regulation never found away around Bittorrent or TOR, regulation is irrelevant to decentralized services. The internet is not decentralized, it's still largely based on an old legacy system of public infrastructure, however the goodwill developed on top of it can be fully-decentralized. What you fail to understand is that regulation 'doesn't simply find a way', they just close loopholes that can exist. See Murphy's Law. However, with upcoming currencies like zerocoin, and given bitcoin's immunity to have reversed transactions, regulation is irrelevant to technologies that fundamentally break it. It's like trying to regulate texting, but then people use open-source IM services to get around it.
It is irrelevant whether anyone thinks a substitute exists, the scenario will be forced upon when the time comes. The same thing happened during the transition from gold to paper money and eventually fiat paper money, which allowed for the welfare system to eventually come into being in the first place, through easier records of transactions in the banking system, and therefore introducing mechanisms to more easily tax those transactions. However, bitcoin, unlike even gold, is completely digital and not even a physical property than can be seized or looted, so in that sense, it is a more revolutionary means of exchange.

If you're insinuating murphy's law, then that's why the protocol should have been engineered to require mandatory mixing, a la the up-and-coming zerocoin, so bitcoin may not be the future of crypto-currency, but rather more like an alpha-napster like version compared to modern-day bittorent. Every argument that can be made as a counter to mixing services is also a counter to the fungibility of bitcoin. Gold, for example, is completely fungible, if you melted stolen gold down and mixed and reconstituted it, no one would be able to tell the difference. A truly effective crypto-currency is going to require these fungible commodity properties, otherwise, xyz government can  mandate that you use these verified whitelisted addresses and that you retroactively also pay large transaction taxes, for example, which defeats the low transaction cost advantage of bitcoin. Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong eventually.

No, FBARs are exclusively for financial accounts:

That's why I brought up mixing, in which transactions are cut-off, and with zerocoins, mixing is built in, so that will be legitimately next-to-impossible to track. If you legitimately lose 1 million in gambling or investing for example, you cannot legally be held  for what you lost. You're taxed based on capital GAINS/losses.

Gold is not a currency, it's a commodity, and fiat currency is superior to gold for transactions. Bitcoin is not even comparable as a virtual commodity because it has fungibility issues, and bitcoin is not a physical property so if the use-value collapses there is no limit to its decline in value with the exception of the core liquidity backing it. My article is more accurate because it accounts for the broad-market, your article isn't accurate because it ignores the speculation booms, during the height of the last bubble drug use would have been less compared to the bottom, so what? Speculation doesn't equal any value anymore than speculation meant during the tulip bubble. What held the bottom was the drug use. Same thing for the modern bubble. Bitcoin is not a store of value, its a cryptocurrency, without any use, a currency has no value. And money transfer fees are offset by volatility/instability at this point, which I have mentioned. People can use bitcoins for anything, but it's not as as convenient when you already have fiat currency, bitcoin's prime market is precisely dedicated to flirt the restrictions imposed on fiat currency, hence its basis on money laundering/tax evasion. Kill that market, you kill bitcoin.

It would be difficult to formally outlaw bitcoin in the same fashion that it would be difficult to outlaw bittorrent. It's just a protocol, nothing else. With bartering, which you can do with moneypaks/gift cards, etc. it's nearly impossible to shutdown. Before legitimate business can kick-off in bitcoin, core liquidity must be provided by a service that isn't available otherwise (the competitive advantage of crypto-currencies vs traditional currencies, transaction cost advantages can only come after liquidity and pricing stabilization). Governments have attempted to shutdown underground drug services similar to what they have done with torrent sites, but with tor decentralization, etc. it becomes exceedingly difficult, even for a country with the resources and initiative like China.

Yes, the Government defines the rules of the game. Prostitution is illegal, for example. And the way the government often prosecutes the usage of prohibited goods is through 'tax evasion', because you see, the good can't be taxed, and the government doesn't allow the taxation of it.

That was a spelling error, I'm surprised you're responding so fast all of a sudden. They can win if they have evidence, like in the other case where the guy sent money to accounts in his name, yet he claimed not to be in possession of those accounts. Traditional banking can be reversed and identities are assigned to accounts, crypto-currency cannot and no identities are assigned to addresses.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:12:12
Most businesses are small businesses and they are well-known for evading taxes and the only way to defeat mixing is to go to whitelisting, which again, questions the fungibility of the currency, thus making bitcoin not equivalent to a commodity such as gold, in that case, if the fungibility  of bitcoin is broken, then the currency is effectively nothing more than tulips as critics have suggested as it won't withstand its basis of '21 million fungible coins'. Up and coming crypto-currencies and services like zerocoin are going to have mixing built-in.
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:06:40

There's 10,000 transaction limit for SAR reports, so they know how much money was transacted into bitcoins. They don't know how much you currently possess in bitcoins. You can say you purchases consulting services, or that you lost them, etc, or that you gambled, or that you made bad investments speculating in the futures markets inside of bitcoin, etc.
If you send 5,000,000 to mtgox and exchange for bitcoins, they know that's how much you sent to mtgox, they don't know how much bitcoins you necessarily currently possess and the market value for those coins.
That's because I told you before, no one moves millions in the traditional system on a regular basis outside of the banking system, except for some  drug launderers who try to layer CASH. However, all of those bank transactions can be tracked, as ownership can be checked on those accounts, there is no such verification process in bitcoins.

Why are people so offended by this notion? How is it not true? What prevented bitcoin from falling to zero after the first collapse?

Bitcoin offers no value for mainstream purchases over fiat currency, as it is all priced the same. The only value that bitcoin can provide is sales tax evasion, for example, but that would also group bitcoin purchases into the same category as the also illegal SR. The only reason non-drug goods are being purchased in bitcoin is largely due to the income generated by drugs.

There is a market for services in bitcoins, gambling services, you can pay people for services, buy goods, consulting, speculate in futures/fx markets, which are known to be highly volatile, and highly susceptible to huge gains/declines on account of margin.

You have it backwards. Those lessened Fees are offset by instability/volatility, it's only after critical mass and bitcoin pricing stabilization that those fees can become a marketable reason.

@_date: 2013-12-29 02:36:36
If whitelisting is enabled, then bitcoin will lose fungibility and so the drug money that provided core liquidity sustained during the last collapse will no longer be available for the next collapse to prevent bitcoin from hitting zero. People will move their funds to other more improved crypto-currencies with built-in mixing. So, if bitcoins aren't fungible a la gold, then they lose their commodity basis which allows them to have their value and the currency shall be destroyed.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:20:08
It's not possible to be removed from government control while simultaneously ensuring that the government has the ability to tax. That's how alcohol/tobacco products are regulated for example, it all comes down to taxes.
Bitcoin is already largely underground with the silk road and its the liquidity generated by the black market which helped Bitcoin during the last crash, hence why it didn't hit zero.
Average joes who deal with bitcoins for non-speculation purposes are largely using it to purchase drugs from services like the Silk Road, and given that government requires taxation on all services rendered, and that drugs can't be legally taxed, they are therefore also implicated in facilitating money laundering by using services such as SR. It comes down to convenience, necessity , marketability and practicality. Bitcoin must cover all fronts in order for it to be a true threat to fiat currencies.
As for the government, it's largely due to government regulations why these privacy technologies have been developed at an accelerated rate. Look at what thepiratebay is doing. The more the government opposes it, the quicker technological progress will come at the rate it's going now.

It proves gold's fungibility as it can't be physically distinguished. As for Bitcoin, as far as anyone knows, you can say that someone donated the bitcoins to you, and the onus would be on the regulators to prove otherwise, with which if it came in through a mixing service, it couldn't be tracked. Offshore banks don't mix, that's what concentration accounts do, but the difference is with banking is that no matter how many code names you may use, ultimately there will be an account that uses your real name, with bitcoin, there isn't. And if whitelisting succeed,s then bitcoin's fungibility will be questioned, which will lead to its destruction, and liquidity will move to the next improved crypto-currency.

They can use mixing services and the entire block-chain is cut-off, you can't do that easily for small transfers with bank accounts.

The reason why bitcoin withstood the last collapse was the result of a core amount of liquidity which was largely to certain market transactions in the currency, i.e. bitcoin had use-value for drug purchases so it could not decline to zero. The reason why bitcoin was chosen was precisely to evade current regulations, by implementing whitelisting and the destruction of fungibility, you destroy the implied digital commodity nature (i.e. it ceases to be a fungible commodity such as gold), so those funds would then shift to a new improved currency. There is a massive difference with the current banking system, because, ultimately there are ownership records. No matter how many shell corporations you go through and no matter how many concentration accounts you use, there will always that 1 account that has your real name and credentials. With Bitcoin, there are no such requirements.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:18:33
A store of value doesn't generate liquidity, the tulips were also a store of value in the tulip bubble, it didn't mean much after the collapse, the same thing happened with the bitcoin collapse. And I already told you for which you don't have an explanation, once you factor in volatility/instability, the transaction cost point becomes null at this level. It's only drug use/money laundering that is made more convenient with bitcoin. And no, it isn't cash, otherwise silk road type websites wouldn't be making in-roads on that cash market, you would instead have the opposite according to your theory. Cash is difficult to maneuver  because you have deposit/withdrawal limits.

The problem is that people aren't thinking about how governments will be able to enforce such measures. A Bitcoin Address is basically like a now non-existent numbered swiss bank account. There is no identity attached to it, and through the use of mixing services, it becomes entirely anonymous, which is how SR and other similar services are able to work. Keep in mind that the majority of businesses are small businesses and they are often known to engage in tax-evasion related practices.

Those people will still have to take a currency risk which will cost them when you take into account the volatility/instability in the price, so which market does that leave for the merchants? In that case, they might as well go with fiat currency. People who already acquired btc for the drug market and are spending their excess. If bitcoin has no use-value like tulips, and the drug market went away, then following the next collapse, the value would go to zero, but the drug market specifically saved bitcoin following the collapse. Bitcoin was and is used for drugs still even predominantly which is confirmed by the article I gave which is later dated than yours, and again, I mentioned if you were take a proportion of the drug market during the last mania and measured it vs the bottom, their would be a higher proportion for drug use at the bottom, simply because empty speculation is meaningless and does not provide any use value anymore than a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin can be anonymous due to mixing services, if the fungibility of bitcoin is questioned due to whitelisting, etc. then bitcoin will no longer be used as a currency by the drug market that is providing core liquidity to bitcoin as they will more onto a truly fungible crypto-currency. This is why bitcoin cannot be considered a true commodity like gold, bitcoin is non-fungible and subject to arbitrary physical valuation destruction based on each specific coin. Whereas with gold, or a cryptocurrency that provides premixed coins, it's not possible to make those distinctions. Each unit of gold has to be treated like every other. Bitcoin's liquidity is almost entirely dependent upon drugs as it was picked by a niche who used it to evade using fiat currency, which before was liberty reserve/egold, etc.

How can you prove something that you're physically incapable of proving? Some people do genuinely forget foreign bank accounts, but the IRS tracks them due to names/identity information assigned to them, you can't do that with crypto-currency.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:33:11
The fact that bitcoin doesn't have built-in mixing, unlike what some future currencies can have is a detriment not a benefit. Bitcoin is assumed on the idea of 21 million fungible mined coins of equal value. White-listing would completely destroy the commodity like properties, thus remove the qualifications and question the legitimacy of the whole currency. If the government wanted to impose a transaction tax for every bitcoin, they could, and if the banks lobbied the government to do this, it could destroy bitcoin and all other crypto-currencies that aren't inherently anonymous.
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:00:49
There has never really been a cat and mouse game, the traditional banking system was always consistent. You transferred a sum from account abc to xyz and then the intermediate funds could be traced or not depending upon how effectively they were laundered and mixed. All that happened was standardization of the regulation of the system through OECD regulations, so nothing important was developed that fundamentally changed the system and reversibility is understood as being an inherent part of the traditional banking system. 
With Bitcoin, you have a scenario where all accounts/addresses are anonymous by default and it can be made completely anonymous through the use of mixing. With Zerocoin, mixing is built-in, so you have complete anonymity for every transaction. Businesses won't need fiat if they can do all there transactions through crypto-currency, and hold assets like stock futures, etc. in bitcoins (all anonymously) and also hedge their exposure through the use of fx futures in bitcoins. If you destroy the fungibility of bitcoin you destroy any commodity backing value of the currency a la Gold, as the '21 mil fungible coins' concept becomes null. And the thing about bitcoin, say even if zerocoins were illegal, but bitcoins were legal, it's irrelevant, the very fact that bitcoin transactions are irreversible makes it possible for a person to easily exchange bitcoins for zerocoins or whatever else.  If it can be taxed, then it can be destroyed indirectly through whitelisting issues which question the fungibility required for the commodity backing, if it can't always be taxed, then it leaves room to maneuver for serious tax evasion. With crypto-currencies it will not be possible to tax income or sales. Only land, tariffs and excise taxes, poll taxes and natural resources taxes could effectively be conducted, with land accounting for the bulk of taxation, governments will have to massively shrink in size, the welfare state won't be possible. 
You can't have a fractional reserve system simultaneously competing with a full-reserve system (like bitcoins) simultaneously. If Bitcoin/crypto-currency becomes mainstream, then the entire economic order will be upset.  That's why krugman is technically correct when he says that bitcoin is a danger to the tax system and the welfare state.  Also, decentralized exchanges would make exchange issues null, but even then, you would also be able to transact gift cards/moneypaks, etc. for crypto-currencies through even tor-hosted non-decentralized exchanges.
