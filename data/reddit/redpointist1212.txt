Most things in Bitcoin require the consent of the miners, thats how bitcoin works. Do you like hardforks better? You must not be looking forward to segwit then.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:11:55
If it's clear the rate has slowed dramatically you can always decrease the growth rate. And it only takes a SOFTFORK to decrease blocksize, so it's much easier to do it.
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:25:46
You don't really have anything to contribute to the discussion, do you?
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:24:03
So what happens in a few years when everyone's bandwidth is 50% faster but we're stuck at 2MB blocks? Core's viewpoint seems to be "sorry, hardfork too dangerous, here use this lightning network and set up a channel/account with a lightning hub instead." But we could easily move 50% more transactions onchain at that point. If not something like BU, we need a percent increase per year that matches average bandwidth growth so we don't need to discuss blocksize again for a longtime. 
How does Core plan to softfork us another blocksize increase several years down the road when it is inevitably needed? The moving the witness data trick only works once, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:11:47
It's just keeping in line with the growth of computing power, storage, and bandwidth, which all grow exponentially.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:00:54
Fair enough, but the difference here is that Roger's interest lines up squarely with raising the price of bitcoin because the majority of his fortune is tied up in Bitcoin. While I don't think blockstream is neccesarily nefarious, when you consider their funding is in USD, investors are largely banks, and their profit potential is in offchain payment channels, you see their interests don't line up exactly with a higher bitcoin price like Roger's interests do, and they even seem to have a direct conflict of interest when it comes to on chain vs offchain scaling. And that's why blockstream's influence is more questionable than Roger's.

Well for one thing I have pretty crap internet, and running a full node at 1mb is a cakewalk. What makes you think 2mb is unsafe? I'm sure you've explained before. Care to link?
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:04:22


 
Maybe for now, but bandwidth rates are more than doubling every seven years. In 50 years, all indications point to the fact that 300MB blocks will download at least as fast then as 2MB blocks do now (based on 10% bandwidth speed growth per year, which is pretry conservative). And then at that point you've achieved the mythical 2000 tps VISA throughput with ONLY blocksize increases. Things like Schnorr signatures and 2nd layer solutions are great, but the longterm affect of increasing blocksize to reflect the resources available shouldn't be overlooked.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:02:01
So his assumption is that the storage cost of the entire blockchain needs to stay constant forever. I think it would be more reasonable to shoot for a constant yearly cost. For instance, the blockchain is expanding at, what, 50GB per year? That's $15 a year to keep up with the blockchain growth. Longterm some kind of pruning scheme will likely mitigate storage costs.
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:51:10
What do you mean by a small group? Does this small group need to meet a hash power threshold for this to work? How high is the threshold? How big would this small group have to be to do it on a sub-1mb bitcoin? (Btw, I question your assumption that decreasing blocksize would result in a significant increase in full nodes. Maybe you get 5% more nodes at the expense of sacrificing a potentially 400% higher throughput. Most people's needs are simply met without running a full node, so even if you make it marginally easier to run one, most people still have no reason to do it. We're making  economic predictions at this point.)
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:01:37
Then you effectively have a 70% activation threshold. You might as well say, "If we manage to get 51%, then 95% isn't far away."

Are you saying you think we'll all be using a sidechain that becomes the new mainchain? We'll still have to deal with the blocksize issue in the new sidechain, would we not?
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:13:52
The one time bump to 2mb  from segwit isnt enough longterm. I'm asking about future plans because if Core's longterm plan is 2mb from segwit + 40% more from Schnorr signatures and then lightning network to infinity....a hardfork blocksize increase is inevitable even for Lightning network to function at significantly higher capacitys, correct?
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:42:12
That's pretty fucking rich. Here's what Satoshi, the designer of Bitcoin, had to say about the issue.
"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware."
"It can be phased in, like:
If (block number &gt; 115000)
maxblocksize=larger limit"
A blocksize limit hardfork was part of the original design and plan by its creator. For you to sit here and say if a blocksize hardfork occured, it would no longer be Bitcoin, and that you have some kind of divine right to the name, is absolutely delusional. You think that people trying to implement the original plan are the ones trying to hijack the network? You must be trolling...
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:45:14
I think even most big blockers agree that a 2nd layer solution is needed eventually, so the quote doesnt seem very controversial to me. 
The question comes down to whether we need to force people onto 2nd layers ASAP because bigger blocks harm decentralization immediately (small blockers), or if we should allow on chain growth to continue for some time because there is still significant headroom in blocksize until decentralization is actually affected in a meaningful way (big blockers).
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:40:16
If SPV doesnt exist, then how do you explain electrum? SPV obviously exists, but a fully trustless solution hasn't been developed yet. I could just as easily say that Lightning network doesn't exist and is impossible because the centralized routing problem hasn't been solved yet. It's clear every word you type is twisted to fit your preconceived agenda. True, the simple and direct blocksize increase quote was from later, but the other quote was one of the first, if not the first correspondence from Satoshi and shows clear intent for blocksize to grow beyond a low end user's capacity to run a full node. You're a fanatic, comparing big blockers with the violence of IS. Unbelievably stupid. Sounds like you need to get outside for a bit. I wish I could say that it's been nice speaking with you, but it hasnt. Good day sir.
@_date: 2017-02-10 04:29:08
Yes, that's what many small blockers believe. Isn't that basically what I said they believe?
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:09:07
When lightning network actually has a completely trustless and decentralized routing mechanism, then you can complain to me about SPV nodes not being trustless and perhaps have a point. Also, we all three agree that miners "dont make the rules" ultimately the economic majority makes the rules. I said that miners could force a hard fork, I never said that if they did that with no economic support that it'd be a good idea for them to do that.
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:57:41
Lol, so you want to play word games with who gets to keep the name if there's a contentious split? Does it fucking matter what you or me thinks about who keeps the name? LMFAO
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:47:38
Sure, full nodes can always reject the majority hashpower and start an altcoin with a new proof of work, but that doesnt change the fact that the miners forced a hard fork. Of course forcing an unpopular hardfork in this manner would obviously be a stupid thing to do because now their coins are worth less.
Edit: Why do you think that raising the blocksize to the point that orphaned blocks are causing other miners to have to shut down would be beneficial for this hypothetical miner cartel? Wouldn't this be obvious and the price would drop the reflect the weakened state of the network? Bitcoin his based on rational self interest and I can't see a scenario where it'd be in anyones rational self interest to launch such an attack. And if they did want to launch such an attack, they could do so today, regardless of what the rest of us plan for the block size. The economic incentive to not damage the network is the only thing preventing that even today, so I don't see how you think its relevant to the decisions we should make for the future.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:49:12
The majority of humans that use bitcoins obviously want an increase in blocksize. It's pretty easy to see the direction needed to go, it's how far that's the issue. Its obviously hard to get a reliable measure but Id bet for every Luke jr that wants a decrease there are at least 100 that want some kind of increase, by any metric you choose.
Do you have a link to his data? I'd agree that the transaction growth rate before hitting the 1mb cap was probably at an unsustainable level, but I'd be interested if he has any actual data that supports his ideas that 2mb, or even 1mb are not safe baselines to start with today.
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:01:51

I never said it'd be easy, I said a softfork adjustment is easier to get consensus than a hardfork adjustment. Obviously when your wanting to move the opposite direction than the majority you're not getting anywhere with a softfork or a hardfork, but if you're in the ballpark, a softfork is a lower hurdle to clear.

In bitcoin, miners have veto power over everything. If there was some malicious miner majority trying to centralize further, they could start mining 20mb blocks today. If 51% of miners want to fuck you over, they will, whether you offer a hardfork or softfork doesnt change that. Welcome to bitcoin, which assumes 51% of miners have their interests aligned with bitcoin's interests, a state that is encouraged by the fact that the miners are paid in bitcoins. Seems to work pretty well.
 Obviously 1 of these states is true: either there is no malicious miner majority, or if there is, it's not in their interest to increase blocksize to a level that is harmful to the network.

You give me a little too much credit. I didn't come up with the idea of using a percent increase in blocksize...LukeJR used it in his recent proposal for instance, which has code. I don't know why you keep focusing on MY 50 year predictions, MY plan, MY code. Can you just discuss the concepts without dragging me into it and looking for Ad Hominems? Thanks.


Im talking about SHA256 and ECDSA if you couldn't guess. You want to sit here and nitpick with me the difference between hash and encryption when it isn't even relevant to the discussion? Don't you have anything better to do?


Wow you're using math? Too bad all those people who calculated that average yearly bandwidth speed increases haven't ever dropped below 10% in the history of bandwidth weren't using math. If only we could calculate some kind of reasonable estimate from that historical data.
Its obvious you have no useful input and are only seeking to argue...poorly, if I might add. Go troll someone else, buddy.
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:34:56
Oh geez, future uncertainty...guess we should just not do anything because we can't be certain how it'll turn out....great argument. In case you didn't know, Homo Sapiens has a neat talent of being able to make reasonable estimations of future conditions based on current conditions.
Its funny, you act like if we add in a 10% yearly blocksize growth rate now, we're locked in and can't change it for 50 years. If it ever become a problem, it would only take a soft fork to reduce it.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:22:27
And even then you still increased faster than average bandwidth speed, so that's good.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:01:14
No, you dont have to wait 50 years. You set the blocksize to increase 10% per year and you reap the benefits continuously.
The other resources such as storage capacity and processing speed are increasing even FASTER than bandwidth speed, so by definition bandwidth IS THE bottleneck. The estimate also doesn't even include things like Schnorr signatures (40% boost) or any other improvements to onchain scaling that may be developed in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:59:39
Why be so dense? Set the yearly increase now and you reap the benefits of increasing bandwidth speeds continuously. Something like Schnorr Sigs give you a one time bump, but bandwidth growth gives you a bump every.fucking.year. It can't be ignored.
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:24:18
So you want 2MB blocks....FOREVER? Is that reasonable when bandwidth growth is 10% per year? In 53 years my grandkids could have 300MB blocks which download as fast for them as 2mb blocks download for me. That would get us near the mythical 2000tps VISA throughput in my lifetime. Why does no one think about this longterm?

Thats an interesting statement considering Bitcoin hasnt even been around for most of an average person's life. It seems to me that economics didnt even register on most of these people's radars until a few years ago, let alone most of their lives. If you are 18 years old and got into bitcoin when you were, perhaps 12 or something, maybe it would feel that way for you, but then you'd be the exception rather than the rule. If part of what you say is true, and these Devs are furiously studying economic effects, perhaps it would be more efficient to spend their time doing things they're actually already good at, like increasing the efficiency of the software, and finding ways to use software to do new useful and exciting things, and outsource the study of economic effects of various conditions out to a group that already has experience in those things and have studied these things in the past. It seems ludicrous to me that Blockstream is paying someone like G. Maxwell to study economics, (edit: not) do market research, and attempt PR on reddit, when they could easily hire people who are much better at those things, so that GMax could actually focus on the software, which he is great at.


I would hope you'd use *actual* data. The problem is you aren't using anywhere near *enough* data to make any real conclusions. So you noticed a correlation between blocksize and node count. Great. Did you make any attempt to prove causation, or is correlation good enough for you? How much of this affect was due to increased cost to run a node, and how much of the affect was due to there simply being an ever increasing amount of, and usability of, alternatives to a full node (your competition in this case) such as light wallets and regulated exchanges. How much of the drop was due to the fact that mining was no longer profitable for them, reducing many people's need to run a node, rather than node cost making it prohibitive for them? Did you even attempt to quantify any of this? Did you conduct any market research to actually ask users what it is thats driving their decisions? These are the kinds of things that software developers who are studying economics in their spare time just arent going to get around to doing (Edit: Do you realize that there are people who have spent many times Bitcoin's lifespan studying the topic of whether missed sales expectations (your node count in this case) were due to increased competition (full node alternatives), price sensitivity (increased node cost), or external factors (decrease in mining for instance)? Market research has been woefully ignored by these developers who apparently wish to be seen as experts on the matter).
Its great that an effort is being made, but its also good to recognize the limits of your expertise rather than let ego tell you you can do it all alone. The division of labor is part of what makes humans so effective. But by all means, at least dont dismiss everyone, as the original poster does, who's not a computer science expert when you're largely discussing an economic issue.

How does this "have nothing to do with developers" when it's impossible for users to run code if there isn't a large group of developers who have already written and tested the code? It's not possible for users to spontaneously develop code that suits their needs, they can only accept or reject what has been presented. BU has provided a GUI in which its possible for users to adjust this controversial variable to suit their needs, because it has been proven that developers are unwilling or unable to create acceptable code to address this issue.

@_date: 2017-03-16 23:20:14
Do you have any proof that the emergent consensus concept fails unless the miners are highly centralized? It seems to me that even in a highly decentralized mining environment, a small self interested miner sets his settings to a reasonable value that makes it unlikely that he ends up rejecting blocks that a majority are accepting. That's the emergent part of the idea, that individual miners will converge on a common value.

They only "revealed it themselves" by fixing the bug in the dev branch of their git, but they hadn't even released a hotfix for their users yet, so peters public announcement of the bug served no purpose but to alert attackers to the vulnerability. He tweeted at 10:26am. Nodes started going down after 10:30am and really picked up at 10:45am.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:23:18
The risk is their block being orphaned and losing 12.5 bitcoins if the chain advocating for the bigger blocks does not manage to get 12 blocks ahead of the chain rejecting the bigger blocks. The only situation in which that wouldnt be a strong deterent is if the miners pushing the bigger block chain had well over 50% hashpower and didn't care what users think or if users abandon their chain, and if those conditions were true they'd be mining bigger blocks today and not bothering with BU at all. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:38:04
The OP implies that if we get BU we will have no block limit. This is not functionally true. The miners have an interest in having transaction fees be nonzero, so they will limit the blocksize so that fees make up for the diminishing block reward over time, making inflation unneccesary. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:16:21

Users have the ultimate power in either Core or BU. With Core, a few devs with little economically at stake decide and then users can run Core or not. In BU miners decide and then users can decide to run BU or not.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:28:40
Isn't that incentive to drive up fees balanced by the desire to maximize the size of the block reward by increasing the value of Bitcoin? It seems like blocking onchain scaling is a good way to limit the price of bitcoin, and therefore the block reward that makes up most of their income.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:32:16
Lower it to 30%?
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:15:15
Again, I can say the same thing about Core. Core has all the power and users have none unless the users are willing to assert their power and veto Core. The amount of power users has remains the same, you're just shifting the initial decision from Core devs (who have comparatively little at stake economically) to miners (who have much more at stake in determining the ideal block size).
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:21:04
It seems the bigger risk is going all in on a chain who's value could go to almost 0 if they pick the wrong side, especially if both sides currently have similar value, which is the only scenario in which the exchanges support would matter. If a chain is getting re-orged then it must not have all that much value anyways so not much harm done as long as they are also supporting the side that won.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:11:43
Just because he's a BU dev doesnt mean he had a stopwatch going when they updated the dev branch and stopped it when the attack started, and it doesnt mean he was thinking at the time about how the exact time of the attack relative to Todd tweet might relate to Todd's culpability in it.
The Devs imply in your screenshot that if they had hidden it with other stuff it would have "slipped by ptodd and we wouldn't have this disaster". That says to me that they think Todd's tweet might have precipitated the attack.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:04:56

Sure, he says:


But again, I don't think anyone would disagree with that statement. People disagree on the specifics. For instance, everyone would disagree that trying to get VISA level throughput today would need I dunno...300 MB blocks, and decrease (destroy) bitcoin's decentralized security model. But other people believe that, say...4MB, would quadruple throughput and still have plenty of decentralization to keep its censorship resistance.
Personally, I think people overlook the LONGTERM potential of onchain scaling. For instance, starting at 4mb and at a average bandwidth increase of 10% per year, we can have VISA level transactions ONCHAIN in 46 years. and I'll probably still be alive by then too. Do we need something like Lightning Network to bridge the gap tull then? Sure, but don't neglect onchain scaling because eventually technology will catch up to the point that even VISA level throughput is possible.

@_date: 2017-03-15 01:15:08
Nope, doesnt prove they weren't running BU. The guy who's node stayed up for a few hours after the attack started was running BU the whole time. Why didn't his node crash immediately when we had the big drop in node count? Clearly the exploit didn't affect all BU nodes equally, and mining nodes often make minor tweaks to the software for their own purposes, but they're still running the software.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:03:18
How do you know it didn't cause anyone financial harm? There's a distinct possibility that someone was mining with BU, their node crashed, and they lost money.
Edit: also, Peter didn't find the bug, he just tweeted about it after the bug had been found by BU devs but before it had been fixed. So most of your scenarios are moot.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:00:18


Perhaps, but how much will segwit actually limit UTXO bloat? This dev thinks not very much:

@_date: 2017-03-15 03:47:28
Not always, if a bug is not currently being exploited, its often much better to roll out a patch quietly bundled with several other changes to fix it before its noticed by an attacker. Peter definitely did no one a service here, especially since he drew attention to the bug, *before the hotfix was even available for users*.

I don't think blockstream specifically is, but alot of small blockers seem to be pumping litecoin these days.
In any case, it seems Blockstream the company won't be profiting from a rise in bitcoin price, but perhaps their employees will to some degree (though i wonder if even those employees could profit more from offchain consulting than from the amout of bitcoins they have timelocked). So it seems Blockstream has a clear financial interest in getting offchain payment channels going so that they can get their consulting profits. I still haven't seen a clear example of how Roger is going to profit more if BU gets activated vs Segwit activating.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:46:36


Not really, users retain the same power they had. The change is more from Core Developers make the decision and then users have the option to veto be not running their software, to miners decide and then users have the option to veto with something like the user activated soft fork. In both situations users basically have veto power.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:03:03
Yes, segwit aimed for 95%, yet is not even close to 50%, infact I believe BU has more support. I do appreciate you implying that I'm a troll. If you measure bitcoin node count as an accurate proxy for the market, which is a bad idea for many reasons, yes core still has significant support, but even by that metric they are losing ground.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:38:05
That's cute. I realize the effect is not 1:1, i was simply making an obvious example of the total fees increasing despite the average fee going down. Do you have any indication that any increase in fees by limiting transaction capacity is not tempered by damaging the price of bitcoin? Even with transaction fees as high as they are now, the block reward still makes up a much larger proportion of a miner's paycheck than transaction fees do.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:28:04


Actually no, because withholding a block for x seconds has a higher risk of leading to an orphaned block for the attacker, than delaying your target for x seconds while they process your block that has already propogated and continues to propogate to other parts of the network while they work on it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:41:07
Bitcoin Core has like 100 active contributers and BU has like...7? Saying that the fact that BU exists means development is decentralized is like saying that even if one guy owns 93% of the hash power and everyone else has 7%, the fact that that 7% exists means mining is decentralized.


No, but it's about creating the conditions and incentives where alternative ideas can be explored without toxic behavior and labels of altcoin from the main development team. This subbreddit's censorship over the past years has contributed to maintaining this centralization.
As to your reluctance about EC, someone has already said it better than me:
"1) Core wants to take away the miners' role as stewards of the network and take it for themselves.
"Don't trust those weaselly miners," they say, adjusting the Bitcoin Wizards™ logo on their lab coats, "Trust us."
They fail to understand that the incentives in Bitcoin are set up such that miners' profits are inextricably bound to how well they please the rest of the stakeholders. On controversial matters, this binding manifests through a variety of mechanisms:
self-policing: prudent miners refuse to build on rogue miners' blocks (say excessively large blocks), knowing that if they don't orphan them they stand to lose a lot of money by the secondary mechanisms below
ignoral by nodes: if ever an excessively large or abusive block were to make it past self-policing, economically important business nodes - such as those run by exchanges, black markets, Coinbase, banks, governments, etc. - will anyway be running blocksize settings that ignore such excessive blocks (possible now with BU and Classic), causing effective orphaning or loss of value in the rogue chain ("where do I sell my coins if my usual exchange's node won't recognize my chain?")
simple sell-off: should the above mechanisms somehow be slipped past, investors can sell BTC if they don't like miner actions, cutting into all miners' bottom line
fork arbitrage: more pointedly, the ecosystem can fork if there is controversy about the path forward miners have chosen, and investors can sell their BTC in the "rogue" miner side of a fork to buy more BTC in the "prudent" miner side, allowing for an unambiguous market signal and direct removal of rogue miners' profitability, sloshing it over to the prudent miners
firing the miners: as a last resort, the rest of the ecosystem can fork to change the PoW algorithm, completely wiping out the miners
In reality, it would probably never go past self-policing as long as there is good market communication, because miners are obsessive about their bottom line. They aren't in this business to lose money, and stepping on stakeholders' toes is an immediate way to lose money. The Keynesian beauty contest dynamic inherent in miner self-policing prevents any supposed "tragedy of the commons." Rogue miners are better termed dumb miners, or soon-to-be-bankrupt miners, as actions not in line with the ecosystem are rat poison to the rest of the miners, the nodes, and the investors.
2) Core has built up a bullshit narrative, internalized even by most big blockers, that miners are too powerful, that they are dangerous and need to be reined in, due to all sorts of supposed attacks they could run if the wise devs didn't dictate the blocksize cap from on high.
As should be clear from above, miners have no power to do anything the ecosystem doesn't like, other than the 51% attack (which if you're worried about then Bitcoin is probably not your cup of tea).
It is true that if there were "no blocksize cap" ---&gt; in the meaning all miners and other nodes were FORCED to accept every size of block, that would allow the first two mechanisms to be circumvented, which would present a theoretical problem. But that is not being proposed, and no implementation has such a feature. BU and Classic allow nodes to "set their own caps," which works out to mean that under BU/Classic there will be just as much of a blocksize cap as there is now. It just won't be set by Core dev. It will be set by the incentive mechanisms explained above, manifesting as convergence on a suitable Schelling point through many possible means of coordination.
In fact, it already is.
There just happens to be a strong Schelling point around 1MB right now, mainly due to Core dev's historical inertia and general wait-and-see conservatism among miners and the rest of the ecosystem. As fees rise, that Schelling point will give way like a dam burst, moving to something new - whether it is Core-prescribed or not. BU and Classic don't change this dynamic, and they don't invent a new dynamic or "vulnerabilities" like people such as and think.
BU and Classic merely reveal the situation for what it always was: miners could always mod their code or switch implementations, nodes could always apply a patch, there was nothing other than a very thin wall of trivial inconvenience preventing any one miner/node from changing their blocksize settings any way they liked. The only catch is the collective action in the process of coordinating of a new Schelling point. Many people would like to have Core's approval on a new Schelling point to follow, if possible, but that consideration eventually fades as fee pressure mounts, major companies give up on Bitcoin, black markets start to experiment with altcoins, etc.
If Core doesn't want to come along, it can be left in the dustbin of history. Or it can follow and continue pretending to be control, "playing miner," by moving up the blocksize cap to maintain the impression that they are the ones who set it.
Bitcoin perhaps of necessity started out with Satoshi having what appeared to be autocratic control over it, then Gavin was the autocrat, and now Core are the oligarchs. But in fact this was probably never really true, and Bitcoin could not grow up without outgrowing this arrangement even if it ever existed. Without controversy we never had a chance to find out. Now, with controversy mounting, this matter comes to the fore and we see that Core developers are merely Core suggesters, and in a controversy their clinging to tiny blocksize limits is overstepping their position, attempting to dictate something they have neither the demonstrated economic expertise to get right nor the incentive to get right.
BU and Classic see the futility of trying to dictate to the ecosystem, the futility of trying to play miner, the futility of paternalism and "protecting Bitcoin from grievous attacks" via the weak reed of paper-thin convenience barriers.
It's time to get devs out of the mining business. It's time to unbundle the consensus settings from the dev teams and decentralize development. In short, it's time for Bitcoin to grow up."

Lol, just because the nodes didn't crash doesnt prove they were running core. I was talking with someone who's node didn't crash until a few hours after most of the BU nodes went down. So if you looked at the data while he was still running you'd assume he was running Core, but he wasn't.

So if Jihan and Roger and r/btc suddenly decided that segwit was the way forward, you don't think the price would go up even 12%? Is that because you think the market is stupid and inefficient, or is it because you don't think Segwit actually has much value to the network? The price has dropped like 12% in the past day or two on no obvious news, it's not like such price swings are rare. If you believe in efficient markets and that Segwit is valuable to the network I would think a 12% bump is fairly conservative.

So to prevent this theoretical chain split, most core supporters seem to support a user activated soft fork, which virtually guarantees a chain split. How's that for logic?

Lol, don't be dense, it's a constant in Core, it's effectively a variable in BU.
Miners could fork the chain today without consensus. Why would they need BU for that? BU obviously encourages a consensus on blocksize to be reached, through its EB and AD (acceptance depth, which specifies at what point you will compromise on your prefered value, which aids in reaching consensus) settings, it's simply not the form of consensus you're used to and seem to prefer, which involves dev consensus on the specific value to be proposed, followed by approval or rejection by the rest of the network. 
Edit: It's interesting that Bitcoin Core is effectively dev centralization, where if a dev veers too far from the party line he is ostracized from the group, and it's difficult for smaller groups to compete with the larger dev cabal because the larger group has much more manpower. You could argue that each dev is technically independent, but there is strong incentives to stay in the cabal. A  miner cabal can work the same way, with independent actors working with the cabal to press an advantage, and fearing retaliation if they dont toe the line.

It's somewhat of a capacity increase now, but it actually limits capacity in the future. Segwit can allow about 2mb of actual transactions, but provides spammers a maximum of 4mb of space that they could utilize by contriving their transactions in a certain way. Any future scaling would have to be reduced in order to account for that space that is available for an attack.
Just because they think another solution is better for bitcoin in the long run, and are supporting that solution, doesn't make them toxic.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:53:15
You can say the same thing about miners. Miners have no power, only users have power. Users can simply do a user activated soft fork and take away all miner revenue.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:39:52


So it is simply impossible to limit blocks while still participating in emergent consensus. If you set your AD to infinity, then you don't really have an emergent consensus, but just hard block limit. And if your AD is less than infinity than you accept unlimited blocks.
By default, BU ships with AD=12. This makes EB parameter irrelevant. People can set it to 500KB, 1MB, 8MB, 100MB -- it won't matter what they set it to, in the end miners decide.
Do you expect the majority of people to set AD to infinity?
This is a pretty poor assessment. You act like your AD and EB settings are set in stone once you pick them. In reality they will get changed over time. The majority does not have to set EB to infinity immediately to prevent the blocksize from raising indefinitely. The majority just has to have an EB smaller than the current block a miner is wanting to produce to discourage a miner from making the larger block. AD of 12 is sufficient to provide incentive to an average miner making too big blocks. That AD can get increased if the majority feels blocks are getting too big. If it becomes clear that a large portion of miners are very intent on exceeding the EB of most users, then at some point the users would have to set AD near infinity as the miners producing EB approach 51%. You assume an 'attack' by majority of miners against majority of users immediately, which is extremely unlikely. And if miners have 51% they could do the same thing in bitcoin core. What stops them in both the BU and Core example is losing the marketshare of those users if they exceed a level acceptable to them.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:03:28
But if you can trust the economic majority to activate forks, why can't you trust them to decide the order of transactions?
What prevents a "User activated HARD fork" in which the economic majority ignores the miners and reorders the transaction history? It seems the user activated method works equally well for hardforks as it does for softforks. Either way you are incentivising the miners to follow the "users" (economic majority) lead by threatening the value of the coins they are mining.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:21:07
It might appear that way to you, but I believe BU is an attempt to change the software to make consensus on blocksize easier. Id imagine most people supporting the BU changes would love it if Core Devs started contributing to BU. Im sure they'd shun Devs who are openly ideologically opposed to their project, but I don't believe non-ideologues who want to contribute in good faith will be turned away.
Also, apparently the market doesnt want segwit either.

Yes but the proportion is not equal throughout the network. The difference in propagation time in most of the network that has adaquate resources to handle it would be miniscule. The only way you could even remotely recreate the effect is if you knew the exact resources available to every to every other mining node on the network, and then adjusted your withholding time before you broadcast your block to that specific node or something. But even then the first nodes you broadcast would be rebroadcasting to other nodes, potentially before it was wanted. Itd be convenient for your argument if it was exactly the same scenario, but it's simply not.

You really think miners believe if bitcoin died, that an altcoin would instantly pop up to replace 100% of the marketshare of bitcoin? You really think they're that dumb? It seems a lot more likely to me that if bitcoin died, blockchain token values across the board would suffer for a *long* time.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:16:06
One of the reasons I don't like Segwit is that it increases the space available for actual transactions by 100%, but in doing so it increases the space available to spammers, who specifically craft their transactions to use as much space as possible, by 400%. The fact that Segwit increases the max size of such an "attack block" has to be taken into account for future scaling proposals, limiting the networks ability for onchain scaling in the future. You might not think thats a "legitimate reason" but a lot of other people do.

So the network is not secure today? Bitcoin seems to be working fairly well for me. How exactly am I at risk today because of this lack of security?
Edit: are you saying that to be secure everyone has to use a full node, and since most people don't use full nodes Bitcoin is not secure? If that's your agrument, I'd say that even if blocksize was 10KB, most users still wouldn't use a full node. Not because the resource equirements are too high, simply because they can't be bothered and convenient non-full node options meet their needs.

It might not be clear that mining directly impacts price, but we're talking about miners being exposed to and affected by the price of bitcoin. Whether mining has an effect on price or not doesn't change the fact that miners do infact have an interest in the Bitcoin price going up.
Even so there's evidence that heavy mining investment does infact impact price. If someone makes a large mining investment and difficulty raises, the next person may see the large difficult increase and decide instead of mining themselves, they will simply buy bitcoin directly. Also, as difficulty rises, many miners are reluctant to sell their bitcoins below their price of production. So current mining breakeven point sets a floor for the price of bitcoin which provides some resistance to price drops. Also, increased mining power increases the security of the network and likely affects price indirectly as well.


If the miners all quit then the network would be more vulnerable to an attack because there's less security. It's crazy that there is a class of bitcoiners around today that seem to hate miners. If you don't like miners, why are you using bitcoin? It was designed on the premise of using that rational self interest of miners to secure the coin. It's not some side effect, it's a central aspect of Satoshi's design.

Maybe if that person tried to increase inflation they'd be worried that users will switch to another software version. In any case, BU doesn't seem to be the ones saying that you're stuck with us forever, for better or for worse. It's Bitcoin Core that I get that feeling from. If BU suddenly gains majority market share, I'm sure theyd realize they could lose it just as fast.

I'm well aware that BU devs screwed up and will willingly admit that. Will you admit that Peter also screwed up? I'm not sure where Greg is getting his numbers, probably from a screenshot I saw of a BU dev mentioning offhand that the attack started 30 minutes after the dev branch update, which doesn't appear to have been meant as an official record of time. What time exactly was the dev branch update? If you look at the real data we have a tweet at 10:26 and most node's dropping off the network after 10:45, with some having gone between 10:30 and 10:45. Regardless of if someone had started the attack before his tweet, which I'm not entirely sure of...at best the attack had barely began...did Peter know that it had began?,  it was still irresponsible to publicize the vulnerability for even more potential attackers before a fix had been released.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:48:40
You realize that non mining nodes get to set EB and AD settings in BU just like mining nodes do, right? If miners set a crazy high blocksize, normal nodes will set their acceptance depth to max and then the miners will be left on a chain by themselves with most users and value on another chain, effectively the same result as a user activated soft fork.
Also, I'd argue that bitcoin development is even MORE centralized than mining. You might say, "anyone can write code and contribute to core", but in the same sense, anyone can start mining. There are only 5 people with commit access in the Bitcoin Core Repo. New developers to bitcoin automatically go to bitcoin core to submit their code, because it has orders or magnitude more eyeballs on it than the competition, and they want their ideas to be seen, reviewed, and have a chance of actually making it into the release that gets run by nodes. Competing effectively with bitcoin core at this point is at least as difficult as starting your own asic farm and competing with the miners.
Bitcoin Core effectively has control in the sense that they are the only group with the resources to make a proposal. You're right that they don't have ABSOLUTE control because miners or users can VETO their proposal, but miners and users cannot make their own proposal due to the resources it takes to make software to secure a 12 billion dollar market. The veto has been enacted and that's why we have no segwit. But it's a testament to bitcoin core's control that a viable alternative with  bug free code still does not exist even after years of core's stalling.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:18:15


Lack reading comprehension much? Im clearly talking about alternative clients that modify consensus rules when I say "alternative clients are not allowed and that Bitcoin Core is the only client that is allowed to **modify the consensus rules**" It says alot about the strength of your argument that you ignore the context and attempt to create that strawman argument.


Sure. I think the weakest unaddressed aspect of Bitcoin is the tendency toward Dev Centralization. Satoshi, being a dev himself, didnt think much about dev centralization. In the beginning, the code was 100% centralized and dominated by him alone. But when you're the one at the center you dont often think that that form of centralization is an urgent problem.


Not necessarily. The majority has a strong incentive to coalesce around the best option. Those people presenting the options are not your enemy. Options are good. The only threat is if someone forces a split with a near 50-50 split. If the alt consensus client does not intend to cause a split until there is a clear majority, I don't see the potential for menace. By defintion, if the majority of miners and users choose to change, they believe the benefits outweigh the risks, otherwise they wouldnt do it. 


I can say the same thing about mining. Mining is an open game, anyone can mine. The truth is that obviously some miners have more power than other, just as some Devs have more power than others. Only ...5? people have commit access to Bitcoin Core. Dont they have more power, especially the lead maintainer, than a random new contributer? A technocracy can be just as centralized and cliqueish as any other kind of bureaucracy. Supposedly the smartest people are the ones at the center (with the most influence/power), which makes many people think its great, but more often a technocracy only requires some minimum level of technological knowledge, and the ones that end up at the center, with the most influence, the most aggressive of that bunch.


Sure, and its not going anywhere until Core gets someone to iron the bugs out of it. I saw Luke-Jr *reluctantly* suggest he might work on it, all while claiming hes totally not *endorsing* it. I wonder if he'd do the same thing for BU /s.


It would only put you on a minority fork if you're in the **minority**.   Even with BU, miners cannot push a blocksize bigger than the majority of users will accept, unless the miners want to fork themselves off the network, which would put them in the same position as the UASF does.


Isnt 'meant to be' by who? Satoshi? Satoshi left and his opinion doesnt mean much these days. The interaction between miners creating coins and users giving value to those coins is what matters. The majority of Users decide what bitcoin is. In a financial system like bitcoin, the financial majority is ultimately always going to have the power. I dont know if you want to call that 'direct democracy' but it doesnt matter what you want to call it.


And one of the rules is that a hardfork can be used to change the rules...go figure.


Your point would be relevant if this was only a 'security matter'. The blocksize debate is more importantly an economic matter. The users and miners are the people being affected by this economic matter, why should it be dictated by software developers, who, as a whole, are not economic experts. The arguments against bigger blocksize stem down to economic judgements that too many nodes will be priced out of the market if blocks get beyond x size. Technical arguments can be used to support that economic judgement, but it is an economic judgement at its core.


Didnt Luke- JR lose coins in Mt Gox too? Why bring up irrelevant personal attacks to distract from the issue?

This is pretty toxic attitude to have when both camps could be collaborating to provide quality code in several options so that the network can decide for itself.

Main problem with PoS seems to be that there's incentive to extend both conflicting chains because it doesn't cost anything to extend the chain and you get the reward on both chains ("nothing at stake" problem). If you go deeper though, if it's possible to sell off your holdings on the chain that you think will ultimately lose, you're effectively solving the nothing at stake problem in a messy way in the exchange rate between the two coins. The UASF seems to solve the conflict in the same way, ultimately by decreasing the value of the token on the chain you're competing with.

Obviously Core cannot change consensus rules by itself, the change has to be approved by miners and users. But the change must originate with a core developer, unless the community abandons core, but even  then it must still originate with some other developer. Please tell me how a miner is supposed to approve a consensus change that no one has actually provided code for. How is a user supposed to run code that doesn't exist? Devs have to come to consensus as to what software will be made available to miners and users and will be merged into production code. A single dev is not viable for a project like bitcoin, so a dev group must collaborate to pick a specific number for the blocksize, or make it user selectable. Then a second layer of consensus must be reached by users, who only have 2 options...run the code, or don't run it. Users cannot just magically hire and then dictate to a developer team to create code that is acceptable to a majority of users, because without some kind of consensus building mechanism such a BU, it's too hard to guess exactly the correct value for the variable and then express that value in a unanimous voice. The alternative is to hope that a core dev with commit access merges code which happens to contain the perfect value which will satisfy the market. Obviously that's not working very well. Until devs come to consensus on the correct value, or provide software that makes the variable user selectable, miners and users can only wait and reject the current incorrect dev consensus, which is segwit.

I have a hard time believing that any rational person thinks stagnating development would be good for the price of bitcoin.

Sure, but the transactions cost essentially nothing for the miner to include in the block, so there's no reason a miner would prefer 1000 transactions with a $1 fee, vs 2000 transactions with a 50c fee. The average fee is reduced with larger blocks, but the total fees are not necessarily reduced since you have more transactions. When you factor in the idea that the network is more valuable with more transaction space, which affects the price of a bitcoin and hence the value of the block reward...I'm not so sure the reason miners dont want segwit is that it would temporarily reduce fees.

Sure, but what about a sustaned attack that can be carried out indefinately? How exactly is this kind of sustained attack costly for a miner cabal who is mining the attack block to hinder the minority miners? In theory it would actually be profitable.
 Compact blocks is an option a miner can use to decrease the bandwidth needed to propagate the block or for nodes to relay transactions, obviously a well connected miner that is trying to MAXIMIZE the bandwidth needed for peers outside the cabal to recieve his blocks is simply not going to use compact blocks. 
You can try to claim that the benefits of segwit are worth the risks, but you can't claim there aren't any risks or any reasons someone might oppose Segwit, and expect to be taken serously.

If there's no such thing as Dev Consensus, then how does Core decide what code to merge?
How do I know that the Bitcoin network as a whole has more at stake economically than ~100 people that contribute to bitcoin core? Well miners have about $2m a day at risk, and there are over 200k subscribers to r/bitcoin, so let's be conservative and say there's 200k bitcoin users. I find it a reasonable assumption that 200,000 users + miners with $2,000,000 per day at risk have more at stake than 100 software developers. I'm sure you have more at stake than most devs from your gambling sites, so perhaps your perspective is a bit skewed? Even if those 100 devs had 20,000 bitcoins each, that'd only be 2m coins...users and miners would have the other 14m coins, or 88% of the total. 
Bitcoin Core is default in the sense that it was already installed on most node's systems before this debate even became a thing. It's disengenous to state that Core has some kind of mandate and will of the people just because most people haven't been pissed off quite enough to bother to switch their software.

Yes I'm refering to dev consensus as the process which determines what actually gets merged into bitcoin core, the project leader is supposedly the judge of that consensus. Cores choosing Segwit as their answer to the blocksize debate has been proven to be incorrect in the sense that there is no sign that the network will ever actually accept it. Their job in this situation is to write code that the network wants to run. The entire process of Bitcoin Core dictating the size of blocks, backed by their near monopoly on dev talent, has proven to be a terrible mechanism (they seem to spend more time harping on their supperior depth of coding talent than the underlying value of the concepts they are providing code to carry out...). BU looks like a much more efficient way to determine the correct value the market wants.

It only takes about a 12% drop in the price of bitcoin to completely negate any transaction fees that a miner takes in. Dont you think that destroying 2nd layer solutions might affect the price of bitcoin negatively by 12%? Hell we've had a 12% drop in the past day or two. Do you really think miners are working against bitcoin's best interests for some extra transaction fees? Do you really think they're that dumb? Miners have a huge incentive to do what's best for bitcoin. That leads me to believe they legitimately don't think activating Segwit is the best option for the network. However, it seems that the only way that Blockstream can start making any money is if they force us into 2nd layer solutions as fast as possible, even if it's premature. Is Blockstream actively plotting against the network? Probably not, but miners have much more economic incentive to support the price of bitcoin than blockstream, so I'd give miners more weight in that decision.

It's not that no one would notice the spam, it's the fact that the miner could claim that he was simply not actively censoring or monitoring transactions during that time, and he doesn't know who the person sending the spam transactions is.

Even if most of the VC companies are less associated with banking interests than AXA, that wouldnt change the veracity of my original statement that blockstream has a conflict of interest in the onchain vs offchain scaling debate because their profit potential is in offchain solutions, and have less financial interest in an appreciating bitcoin than Roger Ver does, making their influence more questionable than Roger's, so this discussion is not very interesting.
Edit: To be clear, I don't think blockstream is actively working with banks to cripple bitcoin, but I do think that due to their financial interest in offchain solutions, it is very convenient for them to trivialize bitcoin's longterm onchain potential, and use their influence to direct focus on offchain solutions instead. Its very difficult to convince someone of viability of something when their paycheck depends on the alternative.

A cartel of miners can start pumping out bigger blocks today, without BU. All BU does is make it easier for nodes to signal what size block they'd be willing to accept.
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:10:48


None of the other options have an opinion on the blocksize, defering to Bitcoin Core, which is pushing segwit as our only option for consensus.


Users can always reject miners with some type of user activated soft fork. BU doesnt prevent that.


Its a useful indication for them to follow but by no means the only signal, especially if theres signs its being gamed. Its not a simple vote, its an emergent process. Miners would weight the signals from exchanges and known nodes higher than unknown ones, which youre right they would likely ignore unless they thought they had economic weight behind them. The settings are most useful on a user's side in order to reject a miner's block thats too big.


Segit is a consensus change. Core definately proposed segwit so yes they do propose consensus changes.


Exactly, if you dont want to follow the majority you can stay on a minority fork. Whether that fork would be functional or if the tokens would have any significant value is questionable, but yes if you don't hold any bitcoins or if the value of them doesnt matter to you feel free to ignore the majority. But if you have significant valued stored in bitcoin, then the majority does mean a bit more than 'jack shit'.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:27:52


Just because there isnt a limit hard coded by the dev team doesnt mean the miners wont impose a limit.


So I've heard from the small blockers that miners like BU better than segwit because segwit adds more transactions and miners are going to use BU to keep the blocksize lower than segwit would allow in order to increase their fees. Now I hear that the miners want to use BU to make the blocksize large enough that fees are 0 forever so we're somehow forced to alter the inflation schedule. You cant have it both ways, which doomsday narrative do you prefer? They are mutually exclusive. 
Maybe...just maybe...the miners will do something in the middle thats entirely reasonable. They were already enforcing a softcap for years well before we hit the hardcap.

So here's an example of a guy who found a bug in live Core code in 2015 and wanted a bounty for it. It looks like he ended up getting paid. Should he have just sold the exploit to the highest blackhat bidder instead, or tried to create maximum damage with the exploit in order to teach Core a 'lesson'? But I thought only BU has bugs, never Core, right?....
The toxicity that this debate has brought out in people is rediculous. The community is in a sad state.

I did some back of the envelope calculations a while back, and assuming 10% growth in bandwidth per year, which is a fairly low estimate, we could have VISA level throughput onchain (2000 transactions a second...up from 3 transactions per second) in 30-50 years. I wish more people would look at the long term potential for onchain scaling and not just dismiss it totally as irrelevant like many people seem to do.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:06:28
If the current method of consensus was easy, effective, and satisfactory to all, why the hell do you think we've been having this debate for years now? Its because Dev consensus on blocksize does not accurately reflect user's wishes. Bitcoin Unlimited allows the debate to shift from words to action, with signaling methods that make it easy for users and miners to converge on a common blocksize. Why should Devs be the gatekeepers for an economic variable of the system, when they have almost nothing at stake economically when compared to users and miners?
I see segwit supporters throwing around the idea that lots of nodes and businesses have said that they're segwit ready. I'm not so sure that everyone who says they're *ready* for segwit actually *wants* segwit. Just because an exchange says they're ready for it if it happens, doesnt necessarily mean they think its the best option. I think you may be overestimating segwit's support among economic actors. Doubly so with node count, when you consider that the default node for people who are not active in this debate is bitcoin core. That'd be like if in the presidential election, non-voters automatically went to the incumbent party.

What's bullshit is you trying to pretend that AXA Strategic Ventures is unrelated to AXA Bank Europe. THEY ARE BOTH PART OF AXA GROUP.  They're separated by corporate shells for tax, liability, and organizational purposes but have the same people pulling the strings in the end and share holders have interest in all the underlying divisions.
From wikipedia: 


 If they're unrelated but just have the same name, then why does it say on AXA Strategic Ventures about us page  that:


 






Or try 


Take a look at the biographies and you can see that the same people are interwoven into the companies under the AXA Group umbrella.
Why would AXA Strategic Ventures have "preferred access" to AXA Group resources if they were unrelated? Hint: They are part of the same organization.
Your denial of this fact just leads to more focus on how much shared interest the AXA Group companies have so you're not doing yourself any favors with this trope.

I don't think you understand. If a small group of dedicated people made a bunch of sock puppets, they could inflate support for pull requests for something like a blocksize increase which is technically valid but otherwise controversial (BIP 101 for example). If you have 50 active "peers" reviewing the software and trying to come to consensus, a cabal of 10 devs could make 10 sock puppets each, and turn a 25:25 split for NACK:ACK into 125:25 split. Then the lead maintainer can use the fake support to justify not merging the pull request, if that was his goal.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:23:56
You know it's not as simple as that. What do you say to people that don't like segwit because it only increases the size of usable transaction space by 100%, but increases the maximum size available to attackers by 400%? Effectively you've reduced the future scalability by a factor of two because you now have to take into account this extra space that's available to attackers.

Sure its easy to trivially download another client, but its not trivially easy to organize a supermajority of users to all download a new client and start running that client at the same time.

You spend all these words to say that you believe a change to the consensus rules means that the network that has changed is no longer bitcoin. Semantics.

What I don't think you understand, is that the users are too fragmented to hire developers to write code for them and come to consensus on a specific blocksize without some kind of mechanism or leadership.
For a long time that leadership was Satoshi, then it was fragmented somewhat to a few other devs with commit access. How does a user go about getting his blocksize proposal merged into the client that everyone runs? He asks permission from a dev with commit access, or more often an influencial dev writes the proposal himself. Core has chosen to propose Segwit, but obviously the market does not want it. How long do we wait for an alternate proposal from Core? BU is different because it does not dictate the value of the variable, it is only a mechanism that makes it easier for users to arrive at consensus, without that variable first being proposed and merged into working code by a Core Developer.

You act like miners are one monolithic entity. Miners compete with other miners. Miners do not want to have their blocks orphaned by a competitor's chain.


If their revenue depends on not alienating users, or having their blocks rejected by the majority of users, which it does, they could do some real market research perhaps. That's the kind of thing someone that actually has a financial stake in the decision (miners) would do. Bitcoin Core?...not so much.
It's funny that you think that miners would just ignore node's EB AD settings. How profitable will their blocks be when the majority of users aren't accepting their blocks?


Simply untrue. If a user installs BU and sets EB 4 AD 1000 hes signaling that he has a pretty damn hard limit at 4mb. If most users have an EB of 4 or less and an AD that causes a significant orphan cost, the blocksize is infact limited at 4 unless you believe miners are just trying to lose money, and in that case I wonder how you got into bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:02:35
Also, do you realize that it would only take a 12% bump in the price of bitcoin to make up for transaction fees, even if the fees immediately dropped to 0? Do you not believe that enabling segwit and having 2.1mb effective blocksize would result in a 12% increase in value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:17:22
Do proposals 1 and 2 not result in miners being punished by the economic majority if they don't switch? If they dont they're not really relevant to what I'm wanting to discuss. If they do, it seems like effectively implementing proof of stake.
I realize that proposal 3 only applies to Segwit. What I'm asking is if the proof-of-stake like nature of the idea is a good idea for this issue, why isn't it good for other issues as well?
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:31:58
It's more effective to ovewhelm their resources than to withhold the block because if you just withhold the block the competing miners can focus entirely on trying to outbuild your chain rather than working at an inherent disadvantage trying to build on your resource hog chain (edit: it also provides the miners more plausable denial than outright withholding blocks, they can claim that they were just relaying transactions that did not originate with themselves). If 4mb is safe then how are 2mb blocks "orders of magnitude" more risky than segwit? You realize that segwit isnt the only way to fix malleability, right?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:42:35
Yes, if you ignore the miners like this, it seems to me you are effectively using a form of proof of stake. If its a good idea to do this, makes you wonder why not just use proof of stake directly and not waste effort and electricity on the mining game at all.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:02:29
How much control do users have over the block size if Bitcoin Core is the only viable software implementation? It seems like BU doesn't remove any power from users. Core decides the blocksize and then users can veto Core if core really messes up, assuming there are other options besides core to switch to. With BU miners are the ones instead of Core that makes the initial decision, and BU provides mechanisms for nodes to signal their preferred blocksize, and if miners ignore their preference, users can veto the miners and do something like a user activated soft fork. It seems like BU gives users even more say than Core. With Core they only get veto, with BU they get a defined system to signal their preference, plus veto power they already had.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:37:53

Bitcoin was designed to run on the rational self interest of miners who are creating the coins, and users who are holding the coins longterm.

Perhaps as it gains adoption more people will contribute to it. BU provides a valuable service to bitcoin by allowing the network to vote with their hashpower. There seems to be a toxic idea here that if the community overrules Core Devs on one variable, then all 100 of them will take their toys and go home. Maybe a few of the most egotistical and toxic devs will leave but thatd be ok anyways.

Prove that the economic majority supports segwit over BU. You cant do it. Theres a reason hashpower exists in bitcoin, and that's because it's an objective measure of the network's intent that can't be faked. Nodes can be faked. Economic consensus can't be proven until there's actually a split and we see which side gets to store the value. Both sides claim that they'd have the economic majority. We'll see.

For instance, a technical expert may be able to acurately tell you the minimum system requirements needed to run a full node at a given blocksize. However, said technical expert often then goes on to make vague claims about the system requirements causing a drop in full nodes, or decentralization in general, without quantifying anything about how they know that would happen, or taking into account that a larger blocksize and lower fees could increase adoption of total users and nodes, offsetting any potential loss of nodes because of increased system demands. They are qualified to tell you system requirements given a certain throughput, but they are not any better able to tell you what the effects on bitcoin adoption and centralization would be, given those system requirements, than any other person.
To be clear I'm not saying software experts should be ignored, especially on those specific issues where they do have expertise. What I have a problem with is people saying that ONLY software developers and technical experts opinions have any value in the blocksize debate, when a lot of the debate is not even a technical matter, but an economic and political matter.
EDIT: The decentralization issue is one of the best examples of this issue. At its core, the question of what level of decentralization will occur at a given blocksize is an economic issue of determining at what point the cost of a full node is not worthwhile for a person, which determines the percentage of users which will run a full node. But there is also the economic issue of determining how blocksize and fees affects the absolute size of the userbase, which affects node count not on a percentage basis, but by affecting the number to which that percentage is applied. The only technical aspect involved in the decentralization question is determining the system requirements for nodes at each potential blocksize. Every other step, such as calculating the cost of those requirements for the average node, how those costs will change in the future, how those costs affect the percent of users who run a node, how those costs affect the total user base....these are all economic questions. It's the same when you look at miner decentralization. Determining system requirements and orphan risk is a technical issue, but every step after that is an economic determination of what those system requirements and orphan risks actually costs them, how those costs will affect who mines, how those costs will affect where they mine, how those costs will affect future mining hardware production, ect. 
Considering this, I feel like many people give much too much weight to many Core Developers' thoughts on decentralization. Their expertise is limited to determining system requirements of a given blocksize, and when they go beyond that and start telling people how those requirements will affect decentralization they are going outside of their area of expertise and are no longer speaking as an expert.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:37:50
Just because worldwide transaction volume also increases, doesn't mean that increasing the blocksize to keep up with increased available resources is not useful. Are you saying that in 30 years we might has well have 3 tps onchain capacity as 2000 tps?

It's pretty stupid to imply that it's ok to draw attention to unfixed bugs, simply because the bugs shouldn't be there in there in the first place. Here's an example from 2015, in which a hacker was apparently paid a bounty for a bug he found in live Core code. Would it have been morally ok for him to just sell it to an attacker because it was Core's fault for having the bug anyways? 
You're using arguments against BU that the legacy financial institution has used used against Bitcoin from the beginning. "Don't trust Bitcoin, they only have a few people writing vulnerable software code, and we've been protecting your money for hundreds of years in our battle tested banking system!"
I'd love it if Core and BU Devs could spend less time slinging mud at eachother, and more time collaborating to give the network good options to choose from. Let the market decide what code gets run. If the market turns further toward BU, less ideological developers will start participating and the code will get more and more peer review. 
Of course you'll have a few bad actors like Peter who choose to gloat at others mistakes and seeks to undermine for ego's sake, but most Core Devs and contributers are more reasonable.

Which statement have we determined was false? When you said "there are no banks" is demonstrably false, but the truth of my statement that the investors are "largely banks" depends on the level of investment of each participant, which we don't know because blockstream won't provide that info...they won't even provide us with the sales pitch they used to convince their investors that they were going to make a profit. What we do know is that AXA was a major investor and that despite your protests that they aren't a "bank", they do infact participate in and have a interest in banking and the legacy financial system in general.
Would it make your PR effort feel better if instead of "largely banks" I said "includes legacy financial system interests"?

From what I read, Schnorr Sigs would increase transaction capacity by 40%. In 7 years when bandwith capacity has increased 100%, why not increase the blocksize to 4mb to match bandwidth availability? Then with Schnorr 40% bonus, we have an effective throughput of 5.6MB.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:50:10

At the end what matters is the total percentages. Core's marketshare has been dropping by every metric available. Even if you say Core has 95% of the nodes, their marketshare has been dropping constantly for a long time now. But the node count is really an academic thing anyways, too easy to game.

The safest thing to do is stifle growth by refusing to even attempt to match blocksize growth rate to network resource growth rate? Maybe thats safest for the banks and financial processors that would otherwise have a much harder time competing with Bitcoin. You have to make educated "guesses" to progress. We're using an encryption scheme in Bitcoin that we're guessing won't be broken anytime soon. No one can guarantee that it won't be broken in a few months, but guess what we use it anyways because we have a pretty good idea it'll be safe and if it turns out its not we can change it in the future.

It seems to me that if the economic majority can override the miners at any time, it makes sense to work on a system that gives power to the economic majority directly rather than though a miner intermediary.

@_date: 2017-03-27 03:12:53
Theoretically it's possible for BU to lead to a smaller blocksize if the majority sets their "excessive blocksize" setting to 500kb or something. Some people think that the miners secretly like BU because they want to use it to limit the blocksize below the 2mb segwit would provide, because the smaller blocks would result in higher fees. I think that's a stupid theory because a miner's income is only 12% fees, 88% block reward. Theres too much risk of damaging the value of your block reward with a lower bitcoin price. Bitcoin price drops about 12% and you've negated all your fee income. Bu miners simply think it's not in the best interest of bitcoin to stall onchain scaling in order to incentivize 2nd layers. The goal is to maximize fees paid by users, which goes toward the chain security by being invested in mining, WITHOUT driving away users or slowing adoption. Miners are in the best position to balance these two factors because they are affected by both the fee and the  Bitcoin token price, which can be seen as a proxy for the health and utility of the network. Bitcoin Core devs do not have enough at stake with these economic factors in order to make the best decision.

Not sure, from what I was reading, looks like BU devs have reported bugs directly to Core in the past without gloating about it on twitter.

It seems to me that if you send too large blocks to your competition, that also increases your orphan risk. Either way it costs him money if he doesn't have a clear majority. Whether your competition isn't building on your blocks because you never sent them the block, or because it took them too long to recieve it and process it before they found their own, doesn't seem to make a difference in the end.

You only compare it to things you think it compares favorably toward. Instead of signature discount that doesn't have much effect on the problem and who's implementation leads to 4mb max blocksize but only 2mb useful size, why not just charge directly for added outputs? Instead of comparing segwits quadratic hashing to a straight blocksize increase, why not compare it to a blocksize increase + flexible transactions or something? You present a false dichotomy. It kind of ruins the idea that you can only block segwit on ideological grounds when there are other valid options, doesn't it? Are segwit supporters blocking BU simply on ideological grounds? BU is closer to activating than segtwit, so if anyone's blocking something, it's the segwit side...

Round and round in circles we go, again with you claiming that AXA is not a bank. You would be right if you said that they are not *only* a bank, since by nature of being the "second most powerful transnational corporation in terms of ownership and thus corporate control over global financial stability", they are also an insurance company and investing firm, among other things. It's clear you wish to deny AXA's banking interests because it's bad for PR but it's also very clear that you're wrong. It would be much simpler for you to just admit that they do infact have legacy banking and financial system interests, but demonstrate that they are not influencing Blockstream's goals for bitcoin.

What do you mean, "can't even get the latest version of the software?" The latest version of the software is always in the public repo. People can work on bigfixes to 0 day exploits in a clone of that repo, but they're not the latest version until they've been made public, which they always are. How else do you expect to fix an existing exploit in the code? Yea it sucks that they had existing exploits at all, but that's a symptom of the develeper centralization that Bitcoin Core has created and will take time to fix.
What is Jihan's "trap" exactly? Jihan is a miner, and bitcoin was designed to align miner's interests with the network's interests because miners are paid with bitcoin. The only logical choice of Jihan is to do what he thinks will ultimately lead to a higher price of bitcoin and the most bitcoin users sending transactions for him to mine.

EDIT: Greg makes it seem like the BU team was attempting to weaponize Core's bugs in order to actually cause damage, when infact they were only attempting to "weaponize" in the sense that they were trying to see if it was harmful before releasing the information publicly, because they didn't want to release harmful information, unlike Peter Todd.

Thats good, because miners acting in their own self interest is at the heart of bitcoin's function. I believe that artificially capping the blocksize to increase fees above a few cents each prevents the price of a bitcoin from reaching its full potential, so I don't believe miners would do that for those reasons. Sure they'd get more fee's but their block reward would be worth less, more than countering the increase in fees.

Less dangerous to future scaling, because they can be more easily pruned, but for as long as the attack actually lasts, they take up just as much bandwidth as the rest of the data while the blocks are being propogated, so for the purposes of a spam attack by miners seeking to overwhelm the bandwidth of less connected competitors, IT IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

Someone can have a wallet , and they will think money hasn't arrived because you sent them money from a wallet with a different EB or AD setting.
The miners have every incentive to have the process arrive at stasis and be stable the vast majority of time. Maybe the scenario you described happens once every two years or so.

Major exchanges are not going to pick a side in a contentious split. They have the least risk and most to gain by allowing trading of both types of coins. Then whichever side wins is the side that has the most money to buy coins they support, and the most coins available to dump on the other side and crash the price. So yes a UASF comes down to who has the biggest wallet.
If the people who don't follow the UASF have enough money to support the price of the non UASF coins, miners will have no incentive to switch.

Miner cannot 'control' anything against the will of the users, even with BU. Users could just stop running BU, especially if alternative clients are encouraged. What we have right now though is Bitcoin Core developers asserting that alternative clients are not allowed and that Bitcoin Core is the only client that is allowed to modify the consensus rules. If you believe that, then you accept that a group of software developers has all the control. It's strange to me that so many people fear miner centralization, but are ok with developer centralization, where the Bitcoin Core devs seek to delegitimize any competition and seek to label them altcoins. For a 'trustless' system, the current arrangement sure puts alot of trust in one dev team.
The slippery slope analogy you use is a poor argument. By your logic, we should forever pretend that bitcoin can never be upgraded. Theoretically, the coin limit could be increased through some kind of convoluted soft fork just as segwit changed the block size with a softfork. People used to think it would require a hard fork to increase the blocksize, but then a way was devised to do it with a soft fork. Segwit is on the same slope is BU. Ultimately, you have to trust that a majority of users will not support changes (hardfork or soft) that would be harmful to bitcoin in the long term.
I believe the current system operates like this: Bitcoin Core takes a near infinite amount of choices and narrows them down to one option. Miners and users then get to vote to accept or reject. Why should the Devs be the only ones that get any choice in the matter, and miners and users are simply left with veto power. If the Core Dev team refuses to code a good option, we can never move forward. BU simply gives miners and users a more direct way to come to consensus on the ideal block size, instead of the decision being funneled though a central dev team, who have very little at stake when it comes to the blocksize. Users and miners are the ones that are affected by the blocksize, why should they not be the ones to decide? 
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:43:43
Whether softfork or hardfork, they both depend on miners to activate it, no? The only difference seems to be that with a softfork, nonupgrading nodes are swept along with the change rather than being given the option of upgrading or staying on the old chain. Core prefers this option because in a hardfork everyone has to explicitly accept the change they have presented and they perceive that as a threat.
Edit: To those who think miners have too much power...nodes actually have more power in a hardfork scenario than soft fork. The softfork is designed specifically to impose the change even if there is a substantial amount of dissenting or nonupgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:12:51


So Core is the only option according to you. Seems pretty centralized to me.


In the same sense, miners cannot control consensus, because otherwise theyd just be rejected by users. Just like if core tried to override consensus theyd be rejected by users. But core definately has a strong impact on consensus. So far they have presented us with segwit as our only option, but they seem to have been vetoed on that. They have a strong control by controling what options users have. Until development decentralizes and we have multiple large competing dev teams (BU barely counts, they are not a large experienced team) core has alot of control.


Signaling only means nothing if the people looking at signaling dont give a shit about the users signaling. Miners have a strong economic incentive to please users because they depend on the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin Core has no economic incentive to please its users, which is why its stupid to depend on core to determine the economics of the system.


Except Core currently provides the code and is the defacto standard for the rules of the bitcoin network. It sounds like youre saying Core owns bitcoin, if you want to change the rules, the go make an altcoin. I believe most bitcoin users believe Core has not been aggressive enough in raising the blocksize, but so far they have not been able to rally around an alternative. 


Core can propose changes to consensus rules just like miners propose changes. In both cases users are able to accept or reject. Users depend on Core to make such proposals because spontaneosly generating software code out of a large crowd of mostly non-coding users is not possible. An alternative is to allow miners to make the proposal instead, because they have more at stake in the outcome than some volunteer sotware developers.


Just like everyone is free to change the consensus rules of bitcoin if the majority wants to. You might not think thats technically bitcoin anymore, but the majority doesnt care about your labels.

Lol...dude. you're really going off on a tangent here. I don't want users to be forced to do anything. I don't know how I'd go about that if I wanted to. I'm just telling you BU is a valid option. You say BU takes power away from users and gives it to miners, but the truth is it takes power away from Bitcoin Core and gives it to miners. The users have just as much power with BU, perhaps more since they can actually signal their preference blocksize directly, whereas core has no real procedure for finding out what users actually want. If you have a majority revolt against 'consensus' then you didn't have consensus in the first place. If you don't get a majority to agree with said 'revolt' then nothing happens anyways.

I'm not so sure about that. Segwit increases the "effective blocksize" in optimistic real world use, assuming full adoption, to 2.1mb per block, while increasing the amount of data spammers could stuff in the blocks to 4mb. So you increase your throughput by 100% while increasing the amount of data space available to spam you with by alot more, potentially 300%. Don't act like Seqwit is all roses with no trade offs. In contrast to what you say about Segwit paving the way for increases in the future, its pretty clear that hardcore small blockers will use this increased spam attack vector to argue AGAINST blocksize increases in the future.

The blocksize limit has had a very small effect on the blockchain size as of yet. For most of bitcoin's history we were well below the limit, and the limit doesn't actually have any affect on blockchain size until you butt up against it.
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:45:09
1 or 2 mb increase isn't the longterm solution. Longterm solution is increasing blocksize at the rate of the increase in average bandwidth speed. Over the long term that produces quite a bit of scaling.

The difference between moderation and censorship is a matter of perspective and depends on what your definition of bitcoin is and in this case whether you think bitcoin can hardfork and still be bitcoin. Theres no black and white here. 
Honest question while I have your attention: If there was such an overwhelming desire in the r/bitcoin population to not see anymore threads about the blocksize debate from those people who later become r/btc, why didnt the community just downvote them? Why did those threads keep rising to the front page? Why were mods forced to remove them instead?

A hard fork that increases blocksize isn't affecting "immutability" in any way. That term is generally used to refer to the idea that once a transaction gets into the blockchain it stays there, not that the rules determining what a valid transaction is in the future will stay the same forever.
This idea that people don't want to get into a "habit" of increasing the blocksize is a bit silly, but I'd agree that we don't want to go through this drawn our process every few years, which is why I support a change that would settle the issue for some time to come, like BU, or a set percentage per year that approximates the average global yearly increase in bandwidth speeds.
Edit: Also, I don't think anyone is proposing we make blocks big enough that they'd require $500 per month nodes. I'd be happy with 10% bigger blocks per year, and since bandwidth costs are dropping 10% per year (storage costs dropping even faster), that shouldnt result in any cost increase at all.

"Probably always full"? Blocks didn't get full till 2016. What makes you think that returning to a more reasonable block size relative to the current available technology wouldn't have the same effect? There's not an infinite demand for blockchain spam. Otherwise blocks would have been full in 2014 too.
You could argue that it theoretically impacts decentralization to some degree, but to argue that increased block size wouldn't prevent things like this happening as often just is not supported by the history.

Sometimes it's better to use two separate tools that are designed to work optimally for that specific task, rather than use 1 tool which will work ok for both, but not be great for either task.

Higher fees absolutely do matter. Swift fees are not equivalent to bitcoin transaction fees, because swift is not a currency. USD is a currency and if there was a $20 fee every time you wanted to buy anything with USD it would absolutely damage it's integrity.

Nothing has consensus right now. The lack of consensus is not my reason for not endorsing segwit, I was simply pointing out that it doesnt have consensus and we might have to choose another option.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:19:32
It would be the same amount of changes, it'd simply no longer be presented together as a take it or leave it basket. And doing a hard fork instead of a soft fork isn't the end of the world, infact many would say that's preferable.

2mb increase, followed by flexible transactions and something like transflex would be one option.

You're right, but even conservative estimates say bandwidth has been growing about 10% per year globally, and thats worth taking advantage of.

Segwit, apart from having no concensus, has drawbacks that very well may be worse than the drawbacks of a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:56:32
Well that's your opinion. But apparently not everyone thinks Segwit is the best practical solution, otherwise it would have much higher support. Has it even hit 30% support yet? It's not very useful to the discussion to assume everyone that disagrees with you does so on only ideological grounds.

What? I can buy a 3TB harddrive for $70, which is enough to hold the blockchain 30 times over. Storage is a pretty insignificant cost of running a full node...
@_date: 2016-11-05 16:10:12
Maybe if we had a bit of headroom in transaction capacity we wouldn't be bumping into it so often...
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:07:55
I don't think you understand what I'm saying. If my hand was getting 10% bigger every year (like internet speeds) I would absolutely like my phones to get bigger and thicker over time so that it would remain proportional to my hand size and be comfortable to hold. I don't think a credit card thin phone would be very ergonomic. Eventually my hand would be so big and id be silly to be using this tiny phone that's hard to use and hold with my big beefy fingers. In the same sense I'd like bitcoin's blocksize to increase proportionally to the increasing available bandwidth and storage.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:45:07
Did I say segwit blocks arent bigger? Of course they're bigger, but the economics are different. Segwit increases the effective blocksize to 2mb while increasing the maximum blocksize available to spam transactions to 4mb, while some people would prefer 2mb across the board. That's one difference for you.
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:47:12
Doubling every 7 years sounds great to me. Work on efficiency improvements and 2nd layer solutions in the mean time as well, but to just dismiss a potential no strings attached doubling every 7 years to account for bandwidth improvements would be such a waste.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:49:13
If decentralization is all that matters, why don't we decrease the blocksize to 1kb or so. That way I can run a full node on my gandmothers flip phone with 10mb per month data plan? 
Edit: The point being, at some point, further decentralization doesn't add any value. We have something like 5000 nodes these days. If you can increase the block size by 100% and it only decreases the node count by 1%, you still have 4950 nodes, which has no real negative impact on the network's censorship resistance, and is probaby a good trade off.
Edit 2: And in theory, if you increase the blocksize proportionally to the rate of global bandwidth increases, which is over 10% per year, there should be no real effect on node count over time.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:21:14
Divisibility is irrelevant after a certain point. Bitcoin certainly allows for enough divisibility for it to fuction as a dominant world currency. Your conclusions here don't seem to make much sense.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:02:11


Sounds great, but you have to realize were striking a balance. If increasing node requirements increased transaction throughput by 400% but only reduced the node count by 1%, many people may feel that's a fair trade off. If your definition of Bitcoin's success means EVERYONE can run a full node, you've already failed irreversibly.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:34:05
If there's no peer review, how were the flaws discovered? People are making a good faith effort to provide alternatives to Segwit, since Segwit clearly does not have 95% consensus, and you just make fun of it rather than call for collaboration. You're truly a toxic personality.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:05:19
But global bandwidth is distributed too. When the global bandwidth increases by 10% that means the bandwidth between each and every node has increased by an average of 10% each, so I'm not sure what the problem is.
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:58:28




That's great. But why would that mean it's not a good idea to increase block size to keep up with bandwidth availability? It's not like raising the block size means you have to give up working on other scaling solutions.

That's fine. You're free to censor your subreddit as you please. Call it guideline enforcement or whatever term you please because the end result is the same. I was responding to a comment in which the poster claimed that he didn't think there were many people who disagreed with him, and I was simply pointing out that there are alot of people in the other subreddit who might disagree with him. 
The fact that they were compelled to create a forum where they can speak more openly about issues that matter to them doesn't make them cease to exist or make their opinions count less. 
Some r/bitcoin readers might be confused when segwit has trouble activating because in this subreddit they can't see the opposition.

Quit the bullshit. R/btc moderation logs are public unlike r/bitcoin. If r/bitcoin wasn't overly censored why do you think a third of the reddit Bitcoin community willingly isolated themselves in a less populated forum?

How many nodes do you want? Last time I checked there were still over 5000. Have you ever considered that the increasing availability and ease of use of SPV wallets and hosted wallets and the like have led to some people feeling like their needs are met with those and don't need to bother running a full node, and not necessarily that they were forced out by the resources required?

At full 1mb blocks the Bitcoin blockchain is growing at what, 50GB per year? At that rate, I can buy a 3TB harddrive for $70 that can store the blockchain for the next 58 years. If we increase the blocksize to 2mb I can still store the blockchain for the next 29 years with a harddrive that will be truly ancient by the time it gets full and I need to upgrade. Storage costs are simply not a significant cost of running a full node.

Assuming the majority decides to raise the block limit, bitcoin can't split into two coins because the difficulty adjustment period of bitcoin is 86,000 times longer than etherium, which males a persistant chain split many orders of magnitude more expensive than it was for etherium .
 Unless core changes the proof of work or lowers the difficulty adjustment period. Then it's on core for causing the split.

In this case the peso was not "subdivided" to hide inflation. The opposite actually. Many became one, which would be a consolidation, not a subdivision. It was also renamed. The word peso was simply redefined by the issuing authority to equal 1000 of the old pesos. This consolidation and renaming didn't actually create any value change though. If you had 1 million pesos, you now have 1000 pesos, but the used farm truck you were going to buy for 1 million pesos, now only costs 1000 pesos. So nothing actually changed, you still have one used farm truck worth of value.
Inflation is a different matter and is completely unrelated to renaming the currency to be some multiple or fraction of the old currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:36:06
Absolutely, but the cost of CPU power and storage is decreasing faster than bandwidth is, which means bandwidth is the bottleneck, so bandwidth is the critical metric, and over time storage and CPU power become negligible costs when compared to the bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:20:02
Sure, storage density is a separate factor. But if everything that limited practical physical size of a battery increased by at least 10% every year (like the limits on blocksize do), why not increase the physical size to reflect that?

Maybe it'd be affected at 4mb at current mean bandwidth speeds, but assuming 10% bandwidth speed growth, you get a doubling every 7 years. Which means if we had 1mb in 2009 2mb would be the equivalent today, and in 7 years we could safely bump it to 4mb blocks with the same bandwidth speed to max block size ratio.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:13:01


Not at all. Apparently we both agree that blocksize increases, along with optimizations, and 2nd layer solutions are all important to future scaling. The problem seems to be that your Segwit proposal contains other changes that dont have consensus and has been stuck at 25% support. It's not going to activate. We need a way to increase blocksize as bandwidth availability increases without having to bundle the increase with other more controversial changes every few years. Why don't we take advantage now of the fact that there seems to be consensus that the  blocksize should increase to reflect bandwidth increases, and then deal with malleability seperately. Otherwise neither is going to happen and that's not helpful.
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:42:11

Wouldn't we all like to base it on something more concrete? But just because the effects are hard to predict doesn't mean those effects aren't important. 
If you could maximize the usefulness of a system by focusing on the technical realities and ignoring the economic realities of those decisions, then a completely controlled and engineered economy like a communist state would undoubtably be the most efficient. Sometimes economic parameters like blocksize would be best decided by market participants rather than central planners.

If you were too dense to catch it, my point in this comment thread was to point out the rediculous strawman argument that hed think it a good idea to build a decentralized network in his basement, by creating aN equally rediculous strawman argument that that your camp thinks we need extreme decentralization at all costs, even if it means crippling the network to where blocksize are small enough to run a full node on a flip phone.
Also, you are wanting to change things. The idea that we should leave the blocksize at 1mb indefinately is in fact a change from the original intent, which was that the limit would be increased as needed and in line with the growth of available computing resources.
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:43:48

But don't be surprised or act offended when you do that and people call you out for censorship.

@_date: 2016-12-14 00:18:02
Absolutely nothing. My post was meant to point out that a balance has to be struck. You cant have 100% decentralization. My personal view is to increase the blocksize by something like 10% per year, which leaves the blocksize proportional to average global bandwidth speeds over time. Other people who prefer BU want miners to make the decision instead of the limit being handed down from the core devs. Theres something to be said for the decision coming about from a real time market system rather than a centrally planned decree.
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:47:41
Ignoring the fact that bandwidth increases and storage costs decreases over time is pretty ignorant. Over the long term, you CAN scale simply by increasing the blocksize. Should we work on other solution as well in the meantime? Sure, but dismissing larger blocks as 'not scaling' is not thinking long term.

Well for one thing, the average hand size of a human isn't increasing by any appreciable amount every year, so no, cellphone battery size cannot comfortably be increased every year.
However, the average global bandwidth speed is increasing by over 10% per year so you can make a decent case for scaling bitcoin with blocksize increases.
Edit: With 10% growth per year that means you can double capacity about every 7 years, which is nothing to scoff at.

Its not about just any scaling, its about onchain scaling for the miners. You said it youself though, Segwit increases the size of a potential spam block to 3.7MB while only allowing about 2mb of real transactions. Miners want to optimize onchain scaling, and having the max blocksize have to be cut in half forever because of the potential spam blocksize segwit adds, is inefficient in the long run. That seems like a problem with segwit more than it is a problem with a HF.

Flag Days dont measure consensus. The developer just makes the change to the software to activate on a certain date and hopes that miners continue to mine on the chain and users continue to buy their tokens after the flag day.

Lol sure, some things can. But we're talking about real effects on the real network here. If you were using a priori assumptions to argue that a 95% of miners would infact fork away from a vast majority of users you might have a logical argument, even if you were ultimately incorrect. 
All you've proven is that a hypothetical example exists, but theres no indication that it would ever happen in real life, so why would such a hypothetical have any bearing on how we define a contentious hard fork?

Thats the key. No one on the other side actually believes you want to allow a followup blocksize increase in any reasonable timeframe. If you want their support, you need to now determine under what conditions the next increase will happen, and make that explicit with a guarantee they can trust. After segwit, you'll just say we dont need more onchain transaction capacity, just use lightning network instead! Many people feel like pushing lightning network and refusing to increase blocksize creates a situation in which network security is diminished by artificially forcing value off the main chain. Lightning Network has many uses, but you cant force people to use it like this. It needs to compete against a base layer which is not stunted by those who have an interest in the layers above.

Softforks are 'safe' by default? Are you high? In the same way that segwit increases blocksize by reorganizing transaction format and hiding the signature data in a spot that old nodes don't recognize and therefor don't count into maxblocksize, I could use a new transaction format that generates coins beyond the original 21m coins. That's technically a softfork, but is it 'safe', or otherwise a good idea?
Besides, it's more accurate to say that softforks are forward compatible because the old transaction format is still valid in segwit. If segwit was fully backwards compatible, old nodes would be able to actually verify the new segwit transactions, but they cant. They're not full nodes anymore because they're not verifying all the transactions they recieve.
The only advantage of a softfork is that in most cases a softfork is less likely to chainsplit. But with UASF without majority hashpower, you're just as likely to chainsplit as a hardfork.

This is hilarious. It is my contention that the original Satoshi client implements this vision.


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.
You claim that in this case the longest chain is not "valid" because the consensus rules were changed. However that definition of validity in this regard is only *your opinion*, yet you present it as fact. I don't see any divine rule that prevents the change of a consensus rule through above mentioned majoirty decision making of mining. I would only consider the change "invalid" in any sense of the word, if that change was rejected by the vast majority of the ecosystem, not simply because there was a change. Also, miners have an interest in not making a consensus change that is rejected by the economic majority, so the risk of veto is minimized by their own self interest.

You don't decide the terms on which a fork gains the title "bitcoin". Language is an emergent process that evolves over time. If we fork with 95% consensus good luck forcing that 95% to call their tokens something other than bitcoin if bitcoin is what they want to call them. And good luck getting 95% of people to accept your minority fork bitcoins, even if you insist they're the "real" bitcoins.
Edit: In any sense that matters, the majority decides what is or is not bitcoin. If you hold to some technical definition of bitcoin as the pre-fork chain in which the consensus rules never change, no one has to convince you otherwise....your coins are still worth jack shit if the majority disagrees with you.

No significant opposition from developers
Implementation and support from all significant development teams
Letters of support and commitment to run the client across industry
Node flagging
Miner flagging
No significant opposition at conferences/meetups
Node flagging can be sybil attacked. Who decides what "significant opposition" is at a conference? Let me guess, you invite a bunch of your buddies who agree with you to a conference and then declare that there is no significant opposition. Even if a few people crash your party, they werent "significant". None of your other metrics measure normal users.
Edit: The difficulty of this problem is why miners exist...because non-mining users cannot be accurately measured. Mining gives them a voter ID card and proves they exist and have a stake in the system.

You clearly know people are running UASF code. There are links and instructions and people claiming to run it all over these forums, not just instructions on how to add a flag.
Even people who were not flagging BIP101/xt/classic, let alone actually running the code, we're banned from this forum for disscussing the IDEA of it. You lose a lot of credibility by pretending that that was somehow materially different from what's going on now. The difference is merely that Theymos and co. likes this idea, and didn't like the others.

If you know that the limit is huge and unsafe, what is the limit specifically? Why couldn't the limit be set to, say, 4mb, and then in a few years increase it again to 8mb. It'd only take a soft fork to raise the extension block size limit, right?

I could be wrong, but I believe extension blocks can be used to increase the effective blocksize even further in the future, while segwit seems to be a one time bump. That seems like a big difference to me.
You coming out so strong against extension blocks by attacking the motives and funding of the devs involved plays right into the narrative that Blockstream wants to limit onchain scaling at all costs.
@_date: 2017-04-02 05:05:40


Regardless of the "intentions" of the designers of segwit, in the long run it serves to limit onchain scaling and facilitate offchain scaling. Especially when you use the exentence of segwit to argue against EVER having a HF blocksize increase like many people do. Miners are obviously not pleased with Core's proposal.


Thats pretty questionable. transaction fees were about 12% of a miner's revenue last I looked, 88% block reward. It would only take a 14% drop in the price of bitcoin for transaction fee revenue to be entirely negated. Entirely. Theres a pretty good chance that the 2 years of stalling, slowed progress, community divide has affected the price potential of bitcoin by at least 14%.

So the will of the bitcoin ecosystem doesnt matter, we are bound forever to the will of satoshi? No, bitcoin is a work in process. Luckily Satoshi explained clearly that the network could be changed through hardforks.
To fit the example above, its as if the legislature (satoshi) defined a 3 lane bridge, but before the bridge was completed the legislature had an election. The new legislature votes for the addition of an extra lane to be tacked on (now 4 lanes) since its been a while since the original compromise was made and traffic has increased.

Interesting, you think xt guaranteed a split by requiring 75% hashpower, but UASF is somehow more safe by activating with 0%-70% hashpower.
Replay protection is a bit of a red herring, it wasn't even being talked about back then because bitcoin isn't etherium, and if someone cared about their minority fork coins they can take precautions themselves. Really more of the minority chain's problem.
Not having "Wipeout protection" and checkpoints seems to be a pet peeve of yours, but most people don't seem to think it's important.
UASF looks pretty fucking hostile so I don't think that's a difference.

@_date: 2017-04-01 18:22:10


No, even in that extreme example, you will oppose it because its not economically feasible for you to buy a data center to validate your transactions. I'm sorry you're simply pretending, perhaps subconsciously, that this is a 'technical issue' to justify your desire for to overweight the opinions of software developers as to how big the blocksize should be.


Well your reasoning is wrong because technically it is possible for you to build a massive data center to verify your tranactions, it just may not be financially feasible for you to do so. For Coinbase, however it might be financially possible and worthwhile.
If you defined a goal up front, that people with a node of 'x' computing resources should be able to run a full node, you could use technical arguements to determine whether that goal could be met at a given blocksize. But you're making the economic judgement up front in this case by defining the minimum system resources that you want to be able to run a node. The economic judgement is the hard part. Its fairly simple to determine what is technically the maxblocksize after you have made the economic judgement of defining the minimum system requirements.
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:06:04


I'd say thats definately an advantage in getting them to activate, since they basically sneak by other nodes without getting consent for the change they want. Whether thats desirable or not is another question. 
In theory you could have a softfork which indirectly increases the 21m coin limit and creates new coins that old nodes do not recognize as new coins, and so do not explicitly reject transactions that contain them. The new coins could affect the value of the original 21m coins if someone was willing to buy the new ones instead for some non-zero price.
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:02:18
But its still 'technically' possible to validate your own txs with even 8mb blocks. You're just making an economic judgement that its not financially worth doing so for an acceptable percentage of node users.

I'm not talking about what you personally 'condemn', rather, what has been allowed to be discussed on this forum. Just talking about xt/classic in any way that was not outright dismissive was interpreted as 'promoting it'.

@_date: 2017-04-01 18:55:42


Yes you can. If you define your economic goals upfront, you can determine if those goals are technically possible. But the economic goalpost exists independant of the technical implementation and viability of the goal.


Exactly, you could make a technical argument that 8mb blocks may be too big to run at home with the median bandwidth available to a person in, for example, Yemen. But for that to be relevant you have made an economic judgement that the ideal system requirements are low enough that its possible to run a full node with the bandwidth available to the median Yemeni home. If you change the goal to being able to run a VPS node then you have changed the economic goal that you are trying to see is technically possible.
In short, in order to make a technical argument as to what max blocksize is possible, you first have to define how big the minimum system requirements can become while still being acceptable economically. 
The economic judgement has to come first, then you can decide the maxblocksize that is technically appropriate to meet those goals. In the software-centric bitcoin world, the fact that an economic judgement is being made, and the significance of that judgement, seems to be lost on many people, and that contributes to the breakdown in communication we have.
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:17:31
Will it? Can you guarantee that? If you UASF with minority hashpower it's very likely that blocks would be found slowly enough to drive fees through the roof, and theres a high probability that the transaction will not have enough fees to be included in the slower UASF chain.

Because segwit is only a one time bump to the blocksize limit and doesn't solve the underlying problem. We can't just can kick down the road again, it leads to market uncertainty and disincentivizes investment in the Bitcoin space. We need to have the next bump baked into whatever we choose to do for this bump, or have some kind of automatic increase, or a system like BU which allows the next bump to take place without 3 years of stalling, or a system like extension blocks which is basically like segwit but makes it easier to increase the blocksize in the future when in inevitably needed.
It's naive to dismiss someone's reasons for supporting something as "political". In any system of value in which more than one person involved there is politics. Money is political in nature. If you thint that doesn't apply to bitcoin, I have a bridge to sell you. There are core devs that are claiming segwit itself is a political compromise because 2mb is already too big in their eyes. So don't pretend segwit is immune from political influence and all the other options are just "politics".

A tip of the hand, if you will, for those who wish to minimize chain growth. If you wanted to be partisan, it makes sense that youd downplay the effects of that risk now, and then after segwit activates play up those risks that you previously dismissed.

@_date: 2017-04-01 20:29:09
Why do you think the UASF results in a more 'unified' network than a hardfork with the same initial support?
You say a hard fork cannot result in a unified network in the face of minority resistance. The minority resistance would have to accept using a lower coin value if they refuse to rejoin the main chain. The incentive to deal with getting rid of minority resistance in a UASF is the exact same, you're threatening the value of the minority's coins. 
It's basically a difference of who's making the first move, miners or users. If you assume the same initial level of support of both miners and users, the end result should be basically the same, regardless of which one take the initiative of first action.
Edit: The UASF is basically a threat that says, accept the soft fork or else we hard fork....at the end of the day its really a hard fork despite the name.

Just because something is 'backwards compatible' doesnt mean the economics of the system remains static. It was a surprise to most people that a backward compatible soft fork could raise the blocksize. Theoretically itd be possible to issue new coins and 'effectively' (just like segwit does not directly affect the max blocksize parameter but works around it) increase the 21m coin limit through some kind of convoluted softfork as well. The new coins would not be usable by nodes not using the new transaction format, they wouldnt recogize the new coins as being new coins, but that wouldnt change the new coins from affecting the economics of mining and fees if someone was willing to buy them.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:42:18
You're not thinking longterm. We need to accept that we need to allow hf for blocksize increases. Given advances in bandwidth, a steady regimen of blocksize increases could give us VISA level throughput in 30 years.

@_date: 2017-04-30 15:07:29
If there was any indication that LN would instantly reduce transaction fees back below 5 cents or so and keep it there indefinately, sure thatd be great. But even with the most optimistic projections on adoption of LN it would take years. The prudent thing to do would be to increase blocksize now while it's needed. If you find 5-10 years down the road that LN has made the blocksize excessively large relative to demand, it would only take a softfork to lower it if that was a good idea.
Also, you don't get to decide who is a part of bitcoin, sorry.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:51:21
Extension blocks has already had a covert asic boost block added, so that's not an issue.
Segwit might be 'safe', but it's not going to activate because it's contentious. I'm not sure a UASF form of segwit is very safe though. I think you'll have more users than you think who don't join the UASF attempt and then it becomes a very dangerous risk of chain split.

Dude, everyone knows segwit gives 2mb. 
But in the long run segwit's 2mb is less effective for onchain scaling than a 2mb HF + quadratic scaling fix because never-hard-fork fanatics will point to segwit and say, the maxblockweight is alreay 4mb, if you double throughput it will have to be **8MB**!
You can debate that point but please stop pretending that people dont understand segwit gives 2mb capacity.

So now you're saying promoting a softfork without widespread consensus is ok (and UASF is SEVERELY stretching the definition of a softfork, if you want to call it that at all), but a hardfork isnt? Even if that's your position, that's not what the forum rules have been. It's funny that some people think that just because a softfork is (mostly) backwards compatible, that means anything is magically fair game. But is it still backwards compatible if the whole point of the proposal is blacklisting any miners or nodes that haven't upgraded? LOL
By the way, it only has an 'asymmetric advantage' if there isn't a competing miner activated soft fork. Also, a softfork can indeed create new coins. Those new coins would not be visible to old nodes but that doesn't prevent them from diluting the value of the original 21m coins.

I was waiting for this comment because it always comes. 
Yes segwit increases throughput, but it's not the same as a straight blocksize increase. You know why? Moving the signature data outside the blocksize calculation like segwit does can only be done once. It's a one trick pony. However, you can raise the maxblocksize as many times as needed. 2-3 years ago the 1 mb bump from segwit might have been enough. At this point we're already at the point maxblocksize needs to be raised directly.

You might not consider preventing any change to the network as a threat, but in this context what you think about your own actions does not matter. What matters is how the people who you have supposedly offered a compromise view your actions.


We could go back and forth trying to claim the moral high ground here. "No fair, he hit me first!" Its really irrelevant. Many consider that small blockers have attacked the network already by refusing to HF long ago. You might say you cant attack something by leaving it the same. I could refer you to the concept of   . If you have a collar on a puppy and intentionally dont loosen the collar as it grows, you've left it the same and at the same time ultimately killed it. In the end argueing for the moral high ground is irrelevant to Bitcoin.


You act like you can only threaten someone with direct monetary harm. You can also threaten someone's influence and power in a group (edit:which may or may not have monetary side effects).


Now you want to act like theres a clear distinction between needs and wants in this case?


My point is that your "friendly compromise" of 2mb segwit resulted from the threat that segwit without a capacity increase would be more likely rejected by the community. You claim segwit was not political bargaining like segwit2mb, only 'friendly compromise'. Im trying to point out the fact that youve only described the same thing with different words, and have made no distinction between the two.
I have to go now. I hope you will reconsider your rejection of segwit alternatives on the moral high ground of rejecting 'political bargaining' and threats and realize that the 'segwit compromise' contains those same things you claim to be seeking to avoid.

@_date: 2017-04-01 18:35:40
So a user activated soft fork with anything less than unanimous support will result in a permanent chain split just like a hard fork would. You're simply making a guess that UASF is more likely to get unanimous support than a HF. In both cases you're incentivizing support for the main chain by having the value of your coins impacted if you remain on a minority chain.

So you claim that Bitcoin is free of politics if it NEVER changes. Even if Segwit gets implemented as a softfork only you've made a political change.

Thats not necessarily a bad thing but the process of making that change is inherently political in nature because it changes the economics of the system.

I guess you dont like the term blacklist? Well what do you want to call it when a non-uasf node receives a payment in a non segwit block after the uasf activation time, and your aim is to orphan that block, and invalidate a previously valid transaction?
It's a hardfork for miners and any node that's not running UASF code. The only people it's really a softfork for are the people running the UASF code, so you're forcing a hardfork on everyone else.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:05:14
And? Are you saying a softfork is not a consensus change? A softfork can alter the protocol just as much as a hardfork can.
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:21:46
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:51:13


If a "user activated softfork" has majority hashpower behind it, then by definition its just a normal softfork. The UASF is only unique in that it activates even with minority hashpower (under the assumption that the minority hashpower chain will survive if it has strong economic support), and with minority hashpower there is a great likelyhood of chain split.

This is primarily an economic aspect of the protocol. The argument that blocks are too big is not a technical arguement. Its an economic judgement that the benefits of a bigger blocksize are not enough to justify a predicted drop (predicted with economic judgements) in the number of people who are willing to run nodes, or that the economics of the distribution of miner profitability will be affected and change their distribution. 
You can say with technical arguements that segwit is a valid way forward and is bug free, but to say its the "best" way forward requires economic judgements which are by definition political in nature. I think The 2mb HF + segwit idea Sergio put forward is an idea that has a good chance of gaining support and can likely be made viable in regards to any true technical concerns.
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:21:47
So you'd rather do a UASF, which is in effect a hardfork because you're blacklisting any nodes and miners that haven't upgraded? So youll hardfork in order to prevent a hardfork? Makes you go hmmmm....
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:01:34


Umm...you might want to look into that. To old nodes segwit transactions are disguised as 'anyone can spend' and they have no way to actually verify them. By trying to force a change that would otherwise be a hardfork-increasing the blocksize-into a softfork, what you sacrifice is the ability of old nodes to actually verify those segwit transactions. So it's not fully backwards compatible. It might be mostly backwards compatible, but in a very important way, it is infact not compatible.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:42:02
Im sorry.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:01:06
Explain to me then how a softfork that involves blacklisting unupgraded nodes, is materially any better than a hardfork. 
The hardfork/softfork distinction is a crappy, relatively new, pair of phrases coined to justify a preference for changes that can be snuck by old unupgraded nodes. LukeJr is calling extension blocks a hardfork even though by the definition that most people have always been using, it's as much a softfork as segwit.
If you have to blacklist unupgraded nodes to make the "soft"fork work, what have you gained by avoiding a "hard"fork?
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:27:01
I understand very clearly. What you need to understand is that Segwit does not exist in a vaccum. There are many people that want segwit + 2mb hf (8mb blockweight) and think that segwit works well in that scenario but does not work well in the situation in which we have segwit alone. In the eyes of those people, segwit does have merit, but not by itself.
Edit: You cannot reasonably ask people to judge segwit in a vacuum independant of the effect they perceive that its activation would have on future consensus.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:56:46


You pretend that there is no nuance in those numbers. You ignore the fact that there are long term effects on the network that could affect your value assesment of the short term gain. The benefit to the health of the network from 2mb with segwit is not exactly 50% of potential benefit of 4mb with segwit + hf. There are differences in implementation and tradeoffs which affect more than just the raw throughput.
Imagine this situation. I owe you $1000 for a job. I claim that I only owe you $500 and that I want a release of liability in exchange of my $500, otherwise you get nothing, and $500 is better than nothing so itd be irrational for you to decline my offer, right? You ignore that the options you present me are not the only options. Perhaps I can take you to small claims court and get the full amount, and only then will you get your release. 
Segwit does not provide the onchain scaling that I believe is neccessary, furthermore by accepting segwit alone I feel that what I want is less likely to happen in the future, just as by accepting $500 with a release of liability, youre much less likely to get your full $1000.

The quote you find so objectionable claims that segwit increases 1.1mb, making it 2.1mb total. It also claims the debate has been going on 2-3 years, which I guess you could disagree on how long the debate has raged - some people might say the debate has been going on for 5-6 years...which might be true in a way, but certainly didnt reach its curent form until more recently. So, which do you have a problem with?
Or are you simply whining about my opinion that segwit would have been enough of an increase in the past but not now?
Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:08:15


Thats because in such a project, the political compromise has already been done by the time the engineer gets his budget for materials. 
If the engineer was the one having to decide how many lanes of traffic the bridge was going to have, he'd have to appease republicans who might only want a cheaper bridge with 2 lanes, and democrats who might want a more expensive bridge with 4 lanes. The reality is the political compromise has been made before it ever gets to the engineers, the legislature approves a 3 lane bridge of medium cost.
In bitcoin the roles are not so clearly defined. There is no legislature to dictate to our software engineers how many "lanes" our blocksize will have. So yes, in our case the engineers will have to have a more active role in the political compromise that has to take place to reach a decision. To discard any compromise on principle is naive.

See my response to jonny.


You cant know that for a fact because node counts and signaling can be sybil attacked. Its simply your prediction. My prediction is that most nodes would infact switch to a 99% miner majority chain. In any case, why would 99% of miners make a rule change that they thought the economic majority would not follow along with? I believe miners can define any rule change that they do not believe would end up with a user veto.
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:01:17

The term "blitz" implies they're using the media in some kind of war, which is why I took issue with the term. I don't care that they're communicating with the media. If someone claimed they "solved the scaling debate" as you claim, thatd be a bit silly and premature. Who said that exactly?

What about it? I had a specific comment to make to him about him downplaying a critical difference between segwit and extension blocks, and him spreading FUD about the extention blocks devs, so I said what I wanted to say.
We could also discuss how nullc dishonestly presents bitmain as trying to prevent LN at all costs, when infact they want LN, they just don't want to cripple onchain scaling to get it. You cant force LN on people by artificially having stupidly small blocks indefinately, LN has to compete with a main chain that is allowed to develop to its full potential.

I'm well aware that segwit is an immediate increase. It allows an extra 1.1mb or so. That might have been sufficient 2-3 years ago when this debate started.
The problem is that you think Segwit is the exact same thing as a direct blocksize increase when it simply isnt. Segwit is a one trick pony. You can only move the signature data outside the maxblocksize calculation, as segwit does, once. However, you can increase the maxblocksize directly with a hard fork as many times as needed. That's one of the reasons a direct increase of maxblocksize is superior to segwit as a capacity increase.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:49:43

Just wanted to point out that Bitcoin is unique because its a censorship resistant decentralized electronic monetary system. The fact that the userbase still has to compromise or engage in "political bargaining" isnt neccesarily bad. The Federal Reserve has so many artificial barriers to entry that prevents anyone but representatives of the major banks from having any input. Bitcoin allows more direct input from users, which results in a more politicized system because the power is spread out more widely and any proposals need to have overwhelming support from those users to move forward, which leads to bargaining to gain support. On the otherhand, the Federal Reserve can just ignore users and move forward unilaterally because they use the violence of forced taxation to back their dollar, no bargaining required.
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:35:32

Yes, Greg Maxwell has been making statements trying to slander everyone involved with the extension block proposal as being funded by miners:


announcement of a protocol change that-- rather than being sent for community review in any plausible venue for that purpose-- was announced as a done deal in embargoed media announcements.  This proposed protocol change seemed custom tailored to preserve covert boosting, and incorporated direct support for lightning -- and the leading competing theory was that a large miner opposed segwit specifically because they wanted to block lightning. Moreover, I have heard reports I consider reliable that this work was funded by the miner in question.

Change to any system which has value and involves more than one person is inherently political. "Motivated for political reasons" doesnt make any sense here, because any change that even remotely changes the economics of the system is by defination political. Segwit is just as political as a HF so you can't dismiss one as a "political change" and the other not. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 08:43:33


Even a 'friendly' compromise is political in nature. What you don't seem to realize is that your proposal seems to us just as much a threat, as our proposal seems a threat to you. You threaten that you will reject a blocksize increase if it doesnt come in the form of segwit. We threaten to reject segwit if it does not come with a hard fork. Hell, some people are threatening anti-segwit miners with a POW change. There are threats on both sides.


This depends on how you define the terms. Bitcoin was designed under the premise that miners will behave because of the threat of having their blocks orphaned. Edit: Users threaten to make develepers irrelevant and reject their software if they put out code to which there is a better alternative. There are implied threats throughout the Bitcoin system which makes it work.
You keep talking about "friendly compromise". There would be no need for compromise at all if there was no kind of threat to mitigate. 
Imagine this:  I have a neighbor that wants to remove a tree that sits on the property line between our land. I want the tree to stay in all its natural glory. But as a "friendly compromise" I offer to just trim some of the branches up. Whether you call it "friendly" or not the compromise was made in order to mitigate the threat that the neighbor would cut down the tree. Even if there was nothing but smiles the threat is still there. (Edit: show me an example of any "friendly compromise" and ill show you a threat at its core, that drives it.)

The only things that are beyond the control of political processes are things in which there is no value at stake, or things in which that value is firmly centralized by one person.

@_date: 2017-04-11 05:04:22
What do you mean by that? You mean it had a built in miner activation threshhold?
Edit: If that's what you're talking about, I find this position entirely illogical. 
UASF makes NO effort to not break consensus. None at all. If there isn't overwhelming support, you're explicitly trusting every UASF node to stop running the software so that they don't break consensus.
Bitcoin Classic had the same safety feature as UASF...just don't run the software if it looks like it's contentious. On top of that, it ensured a supermajority of miner support as a baseline to prevent nodes from forking themselves off the network. The 'enforcement mechanism' you mention served only to further limit the chance of it actually activating if there was not consensus.
So software like UASF that has NO protections against activating without consensus are ok, and software like the original bitcoin classic that attempts to prevent a contentious fork is banned?
The hypocrisy is deafening...Are you experiencing any cognitive dissonance yet or should we go deeper?
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:41:20
Nothing currently has broad and overwhelming support, not even segwit or UASF. Doesnt mean we cant discuss options.

I guess software developers arent part of the 'community' by your definition either. You are talking about some theoretical future community after a chain split.
Tell me...what happens if you manage to "fire" the current miners, and the same groups end up being the new miners, because they're the ones with access to cheap/free electricity and labor? Anyways, more likely you fork yourself onto a UASF altcoin worth a tenth of what you had before. 
Anyone with real money at stake isn't going to take that gamble. A big risk of losing everything, and all you get if it pays off is...segwit.
 It's funny, segwit is almost guaranteed to activate if it comes with a 2mb HF like the Hong Kong agreement spelled out. Some people think a HF is too risky because it could lead to a chain split...so some genius decides to do a UASF, which is even more likely to lead to a chain split than a normal hardfork that actually has miner support. You guys are too much.

You clearly dont understand the first thing about the way the world works. Politics exists in any system in which there is value at stake and more than one person is involved. Just because the rules are in software code form doesnt mean theres no politics involved. There is an inherent political interaction between users, miners, and the people writing the code. Humans are still writing the rules, value is at stake, and more than one person is affected...you have a political interaction. To expect otherwise is naive.

Depends, softforks don't seem to have much of an advantage to a hardfork if the softfork has a high chance of causing a chainsplit anyways. Looks alot like a hardfork when you end up with 2 different chains after it, even if you can 'technically' call it a softfork.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:36:21
Here you dismiss segwit+2mb HF because it's a "political compromise", yet previously I've been hearing segwit was *already a political compromise* because it includes 2.1mb throughput already. So by your logic I guess we should shun segwit because it's also a political compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:36:09
What if that node recieved a non segwit transaction in a non segwit block? The whole point of uasf is to invalidate that previously valid transaction. He definately been "defrauded" at that point.
You are also incorrect that softforks cannot cause inflation. Segwit was able to increase blocksize as a softfork because it hides signature information in a way that old nodes don't recognize so they don't count it against the blocksize limit. In the same way you could create new coins in a way that old nodes aren't aware that the transaction has created new coins. Old nodes would not be able to use the new coins, just as they can't fully validate segwit transactions, but that would not prevent the new coins from diluting the value of the original 21m coins if there was anyone willing to buy them. 
Theres literally no benefit to a softfork besides the fact that in theory it's mostly backwards compatible, and with the uasf you remove that one benefit by orphaning non segwit blocks that were supposed to be valid under segwit. It's no longer backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:12:31
My point is that the only real way to measure consensus is through miner voting. The will of the economic majority can only be determined *after the fact* by relative price of the two coins.

Theres a big difference between these coins and altcoins, and thats that these coins would be being transmitted by the Bitcoin network and stored by the Bitcoin blockchain. 


Except that the goal of the UASF is to eventually gain majority hashpower and reorg the non-uasf chain. Unless your goal is to have a perpetual chain split which seems pretty counterproductive.
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:58:17
The longest chain defines the rules of their chain by definition. Users always have the option to veto those rules by moving to a minority hashpower chain. I dont care which one you label 'bitcoin'. It is what it is.

Then they won't run the hard fork. We use mining to come to an initial decision because it's the only metric that can't be gamed. Users are free to reject the miners and create an economic majority fork if what you say is true, which is unlikely.

FULL TEXT:
"When the concept of Bitcoin was first introduced on a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto, certain developers purported to have already “proven that decentralized consensus was impossible”. Today, the same developers offer a similarly specious “proof” that the implementation of long-published ASIC optimizations is some kind of “attack” on the Bitcoin network.
We’d like to clear the air.
Bitmain has tested ASICBOOST on the Testnet but has never used ASICBOOST on the mainnet as implied in Gregory Maxwell’s proposal. We ask conclusive proof from whoever claims this to be false because such baseless claims are toxic for the Bitcoin space. We also believe the math used by Gregory Maxwell is incorrect and that the method is not practical in a production environment.
Our ASIC chips, like those of some other manufacturers, have a circuit design that supports ASICBOOST. However, the ASICBOOST method has not been used by us on the mainnet. We have not seen any evidence yet on the main net that anyone has used it in the patented way.
Bitmain holds the ASICBOOST patent in China. We can legally use it in our own mining farms in China to profit from it and sell the cloud mining contracts to the public. This, however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin.
The mining equipment produced by Bitmain for its own use is in no way intended to be technically superior or more power-efficient than the equipment it sells to the public. The ASICBOOST method has not been employed by Bitmain to increase the power-efficiency of the miners in its own mining farms.
Bitcoin mining equipment depreciates rapidly. Bitmain has constantly been introducing newer more efficient miner models for all. As such the statement that the deployment of ASICBOOST, which can lead to a 20% difference in power efficiency, is some kind of negative development for Bitmain’s business model is false. Bitmain has shown the ability to adapt and thrive in the constantly changing and extremely challenging Bitcoin mining environment. Whether ASICBOOST is used or not, Bitmain will continue to produce more efficient miners.
Bitmain had always supported the Hong Kong Agreement, which means Segwit plus a hard fork to 2MB block size, until we no longer felt that it was going to happen in the foreseeable future. In fact, Bitmain is publicly on record as historically supporting SegWit and Lightning Network in the context of the Hong Kong agreement, and any accusations to the contrary are completely false and specious.
Miners love multi-layer solutions like Lightning Network. To support these off-chain solutions, Bitmain is very supportive of fixing malleability issues. At the same time, we also believe the first layer, which has been well-tested by time, is very important and should not be crippled. We are worried about the policy and precedence set by Bitcoin Core in this regard.
“Tothemoon”, an extension blocks plan proposed recently by Purse.io using a new Bitcon protocol implementation called Bcoin, could be designed to be incompatible with ASICBOOST much like Segwit is. ASICBOOST is not a deterrent to Bitmain’s support of SegWit or Tothemoon. SegWit is not running in production because the conditions made clear in the Hong Kong agreement have not been met, in which we foresee a non-witness block size increase coming together with SegWit. Bitmain’s co-CEO Jihan Wu has clearly expressed support for Tothemoon recently. Tothemoon is a real and standard block size increase, but not through an arbitrary witness discount policy.
Gregory Maxwell’s recent proposal suggests changing 2^32 collision to 2^64 collision to make ASICBOOST more difficult. The result of this would be a loss for the patent owners and the Bitcoin protocol. The patent owners will get nothing and Bitcoin protocol will become more complicated. The only beneficiary will be the technical bureaucrats who are engineering it. The more complicated the protocol is, the higher the cost and barrier to have multiple implementations become. We confirm that we support multiple implementations because they will bring more innovation and better security to the network, while threatening the monopolistic position of certain developers.
Bitmain has continuously been advocating for increasing the Bitcoin block size. Increasing the block size will make the collisions even more difficult, damaging the potential benefits of Bitmain’s gain from the private ASICBOOST assumed by Maxwell’s proposal. The conspiracy theories do not add up here.
There are better ways to resolve the issues that Gregory Maxwell’s proposal seeks to address. Adversarial thinking is not the only way. We suggest working with the patent owners so that the patent could be used by the public. If all mining equipment could use ASICBOOST, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the ASICBOOST method is not a “covert attack” on the Bitcoin PoW function. It is an engineering optimization.
The best method to leverage ASICBOOST is by using the Bitcoin block header’s version bits. Patent owner Timo has mentioned it in the patent. Gregory Maxwell’s proposal seems to be missing this point. Usage of these bits was proposed by Timo Hanke through Bitcoin Core’s BIP process but it was declined by Gregory Maxwell and Core developers.
Bitcoin Core is now almost controlled by a small secretive committee. Anyone with a basic sense about human history can tell that this is the starting of a dictatorship. Calling out an optimization an “attack” is playing a political trick to grab power.
The proposal mentions “reverse engineering of a particular mining chip demonstrated conclusively that ASICBOOST has been implemented”. This statement seems directed towards Bitmain. We believe the Bitcoin community needs more constructive contributors than it needs such policing.
The proposal does not mention Bitmain, however, an orchestrated troll army within the community was effectively able to spread rumors around Bitmain. Most Bitcoin companies currently have a strong fear of such notorious assets working for certain people. Bitcoin’s value of liberty is in danger.
The Bitcoin community suffered a grave misfortune when Maxwell lead the coup against Gavin Andresen and removed his Github commit access. It is now incumbent upon us as a community to figure out how to find a new core developer group that does not busy itself with attacking one of Bitcoin’s largest investors (Ver), one of its largest exchanges (Coinbase), and its largest mining equipment provider (Bitmain).
There is a history of character assassinations against those who have spoken against SegWit or Core’s roadmap. Gregory Maxwell’s latest round of attempts follow his previous patterns. Maxwell has previously attacked one of most important Bitcoin maintainers Gavin Andresen, one of the earliest public Bitcoin advocates and investors Roger Ver, founder and CEO of one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges Brian Armstrong, the first author of Lightning Network Joseph Poon, and now Bitmain’s co-CEO Jihan Wu. He has even called his fellow Core contributors who signed the Hong Kong agreement “dipshits”. Such hostility is destructive for Bitcoin.
We have very firm belief that the block size of Bitcoin will be increased. It is the Bitcoin that our co-founders signed up for, it is the roadmap designed by Satoshi and it is the destiny of Bitcoin. We will protect it at any cost."
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:29:37


Part of that fear comes from the fact that Core appears intent on crippling the main chain by refusing a hard fork blocksize increase ever, in order to incentivize layer 2. If you allow the main chain to grow to a more reasonable level, layer 2 will have to compete on its own merits for users, rather than users being forced onto it by central planning.

It's all semantics. What's the benefit of a softfork over a hardfork when you're blacklisting all unupgraded nodes anyways? Might as well have used a hardfork.
You claim that UASF would not blacklist non-mining nodes in "any way". The reality is that if the non-mining node is relaying non-segwit blocks, which it will, and you're rejecting those blocks, you have effectively blacklisted that node by rejecting blocks which it sees as valid. Perhaps technically you want to say you're not blacklisting the node itself, just most of the blocks it's relaying, but the effect is still negative to the node.

Maybe you can talk to Sergio, obviously his goal is to make them compatible with eachother.


Its possible to hit the 1mb limit today using only standard transactions, which results in 1mb of effective throughput. Segwit allows about 2.1mb of effective throughput, but increases the blockweight to 4mb, and its possible to create contrived spam transactions and hit that 4mb limit despite it being impossible to send 4mb of regular transactions. So with segwit you have a 2.1mb throughput with a 4mb potential for spam.

This all depends on how you define majority rule. The Federal Reserve Board is one of the furthest human systems from majority rule that you can find if you're measuring majority as a simple head count, based on how many abstracted levels of representation are passed through before a decision is made. If you define the majority as the most well connected financial alliance, then yes its majority rule. But the majority ultimately rules in any situation on this planet when you define majority broadly as power. Someone always defines the rules and the rules can always be changed, in anything on this planet. If you want immutable rules religion may be more to your liking. What makes Bitcoin unique among cryptocurrencies is simply that it was first so has the network effect, which we should maximize. It's not unique because we pretend that it can never be changed.
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:59:20


Theres simply no reason to believe this. The reality of the situation is that if segwit gets activated there will be less impetus for 2 mb HF. The reverse is also true. If 2mb HF gets activated there is less impetus for segwit. So both sides hold out for their prefered version. Segwit2mb is the best compromise we have yet.
Im sure you'd prefer to not compromise at all, but to reject any compromise "on principle" because compromise is "political" is just naive and not very helpful. If you think theres a technical reason Segwit2mb wont work present it to the people making the proposal.

There are people who claim that 60% of the value of oil comes from pure speculation. If it ever got to 75% do you think it should be labeled a ponzi scheme?

This is your key flaw. You assume that every person that owns bitcoin does so as a speculative investor. In reality there are people who buy bitcoins to USE them because the bitcoin network provides them a valuable service by allowing them to transfer value frictionlessly. These are USERS who are putting money into the system. The fact that by using the network they are also invested in it doesn't change that.
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:34:12
Ive been arguing with him on another thread [HERE]( and its devolved into some nitpicking on back and forth points far removed from the original issue. Maybe we can try to get back on track here.
u/Jstolfi Why do you claim that an increase in value for bitcoin investors can only come at the expense of later investors, and is therefore a ponzi scheme, when it is well understood that due to the transactional demand for money the cost of a bitcoin could increase simply due to user demand? 
Do you claim that 100% of bitcoin users only use it for speculation? Even if an asset has 99% speculative value that doesn't make it a ponzi as long as it has an actual use case which users may decide is valuable for them. To fit bitcoin under the definition of a ponzi you have to expand the definition so wide that it encompasses almost any asset, and it becomes clear that your claims are fairly useless.
@_date: 2016-10-16 07:02:35


Actually sometimes instead of dividends or reinvestments, a company will simply buy their own shares in a stock buyback! To say that the method through which that profit is distributed makes it 'more real' than if it were distributed as some other method doesn't make sense, profit is profit regardless of where it shows up. That fact that bitcoins profit shows up as an increase in the value of a bitcoin itself due to higher user demand makes no difference.


If I buy a bitcoin and hold onto it while the network is growing, the transactional demand for money will increase the value of that bitcoin. Why do you say that the value from that demand is not 'real'? How is the value that presents itself as increased price of Western Union shares materially different or more 'real' than the increased price of the Bitcoin Network's bitcoins?
Why can't you just admit that "ponzi" is a misleading term and that a more accurate term is "highly speculative"?

Having artificially small blocks also increases fees, potentially to the level that entire use cases for bitcoin become abandoned.
There is also the issue of what you define as acceptably slow. Maybe off chain transactions speeding up a ~10 minute bitcoin transaction isn't that interesting to you because you consider 10m acceptable. However at the same time maybe you consider a 12 hour + delay due to full blocks as unacceptably slow.

If you create multiple transactions sending the same block of bitcoin's over and over, and none of those transactions are making it into the blockchain, you're not actually increasing transaction fees. 
There is a way to inflate transaction fees, but this isn't it. The amount of total bitcoin's stuck can be gamed for free, however. Whether it's currently being gamed significantly, I don't know, nor really care.
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:27:52


Stock investors do not benefit from an increase while they hold either, unless the company decides to negatively impact their balance sheet by issuing a dividend. Issuing a dividend is not a free lunch, it decreases cash on hand and affects the valuation of a company and hence the future share price. It would be like me setting up a small automatic sell on my bitcoin stash to siphon value out of its appreciation.


This is inaccurate. First of all, the value of all outstanding bitcoins is about 10B. The outstanding value of all Western Union shares is also about 10B. About $200m per day is moved through the bitcoin network. Guess what...about $200m per day is also moved through the Western Union network. Why then is bitcoin anymore of a speculative asset than western union stock?
Secondly you use the fact that it would be possible to transact a high value through the system despite a lower bitcoin price to claim excessive speculation. You could also transact a high value through the Western Union network independent of their share price. This proves nothing.


It sounds like you're arguing that the transaction demand for money is not a real effect? During an increased amount of trade the amount of money that is inaccessible at any given time because it is involved in trade goes up unless you decrease the transactional time and the time that people hold onto the money before selling it themselves. 




Why is this a problem? This is true for almost any asset. That doesn't make it a ponzi. If someone suddenly decided to sell 5% of outstanding shares in a company in addition to the normal demand the share price would collapse as well.


I could say the exact same thing about stocks. The fact that an asset has a high speculative demand doesn't make it a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2016-10-16 04:32:41
Just because a stock pays dividends doesn't mean its not a speculative investment. There are infact stocks which pay no dividends and either reinvest all their spare cash in the business, buy shares directly as buybacks, or are outright just losing money and do none of those things. Dividends are just profits distributed in a specific way and theres nothing special about them really. 
Bitcoin has profits due to the transactional demand of money in addition to its speculative component. If he was being logical then he would see that by his definition most stocks are ponzi schemes too. The profit or loss a business makes from its products is no more valid than the profit or loss a bitcoin investor makes due to the demand for bitcoins for trade.
@_date: 2016-10-16 02:57:02


How can something be 75% a ponzi game? It is either is or it isn't. Im not sure you realize but a ponzi scheme has a legal definition and you don't get convicted for running something that is 75% ponzi scheme. 
What you meant to say is that its value is 75% speculative, which is very different from saying its 75% ponzi game. Does someone pay you to be this dense?
EDIT: Ponzi schemes are not defined by the level of speculation in an asset, they are defined as being deceptive as to the source of their profits, the source of which is hidden and turns out to be from later investors. The deception required is not possible in bitcoin due to its nature as an open source network.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:20:08
And? You continue to miss the point that you dont need 100% trustlessness in order to have economic weight in bitcoin.
Infact, just running a full node gives you 0 economic weight. Full nodes have 0 power unless youre actually buying or selling bitcoins with them. If youre not mining, its your economic activity that affects your economic weight in bitcoin. Transacting trustlessly is a great perk, but it really has nothing to do with your economic weight.

A Government can manipulate its fiat currency in small degrees, but ultimately market demand "holds its value" on the larger scale and is the larger factor.

Paper wallets don't involve trusting anyone. Nor does localbitcoins really. I make localbitcoins trades at a local bank and wait for confirmation on the blockchain which I check from multiple sources. No more trust involved than a full node. Even with a full node you're trusting that at least one of the 8 nodes you've connected to isn't malicious.
Even if you want to say there's some theoretical amount of trust in that situation, it doesn't change the fact that you don't need to have a full node to have economic weight in bitcoin. Economic weight has the same economic weight even if it's not 100% trustless.

How much money does it cost to run a paypal node? The paypal analogy makes no sense because with no amount of money can you run a paypal node, 100% of the control is held by paypal. 
The point is that even if nodes became datacenter size, bitcoin could still be massively decentralized. There are hundreds of thousands of datacenters. That's more nodes than we have now anyways.

You can play word games with which chain is "valid" and which one you think is the "real bitcoin". Doesn't matter, miners do what they want. You can go to another chain or you can try to bribe them by threatening to not buy their coins. Ultimately the decision is up to them.

Are you a patent attorney? Because I am. ;) Obviously a patent entitles you to money if infringed. But the stated goal is simply to prevent someone else from patenting it, not to make money off it. Which is the point,  Timo was obviously attempting to make money off it, calling it a defensive patent is bullshit. A patent is a patent. You can offer licenses that make it harder to use the patent offensively, but even those usally have out clauses. Have they even offered it under the DPL? That's the least they could fucking do, and it appears they haven't even done that.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:58:13
The miners are different in that they are the ones actually choosing which block to extend. Non mining users have no control over the blockchain. They can only affect the price of coins, which can be used to indirectly influence miners. But miners can always choose to ignore your bribe if it's not enough to override what they wanted to do otherwise. The choice is always up to miners. Sure you can abandon that chain's miners for some other miners, but then it's just a different set of miners making the decisions.

Quadratic hashing still wouldn't be a problem with 2mb block hf. Once you get close to 8 it's an issue, but it's not as urgent as raising the blocksize is and has been for years. There are also other ways besides segwit to fix it, but I'd take segwit with extension blocks or some kind of commitment to a hf.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:20:20
The fear of high validation time 2mb blocks seems like an even lamer attack vector than segwit's attack vector which allows contrived blocks filled with useless signatures to reach double the size (would be 4mb of potential spam with segwit, while providing only 2mb useful space) of the usable limit. 
Either of thsee attacks seem to need a hashpower majority to be economically feasable, and if you had a hashpower majority there are already better attack vectors anyways...

That's the thing, their original position was always "no increase until other improvements". Segwit represents the other improvements they always wanted. Even the capacity increase that segwit gives, is only a signature data increase, which is needed for their layer 2 solutions. Segwit is simply not a compromise, it's what they wanted all along.

@_date: 2017-05-01 05:13:43


No, this quote clearly shows you don't understand wtf is going on. For segwit to go beyond 2.1mb, people would have to use more multisig p2wsh transactions, which are larger and cost more than a simple p2wpkh transaction. P2wpkh is not more "economically expensive" as you suggest than p2wsh. Also, the 2.1mb estimate is already assuming everyone uses p2wpkh and p2wsh, not p2pkh and p2sh like you said.
Again, you fail to realize that even if by switching to segwit, more people use multisig because multisig is slightly more affordable than it was before, and segwit blocks go beyond 2.1mb, you're not moving any more transactions than before, the transactions are just on average larger.

The paypal argument doesn't make any sense. For no amount of money can you run a paypal node, 100% of control is paypal's. Even if nodes are expensive, they can still be massively decentralized.

So you backtrack further and now qualify it as an *accidental* ponzi...which i guess implies there is no fraud involved, which would be required in an actual ponzi scheme as it is defined in the english language, and it is nothing more than a negative and deceitful way to say that its value is highly speculative, and which could apply to gold, stocks, or almost anything else the SEC regulates. Great work!


I dont dispute that. Your point is?


What matters is if the source of profits is set up to come only from later investors, almost always using fraud to hide this fact. If you make it absolutely clear that the source of profits is *only* from later investors and people give you money anyways its possible that a court would put you in jail for ponzi i guess. But as we know Bitcoin has sources of demand (and hence profit in the form of an appreciated asset) that do not derive only from later investors so how is this relevant?


The blame cannot be pinned on anyone in what you call "accidental ponzies", which is a nonsense phrase, because they are infact not ponzies. They are simply speculative investments. The people involved in those markets and who advertise those things as potential investments are well known. They cannot be put in jail because they're not involved in promoting an actual ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:38:45
I think bypassing corporate censorship (paypal, visa, etc) through decentralization is pretty valuable. If all the datacenters in the world were owned by one or two company that would be a problem, but they're not.
Also, I think the best way to protect bitcoin from governments is to make it so big and pervasive that no one country could have a large affect on it. If all the countries of the world effectively united against us (assuming we haven't reached enough mass adoption that public protest and the massive scale makes enforcement impossible - need low fees to reach this scale), bitcoin prices would crash regardless of if we had 1mb blocks, or 20mb blocks. In either case it'd be best to just scater and use under the radar altcoins. There would be no reason not to switch to new coins because our bitcoin holdings wouldn't be worth shit anyways. Why be so conservative with bitcoin blocksize when if the worst case scenario comes you can just switch to a new blockchain?

Well I'm glad everyone elected you to speak for them...lol. In a long enough timeline....everything goes to zero, ponzi or not.
How can something be zero sum when it creates value for end users by being a transaction network? Obviously the use of the network to transact has value independent of any speculative function.
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:04:53
nothing is ever "fully developed". there are always improvements that can be done. The fact is that fees increased enough to incentivize a significant amount of mining even in this short time, and for the most part bitcoin still works in the short term. In the long term leaving fees high for no good reason will harm growth. 
I dont think forcing wallet devs to make better fee estimation decades before it was actually needed is worth the artificial economic inefficiency. Thats the type of central planning bs that bitcoin needs to avoid.

You didn't answer my question. Would you prefer I said Blockstream is funded by a "legacy financial services business with interest in preserving the status quo"? Its hilarious that you're pushing such an irrelevant semantic argument. No one cares if you think its 'fair' to call AXA a bank. Retail banking and insurance are so intertwined it doesnt matter. They're both legacy financial system services. Making appliances like GE isn't a legacy financial system service. On the other hand, almost everything AXA does is financial services. Does AXA actually produce anything, or are they just a financial services middleman like many people want bitcoin to replace?

Thats debatable. There is still some theoretical risk, but if you can demonstrate prior art it shouldnt be a problem.

But your sacrificing user rights to blockstream, so of course it seems like no problem for you.

I don't understand why people want to cripple the massive hashpower and user base of bitcoin just so you can run a node cheaply in a third world country (when the fees are so high that this cheap node is useless anways). Just because running a node is expensive, doesn't mean bitcoin has become paypal. How much money does it take to run a paypal node? For no amount of money can you run a paypal node, that's not how it works. 
Even with node costs being nontrivial, bitcoin is still an amazing technology, and Jihan makes the point that even if a node required a datacenter to run, with enough mass adoption (and you need cheap fees for mass adoption, there's too many better options for most people than bitcoin at $2 per transaction) it can still be massively more decentralized than it is today.
If you have shit internet and insist on running a full node, why not just use an altcoin and let the bitcoin network grow to meet its full potential growth and maximize it's network effect? Bitcoin nodes were never meant to stay trivial to run.

Your handgun analogy isnt very good, because you dont need more patents and threats of further patent aggression to protect yourself from other people's patents. Well documented prior art and open licenses is fully succifient. Its like if you had a remote that could disable someone else's gun even more reliably than you would be able to shoot them yourself with your own gun. Spend your time you spent collecting extra patents instead on simply creating and documenting prior art and you're in just as good shape without contributing to perpetuating patent wars.

Well, firstly it's true, they are a bank. I don't care if you want to play semantic word games on the definition of a bank. You clearly don't understand that insurance companies are a type of bank (insurance is described in many many places as a banking service, google it), and even AXA has a traditional retail banking arm as well.
Secondly, it is infact useful to point out potential conflicts of interest so that others can decide how much weight they want to put on Blockstream's opinions on the scaling debate. Blockstream and Greg Maxwell have been some of the most vocal in preventing compromise. For example, calling everyone at the HK agreement dipshits, and getting Adam Back to change his signature, poisoning the agreement.

If you aren't interested in bitcoin becoming a major currency, and are more concerned with running a full node with 3rd world internet, just use an altcoin, there's no shame in it if low node cost is your primary concern. Jihan pointed out that even if nodes became so big that they took a datacenter...there are enough datacenters around to provide even more decentralization than we do now. But we'll never even get close to that level of adoption with $2 fees per transaction.

I think you've lost track of what we're talking about. I said that LN was used as an excuse to prevent a HF blocksize increase at the time. Doesn't matter if theoretically you think a HF might be needed *one day* in the future, it was used to block it at that time by downplaying the capacity need because LN was imminent and would lessen the load. You saying that they support segwit so they support a capacity increase doesn't change the fact that they were blocking a capacity increase before segwit even existed, and still use the existance of LN to downplay thr need for onchain scaling beyond segwit's one time acounting trick. Yet years later LN can only handle 20,000 people.

Using an spv wallet like mycelium or electrum with an unrelated block explorer or two to check things gives you a hell of alot more control and decentralization than paypal does. 
And if you have an edge case where you truely feel the need for a cheap full node, why not just use an altcoin? I feel like bitcoin should maximize user adoption since special cases can always employ an altcoin instead. First mover advantage and potential mass adoption seem like Bitcoin's advantage over alts that we should pursue.

I'm sure there was some kind of boost from the reduction in market uncertainty when the lock in was reached, but I can guarantee you it was not an extra 400%.

This is simply not true. The license itself determines what rights you are granted whether or not you accept the license. For example, GPL v3 states that you have the right to use and propagate the work even without acceptance of the license (they do require acceptance to modify it, but other licenses do not have to require this):


A license simply grants rights to the holder in a standardized form which has been designed to protect those rights in a courtroom.
Edit: 


You must not have looked very hard then, because GPL V3 provides a patent license that, while it requires acceptance for modification, requires no acceptance for use and distribution. Its certainly an upgrade to the rights to users than that afforded by the DPL. Relevant section of GPL:

It depends on what the patent covered exactly. It could be technology to make blocks smaller and more efficient, and then they could go after anyone propogating such blocks. Obviously it would be most profitable to go after large, publicly known miners in a case like that.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:34:25
Theres no such thing as a "Defensive patents", a patent is a patent. You can issue licenses for that patent that make it harder to use that patent offensively, but the DPL v1.1 used leaves some wiggle room for offensive use, futhermore, the license offering can be revoked within 180 days, and if you did not take specific action to recieve a license before that time, youre screwed.

The only way you could reach 200m tps, is if each person using LN was sending 10,000 tps each, because you're limited to about 20,000 people using it. The amount of people/nodes it can support is a bottleneck that makes your theoretical massive tps unrealistic.

Security is only useful up to a cetain point and then its just wasted effort and pointless sacrifices. We're debating at what point that line is. If security trumps all, all the time, then even LukeJr's idea to reduce blocksize to less than 300MB is not enough.
 Do you think blocksize should be less than 300kb?
 How many nodes do we need to have enough security? In any case, I'd argue that the nodes we'll gain from having more bitcoiners attracted to lower fees, would cancel out any that we'd lose who have dialup internet and can't run a full node with 4mb blocks.

You're missing the point that miners are part of the economy and can provide demand for coins themselves which creates value. Non-mining nodes aren't needed to create demand. The non ming nodes can ADD to the demand but it's not 0 without them.
Again, all a node can do is affect value of coins, but how a miner responds to that effect is purely up to them. They can simply ignore you if they want and continue to mine as they please, perhaps because of ideological differences, perhaps because they are more concerned with the long term effects of the changes than your short term demand effects. Do you disagree?

The miners are currently content with a 1 mb limit. Try sending a segwit transaction on the Bitcoin network and see how that goes. Ultimately the miners are in charge of this blockchain.

A hard fork doesn't force anything. You can stay on the old chain if you prefer. But no rational group would inititate a hard fork without consensus because theres too much risk. Better to have the nodes make an explicit choice than to turn them into zombie nodes with a soft fork. This hardfork phobia is so naive. It's like you think hardforks have ruined all the blockchains that have used them. Look around. Hardforks are how blockchains have always meant to be upgraded.

Alot of people opposed to Core's proposed softfork segwit implementation would actually support it if it were done as a hardfork. 
Segwit is more naturally and elegantly implemented as a hardfork and the fact that it has been forced into a hacky softfork is seen as being done in order to "trick" nodes that have not upgraded (either because they're lazy or because they do not agree with the proposed changes) into accepting the changes anyways. 
Some people think that Core's love of softforks and fear of hardforks is nothing more than a selfserving position which allows them to force their changes on nodes without having to convince the nodes to upgrade to their new version. Hardforks give the user the ability to choose and the fact that many devs want to take away that ability or make it seem dangerous is seen as a red flag.

You're right, most types of propagation are restricted as well in GPL3. The difference is that in GLP3 is **acceptance of the license is already assumed by anyone doing modification or propogation**:


However in DPL v1.1, you have to take specific action to accept the license. notice 'state affirmatively' - thats intentional to restrict the license :


In other words, the GLP3 requires no action to be accepted, while the DPL does. So while you could contrue all licenses as having to be accepted in one form or another - debatable - the reality is that you can make acceptance automatic so its not a real issue.


You can see that this claim doesnt have much of a point to it when you see that acceptance can be assumed and happens automatically.

If you look at it in terms of coins per day that need to be bought to keep up with miner production, to go from $100 per coin to $500 per coin and 3600 coins per day, required an extra 1.4m per day. to go from $1000 per coin to $5000 per coin at 1800 coins per day still requires an extra $7.2m per day even with half the coins being mined.

This has nothing do with a "vision of the future". This is a theoretical discussion about who has control of the blockchain. Value in an open market isn't determined by a "small board of people" it's determined by anyone that wishes to pay for it, regardless of if there are only a few people willing to pay for it, anyone has the option to do so if they chose. I'm pointing out that non-mining nodes hold no special power that mining nodes don't have. There can theoretically be a self contained economy of only mining nodes producing and trading coins amongst eachother, no non-mining nodes involved at all, and it would work just fine. The coin prices would be lower certainly, but how high or low the price of bitcoin is has no effect on its use as a direct medium of exchange. 
Non mining can try to influence mining nodes with economic incentives, but ultimately the final decision which blocks are extended and what rules they follow comes down to miners.
You don't control someone just because you have the ability to offer them money to influence their decisions. They can always refuse. For example, just because I could offer a PETA member a job for 150k tasting and reviewing rare meats and fur coats, doesn't mean I control that person. They are likely to refuse. Even if they accept for a short time they could leave the job whenever they wanted.

If segwit activates nodes that don't upgrade can't even verify the segwit transactions. Not much of a "consensus" if you never had a choice and can't even verify what's going on. Any advantage softforks have over hardforks in maintaining "consensus" is an illusion, especially when you need a UASF to do it. Just because old nodes are *somewhat* forwards compatible with your changes doesn't mean you aren't "breaking consensus". What does that even mean anyways? Is the phrase "breaking consensus" just supposed to be some derogatory description of a hard fork?

Really? You forget that small blockers were blocking a 2mb increase years ago before segwit was even a thing?

Is the pledge actually legally binding? There arent even any signatures on the pledge as to who's making the pledge. New ownership could claim the old management has no right to limit their patent rights with such a pledge. They could at anytime delete the pledge and claim it no longer applies because circumstances have changed.
Licenses are legally binding, but the DPL v1.1 they use only applies if you specifically request a license, and only if any patents you hold are also DPL licensed. Lastly, giving the inventors a transferable license with an IPA sounds good, until you realize that in many cases, the inventors are likely Greg and Adam themselves, so that doesnt help anyone who is worried about the inventors themselves enforcing the patent. 
A GPL license would absolve us from having to trust blockstream's 'pledge', but then they wouldnt have any ammo for patent disputes, which they feel like they need, and apparently feel is worth witholding public transferable licenses from the community.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:40:58


I don't care if the holder makes money in this case. The person trying to frivilously patent the idea that has prior art is going to lose a lot of legal fees trying to pursue the issue. Thats enough of a deterent, and doesnt perpetuate bullshit software patent wars.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:30:06
Segwit isnt a hardfork.
Permissionless access can be maintained with more expensive nodes. The higher fees have already excluded access to the third world anways, so your solution of crippling blocksize isn't a good one in any way.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:53:51
The point of running in a datacenter is that they already have the bandwidth connectivity available, and it doesn't cost them much to reserve some of that for a full node. In a world where that bitcoin adoption is so high that datacenter nodes are required, there will be thousands of companies that require a full node for their business purposes.

How will one channel facilitate millions of people trustlessly? If you have millions of people on one channel it's just an internal database, no need for a blockchain. The highest usage people are using 2nd layer solutions already. They have private channels between eachother.
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:24:44
Yea and segwit plus a 2mb increase in maxblocksize would quadruple growth and prove that we can increase again in the future if needed. Segwit can only ever be done once.
How exactly does segwit make a hard fork 'safer'?
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:46:52
If you increase your fee, youre just causing someone else's transaction to be stuck instead of yours, because you outbid them. Increasing fees does not allow us to transfer more than 1mb of transactions per 10 mins. The total amount of delayed transactions isn't changed.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:44:00
This is bullshit, with 2mb HF + segwit it'd be 4mb, not 8mb. 8mb is only possible with contrived spam transactions, and there are more effective ways to attack the network than sending transactions with useless signature spam. Even Nullc has said this is a frivolous argument you're presenting.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:08:22


A 2mb hardfork was ready and tested even before segwit. Why do you think Segwit is the default answer simply because it exists?

Great advice...as long as you don't care that you're poisoning software development for years to come with more bullshit software patents. Which is most people unfortunately. Tragedy of the commons.
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:11:45
If they end up in blocks they're not maximizing the amount of bitcoin's stuck in unconfirmed transactions, are they? 2 different games you're thinking of here. One has real consequences, the other doesnt. 
Increasing transaction fees would generally involve you paying alot of transaction fees and be expensive. To increase the amount of stuck bitcoin's you could just use a fee low enough that it won't ever confirm and it's free.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:50:27
Some might. But most rational miners will instead choose to mine a chain they feel is less likely to POW change. Your segwit coin's hashpower will be a fraction of what it was presegwit.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:37:48
LOL segwit already had the extra witness data in it when they made that agreement. The agreement explicitly included an aditional increase to 2mb of non-witness data, which is in addition to what segwit offers. The agreement said that the miners would run Core software, which they did. It didn't say they couldn't signal support for other options while they were continueing to run Core software.

This has nothing to do with the LN whitepaper. I'm talking specifically about justifications that were being thrown around years ago to block a maxblocksize increase. The imminancy of LN was one of those. Yet here we are years later and it can only support 20,000 people.

Even if we dropped blocksize to 300kb, how many extra people would be running nodes, and how much utility would bitcoin gain from those extra nodes? We'd be moving a third of the transactions. Do you think we'd have 3 times as much "security"? Most people don't choose to not run nodes because its expensive, they don't run nodes because they have no need to. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:13:14
Um, it seems like you don't realize that in exchange for activating segwit, the litecoin miners asked for HF blocksize increase when blocks reach half full. Basically the litecoin devs are actually reasonable people, gotta give them props.

All the evidence I need is Luke JR's reddit posts on the issue. He has posted several times in the past that he likes UASF, but doesn't want to be seen as supporting it, because it looks better if it looks like users are pushing it instead of devs. That's the definition of astroturfing, curating your actions to make something look more grassroots than it is.
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:31:04


Fully attributable to segwit? So you think that without segwit litecoin would have remained stable in price, even though every single major altcoin has risen similar amounts as litecoin over the same period? Those other altcoins don't have the segwit factor and have risen just as much. Hmm, ok then. 
Seems to me that segwit has had little to no effect on litecoin's price. ALL the alts have been going up in unison.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:55:10
Again, you're just claiming that there is some trust involved somewhere if you aren't running a full node yourself. Still irrelevant to whether you have economic weight or not.
If I send money to poloniox and buy ETC  there, I'm applying economic weight to ETC. Just because you think there is some chance that the exchange screws me over and follows a different chain than they claimed doesn't mean that I cant apply economic weight to the ETC chain without a full node, it just means there's a possibility that I could get screwed over. Having some chance of being screwed over doesn't mean you don't have economic weight. Even if you run a full node, the government could come arrest you for some unrelated reason and lock you in a cage for the rest of your life. Just because there's some possibility of that happening, does that mean you have no economic weight? It only removes your economic weight if it actually happens. You cant just assume you get screwed over every time without a full node and therefore have no economic weight. That's nonsense, and dosent reflect reality.
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:29:59
If they did that, why not just switch to an altcoin? At that point coin price and user adoption aren't important anyways (price would be decimated by being forced underground), so switching to an altcoin with better privacy features wouldn't have much downside.
Besides, if you assume overbearing worldwide government control, this global government could just filter or cut off your Internet access entirely and make bitcoin unfeasible on a large scale anyways.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:11:19

I'm not sure that poll is a good representation. For example, Coinbase seemed pretty open to non-core options, but after some blockstream/theymos assisted PR attacks, they don't seem willing to publicly support anything but Core. I'm sure other companies feel the same way.
Also, I think you underestimate Core's "stickyness". It's hard to get people to switch to a new dev team, even if Core doesn't well represent their ideal. It's like saying if people don't like Comcast they'll quickly abandon them...there's not alot of viable alternatives. It takes alot of time and manpower to create an alternative with equal trust.

Doesn't matter, they'll have the longest chain. You'd have to be content on a minority chain and take precautions in case they use their hashpower to disrupt your new chain. You might even have to change POW. Now you're on a new blockchain. The miners still control chain they were hashing all along.

Exactly, the GPL is a fully transferable public license, while this DPL license is non-transferrable and to receive the license you must specifically request it. Blockstream is only allowing non-transferrable licenses so that they can use the patents in future theoretical patent wars.

The lines between banks an insurance companies are blurred. The largest banks, such as AXA are also insurance companies (insurance companies do lending as well), and asset management companies. See:  Why are you fixed on the word 'bank'? fascinating. no one cares if you want to call AXA a bank or an insurance company, or an asset management company, or a multinational financial serves firm.
Do you realize that when people say 'big banks' these are the types of companies theyre refering to? "big banks" is not a scientific term, rofl. Its hilarious that you want to split hairs over the definition of a colloquial phrase. The fact that you feel the need to is damning in itself.

I can understand your desire to create the appearance of such a distinction, more effective for astroturfing. How much technical assistance do you provide BU? I asked you at the time if you'd review BU code too, and you said something like "maybe if they stop trying to attack the network". It's clear you only provide technical assistance if you support the idea politically, or perhaps if you're neutral and getting paid. Theres nothing wrong with that, it's pretending it isn't true which is the issue.

Oh my god! The irony here is so thick. You are completely confused and you project your confusion onto me. I don't think you even understand p2pkh, p2sh, p2wpkh, and p2wsh. Let me explain:
P2sh refers to current multisig transactions. P2pkh refers to current standard transactions. The 2.1mb estimate is based on the throughput if EVERYONE used segwit with the current mix of multisig and normal transactions, which in segwit are accomplished through p2wsh and p2wpkh.
Yes segwit makes multisig transactions cheaper than they were, but even with segwit multisig transactions (p2wsh) are still larger and more expensive to send than a simple nonmultisig segwit transaction (p2wpkh) sent to one address. People are not going to start sending only multisig transactions because most people have no reason to. You're comments about "people using the method that costs more fees" shows that you have no understanding of this point. Again, multisig costs more fees, even after segwit. Do you understand? 
Even if multisig is super trendy and people start using it all the time for no good reason, you've only encouraged people to make larger, more complicated transactions. You're not increasing the actual number of transactions that can be sent beyond an extra 1.1mb worth of today's transactions.
It's remarkable that you sit here and rage at me for quoting 2.1mb when thats already a generous estimate from pro-segwit sources. Earlier estimates were 1.7mb. Jesus Christ man.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:32:17
Lol, I don't know who you're trying to fool with these games. Keep pretending that insurance isn't a form of banking. The word "bank" is not even important. People say in bitcoin say "bank" because its shorter than saying "legacy financial services business with interest in preserving the status quo". It's funny that you think that by splitting hairs over the word bank and trying to restrict the definition to apply only to traditional retail banking, you think you can distract from the fact that they're one of these aforementioned "legacy financial services business with interest in preserving the status quo". You like that term better?

Blockstream blocked the 2mb proposals that would have been in Core code. Core never allowed for a hashpower vote like they allowed segwit. So they had to make their own competing client, but bitcoin has depended on Core for so long it takes alot for them to lose that captive market. Not even Jihan strayed from Core then. Core was too powerful of a centralizing effect. Community never had a choice on 2mb blocks unless they wanted to abandon Core, which is an unrelated matter.

Lol, again, this is a totally different attack. If you had a group of miners conspiring to raise fees, I wonder why they wouldn't just not mine transactions with fees below a certain level, rather than make fake transactions which could lead them to paying fees to other miners. Not sure how they'd have to structure that for it to actually be profitable for them, in theory it'd be possible I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:27:25
Your plan excludes people with high fees. At least by making fees cheap, you attract more people and have a chance of replacing the nodes with dial up internet we might lose, with new bitcoiners that actually have a reasonable internet connection.
Either way you're excluding people, so you don't have a good argument there.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:52:12

I applaud the mental gymnastics needed to say that by raising an arbitrarily placed limit that was always meant to be raised, the fees will now be "artificially low". By raising the limit the fees become closer to the true market price determined by the miners including the transactions.
Node operators are not providing "charity" for these extra people that will be able to transact with the extra block space. Do you not understand that having more people able to use bitcoin for more things leads to an increase in the price of bitcoin? Perhaps this isn't important if the node owner does not own any bitcoin, but then I would have to wonder why the person is running a full node if they don't own bitcoin?
Lastly, I love the idea of LN and other 2nd layers. I love the concept of having a choicr between main chain and second layer. AND for precisely that reason I don't accept being FORCED onto 2nd layers because the primary layer is constrained to a rediculously small level and is not allowed to grow with bandwidth, computing power, and availability of storage, all of which continue to grow exponentially while max blocksize is stagnant. 
Onchain scaling and offchain scaling are not mutually exclusive so it's rediculous to me that we didn't hardfork to 2mb years ago while we were waiting for segwit. Now the people pushing segwit blame US for being obstructionist when it was them that started the stalemate by refusing to increase years ago. I don't particularly care for segwit, yet I'm willing to activate it as long as we get a nonwitness data increase beyond segwit, whether by HF or by extension blocks. 
Who is it that seems more reasonable and willing to compromise? Those who demand segwit unconditionally as the only solution, or those who think Segwit is insufficient, but are willing to give you segwit as long as you allow something beyond just segwit, and offer you multiple options such a HF blocksize increase, a dynamic blocksize like BU, or even extension blocks as options. Almost everyone agrees more capacity beyond segwit is needed in the future, just go ahead and do it now even if you think it will be temporarily excessive. Even if you think it's a bit too much at the moment, technology will quickly make 4mb look like 2mb does today so why make such a big deal about it?

You think one node can serve millions, but if those millions of people are limited to routing their transaction through one node, then it's not decentralized at all. Infact, why not just use an SPV node at that point?
