If a woman sleeps with a politician for political favors, is she not exercising her right to declare her support for him?  Why don’t we allow sexual favors for policy change?
Vague “support” is not speech. Speech confers concrete ideas. Money is as abstract as it gets.
Money is so abstract that it is exchangeable for nearly *anything* you can think of.  If that doesn’t seem like a poor way to design a system then you don’t know much about system design.

So you’d rather them be able to fuck us with no limits as long as you know who is doing the fucking?  I fail to see how that’s better.
The entire problem is that corporations have undue influence due to money.  The problem isn’t that we don’t know where the money is coming from, the problem is it’s there in the first place.
And I would love for you to explain how money is speech.  I’m sure political bribery is not what early Americans had in mind when they wrote the first amendment.

As if population or immigration are anywhere *near* our biggest problems.
Our biggest problems are money in politics, an archaic voting system, and an anti-intellectual culture.  Fix those and 90% of our problems go away.

How is that any better than what we have now?  Unlimited direct donations just means that money has disproportionate influence on our political system, giving the rich undue influence. It’s disenfranchisement of the lower and middle classes.
