I think the fixed cost is more in the .15-.20 range.

I am Jeff Gross, the owner of btcVacations.
The site was thrown up to gauge the demand for a bitcoin only full-service travel agency.  It was never meant as a final site.
November was a very successful first month for us booking multiple cruises, hotel rooms and airfare.
I am in the process of configuring a dynamic travel agency site for btcVacations.  Once I have it like I want it the URL will be redirected.  My email and phone number are clearly visible on this site:  btcvacations.agentstudio.com
We have the ability to book services with all of the travel partners listed on the site.  I have agency logins to all of the sites listed.  Asking them who we are would not be a good way to verify.  Each of these companies work with tens of thousands of agencies and independent agents and probably do not know who 99% of them are. 
If you have any further questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

Chrystov is not associated with btcVacations.  Hopefully, they are a happy customer that wants to spread the word.
The emailmeform serve to collect information.  For simple bookings, we can book directly from there and send a bitcoin invoice.
With most of our bookings, the emailmeform served to collect initial information and there was additional communication before a booking was made.
In one case, a client thought a certain category of cruise room came with certain amenities based on the cruiseline's site.  We were able to correct his misunderstanding and find a more suitable choice.  With a fully automated system, he would have made the booking and been very disappointed later.  We also had a request for a booking through expedia.  We knew that hotels.com was having a stay 2 nights get 1 free so we were able to save the client a little money.
One of our greatest strengths is that we have nearly 100 travel partners and can book most any vacation in bitcoin.  However to build a fully automated system that allows us to book all of this is not feasible.

Yes, it has been posted several times before but I'll go ahead and answer.
Sign up with coinbase or bitpay.  They will instantly convert the BTC to $.  Your customer send the BTC to them and you receive $ in your bank account.
Coinbase charges no fees on the first $1,000,000.  I've been doing business with Coinbase since October and have been happy with them.
