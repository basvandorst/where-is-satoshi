Segwit is not controversial? What am I missing? Please explain?  
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:56:36
Yep, That's the problem. /s

Anyone with a sound rebuttal to this response? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:53:52
Does not fix quadratic hash scaling for legacy transactions!
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:43:57
The only way to "get-rich-quick" with BU. Is when BU gets adopted and the Bitcoin price skyrockets.

They are waiting for a miner 70% miner support and then a month or two waiting period before activating the HF.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:18:46
I agree with everything except for your conclusion.
Here why:
If segwit gets implemented, new transactions will have an "anyone can spend" address associated with them. This will create a bigger headache when attempting a straight bigger blocks hardfork. Plus segwit doesn't fix the quadratic hash scalling problem of legacy transactions.

Consensus that emerges out of the unknown -&gt; Emergent consensus.
This is precisely what Bitcoin is going through now! 
Segwit vs No Segwit!
BU vs No BU!

If everything was hunky-dory in Bitcoin land why the debate be so vicious? SegWit has serious issues that's not BU fault.

@_date: 2017-03-13 07:15:49
Clearly BU has an issue marketing itself!
The whole reason BU exists is to fix the the go..darn block size thingy. Everything else is still on the table, yes including SegWit.
BTW, I am glad we can have this debate here.

So we have a choice?

They are rejecting Segwit as its stands, and not BU!

Or Donald J. Trump
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:21:48
They rejecting SegWit as a SoftFork. They are not rejecting individual Core contributors!
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:24:00
The scaling issue has moved from a technical discussion, it is now **political**. Better communication needs to happen on both sides of the debate.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:35:58
What difference does a soft limit make?
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:08:23
Who thinks this is a better reply?

How did it survive for 5 five years, without reaching the various lower limits put in place. 
(PS: I did read the article)
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:23:59
Please have a look at this post.
It describes how you can navigate a BU hardfork successfully.
Essential, everyone can still run the miner and/or node they want.
 
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:17:57
The honesty here is refreshing. Most miners are also totally peeved at the lack of commitment from core to increase to block size. That is why not only has signaling for SegWit stopped but their acceptance of BU is increasing.
Miners, rightly, want their investments protected, and they are a critical part of the bitcoin ecosystem. Why is this  community intent of driving them in to the arms of BU?   
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:29:33
Why did this mining pool malleate the transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:40:49
Garbage the Complete Article!
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:34:28
The key point about BU support of segwit is they would prefer it to be done as a hardfork after the adoption of a block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:35:01
There will be inflation till 2140.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:27:27
RBF maybe (big maybe) useful when blocks are empty. But completely useless when blocks are full. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:12:59
And, the limited was raised each time. And each time Bitcoin performed perfectly adequately. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:58:35
That clears that up. The silence on the "hot" page is deafening regarding the SW vs BU debate.
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:56:37
They don't need to do anything. It's already happening. Bitcoin is losing **market share** and **price**.
The ball is in Core's court, all the market wants is a true blocksize increase^*. 
^* The market has rejected SegWit as a blocksize increase. Everyone has their own reasons but here are a few.
* Because only 1.7 effective increase.
* The lightening network is not ready. 
* Lots of changes to critical code. (the Technically Debt argument) 
* Miners will loose on chain fees.
* No way ever to Hardfork without contention.
* The "everyone spend transactions" in  the main chain means we can't undo SegWit.
  
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:42:29
Reasonable volatility is a good thing. The biggest issues are transaction fees and delayed confirmations.
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:53:48
Johnny a core developer debating with Rodger confirm the only reason core is blocking a Hard fork is because they regard it as a "moral hazard". They are butt naked!  
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:45:09
Both core and BU supporters want bitcoin to succeed, yes that includes  MASSIVE off change scaling. But as it stands segwit does not provide enough headroom to accommodate the **current** scaling issues. 
Remember both core and BU code is open source so the communities are open to use what is best in both teams. In fact the idea (not sure about code) of compact blocks was developed by the BU team.
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:08:04
From what I hear most BU supporters support layer 2 solutions as well. They also would approve fixing malleability either via SegWit or FlexiTrans. And development could be alot more rapid because we cross the block size Rubicon.  
(edit language)
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:46:03
Ah, but the new transaction outputs are marked as **anyone can spend**. And it **can** and will be spent by anyone on the original chain.

You got some good points. But remember BU didn't just start from zero. And as you might have guessed it is a "political" issue rather than "technical" one.

Number 3. There is a chance of losing funds if your transaction claiming   funds is not accepted before a the expiry of the channel.

A core developer or two have stated that they don't want to increase the block size via hard fork because it will create a "Moral Hazard".
