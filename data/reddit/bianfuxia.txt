Who shames other people for going about their day differently than they would? 
I am all for reducing waste, but the bitcoin subreddit isn’t the place to do it. If this sub had its way countless paper and metal currencies across the world would stop being produced and used which would be amazing for the environment.
Additionally I just tweeted out two different things pertaining to environmental protection this morning,
While plastic straws are a menace to the environment, ghost fishing nets (ones cut off and left to drift) kill more sea turtles and other creatures as well.
Perhaps direct yourself to a commercial fishing subreddit or something.
This guys one straw isn’t hurting anybody especially if he properly recycles it.
Additionally, Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffees don’t have lids with anyway to drink them without straws if you need to take them to go, so you should direct your anger at the company that isn’t providing an environmentally friendly way to drink their product as opposed to the consumer of that product.

LOL manny people who ask for money from friends do pay then back. In fact when I get loaned money from my friends (which is often) I pay them back within the week and I give them more than they loaned me. If someone who is your 'friend' is lying to you to take advantage of you they weren't you're friend to begin with. The advantage of loans from friends is just that: the friendly nature of the loan that takes way less time and work to figure out then a loan from somewhere else.
