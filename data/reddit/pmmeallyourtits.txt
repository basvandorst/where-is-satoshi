If you go on show all on coinmarketcap you can see a 7day chart and an hourly chart added to the daily. I don‘t if that helps.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:56:04
Come on stop that ignorant stuff. All we know is that bitcoin is the stronngest and safest currency at the moment. If a currency comes up that can handle the spotlight like bitcoin does with all the hacking attacks then fine, let the flippening happen. Bitcoin will live on but we‘ll have a new king.
But that didn‘t happen until now. As long as that‘s the case please keep those stupid comments for yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:19:57
Wtf that‘s only day 8? It seems like Imve seen day 2 a month ago or so. Time acts weird since I‘m into crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:48:59
Anything happened?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:42:24
Isn‘t that normal? Transactions always show up instantly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:53:06
Is this seriously already on south park?

This is one of the first memes in a long time that really made me laugh. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:16:32
It‘s how we work
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:50:39
Now the second sentence makes sense. I thought it had something to do with LN but I though it was too parts.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:28:19
Is LN still in testbet or can it actually be used now?
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:59:23
I‘m a bit confused about lightning. You said you opened a channel. Are you now only connected to the website or are you in this mesh network where everyone is connected to everyone?
Also, did you still have to make a normal transaction to be able to use the channel?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:35:16
Fucking segwit man
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:49:27
As if anybody would answer from support...
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:00:16
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:45:18
I‘m confused. Why are we having 2MB blocks? I thought segwit allows more txs in one block.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:58:04
Exa comes after peta right?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:52:01
What will be soon enough? Because I was asking about the users.
What do you mean with 3.5B+ zap?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:06:07
I‘d recommend not to sell now. You won‘t have your money in the next few days because everyone is cashing out now and if you are trying to use coinbase.com you‘ll have an even worse time because most people have problems withdrawing money from there.
Try it when the market is a bit more normal. You‘ll only get even more stressed at this point because selling it could turn out a bit more complicated because you don‘t understand it, which is ok tbh.
Edit: Sorry for your husband. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:24:29
I‘m talking about people saying that bitcoin will die because it won‘t keep up with the new technologies out there.
Sorry but I feel a bit attacked by this comment. I just asked for your opinion on this situation and you start assuming I‘m some kind of moon kid.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:47:51
Be smart with computers.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:36:59
You think so? I‘m bullish on bitcoin but it still concerns me that it‘ll take a long time.
Why sou think that it doesn‘t matter?
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:31:28
No it‘s not. It‘s a good meme as long as it‘s funny. Trying to put rules on something like this is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:44:29
The problem is that people who are new to crypto don‘t know that there is a thing called segwit. Coinbase is the number one place for all the new people to buy crypto. Someone who wants to spam the notwork that way would need an enormous amount of money but unedicated people in great masses do that without even knowing it.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:48:55
Doug polk just said that satoshi didn‘t want segwit in bitcoin. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:27:06
I think it doesn‘t. I‘d just find it weird if he actually said that. Maybe he just never said anything about segwit hence he doesn‘t want it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:02:10
Ok then let‘s just say that I really laughed at this one because it seemed funny to me. I haven‘t seen it in a while and to be honest I forgot about the thing with the joke. Just seeing it again and imagining rick in front of his PC buying bitcoin all happy and a few days later this scene...I‘m sorry but that‘s just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:10:41
I‘m in the red numbers but it‘s nice to see corrections and supports. I‘m confident that it will rise but the longer it stays on this level the better.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:54:36
Wouldn‘t it be a solution to just not accept high transaction fee and do every transaction one after another? I mean transactions are pretty much instant. The problem is the confirmation that the transaction is actually fixed.
Isn‘t the big problem at the moment that people who pay bigger transaction fees get in front of other transactions waiting? Is it not possible to just stop that. I mean we don‘t need transactionfees at the moment. At least there are still 12.5 BTC created every 10 minutes.
In 2140 something yes we‘ll need transaction fees because no more coins will be created. But at the moment it‘s just greedy to make the transactions with bigger tx fee before the others.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:11:27
So why would he cash out the 100K if he could have 400K in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:50:19
How long was that? Two weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:19:46
Do you seriously get the forked coins too? Isn‘t there something preventing you from doublespending? I always thought that you can only spend one of the currencies. If you spend the Bcash then your bitcoin is gone. Am I wrong here?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:14:46
Who got hacked? Never seen anything about that
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:48
Why is it fucking the altcoins? Their all in the red numbers now but I think it‘s just because of the fast rise.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:06:15
Can someone ELI5 this future thing that will come up tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:30:51
Ok. Yes fees have to be. But it could be lower than right now. I‘d be ok with $5 or so. But that‘s just too much.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:51:53

I think the price would bounce back up again. I‘d buy a whole one at least.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:35
God I hate facts. The internet bubble was bigger thought right? Some 5 trillion all together? We are at 0.6 trillion. You think it‘s going to take a while until this one pops?
I‘ve really been thinking about all that lately. How do we find out how much worth something actually has? I mean it is a bubble but on the other hand we‘re talking about currency. Limited currency that can‘t be printed. So this could very well be just the beginning and just as much it could be the end.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:55:20
Isn‘t that just the market cap?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:22:17
I understand. This tutorial doesn‘t help me though. I don‘t know how any normal person can follow this. It‘s really unclear what he does and what it is. I think I‘ll just hope that I get the airdrop from binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:19:26
Is this drop happening because one of those?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:19
If you spend 0.25 BTC then you don‘t have 0.25 BCH anymore. You meant it that way or do you really think that people from before the fork can both sell their coins as BTC and BCH at the same time?!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:51:53
What? Why did you sell it as bitcoin cash? As I understood it you can either use it as bitcoin or bitcoin cash but not as both. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:17
They didn‘t. People are still people and they are the problem in this. Hackers don‘t need to find passwords and stuff like that. They have to trick the people working in those places. People are stupid and they always will be.
That‘s why exchanges will never be safe unless they are completely code and nothing else. Everything has to be automated and bulletproof
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:41:36
What‘s the deal about him? He talks about bitcoin? I don‘t want to bash him I just thought that a lot of people do.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:31:59
What do you mean with airdrop? You receive the amount of the forked currency as you already have on the unforked currency?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:10:24
Where you know that from? Any sources?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:15
Fucking asses
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:29:45
Both claim the same things from one antoher. 
Banks corrupting the devs.
The sub is censored.
How do we find out who says the truth?
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:33:10
You are right!
I just recently got to grasp how this all works and found out why bitcoin cash is still where it is today. Because of r/bitcoin and other crypto subs I always thought that those are some greedy guys who just want to be bitcoin famous and then there roger ver which really doesn't help (fuck that guy, I really don't like him) but bitcoin cash is right about being closer to what bitcoin is supposed to be. They got mobbed out because some guy hijacked the sub and bitcointalk. 
Bitcoin cash isn't as stupid as it's being shown as here and in other places. I don't think it'll go anywhere.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:37:09
What places?
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:36:04
Is there a new place where that happens?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:18
Really? Can't you buy in the US?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:34:20
I have no idea how it works if you buy it from someone else. But I guess there are just people selling coins at a price and you can buy from them. If someone sells 5 BTC doesn't mean you have to buy 5 from him. You can also buy 0.005.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:03
It's about usd
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:28:28
It was my first transaction so I maybe did something wrong. Couldn't think what that would be though. Exodus is a local wallet but it shouldn't be a problem because I had internet connection and no problems at all.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:19
There is no update button or anything like that. The ID stays the same when I close and open again right? I know it's a stupid question. Just to be sure.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:24:14
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:30:18
Is it right that if someone bought 1 million bit coins he would have to buy them FROM someone?
It would just mean that the worth of bitcoin would just rise because someone like gave the whole thing more worth with giving it so much money?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:19
Nice. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:30:42
If you have Bitcoin on Coinbase, it's online right? I have Exodus at the moment and it's on my local computer. Is that practically the same as a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:33:19
And you can't buy anything on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:22:04
I just bought my first bitcoins an hour ago. I'm ecstatic.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:51
Try bitpanda
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:39:34
But if the number changes, how does the wallet know that the bitcoin belongs to me?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:57:02
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:33:07
Perfect. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:58:21
I know it's fishy
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:03:57
Got it. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:43
How do I do it? When I downloaded the wallet and didn't have any BTC on it it only said that I had to send money to the wallet so the backup process can be started. Or is it in the wallet section?
Also, is the private key generate through the password and those twelve words? Like a hash generator?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:14:36
Where are you?
@_date: 2018-11-17 11:17:41
Is this all from mainnet? When did it change? When I last heard about it a few months agonit was still on testnet.
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:33:53
Lol what?
Is that a quote from somewhere?
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:15:34
Isn't bitcoin cash forking today?
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:18:55
I know about all that. I'm sorry in case I sounded like an absolute layman with that question. But I appreciate the effort :)
What if a whole nation or multiple nations decides that all bitcoin transactions must be blocked by ISPs. Would that be possible? I'm actually not quite sure because of the vast amount of regular traffic that goes theough ISP every second. Would they be able to specifically scan for bitcoin transactions and not let them through without slowing down all the other traffic?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:03:41
Oh you're right!
I don't know how I couldn't think of that. The only way they could do what I just explained is to block everything and only let through stuff that they know.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:56:22
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:55:38
On mainnet?
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:25:03
Ok but if we get to the point where we live in a similar to chinese government we'll have to worry about other things than bitcoin I assume. Good to know that it would still work though.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:04:05
What happened to r/bitcoin?!
Since when are comments like this on top? Inwasbonly gone for a few weeks.
I‘m not saying that it‘s a bad thing. I just remember r/bitcoin differently.
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:51:47
How would you get reported? I don't think the police would care enough to track down your IP if you did something like this.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:57:44
I did not know about that. But if they are flooding transaction you can still get a full block.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:40:24

That's not what it's about in my post

You can't. What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:33:47
You should look into the other post I linked. Also he acually just explained the problem and you don't seem to understand. Stop calling people newbies if you don't know exactly what you're talking about either...
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:36:19
It's broadcasting to everyone who is mining. Not sure how it finds the miners though.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:03:39

I bet there's a simple explaination to this.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:07:59
Spend which inputs?
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:34:36
Makes sense. They aren't spent yet but could be seen as an attempt to double spend.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:37:40
Why you think it doesn't happen? It definitely happens, just not in malicious way. Double spending is very helpful with a stuck transaction. It's only a big problem if a double spend is inside a block. That shouldn't happen and gladly (almost?) never happened.
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:10:12
Such an irrelevant point.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:05:42
Lol. I mean seriously...
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:00:01
But that claim is in the waiting list for miners right? So it will go through sooner or later. What could come in it's way? I'm no pro, seriously asking
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:47:44
That is very true
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:35:00
BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS ARE INSTANT. CONFIRMATION IS WHAT TAKES TIME. Spread the word.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:52:20
Can you explain what you mean with that?
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:15:30
He's not wrong
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:14:46
Shit. Yes makes sense. You could just send the amount right before buying the product. There is no possibility to just not accept any transaction if there already is a transaction in the waiting list?
Edit: Like a tool for miners to scan their waiting list.
Edit2: Ok there's not really an incentive for that...
