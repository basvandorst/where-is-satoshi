I'm in at 620 so I hope to sell at 1200 or so to double my money :)

There will always be people spending bitcoins. Look at just the underground market alone.... $1.2 billion in revenue in one year......

I don't have a site yet, because I only sell on eBay/PreyPal. 
There needs to be an escrow site that people can buy and sell with an escrow system in place for LEGAL items.

umm. you buy bitcoins to invest... but with $50 you will make more money if you hold for a long time.

I'm looking for a site where I can list my items online, and they have escrow built into it. For example like a bitcoin trading site to sell anything.

bitcoin is the only crypto currency besides litcoin right now. there is nothing else that compares. There are many factors such as the underground black market, china, and Germany etc are fueling the increase in price. 
who cares about confirmation times... try dealing with paypal and when they hold your thousands of dollars for 90 days for no reason whatsoever. 
bitcoin is unregulated by any governments and has the potential to grow immensely !

its unregulated, and ungoverned. its anonymous. its fast. its revolutionary. its unsanctioned.
