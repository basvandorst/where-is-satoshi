He must be related to Jacob Schiff

Nothing to debunk here since it appears that you don't quite understand what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:09:51
“If they were truly currencies, you wouldn’t try to convert them or value them based off of other currencies" 
That doesn't make sense to me.
Why do foreign exchanges exist.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:20
coulda woulda shoulda

Do a search for "shift" on this sub
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:06:28
Wow shit would you look at that no way.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:00:58
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:31:12
Ya i mean what they say in the actual snap story you genius.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:02:03
Theres a sub where you can sell your panties.
If you don't wear panties yourself you can ask family for donations.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:51:19
You can also get a debit card thats hooked to a coinbase
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:57:17
So you can just pay yourself a bare minimum "salary" and pay your personal income tax in the lower brackets. If you need to go over the minimum, buy assets under an llc registered in nevada/delaware as business capital?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:17:07
Maybe they dont know about it yet?
You could always just test a small amount to see if it works.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:10:51
The blockchain itself.
Decentralized, transparent and anonymous transactions.
You cant have that with his "goldmoney.com" plug
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:16:36
And what do they say about it?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:13:17
I left a bunch of coins on mtgox thinking it was pretty "secure". Those are all gone now.
Checkout trezor.io
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:50:28
loose faith leads to loose change
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:52:53
I have a trezor.io wallet that im pretty happy with so far.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:06:01
How is it like a stock though?
Isnt it more like gold?
A stock is backed by an entity that could "disappear" therefore wiping out its value.
What could happen to completely wipe bitcoin out?
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:39:14
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:34:08
I like 
Who knows when it will take a huge fall though, thats part of the fun
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:07:47
You don't posses anything though.
You just know the password to a signature on a ledger, how do they make that illegal?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:13:18
Your fiat is attached to your economy.
Bitcoin is attached to the global economy.
Depending on where you are, inflation might be so high that it makes more sense to back your savings against the global economy.
Once more "rich" people trust and understand btc, it will go to the moon. Even if just like 5% of gold investors switch.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:03:04
So coinbase is currently in possession of your keys and you 100% trust in them to not get "hacked" or go bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:19:45
Youre looking at 1min??
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:12:45
every word^12 in the dictionary
Also mines 24 with trezor
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:36:49
figured its probably misleading.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:11:10
Except with gold, were not actually sure how much of it exists ?
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:25:59
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:10:56
Well the price is volatile but nothing can actually stop bitcoin and we know there is a limited supply right? apple has to continually perform well for your investment to grow while bitcoin just sits like gold?
If you're still just in college you have lots of time to ride out these corrections
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:59:55
Nooo not yet, let me buy some more first.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:07:04
Apple is a single point of trust though, bitcoin is backed by the internet. Is it really that much riskier long term? What could happen for bitcoin to go "belly up" ? Sorry im still pretty new to this
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:47:02
Youre saying there are people willing to sell at 1000 after seeing it at 4k+ and repeatedly bounce back after every dip.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:15:56
Kept all of mine in Mtgox, can confirm bad idea..
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:22:16
Have you considered keeping it secret?
Stash some away for the kids, say you got a bonus and pay off the debts.
Relationships can change drastically when money or the lack thereof comes into play.
If you want to treat her/yourself go to the "casino" first.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:02
yolo once bro
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:27
Plus the technology provides a new way storing/securing/transferring said value.
All physical assets can be taken from you if need be.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:36:40
Depends where you spend it
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:53:23
Such power many opportunity much corruption. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:28:59
and then?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:52:10
Pretends to spell it wrong so he cant be called out on it later on.
"Oh i said if bircoin reaches 1 million"
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:11:03
and now that $18 will cover fees for ~3 transactions. great.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:56:44
uncontrollable greed
