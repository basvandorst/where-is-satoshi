The libra is irrelevant. This looks like it was written by someone with zero understanding of the crypto space.

And how exactly would they back said tokens with fiat? By having a couple electronic digits in a bank account? Fiat is a smokescreen. It's backed by the ignorance of the population.

You do realize that absolutley nothing in the current fiat system is backed up by anything with real value whatsoever, correct? 
Not defending tether by any means but even if true not sure how this makes it any less legitimate than the electronic "funds" in your bank account.

Jack Dorsey should never be quoted on anything again. The guy is a fraud and a hypocrite.

Yes, it's terrible advice. There will be plenty of room for bitcoin and at the very least a handful of altcoins as well, especially once the crypto market becomes fully mainstream. The real question is figuring out which alts will also be winners down the line.

Oh man this is funny. Exactly what is been like for the past year.

So, you think Bitcoin will be soon be capable of doing everything that altcoins are attempting to do? Please explain... 
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:47:18
I wonder what altcoins would be worth investing in at this point. There have to be a few that will end up coexisting with bitcoin in the future by providing something additional whether it be functionality or even just redundancy. 
Litecoin for instance is banking on a mutually beneficial relationship with bitcoin and having a solid use case in conjunction with it, not by competing directly with bitcoin like many of these other coins are trying to do.

What's hilarious is the fact that fiat banks aren't even held to this standard.

Yawn... Get some new material. You trolls are boring as hell.

Why would he when he could just pay an army of losers to do it for him?

Every single time it has crashed it was never below the previous peak. Sounds like you're the one filled with the grandest delusions.

I'm expecting to be a billionaire in 5 months, because reasons.

Everyone never said that. Only a few bears went to that extreme.

What about the authenticator code generation? Isn't that currently un-hackable?
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:53:11
Even if the codebase was somehow compromised  it could be immediately forked with the code fix so I don't think you could kill off bitcoin that easily.

There is going to be a sizeable bounce off this resistance probably back to 4k or lower, think of all of the people who accumulated between 6-7k that are likely desperate to sell and break even.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:45:23
Every grouping of data is graphed with some sort of scaling or it can't be graphed at all. You don't have a clue what your talking about. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:27:13
I could see that. As for me I'm going to get my cash reserves ready for the likely dip.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:23:39
There are literally hundreds of idiots like yourself that have said the same thing: "bitcoin will never reach &lt;insert price here&gt; again" and they always end up eating their words. Even with the power of the internet where nothing is ever deleted you people still can't learn from your mistakes. Too funny!
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:01:44
The fact is its a major resistance over the past 1.5 years. There's no way that there won't be a bounce of some kind off of that level.
