So what happened if the Bitcoin price in FIAT has crashed to $10k ?
Would there be a margin call.... ?

Hold On Don’t Let go.

Yes, I can see the price is keep on dropping on BTC while BCH is keep on increasing.
Is this due to Coinbase listing next year ?

Does people know that when the big companies try to enter the market, they usually spread the FUD and fear first to shake off the weak hands ?

It seems the idea of Decentralized Bitcoin is no longer applicable on BCH since it is controlled by some larger groups of people :-| (or miner and Bitcoin Jesus).

Why still forcing the Fork that no one else is agreed ��❓

If it is suspended, when it will be continued or resumed ��❓

If the price of the coin can be manipulated by some groups of people, then it is not decentralised ��❓

How come is that long when you already open up Coinbase account ?

Sadly... no good news at all for BTC, only the series of bad news in the public, despite some good news here : 
Too many people, especially the government hates this BTC movement.

Thanks for sharing and enlighten us here.
I guess it is because of the China banning Crypto trading and JP Morgan CEO negativity.

Yes, Coinbase has charged me extra to buy BTC using Credit Card.
Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional "cash advance" fees. These fees are not charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement.

Go go TenX
It's been long overdue.

So what do we expect to get after the Segwit2x ?
Do we have to prepare something before ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:41:04
Why the upcoming Segwit2x is so much rejected ��❓
I’ve seen Charlie Lee also promote NO2X.
What’s wrong with it.

Somehow this issue does not crash the Bitcoin pricing. THe momentum still keep on bullish :-o ?
