The irony, but no; I am telling him not to throw his life savings into something so speculative especially if it is money at expensive rates e.g his credit card.

I manage a hedge fund, I have lost more than you will ever see, but I am still a successful investor. 
You are an investor with a get rich quick mentality and it is often people like you who get hurt the most, thus what happened.
If you are looking to invest, you typically start by doing so with your own money, not American Expresses.

wow you can calculate ROI, your math just blows me out of the water, you are so smart, I have never seen that before. Maybe the boiler room you work for in NY can add this great product for your clients. In the mean time, all I said was this guy shouldn't throw his life savings and sign his soul to debt for such a speculative investment. idiot.

Why would I delete anything? Alot happens after you get a college degree and series examinations. I am young and successful, a route that has allowed me to save money, not borrow it to get rich, I would post my bank account but it really doesn't matter lol. 
You should try some education yourself, it is obvious you never had any judging by the 30k of debt you had to squander; was it 30k of debt? or 30k of life savings you amassed? either way when you aren't wealthy and don't have leverage in a market then you don't belong...so go to take a nice vacation or learn something..maybe you can pay in bitcoins.
Are you stupid or just an asshole? Quitting your job? Talk about get rich quick. You are a lazy lazy old man who shouldn't play with money thats not theirs especially when your trying to use it to leave your job; it is like going to the casino to pay your bills, typically it doesn't play out.
I hope you enjoy your new retirement!

you didn't buy and hold, you bought a shitty investment and fortunately cashed out....im sure you paid some premiums along. its ok bad investments happen, maybe you should consult with a professional before you throw life savings around.

...im glad he got out, I hope he didn't get a note with a lot of fees attached to it. Even though he says he "got out" he still paid someone for all that money he borrow to get rich quick. It is a shame that this is probably a man who snubs the free market system, yet borrows 30k from it and sinks it into nothing valuable rather than a fund for this future?

unfortunately, my insurance company doesn't accept bitcents so i might just be completely out of luck.

you are a terrible investor, please stop.

The problem is, he is shit out of luck and cant buy his debt back with internet money.

angry? im sorry i felt insulted after you thought you "caught" me in some type of lie? calling me a poor college student? 
Because I said your investment was unwise and would hate to see anyone lose their money so foolishly especially when they are using life savings? 
Like I told you before, I am in finance, and simply suggested a safer product. 
you are the angry one who went out of their way to "prove something??????
You tried saying I was wrong for advising against a buy and hold investment when in reality thats not what you bought, your product was most  speculative and you were fortunate enough not to lose all of your money; thats all I was saying and the proof is in the pudding.
so again, enjoy your retirement, don't take my advice and seek safer alternative methods to yield returns.
