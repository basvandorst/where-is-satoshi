If you’re looking at the Swiss market consider that TWINT just rolled out everywhere.  have you thought to propose to TWINT a solution to a) prepay with bitcoin and b) an prepay option that holds bitcoin until a purchase (using lightning network) ?

I bought my first coin at USD 8.  It took me a few years to learn the secret of bitcoin is to buy and do nothing else.  No trading, no altcoins, and "cashing out" means putting your bitcoin in cold storage.  Consider yourself lucky to have learned this after only 6 months with minimal loss.

Some of that was me.  I am in Nigeria and my trip was extended by one week.  The hotel exchange rate is 1USD to 300 Naira, and the black market rate for cash is 1 to 450. I don't have the cash to cover my hotel bill and I was searching for a way to trade bitcoin for Naira.   Using a credit card would probably be at the bank rate which is bad.  In the end I used Bitpesa to transfer Naira to a Nigerian colleagues bank account, and she will give me cash.  The transaction took about 5 minutes and was really cool.  Bitpesa's exchange rate was pretty lousy, but still better than the bank rate. 
PS: The Nigerian prince comments are pretty tired.

Any post that begins "*Federal Reserve* just posted about *Blockchain* on *Facebook*..." is guaranteed rubbish.  Perhaps the Fed are thinking that if they just had a blockchain they could have fiddled with the ledger to fix the subprime crash.   
What I wanted to point out is that as bitcoin brings about their imminent demise, they are working through the 5 stages of grief and loss: 1. Denial and isolation; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining; 4. Depression; 5. Acceptance.  I think that now they are at the bargaining stage.  Maybe this is hubris, but I am looking forward to witnessing stage 4.
