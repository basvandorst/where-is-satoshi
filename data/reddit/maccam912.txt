Thanks for the answer. It is unrelated so I won't be surprised if you don't know, but if I did want to "purchase" khash's from somewhere to mine for me, like Scrypt.cc but a trustworty source, are there any similar but more reputable sites? Or is setting up something like Amazon the best bet and doing this myself? Or is none of this even profitable?

Awesome gesture! Every satoshi helps! This redd is barely worth any real money, but is just supposed to stay online as "internet points" to recognize generosity. I feel weird promoting it in this subreddit but what the hey. Use it as a cheap way to enlighten those who still don't know about cryptocurrencies.

It's amazing how much Poop_is_Food backs down as soon as he/she is shown up. To be honest I just have to take them at their word. Regardless, as I mentioned above, every satoshi counts. These redds are worth almost zilch right now and are just the cryptocurrency that is never meant to become USD. Just shared with people online when recognition beyond kind words seems warranted. Like I said above, redds are NOT meant to be hoarded. Save your BTC for stuff like real life donations. Keep the redds for introducing the uninitiated to cryptocurrencies

EDIT: Woah my karma! Just kidding. I was in an off-mood yesterday. I didn't mean all the hostility toward Poop_is_Food. A simple "Don't knock someone for at least trying" would have been enough of my opinion and everything else was over the top. Or is this for using reddcoin? I do feel bad tipping in other currencies in this sub but those tips are not meant to be donations to anyone. Just recognition of kind acts. Sorry Poop_is_Food bro.

Second the Gavin Andresen. I've interacted with him in the past and he is the most stand-up guy out there. If you have trouble getting in touch, make sure you are PGP/GPG encrypting emails. If you do that though he'll help coordinate discussions with other members of the community, point you in the right direction, and other hepful things. He's busy of course, so don't expect a personal tutor, But in my book he's the most reputable. Others could well be, but I have not interacted with them as much.

Thanks! Can't have too much in my wallet though! Better believe this is going to be paid forward before long.
EDIT: heh "wow so verify". I have to admit that cheered me up a bit (as much as your generosity).
Also, if you get notifications of edits too, could you briefly explain Vertcoin? I know it is meant to be very resistant to ASICs but any other reason people believe this one will become the standard for anything? Open question for anyone. You can PM if you want since it is not really related to the donations to the disaster.

Sorry for the hostility yesterday. I was in an off mood and you didn't deserve all of it. You donated 20 bucks. That is admirable, just like every other person who has gotten them up to 8 BTC. You deserve a "thanks for donating tip" as well as everyone else who donated.

Looking at what you've given away in redd I see generosity in your future too! Keep up the tipping. I know it is not much compared to what you must have in your wallet, but I don't want to be giving you more than what I've given to people who are donating what they can. Every bit (pun intended) helps and if I see someone apologizing for donating anything, feeling bad at all about sending money to begin with, they deserve internet points. And especially someone who gladly donates something at all only to be put down by someone who calls it a joke, they deserve better. I can't do much more than remind them that they gotta be happy they are donating more than the vast majority of the country/world.
Keep up the tipping! Someone down the line somewhere is going to deserve some redd that you'll notice and I'll miss. Pass them along for me if you'd be so kind.

The MAs are close in the bottom. I'm hoping to see them cross. If not and it plummets, time to see what people make of it. Buy low if you think you can sell high. I only learned from sports betting, but fading the public was the only thing that worked for me. People betting heavily on one side but for some unknown reason the odds (price) aren't changing? Something fishy is happening and it is time to do the opposite of the public.

Uh oh! IRS (if you're in the US) is going to get you for under-reporting! Not really though. It's a donation, the opposite of income. Same deal as before though: Nice job on donating at all! That takes selflessness most people can't honestly say they have. And its sad it takes a disaster to rally BTC donations but hopefully it'll put BTC on the map in a positive light. I feel bad but I can honestly say I donated because I could do so with BTC. Otherwise I would probably not because of the extra junk I'd have to go through to send money. Especially sending it in a way with such a low fee.

Just making sure you're aware you donated to LaCaner here. Not the donation fund for the disaster. Regardless, I love seeing the selflessness. Maybe doge passes coins around more than us. But when we start donating, we get pictures from the Mayor thanking us! And he thanked us for about 1/16th of what current donations are up to! $3,500 and counting. It's unfortunate it takes a disaster to get bitcoiners united, but we're generous when we do. It's just so EASY to send money. There wasn't even a minute of where people are like "I'd like to donate, but what is the easiest way?" We have that easy way. I like that you recognized someone for their generosity. Here's a small amount of a coin I have a bunch of to basically do the same to you.

Ints are 32 bits in both cases. long ints are 64 bits when compiled on a 64 bit machine, but are 32 bits when compiled for 32 bit machines.
@_date: 2012-10-13 16:32:44
I'm in uncharted waters with my knowledge here, but when you say ints are 16 bits, are you saying that in memory thats what an integer takes up? I'm pretty sure it depends on the computer. On 32 bit machines ints are 32 bits, 64 bit machines, ints are 64 bits. For some reason floating point numbers are different. I'm pretty sure on my 64 bit machine a double-precision floating point number is 80 bits. Who knows who came up with some weird number like that.

I've had one for awhile to automatically trade for me. Now I'm just looking for the best strategy. I had one that bought when the price was low but starting to go up and sold when the price was high and starting to go down. I had one that followed the turtle trading rules. I am using one now that buys when the price reaches the 48 hour high, then keeps a stop price and sells when the price reaches that.
If anyone has a strategy for me that can maximize profit, I'll share the trader with them.

I verified my identity and it still says that for me. My credit card, however, is part of some "verified by visa" thing that showed me how much their random charge was, and I was able to confirm my card on there anyway. I don't need BTC now though so I haven't tried using it yet.
@_date: 2011-11-28 16:07:12
It would tell me the same message about "funds not available..." but then I'd go back and it would have the link to activate my card, and since it had popped up with the "verified by visa" thing how much they wanted to charge, I put that amount in and it verified the card.

Just from looking at MetaTrader EAs I can tell you that which strategy you use would depend on you and your personality, but this would be my strategy:
I'd go for win/loss ratio, because having small but more consistant profitable trades will show you a profit that grows exponentially in the long run. Focusing on pure profit might give you very large swings of winning or losing, and you might end up over-optimizing the algorithm, where the strategy will work for the next few days and then start losing.

I put in money. Doubled quickly, and removed my original investment. I only invested what I could afford to lose, but losing money is always sad. Now even if it went to zero I would not be a single penny poorer than I was if I was any of those people who. My biggest concern now someone taking my USD. Then I'll wish I'd kept it in BTC. But for the moment, I own a significant amount of BTC which was basically free for me and any price fluctuations will be fun with absolutely no anxiety.
I learned a ton about economics, supply and demand style things, distributed peer-to-peer networks that can still verify everyone is playing by the same rules, how easy money transfers can be, crypto, and plenty of other stuff. And having 25 btc to play with should be fun. Day trading? Who knows? The worst possible scenario is that I become a grumpy old man who says bitcoin is a scam, but I'm not out any more than any of those less educated news anchors who bash bitcoin and invest nothing.

Gotta be honest, recently I've given BFL some credit. I placed an order with a credit card (so I could threaten a chargeback. One downside to BTC) and when I asked if they could ship before I had to start the chargeback process, they refunded my money. It took them awhile (2 weeks or so) but they did give me my money back without forcing their hand. I'm not sure if that is credible or not, but I'm glad they did the refunding, not the credit card chargeback investigators. So yes, a refunded order means they have more credibility in my eyes.

If you start off lucky and mine a lot of shares early on, you will have a higher percentage of the total shares for your pool belonging to you. As time goes on and luck plays less of a factor overall, your expected payout goes down. 
It could easily happen the other way around, where you aren't expecting to make much, only to find out you get more than expected.
If this is the case, then exchange rate has nothing to do with it. Once bitcoins are physically in your posession, the number of btc you have will not change like that.

Change addresses are for anonymity, but do mess up a lot of people who are trying to be extra careful. A lot of people don't like online wallets, but blockchain.info makes it super easy to set up a pretty secure (by online wallet standards) wallet that makes it easy to spend.
The hard part is getting fiat into BTC. I agree. I'm actually having trouble getting fiat OUT to my bank account temporarily actually. This part needs to be fixed.
People are hard at work trying to come up with a solution. I made a post recently about having great customer experience with a person who accepts bitcoin. They want people to adopt BTC, so they gave out a small bonus gift if you pay by BTC, so there was incentive there. (sorry I prefer not to say who this is, but it isn't some shady silk road dealer as I expect many minds will jump to).
There are people who are working on making things easier for you. [This]( or [this]( are getting close to market (one of them is on the market, one will share more details in may. They are hardware wallets that will negate the whole needing a secure computer to do bitcoin. It will all be handeled on a USB stick type thing. Security is important to them, so even a virus on a computer you plug it in to won't be able to steal any coins.
Any other questions: ask anyone here, including me, or PM if you'd like. It is up to you.
Once you have btc though it is super easy. They told  me "Pay this many btc to this address and we will ship your order. I did just that, and order gets shipped. A quick summary is that another competitor got my credit card declined somehow, and I would have possibly paid fees on top of it. Not fun. They have since contacted me and rectified the situation, but the BTC route is easy once you are set up.
So: If you live in the Minneapolis area by chance, I can sell you some coins. I haven't gotten around to sigining up on Localbitcoins yet, but may do so soon. I understand it is daunting, so if you have questions people here are always helpful, as well as myself. PM any questions, and I'll do my best to answer them.

Quick question: For people who have received BFL miners, how long does it take? Less than 60 days? I am still concerned about them being a scam to be honest. I don't trust them with my money, and I have 60 days to do a chargeback for not receiving my merchandise. Is it likely I'll have to get a refund or do a chargeback? I have emailed BFL from two different sources and have heard nothing from either. That was about a week ago.

My parents laughed at me back when I bought a video card to mine on. I only expected to make back my initial ~$100 investment (it wasn't a fancy video card). And way back in 2010 I thought mining on a macbook pro was a good idea. At the time the exchange rate was $1.20=1BTC. The macbook pro video card stopped working until I got it repaired, but at least now I know what all those early AAPL investors must feel like.

Correct. It is set up to basically install and run in one go. You gotta figure out the IP address of your RPi on the network I think but then pretty much all of the settings can be changed from a web server running on the minepeon RPi. Mostly the settings are just putting in your username and password for the workers at different pools.

I don't feel comfortable saying yes, unless you still have an "old" 0.8.1 backup of your wallet. Hang on to that. This is still a release candidate, which should be stable but isn't guaranteed to be. If you're comfortable with that risk, then I don't believe you need to do much more than that. It should be pretty seamless upgrades. The reason I'm hesitant is the fact it isn't the final version.

True. What I usually use it for is to show people that the 51% attack is tough if one entity tries it. We have ~70 THash/s, and adding 0.05 T/Hash is currently the fastest ASIC BFL promises to ship. So if my math is correct (which is completely possibly not) an evil entitiy would need to by 1400 of the fastest ASICs on the market to get anywhere close to 51%. And that isn't even including the number of normal, trustworthy people that are buying them as soon as they're shipping.

It hasn't received widespread adoption yet. That is the problem there. In theory though, it'd be along the lines of I have BTC, you have USD. I have a friend alice who I trust, but I don't trust anyone else. You have a friend bob who you trust, but nobody else. Alice and bob trust each other though. You tell bob "I want that guys btc, but I don't trust him. I'll give you USD that I trust you'll pay back, you give some currency to alice, she'll exchange it with me for my BTC (if I'm selling) and then she trades back with bob again, giving him her new BTC for some currency, and then bob gives you BTC to pay you back.

If everyone who was upset and told people to switch exchanges actually switched themselves it might help. Then they could have all the lag and bots they want and nobody would complain about it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:03:26
Bring on the downvotes for supporting Mt. Gox, but I haven't had a bad experience with them yet beyond lag so I'm biased.
Here is my plan: Let the trade lag happen. Eventually people will have dumb bots and lose their money, or smart bots, and stop trading temporarily.
People who can't handle it will leave. People who don't mind it will stay. Just let the trades unwind in the order they were submitted.
Basically, separate the trading engine from the website, so people who want to cash out can still do so, or cancel orders before they go through. Oh walt... that is already a planned feature arriving on the 17th I think.
So yeah, I don't think anything needs to be done. Upgraded servers would be fantastic obviously, since lag is not fun, but adding arbitrary limits to what sorts of trades can be made when seems very limiting.
(They've also been the victims of a DDoS recently, multiple times. This could always be the case again. Thats tough to deal with.)
Full disclosure: I'm running a bot. Not a high frequency trading one and not for super tiny amounts of money, but still a bot doing the trading instead of me. Trading bots are always going to exist, and handling them in some way other than just preventing them from working doesn't seem like the right solution.

BTC Guild won't control the network. BTC Guild does not control the hashing power. They just let everybody contribute a little hashing power and they pool it. If 10 people buy lottery tickets, and if one of them wins they share the prize with everyone else. In theory they're expected to win the same as if everyone just played by themself. But combining their power like this, they are 10 times more likely to win, but will only get 1/10th of the prize. It is more consistant payout.
BTC Guild is the one organizing this, saying "Donate your lottery ticket to the group we organized, and if anyone in the group wins, you'll get part of the winnings."
That is different than one person with 51 percent of the hashing power, who would then be creating their own lottery tickets, and claiming THEY have the the valid lottery tickets. Since they are a majority, they would get away with this. However, if BTC Guild got to 51 percent and tried to convice every miner for them to start making counterfeit lotto tickets, a lot of people would bail.
The issue I see is that if BTC Guild goes down, we lose half our hashing power. New blocks would take 20 minutes to mine instead of 10, and someone who previously had only 26 percent of the hashing power would now control more than half of the remaining hashing power.
Diversity is good. If you're a redditor who mines bitcoins, consider

They get lost, unless a family member or trusted other person has some way to access the private key.
 
Or maybe a system that asks you every 3 months if you are still alive a kicking. You have 3 months to respond that "Yes I am still alive." If, after this 6 month process, you have not responded you are alive, the btc are automatically sent to an address held by a trusted family member.
The maths might not work out how I'm imagining them, but I am getting tired and hopefully the general idea makes sense.

The official client has a (hopefully encrypted) wallet.dat that you should backup periodically. In a perfect world, you would backup after every time you send any btc somewhere.
One option, if you will have both the old and the new computers running at the same time, is to get the client set up and sync'd with the blockchain on your new computer, which will generate new addresses. Then send your entire balance to the new address. To me this seems easier.
The other option is to make sure you have the backup, and before you make any transactions with the new wallet, replace it with the old one. [This explains the process]( If you have any coins in the new wallet you are replacing with the backup from your old computer though, those could get lost.

mom &amp; pops do cash, which isn't "undoable" like I believe paypal and google wallet are. At least credit cards are. You can't take back a bitcoin transaction, but you can take back a credit card transaction, and that makes it risky to sell bitcoins to someone paying with a credit card.

Sorry for the btc loss. It is happening all too often. Can I ask if anything could have been done that would have alerted you to the fact you were in danger at any point of having the private key stolen? I also wish there was a way to prove I was a trustworthy guy. Along with other people. Some group you could go to that you knew weren't scamming you and were giving you honest, accurate advice.
And yeah, it definitely sends the info (insecurely, as a GET request over regular HTTP even) to the server, so it is super likely that someone captured the private key, waited until a substantial amount was in the wallet, and then split with the money.
**Bitcoin experts**: Does the relay node listed on blockchain have anything at all to do with who the identity of the scammer might be? A lof of times my transactions are broadcast from nodes half way around the world, but this particular transaction was relayed not 10 miles from me. Would that give us any advantage in finding the scammer?

TBH I'm not sure if debit cards allow chargebacks, but I'm definitely in uncharted territory in my knowledge of such things. I usually use my credit card, and haven't ever used a debit card online. It seems possible though, since people are working on Bitcoin ATMs which work with cash, and regular ATMs work with debit cards.
The reason I "bother" with BTC is because it makes transactions easy. Take the bitcoin tip bot for example. Or purchasing reddit gold. There are other ways to send money, but bitcoin is built on the internet and is just very convenient as a result. Often a link, copy/paste, or QR code scan is enough to send money on its way.

Just because I was curious and saw some discussion on mining, here is what I just mathed:
This looks like the RPi model B, so it uses about 700 milliamps. It requires 5 volts to run, and since amps x volts = watts, that means this will use 3.5 Watts. Since watts seem to be a confusing unit (watts already take time into account, so watts per hour doesn't make sense. When you pay for kilowatt hours from your power company, you can take the number of kilowatt-hours you used, the number of hours you used them in, and do kWh/hours to just get how many kW you use on average. This will be important later when i figure out what the RPi requires in kWh.)
Also, I'm ignoring Litecoin for now and assuming 900 hash/s for these for bitcoin mining. That is 0.9 khash/sec since a lot of people measure mining power in khash/sec.
Based on [blockchain.info stats]( we're at about 70 ghash/s for the entire network. That is 70 billion khash/s. The raspberry pi is adding 0.7 khash/s to the total. We also know the network is mining 25 BTC every 10 minutes on average, because thats just how it is set up.
So: You control one 100 billionth of the mining power on the network. On average, you can expect to get 2.5x10^-10  btc every 10 minutes. I was going to convert it to regular notation, but that is so tiny that scientific notation makes just as much sense. Every hour you can expect to make 6 times this, or 15x10^-10, or proper scientific notation, 1.5x10^-9. We're getting somewhere! In an hour you will make 1.5 billionths of a BTC every hour! Sadly, you're using 3.5 watts, and for this hour of mining, you are using 3.5 watt-hours (just multiply watts times hours). Since you are usually charged by the kilowatt-hour, with a kilowatt-hour being 1000 times more energy than a watt-hour, we'll convert to kWh. 1.5x10^-9 x 1000 = 1.5x10^-6. Yay! 1.5 millionths of a bitcoin every thousand hours, or 1.5 millionths of a bitcoin every kWh. The latest average price I've heard of is 12 cents per kWh. Using this, you will pay the power company 12 cents to get 1.5 millionths of a bitcoin.
So, in order to break even, 1.5 millionths of a bitcoin needs to earn you more than 12 cents. (0.12 USD/kWh) x (1 kWh/1.5 x 10^-9 btc), cancelling the kWh, tells us how many USD per BTC is the break-even point. 0.12USD/1.5e-9, which, multiplied by (666,666,666/666,666,666), or multiplying by 1 so we don't change the exchange rate we need but making sure we are getting USD/1 BTC (which is 132 USD/BTC right now), should give us the exchange rate to break even. exchange rate higher than this will give us a profit! Anything less will still theoretically get us BTC, but we'll pay more in electricity for it, even though it uses such a small amount of power.
So, the exchange rate to break even needs to be...
... drum roll please...
80 million USD per BTC.
tl;dr: I don't want to speculate on what the exchange rate of a bitcoin will eventually get to, but don't go buy a raspberry pi just for mining purposes. It is not very profitable.
If I messed up my math definitely correct me. I've been up too long and need some sleep, but to the best of my knowledge I did the math correctly. Regardless, if you do mine with your RPi, you'll be making more than me. Right now I have a server running which earns me nothing whatsoever.

Your debit card is just a convenient portal between your bank account and wherever you want to spend your money. My BTC is my actual money. I can use my debit card, but my bank charges fees if I use it too often, not often enough, etc. Credit cards are more profitable for banks, but retailers pay a 2% fee or so to accept credit cards.
On the other hand, if I buy something with BTC, I am sending the BTC directly to the merchant. Person to person. I'll concede that price is not very stable, but I'm always in control of my money. You have a lot of people promising you that your money will always be there in your bank account, but ultimately they are in control of your money, and you just trust them with it. With bitcoin it is more like cash: I'm responsible for making sure it isn't stolen but I have full control over it.

I'm toying with a way to get a hardware BTC wallet up and running, hopefully for cheap like on an Raspberry Pi (right now I'm using my chromebook, so a little more expensive).
There is no OS on the computer, and a variant of Tails ( is booted from a flash drive with wallet clients, vanitygen, offline versions of bitaddress.org, etc. I would somehow to remove or disable wireless drivers so there is no way to be attacked through the network, but I haven't gotten there yet.
Anyway, this USB you boot from would have a persistant section (the rest of it is like a CD: Can't be changed once it is "burned," and it will always boot into the exact same configuration. The persistant portion of the flash drive is encrypted (tails has this built in) and would store all the actual wallets, private keys, etc.
I'm still working on a way you could safely enter the password for the encrypted section without it possibly being intercepted. perhaps some yubikey could be used instead of a password. Not sure yet.
Anyway don't expect anything from me very soon. Its a pet project right now, but if I get it to a point where I think is worth sharing, I'll share it with everyone.

Potentially better than dd: writing a C program to read each byte and write it to somewhere else that is safe. In any case, make sure you have as thorough of a copy as possible of the USB stick. From what you've said so far, the file likely hasn't been overwritten yet, but the file system deleted the reference to the file. Even if the location isn't known any more and it is marked as free space now, unless you've written something else to the same blocks on the flash drive the bytes won't have changed. I don't claim to be an expert at file system recovery tricks, but feel free to ask questions, and don't plug that flash drive back in until you know what your plan of attack is, and know that that plan will actually work.

My 0.02 btc: start mining and helping the community! I got the same USB ASIC Miner probably and I doubt I'll get all of the money back, but it is fun for some reason to see the little green light blink as I find shares. Join a mining pool. And if you do the raspberry pi route:
look up MinePeon, or just be lazy and go to the link below. That is what I use. It makes it dead simple to use a RPi to mine. Make sure you have an externally powered USB hub though to power the miner (and probably also the RPi. Then the USB hub can be plugged into the RPi (sort of plugging the RPi into itself, but it doesn't matter since the power comes from elsewhere) and away you go. One cord to get the contraption online, one to get the power to the USB hub.
Hopefully you didn't go in expecting to make a bunch. You'll get BTC, definitely, but it'll take a long time to pay back the hardware cost. If the price of a bitcoin skyrockets though, then you'll have that much more value in your back pocket!

A) Agreed.

I guess it basically comes down to personal preference: I'd rather have control and ultimate responsibility over my money, and am willing to give up some of the stability in value for it. Having said that, I still do use USD quite often.

It sometimes looks like it is making server connections, but that is just generating the qr codes. Unplug your computer if you are worried, and there is no way it will share it online.
Also, blockchain.info wallets let you add "watch only" public addresses, and with alerts set up you can have it text or email you when money enters or leaves an address, even if you don't know the key. Maybe add the scammers address and update us if he ever moves the money or adds it from another source?

I have been wondering about this, and you sound knowledgeable enough to answer. I always tell people "Bitcoin doesn't use floating point ops, but if you converted the power to the equivalent in flops it is X PetaFLOPS (exaFLOPS now I suppose)". I haven't gotten asked, yet, but how exactly do they estimate the conversion? Is it based on power? I understand the hashes/second, and is there an easy conversion of now many floating point ops it takes to do a 256 bit hash?
EDIT: Killerstorm does have a good answer to this. However, The Genesis Block did an article that brought this up and had a concise answer. For people wondering the same thing, here is the answer according to TGB:
The FLOPS estimate is based on the opportunity cost of computers using their hardware for mining instead of other applications.  Miners are using their graphics cards to perform hashes instead of other FLOPS-based distributed computing. Therefore, a conversion rate of 1 hash = 12.7K FLOP is used to estimate what this hardware could be doing.
Second paragraph: 
EDIT 2: EDIT AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS:
It is brought up later in the article about how the conversion breaks down a little when talking about ASICs, but here is the basic idea they mention:
The conversion still does hold true in the sense that these super computers don't have ASIC chips in them and any mining they do would still be done on hardware that takes 12.7K FLOP to do one hash. New supercomputers could be made with asic chips I suppose, and the conversion would get pretty wonky, but for now, even though ASIC chips being measured in FLOPS would be a dumb conversion, measuring the equivalent amount of normal computing power in FLOPS to get the same performance at hashing that the bitcoin network has still holds true.

You should be able to set how much to pay for a fee, including none at all. Eventually though, when all the coins have been mined, miners will still need an incentive to be the book keepers. These fees encourage the miners to include your transaction in their block.
You can choose not to include a fee, and it will eventually be included in a block down the road, but if you want faster processing of your transaction, the fee will make it more likely that your transaction is included. A fee isn't mandatory, but it is becoming a better idea all the time.
If you go into the Options menu in Bitcoin-Qt, it should have a place where you set a default fee. Just set it to 0 for a small test transaction.

Best solution I know of: Get Bitcoin-Qt client, sync with blockchain, and use Armory.
Bitcoin Armory runs on top of the Bitcoin-Qt client, and can be run in offline mode for safer storage of large amounts of coins, but that is for another discussion.
When you make a wallet with bitcoin armory it will give you the key it used to make your wallet. Keep this key safe and secure. You lose this, your bitcoins can get stolen or potentially lost.
The way Armory works is slightly different than the standard client. With the one private key it will generate future bitcoin addresses in a deterministic way. If you needed to restore from backup, the private key Armory told you about can recreate all these exact same bitcoin addresses on another machine. As far as I know the Armory is the only way you can make a paper backup of a wallet and not have to keep making new backups as new transactions are made.

If you never do nefarious things with bitcoin, the precautions of using TOR and only downloading at libraries/starbucks and only anonymous cash transactions don't apply as much. The rest (using tails live CD) is a good idea to keep your bitcoins more safe though. Viruses are no doubt looking for insecure wallets, and live cds are one of the best ways (if offline only is possible, the best way) to make sure nobody steals your coins.
However, if you believe in anonymity of bitcoin and want to help, keep doing above the table things, using these same techniques. If the only people using these extreme precautions are those people willing to hide something, it will draw attention to people buying/selling in cash only. If you can, just do completely legal transactions but still do only cash transactions at anonymous hotspots, so that it can be reasonably argued that just because someone only deals with cash doesn't mean they are up to no good.

This subreddit seems to disagree with me, but thank you for posting this.
Anyone would have trouble dealing with the traffic you deal witih. Send all of it to any other exchange. I'd like to see them try to keep up.
You've had these lag issues, but you immediately post here, blogs, etc. about what has happened. No bull.
You've been in the game the longest. You've been hacked before. I presume you have safeguards against something like this happening again.
Not only have you been hacked, but you lost coins, but vowed to pay back lost coins so the loss wasn't felt by any of the users. Unlike some other exchanges, you took full responsibility for the security breach.
I've never had trouble exchaing money when I want to exchange money. Day traders might have issues with lag, but I generally don't day trade, and only use an exchange I know has worked in the past (and I can trust) and can guess will work in the future.
You are safer than most other exchanges. They're working on it, but you sent me a yubikey that I keep with me all the time. In order to do anything, a hacker can't just have my username/password. They can't even intercept SMS if that is even possible. I use one time keys, and even if the key is stolen, it won't be able to be used again.
Thanks for being professional about this. I agree bitcoin should be decentralized. Bitfloor looks pretty sweet. I like CampBX where I can trade on margin and such. But let everyone else on the subreddit abandon you. Then the problem is other exchanges lagging from too much data. I don't think you could have handled the situation any better than you did, and I'll probably be sticking around.

Brainwallets are only as safe as you make them. The idea behind them is, instead of generating a random private key, you put a passphrase you can remember through a specific function to generate a private key, and in the future you can put the same passphrase through the same function to get that same private key.
Brainwallets are a cool idea, but make sure you have a very difficult to guess passphrase.
