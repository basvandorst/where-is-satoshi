You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, so really whatever you’re willing to invest and potentially lose. I’d start with $20-$30 and practice not selling and following the news and trends. Maybe in a month buy more. I suggest not doing what I did and don’t buy a lot in your first month.

Surprised it hasn’t moved. Cool thing about the Blockchain is that you’ll be able to watch what happens to it. Once it hits an exchange you can start talking with the exchange. Probably won’t get you anywhere though.

If the price of bitcoin doubles you'll have $40 if you bought at 11k, so you'll have $20 profit.
However, if bitcoin does what it did last year (increase 1000%) you'll have about $220 profit off your $20.

Look at a graph for the past 10 years. This year was insane. Some people got rich this year from putting in $20 6 years ago and forgetting about it. There’s no telling what it’s going to do this year. It may repeat last years progress or go back to $500 a coin. It is a high risk investment, which is why you should never invest more than you are willing to lose. Since you are 17 and don’t have a lot of income, I’d suggest making a savings plan that fits your needs. For example, every month invest 90% of your savings into a bank account and invest the other 10% in crypto. Learn about having a “safety net”, which is basically keeping 3-4 months total of cash of all your expenses in a low risk account (savings account), just in case your life gets bad. Never invest more in anything risky than you are willing to lose (trust me it takes the fun out of it when you are worried about the riskiness). Invest a reasonable amount for your portfolio and you’ll enjoy watching your currencies value grow rather than stress. 
You should also learn about other cryptocurrencies and find ones that you believe will be successful. There are many coins out there just starting out that you can get 100 coins  for a dollar, however these coins may not go anywhere and are much riskier investments than bitcoin, but they could go up from 1 cent to a dollar, 100x your original investment. 
Again, never invest more than you are willing to lose! This means if you lost this money you wouldn’t give a shit and move on with your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:07:29
$200 a month is great. I’d use Blockfolio to setup alerts when the price of a coin you are interested in takes a dip. Since you are investing monthly you can time your transactions a little to improve your return. Alternatively, if you just put money in on day x every month and hold off on selling you’ll come out ahead or at least have less impactful losses.

@_date: 2018-05-13 17:38:31
25 cents to send $50 BTC from coinbase to a private wallet. Less than a cent to send $50 BCH. BCH was stupid fast as well. 
I know I should pick a wallet that lets me pick my priority and stuff. But that was my general user experience today. 
Since you are likely more experienced than me in transacting with cryptocurrencies, do you think I could have accomplished the same thing with bitcoin by tweaking settings in my transaction? Do you think if BCH had the same amount of usage as BTC the fee would be the same?

Hey, so the weekend is winding down and I've done a ton of crypto research. Just wanted to say thanks for your input and being able to have a knowledgeable and polite discussion. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:01:45
Holy crap this came out longer than expected.
I’ve listened to Roger quite a bit in the past few days and am understanding where he’s coming from. Really attempting to have a discussion here. According to Roger that’s impossible and I’ll be censored.... but let’s try!
From what I understand, Roger believes BCH is more similar to the way bitcoin used to work and what was outlined in the whitepaper. Instead of using a layer 2 solution he instead believes an on-chain solution is achievable with block size increases. Since blocks weren’t full until recently, block sizes were increasing on their own, just less than 1mb. Since Bitcoin has capped the block size to 1mb it is not able to continue in the same trajectory that it once did. Instead of increasing the block size, developers are working on alternative solutions using layer 2 methods. 
It’s very hard to find an analogy that doesn’t come off as sounding extreme. The best I can do is make up a hypothetical situation where  amazon.com is being flaunted on the news to a new demographic, that demographic is very interested and start buying. Amazon is no longer able to fulfill 2 day shipping due to the flood of orders. Let’s say Amazon has a hypothetical patented shipping process called a2z. They refuse to hire more people in the warehouse, which is where their bottleneck is.
The reason they don’t want to hire more people is because they are afraid that as more and more people use their service, more people will need to be hired and it will have some type of consequence(I can’t think of a good analogy - and I do understand this is an important part of the issue. Not trying to look over this - will address on it later). 
So instead they start charging people more for 2 day shipping and making others wait. In addition, they promise it will only be temporary because they are working on robots to replace humans. In the meantime, the average consumer decides they don’t want to pay $50 more to ship their goods and they will either A) just go to Walmart down the street or B) use other possibly sub-par online retailers that offer free 2 day shipping. 
Now someone comes along and says “I am making a business that has everything Amazon has, but we are willing to hire more people to fulfill free 2 day shipping. We will use Amazon’s a2z process but just hire more people. We anticipate we’ll be able to do this for a while and if the robot solution works out then we can use that too.”
Amazon’s a2z worked for years until Amazon hit a bottleneck by making a rule to not hire more people - started developing robots that are not widely available for use and aren’t ready yet, in the meantime losing customer base because they aren’t able to offer 2 day shipping. Meanwhile, the other company hired more people and are able to fulfill 2 day shipping as it once existed with Amazon for years. 
So which is the a2z process? The new one that amazon uses because amazon made it, or the one that Amazon made and is being used the same way it was being used for years before amazon decided to not hire more workers.  
This is why Roger believes Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 
The reason this topic is not black and white is because the devil is in the details. Amazon wont hire more employees because it may have some future impact if they hire too many employees. The catch is, nobody wants to use their services because shipping rates are so high. So they either go back to what they are used to (easy) or go to an Amazon alternative (less likely but if the online shopping experience is interesting to the individual it may happen). Comically, Amazon will never replace local Walmart if they aren’t usable now, so the issue they are worrying about with too many employees will never happen. 
I think I’m pretty reasonable. I tried not to be too biased in this analogy and would love to see working layer 2 solutions provide cheaper transaction fees. At this time, however, I can at least see where the Bitcoin Cash team is coming from. Especially with the out that technologies that can be used on Bitcoin can (apparently) be used on Bitcoin Cash. 
Would like to hear your thoughts on the a2z analogy and anything else I’ve said. 
I’d like to keep the discussion pleasant if at all possible as I believe finger pointing and name calling diminishes the discussion. I apologize is advance if anything I said comes off as offensive, but would like to know what was if so.

Interesting, so the root of this debate is coming down to Moore’s Law. I’d argue CPU and hardware manufacturers will find ways to keep up, at least somewhat sufficiently. 
I wonder how many years a $700 desktop PC could run a Bitcoin Cash node, assuming every 2 years they double the block size. I’ll do some thinking on that math...

I stumbled on this video today. Currently watching. Heres some research on a testnet with 1gb blocks. 
Not trying to form an argument off this, but is very interesting research. 
Edit: this is following up with my generic computer math question. Not an answer to my question but related. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:31:31
Gold has multiple uses (store of value, jewelry, electronic conductor). Bitcoin has little to no value if it is no longer a currency. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:05:56
And you think increasing the block size will lead to centralization because a Moore’s law won’t keep up, right?
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:10:11
You’re right, so in the math I’d have to account for block usage. Assuming full blocks would be more than reasonable, even though in the real world BCH developers would increase block limit to accommodate the block usage (this last sentence isn’t a knock on bitcoin, but seems to be what BCH would likely do based on their goals of staying a fast and cheap currency)
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:26:21
Yes, but we are talking about something that functions as a system and is/was being bottlenecked, so it is relevant. 


Do you not believe technology will improve (Moore’s law) so people will be able to run full nodes on $500 machine or even a 8 year old laptop? 
Mass adoption can’t happen currently because Bitcoin can’t come up with a functional off-chain solution that works as well as an on-chain solution.
Not to sound aggressive, but it sounds like Bitcoin is making a problem to prevent a problem that doesn’t exist yet. I appreciate the proactive-ness, but I think we could either rely on Moore’s law (for the time being while adoption has a chance) or come up with a clever solution for solving the problem while increasing the block size for the time being (I know this is a hard fork that they are trying to prevent). 
I guess what I’m getting at is that I think Bitcoin should have increased block size a workaround to keep the Bitcoin network functional during its peak while continuing to work on offchain solutions. We’ll know in a few days the effect of changing the block size on-the-fly when BCH bumps up to 32mb. I’m betting, in a month, everything will be back to normal but what do I know. 
Of course, all this is based on the Roger Ver assumption that people stopped using bitcoin because transaction fees were so high, which I halfway believe. (I think it was trending, people thought it was an investment, it dropped, and people got out). I hate how is argument relies on this so much. He’s definitely not 100% right but I don’t think he’s wrong either. 
Tons of layers to this issue, with one change causing multiple changes. 
But back to the name Bitcoin, I still think what Bitcoin Cash is doing is closer to what is in the whitepaper. Should we base all our choices on the whitepaper is another topic, as it was written years ago without knowledge of today’s technology. It did however rely on Moore’s law which has held up pretty well but has slowed due to technology limitations and future advancements.

That’s true. Thinking about it more, I think my argument is more for sending someone money (like paying back for a beer the next day) or buying via web purchase. 
In-physical-store purchases would require both parties be online either way for a bitcoin transaction since the vendor would likely want to verify the transaction some how on their end. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:00:53
Instead use a protocol that requires being online to receive a transaction. Wait that’s fine, just use this service to host your lightning wallet. To me this is more centralized sounding than not being able to run a full node on a raspberry pi. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:50:43
That last paragraph is very debatable and borderline brainwash material. There’s a whole other group of bitcoin advocates at with a different point of view on the way bitcoin transactions are handled. Roger Ver pretty much leads this group - whether or not the bitcoin cash guys say he does or not. Roger Ver, once a very strong Bitcoin advocate, did not agree with Bitcoin’s new solution for handling a lot of transactions... thus bitcoin cash was born with a different solution for handling a lot of transactions. Both parties think the other party is more centralized. 
Not trying to start a war with this comment (is very passionate that bitcoin cash is the devil), but trying to be unbiased and not brainwash the newcomer.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:22:09
I’m from but like reading both subs to get differing points of view. Definitely a lot of new accounts on as well. Lots of trolling either way. Kind of dumb if you ask me. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:53:54
That’s true, but bitpay is also a payment processor. When the transaction doesn’t work the support team that handles it is bitpay. They are responsible for processing the payment. 
I can see the argument that the consumer shouldn’t be involved/care what happens after BTC is sent to a wallet though (in this case bitpay converts it to fiat). 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:48:04

Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:08:28
They would still provide support for the bitcoin protocol so the store doesn’t have to deal with the nuances. For example, Customer says they sent Bitcoin but the transaction isn’t showing on the store’s end. Instead of the person answering the phone having to know details about bitcoin, they can call the payment processor and have it looked into. A middleman vendor is perfectly reasonable in this case. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:27:15
I think it is a good thing that companies are accepting bitcoin while using a payment processor of their choosing.

You can receive a tweet if you’re not online. If you are not online and someone tweets you it will still be there when you come back online. 
The last time my mobile phone was not online was when I was running in the mountains last weekend. I also occasionally lose signal while driving to work every day. 
The last time my internet service provider went out at my house was earlier this week. 
It’s not efficient for a business to not be able to receive payments because their internet is down. It relates to running an email server from the office vs running it in the cloud. A majority of businesses have moved email services to the cloud. Businesses that need to be able to receive lightning payments will very likely use a cloud service to do so.

Do you not understand that businesses pay companies to manage the things that they don’t understand in a tradeoff to not have to manage it themselves? Shops are choosing a payment processor for this reason. I understand that bitcoin can handle all by itself.

Bought high. No reason to sell since I don’t need the money I invested. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:06:17
Because there’s a demand for it by people who want to use bitcoin to pay. I understand wanting to keep the bitcoin you spend in the ecosystem and not have it immediately sold. I just think, at this stage, an all-in, must not only accept bitcoin but never sell it for fiat, attitude toward bitcoin adoption will be detrimental. You’re saying it yourself, you’d rather a company just stick with fiat than accommodate bitcoin users. How does that help adoption? 
I believe adoption starts with users owning bitcoin and businesses accepting it, then doing whatever they want with it. The next step is for businesses to realize it’s more efficient for them to keep bitcoin on hand rather than cash it out every time. Demanding all-in adoption will result with everyone just sticking with fiat.
