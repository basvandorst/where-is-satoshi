Amazon sells a good amount of fake stuff. I would not trust a HW wallet from amazon. Straight from the manufacturer, even if it costs a bit more. When you are storing lots of value you don't take chances. All it takes is one fake ledger and all your coin is gone.

You will be good on the exchange for a week. Just order the Ledger or Trezor. ONLY directly from the official websites. There are fakes of everything these days on Amazon and Ebay. Never order from them when large holds of value are at stake.

It also isn't even a secure site. I say 100% you are going to get scammed if you try to buy through them.

Bitcoin atm's themselves are sketchy and underpay. Don't even bother with that site. If you are trying to avoid fees. You can't. Buy from a trusted source and pay the small fee.

Uh now seems like your chance at redemption bud.

I just tried to scan my license on CashApp. Front scans fine. Back highlights blue but never scans. MN licence.

Robinhood if it is available in your state. They asked me to verify my address after I used a fake state (I am dumb for using a fake address and had to resolve it) but you can instant trade small with no fees.

I am going to have to move elsewhere since I had to provide proof of address.

Funny way to put it

Meant to rely to you. But robinhood lets you do lots of small buys/sells with no fee. It must be available in your state. I tried using a fake state and they detected it and I had to send proof of residence.
