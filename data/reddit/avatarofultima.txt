Bitcoin goes up fast when other people see it going up and hop on the bandwagon, causing it to snowball.  
This time when it starts going up, we have exchanges all over the world.  Do the math.  
Yes, $10,000 could certainly happen.  
The Winklevoss twins were predicting $40,000 back when it was selling for $10.  I thought they were fools and didn't buy any.  After it went from $10 to $1,000, I realized I was the fool.
Don't.  Underestimate.  Anything.

The halvening isn't priced in, because it can't be.
Miners collect coins, open shorts, dump.  Collect coins, open shorts, dump.  This has been ongoing for years.
Suddenly the miners are going to have half as many new coins to dump.  
This can't be priced in.

Bitcoin still had a high hashrate when the price was $160 last summer.  
Even if the price remained the same at $420 / 2 (which I highly doubt, I fully expect it to go up), this would still be higher.  
I don't think we are going to see a huge impact on mining after the halvening.

The Winklevoss twins predicted $40,000 bitcoins when they were selling for $1 each.  
I laughed at them and thought they were fools.
Then bitcoin shot up to $1,000.  
Apparently I was the fool.

I don't trust Poloniex.
I mean, what do you really know about them? Their public address is just a small building in the middle of nowhere with a drop box. They have no phone  They have no information anywhere about any of their employees. Their CEO, do you have any idea who this even is? They are even hosted by a shady firm that advertises the fact that they can't be traced in any way.
Meanwhile, they have everything on you. (if you trade with any volume) Name, address, phone  social security  photo ID, etc.
They have everything on you. You have nothing on them.
Yes, they have been honest and trustworthy so far. But if they ever decided to change this, there is absolutely nothing you could do about it. They could disappear with all your funds, and then turn around and commit wide scale identity theft against you.
The same people complaining that banks have too much power over you are using services like this. Irony.

So what's the next step?
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:10:13
Exactly, this is what I've been saying all along.
Get a price app on your phone.  Set it to notify you if the price goes up $10.  It'll go off a couple times a day.  When it goes off, immediately check forums to see if ETF was approved.  If not, go back to what you were doing.
You will literally, easily, be able to go all-in within minutes of an approval decision being announced.  
Free, easy money, with absolutely no risk.    This is the most obvious play ever.

Pictures like this are the reason I'm investing in bitcoin right now.  All over the world you see exchanges, ATM's, local start-ups, etc.  People only flock into something when they see it skyrocketing.  If bitcoin starts skyrocketing again, people are going to have far more places to flock to than they did last time it happened in 2013, which could create a self-fulfilling snowball effect.  
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:01:54
They can't find the missing Gox coins.
They can't track down coins paid to people using cryptolocker.  
They can't find the coins from exchange hacks.
They can't find the coins stolen from wallets.  
Etc etc.
I think finding coins is an order of magnitude more difficult than people think it is.

New administration doesn't *increase* the likelihood of it being approved, it *decreases* it.
There is a chance (in my opinion small, but still a possibility) that the Bitcoin ETF could be a disaster, it is certainly not without risk. 
Would your first step as a new administration be to approve a controversial initiative with risk of catastrophic failure?  My money is on "No".

Answer this simple question: Would you bet your money right now on a 50/50 coin toss?  If yes, buy right now.
If not, wait for the decision to be announced.  If it's approved, buy immediately.  If it's denied, wait and buy a week later.  
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:07:45
This was the right thing to do.
If the ETF is approved, you simply buy back in.  Yes you'll miss some of the immediate gains, but let's be honest...the ETF approval is going to last longer than 5 seconds.  If you buy back in immediately after the announcement, you'll get days or weeks of gains, minimum.
Keeping your coins right now just isn't worth the risk of it being denied followed by a catastrophic crash.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:34:08
You can, but wouldn't want to.  If you buy $10,000 worth, you're pushing the price up nearly 15% on the exchange.

You literally have to deposit money *to* Coinbase, and *then* buy your coins if you want it to be a guarantee.

OP is asking a legitimate question.  If the Chinese authorities raided and shut down all mining operations in the country, it would be catastrophic to the price.  Bitcoin would recover, as mining operations would open elsewhere, but you'd want to sell your holdings immediately, and wait to buy back in lower.

I am actually worried about this.
I invested roughly $100,000 into Bitcoin on Coinbase, just to watch it drop to being worth about $25,000.  
Rather than sell for a loss, I decided to start trading.  After a year and a half of trading Bitcoin and alt-coins back and forwardth across 5 different services, I finally got my $100,000 back, and cashed out. 
If the IRS needs exact details, this is going to turn into a nightmare.  Plus they'll somehow most likely try and tax me for my "winnings" to boot.  (I was taxed on gambling winnings despite actually losing money that year, and proving it.  Lost $10,000 and then won $7,500?  Okay, you us taxes on that $7,500)
I don't have any faith in Coinbase's privacy protection, so fully expect them to comply.

This is why I believe Satoshi's biggest mistake was choosing the number 21 million.  I think adoption would have been much more significant by now if he had chosen 1 billion or higher.  There is a shocking number of people who see "1 bitcoin now worth $1,000" and think "Wow, I can't afford to invest in that." There is a reason why bitcoin reaches that number and stagnates.  The masses hardly understand what the word "divisible" even means.   Hopefully we can get past it on this incoming attempt, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if we flop again here.

They did.  This myth that people bought for a penny and sold for $1,000 is not realistic.  *(I can count the number of people that did this on one hand, with room to spare)* When you have 10,000% growth, you sell.  You don't wait for 1,000,000% growth unless you are a fool.  Most of the people that had BTC when it was worth a penny sold when it was worth 10 cents, if you want reality.
