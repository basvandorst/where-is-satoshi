I recently got a question like this What if someone said i was able to send and settle my money  within 1 hour using beem it = apple pay = major aus banks = xcurrent but moving to xrapid q1 2019 .. when i moved $  that was and any currency converted free under 10k few dollars if over. when i moved xrp i did it in  4 seconds  sent 90k as a test . They also have smart contracts which is even smarter than etherium that was seven will be utilized by World bank's which equal liquidity demand which means price rise why would we need Bitcoin if we got something like this which doesn't need mining for example in Iceland they are giving more energy to bitcoin machines than their actual own residents
