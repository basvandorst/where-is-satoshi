It doesn't go into any such details. But my point is that it wouldn't matter. If they did, then the weaknesses would be fixed, and we'd be left to wonder the same thing (whether there was another cleverer way of gaming the system). The problem is that (a) the software needs (and might *always* need) maintenance and (b) mining pool operators can speak for their clients.

They get the wallet, but not the passphrase (or vice versa if you want to keep their inheritance a secret). The passphrase is stored somewhere that they know about, but won't be able to access while you're alive (e.g. your safe deposit box).

Maybe numbers will help:
A = 1 BTC = $500.00
B = Cost of materials, labor, banking fees, taxes, licensing, profits, etc. = $40
C = Cost of anti-counterfeiting measures in physical coin (must be removable so that bitcoin is spendable) = $10
We can change them to anything else you want later. You'll find that it doesn't change the argument. Under these circumstances, 1 physical bitcoin would sell for 1 PhBTC = A + B + C = $550 on the manufacturer's website. So let's suppose we like it and trust this guy, so a whole bunch of us buy them.
There is a little bit of awkwardness as we and start using them like we would fiat. In addition to BTC volatility, there are complications such as making change, but let's suppose all that boring stuff has been dealt with (although I have no idea how given that $50 of the cost is fixed no matter the value of the coin). Now there's the question as to whether one can purchase a $550 item with 1 PhBTC. On the one hand, that's what they paid for it. Who's going to go out and buy 1 BTC = $500 (that they have to carry in their pocket) at a price of 1 PhBTC = $550?
One answer might be the buyer paid that $50 for convenience. Do you think you can raise enough concern about EMPs and white-listing (which is arguably nearly equivalent to making bitcoin illegal, which would still be a problem for PhBTC) to get people to buy them? Enough that they will alleviate the scaling problem? (If you really understand the scaling problem, you know that's a *lot* of physical bitcoins. Probably enough that there would be absolutely massive additional costs to the manufacturer. But this is make believe, so I guess we needn't address that here either.) Maybe you can, but it doesn't matter anyway. Another answer is that they should be worth $550 (or even $525 as a compromise). You've offered no solution to this problem so I'm not sure what your take on it is, but again: it doesn't matter.
The problem is that all I have to do is fill out some forms on a Chinese website and I can purchase the same holographic stickers we find on PhBTC (close enough for the man on the street). Let's even say I buy in smaller orders, so they cost me $100 instead of C = $10. Well now I can buy 1 PhBTC for $550 (total cost $650), copy the private key, and replace the sticker (the key isn't swept until well after the PhBTC is spent, so all this is untraceable too). I've paid $650 and I'm walking away with 1 BTC + 1 PhBTC = $500 + $550 = $1050. Yes, it's illegal. We might try to sue the Chinese sticker producer (good luck) or arrest the counterfeiters, but we'll *never* get all of them. This will be a *huge* problem. Due to the fact that you get to spend those (Ph)BTC twice--you might even call it a "double spend problem".
Okay, so let's fix it by making it really difficult to counterfeit. How? Increasing B has no effect since we buy *and* spend the PhBTC in our scam. Decreasing A or increasing C have the same effect. First of all determining the street value of 1 PhBTC becomes *much* more awkward. For example suppose we increase C to $460 so 1 PhBTC = $1000. (By the way, it is not *nearly* that simple to make things more difficult to counterfeit and you have yet to put forward a proposal as to how this might be accomplished--or how we could trust any such proposal.) If 1 PhBTC = 1 BTC then *nobody* will buy them. If banks charged 50% for cash withdrawals, how many people would use cash? Same for buying PhBTC at $1000. But maybe we agree to exchange them at the purchase price (again, how we accomplish that with BTC fluctuation is a difficult question, but we'll pretend some more). So now we've got 2 BTC = 1 PhBTC. Are these really even the same currency any more? Won't people just develop preferences and start using BTC exclusively on-chain and PhBTC completely off-chain? Who in their right mind would move a PhBTC onto the chain and destroy half the value? Okay, so maybe $460 was overkill and $10 was not enough. But if we compromise, but then you're still making PhBTC less fungible relative to BTC and *simultaneously* making them easier and more profitable to counterfeit.
tl;dr Physical coins as a medium of exchange accomplish one of two things. 1) Reinventing the problem that bitcoin solved in the first place--the double spend problem, or 2) evolution into a sort of physical side-chain which is less fungible than fiat or bitcoin. Failure to recognize this (or even listen to several people who try to tell you this) demonstrates a lack of education about bitcoin, and it's why people say you don't get it. Demands that "we need this" and threats to "advocate against widespread use of bitcoin" in place of suggestions, insights, or even meaningful consideration of consequences indicate a lacking in general education.

Maybe some more numbers will help. Let's pretend I have one of [these]( running and see what it costs presently costs me in electricity to mine 1 block (according to  but pick any other calculator if you prefer).
(And before you mention difficulty increases, keep in mind that mining pools don't make mining more or less efficient, they only make rewards smaller and more frequent.)
It runs at 300 GH per second. That means it will take almost 5 years to mine a block (at present difficulty), which costs:
$0.15 per kwh * .175 kw * 5 years * 365 days per year * 24 hours per day = $1149.75
Compared to the block reward,
25 BTC = $16250
That means about 7% of the reward goes to energy. And $0.15 per kwh isn't even particularly cheap energy.

That's tough. The reason that you scan their code is that you need their address to construct the transaction. They can't construct that transaction because they don't have your private key. You might be able to work out a system where you create the transaction and then they scan and broadcast it--but then you still have to work out how to get their address into your phone (as of today--you'd both be scanning something).


That works because Starbucks giftcards are a centralized system. They just need your account number, then they are authorized to credit and debit.

That would work to their disadvantage, since they would be giving up transaction fees. However, let's suppose they really do just want to watch the world burn.

Keep in mind they're using an incredible amount of resources to sustain this attack with no benefit except delaying confirmations. It won't last long.


True. We would likely notice very quickly what is going on and start rejecting blocks from the attacker.

It looks like a promising site! Here are some things I noticed that I thought could be better. Everything should be taken with the typical grain of salt.
1. A different font. The one you've got up is too reminiscent of comic sans, IMO. Comic sans has always been one of my least favorite things about dogecoin. And that monkey shipping banner is *way too big*. The monkey is actually bigger than your own mascot. It's confusing at first. Pick either the left or right column for social media, advertising, etc. Right now more than ever you want to showcase the products. As you have it, the auctions get *slightly* over 1/3 of the real estate. It's busy like Yahoo! instead of clean like Google. Guess which one of those companies I've never sent any money to ever.
2. If you're going to let people sell crypto, you should help out the buyers by giving them a current market exchange rate and calculating the seller's exchange rate. Right now someone's got Doge up for sale at .00000500 (over 500% of market value). But someone will probably buy it because they're not that good at math and see 3000 Doge for "only" 15 mBTC. Someone who knows better might buy it anyway to save signing up for an exchange, but you should take the opportunity to help actively inform customers. While we're at it, if you're going to allow people to sell crypto then you should just give crypto it's own section of the site. Computers, Electronics &amp; Electrical, Rare &amp; Collectables doesn't do the trick.
3. A well done introductory video might make you seem more trustworthy.
4. This site has some competition (cryptothrift, openbazaar). Is there an advantage that you have over these competitors that you can highlight?
5. It sounds like you're holding BTC in exchange for credits. You might have very good security practices otherwise, but creating a target like that for hackers is dangerous and *totally unnecessary*. Multisig: learn it, use it, love it.
6. See number 5. Yes. It's that important. Look into multisig.

First, I'm sorry, but I can't dance around the fact that this was a really dumb mistake and you will never see that money again. The mistake doesn't make you a dumb person, but not learning a good lesson would. I sincerely hope that anyone who ever reads your story gets to learn the easy way.
Bitcoin is not money to be played with. You *need* to have good security habits. If you're even the least bit unsure, **do more research**. The Bitcoin community is notoriously untrusting for a very good reason (in fact, fewer than you might expect will *assume* your story is true, and it likely won't be easy to *prove* that it is). This page looks professionally done at first glance, but [look closer](
1. They're buying **way** above any reputable internet exchange (excepting possibly localbitcoins). If it sounds too good to be true, then either you heard it wrong or it's too good to be true. Nobody's in the Bitcoin business to lose money.
2. The fee is impossibly low. Once again, say it with me... If it sounds too good to be true, then either you heard it wrong or it's too good to be true.
3. "Easy as One, Two, Three ..." for us to steal your money with Paypal! Let's talk about reversible transactions. Reversible means they can send you the money and then take it back. Most payment systems that are familiar and easy work this way--Paypal, credit cards, debit cards. One of (if not the) most common Bitcoin scams takes advantage of the fact that reversing confirmed Bitcoin transactions is computationally impossible.
4. It didn't work the first time and you did it again. This is like putting an extra $1 in the vending machine after it ate your first one. Except that it's a $450-$500 vending machine. Thankfully you didn't send them 2 more! Those properly familiar with the protocol will recognize that their claim about two transactions merging and needing to separate them is *entirely bogus*.
5. Adobe logo (?) next to a DONATE link (bitcoin address). Does your bank have a donation button on their webpage?
6. The title is IN RUSSIAN!
All of this is right on the front page. Here's some advice moving forward:
1. Look into paper wallets for any money that you can't afford to lose. Make several in small denominations with a password that you won't forget (might want to give it to someone trusted in case the unthinkable happens). Make backups stored in a separate location and only cash them in as needed.
2. Even though it only has spending money in it, make sure you have your software wallet backed up too. Ideally also in a different physical location. A hard drive can fail any time. And if you're really thinking the right way, then so can a fire. Keep an encrypted backup at work just in case--there are some great step by step guides out there.
3. Only use legitimate exchanges, services, and software (including browser extensions). If you have any doubt, search and ask if you don't find anything. You might get poked fun at a bit, but it's a lot better than donating your hard earned money to scammers.
4. Enable 2FA wherever you can and use a different password on every site (especially sites without 2FA). If you registered an account there, I hope you didn't use any password that's even similar to any of your other passwords. Password managers make using secure passwords much easier than you might think (admittedly not nearly as easy as using common passwords, but security doesn't come free). I like KeePass2, and there are alternatives.
Sorry for your loss, I wish you the best of luck in the future. Stay positive, it can happen to anyone once.

As the miners are chugging along transactions continue to come in. Miners add these transactions to a collection of yet-to-be-verified transactions we know as a transaction block. Every block has a number (known as it's height). The current height is over 300,000 and a new block is produced about once every 10 minutes.
Miners use the transactions from the block they're working on together with a piece of the previous block as a sort of starting point in a mathematical puzzle. As soon as someone solves the puzzle, the miners all start working on the next block trying to claim the next reward.
That puzzle is really cool because it can vary in difficulty. Every 2 weeks or so the network agrees to adjust the difficulty so that a new block will always take about 10 minutes regardless of how powerful the network is.
*The mined coins are just a transaction that the miner puts into the block they mined. It sends 25 (12.5 in a few years) bitcoin to whatever address they specify without needing any inputs.*
The miners are allowed to claim a block reward, but they can't cheat or break the rules because their work is always double-checked by the network. If they tried, someone would notice right away and their block would be deleted and forgotten (along with any reward).
Edit: this also explains why Satoshi (or anybody else in the world) can't just "give themselves bitcoins." The bitcoins would have to come from a transaction in a block. That block would be verified by the entire network and the fraudulent bitcoins would be detected immediately.

How so? And why would they need to be compatible?
I think perhaps you aren't *fully* understanding how mining and 51% attacks work... Let's suppose that I control 51% of the hashing power and have 100BTC at my disposal:
1. Buy 100BTC worth of ALT and wait for as many confirmations as are required. Let's call this transaction X and suppose that it occurred in block N.
2. Start my miners at work on an alternate blockchain. This new version begins at block N and does not include transaction X. Instead, it includes transaction Y which transfers those same 100BTC to a different address I control (this prevents transaction X from ever being re-broadcast and confirmed).
3. Since I have more hashing power than everyone else combined, I will build my blockchain faster and eventually will have one longer than the "real" blockchain. Once this happens...
4. Broadcast those blocks. Since my blockchain is longer, it will be accepted by the network and people will begin mining new blocks on my chain. Sell the ALT for 100BTC, so now I have 200BTC. Rinse and repeat.
There's no transferring of hashes required. As long as I have at least 10 tokens, I can execute step 3 without any single token generating 10/100 of the last blocks.

1. If the blockchain is gone there's no way to verify that the physical coins contain any bitcoin anyway.
2. Physical coins are not going to put even the tiniest dent in Bitcoin's scaling problem.
3. What if a coin isn't on the white list?
4. Physical bitcoins are not "recognizable". You could hope the recipient trusts you, but that kind of defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin.

You can't spend your bitcoin anywhere new after today's "announcement," but you may have more tools available for sending them. They would not (successfully) be able to impose the 30% fee on wallets (because people wouldn't code / use them).

Good for you?
Nobody's trying to tell you that you should put 0.5 BTC in a hot wallet. You are the one telling others that it is stupid to do so. All I'm saying is that if you can afford a 0.5 BTC loss and might spend that much in a day, then it's not all that stupid.
It's ridiculous to make almost any claim of the form "it's stupid to keep more than X bitcoin in a hot wallet". Most people have different circumstances than you do.

What you have are not good points, but obscure and highly improbable paranoia. You're trying to leverage these into a call to action supporting a currency which cannot work (for many reasons, none of which you've addressed).
A thread like this would likely be better received if you just spoke *against* the regulations imposed on the coin producer, rather than trying to convince people that bitcoin will collapse without physical coins. People generally like physical coins and bitcoin businesses, and generally dislike regulation. But you won't get anywhere telling people that they *need* physical coins (or even that they're particularly useful).

7 kajillion isn't a number, but if a cup of coffee is 7,000 bits, then it would be 700,000 satoshi's, or 7 millibits, or .007 bitcoins. I think "the common man" is perfectly capable of multiplying by 10.

Oh, boy.
1) and 2) Bitcoins are stored in what's called a wallet. Your wallet is actually a webpage or a piece of software. It keeps track of all of your addresses (used for receiving) and their corresponding private keys (used for spending). Electrum is a good beginner wallet. It's lightweight and easy to back up. My favorite web wallet would have to be Greenaddress.it. They have some additional security features using multisig transactions.
3) I have no idea. Good security is difficult to learn.
4) Your wallet handles that for you. Just pick a password.
5) Cold storage means putting your private keys on a medium that doesn't see the internet. This can be a piece of paper, or a flash drive stored in a safe deposit box. Again, it takes some learning, but it's the safest way to store bitcoin.

Keyloggers are still a vulnerability (especially for tech illiterate). Computers need to be backed up too and those backups are prone to failure as well.

Another altcoin. The fact that MS had a hand in development doesn't really make it more relevant. It's nice to see coins that do public good, but I'm not yet convinced that the resources consumed by bitcoin mining constitute a significant waste. I'm also not yet convinced that coins like Permacoin and Primecoin provide substantial benefit to the scientific community. Data storage is cheap and finding primes does not have a clear benefit (beyond satisfying our curiosity).

These are really the same question. The answer is basically forever. I remember reading somewhere that a computer using all of the sun's output for power would take longer than the age of the universe to calculate someone's private key.
However, calculating a private key through brute force is not the only way to obtain them. Weak passwords, hacked computers, keyloggers, malware, etc. all represent threats to your private key. Good security practices (i.e. cold storage) are what keep us safe from these threats.

Sure, but it doesn't help your point! If we assume that miners are rational then it must be the case that the total energy + equipment costs are **less** than $44.

Well, you did.
 &gt; &gt; Most of that $44 goes into equipment and profit.


That $44 per transaction is computed thusly (just compared to numbers on blockchain.info/stats and it works):
(25 BTC + transaction fees per block) * ($ per BTC) / (number of transactions per block)
Blockchain.info is not going out and checking electrical meters of all the miners.

GHash is going to produce some valid blocks, though. If *you* ignore those, then *you* are ignoring the blockchain. If *you* decline to propogate them, it won't stop any other nodes from getting them (remember, GHash has nodes too).
Perhaps you're suggesting a manual update which ignores all GHash blocks. That's a very serious action which would require proportional consideration and effort. And it would be kind of like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.

Let's suppose you are correct, and that mining a transaction costs $44 **in energy**. The math you quoted says that miners are rewarded $44 per transaction. So the block reward and transaction fees barely (if at all) cover their energy costs.
Where do their profits come from? How do they pay for the equipment?

There's your problem. Just because something is written doesn't mean it's worth reading.


There's a reason for that and it's not that Bitcoin is actively trying to exclude you. Credit card transactions are reversible and bitcoin transactions are not. That means after a sale you could potentially talk the card company into giving you your money back, but the seller would not be able to retrieve the bitcoin they sent. This is also the reason for all of the fees you paid.
If you want to trade in bitcoin, credit cards are not the way to go about it. And you are correct in saying that bitcoin is not for the average non-technical user. The same could have been said of the internet in 1995. It's not ready for mass adoption. It will be someday, but not today.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:03:48
I may have misunderstood your intention. What you're suggesting is essentially that merchants offer a discount for purchasing with bitcoin. I think that's a great suggestion, albeit unoriginal.
We can look at it as "I pay X + 0.0001 and merchant receives X" or as "I pay Y and merchant receives Y - 0.0001". It doesn't matter though because X + 0.0001 = Y. In the absence of a motivation to promote bitcoin--the merchants will tend to advertise the price as X instead of Y for the same reason that they tend to display prices before sales tax.

A man walks into a bar and half of his head is a giant orange. He sits down and orders a drink from an understandably confused bartender. After a while, the bartender's curiosity got the better of him. "Why is half of your head a giant orange?"
"That's quite a story," replied the man "you'll have to buy me another drink."
"Deal." said the bartender.
The man begins "I was walking down the beach when I stubbed my toe on something buried in the sand. When I dug it up and cleaned it off, I saw it was a lamp and to my surprise a genie emerged."
"Hold on now!" interrupts the bartender. "I didn't buy you that beer to hear a children's fairy tale."
"No, listen!" the man insists. "For my first wish I asked that I be made irresistible to all women."
"I find that quite unlikely" the bartender begins to argue, but as he looks around the bars he sees women gaping at him like he's a young Brad Pitt. "Okay..." he relents. "Go on."
"My next wish was that I would have a wallet with an unlimited supply of $100 bills."
"Well then, prove it!" the bartender exclaimed.
Sure enough, the man pulled out his wallet and littered the bar with $100 bills. Piles upon piles of them. The bartender stood with his jaw dropped in disbelief. "Okay, so what was your third wish?"
"I wished that half of my head was a giant orange."

Actually this is a misconception. First of all the buyer usually pays the transaction fee in the Bitcoin protocol. The buyer is the one sending the bitcoins, so he makes the transaction--finds the inputs, signs them, designates outputs (one of which is the miner fee).
The complaints you're seeing are a result of the fact that in order to transmit bitcoins, one must first convert fiat to bitcoin (around 1% fee), then transmit the bitcoins (almost free), then the receiver has to convert bitcoin back to fiat (again, around 1%). These are small, but remember: many fiat transactions can be done for free outside of bitcoin and both parties need to register with an exchange.

There are someday going to be 21 million bitcoins, which amounts to 210 quadrillion satoshis. If you consider 1 BTC to be the base unit, then no, it is not inflationary because you don't increase the supply of BTC by adding a decimal digit. If you consider the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin to be the base unit, then it still isn't inflationary because the satoshi doesn't lose value by adding a decimal digit.
There are ways to "make" bitcoin inflationary. For example, wallet developers could agree to use the base unit 1 Inflationcoin = 1 BTC * e^(0.03t), where t is measured in years after some date (probably the date and time of the genesis block). This would achieve 3% continuously compounded inflation (in the form of interest payed to holders). This may have some merit in that it could make some people feel better, but it wouldn't have any impact on the protocol or on the value of 1 BTC.
In my opinion, if we want consumer adoption then software should use the base unit $1 USD. Sure a wallet's dollar content will always be changing, but it would be much easier for the layman to understand (and the value will *generally* go up because the dollar is inflating while the bitcoins will eventually deflate).
**tl;dr** Units only matter from a psychological standpoint. Divisibility doesn't matter (in a discussion of inflation) because 21,000,000.00000000 = 21,000,000.000000000 = 21,000,000.0000000000

1. A bit is a little bit less than a doge. More precisely, it's 1 millionth of a bitcoin.
2. Colored coins are complicated, but essentially they let you keep track of property (physical or digital) on the blockchain.
2. I'm not sure what you mean by hate. There are a lot of people here that don't take doge very seriously, but that's not the same as hate. I think doge is a very important part of the cryptosociety. Dogecoin makes crypto accessible. Bitcoin is more focused on application at the moment.

It does include those costs, and that's exactly the problem. It doesn't take account of the fact that those costs are fixed.
When you say every transaction costs $44, it gives the impression that $44 worth of wasted energy goes into verifying each and every transaction. That's not true. Most of that $44 goes into equipment and profit.
You can argue that equipment and miner profits are wasteful, but I think that's a different argument. And I think those points will also apply to Permacoin (people will have to buy hard drives and they'll need to be incentivized to do so).

Sort of. First note that "bit" is not the same as "bitcoin" (which doesn't have a space). 0.000001 BTC = 1 bit. It's a little more than a doge.

Not everyone. Let's say there are 1,000,000 bitcoin users right now and they all donate. That means there's $6,000,000 to give away. When we give people $6 each, we run out of donation money after giving it to 1,000,000 people. We might double the amount of people who have bitcoin, but not nearly everyone will have it.
There will be three kinds of giveaway recipients and only one are the kind you want to reach. The first will sell them immediately (or *maybe* find a local merchant and buy a sandwich or some coffee), and not bother to buy more because it's not more convenient than fiat. The second kind will hold the 0.01 BTC for the foreseeable future believing it will make them rich. The kind of people you want to reach, those people that would use it and buy more, helping us to grow the economy--those are rare people.

If you're going to use the "people think in whole numbers" argument, I really think you ought to be arguing for satoshis.

It doesn't seem reasonable to try to convince someone you've never met they should change. It's a matter of preference.

You're absolutely right to be skeptical. Here's my interpretation:
I doubt that they would have bothered ammending approval guidlines to explicitly allow sending of anything other than cryptocurrency. At the very least, they would have known that they were using *extremely* misleading language. But on top of that--what else comes to mind? In app purchases earn them huge amounts of revenue, so transmitting gaming credits seems like an unlikely interpretation. Could it be something else?
My guess would be that they are in fact allowing Bitcoin. Doing so silently like this is really their only option if you think about it. If they brought it up at WWDC or even mentioned Bitcoin explicitly in the guidlines, there would have been headlines. They're accepting Bitcoin, but they aren't prepared to endorse it yet. This way they get all the positive attention and none of the negative attention (can you blame them?).

That figure is obtained by dividing the block reward + transaction fees by the number of transactions in a block. This is misleading because it disregards fixed equipment costs *and* assumes that miners make no profit.

In most of what I've read, one of the first things said about Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized blah blah blah. That seems to only be true in the sense that "It is not the case that there exists a **very small** group of people who can manipulate the protocol at a whim." (Which seems equally true of the USD, unless I'm mistaken and all decisions to print currency etc. really are made by just one guy that we're hoping is really smart. Please correct me if this is the case.)
Complete decentralization may be impossible for all I know. But at the very least I think it's fair to say that Bitcoin is not *fully* decentralized and such claims should not be so commonplace without disclaimer.

Because those are reversible transactions. If I sold you bitcoins with a credit card, you could in theory call your credit card company and reverse that transaction (and keep the bitcoins). Then the burden of proof would be on me to *prove* that I gave you bitcoin in return. This can actually be done, but some payment processors won't accept the proof and nobody wants to risk learning the hard way.

If you're talking about the address with the largest balance, you can find it [here]( If you're talking about the largest holder of bitcoin, it's probably Satoshi Nakamoto himself. He is suspected to have mined around 1,000,000 BTC (presently worth over half a billion dollars).

Total transaction volume for Silk Road was estimated around 9.5 million bitcoins. The gambling sites listed on blockchain.info's top 100 addresses account for another 7.8 million (until present). The aggregate total of all bitcoin transactions was around 37.1 million at the time of the Silk Road shutdown. I probably missed some volume here but we still aren't even at 50%. There's a long ways to go before we can really claim a "vast majority" but you're welcome to take a shot if you want to convince me with some actual numbers.
But that's not even the point. In reducing the protocol to its privacy features (which fiat currency shares and is demonstrably more popular with drug dealers), he's failing to recognize the potential of the technology. Bill Gates is not immune to cognitive dissonance. He's identified one part of the protocol that he doesn't like, and dismissing the whole thing.
I say that he doesn't understand Bitcoin because he didn't even think decentralization was worth mentioning. He mentions interest in "digital currency," but doesn't seem to fully grasp the problems associated with that concept. Unless we all agree to trust the "Bank of Microsoft" or he's sitting on a *second* solution to a well-known computer science problem - he doesn't have a currency that will work.
Bitcoin is only 5 years old. Think about any major technological breakthrough: cars, electricity, the telephone, computers, credit cards, the internet, e-mail - 5 years after inception none had really taken hold. It takes a great deal of work to build infrastructure.

You can either bring your desktop with you or bring your phone with you. But you'll need private keys (along with insanely-difficult-for-humans-but-easy-for-any-computer math) in order to complete a transaction. I don't think there's any getting around that.

Having a voice is not the same thing as having control. Decentralization is about who controls things.
There is a lot of trust being placed in the Bitcoin developers and mining pool operators. I'm not saying that trust is misplaced, in fact I'd guess that they are (at least mostly) extremely intelligent, competent, and honest people (but only because I haven't heard of them doing anything to indicate otherwise).
Is it impossible that one of them is clever enough to abuse that control in a way benefits themselves to the detriment of the users? I would like to think so, but I'm not convinced. (Even though I *am* convinced it's unlikely they *would* take such actions.)

That's a good point, and I'm glad to see alt-coins that do good things. If it's open source and decentralized, then I think it's got some great potential as an alt-coin. But that wasn't clarified in the article, so I'm still skeptical.

No. Checkdigits are built into every address to prevent this.
Here's an illustration of how checkdigits work. Suppose I want to communicate the 5 digit code 12345 to you (in this analogy, I am the bitcoin address and you are a wallet). I'll actually transmit a 6 digit code instead: 123455. I get the 6th digit by adding up the previous 5 and taking the remainder after dividing by 10.
Now let's say there was an error in communication and you received (or even mistakenly read) 122455. Notice how that 3 changed to a 2. You would recognize that this code is invalid because if it was valid, then the actual code is 12245, and the code I sent should have been 122454 according to the rule.
The check digits built into bitcoin addresses are even more sophisticated and resistant to more kinds of errors e.g. transposing two digits.

Suppose that 90% of the miners got together and decided this. So the next block, they go ahead and give themselves a 100 coin block reward instead of only collecting fees.
The problem is that when they broadcast that block, it will be instantly recognized by the nodes as invalid and discarded. Everything the miners do is checked.
By giving themselves those 100 coins, all they've really done is ensured that they won't get those coins **or** the transaction fees from that block.
Nodes are much easier to run, since they're just checking solutions instead of finding them. They're also responsible for distributing a block accross the network.
If someone was able to control a majority of the hashing power *and* a majority of the nodes, then really they'd just be mining a different coin.

There's a difference between a problem and a significant problem. E.g. the fact that BTC isn't accepted at my local gas station is a problem. The fact that the network might not be scaleable is a significant problem.

You still have not proposed a single solution or meaningful insight.


And how many of those coins have ever been circulated? Probably none. Casascius was doing business with collectors. People like to collect things.


I understand that you're making a point. I'm telling you that it isn't going to happen and more importantly you aren't going to convince anyone else that it is. If physical coins became a common medium of exchange, white listing would be ineffective. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Since it won't happen (more precisely since nobody believes it will happen), your "point" is pointless.




I'm not saying there's no solution. I'm saying that physical bitcoins are not a solution.


My point depends on good counterfeiting countermeasures a) not being free, and b) not being perfect. Do you have a free counterfeiting measure in mind? I've got one that's almost free, but you'll have to do some reading. It's called the block chain. Maybe you've got a perfect one in mind. If so you will likely be considered for a Nobel prize. But, you still haven't addressed the problem of how these physical coins will be valued.


So, what, gathering support is your premise? Do you know what an argument is? I don't think anybody in this thread has tried to tell you physical bitcoins should be illegal. We're just explaining that they are not a viable substitute for the block chain. Your "argument" hinges on plugging your ears and yelling "lalalalala".


Wise words, truly. Now I almost believe you.


No, you "totally" don't. If you did you would not still be insisting that physical bitcoins will be a viable means for exchange. Part of being "educated" is being able to admit that you don't know *everything*. You sound more like a teenager than an educated adult.


Call it whatever you want. It still isn't constructive in the least to keep repeating it at people who don't believe you.


Again. Call it a banana split if you want to--the point is that it accomplishes nothing. You are not saving anyone from starvation, suicide, or political violence. You are having a temper tantrum on the internet because you can't see what's been put in front of your face.


Oh, are we doing tautologies now? Still not constructive.


Still not a single suggestion on how to make physical bitcoins work as a currency. Surprise, surprise.

What you're asking is essentially for merchants to offer discounts for sales in bitcoin. Let's imagine we're buying something for 1.0 bitcoin.
Merchant pays the fee: customer pays 1.0000 bitcoin and merchant receives .9999 bitcoin.
Customer pays the fee: customer pays 1.0001 bitcoin and merchant receives 1.000 bitcoin.
The problem is the merchant may have costs which are not affected by whether or not payment is made in bitcoin. A more likely outcome would be that the merchant raises his price to 1.0001 bitcoin so the customer pays that and the merchant still receives their 1.0000 bitcoin.
Fees are not that big of a deal. They're typically around $0.01, and get computed automatically.

I tend to think they worded it a little bit vaguely so it wouldn't be interpreted as an endorsement of crypto-currency (something they *definitely* want to avoid).

But people's wallet's won't check those "mining nodes" to get their wallet balances. They will check the bitcoin nodes.
Miners giving themselves extra bitcoin would be like playing a game of pretend. Sure, they can say they have all the bitcoins in the world if they want to. But when they try to spend them, the recipient will recognize them as obviously fake.

No, I'm distinguishing between fixed costs and costs. Granted, not in the most articulate way possible. The assertion is that because a miner is rewarded (on average) $44 per transaction, it must require about that much in energy to verify each transaction. That simply isn't true. First of all miners make a profit. More importantly, they have to cover their fixed costs.
The cost per transaction will taper as the network grows and as ASICs reach the limits of hashing power. It will *eventually* approach the amount of energy required to verify each transaction, but we're not there yet.

The only way to make such a device "unforgeable" as you suggest would be to make the hologram stickers prohibitively expensive to produce (more than the bitcoin on the coin). As the price of bitcoin increases, that expense would have to go up as well. As it stands, hologram stickers do not cost as much as a bitcoin. They can be custom designed and ordered on the internet (for well under $1 if you order in the right quantities--which any serious forger would gladly do).
More importantly: since so much of the value would need to go into producing the hologram sticker, that needs to be taken into account when selling, buying, or exchanging the coins. *You're buying and trading fancy stickers, not bitcoin. And the same goes for any other mechanism designed to make the coins difficult to counterfeit.*
Physical bitcoins are a novelty that contribute nothing to the ecosystem. If I found one locked away in a safe someday I might get excited about it, but if someone tried to buy something from me using one, I'd send them on their way.

I hope you realize that BTC can be moved off of physical coins. If this happens before we lose access to the blockchain, then a lot of fraud will take place.


We could say the same thing about fiat. *The scaling problem is solved!* Moreover, I'd be willing to bet that a *vast* majority of bitcoin transactions are not between two parties who are standing right next to each other.


Then the trust is already destroyed because it's *incredibly easy* to move bitcoin off of a physical coin.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:50:38
On the first quote I completely agree with you. Tumblers can eradicate the connection between coins and their owners and the authors seem ignorant of that fact (though in their defense it is an old article by bitcoin standards). Can a single transaction reference outputs to multiple addresses? Obviously they *need* to reference multiple transactions, but that's different.
The authors define coin tainting quite imprecisely (with an example). I *think* they mean to say that a coin is "tainted" when its owner becomes known. The example they reference describes a situation where Bitcoin users begin refusing coins which originate from a particular address (is it even possible to refuse coins?) thus devaluing the perhaps-legitimately-obtained BTC. In any case, I'm not sure about the details of how the FBI brought down Silk Road so I can't speak to the accuracy. They seem to offer up as evidence the fact that the FBI seized the owners BTC (which is just plain silly).

As has already pointed out, "mad generals problem" probably isn't the best name but this deserves attention regardless.
I wish the Bitcoin foundation would consider releasing some kind of PSA stating "Bitcoin is ready for the public to play with small amounts (on the order of $10-$100 via Mycelium or Localbitcoins). But unless you're a security expert *investing* in Bitcoin is a bad idea."
The general public are getting mixed messages and it's going to hurt us in the long run. There are a thousand videos out there about how easy it is to get started with bitcoin, but the only words of caution are coming from haters and doubters.
It's not easy (yet). Let's not give people the impression that they can jump right in.
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:36:35
Oh, that's a fact. It's their discretion and they aren't asking for input.
However, if they *didn't* mean crypto, then why call them "virtual currencies"? Even the authors would have to acknowledge that's misleading if they really meant farmville points.
Also, why would they let people trade their farmville points? They make 30% on those sales. Allowing people to trade them would be cutting a huge hole in that particular source of revenue.
That might be the direction they're going. Just seems like it would be kind of a strange move.
