 Satoshi did the world a favor. People like him power the progress!

 The more sophisticated technology becomes, the more resources and power it requires – which, in its turn, causes more harm.

 I'm not quite sure if it's safe when there's no KYC policy. Yeah, it could be very annoying when exchanges like CEX (r/ ask for a lot of documents, but the level of security is respective. So, it should be worth the cost.

 The ignorance is the base for bans. And it happens not only in California, but many countries do so. Bitcoin blockchain is a much more transparent system than any other funding systems, and all donations there are trackable.

 I totally agree with the list. Blockchain is able to change the most boring aspects of our lives. With the proper implementation, it’s the answer to many problems. Blockchain offers solutions of transparency, reliability, security, interaction and excludes human factor. And now imagine how many spheres can be improved by this technology! Especially it concerns the fossilized financial system that wasn’t renovated from the Middle Ages. Finally, the world found the innovative technology equal to modernity.

 I think that no graphs can reflect the long-term price tendency of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular due to its highly speculated nature. It is impossible to create one equation capable to include all the variables that impact the crypto market and investors’ behavior. As for me, the worst correction of cryptocurrencies has passed, and soon we will see the uptrend.

 We can see that traditional banking system is far from ideal. Hope we will get rid of banks with the help of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

 General decrease in usage lessens Bitcoin fees. Also, Segwit contributes to lower fees. However, some people consider that the role of Segwit is overestimated at the moment and the reduction of fees is related to the batch processing. Of course, low fees are profitable for Bitcoin users, but not for miners.

It is difficult not to notice such personalities like Roger Ver and Craig Wright. While some people are notable in the crypto world due to their contribution to the industry, these ones gain popularitry because of their nasty reputation.

 I use BitGo wallet. It provides 3-of-3 authorizers to sign a transaction. The multisig address with Bitgo can be integrated along with the hardware wallet, but I don't have it and prefer secure cold wallet on CEX. Besides, there are many advantages of keeping your crypto on the exchange.

Any innovative thing meets criticism. I don’t know if there is any reason to convince people with a negative attitude towards crypto. If they don't understand what cryptocurrency is and what benefits it brings, no one will change their mind.

I think it shouldn’t be the SFC to decide who is allowed to invest in cryptocurrency and who is not. Cryptocurrency doesn’t require any regulations to develop and grow. Those who stated that the crypto world needs regulations for stability can see how that was wrong.

 Nice cyberpunk pic. Why only bitcoin sign billboards? A city full of advertisements is so true. Looks like a dystopian future, closer to 2050.
