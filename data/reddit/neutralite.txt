The irony of this comment gave me a good laugh.

Waiting for to come in and explain how this is somehow all misinformation and Danny is the greatest most misunderstood CEO of all-time...

You've got to be joking. You are making ridiculously extraordinary claims in every post where I see you defending Danny. Can you post some kind of EVIDENCE that he's a competent CEO?
Also, if MP troll accounts are everywhere as you claim, can you post a topic showing evidence that this exists? Such a thing is strictly against Reddit rules, and if you could prove it was happening these accounts would be banned by Reddit administrators from the entire site.
I have a feeling you can't do either of the two above and you're just going to continue spewing your stupid bullshit all over N&amp;B threads, thus making you part of the problem.

A lot.

Why the hell would I sell my shares for $20? I'd rather just hope for a miracle. 
The irony of calling me a "weak minded fool" is incredible considering the MOUNTAIN of evidence suggesting every investor was conned. I expected this kind of response from you, I'm just hoping you wake up after enough people give you a verbal throttling because right now you're just part of the fucking problem.

I've seen so much of your fucking bullshit here over the last several weeks that I'm honestly starting to believe you're either a troll account or Danny himself. 
Face the facts: Danny is a con artist who stole all investors money. This is coming from someone who had over 1000 shares of N&amp;amp;B. There is no good news coming because no one would want to touch this with a 10ft pole. Danny took your money and used it to help pay for transporting his Bentley. 
Rather than wasting your energy posting delusions from your fantasy dream world, redirect that energy towards bringing Danny to justice.
