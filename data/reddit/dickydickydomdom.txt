Any chance they could look at the fee algorithm? 
I bought some coin during December, at a point where roughly 130sat/byte would probably get you in the next block. And 200 would have been slightly overkill.
The fee paid to the miners was around 900, which is absurd.
It's all well and good implementing Segwit, and I thank them for doing this. But they're still massively overpaying and charging the users for it.

Opening and closing channels will be on chain, so that's where the fees are. Once it's open you can transact again and again with anyone your channel can reach on the network.

Stop shouting. Calm down. Take your time.
The answer is both. You put the receive address the ledger gives into the send box on gdax. 
Learn some of the basics of how bitcoin works. You've done no research and are expecting everyone else to pick up the slack.
Send a small amount first and watch it work. Then send a larger amount. It's normal for the ledger to give you a different receiving address each time after one address is used.

If Coinbase's traffic is as much as people think/say it is, then Coinbase enabling Segwit will actually affect the network as a whole.

I use it as my hot wallet. It's been a little glitchy at times, crashing in background when I'm not using it, and one time it forgot about a transaction it sent which had a low fee so haden't yet confirmed. But that's about it.
The important stuff works, and they take privacy very seriously (so much so, I'd check the settings if I were you after installing to turn off some of them to save on transaction fees) and that's enough for a hot wallet in my view.

It won't. They'll just 'mine' more and more Petrocoin until the supply massively outstrips the actual reserves they have. Nobody will trust it and it'll be worthless.
Fiat isn't really the issue here. Venezuela has it's own currency which they fully control, they have just printed it into oblivion. Unless they have learned that lesson they will continue to allow history to repeat itself with their crypto as well. 
Venezuela needs a complete change in leadership and direction, that's the only thing that has a chance of fixing this. A lot more blood will be spilled and many thousands die of starvation and preventable illnesses before this happens.
I really hope I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:14:19


Yes it is. 


Not in *real time*. You need to check that nobody is transmitting a previous state. Given that each transaction is time locked you only need to check 'often enough', at certain points when it makes sense to check. At which point if you detect cheating you simply transmit your countermeasure and you're done.
You absolutely do not need to be checking every half second 24/7. The app does not need to be in the foreground to do this. The parent commenter I was responding to was lying. And yes, it's that simple. 
Odds are wallet providers may provide a service to do this for you, much like many wallet providers give existing services already to prevent the need to run your own node, such as Electrum.
And before you scream 'that's not trustless! That's a bank!' then obviously you're not using a mobile wallet then so you already know to run your own node and to how to transact trustlessly.  Everyone gets their own solution, just as they do now.
This is FUD, nothing more.

Tap the sat/byte text and you can override it with a manual value.
Check  to see which transactions are actually clearing and set your fee appropriately.

How many people could run a node with 1gb blocks? Could you? I couldn't. 1gb, every ten minutes, forever. I doubt I have a system that could even process 1gb blocks, let alone store them.
So we'll have a handful of rich people running the software that the rest of us rely on to transact and we need to hope they are acting honestly and have my best interests at heart. At that point we're back to square one and may as well go back to the banking system. To me that's not an option. 
Decentralisation is super important to Bitcoin, or at least I feel it's important anyway. Without decentralisation we're right back to square one and there is no point in doing any of this. May as well sell all the bitcoin I have and buy fiat. 
Just because fees are a bit higher than we'd like right now doesn't mean we should throw away one of the key ingredients of bitcoin just to save a few bucks. We need to be smarter than that.
This time next year none of this 'block size' nonsense will matter.

A lot of FUDoids out there as well, such as the one I debunked. Be careful. 


Probably. I'll answer with a counter question: what happens when a router which is routing traffic on the Internet goes offline? This happens *all the time* and most of the time you have no idea. The Internet just routes around the brokenness. Lightning network will do the same thing. *worst case scenario* you'll have to transmit the latest state to the blockchain and wait for the time lock to hit before it'll be included in a block, typically 30 days. Odds are that will be rare in practice.
Really smart people have been working on the lightning protocol for *years* now. Through all the drama, the fud, the shills, they have been working tirelessly on this system. Odds are they have thought of everything you have. Very likely they have found things that you are I don't really understand but they still found a fix for. 
Lighting network is finally going to get us bitcoin coffee, without everyone having to store your payment on their hard drive forever. This will be the best coffee you ever had. It will confirm almost instantly (first time I used the starblocks demo it genuinely finished before I looked up from my phone) and it'll be super cheap. And if someone tries to rip you off, the blockchain will have your back. 
It's time to get excited.

With that out of the way, you massively overpaid on fees at 910.722 sat/B. You could easily get away with 120 sat/B as I type this, or maybe 200ish if you're in a hurry.
Get a better wallet. One that allows you to override the fee with one of your choosing (and allows it to be replaced or 'bumped' after you've sent it, in case you screw up and pick a fee that's too low) and preferably one that uses Segwit as you then get a 'discount' when you sent anything, making it slightly cheaper still.

I'm keen to not use a database if that's possible, and just query the node itself each time through RPC (and I'm assuming the RPC calls exist to do this). A database obviously makes much more sense if the explorer is public facing, but mine won't be.

Your sat/byte still needs to be competitive with regular transactions, but the space used is smaller, so you pay less overall.

@_date: 2017-12-26 18:36:23


Uhhh, sort of. Addresses can start with a bc1 or a 3.
Think of the 3 format as a 'compatibility' option. bc1 isn't supported by everything yet so using the 3 format will work with everything in the meantime.
Electrum have made the odd decision of only allowing either legacy 1something addresses or the segwit bc1something addresses, but not the segwit 3something addresses.
If you have Android, you can set up a wallet on samourai wallet, and then import the recovery seed into Electrum. 
Be sure to tick the BIP39 and 'Extend this seed' options. Put in your 12 words (not the passphrase yet), then put the passphrase you chose in samourai into the *next* screen, and then set the derivation to m/49'/0'/0' set a password if you like.
And then, if by magic, Electrum will now generate 3Something compatable segwit addresses. And as a added bonus you can also use your mobile phone to transact with as well!
**Back up your 12 words alongside your passphrase**


If you are **sending** from a Segwit address, you get the discount. Doesn't matter where it's going, just where it came from :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:26:06
Bitcoin doesn't work like that.
It doesn't matter how much you move, it matters how much space you take up. If you're sending from one address to one address, that's the same amount of space regardless of moving $5 or $5m. The fee would be the same on both transactions.
That's just the way things are right now. It'll get better in the future, but as it stands, the fees are too high for 3 sat/byte transactions to clear.

It could absolutely have LN with a malleability fix. It doesn't have to be Segwit, it could be some other type of fix. Technically they could have it right now without the fix, but as you say that's not super practical. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:37:18
You say that, but I think someone is simply retransmitting old transactions.
I have a 80something sat/byte transaction waiting confirmation. As I said, low fee, I'm in no hurry for that one.
However, it wasn't appearing on blockchain.info yesterday and wasn't appearing all week. Even my client had forgotten about it, but it is there this morning. But according to blockchain.info, I sent it last night, which I didn't, I sent it a few days ago.
I think some people are running nodes with large mempools and maybe even retransmitting transactions.
I don't think this is spam, I think it's just old transactions. Which would explain the odd increases in the mempool of the lower fee transactions and might explain why the total is always full, but the pattern of what is in there has shifted.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:08:30
If you have coinbase you already have a gdax account. Use that for lower fees. See YouTube for tutorials.

Either you sent the transaction or you didn't. Mycelium doesn't just move money around on a whim for no reason. The vast majority of wallets are HD wallets and I've never heard of that behavior.
Can you provide the TXID or source/destination address of the transaction in question?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:59:36
Thank you for this.
It doesn't look like you offer service in my country so unfortunately I'm forced to pass.
As an expansion of this idea, there could even be a weekend option: send the week's transactions on a Saturday at 1am or something. Promise it will be confirmed by Sunday midnight with small replace by fee bumps throughout the weekend to get it confirmed.
The transaction would be huge and possibly may turn expensive with the fee bumping, but it's just one transaction and not lots of little ones so is probably a net saving and helps the network a little bit in the meantime.
This would be ideal for users who are wanting to top up a cold wallet they are holding for a few years as a few days really doesn't matter in that context.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:02:12
So what's the difference, other than Segwit, that Bitcoin has and Bcash does not have that makes LN impossible on Bcash?
My understanding that it was just a malleability fix that was required, that Segwit provided, but the fix could be implemented in other ways if needed. Such as a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:03:30
This is a common misconception (to be fair, I thought the same at first).
Exchanges absolutely can and probably will use LN. At least, the responsible ones will. Some are still not using Segwit and/or batching which is just absurd to me at this stage in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:48:24

I suggest you use Electrum *on your desktop* to import your mycelium recovery seed into. If my hunch is right Electrum won't see this transaction and will allow you to double spend.
Send everything to a new receiving address (either a new wallet on your phone or a new receiving address if you are sure you've not been hacked). Use a decent fee (around 120sat/byte currently, don't trust Electrum as it *always* overestimates, put it in yourself by hand).
This might be a good time to use a segwit enabled wallet if that's important to you. Samourai does this, but turn off some of the privacy options (untick "Receive change to like-typed outputs" and untick "spend using BIP126") as these will both add fees when you transact and in my view are pointless options.
And for God's sake ensure you download the proper Electrum client and not some trojan fake version and use it on a computer you can trust.
It's going to cost a bit in fees unfortunately, but I personally would do it for piece of mind, to be sure.
Make sure you do proper backups on any new recovery seeds, if applicable. **Triple check everything you do before you press that send button in every case**

It makes a difference, that's for sure. I don't know enough to tell you how much of a difference, I'm not smart enough to know if I'm honest. 8mb blocks doesn't mean eight times the traffic, of course, but it would definitely make it worse.
Critically, my node also has to serve the same data to other peers, up to 300 of them until I dropped it down to 25. 300 other peers could be asking for the blocks, history as they are syncing, as well as mempool and other bits and pieces you mentioned.
And, crucially, the mempool would have to keep being transmitted and shunted around as the backlog builds up and parts of the mempool get dropped and replaced as the networks demands on my node ebbs and flows. 8mb blocks will become full on Bitcoin very quickly and we'll be here again, with full blocks, full mempool, and a shitload of extra bandwidth to deal with.
I touched on this to another redditor yesterday who's math was *way* off: 
Even worse if some asshole created node software that just kept syncing and syncing and syncing, to attack the network, and maybe spammed the network with transactions that are hard to process, my CPU might not even keep up, let alone my connection.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:06:48
Electrum has a nice import wizard. Just be very sure you've downloaded the real deal and not some fake version that'll steal your coins, 'cos that would suck.

The fee you've paid is 3.129 sat/B

Actually I have an ulterior motive. Promise not to tell? Okay.
So I have a ledger nano s. If I use the chrome app they give us, I have to trust their node. I do trust them, but that's not the bitcoin way. That's not 'doing it properly'. 
So I can use electrum. But I'm still trusting other nodes. But, I can setup an electrum server which runs on my own node. Now we're talking! So apparently I have to reindex, this should finish as I sleep tonight. Then I can transact, using my hardware wallet, on my node only. Great.
But I often use blockchain.info's features to search addresses, transactions etc. But again, I'm trusting, not verifying. What if I could have blockchain.info's features, running on my own node? What if I had a browser extension that rewrote urls I click on reddit or whatever that queried my own little version of blockchain.info that ran on my node, on my lan?
What if I could have a website like  but again, powered by my own node?
I have no idea how difficult this would be to implement, but I'm damn well giving it a go!

@_date: 2017-12-23 12:52:59
This is where the 'rbf' (replace by fee) portion of my idea comes into play. You can use it to nudge the fee up bit by bit until the network takes it. Many wallets support this feature (if you have ever used electrum, this is what the 'replaceable' option means) so you can do it yourself if needed.
So it will confirm eventually, and you/the exchange will pay the smallest fee in order to do it. In theory.

@_date: 2017-12-26 09:30:44
Not strictly true.
The nodes 'tend to drop the transaction' after 2 weeks. But that's no guarantee. One the transaction is out there, it can be retransmitted and go back into the mempool. You or I could do that, you're only transmitting the signed data, the transaction doesn't have to come from us.
I've had a transaction drop this week, and it magically appears again yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:13:27
How many times do we have to see Coinbase/GDAX rip people off and completely ignore any and all lines of support before people wake up and STOP using them and STOP recommending them? 
It was bad enough that they supported the Segwit2x attack, expecting everyone else to upgrade whilst not even bothering to implement Segwit and batching themselves (expecting the community to 'upgrade' so they get cheaper transactions whilst they literally do nothing) but the support is **abysmal**.
Time and time again we're being warned that if anything goes wrong, which it will at some point you **will** be ignored by 'support'. They'll **never** get back to you and until you threaten them with actual legal action nothing will happen because they are perfectly content to shit on you and the wider Bitcoin network because that's the cheapest option.
**Stop using Coinbase, everyone right now. Stop using Coinbase.** We see these posts **every fucking week** on this sub and yet people are still using them. **Stop using coinbase, do not recommend them to friends. Tell any friends that you have recommended to close their account.** I can't believe I'm agreeing with Bank of America on this one. That's how bad things are.
With the countless warnings of this nature we are seeing here, you have zero excuse to keep using them. Wake the fuck up, or shut the fuck up when they rip you off. It **will** happen eventually. I will be personally down voting the next 'upvote for visibility because Coinbase ripped me off' post I see and every one after that (I did upvote this one) as apparently people might actually have to lose money permanently to get the message. 
OP, in terms of practical advice as this stage other than the 'I told you so' message. Raise another ticket on the 2nd, when everyone is back at work. Give them 7 days to resolve the matter to your satisfaction. Call them every day and demand a resolution by the 9th. They'll ignore you again. Go to a lawyer, and get the lawyer to write them a nice letter, referencing all of your ticket numbers so far, with the instruction that you intend to take legal action if not resolved in a reasonable amount of time. Now it'll actually cost them money they might actually respond.
Coinbase are a cancer on Bitcoin and they need to be removed. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:06:22
The network fees are high right now, no getting away from it.
Unfortunately the majority of exchanges are massively overpaying in order to get the transaction confirmed by the Bitcoin network super quickly. This is dumb, but it's just the way it is.
I guess they consider the fees to be easier to deal with than the "why did my bitcoin take several hours to confirm?" support tickets.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:55:55


No. Confirmations is the entire point. 0 Confirmation = you don't have your money yet and there is no guarantee you will have your money at all.

@_date: 2017-12-26 09:37:27
You have much to learn :)


No. Segwit is an enabler for LN to run on the Bitcoin network. But it's two seperate things. Segwit is ready to rock and roll right now. LN is being worked on and requires segwit.
Segwit is the road, LN are the cars. We can currently walk on the road, but when the cars are built it's going to be much faster. If that analogy helps I'm unsure.
As a side effect, and this is purely a side effect (and was a comprise from Core actually, this didn't need to be done in all honesty) Segwit *just so happens* to also make the blocks bigger as it gets used. Less of your transactions 'count' towards the fee calculation. The more people use Segwit, the less space 'counts' towards the 1mb, and the larger the blocks get. Up to around 2ish MB.


It's not stuck behind anything other than the human effort and time needed to get it finished. And that work isn't something Bitcoin Core are a part of (not directly anyway). This is complicated shit and money is on the line. They are obviously very keen to get it 'right first time'. There are live LN channels on the Bitcoin main network right now, but I'm certainly not brave enough to use them just yet.
Analogy: The Core people are making the roads smoother and safer to use. The LN people are building the cars and are currently working on making it so the [front doesn't fall off](

It's the transactions that have been broadcast, but not yet added to the blockchain. The 'backlog' if you will.
However, there is no consensus on the mempool; one node may have different stuff in it than another. But it's a good indication for a rough idea of the state of play.

I know. Sorry I'm not as clued up on this as you are. Please bear with me and give me a bit more of your time. I am trying to understand this. I know helping the uninformed can be draining.


So this is probably the main part of what I'm trying to understand. Segwit allows this, great. But is Segwit literally the **only** way to do this? Can this be achieved by some other method that Bcash could implement which isn't Segwit?
What I'm trying to understand is if Bcash will magically get this fix and be able to join LN as well. I think politically Segwit isn't an option for them, so I'm pondering if they could do this as a separate hard fork which is technically different but achieves the same goals to allow LN to work.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:59:10
This entire post makes no sense.
Unless you have massive collusion between ALL the miners to switch off their miners in certain circumstances than your conclusion simply doesn't make sense. And if you're asserting such a claim you'd better damn well have some evidence. And no, the mempool is not evidence.
Plus many miners pay for the electricity in advance. They are paying regardless of the miners working or not.
Bitcoin blocks are averaged to be one every 10 minutes. But there is an element of luck there. It's *always* been this way. We've always had some blocks that take 40 minutes to find, some that take 2 minutes to find. Nature of the beast.
Your claim just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

@_date: 2017-12-26 09:19:04


Higher than I'd like, I agree. However, the blockchain is a limited resource. Everyone wants to use it, so demand is high, but the supply is one block per 10 minutes. We are getting smarter with Segwit and the push for exchanges to wake up and actually use batching and Segwit to make it better for everyone. We still have the possibility of Schnoor signatures helping things along as well, once that becomes live.


Bitcoin is small. It's a small little fishing boat in a massive ocean of money. It's easy for it to get rocked by the waves. That's just the nature of the beast right now. Either you enjoy the rush of the ride, or you become seasick.

I'm glad you get it because the parent commenter you respond to doesn't get it. The argument used is fundamentally flawed.
If I were buying one off item from a store, such as a furniture store because I just moved, I could still use LN. My channel would be connected to someone else, who would connect to someone else, someone else, someone else, who eventually connected to the furniture store.
I don't have to open a new channel for each recipient, I don't have to even close a channel every month or whatever, it can stay open for however long I like (although I'm actually unsure about the technicals on the last point, still learning myself). As long as people stay connected, it'll route through them and do it's thing. No need for a Bitcoin Bank.
Think of it like this: my pc is acting up. You tell me to install team viewer, give over a code, and then you can connect and do the thing to fix it. Does your pc and my pc have to have a cable directly between them? Of course not, the signals go through a bunch of routers and switches and whatnot and the signals reach the destination. Sure, it would be *faster* with the one cable, but not exactly practical. So you trade a bit of latency for the convenience of the Internet doing the heavy lifting for you.
This shit is a bit complicated. Just like bitcoin is. But it is a very awesome part of the scaling solution once it 'clicks' into place. You don't have to know 100%, but knowing the high level theory helps a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:33:03
So that's my point from the start. They *could* join in on LN *if* they implement the same fixes that Bitcoin now has with Segwit, even if that means they produce something functionally the same as Segwit, but don't call it Segwit.
I think the confusion has come from me thinking it was *just* malleability.
I could genuinely see a lot of political push-back from the 'community' if Segwit was implemented. There seems to be a mouth frothing hatred for something just because they have been told to hate it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:34:22
Yeah that's being worked on, as you're probably aware.
Just increasing the block size and/or frequency would help a little in the short term (so Segwit helps there, just needs more adoption really) but it's no long term solution.
Andreas does a great job of explaining it here:  it's half an hour long but well worth a watch.

They simply did exactly what they planned to do, and told us they would do ahead of time. It's that simple.

And well done for sticking to the tough job of wading through the bullshit.
When I first started using Bitcoin, I used to be a big blocker ("8mb is **nothing** what the hell? Why can't we just have 8mb now and be done with it for 5 years"). 
It took time for me to realize the downsides of going that direction. This *really* kicked in when I started running a node and my bandwidth went through the roof, let alone the hard drive and processing resources used up.
I used to subscribe to the 'other' sub as well, as I wanted a balanced view. But even when I was a big blocker, I just couldn't stand it. It's literally the worst community I have ever found online. I'm including 4chan, in that, the lot. Every sub or site I've been curious enough to peek into, that one was genuinely the worst. There is just so much hate filled misinformation and blatant propaganda in there that I just couldn't wade through the crap to get to the very small nuggets of truth. And even then, I couldn't filter the truth from the bullshit. That place is an embarrassment and frankly they should be ashamed of themselves. It's not even a Bitcoin sub anymore; that's how far it's fallen.
is not perfect, far from it. But holy hell it's nice not to read "north corea unusable crippleCoin BSegShit blockstream coin" with blatant lies and fabrications *every other post*, it's draining, it's exhausting, it's the kind of crap pulled last year and it's the kind of crap you only believe if you really really want to.

This is very low. **But don't wait** - if you are under attack then the attack may notice his/her mistake and then up the fee to get it confirmed. Double spend those bad boys into a fresh wallet that you control with a 200sat/byte fee or something to get it shifted straight away.

I'm more interested in making mining decentralized.
I want a quiet, efficient, not-too-power-hungry miner that I can have in my study room next to my PC server. **Max** price of $1,200 to purchase, **with** PSU, preferably less. The TH/s rate doesn't matter, as long as it's competitive with the power usage it's sucking down. No more than say 1000 watts of power; what a high end PC would use, maybe a little less, 600-800 watts or so would be better.
And it needs to look clean: power cable in the back, network cable in the back, maybe a LED or two to let me know everything is okay. It doesn't have to look pretty, or 'designer', just clean, no wires *everywhere* like many miners currently have. The Avalons seem to be good for this.
I don't care about making mega money with this thing. I want to mine to help the network, and if I break even that's great, but it's not a requirement.
Bitmain's Antminer R4 comes *close*. But it's fugly, and no longer in production by the looks of it, so difficult to get hold of without paying an absurd amount of money from scalpers
It seems no manufacturer is wanting to target me. Pity :(

Bitcoin is **massively undervalued** in my opinion. And I mean massively.
Yes, it can move Bitcoin around from point A to B, just like it could 5 years ago. Except now we have to bid for space on the blockchain. This is an expected growing pain and is actually only temporary.
However, Bitcoin is proper, true "I don't give a fuck" money. It doesn't care if you're black, brown, white, pink, yellow or blue skinned. It doesn't care if you are a multimillionaire or a poor farmer. You transmit your transaction and it'll treat you just the same as anyone else.
Bitcoin won't inflate itself to pay for another war in Iraq, it won't compromise itself. It'll do it's thing and it doesn't give a fuck if you like it or not.
Everyone makes noise about the fees and price or whatever, but they are missing the point in my opinion. Bitcoin is *proper money*, and the world is still not aware of that just yet, this is a fundamental shift in the way that humans will do this whole "money thing" that we've historically been so shit at. This is potentially a massive game changer for everyone, forever.
So yeah, Bitcoin is undervalued in my opinion. But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong. I hope I'm not.

Yes. The blockchain is a finite resource. If the fee was fixed, we'd ultimately end up with nothing more than a queuing system as everyone would pay the same and take their place in line.
If I had a couple of million to attack bitcoin with (which is *nothing* to people who want to do Bitcoin harm), I would easily be able to clog up the network by constantly sending money to myself, and you'd have to wait in line. And wait, and wait, and wait...
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:04:20
The idea is to keep a block coming in roughly every ten minutes.
If more machines are guessing the correct answer to the math problem, odds are it will be found quicker, so the problem has to be made harder to balance things out.
This keeps everything stable as well as making it more difficult for a malicious actor to censor transactions or whatever.
A clever system when you think about it.

There is no consensus on the mempool.
There is zero guarantee that the transactions I see are the same ones you/blockchain.info see. On the contrary, it's very unlikely, especially if one of us has changed our configuration files away from the default.

Quoting $ for fees is misleading. Bitcoin doesn't care about dollars, just satoshis per byte. It has no concept of $, that's something we assign to it. That's on us, not Bitcoin.
So the bigger the transaction, the more it costs in satoshis and therefore the more it costs in $ as well.
This transaction is very small. One input, one output. But OP has chosen a small sat/byte number, hence it's stuck. OP need to change that to around 100-120 sat/byte and it'll go through in a timely fashion, so just over $3ish by your math, it doesn't need to be $10 or anywhere near that.
Even at 50sat/byte it *might* confirm this week as the mempool is clearing out a little, but I wouldn't count on that.

Yeah, close enough.
Even better, you'll be able to pay with compatible coins, such as Litecoin. In the future your wallet will just pick the coin you have (or "like to use"), do an atomic swap over lightning network, and the vendor gets Bitcoin that they desire.
Really exciting times. It's just a shame human nature gets in the way and the "want it now" feeling can become very strong. It's coming, we just have to wait and/or help with it. The waiting can be the hardest part sometimes.

And the transaction hasen't disappeared from the app yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:01:04
If you didn't pay an appropriate fee then the transaction won't go through. It's that simple. I deliberately put a low fee on my transaction, as I thought the fees would lower during Christmas. It seems my prediction was correct, although it needs to lower a little more before my transaction will be mined. It could take another month for all I care; I'm in no hurry for this one. I did another one a couple of days ago that was a bit more urgent. I put in a proper fee and it was included in the next block (if anything it was too high, I didn't want it to be included *that* quickly).
The fees will go down with the other enhancements coming and the introduction of second layer scaling. In the meantime the fees are higher than I would like, it's not great, but that's the way it is.
Bitcoin is still an experimental technology. There will be growing pains down the line.

If your wallet doesn't give you the option to get either your private keys, or a "backup phrase" to restore the wallet, then they are not your Bitcoins; they are IOUs on Bitcoin someone else is holding for you.

That assumes I just download a block at a time and do literally nothing else on the network.
Bitcoin allows up to 300 incoming connections by default. That's 300 people that could be requesting the latest block from me, or worse, transaction history as they are still syncing. Not to mention mempool and me actually transacting and whatever other overheads exist.
My bitcoin node was using way more than 34gb with its 1mb blocks. In fact, I'd even say it was using more than 34gb **per day**.
I did a quick Google and came across this reddit post which seems to confirm my thoughts: 
You should probably stop quoting that number. It's simply not accurate for bandwidth usage (but might be accurate for disk space usage). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:59:59

I've never used Green Address (didn't like the idea of Greenbits also having a private key to my bitcoin) so I'm unable to comment to be honest.

If you're paying $45 you are massively overpaying.
Use a wallet that allows you to set the fees yourself. Use something like this website  to gauge the price to pay. I find all wallets overestimate currently, even with the lowest setting. Hopefully not a long term issue, but I like to set the fee myself to save a little bit of money.
As you can see the current trend is downwards (it's Christmas, after all) and you can probably get away with 120sat/byte transactions if you want it confirming within about an hour or probably around 110 if you want it "sometime today". As long as your transaction isn't massive (lots of inputs and/or outputs) then that will be a lot lower than $45 with today's prices.

Two types of Segwit address:
p2sh - begin with a 3
bech32 - begin with a bc1
Both are segwit, but not all wallets support bech32 and will claim the address is invalid if you try to send to it. bech32 is a mildly better solution.
Not all addresses that begin with a 3 are segwit, to be clear.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:27:16


The main one for me was their support for the Segwit2x contentious hard fork attack (not the one happening this month, but the canceled one in November).
People who attack Bitcoin in this manner deserve no respect or support from the wider community and should be boycotted in my opinion.
So for me, that's a very strong reason to dislike Bitpay. Hating on them for complete sensationalist fabricated reasons is simply not needed.
Alternatives can be found here: 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:36:03


Probably. You should always assume the network is under attack. Bitcoin threatens a lot of industries and you should never assume they'll play nicely.


Maybe. Makes sense. Could also be some wealthy big blockers spamming so they can scream 'told you!' all the time.


Possibly, if they hit sufficient volumes. 




The bank is centralised and they have full control over their systems. If they decide you're doing something they don't like, they'll shut you down. Plus they probably don't have to store every transaction forever. Bitcoin doesn't work like that. 


No. It's the job of the miners to mine blocks that include transactions within them. The nodes validate and propagate the blocks. If the block is valid and is part of the longest chain the nodes have no business trying to censor transactions they may simply not like.

That won't work.
If we have a 'simple queuing system' then we have the issue where me or you could just fill up the queue with thousands of transactions to ourselves and clog up the queue. Remember, anyone can transact on Bitcoin and send data to it.
This would work if everyone was playing nice, but obviously that isn't always the case here.
There must be fees otherwise the queue would be infinitely long.

Regarding the 2x comment (Sorry, must have missed that). Segwit itself can go to roughly 2mb blocks, and maybe as high as 3.7mb or so depending on how the transactions are made. And that's *if* segwit gets close to maximum usage.
Segwit2x would have doubled that again.

Measuring bitcoin usage is tricky.

You are rude, aggressive, argumentative, and generally an all round asshole in this sub. You take one view and if anyone takes a *slightly* differing view they are 'sheeple' and whatever other bullshit insults you come up with. Your viewpoints are bordering on fascist. The amount of times myself and others have had to apologize for your behavior because you confuse the ever-living shit out of a newbie just asking an honest question is embarrassing. You are an embarrassment to this subreddit, both with this account and your old one, I am genuinely impressed with how you live 100% from bitcoin/litecoin and nothing else. But that's your choice, and that's fine, attempting to force it onto others where you insult them is not okay. Ever.
**Even here, in the response you gave me** you are still playing the "holier than tho" card. "I'm always right and anything anyone else ever thinks is wrong."
You even picked a fight with someone who innocently posted a picture of his child online recently because he wanted to share something cool with the community. Of course in your world it's a binary choice, "1 I'm right, 0 you're wrong". No middle ground, no debate, nothing. "I'm right, you're wrong, and that's an end of it". I surely hope this isn't how you parent.
LPT: If "everyone else is wrong", maybe you should look in a mirror to find out 'who is wrong'.
So no, it's nothing with do with "virtue", it's everything to do with the fact I think you're a colossal asshole and won't ever read whatever links you post to me.

Anyway, I'm nothing special. I'm not "average" (anyone who is actually holding bitcoin is probably some kind of minority) but I'm nothing special either.
People are using bitcoin to buy stuff. That's a fact. If it wasn't a fact, companies like bitpay simply wouldn't exist anymore. Maybe we're a niche of a niche, so be it. 
But to say 'nobody' is using it as a currency is just flat out wrong. Otherwise these btc to fiat processors would have shut up shop many years ago.
There are absolutely people who are using it. We're probably just a minority of the community.

There is nothing irrational about it.
It's their fault for having such a *terrible* reputation that people's first instinct is to assume Coinbase is being incompetant **yet again** because I honestly think this is the first time I've known of a Coinbase fuckup which wasn't actually their fault.
Bitcoin price on a rally? GDAX goes offline
Bitcoin price on a bit of a crash? GDAX goes offline.
Wire transfer or crypto being 'lost' (even when the blockchain confirms the transaction). Guess what, you've just been Coinbase'd, you're not getting that back. Good luck asking support to help you.
And let's not forget that Coinbase made contradictory statements on Segwit2X during that whole farce and the **insider trading** during the bcash launch.
Need to call Coinbase on the phone? Expect to wait for *hours* on the phone, and if you're really lucky you'll get to speak to a human who cannot help you and will just promise to 'escalate' your ticket (which does literally nothing) and might just hang up on you when you say you need it fixing before the next three months.
And of course, there have been many, many, many people who have complained that Coinbase have outright stolen from them and you get **no response** from "support". I technically still have a ticket that's 'open' from July when they double charged my card. I got two automated responses and a copy&amp;paste from 'support' who clearly didn't even bother to read a single word I wrote. I responded several times before going to my card issuer to get my money back.
Oh, and it's 2018. Still no segwit support (coming in the 'coming weeks' supposedly), still no transaction batching. We are **all** paying more for our transactions thanks to Coinbase being inefficient. Yet they expected us all to upgrade our own software to the broken segwit2x client, because it meant minimal effort to them instead of them just using the blockchain resource in an efficient way.
So no, this isn't irrational. When you see time and time and time and time again that Coinbase is **constantly** fucking up and have no idea how to treat customers or the wider network and community, it's just a fair assumption.

@_date: 2018-03-04 00:36:02
This is a fascinating perspective.
I personally disagree. I feel satoshi probably only had the wherewithal to just want to revolutionise money itself, and not the entire broader 'system' as it were, although I suppose an amount of that would be inevitable. It's gone beyond the original vision now as we're beginning to see and discover what is possible.

Not what we were 'debating'.


Also not what we were debating. We already have that. It's called cash. Bitcoin doesn't solve that problem nor has it ever claimed to to my knowledge, although with the public blockchain it would make it harder to hide the source of funds. Anyone making such a claim would be misguided.
So again: bitcoin is a niche. Bitcoin spenders are a niche of the niche, however people **are** using it, hence the existence of businesses that rely on this activity. Some people are choosing/forced to live off it. To say 'nobody' is using it is factually and demonstrably false.

Coinbase has such a terrible reputation of general incompetence poor support, insider trading, outright attacking bitcoin in some ways, that many were simply unable to give them any benefit of the doubt when something actually happened which wasn't their fault.

You are given a fiat to btc conversion price. Bitcoin is just too small and too volatile to have the price fixed in btc.
I didn't use it much in December directly. I instead used a debit card that converts my btc to fiat. Christmas was fairly cheap because of it. No longer an option thanks to nearly every bitcoin card being cancelled :(
I am using it with services online, not just trusted people. A plane from X-plane.org I think was my latest purchase. I used purse.io a lot as well. 
Most online services use something like bitpay to convert back to fiat. Unfortunate, but understandable, that's just where we are right now. 
A lot of the time I'm essentially doing a fiat to btc to fiat conversion. That doesn't matter to me: where I can, I'm opting out of a system which I consider to be disgustingly corrupt, even if it's for a small part of the journey. If that means I do 'pointless' things, so be it. Bitcoin finally gave me an offramp to use that I had craved long before I knew of Bitcoins existence. 
I'm not 100% bitcoin, I'm not that brave, sadly. But I do use it as an actual currency, whenever I get the option, and I honestly don't give a shit if people judge me in a negative way because of it (just look at the other idiotic replies I've had). I'm voting against a monetary system which I find utterly disgusting, corrupt, and not improving at all, every time I do this. And I'm voting in pretty much the only language that is understood these days; money.

Because I'm fairly sure that's done at OS level and is transparent to the app specifically. Just like hard drive encryption is transparent to software on my pc. The files are encrypted, but the app has no knowledge of this.
Although my android coding knowledge is rusty so I could be wrong.
Edit: also, hardware encryption is just *faster*, it doesn't at all mean it's more or less secure than software encryption. Android has had encryption since something like version 4, it's just more recent versions that have *required* it instead of it being optional.

It's only 'rude' because those pushing the 'bcash is bitcoin' narrative say it is. Nobody needed to take offence; they chose to because it hurt the false narrative they are trying to push.
Both names mean the exact same to me: shitcoin. You can call it one or the other, makes no difference, in fact, saying bcash out loud is simply easier. Not all altcoins are shitcoins, but bcash is 100% shitcoin.

Bitcoin didn't fail anything.
It kept finding blocks filled with transactions and those transactions are still on the blockchain today, nothing was reversed, circumvented or whatever else. It carried on exactly as designed. 
If you paid the appropriate fee, you got into the next block.
The fees went up. They were higher than we'd all have liked (myself included), but bitcoin itself didn't 'fail' in any way. It continued to work as designed and even saw off a hostile takeover attempt from Segwit2x, and we now have a great idea of who doesn't care about the network as they had the audacity to support the attack and somehow expected bitcoin to just roll over and accept it. 
In fact, is 2x would have been 'successful' the entire network would have ground to a halt due to the buggy code that was supposed to activate the fork. *That* would have been a failure.

Connect ledger
Enter pin on ledger
Start bitcoin app on ledger
Open chrome app
Exit bitcoin app on ledger
Start bitcoin app on ledger
Chrome app hopefully wakes up and works now
I usually have to do this, but the above sequence works for me every time. After that I can swap around the apps without any drama.

The addresses are valid to send to on both networks.
When you send bitcoin to a bcash Segwit address, the bcash network will see it as a 'anyone can spend' as they don't have any Segwit enforcing code. So at that point anyone can snatch the funds. That's the specific problem in this case, as soon, coinbase will only issue Segwit enabled receive addresses.
Before this point, coinbase is perfectly capable of recovering bitcoin accidently sent to bcash addresses.

We don't need a cap. If idiots want to overpay let them. Bitcoin provides all the incentives needed to stop this behaviour. If people choose to ignore these incentives that's their issue, not Bitcoin's.
If your exchange is charging you to move money into your own wallet and is also overpaying the network fee, then it's time to move.

It doesn't deserve the bitcoin name in any way shape or form and I refuse to call it 'Bitcoin' anything. If that hurts your fee fees then I simply don't care.
In the same way if I forked bitcoin and tried to call it 'Bitcoin dicky' people could, and absolutely should, call me out on creating a low effort shitcoin with no innovation and they would be within their rights to mock me and the name I'm trying to piggy of the back of. Same with gold, diamond, platinum and whatever other bullshit is trying to cash in on the name.
Also, consider samurai wallet. You get a Segwit discount when sending and the fee calculation is actually somewhat sane (although still high imo), but I'm sure bitcoin's dumb fee calculations are not *at all* politically motivated.

This may be unpopular here, but whatever, never stopped me before...
If you are in your 'late 20s' (so I'm going to assume 28-29), living in a first world country, and you can't afford $1000 for an emergency 'anything' then you are doing this whole 'life' thing wrong.
That shit is fine when you're 18-24 or something, but to be nearly 30 and not have your shit together enough to have a basic emergency fund at this point in your life should be a **major** wakeup call. You should be thinking about your older age at this point, and saving/investing/whatever for that, not struggling to scrape together tiny amounts like this to buy a beater car which you have to cheat to pass basic legal tests.
Bitcoin, whilst I love it dearly and use it whenever I can, is not something that should be relied on at this stage. You should only be investing what you can afford to lose into Bitcoin and no more. If you had to cash out just to get $1,000, then you've invested more than you can afford to lose.
If you have to cash out to get, say, $100,000 or something, then okay, fine, whatever. Well done on paying off your mortgage.
You should absolutely have 3-6 months of income in fiat savings somewhere super safe as a 'rainy day' fund, and your debts paid off except maybe your mortgage at this point. Buy the car was a no brainier ($400/month being wasted, absolutely) but **how** you came to this point should be a massive wake-up call. 
OP, this comes from a place of caring, I'm not trying to 'poke fun at the poor person' or anything like that. I've seen friends who I care about dearly in the same position as you with two cars, kids, great jobs, and somehow they are **still broke**. Up to their eyeballs in debt and everything goes on credit to be paid off 'some day'. They are saving something pitiful like $50 a month or something, and paying $100s on Interest, it's a joke. And they finally call me when it's too late in their mid 30s, asking 'dicky, how do you do this? how do you survive without credit? I'm worried about the future'. I've had this conversation so many times it hurts.
If you don't want to be in this situation in your late-50s and I suspect you *really* want to be retiring soon at that point, then you need to plan out how you're going to get there. It won't sort itself out, you'll have to do it. Good luck.

Not really, they just snatch it back from the exchange and apply a negative balance on their account if need be.
So even if you're a small mom and pop store just scraping by, if some asshole comes in with a stolen card and buys stuff from you, you lose both the goods, and the money you were 'paid'.
The banks *never* lose out. They *only* reason they are doing this is because Bitcoin threatens their core business of being a middleman.

I've been involved in various ways with bitcoin for roughly four years now. I don't have deep technical knowledge to the level of some developers around here, but I know enough of the politics and technicals to get by.
I am very much aware of the attacks that Ver and others have attempted over the years. Saying he has never attacked bitcoin is either an outright lie or willful ignorance. Every interview he's given in recent months since the fork has been pushing his altcoin whilst attacking bitcoin. If you are honestly claiming that these are not attacks then I simply have to assume you have an ulterior motive.
I won't be replying any further to your comments. It's a waste of my time.
