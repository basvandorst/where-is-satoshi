I feel like every exchange now is under attack after Mt. Gox. There's a supposed leaked document of coinbase users emails which was released April 1st and contains names like James Bond... People talking shit about BTC-E being shady and this exchange is shady and that exchange. So what should we all just ban every single exchange thats out there? Or how about we all just chill and stop trying to hack each other. At the end were all here to support Bitcoin for the future so why are we all against each other.

Right? I dont think anyone gives two shits about the bitcoin foundation. I never hear anyone even mention them when talking about bitcoin.

If you look at the charts you can see a similar rise and fall back in early 2013 and then it skyrocketed up. Its like history repeating itself.

If this isn't the real Satoshi Nakamoto that created bitcoin then the real creator should come out and reveal himself to save this guy from all the media attention. It's not fair for him to be harassed by the media this way.

What is it lately with all this hate for exchanges? Mt. Gox goes down and suddenly everyone is like beware of this exchange or that exchange. Is it just paranoia?

Who assigned these people to the bitcoin foundation or even started it and why do people listen to what they have to say. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized with no one in charge so why do they have such powers? Pay taxes on bitcoin uhm i dont think so. Government doesnt own bitcoin nor can it regulate it it's a worldwide currency. This is such BS! How can the IRS even prove you own bitcoin. Your name or any personal information is not tied to any wallet. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:59:54
Thats not an offline wallet. An offline wallet would be something like a paper wallet or a wallet on a pc that has never been connected to the internet at all.

I think major corporations are going to take over as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I think america will become almost like a third world country where most of the people are poor and corporations and their ceo's are the only ones with money and will run the country
