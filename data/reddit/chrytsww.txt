The government should open an investigation and make an example of whoever leaked the info (regardless of whether they were paid or not). 
If this was the action of a private business, I'd have no problem with Bloomberg's actions. However, as I have said, this is the action of the government, so everyone should have the right to know the news at the same time.
And I actually think this is good news for bitcoin in the long run... if they can stop some of the market manipulation, then I'd be happy. I don't get angry at these news at all, as I'm here for the long term and I don't think I will ever sell the bitcoin I have now.

I'm not blaming Bloomberg, although it is also inmoral on their end because they are using information that should be public knowledge (because it comes from the government) to their own benefit. 
I'm blaming the government that gave this info to Bloomberg instead of making a public press release... I don't even know why they would act this way, but the fact is that they did. Why does Bloomberg have the right to know about this before the other people holding bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:37:10
You are most likely right. But then the government should fire the people that sold this info, instead of standing by which is probably what they are doing.
And Bloomberg is doing its job, of course, it's a business. But it is an inmoral one. Bribing government staff so that they can get access to privy info before public release when they know these people shouldn't be allowed to disclose any news that can affect the market.
This should be a fair market where all PUBLIC info should be made available to everyone at the same time.

Information that affects everyone shouldn't be sold to only those who can afford it BY THE OWN GOVERNMENT. It's the same old game of money making more money... I thought that was one of the things bitcoin was trying to change.

I agree but most people are greedy and become more greedy the more money they have, in part because it's easier for them to generate more money. It's a vicious cycle and only the truly great people can see beyond that (St. Francis of Assisi for example).

This should be illegal... 
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:49:41
Exactly... shame on them!

I'm no expert but no. If that were the case the network would be congested. The exchange actually owns your BTC, they just assign that amount to your account. When you buy from someone else, the just update the ledger to reflect the new "ownership". The bitcoins don't actually move anywhere. They stay in the same wallet owned by the exchange.

Isn't the ledger essentially cold storage? I mean, if I use an usb to store my private key it's actually less safe because if they ask me to unlock it, they could see my private key just like that. Same with a paper wallet.
Encrypting the passwords is a very good idea I hadn't thought of. I don't know how to do it but I'm going to look into it for sure. Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:02:21
Ok, thanks for the banks suggestions. 
Yeah, I guess its safer to keep it with me. I hope they understand when I tell them it's a "cryptocurrency wallet".
Isn't it riskier to have all your passwords being accesible by just one password? I never liked password managers because your passwords are being stored somewhere, and if someone hacks it then you are screwed all around. The piece of paper is kept hidden away and I only use it when I log in. I also have 2FA, so they would need my phone (unlocked). The back-ups for the 2FA are kept on a safe hidden somewhere on my home country. I don't have much money to begin with, and even less on exchanges, so I don't think anyone would go through all the trouble of stealing my piece of paper and phone. I will nevertheless look into password managers. An encrypted usb like the Ledger would give me some comfort, but no way I'm using any online services.

Thanks. I googled it and there is some info but not much. Is it going to be able to host lots of tokens like Ethereum? If so, that's huge. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:28:28
Ooh right, it makes so much sense that smart contracts are need for lightning implementation. If not for them, one end of the payment channel could close it and take all the money.

Yea that's what I thought about the ledger. I didn't know about the multi-signature feature, it's pretty cool for extra security as you say.
Ok, thank you. I will do that. I can't risk having my university and rent bank account frozen.  
@_date: 2018-07-10 10:11:21
Yeap. The only network transactions that originate from centralized exchanges are when you send/deposit funds to/from another bitcoin address. Decentralized exchanges on the other hand do make network transactions every time you buy&amp;sell within the exchange. The top ones right now are IDEX for tokens on Ethereum and Switcheo for tokens on NEO. I don't know of any DEX for bitcoin other that localbitcoins. There are no tokens on the bitcoin network so it doesn't make sense to build a bitcoin-based DEX.

Wow that page looks pretty nice. I hope it grows a lot in the coming years. 
Yes... I don't think we'll ever solve that problem. Reputation will always matter in some way imho. Maybe there could be an algorithm that checked the quality of the product, and told the buyer if it's legit. That algorithm would be very very hard and complex to program in some cases thou. Like crazy hard.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:01:28
Yep that's what I meant by (almost). I guess that'sit's impossible to eliminate some need of trust on that transaction :/
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:00:24
Oh yeah I know about a ethereum (a little). I didn't know Bitcoin had them too!!

Interesting... I guess the only way to avoid this crash would be to make his intentions clear about distributing his bitcoins to the poor before making any move. However, he would have to reveal his identity and provide proof of being Satoshi without touching the coins in order for people to believe him and don't freak out when he does move them... which I don't think he would :/
Maybe there is a way without revealing his identity... only time will tell.
