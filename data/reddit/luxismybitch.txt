That was my point, if the deflatory system would be forced upon economy it would benefit the poor people and also not hurt rich ones as much as they think.

It may be true for economy we have now, but in future world will be based on deflationary currency because that will prevent crap being everywhere you turn as it is right now it is quantity over quality, deflation will turn that around eventually.
And rich people already hoard money or real-estate, in this case they would hoard bitcoin instead which would free up a lot of homes and make them much cheaper, as people would have bigger profits holding bitcoin so they would sell real-estate for bitcoin and lower the prices of it. 
Deflationary currency is definitely better for people who dont know how to use their money and are financially illiterate - aka most of the world population.

Lol Europe collapsing, where do you guys get this shit news

Are you for real? The only way your statement would be even close to true is if bitcoin farms were extremely innovative.
But they are not, as you said its money, so that means they are efficient on a dollar. If you make bitcoin mining on fossil fuel more efficient than anything else, i will bet you all my shit that most of the miners will go for it.

And he never figured out the last one as bitcoin is doing quite the opposite today.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:58:16
Oh it will work, thats why i have it. Just stop claiming its helping environment because its not. And go to school also please
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:10:47
Will.. in the future.. will..should..often.. 
A bunch of crap!
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:37:56
How? Its money thats the incentive not bitcoin itself, at least thats how it looks to me
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:20:30
You need regulation on some things. There will be no market competition because noone has the money to place down the cables (so no cometition, just a monopoly, which is worse, thats why you need to regulate it)... please think or read before you talk
And also im from Europe, we have heavy regulation on the internet and it has more market competition, and its more free.
Not every time you hear goverment its all bad, please learn

On December 23, 2013 the Slovenian Ministry of Finance made an announcement[113] stating that bitcoin is neither a currency nor an asset. There is no capital gains tax chargeable on bitcoin, however bitcoin mining is taxed and businesses selling goods/services in bitcoin are also taxed.

Never had a problem yet with coinbase, their app is very user friendly too...
I was online during the 3000$ dip and i could of easily bought with coinbase if i wanted.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:40:14
Doesn't coinbase do exactly the same thing except you have 2500 limit ? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:41:33
Why are they idiots? They made money selling at 4500 and buying back at 3000-3500... its just your opinion
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:13:16
I guess limit depends from person to person but yeah that was my point. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:47:49
They cant, nobody can. Technology dosent seem to be scalable. Apple are only in it for $$, couldn't care less shits about Bitcoin if it wouldn't make shareholders some money
