Looks like WSJ's masters thought it was time to roll out another round of War On Cash scaremongering, and issued a directive. I bet they have a whole stash of these articles pre-written &amp; ready to go.

That's all bitcoin was before 2013 too.

The race is on... network effect is probably going to determine the dapp platform winner so let's see who can get it up &amp; running first.

He frequently refers to himself as black... then again he also frequently refers to himself as 'cis female'.

OK so everyone's commenting on the irrelevant Mark Karpeles pic but the headline says WU integrates with Coinbase. Where's the link? I searched the WSJ site &amp; can't find any mention of this.
