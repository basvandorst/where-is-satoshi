Yes, there's "20%" in calculation being deducted, but the two '10%' fees don't equate.

Yeah I knew it was Cafe Biscotti - personally never went but a friend of mine did. That's pretty poor that someone stole the funds :/, especially when it's small business. 
Edit: reason for not going was didn't have any funds.

You made me laugh pretty fucking hard

Dankje wel for this post, love reading about other students experience with Bitcoin, and I have to say I'm pretty jealous in Australia here, wish we had that kind of rapid adoption.

To be fair I'm probably not the best spokesperson for Bitcoin, although I am an enthusiast. He didn't like the idea of the sense of "Bitcoins" not being physical, as in they're just data and don't actually "exist". I mentioned, however, of another cafe in the CBD that did accept Bitcoin, and remarked on how they gained additional customers because of that.

The first 20 seconds is all about animal testing -.- ..

"Anybody who holds a significant amount of Bitcoins in Australia also better watch the fuck out, or the ATO is going to pump it in your ass harder than you pumped your pyramid scheme "
Yeah if you could just elaborate..

Yes but any withdrawal is good news, it would be nice to know that your money isn't actually lost, rather being withheld temporarily
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:43:04
Calm down, Santa
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:22:49
I meant that I mentioned the idea of accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. I've seen that a large majority of times when people adopt digital currency as an alternative method of payment, a new stream of customers come in - even some people who would much rather go out of their way, just for the novelty of purchasing with cryptocurrency

Well Dogecoin is actually doing some great work for fundraising. It's helping a lot of people contribute even a little amount to a good cause.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:01:33
The article doesn't confirm it, it however, posits the possibility. But in the context of the actual name and not the entity 'Satoshi Nakamoto', it is very real.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:30:39
Literal translation^
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:00:43
What is the point of this claim, and even if it were true? I don't see any signs of "I need more Bitcoins :((!1" in OP's thread.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:08:02
Regardless if this poor man is even the real 'Satoshi N', his life is most certainly going to get much harder. 
The author of the article is such a piece of fucking scum. I challenge you to look at her profile picture for a minute without feeling the upmost disrespect in the field of journalism

Ah shit a crypto locker. I'm sorry to hear, man..how much did they charge?
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:59:18
No, I agree. It's a great introduction to crypto-currency, the community is pretty adamant about friendliness and welcoming, especially with its tip culture.  
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:00:23
Until they discovered this simple trick BANKS hate?
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:26:16
This sort of stuff is fantastic to see!
I tried introducing a coffee shop owner about the idea of Bitcoin, but he's a bit traditional and doesn't like the idea of not having some physical representation of value :p
(I'm in Perth, WA - we got internet two years ago)
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:47:34
Very well said.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:57:48
So that would mean the person got into Bitstamp and then added the 2fa codes to their device, and transferred funds from there?
Does Bitstamp not require 2fa on login?
(Genuinely don't know, not trying to ridicule.)
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:42:13
Sorry, could you explain it?
I don't mean you can have a *good*, for arguments sake it costs $500, and if you were to buy it then sell it at the same price with BTC, it would be 500-(500*0.2)

Personally not so sure, but I know that Truecrypt ~~is used and is~~ was pretty reliable.
Edit: Not so sure now. :P
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:23:25
Maybe due to the fact there is no journalist trying to uncover as much personal information for some sort of credibility to slap on a story

I was able to send money to Coinjar through ANZ, although this was back in Feb, March (this year).
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:11:34
I don't know why but seeing this just gives me butterflies
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:02:38
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:25:33
I know! I'm saying it **wouldn't** be 500+(500*0.2) -&gt; where you would 'pay' $100 GST
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:07:55
Yeah, I feel pretty bad for them.

Sometimes it's worth having a little risk :)

Your comment needs to be up there.

I'm glad you're here to shine the light on us all
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:34:01
Care to explain why you say that?

Why is our piss so expensive :(

Yes I think you're definitely right. Now I have to look for alternative encryption methods

Like a nice deep fried dough. Common way to eat is to load it with shredded cheese. Otherwise salt + garlic.

Exactly... and who leaves the seed for their bitcoin wallet lying around in their physical wallet? Especially if the balance is 70BTC.
