Guys, you just need to click on those sketchy looking dating apps that they advertise on porn sites!  
I heard that one of them recently announced a partnership with Bosch, Microsoft, and all of China!!  Get in now while they're cheap!!

The merchant can easily lower their price to cover transaction costs.  
I agree that there's no such thing as a "chargeback" with crypto currencies, but that just means that they may not be suitable for all purposes (renting a hotel room, for instance, since the hotel room might be in a far worse condition than advertised).  
They're still suitable for anything you'd currently pay for with cash.

Lol yep. Apparently people here think that "diversified investment portfolio" means bitcoin + a basket of shitcoins.

Also xrp is super centralized. 
Nobody talks about xrp’s UNL system, but it’s the list of trusted validators that’s the basis for consensus, and it’s created and distributed by Ripple. 
They like to say things like “we reached a new milestone! Only 50% of xrp validators are controlled by Ripple!” But it’s still Ripple who decides which validators are on the UNL that everyone uses.

I'm invested in both btc and ethereum and have no inherent bias.
That said, from a technological perspective, it seems like there's no comparison. 
Ethereum is like a smartphone and Bitcoin is one of those Motorola cell phones from the mid 90s.
They can both make phone calls, but one can do so much more.
At this point, I think Bitcoin has name recognition and that's about it

Coinbase doesn't actually have a Bitcoin wallet for each user. Rather they have an entry in their database of how much Bitcoin they owe you. 
So this would be different.

We don't know what they do.   People trust them because they're big and have a good reputation.  You also have the option of moving your bitcoins to your own wallet whenever you want, so that helps ease people's minds.
