It's essential for all sorts of escrow transactions where you need money to be tied up

Go online, buy 100 BTC worth of LTC using your zero confirmation 100 BTC fee. Repeat the process 20 times spending the same inputs for the transaction and the fee. Turn your LTC back into 2000 BTC. You are now richer by 1800 BTC.

Maybe if you entered in the serial no of the replacement parts used and the sales order number from the parts supplier.

I bought about $50 at under $2/coin the very bottom of the dip and had them leveraged on a 100 btc long position on Bitcoinica aka Zhou Tong's bank account.

How much did it come to?
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:52:44
All of the initial stuff was on the cryptography mailing list before bitcointalk forums existed. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:48:10
You need to think in percentages, not dollars. It's less than 5 doublings away, that's high for sure, but roughly on par with the average growth over the last 5 or 6 years.

The article doesn't actually address the premise at all it just kind of hand waves over all of the technical points.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:52:33
It should really default to a log scale for comparing historical data across different orders of magnitude.
You should also include the original cryptography mailing list discussions too:

Everyone knows the ETF decision will push the price up or down. 
Someone pretends to have insider information that the ETF is approved and buys in hard. The price jump causes those who are watching to pile in thinking that this is the moment of announcement. Then the original buyer sells and profits and things bounce around a bit. 
It might not even have been on purpose. Traders are on a hair trigger waiting for the announcement and most probably have nots watching the price to react quicker.

Do records of historic gold prices exist going back more than 1000 years ago?
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:57:25
But how? Nobody ever mentions how it will technically work!
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:02:35
by about one standard deviation it seems

I think a constant continuous supply is much more elegant. It still approaches zero inflation just with a different curve.

MTGOX withdrawals were locked so that $ was not exchangeable for USD at that time however. It was just Disneyland money.
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:55:10
It's not really accurate because dollar withdrawals were locked at the time. So $1242 in MTGOX money wasn't the same as $1242 in cash because you couldn't actually spend it or withdraw it. All you could do was use it to buy bitcoin.

That's a really long article for a really simple idea: the opposite of volatility is simply not possible when there is massive growth.
* Bitcoin must increase in value from zero to a large amount if it becomes widely used over time.
* Nothing that's publically traded can increase in value like that smoothly monotonically and steadily because it would be an obvious easy investment to anyone watching. 
* Obvious investments get bought until they are no longer obvious good investments and then they become bad investments. The market players factor in the expected future price difference until the future price isn't obvious and the price becomes based on a speculative future.

As far as I know, there are no charges and no pending trial on the hire for murder allegations. 
For most drugs on the Silk Road, cutting out the middle man put suppliers in closer contact with users. This reduced the violence on the distribution end. There is no territory to control or low level dealers to compete with. 
The other big benefit was the rating system cut back on a lot of adulteration of substances. 
Overall, I think that the online drug marketplace has reduced the human harm a great deal in comparison to traditional back-alley dealing. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:20:45
Yeah, I think they do, but I said reduced violence on the distribution end, not the supply end. Silk Road didn't create the demand for drugs, it just changed how it got into the end users hands. I doubt it has even the slightest measurable impact on the production of illegal drugs.

Did you even bother to read the Article?

hired murder was not was he was charged with or sentenced for

Owning gold with nobody to sell it to is like owning Bitcoin private keys with no internet connection. One is a lump of heavy metal, the other is a unique number.

Aghhh this too was addressed in the article. Just read the words damnit

Why is this paper not written in LaTeX?
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:55:26
LaTeX compiled documents are most commonly compiled as PDFs. I think that's probably what 90% of users do with it. It just makes the equation formatting so much nicer.
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:09:58
Do you realize that LaTeX can be used to produce PDF documents? In fact that is what most people use it for, particularly math and computer science academics, who write papers just like this one.

So many drugs, money well spent.

You could only go negative on really big volatility.. like we get with bitcoin. The trading algorithm would always lag the Mt Gox price on big swings and couldn't make margin calls fast enough.
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:47:48
Certainly speculation and hype was a big part of it, but also the worlds largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Magic The Gathering Online Exchange, was executing trades with made up money which put them into insolvency and further drove up the price by devaluing the exchanges virtual dollars which couldn't actually be withdrawn.  
Essentially they pumped up the price by buying bitcoins with imaginary dollars and then the price of Bitcoin went even higher because they stopped letting customers withdraw dollars. So customers had to buy more bitcoins just to get any of their money back out of the exchange.

Say he is Satoshi and he doesn't actually want to be revealed. It would be a pretty good cover.

Bitcoinica would let you open multiple accounts, leverage them all 10:1 against each other, and run half of them into negative balances

Constant reward would also approach zero inflation on a much longer timescale. To the best of my knowledge a logarithmic decrease in production was chosen because it's like gold.

Who is going to accept payment in NewBitcoins? I know I wouldn't take them. I imagine most merchants and users would stick with the original, even if the miners left. There is no motivation for buyers and sellers to switch forks. 
And with all the actual value there, the incentive to mine NewBitcoin just isn't there. You get more of nothing, meanwhile, the effective difficulty of regular Bitcoin just dropped by a factor of 20. Even though the difficulty is slow to, adjust, the fact that there's less competition already moves the odds.

You've clearly never experienced the difficulty of getting pure anything on the street. DNM products do get chemically tested on a regular basis and it absolutely makes a huge difference.

Kind of a poofy article that is light on information and gets a few details wrong.

They actually are safer online, because their is a feedback and review process to check what's actually in the drug and in what concentration, unlike on the street where users have zero extra info of what they are taking other than what their dealer tells them.
