I've pretty much always bought at ATHs and I don't regret a thing
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:14
I tried like fuck to buy and my bank screwed me basically. Now on hold to bitch ..
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:21:58
It went up 600% in a month, no where in the stock market will you find a better gain without illegal practices. People I tell have a couple misconceptions that once cleared up seem more responsive to the idea. 1) You do NOT have to purchase a whole coin, so many people think you do. 2) You can get your money out or even spend bitcoin at certain places. 3) Yes, it's too late to put in $100 and buy a yacht (lol) but it's not too late to make midsize investment (based on your income) and get a nice head start in life if it ever goes up 10-fold again (which it will)

I bought $120 worth when they were 8 cents each and used it to purchase weed. I smoked away millions and it wasn't even good weed. You'll be alright.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:18:55
My wallet will be ready
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:55:32
Yes it's worth it. Get a wallet and sign up for an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:46
Yeah exchanges were backed up with nearly 5x the normal wait times for approvals 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:07:13
Probably Satoshi lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:18:14
Amen. I only hold bit and lite now. And at one point I will probably dump all lite to buy bit as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:12:21
Despite the mass influx of people there are still so many people who will adopt within the next 2-6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:49:06
It's the first thing I've been telling people and they look floored.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:52:24

Coins per block I believe
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:54:27
Thinking closer to 2030
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:00:29
lol fkn committed 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:08:08
Roughly 30% as well. Not overly worried, cash flow is pretty steady with work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:30
Hey I am also a Canadian. I find Quadrigacx to be a good option for purchasing bitcoin. I am not sure what the wait times could be now but I had some friend's say it was about a week recently.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:16:35
I tossed in half a pay cheque today at ath and didn't even care what happened afterwards. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:13
Recovering nicely 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:11:16
She gone
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:30
I've known many people who got paid out only to come back and do very well financially yet again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:15
Sorry man
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:47
I'd be surprised if it dipped lower than it did hours ago anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:01:59
Can't be done anymore. Mine some dogecoin for fun
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:34
Keep trying. I had mine fail about 8 times before I got it. Iphone 6 finally did it. Trying setting it down on a white page and get it right in the frame.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:36:12
Yeah I never have more than a couple hundred on my exchanges unless I'm active.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:28
Choice is always obvious IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:57:55
How long do buys in GDAX take? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:48:42
People are just down because its "too late" to get filthy private jet rich off of $100. Its certainly not too late to invest and set yourself up good for the future, not even this time next year would be too late.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:00:18
Depends on how many computers you have set up to buy yeezys lol but yeah I agree it's a bit more frustrating when a large sum of your finances are the thing lagging out.
Wouldn't making a more water'd down version be easier to run and cause less freezing? Supreme has a pretty basic site and it rarely freezes, even during their most popular release times.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:47:45
Yeah, I know. We were teenagers and someone showed us silk road. We thought it was super sketchy but expected internet weed to be awesome for some reason. It was never about the bitcoin...
A friend set his gaming computer up to farm coins for a while but we all kinda got disinterested. Fast forward 2013 all kicking ourselves in the ass.. STILL didn't buy in. Now about to empty my savings into this fucker. If I don't make a chunk of $ off bitcoin in my lifetime I'm probably going to hate myself forever.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:59
Oh, he still drove home
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:12
I'll give it a download now. Want a real time ticker that can be displayed on my lock screen, sadly doubt it will happen soon
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:16:25
Coincap (app) for IOS is nice. Lets you make an "Altfolio" and add coins 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:53:01
LOL call the other canadian sites and ask about wait times.. looking at about 5-7 days atm
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:21:38
No you're right I would absolutely not do that to a family member. I've talked to him extensively about his finances and he has well over 2m in assets with about 35k in yearly living expenses. He's fine with this risk.
Edit: Also, he still works at 76 and makes ~150-200k annually
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:59:39
Yeah I know, it's more stable
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:58
How secure are app wallets? Better than online but obv not as good as cold storage?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:26:17
What would cause a 50% crash at this point though?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:44
Tried my hardest to buy and my fkn bank screwed it up. lol missed the dip gunna go KMS
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:25:09
28.99 wow.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:11
I'm laughing while buying too :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:44
Go to bed
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:34:24
I would put them in a friend's store front.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:17:37
I hope more places will just accept it as payment by that point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:22:13
Of course it was his decision to call me. If the price ever crashes he won't miss the money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:12:17
Keep buying and flipping items, makes better gains than letting my $ sit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:25
Tempting but if it doesnt then you might take a big haircut
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:54
Haha yes I did! Did you actually predict that or just happened to catch it dropping? Managed to buy pretty much at the bottom of it and make 10% back quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:48
People who applied to exchanges during the initial "Over 9000!" news are just getting approved and online now. Expect big gains this week boys!
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:09:29
CASE SOLVED! /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:44:20
Buy now or wait and buy?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:53:32
We might have found the floor? High/Low numbers on my exchange are 300 apart.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:39
Assuming it's a singular person. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:27:24
I see it..
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:09
Well I can't throw satoshis at strippers yet
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:38:04
Nah, keep scaremongering until my verification completes and I can buy in
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:15
Lame af
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:25:14
Probably got drunk and lost his keys
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:48:57
C'mon man they ain't hurtin' no body
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:43:48
6 figures or bust
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:52:03
Same thing happens when adidas launches Yeezys on it's website. Bitcoin popularity is crazy right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:40:29
Its never a bad time
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:02:13
All the people from the "over 9000" news just getting approved by exchanges now. Prepare for new money incoming.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:13:37
Im thinking about putting in a bulk order and starting to flip them here in my city
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:30:37
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:40:39
It was a joke. lol just like dogecoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:13:27
You don't sadly. They cut the canadian portion of their services months ago but are still taking $ from customers.. pretty damn fraudulent if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:25:13
lol it is recommended through the link on the sidebar
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:18:51
Depends on total invested.. If the limit is 2k and you're able to pay off 2k in 3-4 months of working then sure. If the limit is 10k and it'd take you 2 years to pay that off then NO.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:45:05
HODL is what I'm doing. I just tried to make sure I could cash out if needed and it wouldn't work. Found an old reddit thread of pissed off Canadians saying the same. 
I am waiting to be approved by Quadriga CX now at the advice of another user.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:58:06
Today wasn't it
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:46:12
Try Quadriga CX. I just had the same issue with coinbase and left.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:58
What would you say current risk/reward sweet spot is? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:32:52
... grow weed?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:56:21
Look up the ones that transfer easily into bitcoin and try those, or maybe even one more obscure like doge coin. Someone else might be able to offer better suggestions (If so tag me lol)
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:54:06
You'd need to sink huge money into a mining rig not just your gaming computer. Maybe try mining an ALT coin instead because you won't do anything in bit mining.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:25
New but not new. Missed the train a few times and regret it.. if I dont get in on the train ima kms 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:48:21
Yeah same, thats why I attempted a withdrawl. Quadriga seems like a good option.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:41:11
Probably one transaction. 20k overall isn't too much
Edit: access to 14,000 accounts.. so big ballers only
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:04
Good looking out! I saw the price gap between buy and sell on their site and was pretty suspicious, was looking for alternatives to purchasing easily here in Canada... bought on coinbase only to find out I cant withdraw anything
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:42
Trying but these damn sites and their limits
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:00:20
Canadian here, you can't cash out via coinbase, DO NOT USE. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:47:44
Isn't it almost impossible for regular folk to mine anymore?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:17:28
is it better than canadianbitcoins.com?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:10:05
I work with minimal expenses and roughly $1000 of expendable income each month. Total savings ~10k atm. It's a decent size risk but I'm tired of watching from the sidelines on btc
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:49
If I empty my savings I could buy 1 coin. Tempting. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:33:15
Oh man..
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:34:59
1. I wouldn't know how to buy or store it if I did.
2. I wanted to buy in at 900 when I could afford multiple coins but now can't even afford one.
3. Seems daunting to drop my savings into something like this and then get crushed but the reward could be extravagant down the road..
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:10
Debating on putting my entire savings into it right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:59:55
I hope it goes to 50k. But also hope it dips between so I can buy in
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:02:20
I actually paid 13.5m for a half oz. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:00:40
Which site?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:43:16
Sooo buy litecoin now? Also what does it mean to be cross-chain transferable?
