The only thing I don't like about that, is that it will disrupt being able to share graphed data and things like that.

I think that suspending trading is only going to amplify the crash:

If I recall correctly, the biggest individual bitcoin holding was around 430 000 coins, with one other at 100 000, and a few other large holders at 50 000.
