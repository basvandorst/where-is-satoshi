I've been hearing that for years now...

Generally good advice, but Mint does this.

It's an extremely long time in the world of crypto.

It's funny, in situations like this, 2FA doesn't even make that much of a difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:02:38
Those got more accessible over time, not less...

And who decides?

He fell for phishing, don't worry, this has nothing to do with the security of Binance.

Is there an LBC alternative that doesn't cooperate with authorities?

@_date: 2017-12-13 20:31:06
What, do they just die poor and in debt? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:38:54
9% in ten years would be about 1% annually, which wouldn't even beat inflation. 
If it were annual, then yes, that's a great return. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:30:12
I could Express Mail you cash. That would be faster than a bank transfer.

Why do people still use bitcoin? Is first mover advantage really that strong?

@_date: 2017-12-02 11:51:51
Don't give bitcoin to someone unless you know they'll want it. 
You could give them a paper wallet.

Yeah, especially since they're critical of big banks, and Trump was talking about restricting money flow across the border, which crypto would subvert.

That is possible, however, if he already got his money back, what's stopping him from talking again?

I agree with him. 
It's an important discussion to have, of course, but let's not forget that it's primarily us against the authoritarian government fiat system, not us against each other. 
The victory of any coin would be infinitely better than the domination of the authoritarian government fiat system. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:54:56

Doesn't support cash by mail. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:14:46
It's also possible that we only hear more about the bad experiences with LocalBitcoins because they're the biggest. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:22:36
Well, LocalBitcoins had escrow, reputation, and arbitration. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:44:03
I've done hundreds of cash by mail trades, and none of those bad things have ever happened. 
I take a video of myself opening the cash, and the number of times they've not sent good cash I can count on one hand, even trading with users with no reputation. 
And even in those cases, because the trade is protected by escrow, the dispute can be resolved in my favor, and I don't lose any money. 
To be fair, I have been scammed a few times, but it's always been because of my own foolishness, and could have been easily prevented by being just a little more careful. 
Of course, foolish mistakes can lead to losses in centralized exchanges too. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:45:13
Fair point. 


It is good to understand your illness and treatment to some reasonable degree, and it is good to be an advocate for yourself and have a healthy skepticism. Lives have been saved by patients seeking second opinions from other doctors. Of course, lives have also been lost by patients ignoring medical advice. 


Yes, that is a problem. Stories of bad mechanics ripping off unsuspecting customers are ubiquitous. If you can have a little knowledge of how your own car works, who would argue that is a bad thing? 


Yes, this is very much a terrible problem. There are countless stories of police abusing their power. I personally am rather sympathetic to the anti police arguments, but that's a political discussion. 


And the fundamental task of society is to learn how to cooperate effectively while maintaining individuality. And I think crypto does a great job of that. Is it simultaneously global and individualistic, inclusive of everyone, but requiring the permission of nobody. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:46:00
Move to an exchange that allows for anonymity? 
I'm really disappointed no good replacements for LBC have been mentioned in any of the top comments... 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:44:53
Sure, but until then, bridging the gap between crypto and fiat is the biggest problem we face.

Oh, what a party pooper. 
It's a special occasion!

This why cash by mail is a good method of payment. 
No verification required, and impossible to chargeback. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:24:48
LocalBitcoins unfortunately recently started requiring ID for making listings, and for anyone with "significant" trade volume, and for anyone, at any time, when triggering the automated fraud detection system (which has plenty of false positives reported), or simply at their discretion. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:14:05
I just mean for withdrawal. 
(I'm not going to do a chargeback on myself...) 
@_date: 2017-02-19 09:46:23
Lack of acceptance, etc. 
I also don't have much power in most economic relationships. 
If I owned a store, I could decide to accept bitcoin, but if I shop at a store, I can't just decide to pay with it, if they don't want to accept it. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 10:38:40
Haha, I will, when I get money. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 10:48:56

@_date: 2017-02-07 19:09:55
Ah. I am low volume, so I guess it's good, but just curious, what exchange her lower fees? I thought a quarter of a percent was pretty low...

When people neglect to mention where they're from, they're usually from the US, self centered Americans. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:21:18
Pay interest? You mean like an overdraft fee? I would think they just wouldn't allow the withdrawal... 
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:51:48
Could always just get a new one, right? 
@_date: 2017-02-01 02:49:43
Well, it is open source... 
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:38:35
You can get an anonymous bitcoin debit card, I think. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:05:25
So basically, an ACH transfer. 
But can I withdraw cash on a transfer that hasn't been fully cleared yet? 
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:55:09
It doesn't work like that because there are plenty of people who buy low and sell high. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:28:19
What replaced it, btw? 
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:48:06

The more I use bitcoin, the more I begin to hate the government fiat system. 
Will the IRS come after me if they see I'm transferring money between Gemini and Bank of America? 
I presume capital losses are deductible or something, so you only pay taxes on the profit you actually make, net? 
Do they usually look at bank account information, if they have no other reason to?

I know there's controversy, but as a user, I just want something that works.

There is no benefit to buying now compared to in a few days, as I can't withdraw until the ACH clears. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:40:39
Why?

Of course I'm not seriously considering mining on a large scale. 
I'm just curious about the fluctuations in profitability. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:15:40
PayPal is terrible. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:47:15
To protect against fraudulent payments? 
There's pretty much no online fiat payment that's irreversible. 
A chat system would be good because many of the people who buy from me on LocalBitcoins are inexperienced. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:21:31
Hm, I don't know. 
Would it work only under optimal conditions?

@_date: 2017-03-20 12:55:19
How could it involve bank transfers, but no fraud?

It could be on any exchange with an API, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 03:44:11
I wouldn't go so far as to say that. 
It's still important to get the word out. 
People can't choose to use it if they don't even know it's an option.

Is it considered a "prepaid" debit card? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:14:17

LocalBitcoins current outgoing bitcoin network fee: 0.0002775 BTC.

Super high fees, low limits, inconvenient, slow, and often do require ID anyway.

Doesn't support cash by mail, and requires you keep it running on your computer all the time. (last I checked)

@_date: 2016-12-28 12:00:59
What's the limiting factor...? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:32:16
You don't understand bitcoin. 
You can use an escrow service. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:19:11
Also, why do people talk about censorship? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:13:26
What about seller protection? 
Why would you need buyer protection? 
Once you get the bitcoin, it's good. 
It's like a physical product that might be faulty. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:08:40
Buyer protection is the opposite of seller protection. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:48:13
No, efficiency wouldn't matter, because electricity is free. 
The only thing that would matter would be the cost of the miner itself, and of course how powerful it is. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:50:22
I'm really just curious if there are any manufacturers that focus on optimizing hash per unit of purchase cost, rather than hash per unit of electricity cost. 
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:55:14
I'm not in such a situation myself, but I'm curious, and find the lack of good information frustrating. I'd like to know how it all works.
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:55:10
What about the dogecoin tip bot? 
Or the bitcoin tip bot that came before changetip? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:06:30
Yea, but online. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:28:50
It says "world's most efficient miner" which is kinda the opposite of what I was asking... 
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:36:34
Why did the IRS set the threshold at 20k, rather than lower?
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:21:03

Why not both? 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:34:10

What's the difference?

I was under the impression that PayPal had those features. 
Also, from my experience, PayPal is much more common.

[By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.](
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:03:25
But doesn't it apply to other exchanges too?
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:53:47
"fraud, hacks and companies disappearing" is not a problem with the bitcoin protocol itself. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:53:25


Well, to buy bitcoin, for one. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:45:02


From the article: 


What's the threshold for being identified by either of those, and does that mean that the exchanges don't automatically report activity below the threshold?

But wires are so expensive... 
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:44:43
Could you just answer the question without being presumptuous and judgemental? 
If it would make you feel any better, assume I live in a very cold place and use the heat from mining to offset heating costs, or I have solar panels and live off the grid, so the excess electricity would otherwise be wasted. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:24:44
That's what changetip did. 
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:37:39
Do they report some other form? I'm pretty sure I remember reading that they did.
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:41:58
Man, why is it so hard to find a p2p exchange that supports cash by mail, but doesn't require ID?
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:46:56
But the reporting threshold doesn't directly determine audits, audits are determined separately, right?
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:44:41
That's part of what I am wondering.

@_date: 2016-12-07 09:06:17

I use Coinbase to buy the bitcoins, then transfer to LocalBitcoins where I sell them. I accept PayPal payment. I transfer my PayPal balance to my Chase checking account, and from there back to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 13:15:53
I didn't have any trouble with the friends and family payments, so perhaps I should restrict payments to that.

Gemini has lower fees. 
Coinbase isn't an actual exchange like Gemini is, that is, allowing you to place limit orders and whatnot.

Sure, but libertarians like to make it seem like it's the kind of thing that leads to hyperinflation, like in regimes that actually did print a bunch of money.

Using debt wisely is only rational if you assume people have healthy spending habits and good self control, which many people don't. 
There was recently a Nobel prize awarded for research showing that humans aren't as rational as economists like to assume.

It really worries me that there is so much confusion and no good information. It seems like literally everyone has a strong opinion one way or another, so it's hard for noobs like me to get a good, unbiased overview of the situation.

Agree. 
The Fed doesn't print money. 
The government only prints paper money to replace the paper that wears out, and besides, it's a tiny fraction of the money supply. 
The Fed regulated the money supply and interest and inflation rate by buying and selling bonds. 
You can have an intelligent discussion about monetary policy, but this isn't it.
