Wow. Sounds like an interesting book, I'll look it up, thanks!
Oh yeah, I grew up in a closely knitted community like you described. I'm from a small town where everyone knows everyone. damn I want to have that for myself and for my kids in the future.

You are wrong. Giving people money doesn't mean printing money. 
Please be reasonable. This will come from vat tax, which will fall heavily on tech companies who pay 0 tax. People will still experience some vat tax, so if you want shit on him cuz of that, that's fair, but it's not about inflation.
And btw, the current inflation is 1.6-1.8,which is below target 2%. In the current environment, higher inflation will be good to the economy.

Actually, if you are willing to give money, no one is checking. Try donate yourself, or ask a friend from another country to donate. No barrier whatsoever

Totally, man. Yang2020!
Sorry your life sucks. You are not alone. I feel this world is pretty fucked up. I feel what ay's saying before I knew about him. All I cared about back then was securing my own bag and make money, because more and more ppl will suffer, and I don't want to be one of them. But even if I secured my own bag, I still be unhappy because job is consuming, and the world is collapsing. 
I believe in him. He's a smart dude with smart brain and right heart. I'm a risk analyst, I'm having a hard time creating a stress scenario where he goes bust. I have my money on him. And a better future is right around the cornor if we are brave enough to figure things out.

Ubi is designed to put food on the table, to help those who are working 2 jobs and still can't pay bills, and especially those hard working ppl who will be broke in an automation dominanted future. 
If you want to buy btc with this money you are absolutely free to do so. I don't have facts and reasoning to support my following statement, but I think if our fellow people are doing poorly, I don't be as happy as I could be.

Sorry I was eager to defend him, apologize for being rude

This is just an article about him. That's a huge leap to conclude that he's catering crypto community. 
I'm very politically dis engaged, but if you listen to his interview, you can tell what kind of person he is. I don't know you but I would think we have more in common than in difference, so if you are interest, here's a link for you. Have a good night!

Awesome, I'd love to have this discussion. Not sure I get exactly what you want to discuss but here's my opinion. I'm a student of finance and I work for a fairly big institution as a credit analyst so I follow economy closely. I've been thinking about the issue he mentioned closely and sensing something is wrong with the method we use to distribute our wealth, i.e. the economy. This is just a system we made up.
Say we create 20 trillion dollar economy again this year, it's important to make a reasonable distribution on who gets what. There are 2 kinds of entities in this system, corporates and humans. Right not, humans are getting too little and corporates getting too much. And the pie is just this big, corporates take a larger cut means ppl have less. And corporates are enslaving ppl by having them taking on debt, controlling crucial resources, and dictating priorities in our society.
It's in every aspect of our life, and I tend to believe this system is the source of all evil. The struggle is real, the suffering is real. Frankly, I don't feel financially threatened, because my job will be there for me. But civil unrest is the thing I fear the most. If it happens, it won't be a stand-alone incident. I agree with Yang on communities are failing across the country, just by looking at the record earning of tech giants, financial services, and private equity (this is the craziest of all), you know if you don't own a piece of the capital market, you are getting ripped. (Not sure what I'm saying makes any sense, anyway ;D)

Sir. If you spend 1min google him, and please do, you will see he is thw contrary of 10issue candidate. 
I understand your feeling because I don't like politicians in general. However, he is a truely amazing person. 
If you listen any of his long interviews, you will see he's for real. I recommend Joe Rogan's podcast with him.

There you go my dude. See if you can stop before listening to all of it.
