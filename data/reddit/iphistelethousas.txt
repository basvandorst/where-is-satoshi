Say I'm convinced the oil price will go through the roof and so I offer to buy oil at $65/barrel two months from now (because I believe the market price will be at least $70/barrel by that point). Now, I'm interested in making $5+/barrel profit, I'm not interested in having a shipment of crude oil sit in my yard. So I say "Let's skip the whole you delivering oil barrels to my place and me trying to have a yard sale at $70 thing, it's a pointless nuisance. Let's just make a contract that two months from now I will give you $65 and you will give me the then current cash value of a barrel of oil in return", hoping that 2 months from now you will send me a net sum of at least $5 per [hypothetical] barrel.
No reason to do any business with actual oil when I'm only interested in converting it back to cash anyhow.

The problem is that the money will appear in your debit account long before the cheque has actually cleared.
It's a service banks offer called "cheque negotiation" (as opposed to "collection") - they just credit your account assuming that the cheque will clear and charge you back later if it bounces (which for international transfers can take weeks or months to determine).
Many scams work this way - they send you a bad cheque, you deposit it, see money (+$1,000) in your account and think everything is fine, you then transfer some money irreversibly "back" to the scammer (-$800), your bank notifies you that the cheque you have deposited bounced and reverses crediting your account (-$1,000), you paid whatever you sent the scammer out of your own pocket (now you're $800 poorer and will probably blame your bank for letting you do this).

Apparently they don't understand opportunity cost - doesn't make a difference whether you spend bitcoin to buy your lunch or other money you could have used to buy bitcoin.
