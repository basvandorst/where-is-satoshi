Uh... I'm talking in the last week. Same method, only took 30 min.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:26:55
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:01:24
Is there any way to speed up by paying a fee separate from original transaction?
I'm surprised sending with a Blockchain.info wallet didn't automatically adjust the fee to a high amount to make sure it gets confirmed within an hour or two.
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:15:54
Over the next weekend? What? I've never had that issue with bitcoin even at that fee rate, it would take less than an hour. I sent btc from online wallets I've been using for hundred+ transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:49:15
Ok, thanke, actually just read that same excerpt from a site explaining bitcoin and taxes. I'm assuming that means just the profit (gain) is taxed and not the total of the money received... because that would mean you could just be paying more than the profit gained/losing money. I don't want to assume wrong though. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:06:01
Each was 50-120 sat/B sent, maybe that's why. sat/B is satoshi/byte?
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:55:21
Thank you!!
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:31:29
No, it's not due to panic selling. These transactions were spread out over the last several months.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:04:44
There verification system doesn't work most of the time. I find myself hitting the send to SMS at least a few times before I actually receive one. The first request doesn't seem to reach them anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:00:23
I guess the upside of using a popular bank like TD Bank is that verification is instant. You just log into their system with your online banking credentials and it verifies it that way. Pretty nifty.
Are you able to instantly buy now?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:41:32
Well damn, I had no idea.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:01:26
Pfft can't even compare the two.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:38:05
You bring up a good point, I think of this often and I'm sure others do as well.
All I can say is that it's not always like this. It's not unheard of, but this large of a fluctuation usually doesn't happen. It's crazy, because no one really knows what's going to happen next, unless they're well educated and have experience with speculation of digital currency. I really can't say much more, because then I'd just be trying to pretend to be one of these educated &amp; experienced speculators.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:24:42
What's up?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:27:22
Why shouldn't I use Mt Gox?
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:54:47
He probably doesn't care enough.
Jesus, at the rate he's probably getting, it would be better to make slow cash on those GPT websites doing surveys.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:41:27
Seems legit, sending my bitcoin now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:40
You use Coinbase, don't you?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:19:21
BTC is 690 at BitStamp and MtGox is 708... It's been rising, keep an eye on it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:17
I'm guessing Coinbase will be happy to honor my .653 btc purchase when it was at $921.91. Oh well, guess I'll be waiting for the price to raise again, as should others (if they intend on selling).
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:38:19
Thanks. Any idea why some people say not to use Mt Gox, such as the guy above this thread?

Okay, thanks. Is it just me, or is the website not loading?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:29:27
Agreed, most of the time I just ignore the memes and they usually get downvoted pretty fast. I think we're doing good so far to prevent useless posts. Circlejerking seems to be at a minimum too.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:38:12
If you're not verified, does the money stay in your Coinbase account until it is verified? Or do you need to verify before being able to trade?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:37:01
On top of that, it's not necessary to send bitcoin back to BTC-E.... If in reading the first comment correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:36:47
What I'm saying is that no one knows for sure, but there's people who can make well-educated guesses at the very least. I can't.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:10
Thanks bro, I purchased them a long time ago, so I'm not worried about it.
so le edgy, mester troll.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:16:24
The worst part of this post is that people probably don't listen. They aren't confident and just panic sell. That says people are playing with money they shouldn't be... if you're going to speculate, at least use money that won't be the end of you if you lose it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:33:15
Works fine for me, just read the article. Never heard of CryptoLocker until now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:48:26
I started to panic, but I realized I'm not going to be able to tonight anyway. I realized I purchase these when they were hundreds cheaper, so I really don't have much to worry about.
And look at that, BTC is rising again.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:47:39
I often think the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:28:41
Thanks, I was thinking of doing something like that.

True that, although that's being a bit dramatic. I had over $43,000 in a SR wallet when BTC were worth around 200. WOOPS.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:21:11
I'd buy some at the current bitstamp value of $900. It might drop more today, but I get the feeling that'll rise back to $1000+ by then end of the night. Just a guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:24:25
Yeah, some dude returned 60 BTC yesterday.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:24:43
Makes sense, but what do you do if you need to sell ASAP and you have to transfer from Coinbase to MtGox? Doesn't it take around an hour to receive in your MtGox wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:43:29
Yeah, worked for the front page guy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:20:01
Good luck with your email. Just dropping by to let you guys know Foodler.com accepts Bitcoin (at Mt. Gox price = good if you usually value your BTC based on other exchanges). After 1 confirmation their system automatically converts it to USD (FoodlerBucks). I use it all the time, and I've seen it mentioned on this subreddit. One of their reps visit this sub.
I've seen other websites like Foodler and Eat24 on this sub. The more food ordering sites accept BTC, the more pressure put on the food ordering sites that don't accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:43:30
Not sure if this is another attempt at BTC begging, or...
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:46:03
Thanks, I missed this one as I was going through their FAQ and Q&amp;A.
Posting it in my thread over at r/CoinBase for future reference.
I know people in this subreddit don't like Coinbase threads, but I did what I could to find the answer first.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:17:52
They made an announcement at least a month ago about them no longer supporting BTC transactions.
I just did a quick search and apparently they have been planning this for quite a while, starting with a ToS addition a year ago stating this:

The statistics don't match up with the correct URL. If you try logging in, it logs your data and then redirects to the correct URL.
Nice try.

@_date: 2013-11-20 02:25:48
Not sure why this is getting downvoted.
I'll download it in a little while. You should add an alert feature for when prices hit a certain number.

Udemy has a free course about it. Take a look at their lecture vids to get an idea of how to design your videos and what content to include. They even have an app just for the course (Apple store, probably for Android too).
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:50:19
The BTC was sent to an online food delivery hub that accepts btc. This isn't the first time where it said it's going to take this long, but it eventually shows. Fee is 0 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:12:32
Not bad, phishing an indirect website can lead to users/passwords of interest on other websites. Too bad you got caught out.

I have a hard time putting my trust into websites like that. It's too easy for a carder to sell their loot via CD keys and virtual loot like that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:36:45
I've only ever used localbitcoins for cash deposits at the bank, and it's instant for most people. This is with bulk transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:48:26
Okay tip me real quick
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:26:05
How much does this guy make from CoinURL? I'm guessing it's close to a buck per thousand...?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:25:39
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:10
Thanks, I might have a couple questions later, I'll ask in this subreddit or message you if you don't mind.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:28:37
Have you tried their level 2 verification system for instant buys? It's one of the few options other than localbitcoins for instant buys in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:25
As a wallet, to exchange, or both?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:04
Get a new guy... Every transaction I've dealt with has been released to be in less than five minutes. Make sure to check if they're even online.

Are you sure? I'm not verified and was able to withdraw BTC to my coinbase wallet from mt gox.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:20:16
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:30:30
The other night. I've had that message, but it worked for me. Not sure why.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:11:23
Wouldn't need a screenshot to believe that story, heh. Like I said, it's not that dramatic. I'm speaking from experience in my post, that's what happened with me. It's really no big deal, because as said in the Pastebin, at the time the BTC was intended for one thing and I had no idea that it would amount to today's worth.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:17:47
Thanks, I appreciate your response...
When do you think it's best to sell? I have 1.2 btc and I'm not sure what to do with it... should I leave it alone, or try to play with the exchange market?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:09:10
A better verification system. They use a system many websites check to verify your identity, but a lot of people are having issues with it. They answer everything correctly, but the system doesn't accept it. Strange. Even I'm having this problem.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:40:01
Awesome, another website I can add to my list of BTC accepting websites. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:05:01
Didn't think about that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:54:36
Yeah, Foodler rocks. I've been using them for a while now, most of my payments are with BTC. After one confirmation you instantly get credited.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:37
Ahh, I see. I was going to try Mt Gox, but it looks like Blockchain is having trouble... 39 hours estimated confirmation time for a $20 transaction I sent earlier. Is this usual for a time like this?
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:12:58
Lol, what did he say?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:22:26
To be fair, the chart does note that it still rises in price.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:51:01
My thoughts: r/bitcoin is turning into a circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:41
I didn't know it was possible, I always send from quick send. God dammit, I'm hungry. Now I gotta spend USD.
Btw, what's the verification process like at Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:56:10
Alright, good to know. I'm in the US, should I just use Coinbase? By the way, what does your first bullet mean? I wouldn't be able to withdraw USD?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:50:02
I was expecting a post like this after seeing what's on the front page.
I have contacted Coinbase and posted in the Coinbase subreddit, but knew this subreddit would get me a much faster response.
Hopefully some of you realize that this subreddit is about bitcoin. Asking about Coinbase shouldn't be looked down upon, unless this subreddit plans on stopping all posts about exchanges and buy/sell sites for BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:47:01

If you click on WTF in the upper right corner of bitcoinity it provides explanations for the charts. Not sure if it's ELI5 friendly, but it'll give you an idea at least.
