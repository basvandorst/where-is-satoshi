Yes it does, he's talking about how Forth implements loops which is that it uses an alternate stack to track index and limits for loops so that the code that runs within the loop still has access to the main stack while leaving the alt stack for loop control. His whole point is that Bitcoin script CAN do this stuff, you just have to do it manually.
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:52:37
You're right. And so is @_date: 2015-12-09 07:33:54
How is that untrue for Bitcoin? Looking here:  there is OP_(TO|FROM)ALTSTACK which could be used to implement a loop.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:17:00
As a programmer who has dabbled in stack based languages, this all checks out, he's not even going very far here, just stating facts about other stack based languages.
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:29:27
I don't think it would required 1 block per loop iteration. You can already have multiple transactions in a single block that depend on another transaction in the same block. So there's no reason you couldn't include all transactions that are needed to finish the loop in the same block.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:20:17
Because when they thought a withdrawal failed, they assumed the Bitcoins were still in the source address so tried to re-use it for other withdrawals. But the address was empty because the previous transaction actually went through.

So the reason I used ledger is because it does a good job of tracking "lots". You want to know exactly which lot of Bitcoins you spent in each transaction so you can accurately track the gains/loss on that particular transaction. 
Using this script: 
Change line 8 to be: `output = subprocess.check_output(['ledger', '-f', sys.argv[1], 'bal', 'Assets', '--lots'])`
That script will allow you to "pick" the lot to spend each time you record a transaction.
In ledger when you buy/mine coins you specify the the exchange rate for that purchase like:
    2013-11-04      Coinbase Purchase
            Assets:Bitcoin:Coinbase                         1 BTC (Coinbase) @ $239.94
            (Expenses:Fees:Coinbase:Purchase)       $2.52
            Income:Sales                                            $-239.94
The reason the expense is a virtual transaction is because you want the lot price recorded as an accurate cost basis, the rate for the 1 BTC purchase may have been $239.94 - $2.52 = $237.42. BUT you also want to take your transaction cost of $2.52 into account so to make ledger balance everything you make the expense line virtual and leave the expense as part of the cost of the 1 BTC so that you aren't short-changed on the cost basis of that lot.
    
Then when you want to 'spend' some coins (0.5 in this example) you run the script:
    $ python get_sorted_lots.py bitcoin.ledger "0.5 BTC"
    &lt;snip all your lots listed here&gt;
    :: Lot use for 0.5 BTC:
    	0.5 BTC {$239.94} [2013/11/04] (Coinbase)
    Success!
And then you record your spend like:
    2013-11-04      BitBrew Order
            Expenses:Grocery                        0.4999 BTC @ $230.53
            Expenses:Fees:Miner                     0.0001 BTC @ $230.53
            Assets:Bitcoin:Coinbase        -0.5 BTC {$239.94} [2013/11/04] (Coinbase) @ $230.53
            Income:Capital Gains            $4.705
And as you can see, you took a capital loss of $4.705 ($239.94 - 230.53 = $9.41 * 0.5 = $4.705) on this transaction.
Ledger will complain if all the numbers aren't correct which let's you know you did the calculations correctly.
Also, if you re-run the get_sorted_lots script you should see that your lots are decreased by 0.5 now, next time you want to "spend" it will keep track of all the lots you've spent and use the correct FIFO method.

First I ran this piece of code (python):
    import fileinput
    import re
    
    date = ""
    for line in fileinput.input():
        if line[0] != "\t" and len(line) &gt; 2:
            date = line[0:line.find("\t")]
            print "found date", date
        else:
            print date, line
And ran it like so:
    python test.py &lt; bitcoin.ledger|grep "{" |tr -s '\t' '\t'|awk -F \t '{print $1 $3}'|sed 's/ /,/g' &gt; output.csv
(test.py is the above python code, bitcoin.ledger is my ledger file, output.csv is the output information)
So after running that, output.csv contains a list of all transactions where you spent a lot.
Here is a command to clean it up even more:
    sed 's/[]{}\[$]//g' output.csv &gt; output-clean.csv
Now if you load output-clean.csv into a spreadsheet like LibreOffice or Google Drive you can use the following columns for your loss/gains:
 * A is date of sale
 * B * D is cost basis
 * E is date of purchase
 * B * H is proceeds of sale
 * (B * D) - (B * H) would be capital gains/losses
Hopefully your ledger is similar to mine so that this stuff works. One problem with the above shell commands are if ledger lot names have spaces in them, the resulting CSV columns might be off on some lines, required a small amount of manual cleanup for me.

The reason I say (nearly) balanced books is that I couldn't quite 100% balance the Reddit Tip Bot transactions. There were some cases where I just had to guess on transaction fees because the records didn't match.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:00:48
Agreed. I wanted to try it and see how much of a hassle it was. Same reason I calculated "use tax" a few years and then gave up.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:05:12
Well, I didn't know it was a $76 loss until I did it. Also, having the ability to do these calculations is good defense in case the IRS ever tries to audit me (I am a small business owner, so taxes aren't as simple as just a W-2).
When/if I do sell my Bitcoin holdings it would result in a much larger gain or loss and if I want to be safe then it's more important to have the ability/records to prove the larger value.
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:12:13
Well, the point is that this can work with any transaction in any location. You can use a laptop/printer that have no internet connection to print out a transaction, and transport it via paper to anywhere in the world that HAS an internet connection, and the transaction can then be sent.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:17:46
The thing to remember is you only need to report transactions where your coin assets decreased. The problem is, to properly track the loss/gain on those transactions you need to know what the value was at the time they were acquired. So you need to know what happened with that batch of coins from when you initially received it, to when you got rid of it, and tracking all that is the annoying part.
If you've only ever mined certain coins and never sold/traded them, then you could just ignore those (for now).
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:34:33
Do you have any examples of your skills I can see? I might be in the market for some cat welding services.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:57:46
Yep, I had this issue with my Bitcoin taxes, realized I had moved coins I had previously bought in and out of my main wallet before going to/from an exchange, made them all mixed up so I couldn't show evidence of distinct lots so I did all calculations FIFO instead.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:14:13
Yes, this was my point. In the case where the agreed amount HAD a specific dollar value I used the amount of Bitcoin sent at a rate that was that specific value. In other cases that did NOT have a particular dollar value (where the invoice was in BTC, not USD) then I used the daily average on MtGox (via BitcoinCharts)
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:08:44
To expand on the claim that I didn't know it was a $76 loss:
The largest gain/loss on a single transaction was $206 and there were 6 transactions that had over $100 gain/loss. So until I did all the calculations it wouldn't be obvious that my gain/loss was so small.
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:34:55
I was definitely a subscriber at one time. My old email says it was from 2004 to 2005. Though I was a "free" user going back at least a few years before that. I usually have my desktop covered, but if I ever go back to looking at backgrounds then I will definitely throw some BTC your way!
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:32:17
because other exchanges didn't make bad decisions in their software like mtgox did
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:07:31
Yeah, I was being a bit sarcastic, but it is also hyperbole to say that it is "impossible". For more details see here: 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:13:55
Yep! If you got audited by the state they might request your bank records and then ask you to prove that you paid sales tax on every purchase of goods.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:18:47
The idea is less to track those type of transactions for themselves and more to be able to show 100% true records in case you want to or need to prove a huge loss or gain in the future.
If you come into a huge windfall in the future by selling Bitcoin at a gain or if you lose a lot of money selling at a loss, then if/when you get audited you have to be able to show ALL records.
You can't just cherry pick the transactions you care about because the IRS won't trust you, you'll need to show that you kept records of EVERYTHING or they will make their own assumptions about the truth.
By tracking every little detail I could possibly show the IRS that I kept good records and they would be more likely to accept if I claim I lost a lot or the proof of where my income came from.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:53:50
In case you didn't see it, here is more info on what I did for the tax return:
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:12:15

@_date: 2014-10-05 23:41:46
I'm not sure you understand what real inequality is. The people who could most benefit from Bitcoin can't afford to buy any today either, because they barely have the money to pay their bills let alone buy Bitcoin and hope it doesn't lose value before they get a chance to use it. 
The technological cost and security comprehension required at this point is also not enough to offset the ease of use of Western Union or something.
Bitcoin has a LOOOOONG way to go before its remotely usable for those suffering from inequality.

@_date: 2014-03-28 16:29:24
Obviously 10,000 transactions is daunting, but I'm sure you've realized that only a fraction of those are unique in their format. So once you have an automated process for translating certain transactions into the spreadsheet/ledger then you're done. And even if you find you need to change the translation, you can still batch-process most of them.
PM me if you need any help getting ledger working. I have lots of tricks for how to make everything balance that I'm sure would be useful to you.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:06:25






Yeah I guess that is possible, I had 45 in April, 38 in November and 17 in December, Only 1-2 each other month.
After doing the initial work I _could_ take care of 50 transactions a month with 2-3 hours work probably. It would be a pain, but it is within the realm of possibility.








Default rule is FIFO so cost basis would be 125.
If I was going to do more purchasing I would keep separate wallets and never move coins through my main wallet so that I could have proof that particular coins bought at one price were not mixed with others bought at another. (For large purchases I planned on selling at a later date and wanted to keep the cost basis clear).








Sure but then you are playing chicken with the pool running off with your coins :)
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:14:41
Agreed, but I think it is also an important skill. If you've never tried maintaining double entry bookkeeping for your personal finances I highly recommend doing it for a few months.
I guess it goes back to seeing my mom do it on paper for a small farm when I was a pre-teen so I've always been intrigued. I don't do it when I don't have to, I pay for a very inexpensive bookkeeper to do all the work for my business, but I have done it myself on-and-off probably 5 times in my life, so this may be very different in some ways, but in others just more of the same.
To repeat, I would not **want** to do this, but I felt it was important to at least know how to do it and I definitely want to share with people that it **is** possible even if you don't track everything early on, all the records are there on the blockchain and in your various Bitcoin related service accounts. I even (mostly) tracked tip bot transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:54:55
I was going to tip you, but I broke changetip when I tried to connect my reddit account.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:43:55


No, I did almost everything possible with it in a 9 month period. 107 transactions, 46 of which resulted in a loss or gain.




Like I said, 107 transactions. I used daily average of MtGox (though for 2014 I would use BitcoinAverage) for the date of the transaction where the transaction did not have an explicit dollar value (like a $10 Humble Bundle donation in BTC).




I only used the exchange rate at the time I withdrew the coins. If you imagine it like you are doing a service for the mining pool and you only actually "own" the coins when they are transferred on the blockchain to yourself, then I think it makes sense.
I don't think the IRS would argue that you are breaking the rules here because you never really had control of the coins until you remove them from the pool. This is different from an exchange where you likely converted dollars to coins at some point, you didn't GIVE the coins to the exchange so you always had ownership of an asset even though the exchange held them for you.




I proved by filing a $76 capital loss on my tax return that in no way is it impossible. 75% of the time I spent was figuring out the tools I used to make the calculations and trying to logically figure out how to make everything balance. Now that that work is done I could do another year in much less time. Even without thinking ahead I had all the records required to make the calculations so "not knowing" is likely not an excuse.
Can you give a very specific example of why you couldn't calculate Bitcoin taxes? If you can I will stand corrected, but I did it without any real problem finding and using the records.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:00:56
MtGox and CampBX plus purchases at Coinbase. 
I manually input all information into Ledger. All 107 transactions and many of them multiple times before I managed to figure out the proper formats to make everything balance. 
Beginning was cash to coin and back on exchanges a few times (losses), later in the year I made a bunch of purchases (gains). 
Yes, if I make transactions on exchanges, each sell is either a loss or a gain. 
I was lucky to take all Bitcoins I had in MtGox out in November so no losses there. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:13:13
What the IRS might ask is: "Can you show me proof that you haven't bought OTHER high value items with Bitcoins?"
To do that you would have to show that either: 1) You spent all your Bitcoins on the car or 2) You still control the difference between the Bitcoins you bought at $1 and the Bitcoins you sold to get the car.
If you've been making small purchases with Bitcoin along the way, you would not be able to prove either case (unless you have been meticulous about records like I am (currently) doing), and thus they might assume you are trying to hide stuff from them and fine you accordingly.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:09:32
Yeah see my comment above about "use tax". I did that 2 years and then stopped. It is worth knowing you can track that information down if the tax police come calling.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:40:34
Impossible? It only took me 15 hours to calculate my Bitcoin taxes for 2013. Will be way easier in 2014 as I know how to do it. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:20:31
I did everything with Bitcoin, a little bit of everything which is why it took so much time to figure out because I had to track a lot of different TYPES of transactions.
Early in the year I had bought and sold on exchanges a bit, then realized it was smarter to just hold, then later in the year I bought a bunch of goods.
I also mined a bit so that was more types of transactions to figure out.

Have you read the details on that page? It seems pretty convincing. All those bitcoins are from the same computer running the same software at the same hash rate. Started at the beginning and has the same performance as the genesis block, also none ever sent/spent.
So unless its someone else who started mining right at the beginning, happened to have the same behavior as the genesis block and never spent any coins, its likely Satoshi.

Simplest example is one that is charged on a monthly basis like you would pay for a World of Warcraft subscription. That is how 95% of online porn payments work I would assume.
I'm not sure about BitPay but Coinbase lists it on their merchant page, but  says "coming soon". BIPS also appears to support subscriptions but it doesn't seem to be as simple as BitPay and Coinbase make themselves out to be. 
I'm not sure about other businesses, but from what I can tell this is the checklist of what this needed for this woman to be able to accept Bitcoins:
1. Openly accepting of porn. You don't want to spend a bunch of time setting up account and then have it shut down later because they or their bank doesn't like porn.
2. Ability to do subscription payment that re-bills on a monthly basis.
3. Integrated with popular shopping cart software so that someone who is a self-taught web administrator, but not a programmer, can easily set it up.

They make a bad assumption that a large percentage of the 14,000 waiting for verification at Mt Gox are wanting to buy a large amount. I would say that the majority of them are just newbies that want the ease of use of Dwolla funding and the only way to get that is to be verified at Mt Gox.

By using a BTC merchant for everything you can you increase the price of BTC and thus make more of a profit on the BTC you hold. The reason for this is because some merchants don't just convert straight back to other currencies, so some % of the money you spend at BTC merchants STAYS in BTC thus decreasing the supply of BTC, raising your profits on the BTC you hold.

If the address ever actually stored any Bitcoins it would exist on the blockchain. You can generate addresses that are not on the blockchain, but for them to EVER have contained any Bitcoins they would show up in a search.

Also, I'd like to point out that your claim of "geared towards men" is actually part of the sexist thinking that I'm talking about.
There is nothing inherently "male" about drugs, tech stuff, games, gambling, etc. There are lots of women interested in those things, even porn is not just a man's interest. 
Let's first focus on making a safe place for women who are interested in the things we are already providing, much quicker uptake that way. They can then spread the word to more women, and maybe let them take the role of getting businesses that sell girly things involved?

Less sexist shit like this thread would help get women interested in Bitcoin. Women are just as capable as men of understanding the transformative power of Bitcoin.
The problem is that the sexism that exists in technology helped create a situation where the early adopters were mostly technology sector men who aren't always the best ambassadors to smart women.
So what is REALLY needed to help get women into Bitcoin? We need to foster better relations with the women who are ALREADY in Bitcoin, show them that we aren't a bunch of sexist man-children. Thus convincing them that it is safe to tell other women about Bitcoin.
Now I'm being a bit harsh with this post, not all the men involved with Bitcoin are that bad, but I do think that most men don't realize that the most important thing we can do is just create safe communities for women and they will take care of showing up on their own.
You and I know how great Bitcoin is, what makes you think that smart women won't understand if we just remove all the OTHER reasons they wouldn't want to show up?

The offline vs online is maybe not enough of a breakdown. There is an online wallet like blockchain.info that is totally online. There is a "on your own computer" wallet like Bitcoin-QT which is more secure, but not the most secure for long term holding.
What I would consider a real "offline" wallet is something like the paper wallet you can generate at 
You can go there, save the HTML, turn off your internet connection, load the HTML from your hard drive. Generate a paper wallet, print it. Write down the address but not the private key. Stick the paper in a safe. Then you can use the address to send Bitcoins to this wallet and in the future when USD is but a distant memory, take the paper key out of the safe and use it to spend your fortune.

This is great. The number one problem you have is you need to fill the database. And you can't depend on people doing that for you, it will just take too long and you won't get enough traction. The answer is to spend your whole day searching for places that accept Bitcoin and adding them yourself.

I think this a good analogy, but you could also say "Is like having the opportunity to buy stock in Usenet". That eventually was replaced by new forms of communication, it's still around, but your stock wouldn't be worth much anymore.
I love Bitcoin, but Mark Cuban was right, there are (likely) going to be future competitors that do it better eventually. So even if the future value is $10,000 per BTC, the future-future value could be $1,000 after its replaced by something better.

I agree it is *a* way to get some women interested in Bitcoin. But unless we can fix the other problems first, women are just going to turn right back around when they show up and are met with the standard tech industry sexism.
Imagine if we (anyone who consideres themselves a member of the Bitcoin community) all spent a few minutes a day/week to educate ourselves on sexism/feminism, especially as it relates to technology, if we worked to make the Bitcoin community an especially safe one for women we could easily grow our numbers to the smart, technologically inclined women who can be the ambassadors to other women who need more help understanding Bitcoin (who are just like the people you and I have to deal with trying to explain Bitcoin to friends and family).

Well, the distinction is thin. An offline wallet means the private key is only stored offline, most likely physically disconnected from a computer. To send money from an offline wallet you would have to put the key into a computer that is online, making it an online wallet and reducing the security of it. To make it secure again you would have to send the rest of the balance of the wallet to another offline wallet that has never had money spent. So its just easier to keep some spending BTC in an online wallet.

I don't know, I didn't read what they said at the time. My wife is not usually one to take offense easily.

You've basically got it, as soon as armory finishes syncing you'll see the money there too.
The important part about keeping this safe is to not input the key on the paper wallet into a computer until you want to spend/send the coins elsewhere.
Also there are loads of things you can do to make generating the paper wallet even more secure. Stuff like using an offline computer connected to an offline printer with the source of bitaddress.org saved to an HTML file and reviewing the source code. But at a certain point there is a tradeoff for how much time you want to put into being extra secure.

A really important thing to realize is. If you input the key of your paper wallet and spend part of it, the change normally does NOT go back to the paper wallet (and you wouldn't want it to, because now that key is on a computer and can be compromised). 
The change goes to an address managed by the wallet you used to spend part of your paper wallet. So then you want to send the rest of your balance to a NEW paper wallet that once again, you've never input the key for into a computer.

I don't think its actually that much power. It doesn't scale 30W for 5GH. There is some overhead just to run the system. I think the actual power usage per 5GH is more like 15W. That is still like 2.3KW per case which is something like 4x 600W power supplies. How much GH could you get on those power supplies with GPUs? 10GH/s max? 150 times that is not unreasonable.

I'm pretty sure when I started mining on Bitminter it took half a day or so for my BTC balance to update. It showed I was earning NMC but BTC was 0 for a while. I would just wait it out and if you don't see it change in 24 hours, then worry.

I think you missed the point. You can have a perfect source of randomness, and still screw up the shuffling algorithm. See: 
So what popular poker sites do is make sure to publish the actual algorithm that shuffles the deck of cards so people can verify that it doesn't have a bug.

Other's have asked this, but it bears repeating. Do I really need to calculate gains/losses every time I send $5 or $10 worth of BTC to buy something?
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:32:48
Neither site has updated so you still pay whatever transaction fee they want or have whatever arbitrary limits on transaction sizes they choose.
Those will NOT change unless those sites actively decide to change their code.
The thing about 1,000 bytes means that the new 0.8.6 client will automatically refuse to forward transactions across the network if the size of the transaction is greater than 1,000 bytes and no fee is included. You really don't have to worry about this, most transactions will be under 1,000 bytes. This has no direct relation to how much BTC you are sending. Unless you are combining a bunch of small addresses into one transaction.
The size of the transaction is generally described by:
&lt;number of input addresses&gt;*148 + &lt;number of output addresses&gt;*34 + 10
So in most cases where you have 1 or two input addresses and 2 output addresses (one for your destination and one for your change) then the size of the transaction will be about 200-400 bytes (so you won't have to worry about a free transaction not getting broadcast)
That does not mean all the miners out there might decide to not include your transaction in a block for quite a while, so it is ALWAYS prudent to include some small fee. At least for now, some of the next few releases may have some logic to calculate when it is safe to not include a fee.

Your focus  on "girly" things is what is sexist. Women can decide for themselves what  appeals to them. 
My point is that women would be interested in Bitcoin for the same reason men are, because they are smart and they understand the world transforming nature of the technology. It is sexist to imply that women would only be interested in it if they can buy girly things.
I've said multiple times in this thread the REAL way to get women involved. Once the women geeks are all over Bitcoin let THEM be the ambassadors to the non-technical women.

If you could afford to have that $2500 reduced to $0, then Bitcoins is probably the easiest investment that could have the largest return. Imagine if in 4 years 1 BTC is at $10,000 (which is not out of the possibility). You have turned that $2500 into at least $100,000.
