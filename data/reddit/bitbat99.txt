I kept 2% in a paper just to have something to look at in 10 years. But I don't think Bitcoin is going to solve humanity's problem with the money god any time soon. It's making it worse!
This is why we can't have nice things.

The network looks at the block interval. If it goes avg below 10m, it adjusts the difficulty up and the other way around.
The diff has nothing to do with confirmation times/mempool.

Bcash idiots stopped spamming the Mempool. Inb4 they start creating faux BS to keep their shitcoin alive.
Bcash is the worst thing to ever happen to Crypto. TL;DR Segwit killed ASICBoost (mining advantage) that Roger was invested in so that's why.

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:39:42
It's altcoin after altcoin, all being pump &amp; dumps to get the next person to sell BTC away. It never stops...
The focus on a strong digital currency (Bitcoin with SW and LN) has been lost, and the entire "strengt in numbers" idea is falling apart into hundreds of small altcoin all willing to destroy eachother.
It's a run to the bottom. Greed again killed all this. I hope LN will actually work, but if BitcoinCash or something like that becomes the de-factor standard... I don't want anything to do with it anymore.

inb4 they do insider trading before press release. "oh look random coin X goes up 25%, mmm"


My opinion on these;
* Bitcoin - Best, most secure chain around. Not the fastest, but the largest hashrate and community. AA+
* Ethereum - Proper PoC for a smart contract system, scales badly, Sharding might fix it.. Hit or a Miss imho. B+
* Ripple centralised, instamined token that can be censored. D-
* Bitcoin Cash - Hostile, forced (without major concensus) BTC fork, toxic community, driven by spite. Centralised mining. D-
* Cardano - No idea.
* NEM - No idea
* Litecoin - Second best secure chain around. A+ 
* Stellar - Open source Ripple (kinda) - B-
* EOS - Not enough experience to really give my opinion
* IOTA - lol
* Dash - High privacy, but the staking algo is somewhat broken. Linked to DN's so reputation can be somewhat shady. B+
* NEO - Chinese Eth. C+
* TRON - Just a whitepaper - E---
* Monero - A true alternative implemetation of "blockchain". Slow, but good privacy. Not user friendly (yet) B++
* Bitcoin Gold - Semi-hostile BTC fork that attracts GPU miners. C+
* and many others - Where's NXT at?

@_date: 2017-12-21 08:00:18
Nobody will read this, but I had to 
I'm disgusted by all this, this is all propaganda - literally using propaganda tactics to push an agenda. They are attempting to destroy Bitcoin from the inside out by diluting and causing confusion. Newbies are eating it like cake, old timers either fall for it, or realise what is being done. I'm done. Considering the amount of bullshit on all Bitcoin communication platforms there's 1 of 2 possiblilties: Either 1) There is a massive amount of fake/shill/BCH users on all platforms - I cannot allow myself to be exposed to such nonsense, Bitcoin does not deserve this - or 2) People are actually falling for the Bitcoin Cash thing, and Roger is "the new norm" - in that case I consider the project as a failure and I don't want any part in it.
Goodbye friends. I'm leaving for at least till normality has been restored.

BTC addresses have a checksum at the end, you can't change 1 or more digits, it will become invalid
You can test it here: Example address from Bitcoin Wiki: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2
If you change 1 digit it no longer works

To be fair, he said "32 mb block". "mb" is not anything, really. But if he meant MB or MiB. 
A 32MB block costs about 
56k = 56 kbps = about ~7 kB/s. 32 mb (sic) is 32.000 kB. So it taks about 76 minutes to download a 32 MB block over 56k. Actually longer because the modem is not truly full-duplex so handshakes and the works bring the speed down to about 6kB in real life.
PS Note that Network speeds are 1000 kB per MB. While a block is measured in disk-space (1024 kB) - so about 1% overhead applies).

polynomial time) includes all the P problems and also a few other NP problems, such as factoring and the so-called discrete logarithm problem. Most other NP and all NP-complete problems are believed to be outside BQP, meaning that even a quantum computer would require more than a polynomial number of steps to solve them.
There is some mitigation against an outrunning attack, if it still takes "some" time to solve. a) don't disclose the tx but give it to a miner you trust (this kinda breaks Bitcoin, but it requires pinky promise trust™) - and let him stack a few blocks on top of it, or b) use multisig 10of10 to stretch the amount of keys the QC has to go though,
This works if QC slowly (in matter of months/years) becomes reality. Like MD5 broke when rainbow tables came. But QC suddenly becomes magic... SHA/DH/ECDSA/everthing will be dead.
But like I said, it will make a lot of old balances (with a known pubkey) spendable. So either they have to be moved (Satoshi, you there bro?) or blacklist everything a certain date.
A shitstorm. Let's hope QC breaking ECDSA is far away.

this is not true? if the clients and /users patch for a max 128k block and the miners create a 1MB its invalid.is it not that lowering the block *cap* is a hardfork.

You can however type the address (starting with a 1) into blockchain.info to check how much it holds.

It doesn't have:
* Bitcoin's brand
* The majority of users
* A larger price/Market cap
* Most active community
* Devs (in numbers)
* Commits on Git
And now, it has near the same PoW as some random altcoin.

*maybe* but  even quantum has it's limits. Furthermore an address is Privkey&gt;ECDSA&gt;Pubkey&gt;RIPEMD160&gt;SHA256 (2 rounds)&gt;BASE58 . So it's quite some magic to reverse. Except the Base58.
Funny to say Bitcoin has only 160 bit security in its addressing, not 256. So there are a lot of private keys that fit the same address.

it won't 2 more years of bear market, just my opinion but it's based on:
* Too any idiots on board
* Too many get-rick-quick on board (can't blame them)
* Bcash is allowed to be a thing, causing distortion in the market
* whales will be whales
* Overbought market (on a 1Y timeframe)
* FUD is strong, morale is low
So a year to about 2 years left to cleanse all this shit out, and maybe, just maybe, Bitcoin will have legs again.

A very, *very*, small chance that quantum cracking of pubkey to privkey happens. If you move coins to a new address RIPEMD160 protects your pubkey from being public.
It goes like this:
    Privkey-&gt; Pubkey -&gt; (Ripemd60) -&gt; Address (base56).
So if you spend coins, the pubkey is exposed. If an address is new and never been used it's also protected by ripemd160 hash.

You can make small payments as well, but it's not meant for 100s of millions of micro (like sub-cent) payments.
And Bitcoin is not a "P2P Payment network". It's a *A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* - at least that's what it says in the whitepaper. It does not make any promises about scalability by design.
Blockchains are not efficient. They are secure, and you can built on top. But onchain big POW security means it will be somewhat slow. THat's why you have to wait 6 blocks.

De otro modo, es mejor simplemente comprar bitcoins en lugar de minarlos, y sostenerlos. (Con la esperanza de que aumenten de precio).

2X is not 2MB that's a huge misunderstanding.
Segwit (currently active) allows for 2MB (4MB technically, but not fair becaus overhead). 2X increases this to 8MB.
Forking to 2X blocks (raw 2MB blocks) will fork the network, I hope  I don't have to tell you why that is a bad thing and causes damage.

yes it does. a full node:
* helps block propagation speed accross the p2p network
* makes sure the mempool is fastly propagated, and the owner can even filter out dust stopping shit from spreading across if enough operators do this.
* helps other nodes and users stay in sync (as a seed)

@_date: 2017-08-28 13:39:09
Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:20:10
1. Mempool is being spammed? If so let them. Either it is legit transactions (that would mean Bitcoin is really popular!) or it's not legit (booo, someone is burning money, so it will stop if they run out). There's about 4BTC per block of fees, while a few weeks ago it was more like 1.5BTC. So *if!* this is spam, its about $10k per block, so about $60k per hour or $1.4M per day. Let's wait for at least 5 days to see if this is REAL or SPAM.  Bitcoin is already temp. broken (and so is Bitcoin Cash) thanks to all this tinkering/forking/fudding with the economy, there is nothing left to wait it out for a bit. If you really need to transact maybe use an alt like LTC for now.  Ignoring is best.
2. it's not on purpose, it's just bad design. Bitcoin will take some hits while Bitcoin Cash is still around. This can take years. Once mempool clears up a bit normal-ish operations will be in effect. Ignoring is best
3. He can do that, it's up to him to mine empty blocks. It does not really make sense to leave so much fee on the table, but that's his loss.
4. I know, the previous waves of trolling were amateur hour compared to this. This is some first class psy-op shit. Best to be ignored.
A bit pretentious, but as Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War








Best to do the opposite if this is an attack: do nothing.
Bitcoin will be fine. Hodl if you can hodl, never be overinvested, be honest, and do other things. I suggest a good long walk in nature to ponder.

Bob sends coins to Nate. What he does is, he signs a certain amount of the input to the publickey O of Nate, after that only Nate can move them again because he has private key H.
The remainder goes to a new address V, in control by Bob.

It's the largest (strength in numbers) by measurement of transactions, people supporting the idea, hashing mining power, market cap.

Don't over invest, not in Bitcoin, not nowhere. But Bitcoin is extra dangerous, it's very volatile and not as regulated.


Well you can't buy in the past, only now. Nobody knows.... But Bitcoin will be around for 100s of years (the last block will be mined 2140) so maybe it's fun to get $5 and give to your children's children for the fun of it.

But the media is not citing the source. A little bit of searching reveals this blogpost:
It's just a Vlog from a partner of ABN. It's actually kinda bullish if you understand Dutch. The media is cherry picking his - quite balanced - opinion about Bitcoin. He actually understands blockchain and is kinda positive.
The quote on all the media (headline of this thread) is at this time-mark. TOtally out of context. He says "Not *yet* suited ready to take over existing currencies.". 
He says buy, to diversify a bit into crypto, but remind yourself it is risky.
Funny, how the media pulls shit out of context.

That's 123 years from now.
We, everyone we know, are all dead by that time, sadly. Our children (if you have any) will also have perished, and our children's children will prob. - some day - mine the last block. Either for fun, like people maintaining old shitty cars. Either Bitcoin is long gone, or very valuable. It will be final halvening, and there will be no more block reward. Miners will have to live of only fees.

The private key? In the user's wallet. The public key is not disclosed until the makes a transaction. The address is public.

It's a increases the amount of transaction that can take place (30%) but it also fixes a few "bugs" that allow for something the Lightning Network to work (better).

Balances in Bitcoin are 64-bit integers, with a convention to a human readable form.
"a bitcoin" means put the decimal point 8 places from the right. It's an unsigned_int - not a float. So you can't cut a satoshi in half.
In your example:
0.048828125 = 48828125 Satoshi / 2 = 24414062
Ints are truncated in C++ afaik, correct me if wrong.

@_date: 2017-08-01 07:59:49
I have posted this as a thread but it got deleted. This is I think very important PSA.
A small warning to everyone. Mostly people wanting to trade/dump and/or move BCH for any reason. I have posted this to because this affects **Bitcoin privacy** even though this is an alt.
The moment the network splits, in about 5 hours, the 2 networks are identical from that point in time. Every transaction and balance is the same.
This creates a privacy problem. Once you start swiping or moving coins it's pretty easy to see what balance belongs to the same person. Let's say you have 3 wallets. Your mobile a) phone, b) cold wallet and and c) Trezor. You start moving all the BCH (or a part of it) to a new address X or to an exchange address Y.
By just looking at these transactions any person can quickly make the assumption: because they all end up in X the wallet/addresses a, b and c are very likely the same person **on the "real" Bitcoin network as well**.
Best practice would be: 
* Consider: Do you really want to trade or act right now? if not don't move yet.
* Do not "stack" different wallets to one single address. Generate new addresses on the exchanges.
* Be aware of the risks.
Even so, some people will be moving Bitcoin-cash that has been idle for years and years. Be aware that Bitcoin is an open ledger.
Thank you for your attention.

He also says "it''s not actual mining, but solving math problems".
Yes, I have to admit it is, but he didn't (and nobody actually I hope) thought there was actual digging into the ground involved? Just as Bitcoin is not actually a Coin. Nor a Bit. And a Wallet is not a *wallet* but a keychain.

Funny, he talks down BTC, and goes of a tangent that Gold is the only real money.
The single line that says it all, quote from the video (word by word):


Peter, I'm sorry but you are wrong, and you don't understand. Gold has the same backing as Bitcoin: trust. Value is a human contruct. Gold, same as Bitcoin, has **value by humans, expressed in other forms of value (USD/Euro/etc.) determined by the markets**.


That's just....... well wrong. I'm doing that. And by this argument Gold is also not a store of value because people also speculate with gold (look at the paper markets for Gold, tell me that is *not* speculative).
Poor Peter, stuck in his mind like a polar bear in a zoo, walking circles.

Watch a lot of videos. Or start here: 


That's good, it's a hard pill to swallow.


Warning, you don't actually own those bitcoins because you don't have the private key. Move them to a (hardware) wallet asap.


If you go the software wallet route (disk) you a prone to virusses. I would really recommend buying a Trezor. In the meantime, if you have a non-rooted smartphone (up to date and clean) you can use Jaxx on iOS or Mycelium on Android.
Warning, don't use Jaxx on Chrome with the same seed. Also **BACKUP YOUR SEED AS IT WILL INSTRUCT AND WRITE DOWN THE 12 to 24 WORD SEED!!!**

No, if a miner finds a nonce that fits the previous block, he's free to include any (or none into the block). Generally they include transactions with the highest fee-vs-size. 


By free choice


Miners. And not even the miners (in case of a pool) but the operator of the node that finds a block.


Yes, Yes.


People pointing hashrate to that pool will see lower returns, so the financial incentive is lower to mine. 


Yes, those are very expensive to run, they use a lot of power per hashrate.


You are free to do so.


The result will be that spammers will even throw in more spam (at low cost) making the network even slower! Just to fuck with Bitcoin.

It's really sad to see this. It almost makes me want to call the experiment called Bitcoin as over, and throw in the towl.
The amount of hatred towards  - what seemingly - used to be community members (non BCH) is crazy. It's pure black/white thinking. You either are Roger Ver's puppet or you are literally hitler (Core). The spam attacks are stupid, Roger claims to be nice and good but he's hurting an Open source project.
If BCH ends up being Bitcoin, I'm done. I'd move to something different, Monero maybe. Or Zcash. Something that still has its own merits.
Sad. Bitcoin deserves so much better. Sure, it's all unregulated, and fair game. But I've lost faith in part of the community. I'm done fighting or even engaging trolls and genuine users of BCH.

If you have 51% or more of mining power you can always mine the "longest" chain, but you cannot really go back in time. Because each block back in time shortens your advantage.
So you are 51% and you are 10 blocks ahead after a few hours. You can just go back 10 blocks, and re-mine them and you will come out longer than the 49% chain.
It's not a different chain, just a "fork" (but not hard/soft). The other chain is "orphaned" (happens sometimes now even but only 1 or 2 blocks).

What you are trying to acchieve is only storing the UTXO (all addresses with active balance). This is already done, but the blockchain itself is - by design - kept for history reasons.
It is possible to run a "pruned" node though, only keeping the last few GB of blocks and UTXO.

I see a problem though. There's a small group of 2X'ers, so it's very easy to coordinate a BTC dump, the price is high, so they get a LOT of USD in their combined wallets.
So, they hodl 2X *and* a get to have a lot of cash to prop up 2X (making it look legit).
The 2x offered to the market will be medium. The amount hodled will be medium. The amount of btc dumped will be medium to high.

It's more like undoing a few blocks backward from a certain point (where you got 51%). To mine more than 6 blocks backwards requires 80+%

Miners are free to mine any altcoin they like, Bitcoin will survive. If the need arises - I don't think it will - there can be changes to the protocol to mitigate the problem.
The current mempool is spammed by illicit actors, who will at one point run out of money. This has all happend before and will happen again.
There are way better (more stable) alternatives than BCH if you want microtransactions, LTC - it even has Segwit!

Coinbase is not a wallet, but an exchange. They hold the coins for you. For a small amount you could use a software wallet on a secure device like iOS (iPhone). Like Breadwallet or Jaxx.

Well good, but Bitcoin is not really made for offline use. It's for online use (imho). Also, what if the USD or Euro crashes (Zimba. style event). Look at Ven.


No. WU is about 1% fee so 50k would be 500 USD fee. Bitcoin would be $1 to $3-ish. There is some counterparty risk though, during the conversion/sending/conversion-back the 50k USD amount could have changed to 55k or 45k.


It's not slow, but I think you mean it does not have enough capacity.




Depends on the reason of the crash. If ECDSA breaks, pretty much 0.


Not really though, in case of Euro/USD it's backed by..... nothing. Promises maybe? Certainly not by gold (not since the 70s).


If you mean Mine a block (and get 12.5 bitcoins) - you need more than 1000USD. But yes, Bitcoin's high cost to mine is part of the distribution model, can't fake hashrate. That's why it's called "Proof of work".

yes, but that's power, kWh is an energy unit. Watt is power.

**Full quote for archiving**


Bitcoin shot itself in the foot by ignoring high transaction fees, long transaction waiting periods, and the near-constant 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.
Bitcoin Cash is a digital peer to peer currency. Which is the intended goal as stated by the Satoshi white paper. In fact, everything the Satoshi white paper proclaimed Bitcoin to be is what Bitcoin Cash is today.
Bitcoin Cash is not an "altcoin" just because you are a BTC-Maximalist.
If you're feeling pissed off, then you understand how the Bitcoin Cash crowd has felt for so long. The complacency and incompetence from Core devs &amp; Blockstream are the reason why all of this is happening. Bitcoin is losing market dominance because it is an obsolete and inferior product.
My response: 




lies, "peer to peer currency" is not even mentioned in the whitepaper. 


it's a shitcoin, sorry.


if Bitcoin dies, and BCH is allowed to exist as Bitcoin, Bitcoin is dead to me. the project will have failed. there are litterally 100s of altcoins *way* better than BCH. Even *fucking* Litecoin is better.

Bcash miners are also to be used on Bitcoin.

Quality FUD. The anti Bitcoin taskforce must have a fresh new budget.
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:05:58
a few things to consider/plan:
* Depending on your country you either pay no tax, capital gain tax (USA) or only savings tax (most of EU).
* Remind yourself that moving coins to an exchange to change into USD has counterparty risk: Ask yourself if the exchange is trustworthy enough to move all the coins at once.
* Beware AML laws in your country, 100 BTC will trigger a lot of red flags. Ask your bank before doing this.
There's a lot more to consider, but I'm not a lawyer so this is not official advice.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:53:29

@_date: 2018-02-01 19:34:01
Yes, and it's going much deeper.
* Market overbought by dumb money
* Altcoins without ANY value were pumped, and hundreds of ICO'ers needed to move through BTC/USD pool to get lambos. THe market is depleted of a lot of USD
* Altcoins stay way too high, people taking profits now
* Govt. FUD spreading
* Bcash is above $50 still
Once all the alts are -90% and BTC is around $4k maybe, maybe i'll retake my position
For now, let it bleed. Remember it was sub 3k in August, 6 months ago.

If a solar flare wipes out the entire internet, like - every last Bitcoin node - well Bitcoin would be least of our problems.
I don't think a global computer &amp; internet wipeout is a nice scenario. You want  food, medicine, shelter and guns &amp; ammo at that point, to get more food. Not gold.

800k signups in 2 weeks that need to verified. I'd say they've got their hands full. KYC/AML requires each account to be checked, almost manually. 800k signups in 2 weeks = 57.142 signups per day, or 39 per second.

Nobody will agree, it will be an altcoin to Bitcoin.
You do realise that bitcoins are unsigned_int in the code, so each "full" coin is 100,000,000 satoshi? If 50% of the hodlers dies, you still have 21,000,000 x 100,000,000 = 21,000,000,000,000 satoshi / 2 = 10,500,000,000,000 satoshi

No, the person receiving the coins would have to trust you to not have a copy of the seed.
You could do a 3-of-4 multisig with 3 parties. You, and 3 parties like lawfirms that have no connection to eachother, but you cannot own those keys. Now you can give that 1 key to 1 person with a contract, that makes the other lawfirms sign.

There is a limit to the amount of BTC that can be sold. The amount of USD in the pool is almost unlimited in comparison. They are litterally created from doing nothing. It's a one-way "leak". $10k in 3 years is possible.

Here's my guide: Do you have cheap electricity ($0.01 per Kwh) able to use at least $10k of power each month? And $10k to invest in hardware? Do it.
Otherwise: forget about it. Mining hardware is expensive and your rivals have cheap electriciy like dirt-cheap China hydro power.

Make a mining rig on a piece of wood, with a raspberry pie and a serial LCD or something showing block heigt and mining speed. Use Debian Linux and lcd4linux to show stuff. 
It will make him/her learn about RaspberryPi, installing Linux, hardware wiring and Bitcoin mining (albeit being non-profitable).

Each block creates 50 BTC... or 25 BTC a few years later and now 12.5BTC per block. Only coins in blocks that have been created are valid. And the block reward drops to 0 when there are 21 million coins. Every block is accounted for, there are no hidden blocks because each block fits on the one before it.
Where would this ghost coin come from? Each coin only exist if it was mined, like a crumbtrail.

I still can't wrap my head around 10M Coinbase users. 10 *MILLION* users. Where do they come from? Are these real numbers or fake clone accounts? 
an increase of 800 THOUSAND users in 2 weeks. I'd figure these accounts are mostly still being verified....
Let's look at the order book in depth. There's 3718 coins for sale, driving the price up to $7787. So if 50% of the 800k people wanted to buy bitcoins, they can buy 0.009295 coins each. ok, I know the orderbook has ice-berg orders and hidden market depth. But let's say there's factor 10 coins available..... 37,180. Still only 0,095 coins per new signup.
Question is, is the demand that ends up being HODL'ed overshadowing the emission rate of 1800 per day.... I'd say yes, by far.
This is going to massively bubble, and crash hard.

You can't lose a Bitcoin. Because it's just a number / balance in the blockchain.
If you lose the private keys (you burn them, no copy left), the coins become unspendable.
Impossible to recover.

People who actually HODL for dear life forever don't get to experience (or express) any value, so they'll only making Bitcoin more scarce (by hoarding). Bitcoin will still be distributed, more. People who got in early just get to spend some coins, but they can mostly never buy them back after doing so. (buying buying a Lambo would normally NOT do such a thing, only because they hold BTC it is made possible).
There's 3 types of Bitcoining:
* 1. Hodl
* 2. Sell coins for nice things, and buy back (0 impact on price)
* 3. Sell coins for nice things or cash out, but don't by back.
I think No. 1 and 3 are happing the most, 2 not so much. Bitcoin is getting more distributed by the users themselves.

Cool ida, you can make the blank wallet in batch, and use a nail + hammer to "enter" the BIP seed. The seed never enters any device (or is seen by the engraver).
I've got an improvement. Words are always between 3 and 7 chars long on the wordlist so.... you enter each letter "once" and finally give a mark on the length of the word. This provides for a sort of checksum (some words might overlap like "air" and "aria").

PS: Even cooler, you could do this without engraving. Make a paper template, with 4 "calibration" marks in the corners. Hit the holes on the Stainless, and remove the paper. It's just a piece of metal with "dents" at this point. No markings.
Need to recover key? Just print the template again, lay it on top, rub it with a pencil: magically your wallet seed appears.
All that is needed is: Stainless plate, a nail, hammer, paper, printer.
Edit2: I made a template to test this, **please dont actually start using this to store significant amounts of coins, use at own risk, this is just for testing and tinkering.**
Print on half an A4 or letter piece of paper:

There are other ways to "smuggle" blockchain data to the other side, for example by satellite (phone) or a modem connection. But your scenario is that internet is cut in half, so that's also out, right?
One could put the latest 24 hour on an USB stick and walk any machine on the other side of the internet, and the blockchain would sync in a matter of minutes. Or burn on a DVD and send through the mail.
The latency would be very slow, it would take very long time to get a confirmation, but it would still work.

Bitcoin would be the least of our problems. LOL. 24 hours worldwide internet shutdown would hardly put a dent in BTC, but would DESTROY the worldwide economy. 72+ hours shutdown would be a disaster, worldwide stock market melt-down. etc.
The most interesting about this is; Bitcoin doesn't need Internet to function. the blockchain would be very laggy but it would still work over a HAM radio link.

that decision is done in the human mind, but reflected by the markets. if 95% says (and trades as such) - that's Bitcoin.


it will survive, like bch, being a speculative altcoin. and a nice testnet maybe. and a place for some of the community to move to, so they can stop wining about muh bigger blocks.
I think 2X fork is a good thing, it will stop the endless mud flinging and provide a solution for both parties. Added bonus: Each side gets to sell the other side for free coins!

Because a PC (a Mac, IBM clone) runs either Windows (non secure), GNU/Linux (somewhat secure) or OSX (kinda secure).
But it does not have isolation of apps like Android and iOS have. Apps can't talk to eachother directly, they need to use API.
An up to date mobile device that is not rooted or running non-official APK's or DMG's is kinda the securest option below Trezor/Ledger.

It used to be about 3  (? )Trent engines about 9 (???) months ago, but the hashrte increased. No source, somebody posted this with math on months ago, the math checked out.
edit: found it 
These RR engines are impressive..
edit; so the hashrate went from 2 to 28 so it's more like 15 trent engines. I'm bad a math, so I'll just round that off to abou 20 engines or 5 Airbus A380's.

not for everyone. if money can no longer be made from nothing everyone has to participate - banksters and unemployed lazy people can't get "free" money from the govt. anymore.
But Bcash is not the final solution, it's just like any other altcoin. But it tries market itself as "Bitcoin" - the market clearly decided it's not Bitcoin, it's a spinnoff fork.

It's using about the same energy as 10 Rolls Royce "Trent" engines that power an airbus A380.
Now, look at the amount of planes in the air, thousands at every minute of every day.
If Bitcoin is ruining the environment, planes, by that logic, are completely obliterating, destroying beyond any reason.
Bitcoin's energy usage is niche. Climate change is real, but Bitcoin is a drop in a bucket. Also, hydro power ftw.

I feel like I have to comment.
My comment was meant as a joke, It's sad, but the Bitcoin community has tried really hard (and still does) to prevent people falling for scams. The PR and money behind the bcash project is very good. Also, it seems like they are actually getting away with it. *shrugs*. 
On the other hand, Bcash is free to do what they want with their side of the fork. Just like Bitcoin-Gold or any other BTC fork. I personally don't care. The only problem I have is that Bcash *pretends* to be what it is not - Bitcoin mainnet. It's not.
