The hope and prayer that no one finds a zero day in the crypto or that quantum computing doesn't progress to the point of rendering BTC's crypto methods useless.
As long as that doesn't happen, it's backed by public sentiment and an ever fluctuating amount of USD!

Ya, and if you buy enough lottery tickets you've gotta win eventually too.

Doesn't matter? Couldn't you have sold at $20k? That's like Bill Gates saying he doesn't care if he loses all of his money because he didn't have any when he started anyway.

USD is for conducting trade in the US and across the world. Bitcoin is for gambling for a chance to win a lot of money.

Except, TCP/IP works well and accomplishes what it is set out to. That is why it won't be replaced any time soon. 
Bitcoin transactions take hours to days and cost 10-20x more than the traditional centralized banking system.

There's no reason to think that it will ever go back to $20K, ever. Unless public sentiment continues in it's favor. It's not like there is a lack of alternative crypto currencies out there.
That doesn't mean it won't. But there just isn't any inherent value in it. It's not like a company that continues to pay dividends to it's shareholders and has a path to continued profitability.

So you want to invest in a business that keeps it's money in something that is extremely volatile and unpredictable? Instead of a strong government backed currency with hundreds of years of a proven track record?
Money itself is a bad investment. Cryptocurrency (also money) is even worse.

Bitcoin is as valuable a store of value as a beanie babie except for the fact that beanie babies were controlled by a central authority. 
And it wasn't that central authority that did anything to make beanie babies worthless. People just lost interest. As they will with Bitcoin when a more modern crypto shows up.

The 3 headers on the bitcoin.org website:
Fast peer-to-peer transactions (not fast, takes hours or days)
Worldwide payments (yes, this one is sort of true, but it is really hard to convert to real money in many countries)
Low processing fees (I just paid $35 to transfer $300 in bitcoin)

10-15 minutes or less via wire. Unless of course you are doing something illegal.
In the case of bitcoin, you are either going to have to rely on a banking system (like an exchange) to convert that $1 million in bitcoin to actual bitcoin (hopefully it doesn't take more than 1 day because you might only have $500k worth by the time the transfer is complete. OR you will have to send runners out looking for people who will pay cash in person in exchange for btc.

FTFY. bitcoin is flawed and will be replaced with a better alternative. Sure, crypto currency is going up long term. You just don't know which one it will be. And BTC doesn't have the technological chops to make it in the future.

I don't think you understand what hyperinflation is. 
Zimbabwe was hyperinflation. Venezuela is hyperinflation. A steady 2-3% a year US inflation is a normal, stable, and healthy inflation that helps to increase investment and dissuade people from simply putting their money under a mattress.

It's sarcasm, obviously.

I assume you mean cashing out enough all at once to live on comfortably? If you can cash out and do that, do it! You just got lucky. Don't think it will happen again (it might, but it might not). Almost every day trader ever that made it big, eventually went bankrupt because they could stop trading. They made the big mistake of thinking their trading prowess got them all their success. When in reality, it was pure, unadulterated luck.

That's more than bitcoin... since bitcoin has an infinite possibility of products that could easily replace it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:05:09
Exactly. I'm sure somewhere, someone was hodling salt until the day the died.

They have sunk lots of funds into businesses and ventures related to bitcoin that they cannot easily get back. So they have to preach that bitcoin will go up. Even if currently they don't really believe it, they have a huge incentive to lie and keep people interested in bitcoin.
