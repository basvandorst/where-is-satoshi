well the good news is this has happened before and it's recovered fine
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:38:04
Yea people buying stickers on mainnet is what caused the mempool to drop, duh
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:19:04
My problem is how many average joe's are going to set up a lightning channel to use? As it is, bitcoin is still confusing for your average joe and it's never been easier to buy bitcoin. Buying bitcoin and then having to get a lightning channel open with lightning wallet won't be mainstream for quite awhile after LN is production ready, once better and easier UI's start coming out. So since it won't be mainstream, I'm worried businesses might not hop on the lightning train right away (kinda like segwit)
Pure speculation though. Hopefully lightning will pick up way faster and way more than I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:38:52
most nodes only put in the minimum required to open a channel
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:21:45
I haven't heard of any lost btc. Most these people probably aren't even using it, just setting up a node with the minimum amount required so they can say they have a lightning node.
Testnet nodes are way more helpful right now
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:29:09
for it to be digital gold, people have to put a value on it. If people don't do that, it's just fake internet points like reddit karma
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:35:10
which generally comes to two weeks when we don't have such significant growth, but obviously will be shorter if we are currently mining 10 blocks an hour
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:14:19
That was when it was time to get rid of my facebook, when parents and grandparents had one. Best decision I ever made. Now if only I could kick my reddit habit
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:13:34
I can guarantee you most these people aren't even transacting and only have the minimum required bitcoin on the network. That's why I kinda hate that we keep having posts like this every day on the front page. While it might be cool to say we have a bunch of live nodes on mainnet, the testnet is doing WAYYYY more to help us get production ready. Mainnet is just a novelty at the moment and if some idiot on mainnet does lose money and then makes a bunch of posts about him losing real money, it could damage LN's reputation
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:31:08
the blocks would have to be enormous for miner centralization to occur. Hard drive space is cheap. You can get 1 tb hard drive for less than what one TX in mid december was costing us
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:04:10
Look I'm against this silly attempt to make btc look like the fork, but what you just said makes no sense. First off, how do you know this was submitted by Ver? Anyone can submit this. Regardless though, I don't see how being a felon has anything to do with trying to get a silly branch of the DoC to print something as valid. That's like saying you went to prison, therefore it's stupid if you think murder is bad since it's a law made by the United States government.
I just really wish we'd stop this obsessive hate over Ver. It makes us look almost as pathetic as them at time. Though I'm grateful for people like OP calling stuff like this to our attention so we can help fix the issue, regardless of it being a Ver project. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:28:33
Right now there's only like 4 btc on the network and it's not production ready it's just people setting up a node to have one. You better believe once companies start setting up channels with huge amounts of BTC there will be hubs. It's not necessarily a bad thing though, lightning will function with or without them
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:27:10
What makes you think they're going to make their own coin? Nothing he said makes it sound like that. So way to change the discussion completely.
Bitcoin is slow and expensive, no offense guys, but we have to accept that for now. Once lightning is production ready and really being integrated into bitcoin use, all these places will have an option to reconsider, no decision is final. But at this moment we have to accept btc is not a currency for small transactions. It's just that simple
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:53:54
The internet isn't decentralized, so i would sure hope that's the case
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:29:45
Dude there's 5 whole bitcoins on the entire lightning network mainet. You're high if you think this has anything to do with LN which is not production ready
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:57:56
It's not the definition don't worry. This is just a proposed definition and since it's been called to our attention (most likely by a bcher trying to brag about it) we should have no problem clearing up the defintion
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:07:02
No. People are just using btc less as the middle man as more and more exchanges accept other coins for pairings. Good for us, no longer clogging our network and btc is a store of value, not a middle man to buy your shitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:40:03
Obviously legnth of time (most things function on a scale where more time put in equals more money) is a factor but that wasn't really his point. His point was opening a channel isn't worth it if you're only doing a couple transactions. But with lightning the volume is a large factor of whether or not your channel will be involved
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:00:38
no we should care about the average, not a few blocks
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:53:09
because they've been working hard as fucking hell to make lightning be the best it can be, and they don't want to watch it's reputation crash because idiots lose real money on the network. It's a billion times more helpful setting up a testnet node. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:34:08
the hash power has increased significantly since then, plus there's less transactions being made as more exchanges add more pairs to the market
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:09:32
technically yes. but coins on the lightning network can only be spent through the lightning network until you close the channel, so while they are the same, they are indeed lightning bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:10:40
now is the time to do it since fees are so low, opening a channel won't cost but a couple satoshis
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:59:09
So OPs analogy kinda sucks, burger king isn't the original burger king lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:33:48

@_date: 2018-01-29 01:43:27


90%+ of the people here won't be able to answer that question. They just think decentralization = good because that's what they've been told. But then they turn around and complain about things that happened that wouldn't have happened if the network was centralized (I AM NOT saying bitcoin should be decentralized, i'm just saying people don't realize the consequences of being decentralized). Being decentralized has it's positives and it's negatives (as does centralized), but most people here have no idea what those negatives and positives are. They've just been told it's good
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:56:04
It absolutely can be a problem, but that's why the devs have worked so hard to make it where it won't be a problem
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:04:27
No, exchanges now have full pairing for eth, bch, ltc and others. The mempool cleared because people stopped using us as the middle man
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:33:16
Yea that's how logarithmic growth works, doesn't mean hash power didn't double
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:03:12
When the technology required people to start using other coins to trade on the exchanges so people could switch to the newly updated wallet, it's safe to safe the technology isn't that great. Segwit should have been required, not opt-in
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:13:09
Yea, it's been a mental challenge holding bitcoin. I don't even plan on selling it at all, yet I still watch the prices all the time. When I bought it my plan was to forget about it, but instead once I bought in, I got even more hooked to it
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:31:33
All you did was call him names. You're an embarrassment to btc, go buy some bch if you want to be an asshole
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:25:09
Not only that, the fee for the miners is going to be ten times what is was going to be if they just increased block size. This is scary shit. I want nothing more then bitcoin to be successful, but I seriously fear we are going backwards
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:05:36


no other company could handle this any better though
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:36:35


serious question: who do you guys hang out with that shit like this is such a huge problem you have to have your passwords and seed words locked in two dozen different safes with secret wallets in the ledger?
Like sure I understand this for SOME people, but I just have so much trouble thinking this is a widespread issue for people.
You're all just be super duper over cautious, no?

and Visas fees are way lower than bitcoins. Hence the problem we're facing
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:57:57
Yup the announcement would have had the EXACT same reaction in the market. 
Funny, all of a sudden people want Crypto regulated because they missed out. 
This is not what Satoshi wanted. (He also didn't want high fee!)
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:51:49
"Have you tried giving the devs another 2 years to sort it out?"
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:29:49
real bitcoin. what satoshi would've wanted, as increasing bc was his final wish. Core = high fees long waits
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:26:02
what's your position, high fees and long confirmation times?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:51:04


That's broken my friend
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:51:51
The market would have done the exact same thing that happened yesterday. You're an idiot. Not to mention the market has already mostly corrected itself
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:29
TIL bitcoin die-harders can't count. No wonder they like btc so much, they can't count the quarter of a million unconfirmed transactions, probably think it's just a dozen or two
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:40:08


that's because other crypto's depend on bitcoin's success you big dummy
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:19
so instead, lets have 40 dollars fees!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:13:41
Nah that's core. Satoshi's last wishes was what Bch did. Not to mention you can't discuss altcoins on this sub and the top 20 posts are about bch. 
bch = bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:20:25


I thought this was the whole argument against bigger blocks? Now all of a sudden it's okay it's 10 times more expensive then bigger blocks would have been?
HOLY. SHIT. THIS. SUB. HAS. LOST. THEIR. MINDS.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:53:28
I wouldn't copy it anywhere my dude. It's fucking the most retarded thing i've ever read. High fees are not a good thing, and if you fell for his spiel you should feel bad

yea! the future is fees! more than fiat!
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:06:47
all the ones that dropped out of accepting them and stated it was for that exact reason? Or is playing stupid part of the game here on this sub

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:04:27
yea well this sub also thinks super high fees are good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:22:57

*looks at date of tweet*
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:05:32
Go read the posts at the top, there's literally a guy writing a 7 paragraph comment about why high fees are good for bitcoin. Delusion at it's finest
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:07:16
Then fire up the lawyers. What are you waiting for?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:14:22
because they don't want it being related to the centralized banks in anyway, even though LN makes it clear they're in control
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:32:52
not really though. The fact it's something that is confusing and needs to be googled so often is a downside if anything
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:49
Then maybe I'll support them!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:16:48
People complain about a ten dollar ticketmaster fee, do you expect them to be happy about fees? Serious question

Bitcoin is no longer what it was described as in the whitepaper. The comparison just makes me sad if anything
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:12:40
don't forget fees!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:37
yup, you're a fucking idiot. Thanks for making that clear
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:59:35


The announcement would have created the exact same result. Get your head out of your ass. Please and thank you
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:56


how dense do you have to be for this to be proof? I got the notification for it probably 15 seconds after it went live, why would people not instantly pop on?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:32




@_date: 2017-12-27 06:19:15
that makes ZERO sense. The success of altcoins correlates with the success of Bitcoin. It's moreso the fact we don't want to see crypto lose it's purpose because the devs were idiots. They're literally celebrating high fees right now? Why? Because the banks are happy with them 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:30:51
no almost about it, they ABSOLUTELY do and I feel it should plastered on the sidebar
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:56
how so? would it be acceptable if they didn't have a website?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:17:33
so in other words, bitcoin is towards the light and not near it. Satoshi would be so sad :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:18
Yup that's one thing you gotta be careful of. The media wants to make this GOP plan look as bad as possible. The reality is this was already the law, the GOP plan just makes it more clear that yes your holdings are capital property

because it was Satoshi's "dying" wish 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:34
do you blame them? Who wants to be a supporter of a high fee crypto? At this point the fees are higher than fucking bank of america
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:52
should rename this sub @_date: 2017-12-19 21:54:58
you mean bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:38:06
why would you take your ledger with you on vacation? am i totally misinterpreting the purpose of these things, or are you guys are psychopaths who think 99% of the world knows you hold bitcoin and is out to get it from you
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:07:47
literally higher fees than fiat
banks aren't going anywhere with this current fee situation in place
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:50:36
how so? It's the exact problem LN is trying to fix
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:51:12
except they don't use segwit
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:59
the downvotes show how shitty this sub is
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:47
can't tell if you're being sarcastis, but you just said we can't do that because there's a chance of centralization, so lets do this which absolutely requires centralization
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:58:56
yea i think the dude is legit 12 if he thinks that was inspirational in any manner
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:02
so it's picking off useful features to spite the consumers and is super expensive to use? yea you might be right about that one
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:47:30
yep. lets face it, the fees are the fall of bitcoin. LN just centralizes bitcoin, so what's the point of bitcoin again?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:43:22
bitcoin doesn't stop debt
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:43:13
so your point is that bitcoin cash will prosper because core developers keep dropping the ball?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:53:29
How does the year not make a difference? Is it acceptable to not have a website? If not, why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:33
lol that's pretending like core developers have any balls to do something like this, and they don't - which is why btc is even in this position in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:31:00
Except  makes no sense when he goes and complains about 30 dollar fees. Rogers "shitcoin" is gaining momentum because it doesn't have those shitty fees. Also the whole "increasing lane size increases traffic" applies to REAL WORLD TRAFFIC. Not crpytocurrency lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:13:56


serious question. how so?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:28:34
"Why didn't they make an announcement!"
which would have made the EXACT same outcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:00:50

The people have little say. Yes they can switch to seqwit wallets, but the point of exchanges like coinbase is their accessibility, and it depends on them switching

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:39:20

@_date: 2017-12-27 06:10:18


HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. That's outrageous? Have you seen the price of bitcoin fees lately?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:30:58
yea OP could not have been more misleading 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:00:10
shhh don't apply logic to the situation, were trying to bring down the banks here!

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:02:26

The last peak was a major spike, involving lots of people who normally wouldn't have gotten involved (thanks to $$$$ in their eyes). If you think most those people will come back so easily, I've got bad news for you.
Not saying it won't happen, but the odds are against it's favor. And sadly it's going to hurt a future, better bitcoin because of this past year
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:01:01
Why? What evidence do you have that bitcoin will actually work in the future and become an actual currency? Bitcoin's biggest enemies are some of the most powerful people in the world. It's outdated tech. And it's been given a negative connotation time and time again. The odds are against you.
I wish you the best, I really do. But I really don't see bitcoin in the future. I could see something LIKE bitcoin, but not bitcoin. Bitcoin will become the myspace of electronic cash in the next decade more than likely. And honestly, I want crypto to succeed. I just don't see it happening without stronger tech, and a better support system than black markets
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:52:09
Why the fuck would they do it in a hot dusty warehouse? That makes no sense. most mining operations were very professional and being done correctly. Those cards would still be perfectly fine to purchase and use, especially if it's an EVGA and still under warranty just for backup
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:44:03
It wasn't originally a meme. People (mostly this entire sub) used to genuinely say it after things that were legitimately NOT good for bitcoin. It only became a meme as more bitcoiners became self-aware of their delusion
You used to get banned for saying something wasn't good for bitcoin. It was a shocking, ridiculous time, and it's a big reason why the big block debate got so heated due to massive censorship and astroturfing going on. It put a bad taste in their mouth, and pushed them to one side or the other
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:57:34
Have fun losing money! There's currently no reason to think bitcoin will ever become what you want it to become. It's already outdated tech as it is. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:54:15
but he was framed!! /s
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:08:43
Incorrect. That is the live value of your assets. It's how they're valued, you've lost money. If you buy gold at 1k, and it goes down to 600 dollars, just because you haven't decided to sell the gold doesn't mean it isn't worth 600 dollars
I get what you're saying, but it's wrong. Legally, it's value is it's current value
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:50:47
GPUs already normalized for the most part, then NVidia decided to milk the market by upping the prices of their newest generation. Besides those, everything else is pretty much back to MSRP
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:56:47
yea because they put it into the "12k dip, then the 10k dip, then the 8k dip, then the 6k dip"
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:56:11
it doesn't have to have government adoption to be a currency. The problem is most people weren't treating it like a currency. They were using it as a middle man to spend USD, or treating it like gold

THANK YOU. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. And honestly, even if he didn't kill people, he's still responsible for what is sold on his marketplace. Do you deserve a double life sentence for that? Of course not - but that's not the only reason he has a double life sentence

@_date: 2018-04-30 02:56:17
electric hand dryers aren't always on though. In fact, use a tiny fraction of the amount of energy just 1 mining unit uses throughout an entire 24 hour period, especially when you consider most are closed 9 hours a day.
And compared to a paper towel dispenser - the hand dryer is MUCH more green. Sure, it's not 100% green, but it's greener than the other option especially when you consider how god damn wasteful people are with those paper towels

Is it exactly right though? If dozens of other industries didn't make it happen, why would bitcoin be any different? And those industries gave many more reasons to push for it other than just "using lots of energy". AA said it himself, there are other things that are just as wasteful if not more wasteful than bitcoin
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for it and hope that is the case. But you can't blame me for having doubts. I'd prefer a solution that doesn't rely on other things unrelated to bitcoin changing as a result.

this is hardly market moving news. 
Also, by the time you're hearing the news, that news has already made it's impact on the market and been priced in

bitcoin is such a shitcoin it couldn't even handle a tiny ass percentage of the entire population wanting to buy in
