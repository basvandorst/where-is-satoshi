My mortgage broker, who is a personal friend and who works for a very large mortgage brokerage firm, tried to help me use my bitcoin as part of my down payment a little over a year ago. I gave them basically everything I could, full transnational reports from Coinbase, GDax, and my bank which is the entire paper trail. He told me that his brokerage firm did not have any idea what to do with any of the data. My friend had pushed the issue about as high as it could go and there was one last resort but I told them not to worry about it. But if memory serves me correctly it came down to inability to verify funds which makes no sense.
Luckily I had not sold my coins since I was waiting to confirm I could use them before I actually sold them. So it ended up working out quite well.
I wonder if the same would hold true for the OTC stocks that hold BTC.

[Here are some screenshots, I can provide more if it helps or maybe figure out a way to post the Google Sheets file as a template. (All  have been changed)](
I ran into this very same problem. I have had BTC for a while, but not so much that it had any significant impact on my net worth, that was until this year. I am a big time holder and I didn't have anything in particular I wanted to use the money for so the BTC just sat there. Since I could not figure out a particular amount I would need to invest or buy something I went about trying to think of the most logical way to figure out a diversification strategy. I ended up creating a basic crypto portfolio redistribution model. I set up multiple models with different risk levels using different crypto portfolio allocation caps of - 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 100% (always hold).
Down the Y-axis is the bitcoin price and across the x-axis for each model there are columns for # coins sold, # coins remaining, total remaining crypto value, total stock value, total real estate value, total cash on hand, a column for % of each prev column compared to total portfolio value, and the total portfolio value. Then if at a particular price the crypto holdings is larger than the threshold you sell off X% of your bitcoin. I just set X% of remaining coin but I am changing that to sell down to X% below the set threshold. That coin value was then put in the cash column although later I was going to redistribute cash to stocks and a cash threshold for that. But I was then able to see how I could have sold off as the price grew and the differences between the different risk thresholds in regard to total portfolio value, # bitcoin remaining, AVG sell price, etc.

I think you are confusing the ability to really maximize your income and decrease the overall risk in trading with the misconceived notion of enjoyment to make money for others.
It's all about diversifying your risk and by continuing to work you are not only able to earn additional BTC but you ensure that if things go south you are able to survive comfortably. If you are unnecessarily stressed or burden chances are you are not going to perform in a manner forecasted to cover your minimums. It's easy to make money when the market is going north, but try when things are going south or sideways. The markets rhythm and indicators vary due to so many different known and unknown factors, you might know the market now but that will change.
But say you earn $3,000 per month after taxes with $2,000 in minimum expenses. If you wanted to earn enough to supplement your current income and have enough of a safety net to comfortably trade you would want at least 1 year of expenses saved and not invested in BTC so in this case $24,000. Then if you could realistically average maybe 10% growth you would need just $30,000 minimum in BTC.
But if you can't go home after hours and make enough trading to supplement your income then I wouldn't quit your day job.

Wow, so willfully ignorant. You better bet your ass that whoever is taking your funds, assuming you didn't need a loan, is going to verify funds due to anti money laundering laws.
Not to mention selling all your btc for a home is a terrible terrible idea. How much is a home going to change in value vs Bitcoin? You would be much better taking out a loan and incrimentally selling off your Bitcoin to pay your mortgage. Where you might have used like 40 BTC @ $7500 could end up only being 20 or even less BTC if the price continues to climb.

$0 foreign transaction fee applies to you as a user of the credit card from your credit card company, but the store still is charged their normal tx fee by their payment gateway. That charge of $0.30 + 2.9% of total payment amount always exists. That payment gateway charge is not applied on your bill in a line item but it is a cost that is passed onto the customer (from the perspective of the store you are purchasing from). That is why some stores say pay cash 5% off.

While I agree with you, your post does not make sense. I have a bot that uses websockets feeds for live order book data to send email alerts when signal requirements are met. 
OP could easily post source code of bot that integrates feed data and Telegram API without posting the source code of his trading bot that may purchase coins slightly before signals are met that would send out a Telegram message.
Basically what you are asking is for OP to provide blueprints of his house which you would have to take at face value when in fact he could have a huge basement below the house that you would never know about.

Looking at [Stripe]( or [Authorize.net]( tx processing fees both are 30 cents + 2.9% of the total payment amount (which is absolutely passed back onto us, the customer) the tx fees paid were significantly cheaper than using a CC. If she made a $5 purchase using a regular credit card the fees would be around $0.45 so here in reality although $0.11 may be considered high in the crypto world in the real world that is a 75% decrease vs a regular credit card.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:26:35
$250 here, my average cost is now up to $450. Each and every time bitcoin price crashes it seems like bitcoin could finally be reaching a tipping point. Then each and every time it comes back stronger than I could have ever thought possible. 
I remember in December of last year when we were struggling around $1k and and people speculating a $5k BTC by end of 2017 were considered nutty (I thought it was crazy too). Then in the first half of this year we had the ETFail, PBoC FUD, and two seemingly dire hardfork debates and I legitimately start getting worried myself. Next thing I know we are hitting the prices the nutty speculators prophesied.

Well they did specifically state that their source wanted to remain anonymous. So I guess it all depends on how carefully the WSJ and Bloomberg validate their anonymous sources. It is easy to unknowingly peddle fake news as seen in the 2016 election. Both good and bad news agencies make legitimate mistakes. If this source knew what he was talking about will be determined by the test of time.

Not every user who signs up requires AML/KYC compliance. IANAL but they are only obligated to know their "customers" not their registered users. It literally just take a first/last name, email, and password to "Create account" but that act does not make them a customer it just makes them a registered user and increases Coinbase's customer count.

Before when I always purchased something it was against how many hours of work it takes to earn that amount, now I also ask myself the same question you do.
So it'll take me 20 hours of work to buy that 60" 4K TV or I could put that 20 hours of work into BTC. Needless to say despite buying a house and a car last year I have lived very frugally and any extra cash I have left over due to this gets dumped into BTC. Instead of fully furnishing my house as soon as I bought it a year ago (I had the cash to do so at the time) I can literally buy 8x more furniture today. Luckily it worked out.
Same goes for the car I bought, I was paid out through insurance when my old car was totalled. I bought a cheap used car and instead of using the insurance payout to reduce the loan about by 75% I just dumped the payout into crypto and took a larger loan. So now I am putting a little bit less into crypto each month as I pay off the car note.
Luckily I still have over a year's of expenses in cash on hand so I'm not leveraged too. My friend said I'm smart and lucky, but I'm only smart because I got lucky (crypto investments have worked out so far) otherwise I'd be dumb and net worth would be slightly less.

Coinbase also told everyone to get their shit off if they wanted to get their BCH. There is nothing to complain about. There is literally no cost in holding your btc yourself.

Not to mention the price never would have hit $1100 had Coinbase released their BCH.

And Google, Yahoo, or any other company's customer service can be convinced to reset their 2FA. Yubikeys are great but that still doesn't remove the human factor from inside these companies. Nothing is safe, on the other hand taking people's accounts over does take time and without some sort of assurance that you are holding BTC or could be a valuable target for another reason then there are probably higher priority targets. On the other hand if you were affected by the MtGox dumps then you are probably going to be a potential target considering email addresses and personal info were dumped. This Equifax hack may fill in some of the missing pieces of info for hackers to begin taking over your accounts.
One option is hosting your own email server but even if you know what you're doing it's still not foolproof.
