What if it turns out there's even more wealth inequality in Bitcoin?
Hint: there is.
The only redeeming quality of Bitcoin for the common man is its fixed monetary supply. If you're paid in Bitcoin, then given enough time you will eventually see your pay appreciate in value on the global market.
This helps savers, although if you think about it, the whole problem these days is nobody who is middle class or under has a lot of money, ever. People are increasingly living hand to mouth, as jobs in major cities are fought over and housing prices keep rising.
Hence, I'm not sure how much of a benefit being paid in BTC will be in the future, after the price has appreciated. It's only going to blow up in price so many times before leveling off, it will perhaps track human productivity gains after the tipping point.
That's not really beneficial to people without jobs, who never have any savings to speak of.


Bitcoin does NOT fix wealth inequality: it *amplifies* wealth inequality concerns.
Bitcoin does NOT fix a loss of job opportunities, or rising housing prices: it merely presents an opportunity for risk-takers and traders to cash in on our society's fucked-upness, but ultimately that opportunity will be reserved only for a minority of resolute, and likely well-capitalized HNWIs and entities.
Oh right, and wars of aggression are fought every day in digital currency. The entire digital currency space is at war every day, as people fight over investor capital. Physical wars are just an extension of this, and will if anything be a natural consequence of the rise of digital currencies.

OP's concern was that if it takes 10 minutes for the satellite to broadcast a block under perfect conditions, a 1 second miss in connectivity will cause the block to be lost completely, as the sat connection never rebroadcasts missed block data.
64kb/second puts an upper limit of 5MB on the max supportable block size. Could you increase the satellite's throughput?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:08:52


Not if most of the hash power is space-based.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:30:25


Does that work when the connection is unidirectional? I figure the idea is to easily set up a cheap satdish, which is cool. But AFAIK, those cheap dishes are *not* bidirectional.


How does it know when there are errors if no feedback can reach the satellite orbiting in space?


But it could nearly be 4MB with segwit. That leaves hardly any room for error. Can the satellite's throughput be increased?

Great! Then I'm sure you can guess who wrote this gem:


And this one:


Just some inconvenient truths about digital currency:
1. ETH hit 90% of BTC's market cap by doing the exact same things that can be done on top of Bitcoin through [Counterparty]( and OP_RETURN, while generally not caring about whether it takes a datacenter to run a full node
2. BCH just hit 50% of BTC's market cap by *explicitly* not caring whether it takes a datacenter to run a full node
3. And yes, Satoshi Nakamoto himself said *numerous times* that he envisioned Bitcoin scaling to mainstream success by running all the full nodes in datacenters
In short, the world of altcoins has proven Satoshi right multiple times over. Really, the problem is that people erroneously think if nodes are in datacenters, the system suddenly implodes and grinds to a halt, when in fact the only possible way this plays out is if a surge in popularity necessitates an increase in on-chain throughput.
Recall that such a surge will be fielded by digital currency at large one way or another, be it Bitcoin or something else (see above altcoin discussion).
In the world of today, a physician or paediatrician, dentist, or just about any healthcare provider has to spend tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on office space, medical equipment, and hiring and retaining staff. Despite this, would you really say *paediatrics* is "centralized"? Would you say *dentistry* is "centralized"? Just because it costs an arm and a leg to start up your own practice does not mean the practice itself is centralized, and the same applies to digital currency.

people who keep most of their net worth in cash are not rich people.
You're talking about someone with no investments. If they have $1000 in a checking account, they're doing kinda good. And that money gets spent, and spent *quickly*.
The only thing inflation has ever done for people like that. who aren't high net worth is give Bitcoin a reason for existing. If you had saved BTC at prices bought very, very low in the early days, that narrative has made you into a high net worth individual.
But that kind of game changing financial benefit has a definite expiration date.
Living in an all-BTC world, post-runup of BTC to its peak prices, someone with $1000 in the bank who is constantly spending it all as it comes in just to float on by will see almost no appreciable benefits from using a fixed supply currency.

Yes, you're someone who is taking advantage of the opportunity early. That's great for you. I commend you. But not everyone can or will do this. There can only be so many early adopters.


First of all, trading the volatility of digital currency will soon be no different from trading nation state currencies. If you're making money at that, OK. Again, I commend you but definitely not everyone can do this.
Digital currency is more like real estate in that you make money when you BUY. What is obviously true to me is the key is to buy digital currencies very, very low - before a price discovery phase even exists.
If you're getting into BTC these days and hoping for $50,000 BTC by 2028 per CNBC, at current prices that is "only" a 10X gain left remaining.


You can live for *peanuts* in America, too. It won't be pleasant, but more and more people are doing this. You can get by in America on $300/mo if you have no bills to pay. I also see no improvements in terms of government from S.American countries. Overall, it looks much more corrupt and socialist.

I thought the idea of a satellite feed was basically "live TV".
How do missed segments of a previous block get rebroadcast?
Importantly, assuming block size was 5MB, the satellite's throughput would be such that it would take 10 entire minutes to download. A sub-second blip of the signal would be enough to cost your satdish the current block. It will then need to work on downloading the next block.
So basically, this does not work without much higher throughput from the satellite.

Your full node only matters to Bitcoin "consensus" to the extent you provide liquidity and/or provide hashpower.
Do you provide either one with your full node?
Where is your OpenBazaar storefront?
Are you a market maker on Bitsquare?
None of the above?
Today, the only full nodes that matter, and this is still true *even if* we had a *1kb* block size, are those run by PoW miners (e.g. Jihan Wu) and those run by major Bitcoin banks/exchanges (e.g. Coinbase). It does not matter how small the blockchain is or how cheap it is to run a full node if at the end of the day you are stuck cashing out through a few large centralized providers who run economically important nodes.
The only possible way this will change is if BTC liquidity itself becomes decentralized through the likes of OpenBazaar and Bitsquare. In that case, you'd have a "long tail of liquidity" and the people running long tail nodes accepting/rejecting transactions would start to matter in aggregate.
Bear in mind the OpenBazaar founders have been very outspoken against the small block policies of Bitcoin Core, no doubt because OB can't be done at scale without on-chain capacity. And Bitsquare (rather hilariously, given its founder's insistence on sticking with Bitcoin Core) was forced to add new functionality where altcoins such as DOGE act as the base currency pair so as to allow trading to happen when the Bitcoin network is heavily congested. So Bitsquare doesn't work without on-chain capacity, either.
Increasing on-chain capacity increases decentralization by *decentralizing access to liquidity*.

Can you be specific?
What block size does a sat connection top out at?
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:24:13


But doesn't FEC involve further bloating the effective block size with FEC data?
The satellite needs to stop broadcasting an old block and serve the chain tip, as soon as the tip gets updated, right?
So if you have an incomplete old block because it just didn't download fast enough in the 10 minute window, then the satellite's bandwidth must increase to handle the load. FEC wouldn't be enough in that case.
If the blob of data containing the chain tip + FEC can't make it from the satellite to the dish on the ground in 10 minutes in its entirety, then I don't see how the FEC would be adequate for constructing the block locally on the ground.

So dentistry is "centralized" because Luke-jr can't open a dental practice on the Florida swampland with his *bare hands*?
Many people claim that digital currency gaining widespread appeal will disempower governments, but if that's true, then it doesn't really matter if full nodes are in datacenters, because the governments will be disempowered to the extent those datacenters are necessary.
Also, the government always reserves the right to enact blanket bans on digital currency within their own borders. They can play that card regardless of whether you can run a full node with a backwater internet connection. Also! You know that "backwater" ADSL connection? It's ALREADY a far cry from operating a meshnet or something over ham radio; you'd probably need blocks to be no bigger than 1kb to make real decentralization at all viable.

By your definition, 2009 Bitcoin miners "paid" for BTC with the *air they breathed*; they "paid" for the BTC with the *calories they burned* to configure their Bitcoin clients to mine; and of course they "paid" with the electricity they burned to power their machines.
All of that is not even REMOTELY comparable to an ICO, where money is merely transferred from your wallet to the issuer's. That is the key distinction: a transferrence of wealth from investors to founders.
Any costs incurred in the mining of BTC in 2009 were sunk, immaterial and certainly not on the order of what is commonly raised in gray market ICOs like Ethereum.
When people mined BTC in 2009, they didn't *bottle up* their electricity, vacuum up the air that they breathed and submit it along with a beef steak sandwich to cover the calories they wanted to burn and they didn't send it all to some *Swiss foundation* controlled by Satoshi Nakamoto in order to receive BTC in exchange. No, all of those resources were LOST. They were not TRANSFERRED. They were LOST.
You are trying to obfuscate the truth by playing word games with liberal use of the term "paid".


More obfuscation. Proof of burn creates "money/credit" too. For the last time, the key distinction with an ICO is that the money from investors is **transferred** to the founders; incidentally this transferrance of wealth from the crowd to a small number of founders is fraught with risk of investment fraud and malfeasance, which is why securities regs came about.


I didn't say that. I just take issue with calling Bitcoin an ICO. That is fucked up man, it's the scammiest meme I've heard in *years*. If you want to raise a bunch of money with a gray market ICO, go for it. IDGAF.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:36:18


The scale of **expense** has changed. Expense. We are scaling the EXPENSE of mining, we are NOT scaling the act of shoveling BTC from investors to founders.


Thanks, that's perfectly worded finally. Get your accountant to draw you up some T-Accounts so you can know *for sure* mining EXPENSES and capital allocations in ICOs are categorically different transaction types.
Expense != asset exchange
It's really obvious that ICO promoters like yourself are feeling the burn.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:10:49
You first claimed Bitcoin is an ICO because someone had to pay for the electricity in 2009, therefore scarce resources namely fiat currency were sacrificed in order to obtain bitcoin.
This is correct. But I pointed out the electricity burned to obtain bitcoin from mining is LOST, not *given* to a third party like it is in an ICO.
You *countered* by saying "but you still pay electric companies derp". To which I responded, the electric companies got nothing in 2009 that they wouldn't have gotten by regular Joe running his consumer PC as before. Anything over that amount was so small as to be *immaterial*.
This counterpoint of yours is also a Red Herring since the electric companies had nothing whatsoever to do with Satoshi Nakamoto's launch of Bitcoin. The two entities aren't related in the slightest. Conversely, in an ICO, the people who receive the proceeds of the sale are the *issuers* of the new token, as in a traditional IPO.
Now at this point, it appears you're just trying to redefine the common vernacular "ICO" to mean the inception of any digital token under the sun. Ironically, the phrase *ICO* came about precisely because of how closely ICOs resemble traditional IPOs.
You then handwave about how Satoshi got fabulously wealthy off of BTC, which is another Red Herring not to mention extraordinarily tone deaf. Satoshi INVENTED "blockchain": the thing that allows people to *launch ICOs*. Satoshi's fortune is well-deserved.


No. Tokens burned in a proof of burn event are gone forever. No one receives them. They are NOT paid to anyone. Tokens are deleted - POOF GONE.


*Excuse me*? Who was the "issuer" of Counterparty?

Do you want to live in a world where each and every one of your financial transactions is traced back to your social graph?
Do you *want* Bitcoin to be just another Facebook or LinkedIn?
Or would you rather it be possible to acquire a highly useable coin with strong brand awareness, which can be contorted into a highly anonymous, bearer form assuming some risk and expertise on behalf of the user?
What if you truly believed in the latter? Would you be willing to deny others the ability to use Bitcoin's blockchain for purposes like Ethereum is doing, even if it comes at the cost of Bitcoin's marketshare collapsing?
Also, it seems clear why governments would hate the latter. Even amongst tax haven nations, bearer shares are universally frowned upon for their association with money laundering and terrorist financing. This is gravely serious, gruesome stuff we're considering supporting by doing this. And there's an immediate downside that shills will rub it in Bitcoin's face and laugh at how we can't scale compared to their Altcoin De Jure.
But full nodes fundamentally sever the tie between you and your spending habits. See: [Social Cooling](
If you are forced to create an outgoing network connection to obtain your address balances, your privacy is destroyed, period. Conversely, if everyone runs a full node as a matter of course, then it will be normal for the Bitcoin social graph to be totally obfuscated.
IMHO this type of social graph destruction is what gave Bitcoin much of its early appeal. People saw that it was possible to own money in isolation of their own social graph, money which was not controlled by government or financial authorities. A truly radical concept.
