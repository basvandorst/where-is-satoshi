Lol good luck recovering it. Bitcoin is like yugioh cards... There's value until people start to realize how stupid and worthless they are. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:49:09
Bitcoin? More like bitcon.

How is this any different from wall street... Hope they tax you guys for short term trading.

@_date: 2018-03-31 05:21:20
Yes! Buy buy buy! Btc is the future!

You don't need this when bitcoin is absolutely going to be the future. Buy buy buy! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:19:26
Loving this right now. Just gonna buy as much as I can each day. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:10:11
Just acquire all btc
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:30:59
Kinda worrying that people here don't know how money works and talk like they have it all figured out. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:50:04
tbh i dont think BTC is the future. I just want to sell them to suckers and make gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:55:37
You sell right away? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:57:15
Yah... "wake up sheeple! USD is dead! It's all about bitcoin!" \*hodl to cash out in USD\*
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:25:09
I don't know....there hasn't been enough use for BTC to justify the price. Crypto hype has died and that was what's driving the price up with new money flooding the market. Now, there's no new money demand and everyone's lining up to cash out. No one's buying and yet supplies are still coming out and they're the ones keeping prices down. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:20:09
Well btc was worth a lot less than it is now. The irony is its not like any here actually use bitcoin despite how much people say bitcoin is the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:49:30
BITCOIN IS THE FUTURE! IT'S A LONG TERM PLAY!
*checks BTC prices every second*
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:34:01
Just gonna go lower now that buying force from India has been weakened. Fewer players --&gt; less demands --&gt; buyer's market. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:33:10
Great way to launder money! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:18:56
Current price isn't that bad compared to what it was last year. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:40:21
LPT: it's less convincing if you're writing an essay convincing people why BTC is undervalued. If you're so confident about it eventually going to the moon, you want it to fall so you can accumulate unless you just trying to pump and dump. 
I really don't understand why people who are so confident that something is undervalued would want to pump it up so quickly. If anything you want it to stay undervalued. Then again...how does one value crypto...
But frealz..why is BTC $6k and not $1?

Take a loan and keep buying more so that your average cost goes down. Hodl to the moooon.
