**Extremely** basic logic will dictate that people who live at home and don't spend a large portion of their paycheck every month on living expenses can afford to invest large portions of money on volatile investments and not cash out even when they see large gains. However if you are going to demand numbers here is some old data I found.
 .
2 years ago 65% of bitcoin holders were under 30. 18% under 20.
A reasonable person would expect near 100% of the under 20 years olds to live at home and a large portion of the 20-30 year olds to live at home. Based on this CBS data more and more young 18-34 americans live with their parents every year. If bitcoin holders in the same age bracket have the same demographic living at home then 33% of the 48% from 20-30 live at home, but I would argue its much much higher than that because people not living at home aren't going to have as much liquid cash to throw around than those who work and do live at home. So I'll double it and say 66% of the 48% bringing your total expeced bicoin holders who live at home with mommy and daddy to 49.02%. If that demo begins to deinvest heavily in the next 10 years you will see a crash.

I think the crypto bubble is going to burst in a few years for a few simple reasons.  Most HODLers are privileged children not saving for their own house or needing to make ends meet. Eventually enough of their life situations will change and when mommy and daddy kick them out they will need to sell to make quick cash to pay rent and others will panic seeing the abrupt downturn and all confidence in the coin will be lost. Technology wise it has no value as a currency due to the long transaction times and high fees so its only value is as an asset.
