I've listened to your music and it's awesome man!
Sometimes it feels like some Foo Fighters songs, which is one of my favorite bands! 
You sing very well!
Keep it going dude!
Just a question here, which software do you user for mixing and/or mastering? Because the quality of your songs sounds very professional!
Thanks man!

I used Electrum, never had this problem before.  
  
When I sent the transaction, I got an error that said something like: "Transaction rejected by the network rules: absurdly-high-fee".  
  
I tried many times and always with the same error, then I lowered the fees and got an error that fees was too low... So then I started raising the fees till the error disappeared.

I guess the next step is to integrate that with react-native so we can get a smooth lightning mobile app.  
I've been building some apps of my own, it's easy to port it once you have it ready on one platform.  
Great work man.

And if core implements a replay protection on their side, it wont work?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:41:43
Why they don't implement the same replay protection from Bcash?
