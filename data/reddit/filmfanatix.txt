Yes, which causes me some distress because I view bitcoin as a huge opportunity, and it pains me to not be able to take advantage of it.

I am a huge fan of cinema hence my username. I haven't created anything yet but I have a few short film ideas.

Clearly, but my problem is that I don't make enough money to make a significant investment. I only make about $120 per week from a minimum wage job and most of that goes towards college. I can only afford ~$10 per week of BTC, if that. My main concern is that by the time I can afford to buy a decent amount of BTC it will be too expensive.

These faucet sites for bitcoin are similar to swagbucks and other beermoney sites where you do tasks for pennies at a time. These sites are simply using BTC as payout instead of dollars because its easier.
Just sign up at an exchange such as Coinbase or Circle and buy bitcoins with your credit/debit card, or use Localbitcoins and buy with cash.
If you want to earn decent 
BTC online, visit r/jobs4bitcoins and bitcointalk.org for possible opportunities.

I am undecided right now, my real passion is film but a film degree is considered pretty useless and unpractical. Im deciding between business/economics/finance and maybe minoring in film and making some short films on the side and see where it goes. Honestly though im pretty lost in terms of career choice.

I think it's a question of believing in the technology. Short term volatility is not an issue because I am not planning on spending my coins, and if there is an emergency such as Greece where capitol controls are enforced, it would still be better to have full control over your bitcoin even if at that time it is worth a little less, than to not be able to control your money at all.

Could you clarify what you mean by your first sentence about equal share? Also, 300,000 bits is a lot more than $1

Cool, but I'm a guy and honestly I wouldn't feel comfotable doing that anyway.

Thanks for the link, these kind of ideas is what I was looking for.
