Bitstamp has different implementation of BitGo and only uses them for hot wallet AFAIK.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:15:06
Why do people point finger at BitGo if even Bitfinex is NOT blaming them?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:36:43
License is essentially a set of policy's and standards that company must meet and follow, this means...
- continuity plan - disaster recovery plans, 
- regular security checks - systems get checked and evaluated by third parties,
- financial adequacy - you can not issue new coin when you become insolvent,
- annual audits - proof of reserves
Do you think Bitfinex had this? -No.
I am no expert but at the end of the day it forces company in line with client's best interest. Does it not?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:04:04
You prefer single sig?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:26:42
They compromised security for sake of having P2P lending possible. Ownership of coins needed to change on blockchain.
You should never take compromise security over business.

Kim said this like 7 times already. Nothing new.

Have you ever transferred any coins from/to dark market? Even if you haven't purchased anything on the dark market, exchanges do have pretty advanced tools to track flows of coins. Other than that, I see no reason why they would not want your business.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:36:30
What is an alternative to Bitgo? Is there any other multisig provider for exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:12:35
I see your point and unfortunately, I do also have a friend who also lost years of savings and trading profits on fx broker that went bust. Difference is that the FX Broker was corrupt and intentionally played the system. It was deliberate! They were not incompetent to lose money, instead, they were smart corrupt motherfuckers with A-Class lawyers who got away with it. That is different! Bitfinex might have had good intentions but they would need someone to kick them in the butt every here and there to focus on security more.

Do you maybe have any browser extension installed? Any price tickers or something like that? There is a possibility that you have malicious software installed on your computer. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:37:05
...this is actually a good news?
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:23:34
your business practice looks shady IMO lol.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:31:32
China next!
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:20:54
Bitfinex will you implement multisig?

No way this is possible. 
Even if this is influx of Circle users it is no way possible. Circle didn't have millions of users! According to Google play, they had 500k-1m downloads. I am doubtful that every Circle user would migrate to Coinbase.

Good times :)
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:19:55
I am no expert but I would guess that asking for full KYC before activating your account eliminates a lot of risk. Limits are also quite low = max $300.
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:49:42
Don't know, can not test. Can someone from UK or SLV checks if it works?
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:46:06
I recon this is number of bitcoin addresses created on Coinbase and not client head count. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:18:45
Already back up!
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:34:32
Every exchange is a counter party risk, thus Bitstamp is probably one of the most- if not the most trustworthy. They also have financial licence in EU.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:34:58
well said.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:53:36

Barry's big announcement is probably DCG's acquisition of Coindesk.

This is external article published on IMF.
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:57:38
Given that Bitstamp is licensed, I think something triggered their due diligence. Best is to cooperate and they will leave you alone. They are just protecting themselves. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:10:37
She will support anything that is trending on google.
@_date: 2016-03-11 11:05:17

Congratulations on new phone.

That is quite a statement. What makes 2017 "the year"?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:09:46
I think you are fine as long as you are not using exchanges that are, well less known.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:25:42
Yes, trustworthy plus only exchange having a financial institution status. Recommended. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:35:36
How much are we talking about?
@_date: 2016-06-27 07:44:12
There will be lawyers learning how to code, not hacker learning legal.

@_date: 2017-01-11 17:04:00
I use Bitstamp daily, never had any problems. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:32:31
getting ready for new fat funding round, are we?
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:40:04
Isn't Circle the only company to hold Bitlicence? And they ditch bitcoin. What a shame.
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:39:31
Does it really matter? By the time you determine which is the right ATH, it will be long passed.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:10:55
Bitstamp worked
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:04:32
Is it fair to expect OKcoin and Huobi to be next in line? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:09:23
Bitstamp and BitcoinChina also started mid 2011.
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:46:26
...waiting for someone to say: "This is actually a good thing"
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:45:39
its called arbitrage and many people do even out the difference between exchanges already. Those exchanges that are still quite off the usual rate are usually the ones that are less reliable.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:12:15
did you account that fee is charged to both buyer as well as the seller?
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:10:35
Bitstamp is probably the most trustworthy exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:54:01
Account history.
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:57:03
You should ask yourself if you need it. If you do, then you should order it. 
I have it since couple months and works very well. It is Mastercard and yes, you can use it at ATM's as well. There is secondary verification at card issuer's side (Intercash) for ATM withdrawals. You basically send same docs as you sent to Bitstamp to get to second verification tier at Intercash.
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:04:39
Use hardware wallets! Simple and robust security! 
Bitstamp supports Trezor and Ledger so it makes it easy to transfer and trade also.
@_date: 2016-12-08 09:01:31
Back then, that was pretty much how you started a bitcoin business. There was no VC funding available. These days it is the vice versa.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:15:44
I always thought LocalBitcoins will remain a available in regions where regulation allready suffocated exchanges. 
I guess I was wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:01:16
How many of those accounts at Coinbase are verified I wonder? Companies in Silicon Valley like to hype their numbers to get better valuation. 
My client ID at Bitstamp is 6 figure, so I figure they must have between 100000 and 999999 user acccounts.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:44:48
Probably Jed Mccaleb or Mark Karpeles(someone in his name) cashing out.

Another vote for Bitstamp. Good performance and good liquidity.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:03:21
Simon Dixon also tweeted similar message. Simon is based in Hong Kong and probably has some insight knowledge.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:48:12
That is nice, but not accurate. Bitstamp had Segwit support for few weeks now.

@_date: 2015-04-17 10:22:03
Seems that way yeah.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:14:25
They are exchange with the longest track of providing basic and necessary service to the industry.
I think you can always count on Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:29:07
Oh Barry again. I thought he went away.
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:00:17
Bitfinex did not use cold storage/hot wallet setup at the time of the hack.
Coinbase &amp; Bitstamp do. Furthermore Bitstamp integrated two largest hardware wallets and is promoting use of HW which is very clever move!
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:40:10
That is probably because of FATCA

Bitstamp should be on the list. Trustworthy and reliable service throughout the years. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 05:30:57
If you read closely, Bitstamp was actually the one reporting FORCE to the law enforcenemnt on May 1st. 
BRIDGES was the one Bitstamp reported FORCE to. Then BRIDGES resigned 3 days later. He had to know that shit is about to hit the fan for him.

MasterCard is experimenting with a new technology to let people pay for things through a selfie.
"Selfie pay", announced on Thursday, uses facial recognition through smartphone cameras to verify the identity of someone buying something over their phone.
If you're buying something on your smartphone, MasterCard makes sure it's really you and not a fraud by looking at a quick snap taken on your phone and mapping it against a stored image of you MasterCard will have on file.
@_date: 2016-05-16 10:32:21
This is not new. You probably just hit a certain threshold. Just answer the questions. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:00:23
Looks like they are re targeting old users with promotional bonus. Existing users already had their fees reduced earlier this month -  
I hope they continue to appreciate their users like that in the future as well.
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:48:05
haha priceless! :)
@_date: 2015-10-30 11:48:25
So you are saying that Bitcoin IS pretty much China.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:19:53
Yet they are not opening back accounts to bitcoin companies and block transfers to exchanges.
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:55:20
Isn't this an old news?
