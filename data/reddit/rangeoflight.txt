Fleeing a sinking ship.
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:04:27
This seems like huge positive news to me.   
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:25:17
I would be surprised if was 100K.
@_date: 2014-05-21 08:36:39
And FINCEN considers it a currency.
@_date: 2014-11-18 04:45:50
I hope they do cut down on this because the Pump and Dump schemes by Big Whales is going to kill the bitcoin market and bitcoin price stability...and hurt BTC in the long run as use for currency and everything else.
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:33:36
yes maybe bitcoin will be $1000 in a few years...but lately there has been very little buying volume.  Maybe everyone will suddenly "wake up" and buy but if they haven't yet, probably not going to happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:13:16
no you think?  Just the fact that you feel compelled to point that out suggests you have major issues with women.
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:09:19
Top 5 is impressive, considering it is a relatively small country, population wise.  And I hear about Netherlands and bitcoin a good deal.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:51:34
yes eventually people are going to figure out how great BTC microtransactions are....may take awhile but it will eventually happen.
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:52:07
They can stop voluntary peer-to-peer activity anything they ant.  It's called throwing you in jail if you do it and they catch you.
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:17:43
The rest of us didn't lose $400,000,000 of other people's money, and do it through a lot of lies and deception along the way.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:49:31
Yeah I bought a lot and then when Gox announced they were insolvent and lost all the bitcoin, I dumped about half of mine and got some regular BTC back. But I still kept about half just in case they did "find" those BTC they lost.  So could be a slight windfall for me, but I still doubt it.
But the last buy I did was at .04 so I got 25 Gox BTC for just 1 regular BTC.  That will be pretty cool if I actually end up with 25 BTC from that.
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:22:46
"the" bitcoin?   Anyway you are wrong because it has long been known that a lot of the bitcoin was recovered..200K worth or something like that.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:39:43
"Evidence"?   Why don't you just google "coinbase scam" or similar and you will see what I'm talking about.   And yes they have thousands of customers so of course some people don't have any issues with them.  
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:59:11
Yes Amagi is better than Coinabul but still have their issues.  They seem a little disorganized rather than fraudulent.  But they have sent me shipping confirmations and then I find out a week later that actually hasn't shipped.
But they have sent me everything I ordered within a couple of weeks or so. I would use them again but not as enthusiastically as before.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:35:02
very cool. I'm almost tempted to buy it but his music is not my cup of tea.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:56:34
I kind of hope so.
@_date: 2014-12-29 09:44:46
Or could be Wall Street, and others, manipulating the price to kill bitcoin and make the user adoption rate even lower than it has been this year...or even cause it to go negative as more and more people flee bitcoin for any use. 
Most people don't want to buy or hold when the price just goes down down down, and much of that is to due to not for profit manipulation.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:15:39
It is the next to the last most recent version 0.5.17 and this happened two times.  I just don't get how the BTC can be sitting on the blockchain and Multibit doesn't seem them even though it has your address and private key.  And I reset blockchain and transactions at least 10 times, and still didn't work.   Also it loses the transaction where the coins were supposedly sent too. I am going to try other software and hopefully something works better...if not, I may be back because at least I was able to recover the BTC but just a lot of work.
Blockchain.info managed to lose even more BTC and a private key, so I probably trust Multibit more than them, but that's not saying much at this point.

Bitcoin is store of value and if it costs $300 to mine one, then it stores that $300 in there..something like that.  
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:19:02
Yeah not confusing at all to new BTC users.
@_date: 2014-10-17 00:50:41
yes and a lot of people have the ability to do that.
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:42:28
yeah Ubuntu is great if you don't need to use your computer to do much.  If you like to use a lot of programs for many different tasks, Windows is infinitely better.
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:02:40
yes technically as long as one bitcoin is worth .0000001 USD, then it hasn't failed..or if one person is using it out of 10 billion on the planet, then it hasn't failed.  But OP asked a dumb question which led to a lot of dumb answers.
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:52:35
Yes his track record is not great so far for sure.
@_date: 2014-12-25 18:45:32
No you can't.  
If you can, then where is the settings/option for this. I don't see it in there.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:06:14
You should have already contacted Bitpay and Coinbase and other payment processors to get an idea about their fees.  Not very prepared for your presentation..just saying.
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:44:30
It does work awesome for them.  They (the .1%) make obscene amounts of money thanks to the regs and protectionism.
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:22:32
Yes the world is f*cking insane in a lot of ways....just crazy but all you can do is work hard to watch your back.  And maybe lobby for change, although obviously doesn't accomplish much, in most cases.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:19:03
Most everyone is still pretty much saying that.  There are so many circle jerk posts on here, that it's pathetic.
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:11:31
yes if you go out somewhere far from a trail there is almost no chance that someone would find your buried cache.
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:21:10
You can have them pay with Western Union or Moneygram.  The fees are high for them, but not your problem.  
Have them use a secret question and then you don't have to show your ID.  There may be limits on the amounts you can receive and don't want to get shut down for no reason.
But if you go pick up the cash and have it your hand and then send the bitcoin, obviously nothing can get reversed.
@_date: 2014-08-21 06:03:00
Yes but how much money do you keep in your wallet at one time?   Ok so bitcoin is safe and secure for maybe $200 or so and not any more than that.  We all agree.
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:51:35
nice non-sequitur.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:37:27
And btw, you sheep are playing into the gov't and the Power Elite's hands...they arrest Shrem on trumped up bullshit charges and all of you assume he's guilty of something bad because the FBI told you he is.
You are all an embarrassment to the forward thinking Libertarian beliefs that bitcoin is largely about.   You are being played and you are too dumb to realize it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:07:26
Speculation is not the same as "gambling" but great post overall and you made some excellent points.
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:06:30
Yes it's funny how people bullish on bitcoin put it at 100% probability that it sold for above market value.
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:25:06
yes that is a fact.  even having your money in US$ carries some risk. Everything carries some risk and it's a question of risk vs reward and asset allocation.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:27:41
People could abuse the system by buying something with BTC and getting USD in return just to be able to cash out their bitcoin.  Also if you give someone more than $1000 in a day for their BTC, then you are supposed to register as a money transmitter. I don't blame merchants for not wanting to deal with this.
And if you give returns in BTC, then of course people would return items they are happy with if the BTC price spikes in a short period of time.
@_date: 2014-04-20 07:25:48
If this is really Demonoid and it stays up for awhile, I will definitely throw them some BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:00:32
so why does it matter what you happen to consider "established"...bitcoin is good enough for me and many others.
@_date: 2014-11-26 08:28:58
such a stale joke at this point yet small minds can't let it go
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:23:16
Yes there are only so many people on the planet so exponential growth can't continue forever, at least as far as adoption rates go.  Growth has slowed and the question is how much.
@_date: 2014-12-29 09:47:43
problem is that daily selling pressure is, at minimum $1 million per day, from miners selling their BTC.   New user adoption is stagnant.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:18:45
maybe because he is smarter than you and isn't a buy and hold retard.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:42:11
He just seems extra friendly to regulation, in general, going by his public comments in the past.
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:15:14
yes it's certainly not just americans....you probably have the same % of dumb americans as in any other country.  Well Asian countries probably have slighter higher avg IQ and African countries slightly lower but still true that variation in intelligence everywhere and plenty of stupid to go around.
I've also got to think that avg bitcoiners IQ is above avg though...probably 105 at least.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:42:46
Anyone who owns any BTC should be concerned about the price.
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:45:40
it's ok..just pay closer attention next time and you may get it.

CONbase is just about the most incompetent and evil company in the bitcoin biz.  You just found out what many of us already know.
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:46:42
Yes "it's the law".  And a lot of laws are designed to steal from people.  Legal and ethical are often totally different things.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:26:12
good customer service and honest dealings with customers.  Crooked Conbase fails miserably there.
@_date: 2014-10-16 05:26:44
I wouldn't bother risking even 10 minute delay with 11.5 million to save 4 cents.  "probably" isn't worth it.  But you make a good point.
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:05:14
The price isn't moving because it is NOT huge news.
Newegg or Amazon accepting bitcoin would be "huge" news.  
China further restricting bitcoin is "huge" news.
This is very minor good news.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:54:53
getting in your car and driving anywhere is "gambling" too because you could get into car accident and die...real % chance there.  Same with losing  your money trading/investing.
So investing is not "gambling" if you do it intelligently.

@_date: 2014-02-27 16:54:36
The price doesn't go up because suddenly there is news that coins are destroyed...not for long at least.  It is supply and demand and any destoryed coins are already priced into the market price, simply by not being available to be sold.
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:05:59
They are crooks and have screwed up over several of my friends.  Also if they get over 50% of the hashing again, they could bring all of bitcoin crashing down...look elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:55:14
Yes if the bitcoins are still in the address owned by Mt Gox and Karpeles, then saying "they don't have the coins" is deceptive and incorrect.
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:59:31
how how could you miss it?
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:02:08
Nice...they probably get about $20 in bitcoin sales per month, so very bold move to keep it all as bitcoin and not convert to fiat.  
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:46:29
yeah bitcoin will go mainstream...no problem.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:40:54
Amagi is very disorganized and had some issues with my orders, but they always do deliver and I continue to support them.  I would recommend them to others but don't expect everything to go smoothly, necessarily.
@_date: 2014-01-18 15:08:20
I'm sure they have never thought of this and your petition will really help.
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:46:29
That fat f&amp;ck needs to STFU.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:41:30
Yes they do lose time and they do lose money.   
And credit card fraud and fees lead to much higher prices for customers..they pay more than they would with a system not full of so much fraud.
Bitcoin has its drawbacks too, but sorry, that doesn't erase those of CCs.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:54:19
The question is who he bought it from and if it was anonymous or not.  If the seller was a registered currency exchanger and did everything by the book, then would have to get his SSN# and ID, etc, etc.  But the dude could have just sold for cash and no records, etc.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:53:00
you are right.  US and China are the only two countries in the world...at least the only two that seem to matter with bitcoin price right now.
(And yes that is a slight exaggeration, but only SLIGHT)
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:31:52
Damn the power of a pretty face and nice body (and youth) never ceases to amaze me.  I am affected by it just as much of course...just interesting on some level.
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:34:12
Moving at a snail's pace.  2014 was horrible for merchant adoption and probably worse for consumer adoption. 
I hope the consumer base for bitcoin is not shrinking.but may not grow much larger than where it is now.
@_date: 2014-09-03 02:20:27
This is why I don't get why people are so into paper wallets that can be seized or stolen (or burn up) or whatever.   I use cold storage, but just save the jpg of the paper wallet and encrypt it with PGP and have it stored in various places.  So much safer than a piece of paper.  You might as well just hold cash.
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:56:07
The ripple trading client has been the worth piece of sh*t since pretty much forever.  They just could never get it together and that's a big reason why they are failing.   I've never seen such a software clusterf*ck before.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:13:54
Yes just change human DNA and you will solve the problem.  You can start working on the DNA of golddigger women after you finish with the DNA of men who like hot chicks for what they are.
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:47:25
Yes if you didn't want to fly with a bunch of cash (or Pesos), you could convert to bitcoin before you leave and after you return.   That way would not have all that cash on the plane....cash that the "authorities" could potentially seize or hassle you over if they want to.
The trick of course is buying BTC for a good rate before you leave and then selling it in Argentina for a good rate and then buying it back with pesos there and selling it for $s when you get home.  
You can post ads on localbitcoins and mycelium to help with this but it would take a bit of work...but might not be bad and you could even make a profit along the way.  
The trickiest part, I think, would be figuring out how safe Argentina is because you dont' want to get robbed when you do LBC trade there.
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:57:42
that's because people want their asset to grow in value, not decrease.  Of course if it on a downtrend, people don't want to buy.  that would be dumb.  And of course smart to buy in an uptrend.  But today and sell tomorrow for more.

Poor analogy although I know it is an attempt at humor. Too soon though.

Derrr..I be all confused.
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:19:06
Yes perhaps you are joking but it will be a big deal once people are arrested and prosecuted in NY after these regs pass.  It will really hurt bitcoin adoption rates...well at least when other US States do similar.
And yes I know the US is only a small % of the world population.  But has huge influence and effect on the BTC price, just like China did.  
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:30:03
yes exactly...bitcoin is the best way to move big $ across borders but only danger is it tanking before you can convert back to fiat at some point.
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:02:36
I cleaned up on that giveaway. I think at the XRP peak, the $50,000 XRP they gave away for free on bitcointalk was worth about $4000.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:57:48
the poster itself was vandalism of a sort.
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:44:07
they can call the police, who will hassle you.  It happened to a friend who did a bitcoin trade in a bank.   The bank thought it looked suspicious so called the cops and they stopped the person and seized their cash, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:57:22
or for trading the bitcoin for gift cards or something else....the USD aspect is probably the technicality they bust you on, although "'m sure they could find another one if they wanted.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:23:23
I have considered it and researched it, but have not pulled the trigger and placed an order..still not sure.
First of all, even with all my research, I still don't understand how it works or what kind of password you are able to put on it and how you restore your "wallet" if it breaks or gets stolen (or lost).   I'm sure there's a way to do it but not sure.
They need some better informative videos or info on their site to answer questions like these. 
Also I just think having paper wallets encrypted on USB drives and such is more secure than a physical device that could be stolen or seized.  So this is a drawback.
The main advantage would be being able to spend directly from cold storage more easily.   Right now I use mycellium in conjunction with paper wallet and seems to work fine...only danger is mycellium stealing private key or phone malware stealing it from mycellium but taking that risk at the moment.
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:00:24
yes you are a noob because you didn't give us nearly enough information to answer your question.  If is a miner from a year ago that has a market value of $20, then he is a fool. If he bought a brand new rig with market value of $10,000 then he will probably make money.
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:41:39

A:  "Honest answer... HARD."
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:01:35
it works on google.com for me. I just tried it. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:33:40
IRS classifies bitcoin as "property"...so they can f*ck you..
FinCEN classifies bitcoin as "currency"...so they can f*ck you..
Lawsky classifies bitcoin like a "stock"...so he can f*ck you...
They will reclassify it to whatever is convenient to them at the moment and switch back and forth between them as necessary...to f*ck you better.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:21:58
Why should they hold any of it?   Their business is not speculating in the prices of volatile assets.
The point is that their customers can pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:00:51
That is too much work, even for me.  It becomes a full time job to protect your BTC.  But yes if you have a lot, it's worth it, but just such a huge project.   
But this is why bitcoin isn't growing in adoption. 99% of the people out there aren't going to go to such lengths to protect their money...they just aren't.
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:56:59
Bitfinex and BTC-e also are find with taking US customers.  Those are the two other largest exchanges of course.

is $2 a "micro" transaction?  I think most about it being 10 cents or so.
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:54:33
Ok I started a new thread and suggested it:
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:14:50
Yes "little easier" is correct..saves you having to go through the effort of pulling phone out of your pocket.
But that is cool and thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:44:59
you are a big part of the problem.  Make a spreadsheet and figure out what a bad deal you are getting.  You are better off just buying bitcoin yourself or your own mining equipment or most anything else.
Yes you should act in your own economic self interest, both short-term and long-term, but you aren't doing so currently.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:43:13
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:24:22
Yes it is.  Fincen says it is.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:40:51
yes I don't understand the technical aspects of this but destroy them sounds rational at this point.  They are trying to destroy bitcoin so we try to destory them in self defense.
Thank you for the help in this fight.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:56:50
"Unknown" used to be a relatively small sliver but growing more and more. 
We usually worry about one of the mining pools having too much % of hashrate, but Unknown seems even more mysterious and disconcerting.

Not just you...many dreamers out there.  But price just dropped 66% and merchant adoption has ground to a halt....more likely to implode, not explode.

If it physically exists on the Earth, then someone else can conceivably get it.   Better to PGP encrypt a regular wallet on multiple devices.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:48:30
It's already added.  I just bought some DRK on there.
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:18:18
Yes 10% inflation is a lot.  Maybe it will be better in the long run but right now it is a huge weight on the price and making all our bitcoin worth less and less every day at a rapid rate.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:21:32
Yes at $10 a pop, I'm sure you'll be a hundredaire eventualy.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:48:21
Nope,that's not the way it works.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:07:44
Yes I am more likely to donate than I am to click on an ad. I never do that.  And I have donated BTC to several sites where I liked the content.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:46:06
about the same here...although much of that was put in with bitcoinbuilder.com, so i take extra responsibility for it. It was a calculated risk that just didnt play out.
But Gox still stole our money if that cold storage is gone..no way around it.
@_date: 2014-12-21 05:54:33
It is absurd that hiding cash is now considered "money laundering".  If you bury cash in the ground, that is money laundering now and same with buying bitcoin with it.  Just absurd and perverts the original meaning of the term.  But the federal prosecutors are using same perverted definition.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:17:37
LOL...no you have lost that money when it drops.  Sure you may make money on your current position if it goes back up from here, but you already have suffered a loss if the current price is lower than where you bought.
And I don't mean to LOL you but it's just funny when people say this...about stocks or BTC or anything else.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:30:14
yes they did and some people are going to make a lot of money by buying GoxBTC right now and in the last few days.
@_date: 2014-12-27 07:44:44
no...it began last year and price is down 70%.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:21:19
well sounds like you use your computer for a medial player more than a productivity/business machine...that's fine but I need to be able to do more than listen to music and watch movies.
But yes I do need to setup a backup machine with Linux and try it out.

Some people are not capable of rational thought  And not saying this is necessarily true of who you responded to, but just saying it in general.  Nonsense is the best that many can do, especially with their investments, and bitcoin in particular.
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:25:34
yes I'm sure I have had well over 100 just myself and perhaps twice that.

Porn sites don't like bitcoin because they make most of their profits from recurring CC billing.

@_date: 2014-02-23 06:01:39
yes offline wallet is better..multibit or electrum, etc and backup and encrypt.

Buy a hooker or two.  You deserve it.
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:08:15
Gov't and the Power Elite have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin fail (or not grow any larger).  They didn't care with the internet and actually many billionaires were made and the rich got richer, so that's the main difference.
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:10:21
yes this news hasn't spread much yet, so this should give DRK a HUGE boost. I just loaded up on it myself.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:10:44
I have it on all the time and never occurred to me to turn it off.  It's totally fair and sites that don't like it, can come up with a better business model.
I never click on any of the website ads anyway, so it doesn't benefit the site to have me see them and doesn't hurt them to have them hidden from me.
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:43:11
you must be kidding...trust the f'ers at Coinbase to hold your money and give it back to you when you ask?
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:29:47
Let them work as a wage slave for the rest of their life because they aren't smart enough to see better ways to profit.  They aren't capable of any better.

Many people here are small timers who come on here and cry about losing .15 BTC.  They cannot conceive of $200K in BTC so it must be imaginary.

Yes amazing speed...by the year 2125, 20% of retailers may be accepting bitcoin.   If we can add four or five big retailers per year, like we did this year...well 2300 might be a more accurate year but amazing speed of adoption.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:09:21
yes but the new bitstamps of the world can just set up in somewhere besides NY and the USA.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:27:14
US gov't isn't going to allow US exchanges much longer.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:38:58
maybe in 75 years....not anytime soon though.
@_date: 2014-09-10 23:29:37
Bitcoin doesn't have billions of dollars to sink into marketing to dumb people who buy things because of pretty colors...also can't buy off politicians and engage in anticompetitive practices like Jobs/Cook/Apple does.  So of course it will do better than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:53:33
I still think it is mostly due to manipulation that pushes it lower, but of course no way to know for sure. But a lot of huge $ Power Elite types (and gov'ts) have vested interest in bitcoin not succeeding.  And dropping price slows adoption rates.

@_date: 2014-06-13 21:04:55
we understand it just fine.  We also understand that sitting there pontificating about the broken bitcoin protocol doesn't help anything in the short term.   If these miners are wrecking bitcoin, and it is hurting them, then is a dumbfuck move on their part.  That is the point.

they would know if you got caught or if you told them....or if you told someone else and they told them.  That is pretty much it.
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:00:32
I doubt they could sell off his confiscated assets before he was convicted of anything.  This is probably just an unfounded rumor.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:59:24
Have to assume he has this all backed up.   Paper wallet is not any more secure than cash...maybe a bit easier to conceal than a big stack of bills, but that's it.  But it can burn up or be stolen.  cold storage on encrypted flash drive backed up multiple times cannot be stolen, without cracking encryption which is extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2014-10-16 05:20:38
yes same reason a lot of very religious people hate atheists.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:21:47
Yes I agree this is not it. I tried to withdraw .5 BTC and 1 BTC and it didn't work (got stuck) and then did 3 BTC and it went through in about a minute.  Then I tried 4 BTC and it got stuck.  
@_date: 2014-06-18 05:39:17
damn I should have bought more of them. I did buy a $500 card while they had it up but should have bought another $1000.  It was just good savings. Sadly I shop there all the time, so would not have taken that long to use those up...and more money in the end. Oh well, maybe it will come back again.

They don't want to require all that information.  They are only doing it so they don't get f*cked hard by the gov't goons.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:02:39
For some reason I refuse to give them any money because they spurned bitcoin for so long.  But they did finally accept it so should get some credit I guess.  I suppose the millions of dollars they threw away for refusing to accept it for so long should be punishment enough.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:38:03
You could say the same about marijuana...it's just a natural plant...but guess what..it is in the suffocating regulatory box and tens of thousands of people are locked in a prison because they said "FUCK OFF".

way to follow along.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:26:33
nope it's easier to donate with bitcoin and if they don't make it easy to help the, they don't be surprised if less people helpl
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:06:41
That's great....so easy for retailers to do this and maybe they will realize it at some point.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:17:43
They certainly do some good things and some good (and great) people there, but too many bad ones and just core organizational problems.  Andreas leaving them says a lot.
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:57:49
How is it possible that it is taking them this long to add bitcoin when should have happened long ago.  I just don't get it.
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:18:40
Because it's invalid...the price doesn't drop 20% very often...and more often it goes up 20% in a day. So yes there is some volatility risk there, but it is reasonable and you more likely to come out on the upside of it than downside.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:45:22
"Just to update this thread, it seems that this discussion is mostly stale now. We (at MtGox) will implement this new hash index in our transactions database and start working with it (we will announce a maintenance as we will have to stop bitcoin deposits too during the database schema update) and will start providing this new hash when customers are withdrawing bitcoins, litecoins, or any other coin based on Bitcoin we may support in the future.
We will also provide an API that will allow our customers to use this hash to retrieve the transaction hash as seen in the blockchain once the transaction is confirmed, and will hope others (blockchain.info?) will index this value one day.
We also invite other exchanges and businesses which may need to keep track of bitcoins they send to use this same method, since dealing with multiple variations of the same thing wouldn't be very productive.
If nobody does it, we will also post some test vectors for regular (in=&gt;out) transactions in the near future."

Those laws aren't "futile" for the prison industry...and for politicians who benefit from them.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:15:16
Why would you want to end up with more bitcoins in the end by selling and then buying back more at a lower priice??   That means that you would have more money.   Don't you get that buy and hold is the best strategy.... because bitcoin will be $10,000 one day.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:50:46
looks good although I just pasted in one of my bitcoin addresses and it says invalid characters or something.  But when I put it in blockchain.info search, it works just fine.

no life is not about trial and error, whatever that means. it's about making planned rational decisions...not for you but for some of us.

There is a whole section on "Criminal activity"..that is plenty and don't need to throw in the kiddie porn reference just to make dumb people even angrier.  Of course the usual ones are terrorism, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, and kiddie porn.  You can demonize anything by saying it is involved in those activities and many people will automatically believe you.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:28:14
Good luck to this guy with ever hearing back from Conbase.  You charged my checking acct again for purchases I did three months ago, caused NSF fees, and guess what...all emails to customer service are not replied to.
Beware of CONbase !
(and btw, my friend had the same thing happen to them and there are stories like this all over bitcointalk...it's just the way you guys do business and gives bitcoin overall a bit of a black eye.)
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:17:39
Yes this, more than anything else, is what makes me question Bitcoin's future and also makes me nervous about having so much of my funds invested in it.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:54:17
police kill people all the time when it is justified.  And your claimed omniscience is laughable.   He wasn't charged with murder for hire, because he probably didn't do it.

@_date: 2014-02-17 01:33:15
It's fine with me if they do this as long as I can get my BTC out at some point now.   I mean it's not cool but I would rather they do this than just declare bankruptcy and I lose my BTC immediately.

A lot of the bitcoin community has fallen right into LE's hands with this one.  They tried to manipulate the simple minded into being against Ulbricht with the murder for hire angle and of course some low IQ individuals fall right into line.

One of my hobbies is spending quality time with hoes, and sometimes I mention bitcoin to themand I don't think even one of them has heard of it.  Or maybe one did, but they didn't know anything about it.

"I don't see how China maybe banning bitcoin changes anything long term"
Surely you jest...not sure what you mean by "long term".  Yes maybe it won't matter in 100 years but they just made it so it's much more difficult, if not impossible for 1.35 billion people to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:34:52

@_date: 2014-03-24 05:48:40
Yeah when I heard everyone say that on Jan 1, I figured it was a really bad sign because the crowd is usually wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:31:22
Yes a bit too long winded...but they sound like too lazy to accept BTC right now.
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:37:15
Yes and no one suggested that they "support" bitcoin.  We are suggesting that they take bitcoin donations...that they make it possible for people to give them free money.
But hey they don't want it, so it will stay in my wallet...no big deal. I'll just give it to someone else just as deserving.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:59:05
Such bullsh*t.  So when people withdraw money from Bank of America and spend it on drugs or kiddie porn or whatever else, do they seize funds from BoA?  Of course not....the sad thing is that dumb people believe all this and there are a LOT of dumb people out there.
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:50:32
Yes of course murder is justified when it is in self defense.  "Murder" is just a legal term anyway.

yeah just make something up.  I do that all the time.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:33:37
Tell that to the people with the guns and tanks who make the rules.

There are few people as invested in the "status quo" as Buffet and the other billionaires out there.  
And of course analogy with checks is a poor one because you can print checks indefinitely...no scarcity there...just like with fiat, of course.
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:42:21
In Florida, the max amount is $300.  So you are saying, as long as you aren't selling over $300 of Bitcoin, you should be fine...not much consolation.
@_date: 2014-08-10 03:17:59
yes probably but a whole lot are lost too. I've lost a few myself and I have been pretty careful...just a lot of flaws in many bitcoin sites and other thing that can go wrong.

You mean like Sony, Apple, Intel and every other major company?
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:46:03
Banks love drug dealers and crooks (and yes terrorists), as long as they don't get in trouble for dealing with them.  And even when they do get caught, it is like 3% sales tax when they get fined.  Of course no one in the banks go to jail for laundering money.

There is NO excuse the way he has behaved and dealt with this entire ordeal.  Even if had a gun to his head, he could have posted better updates on Gox.com, etc.

You can have them pay with Western Union or Moneygram.  The fees are high for them, but not your problem.  
Have them use a secret question and then you don't have to show your ID.  There may be limits on the amounts you can receive and don't want to get shut down for no reason.
But if you go pick up the cash and have it your hand and then send the bitcoin, obviously nothing can get reversed.

Most wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone...at least as far as I remember.  So just go in there and delete that paragraph if you don't like it.  Someone will probably add it back but just delete it again. Sometimes they lock the articles for editing though.

If you are paying with Bitcoin, they won't know what market you are in.   Just use VPN and say you are from Europe and use bitcoin and play...and I'm sure they will encourage this, even if not openly and enthusiastically.

No it's fake.  That's why if you google it,  you will see all the fake articles and websites about it, including ESPN.

Way to to be a simpleton and break it down into black and white.  It's not a question of gov't vs non-gov't genius.  The issue is not having evil people in the gov't who do evil things.  Some of us would prefer that.  You can be in favor of the opposite if you like, but don't introduce a useless straw man to the discussion.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:27:33
Yes in 5 years, at this rate, BTC will have .000000001% of the market.  And think where it could be in 10 years !!

"real" people are losers then.

Progress has not been huge...still very few big retailers accept BTC.  And no reason for them to when hardly anyone (except us) uses it.

@_date: 2014-04-14 04:34:20
That doesn't work because the bitcion protocol and confirmations are so f'ing slow.  It can take an hour to transfer funds into an exchange and when the market is moving fast, that is an eternity and can cost you a LOT of profits.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:36:24
Again, if you are a person in NY, arrested and imprisoned for selling $5 of bitcoin to a friend without all the paperwork, that you have to keep for 10 years...then what you say isn't going to help them that much.

I've had terrible experiences with Coinbase, as have many of my friends.  They will withdrawl money from your bank account repeatedly for one BTC buy...even months later.  They did that to me and caused overdraft charges, etc.
And if you get too good of a price for BTC, they will just cancel your order right before you receive it.  They are crooks.

yes when BTC triples from $25 to $75 maybe.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:27:28
a lot of people are scared to go meet a stranger to do a cash transaction.  And don't call them "wrong" to feel this way...doesn't matter.  That's the reality and bitcoin is difficult to buy.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:46:19
Your mind doesn't physically exist either.  It is a function of your brain, which does exist.  
A quick google search says virtual: very close to being something without actually being it
So clearly not a great message to send about bitcoin...very close to being a currency but not quite.
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:46:04
Yes it is relatively safe. I have done quite a few transactions on there with no issues. I suggest going on the LBC forums and spending some time reading.  Other sellers will post their concerns and scams that are out there, etc.  But there is greater risk with selling with Paypal and some other methods.  Bank deposit is more reliable and if you get payment with Moneygram, then that is very safe because you have cash in hand before you send the BTC.   
I had two buyers try to scam me on there, but they were brand new, with no feedback and LBC ruled in my favor, so didn't lose anything...with the coins in escrow.
And meeting in person for cash is probably the best solution, but of course meet in s safe location, etc.
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:30:11

@_date: 2014-04-11 09:19:07
That's fine...not sure where people get their "magic" 10% number from.  Many people risked 30% or 50% on bitcoin and they are millionaires now.  It is risk and reward and don't let anyone else tell you how to figure out that equation for yourself.

That is really bad advice.  You can't set a target price at some point in the future.  The risk/reward equation is fluid and always changing.  Sell when you think the price is going down and buy when you think it is going up..that's it.

Many people are in this not only to support bitcoin but also to grow their wealth.  So just because you didn't feel like selling at 1150 and buying back at 350, doesn't mean that other people didn't want to do that...and that they don't enjoy seeing their net worth decrease.
@_date: 2014-07-18 08:02:48
Yes...this.  Regs like in NY will probably spread to other states, before long.  The bankers and other special interests just have too much at stake and can pay the politicians to enact laws like this and slow Bitcoin down, and effectively kill it for many people who would otherwise use it.

Yes Dogecoin seems to be for children who like to play and bitcoin is for adults who take their financial freedom and prosperity more seriously.  Nothing wrong with either approach, but that's the way it is.
But all of the alt coins are ultimately good for bitcoin because people bail out of the alts and almost always convert those funds to BTC.
Anyway only advice is to understand how private keys work and be sure you have those backed up before you send any funds to any wallet not on an exchange.  I didn't do that with blockchain.info wallet and their website glitch cost me 8 BTC.   
Anyway be prepared to watch BTC go up in price while DOGE drops further into relative obscurity.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:41:21
yes having paper wallet is no better than having cash...it can be stolen or seized.
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:11:19


Huh?   How do you figure that...if you have your money in bitcoin and do not give them your private key, then they aren't going to get the funds.  This is in contrast to any financial accts, which can easily be seized, as well as cash that can be seized.  Of course you can bury your cash deep in the woods somewhere, but still more vulnerable than bitcoin that is protected by private key that is in your possession and your possession alone.
The Silk Road bust is an example of someone who either willingly gave up their private key or did not protect it (which is unlikely).

Just don't keep your BTC on an exchange and you wouldn't have any of these problems.  The only risk would be the time between when your funds hit the exchange to when you buy BTC and get it out.

@_date: 2014-07-22 07:54:37
You don't hold your bitcoins, so not like they could burn up.  You only hold the private key to access them.  That is like losing the key to your safe deposit box in a fire and then wanting the insurance to cover what inside the safe deposit box, that is elsewhere.  They aren't going to do it.

Blockchain can screw up and steal your coins too.  I lost $5K worth of BTC on there several months ago.

If one in the world is using bitcoin successfully, then technically it is not a "failure"...but just saying that it's growth has stalled and will be very slow.  Maybe it will gain widespead acceptance in the year 2080 but I don't think that's what most here were going for and were betting was going to happen.
I still love BTC and not saying it is inherently flawed but just that the Power Elite is not going to allow it to succeed.
First they ignore you
Then they ridicule you
Then they fight you.

Nope it's not money laundering and not even close to the basic definition.  Of course it could be called that under some vague law, but that's beside the point of what you said.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:18:08
yes it is better to buy and hold.  Why sell and then buy back 3x as many bitcoins later on.  It's better to watch your holdings dwindle in value over many months.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:27:57
lol...how did this get 34 upvotes?
yes of course for every seller, there's a buyer...at lower and lower prices.
Yes someone could dump 10,000 BTC on the market..and there would be buyers for it and the price would tank.
You guys are clueless...no wonder you are losing all your money.
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:57:14
Why would they bother doing that?   It sounds like more accounting and more paperwork and not like anyone is saving money on credit card fees in this case.  
The IRS has made laws that discourage this type of activity.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:35:36
The point is that it's free to send bitcoins from one person to another, over international borders.   Eventually, you won't need to convert them back and forth. And even now, you don't necessarily have to.  Some people are paid in bitcoin and they send it to people overseas who want to hold the bitcoin or spend the bitcoin...no conversation to fiat is necessary for either party.
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:38:29
same for gold that  took a big tumble...but yes bitcoin is a lot worse

If the customer is paying for a tip with a credit card, they are paying that money to the server.  So it does make sense for the server to pay the 3% of the tip amount to be able to accept the credit card funded tip.

Yeah why don't you just start your own bitcoin exchange and also buy out Google and Amazon and then you can do even more for BTC...very practical suggestion.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:23:21
yes exactly...the bitcoin sycophants on here won't accept that fact.
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:03:33
Yes of course...it's all about getting the dumb people to believe anything bad you say about someone and public officials are pros at this.
The latest one was the US Marshals saying that they are selling the seized bitcoin in a way to cause minimal disruption to Bitcoin market.  Of course the polar opposite is the obvious truth but lots of dumb people take the statement at face value.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:53:17
Ok so why take risk of them deciding to commit "corporate suicide" when it will bring down all of bitcoin? 
Maybe Russian mobster has gun to head of Ghash.io CEO or maybe he just has brain damage and does something crazy.
It will wreak havoc and not sure why so many people have their head in the sand about it.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:31:46
it's technically good for bitcoin but the amounts are so small, that it's not very significant.  And amounts won't grow much because mfers don't want to get busted and thrown into russian prison.
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:47:37
No one I've ever met does this and I've done a couple hundred trades from LBC at least.  No one is going to go to that trouble even if you think they "should' do it.
Or maybe you can find someone, but going to kill your sales.  And yes you have less chance of being robbed but extremely slim chance anyway.  And who are you going to trust to administer the escrow for you....again, it's just not practical.

I would say he's a dishonest businessman who tried to cheat one of his customers...probably incompetent on top of that.
But he probably just doomed his business because bitcoin community is fairly close knit and every one of his potential customers in the future will be aware of this..or at least 95% of them.   And they will NOT buy his product.

Blockchain.info sometimes just arbitrarily decides not to add a fee, even though you have it set to do so.  This just happens to everyone and maybe they will get around to fixing their website someday.

I don't know but I recently bailed on multibit for losing track of my BTC too often.  I could restore them into Blockchain.info using private key import but just worrisome that multibit loses the coins as well as the transaction and resetting the blockchain in the program doesn't fix it...serious bugs there.

@_date: 2014-12-02 18:12:05
Yes I was thinking the same thing.  They can ban ChangeTip and make their own tipping service and have it funded by credit cards and not have anything to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:38:15
yes if you can't store money safely in a bank, then perhaps store some in bitcoin.  Of course there is the risk of the price dropping, but also can go up. It is just a store of value like gold or silver and you can also use it as currency sometimes.

You must be kidding...trying to spin this into some sort of positive for bitcoin.  Short-term and long-term, it is terrible news.  
And localbitcoins is not a "centralized" market to a large extent.  Buyers and sellers find each other on there and then do transactions off the site the majority of the time.
Seems like many people here are desperate at this point as the price drops and drop and drops.  But at least try to keep it real, at least a little.

@_date: 2014-12-12 09:58:54

@_date: 2014-06-12 18:51:03
Ok so we looked at the root cause and we all agree it is a flaw/weak point in the bitcoin protocol. 
So now that we've done that, we still have to deal with risk of 51% attack which involves trying to get the miners not to be idiots and bring down the entire bitcoin world.  That is the reality of the situation.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:33:10

In the long run, yes....but in the short run, you have people who have been hoarding BTC start to spend it on DISH and other things and that BTC suddenly coming into the market to be sold puts downwards pressure on the price.

@_date: 2014-03-29 16:56:33
every large pullback from a high doesn't mean the high was a "bubble".  Fundamentals pushed BTC down more than technicals lately.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:34:25
doesn't matter...they aren't being charged with that. Please pay attention and save us all some time.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:53:16
Yea I can see trying to manage your risk but I don't know that LTC is a great alternative. 
You know that if BTC gets taken down, it will take LTC with it too....and all the other alt coins.  Prices of all will tank because they are tied to BTC.

@_date: 2014-07-09 16:24:06
The entire point is that a whole lot of people out there are "lazy" as you put it..or maybe bitcoin just isn't that important to them.  So they don't jump through hoops to buy BTC and slows adoption rates.
Good job with missing the entire point of the article and thread.
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:26:23
No...when the price was rocketing upwards, people had an idea it was rocketing upwards..and over the past few months during downtrend, seemed likely downtrend would continue.  Everyone is not as equally as clueless as you are, ever step of the way.

"Weak" hands were Smart hands this year.  Anyone who sold earlier in the year was smarter than anyone who held...plain and simple.
And I'm largely in that group (although buying and selling often), so not saying I'm so smart either.  But the smart people sold at 800 and bought back twice as many BTC at 400 (or 300)
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:30:05
I would think so.  LBC seems like the way to go for them.
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:26:45
I love this...grat idea.
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:00:19
Nope you are a simpleton yourself to try to break it down like that.  The lack of consumer adoption is what is causing bitcoin not to grow.  I wouldn't say it is "dying" but almost stillborn at this point.  Well that's an exaggeration but it's stuck as a baby in the crib and the gov't and Power Elite are trying to smother it and will probably be mostly successful.
And I didn't say the price is "low".  I said it is falling...that is the problem.  If it stabilzed here for the next years, would be much better for everyone than it dropping more and more and more and discouraging new investment.  The miners just keep on minting BTC and dumping and price keeps dropping.

Keep hope alive !  I see that the price of GoxBTC on bitcoinbuilder.com more than doubled in the last few hours, and I bet this thread is part of it.
But some people just made 100% return in about 5 hours if they bought at the low and sold back their GoxBTC now for regular BTC.  I like that site and love volatility of any kind in these markets...create nice opportunities for profit.
But besides this, would be great if Gox returned at least some of the bitcoin they owe for all the people in the community who have a lot on there and who are genuinely hurting...stay strong..

yes they'll still be saying it
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:22:58
That's why every time a major retailer announces they are taking bitcoin, the price drops hard over the following days..worked with Expedia, NewEgg, etc...not theory but reality.
But of course long-term, it is still bullish for bitcoin.

You can already rub it in.  They are just bitter because they sat on the sidelines and you made all the bitcoin proits and they didn't.

Yes great way to save and store your wealth when you lose 70% in a year due to the depreciation of BTC.  
Maybe bitcoin will be less volatile in 10 years, but right now it is about the worst store of value there is.   
And if it triples tomorrow, it's still a terrible store of value...you need relativel stability.  At least gold takes years to lose 10 or 15% in most cases.
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:43:23
nope, just a realist, unlike yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:52:49
I kept BTC on there too.  You have to do the math and realize that they were making MILLIONS of $$$s in commissions and also people were getting their fiat fairly quickly in Euros and Yen. It was banking issues that delayed some of the US withdrawl problems.
NO ONE thought they had lost all their cold storage, which is why we are all here and lost our BTC.  That was basically unforseeable, or at least super small probability.

@_date: 2014-03-06 00:40:28
Ok so kind of cool but Bitcoin needs a better mascot.  We need a cuddly bear or other anthropomorphized animal.  A huge bitcoin is difficult to relate to.  And cute animal mascots are better for children and will make them more excited about bitcoin.
I guess the obvious would be Satoshi the bear or the lion or whatever.  But I like alliteration so something like "Bobo the Bitcoin Bear" or "Benjamin the Bitcoin Beagle"...something like that.
However we can do better than this mascot and I encourage others to work in this direction.

@_date: 2014-05-26 11:03:26
Well you are safer buying BTC with Paypal than selling it that way.

I left a comment/question on the above page:
If you want to take bitcoin donations, that doesn't mean you have to receive bitcoin.  Coinbase and Bitpay will process it for free and you just end up with US$.  So your statement above:  [quoted but removed here]   makes absolutely zero sense.

Add me to the list...lost about $5K on blockchain.info wallet a few months ago because their site didn't "sync" to my computer properly.   I made a new address and even sent a test amount to it and it showed up in the wallet.  So i sent the rest and when I logged back in, the address was gone and the BTC was gone, and the private key wasn't accessible.   Customer support said they couldn't do anything about it, and I am no longer a fan of blockchain.info like I used to be.  
So not a "theft", per se, but a glitch in their website that can steal your money.

Voted down.  Yes it is an ideal solution if Bitcoin didn't have this flaw and would be great, if ideally, it was fixed in the future.
But the REALITY right now is that CEX.IO having over 50% of the hash rate is terrible for bitcoin and for most of us here.
If you don't care, more power to you, but don't act like the rest of us should not.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:18:45
Yes I had terrible experiences with them did, as did many of my friends.  They should be called CONbase.  They are crooked and will cancel your buys after they have your money for days, if the BTC price has gone up a good amount.  Plus yes they will pull extra money out of your bank account from a trade from months ago.  
These are not rare isolated incidents.  You have been warned.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:57:40
if it was up 35% on the news, then maybe, but it is just up fractionally and if you take the time to look at the chart, it is not an unusual move.

@_date: 2014-06-13 03:40:33
I never said it was the "majority"....why does that matter anyway?  A significant minority is better than nothing.   So your argument is if you can't reach the majority of miners, just give up and keep your mouth shut. I disagree.

I made the same mistake and one of the reasons, I stopped using multibit.  It saves the last address you send to for some reason and just has other bugs as well.
But I accidentally sent $1800 worth of BTC to this dude who I knew wouldn't give it back, and of course he didn't.
I think I did "double check" but apparently not very well. I was sleep deprived too and very bad things can happen when you are operating in those conditinos.

@_date: 2014-06-01 12:03:19
Yes I am shorting some of these pops too much but the rise is relenteless.  I'm sacrificing some profits I guess, but still hoping to capitalize on a pullback.   But I realize I am swimming upstream at the moment.
But 450 to 650 in about 12 days is a huge gain and one would think there would likely be a correction at some point...maybe.
Although I suppose this is the correction from 1200 to 350.   Anyway still short a bit to hedge my long holdings.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:28:12
It depends on how respectful they were to start the conversation.  It could ahve been "Sell at $1200 you idiot.  And you idiot, why did you hold from $1200 to $440.
Ok maybe they had a point with the 2nd one.  Not sure why you would take that kind of loss, but that is the buy and hold religion for you.  I'd rather sell at 1100 and buy back at 500 or so, but that's just me.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:01:53
Ok thanks...that is pretty much my understanding although I didn't think about the BTC getting lost and offsetting some of the ones created.  Anyway I guess it will be inflationary for a decade or two until the block reward is much lower than it is now.  But doesn't sound like mining will cease until early next century, and by that time of course bitcoin will likely be long replaced by something else (if that doesn't already happen in the next few years).

yes of course you should hold them if they are still going down.  Why would you sell them now and buy even more bitcoins back when they are lower?   You would end up with more bitcoins in the end and you sure don't want that.

@_date: 2014-07-08 10:20:03
Don't forget all the time you spend doing accounting for the IRS....calculating your cost basis and then the value per BTC of what you spend...and saving all that somewhere.
Using bitcoin is more complicated and time consuming than credit card or cash or anything else.  I love BTC but that is keeping it real.
The IRS nonsense may be what keeps bitcoin from really taking off..just wait for some high profile prosecutions and it will limit growth considerably...and of course that's their plan and it will most likely work.

accounting is easy and they don't "have" to give tax receipts.  That could be a condition of donating and the sender would have the blockchain as a "receipt" anyway.

Thanks you.  I was thinking about making a BOYCOTT CEX-IO thread and hopefully reposting it periodically.  
We (the bitcoin community) needs to take the thread they pose much more seriously.  They can conceivably wreck the currency and cause many of us to have huge financial losses.
It is not a game and they are f'ing with bitcoin and we need to boycott them PERMANENTLY and encourage others to do the same.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:00:01
its for their own good, not just "greater good". That doesn't need to be part of the equation until you unnecessarily interject it in there. That's the point that you incredibly miss.
And a lot of miners have sacrificed a little to help ensure their long-term profitability and survival.  Sorry your lazy all or nothing thinking just tries to confuse the point.
The smart miners are going elsewhere to lower the probability of ruining their business permanently.

I have sold some bitcoin and yes "don't ask, don't tell" is best.  If you trade someone some dollars for a car, do you ask them what they are going to do with the money?  No of course not.  But if someone offers up that kind of info I would get out of there and you played it well.

"    Recently, a new digital currency attempted to emerge, known as

          Bitcoin and implied a connection to rapper Kanye West via a  
          cartoon picture of Kanye West as the currency's logo.  A lawsuit  
          filed in a Manhattan federal court sought to stop COINYE on the  
          grounds that it used the rapper's image to cash in on his  
          popularity without his consent, damaging his reputation and  
          confusing consumers about the source of the cryptocurrency.F
Facing legal action, creators of COINY have ended the project 
and COINYE is now Lost in the World, but may have bee nothing more than a Dark Fantasy.  "

No it's usually when the price has gone up since your buy and they would rather keep the bitcoin than give it to you (even though they took the money from you for it 3 or 4 days prior).
Of course they won't be honest and say that so they will say the transaction is "suddenly" suspicious...again 3 or 4 days after they took your money.

2014 has been a massive FAIL for bitcoin.  I don't know how someone could try to spin it as anything else.
Gox, China, and price tanking.  It's been terrible and no reason to think anything will change anytime soon.
I love bitcoin and it has great potential but it's going nowhere slowly lately.
If the price would just find a bottom, I think most of us would be much better off.  It doesn't have to take over the world to be useful for us and maybe 99% of the rest of the world just won't ever "get it".

@_date: 2014-12-31 15:26:44
yeah this isn't too complicated.  Bitcoin will catch on with the masses any day now.
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:35:03
it's not about a "good cause".  It's about acting in your own economic self interest.  if there are double spend attacks and bitcoin is irreparably harmed, the most of these CEX-io customers are going to be losing money, which is not their goal
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:51:13
Yes a lot of people in here are totally delusional and have no idea how markets work.  I'm glad these folks are on the other side of many of my BTC daytrades.

I doubt STEVERODGERS made a stupid comment like that.  Yes half of the population has below avg intelligence but got to think that most bitcoiners have above avg IQ, so SR is probably in that group and most likely did not make an equivalent stupid comment.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:18:24
there was a thread on here about this one chick who had tramp stamp like that and it did work.  No way to tell if it was permanent or temporary tattoo but very cool.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:48:31
They are trying to promote Google Wallet not bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:33:47
I tried two withdrawls last night of about 1 BTC each and they both didn't' work, yet the BTC was deducted from my account. I tried another one this morning with 3 BTC and it went through quickly and successfully.
So going to keep trying although not sure if i can do anything about the ones that are "stuck".  But at least some are going through, which at least suggests they aren't out of BTC totally.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:23:01
not really jumped..just bounced off the recent new lows...still down down down over last few years.  Look at the chart.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:53:48
Paper wallet is the same as cold storage.  And doesn't have to be paper...can also store it on computer (preferably encrypted).
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:10:51
as long as the wallet file is encrypted, that sounds like a sound strategy.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:51:23
Yeah it's fine to take the money of "rich Russians"...great argument and shows where you are coming from.
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:48:40
You can make paper wallets and encrypt screen caps of them and then use an app like Mycelium to draw monies from them as necessary.   You can use multiple address and don't put all the funds in one wallet or address.   But yes the phone is the weak link there and also you have to trust Mycelium too to some degree.
@_date: 2014-07-11 11:58:21
Price is moving up..I wonder how much this news has to do with it.
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:57:10
seems like less risks with bitfinex and btce rather than bitstamp...just different kinds of risks.

@_date: 2014-12-10 22:02:17
yes i was surprised to see them being so defensive and condescending in the comments section of a couple of their articles.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:12:50
yes you don't understand arbitrage very well and what is necessary for it.
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:55:05
Yes I love how the bears just discount China and Gox, which is what really crashed the price and not their magical "bubble".
And I agree it was overbought at 1200 and due for a pullback/correction, but it wasn't necessarily a bubble.

Gox has $5K of my BTC and I can't get it out. I have no idea how things will go with BTC-e, but I transferred my funds out of there to be extra safe.  The transfers just fine and only took a few minutes.

If BTC pops upwards this much on this kind of news, just think what it will do when USA Wall Street ETF gets approved...maybe $100 spike at that time.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:37:00
Yes exactly...they are going to do it eventaully anyway so why not just go ahead.  But the leadership there doesn't seem to feel like it is a priority and that is their decision.  And I respect that decision and they can respect my decision not to donate any money to them.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:13:43
It took them about 6 weeks to send me 1 ounce.  I was just glad to get it at that point and won't be using them again of course.

Yes of course...that's why people who believe that aren't exactly the best traders/investors around.  All they know is buy and hold which works sometimes if they get lucky but not a smart strategy overall.

"It also happens to be the best solution".
Wow...what a very small minded view.  You really don't think there could possibly be anything better.
Anyway credit cards are better for some types of purchases and bitcoin is better for others. I know this idea is offensive to anyone who can only see in black and white, but sorry, it's the reality.

It's not guaranteed that the sun will come up tomorrow.  It's all about probabilities.

wrong....how do you think "most people" are going to find this out?  
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:08:06
How is 7 cents considered an "absurdly high" fee?  
Compare Bitcoin fee to credit card fee and there is a big difference.  CC fee is a lot higher than 7 cents.  And yes you don't pay it directly as a buyer but it is priced in to whatever you are buying.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:19:45
You are only encouraging future anti-bitcoin troll-like behavior by giving this loser so much attention (and $).
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:37:21
They are claiming the entire bitcoin protocol is flawed..that is pretty bad..
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:31:30
They left out the part where you have to get fingerprinted and provide a sample of your DNA to register to use the machine.
Or maybe that is just in the USA.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:22:47
Yes so true...people hear one or two isolated bits of information and then they are sure 100% that they know EXACTLY what is going on.  
"No critical thinking" is correct because they aren't capable of that. Some are just lazy but most are just doing the best they can with limited functioning of their brains.
Never forget that half the people out there have below average intelligence...that explains a lot.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:10:52
Yes that's the point...it is more volatile than gold or stocks, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:17:38
Very cool...I think Mt Gox debacle (and resulting negative press) really hurt BTC adoption but maybe it is still creeping along and will ramp up rapidly at some point.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:19:40
yes wgas for sure.  correcting every little typo is a waste of time.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:55:54
The point is not to support a worthy cause..it is to get good press and advertising for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:50:05
Great so if your dollars were safe, then that's all that matters and never mind everyone else who lost collectively billions from that and other crises.
You are definitely not the type of person who needs to use bitcoin...you probably will eventually, but try to avoid it as long as possible.
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:09:10
It sounds like this is just for FIAT withdrawl and not BTC withdrawl.  In that case, they could be doing aggressive KYC just to protect their banking partners and ENSURE THAT YOU CAN WITHDRAW YOUR FIAT IN THE FUTURE.  
But still this is a pain in the ass and Bitfinex will be  exchange shortly.
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:22:47
You aren't taking a big risk unless bitcoin takes a catastrophic drop overnight.  If that doesn't happen, just cut your loss at 5 or 10% and no big deal. 
The fact that others in here just see it as "all or nothing" says a lot about why they don't have 100 BTC themselves.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:30:17
and we always will because basic human nature does not change.  It will be that way until the singularity or until humanity is extinct (which would be the best thing for 99.9% of the other residents of this planet)

I didn't say "can" they.  I said "do" they...pay attention and what % of the time do you think said cash is seized?
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:45:59
except for extra paperwork, the confusion for customers, and the fact that less than 1% of your customers will even use it anytime soon.
And of course I'm pro bitcoin adoption, but just saying it is not a slam dunk like Mr Dell suggests it is.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:39:38
of course dumbfuck simpletons will say you should go to jail if you "break the law".  And remember there were laws against gay people having sex and women voting and blacks sitting in the front of the bus.

Coinbase makes a lot of bad decisions.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:49:02
You lost me when you started bashing anyone who had money in Gox....broken record and overly simplistic.
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:08:57
They were talking about this on bitcointalk and someone made the good point that BTC is not good for porn because most of those sites make money on CC subscriptions that automatically renew (or they just charge your card repeatedly and hope you don't notice).
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:04:10
Yes you are the only one because this is weeks old news and also they weren't charged related to what the money would be used for..the credit card part of it.  That was just an way to confuse people who are easily confused.
@_date: 2015-05-29 01:17:26
I lost $5K in BTC on their site (due to an admitted flaw with their site) and they never offerred to refund me.  I wrote about it extensively here too.
But glad to hear they did something right in your case.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:18:40
Yeah they carry on dancing and they get imprisoned or at least fined a few year's salary...great analogy.
@_date: 2014-12-03 06:48:50
I lost quite a bit of BTC on blockchain.info wallet because of glitch with the website (not a security breach), and apparently many other people have had similar problems so yes I agree they are overrated and should not be promoted so heavily.
@_date: 2014-12-23 09:18:07
yeah right the banks should stop shunning bitcoin, and instead do something that will only cost them power and profits...makes sense.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:21:58
Coinbase is horrible.  They have scammed me and my friends out of several different bitcoin purchases.  They say your bitcoin will arrive in 6 days...they take the money out of your acct and then if the Bitcoin price/value goes down during that time, you are screwed.
If the price goes, up, then Coinbase will cancel the transaction 10 minutes before they are supposed to deliver the bitcoin to you.  They are crooks and theives and just google it and you will see they have done this to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
@_date: 2014-11-27 21:18:23
change it yourself...anyone can.
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:48:34
you didn't figure out how to land on the moon...nor did I.  Because we are stupid. Sure there is a tiny percentage of less stupid and even kind of smart people but they are the tiny minority.

lol...yes good one.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:12:48
I tried to transfer another 4 BTC out and they disappeared like my earlier ones.  So just one one of four withdraws successful and that was for 3 BTC.  The other ones were for .5, 1, and 4 and all seem to have failed, yet the BTC was decducted from my Gox acct.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:28:18
Ummm..isn't Florida the state where if you sell more than $300 of bitcoin in a day to someone, they can arrest you and throw you in jail?
Or wait...not they CAN arrest you...they WILL arrest you.  Those two sellers on Localbitcoins got arrested for selling over the minimum amount of BTC....they were thrown in jail, their freedom stripped away...for selling bitcoin. 
And please no comments about other aspects of the case, meant to confuse the easily confused...what were they charged with?    
They were charged with selling over $300 of bitcoin....Ok, so you will soon be able to be arrested in NY for selling $3 worth, but Florida is just about the 2nd worst state to sell bitcoin in at this point.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:21:46

Hang in there, my friend. I lost all my money in the stock market about 10 years ago and was so depressed...it took me years to recover mentally from that but it shouldn't have taken so long.  But I have done so well with bitcoin so there is always hope and just try to put one foot in front of the other.
And if you have your health you have EVERYTHING ( well with food and shelter, that is).  That is so true and you should be thankful for that, assuming you have it.

Bitcoin is all over the implications.  If you don't see that, you are surely lost.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:32:39
Bitcoin enthusiasts are mostly "passionate", not "fanatical".
And you don't get that there didn't used to be hardly any bitcoin news, so people got in the habit of posting every article. Maybe it isn't as necessary now, but probably a holdover habit and still interesting.
Anyway you make some reasonable points and you are off the mark with some of them, but thanks for taking the time to post.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:46:02
That's because BTC protocol has some tragic flaws and we are trying to do damage control, and prevent total meltdown.
If "begging" people do what is best for them is what is needed, that's what we will do.
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:03:14
The coming Wall Street "stampede" is a common BTC holder's fantasy.  Because I hear it said so much, got to think it probably won't happen.
Anyway there isn't enough liquidity for most big wall street players.  Maybe at some point in the distant future if there is an exchange that provides that (and a whole lot of people to supply that volume) then maybe it will happen but doubt it before then.

Wow, low IQ people sure have short memories.  The fact that you don't even mention China makes it obvious you are clueless.
That willy bot was a minor factor.  I know it's difficult for you to grasp but Mt Gox did not buy on the Chinese exchanges and those are the ones that led the market in the big runup.  
I was sitting here watching it at the time, along with others here who don't have horribly poor memories.
No wonder so many of you lose all your "investments" with bitcoin...a fool and his money are soon parted.

Fuck coinbase...I mean conbase.  They have been ripoff mfers since the start.  They screwed me out of money on numerous occasions, as well as friends and a quick google search can pull up their scams.
They are crooks...place your buy order and they take your money...then bitcoin goes up and five days later, they tell you they are canceling your order, 5 minutes before bitcoin is due to be delivered to you.   They did this to me and friends and a lot of people...and still probably steal from their customers.
They are evil and in the same category as Gox in my mind...hope they burn.  Hope the gov't fucks them up the ass HARD at some point.

Bitstamp has been slow with withdrawls from hot wallet off and on for last 18 months at least. This is nothing new.
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:17:58
this why consumer adoption has slowed to a halt and is probably declining lately....too difficult to protect your money.

I am single and bang about 50 different women a year..and have female friends to hang out with.  And no drama of annoying wife/gf.  Sure there are good companions out there too, but why do the majority get divorced if it's so great?   
And got to think avg Bitcoiners IQ is significantly higher than that of general population.   I'm not saying we are "smart" in all things, but saying our IQ is higher..most people can't wrap their head around bitcoin or even do basic math.

@_date: 2015-01-09 15:55:24
Bitstamp has been a lazy exchange for a long time now.  Bitfinex constantly improves their site and interface and Bitstamp does nothing.  Plus they require all your personal info and a sample of your DNA to even withdraw your money.   
it is bad for bitcoin that they got robbed, but no sadness over it here.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:43:28
 You got lucky..they usually cancel the transfer if the price went up.  About 10 minutes before your bitcoin is supposed to be delivered.
Conbase are crooks...this has happened to me and many other people.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:32:16
Ok and 99% of people are sheep...so what's your point.
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:02:13
yep...it's becoming obvious even to long term holders...who will most likely sell eventually as the price drops further.
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:16:50
umm...yeah, sounds like a superb business model.
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:04:44
anything on amazon.com, etc
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:19:41
You at least deserve a free HJ for that.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:27:04
you don't have to pick the top...the smart money sells just down from the top.
The dumb money watches their investment drop 80%.  That is never justified.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:19:26
 yes no kidding...talk about thrill of victory and agony of defeat.  BTC has aged me a decade or so and given me lots of extra gray hair for sure.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:06:32
Yes bitcoin lowers the bar every day...sad but true.
And I like BTC, but starting to realize what a clusterfuck it is, on so many levels.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:04:05
lol....Shady because you would rather give your DNA to Bitstamp than trade with a company that has been totally trustworthy and hasn't had any hacks or shenanigans...ok good for you, but some of us feel otherwise.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:10:37
they have had problems with withdrawls off and on for 18 months...that's part of why I bailed on them long ago.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:04:04
Yes when you lose 80% of your money in a year, better to think of Bitcoin as a "revolution" than an investment....at least then you may not jump off that bridge.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:49:28
Customers won't put up with that....and a business without customers is not much of a business.  You may prefer that but most everyone else does not.

@_date: 2015-01-09 12:51:18
Bad reporting...they state that Mt Gox lost all their BTC when it was "hacked" when everyone knows it was probably Karpeles who stole the money.  If anything, it isn't accepted fact of a hack.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:59:06
no the writing is on the wall that bitcoin is failing and the smart money is short.   That is why short interest is high.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:20:49
No....timing the market is a game for the non-fool.  But yes a lot of fools do it and lose money.  The elite smart traders consistently make profits though by timing the market...just because you (and I) can't do it, doesn't mean it can't be done by better minds than ours.
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:24:46
yeah bitcoin is really going to succeed with the masses when it's this complicated to secure your BTC.
And I love how if you actually spend from your wallet, then you dramatically increase the chances your BTC can be stolen..great for consumer adoption.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:15:29
it's call "propaganda" not "journalism"
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:48:00

@_date: 2014-06-13 03:43:05
Ok that sounds very idealistic, but most of us are not able to offer a better cloud hashing market alternative.  And also this alternative does not exist now, so in the meantime, it is best for bitcoin and for most of us to boycott CEX.io.
It is very simple, and all your theories aren't helping us right now.

you must be kidding...of course it helps 99.999% of the time.

@_date: 2014-05-07 15:11:49
Yes people who bought at $1000+ were smart to buy and hold.  Sure they could have cut their losses quickly and bought back 2x as many BTC now but why would they want to do that?  
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:39:37

Yep...bitcoin is failing to catch on very well or at least going very very slowly....
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:49:27
yes those lazy and deceitful f*ckers love quoting out of context.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:57:16
just because you aren't smart enough to daytrade, doesn't mean that no one else is either.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:07:57
Yeah plenty of names with Gox and where did that get you?   Karpeles is free and $500 million of your money is gone.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:51:32
Cold storage is public key and private key just like any other bitcoin address.  So as long as private key is not compromised, then still cold storage and still safe.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:34:02
Your argument is absurd because many companies have closed.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:48:01
yes and that problem is what this discussion is about. So you think we should just ignore the problem?
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:36:45
you must be kidding...something like $500 million in bitcoin were stolent.  Do you really think he would have made more than that over the long term from running Mt Gox legitimately?  
No, of course not.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:05:21
So shouldn't say any bitcoin exchanges have good security record because they may not have it in the future...forever?  
Yes people did say it of bitstamp because they were reliable and secure up to that point.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:04:49
Only problem is that you can't daytrade btc from your cold storage.  And maybe you don't want to daytrade, but many people do, and double and triple their BTC holdings that way.
And not disagreeing with you, just saying it's not that simple for everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:05:22
it won't crash to $50 tomorrow but in a year or two, it could..and people won't just buy them up the same way they didn't do so at $400

that doesnt' help you when a bus runs into your head...or when you fall off a cliff.

Since when?   I would suggest this guy make up a story that he is selling something other than bitcoins.  Be pragmatic, not idealistic here.
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:40:25
i doubt it because he's not dumb like you.  He's a multimillionaire and the reason is because he is smarter than you. 
Go work you wageslave job you loser... and stfu.
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:42:58
Their lackeys have already pretty much killed bitcoin.  But yes good to have many other ways to destroy it even more completely if they want.
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:22:27
Yes I agree...even if just 10% risk of insolvency, why keep your money there?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:53:38
Is there a "scamcoin" yet? I'm sure people would be signing up for that one too.  You can't guard against that type of stupidity...got to be a small % of people who fall for it and they are best left to fall by the wayside.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:27:52
he wouldn't buy them all in one day..you could buy 30K over a few weeks and not move the price much.  And of course also buy from multiple exchanges.  And if you bought in a downtrend and let the sellers come to your price, then wouldn't necessarily move the price up at all.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:34:11
Judge does what he is told and was told to sentence for life.
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:05:46
Well they can already do that with Paypal.  The reality is that huge popular musical acts (like 50 Cent) only exist due to record company promotion.  Not saying he isn't talented but no one would know about him if it wasn't for the record companies (and mainstream media) promoting him incessantly.  They all take their cut for doing so.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:53:31
No, but it is good that it's up something like 500% in the last 2 months...vs -2% for the dollar.   This is not even the point, but if you want to go there, then it's just clear how delusional you are (or just really bad at math).
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:54:06
no not really..most of the time but far from always.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:29:09
It is against Paypal rules to sell any non physical goods..well for the most part.  So of course anyone can dispute the transaction and of course they will win. It's the same if you sell a gift card code or game code or anything else that isn't physical.  
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:45:51
Yes they want thousands of coins at well below the market value.  I want thousands of coins myself...at $1 each.  That doesn't mean anything to the market or overall direction of BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:11:05
I just posted this on their FB page too.
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:20:53
nope...not same thing and not same "difference"
It is different, plain and simple.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:34:13
maybe it will happen after the singularity

yes I would not shed a tear if some Justice was done in this case.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:44:57
You had me until localbitcoins should control the price for trades that consenting adults conduct on their site.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:13:23
Bitcoin already did fail and largely for the reasons you've stated.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:42:17
If bitcoin use is growing there, it is shrinking somewhere else to offset it.  The bitcoin transaction volume in USD is flat and has been for months...just stagnating.
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:45:25
"need"?  That means "I want"
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:30:15
If this is even for real, you aren't getting her fired.  She is getting herself fired by doing a shitty job. You are screwing over all her coworkers by keeping this a secret and them having to work with her and her making them all look bad.

Yeah tell that to all the people rotting in jail for decades with marijuana related convictions.
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:29:04
yeah like that will happen.
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:44:55
No because saying abortion is none of your business is the same as allowing it.   And if gay marriage is not legal then of course the gov't has to make a choice, because they already did.  If they choose that "it's none of their business", then would have to make it legal.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:21:10
When I try to do almost anything on the site (including file a Mt Gox claim), I get:
"Invalid Request

Conbase has been f'ing customers over like this since 2013.  I bailed on them long ago...evil evil company.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:19:24
They aren't Hollywood actors or paid spokespeople.  They are businessmen and maybe public speaking is not their strong suit...but every time I've seen them interviewed, they seem very intelligent and articulate.
You sound like one of the people who say that Elon Musk is terrible public speaker..he does just fine too and what comes out of his mouth is brilliant.
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:40:24
Alt coins are just as "digital" and "real" as bitcoin.  Even if few are used by mainstream merchants, they could be used as such and you can convert most into bitcoin to use anyway.

Fraud in the bitcoin world seems to be about 99.9% at times.  
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:17:46
You still have to create the wallet on a computer...and any kind of mistake with the "entropy" (whatever that is) means that you could lose your bitcoins.
And if you give some complicated or esoteric way to create the wallet, etc that only reinforces the point that very easy to not create a wallet securely enough.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:18:31
It's already too late.....it was pretty much game over after Gox and then Bitstamp, etc, etc.   The regular, common person will never accept bitcoin now...game over.
@_date: 2015-03-12 03:04:08
Yes exactly..it is a way for them to increase profits by deceiving and cheating customers.   They did this to me once and cost me $1000.  and they canceled the buy order less than an hour after I was supposed to receive the BTC...after they took my money from my checking acct 5 DAYS BEFORE.
Conbase are crooks...plain and simple.
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:18:33
yeah like most people are going to do that (or can even figure it out)
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:08:50
Yeah I think "slowly" is the key word.
@_date: 2015-03-12 03:32:55
yes...euros are probably safer than bitcoin.  I have BTC myself but i know it is very risky.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:19:14
No genius...customers aren't going to wait 1 day to get their BTC because that is absurd.  
@_date: 2015-03-15 05:52:50
of course it is sometimes...rarely, but sometimes and this is one of those cases.
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:10:13
Do you have to provide a sample of your DNA to use it like the other ATMs around the country?

It's ok to film video vertically in some cases, like if you are close to a vertical subject.  In this case, I think it was the wise choice because it is mostly Carrie riding the bike and you got more of her body with the vertical orientation.
But definitely something you generally want to avoid with other vids.

@_date: 2015-02-22 16:08:45

Where are you buy and hold people who will tell them that even if they bought at $1200, it was smart because it will be higher eventually.
Anyway, yes if you got your butt kicked by BTC, you can make it back easily so don't go off yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:46:53
If you read the FAQ, it sounds even worse than Coinbase (and that is pretty bad).  THey charge 3% commission on buys and doesn't sound you can even trade with other people (just like CONbase)
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:31:04
exactly...I don't believe this for a second.  The regulations will be coming soon, and fast and furious, and more and more restrictive.
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:06:41
What ungrateful fools that family is (if this story is even true).  Why would they expect a tip to begin with, much less a $100 one??  That seems overly generous and they should have appreciated it. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:44:52
You didn't have to give him an option. I delivered pizzas for years and so many people don't tip at all. I would have appreciated anything, especially $5 in bitcoin even if I didn't know what it was.
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:04:27
yes unfortunately it's not quite that simple. There are many people in prison for doing whatever they want...victimless "crimes" between consenting adults but they still lost their freedom.

Yes it was not a "bubble".  If Apple stock is at $800 and some one blows up their headquarters, and their stock goes down to $400 overnight, does that mean the price was at a bubble stage?  Of course not.
BTC got cut in half due to a change in fundamentals in China. Every one of those big drops was right after new bad news was released.
Got to love the simpletons with their overly simple conclusions.
