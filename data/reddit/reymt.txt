Over production is pretty damn expensive in a high tech market.
And even if you upgrade, it takes a long time until new factories and supply chains are fully usable.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:19
It's a "tough guy speak" for investors, it's boring people trying to make themselves look exciting. Holding on to something you consider a losing property is stupid - and that is the one thing that should count, not some stupid idea about honor and being a man. If you hold onto your investment, them merely because  you think it might go back up.
And in the case bitcoin, they also look pretty clueless just about right now. Crypto currency is currently built like a pyramid/ponci scheme, and Bitcoin in particular it's a massive waste of ressources and energy that countries might not tolerate for too long.
Maybe crypto has a future, but not as an investment gag and not at the current values. With the current volatility, it's pretty useless as a currency either way, so there is no point in holding onto it for ideological reasons either; bit ironic that it's value is inherently measured against dollar, because you know, dollar is an actual currency that means something.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:36:23


Gotta say I have too very much disagree here.
Gold was used as a storage because it's material, which people hoped it would always retain most of it's value. Not so popular these days, becaus it's price turned out more unstable than people thought.
Crypto is completely unusuable as a stored value, because it's volatile. That's the litteral opposite you want from a storage.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:06:33
Bitcoin has no value in itself - and no, as a currently it is a total failure, because it lacks stability. Which is shown by it's value being measure in dollars, euros or yen, because those currencies have stability and their value means something.
The only thing giving Bitcoin the current crazy value are investors. And when one investment round after another is the one thing increasing the value, then you got a ponzi/pyramid scheme; with the difference of BTC it being an inadvertent scheme.
This really goes for most cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:54:22
Idk, I expect it to be the opposite: Volatility dies down and it might get a niche for products and services.
But I think one of both is unavoidable, good point that it might go the other way. I wonder if the investors who burned their hands really go back, though?


I think that shutdown might be part of why the value is crashing right now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:37
Yep, this is pretty damn extreme and has happened never before liek this, hence it's not comparable to older crashs. That's my point\^\^
The question is if Bitcoin as a speculative object will survive that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:45:33






English just isn't my first language, but I'm not surprised you didn't thought of that possibility, on the internet. Thinking aint you're strength, ain't it? ;)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:20:41
Remains the question if it burned the well. We'll see.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:22:06
Yeah. I'll hedge my bets for now.\^\^
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:37


You mean the common reaction to a ponzi scheme?
Maybe you don't get investment, but "market panic" is the normal market. Stock market is built on perception.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:13
So you're afraid of words? You just didn't understand my argument, so I explained it. 31 dollar wasn't Bitcoins "high point". 20.000 dollars is.
When bitcoin crashes and investors maybe lose a million dollar of value, then it's different to a crash that might destroy 20 billions.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:53
So your argument is "all value is temporary"? Well yes it is, and currently the dollar is a stable currency that is considered to have value. 
Ignoring that, is ignoring reality. At that point you could go as well fullon anarcho communist and says nothing matters.


Exchangeable against goods? How many stores do you think use BTC? Good luck using them in your local grocery store, it'll be about as succesfull as a roman nummus aureus. 
You don't seem to understand that a currency is dependant on stability. People don't want to hear that their bread costs $5 one day, and $500 a year later. Or that they savings halved in the last two monts, or that their mortgage trippled in halve a year.


And here is the funny thing, that completely and utterly ruins your point: Nobody gives a shit what you think, least of all the investors that determine the value of bitcoin!
Most people see bitcoin as a way to fast money, and that's what makes it both an investment object similar to a ponzi scheme and completely fail as a currency.
No rationalizing will fix that conflict, that is reality. If you thought BTC was worth 20k at some point because it's a usefull currency, then oh lord, I had bad news for you...
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:33:18


That a bank is a pretty damn complex thing? Which makes the comparision kinda absurd.
And you can also just store thousands of dollars at home. Yet in neither case have you any control over the fluctuating value.


Because it's volatile as shit. That's not a good thing if you want to long term store money. Who knows what it's worth next month?
Idk if people just get impressed by high numbers, but the changing worth of bitcoin makes it pretty useless as a currency for transactions, or a way to store money. Stable value is a requirement for useful money, that's literally the point of the thing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:19


You don't actually want a "currency" to rise in value. Super slow inflation is generally the goal, which is why the "constant" drop of the dollar isn't necessarily a bad thing. That is why crypto isn't a currency atm, but an investment...


... and I'm fairly sure you make the most money if you sell during the drop, say 15k, and then buy again at what you think will be the newest low point. And even that is making the pretty large assumption that it'll get back up.
Holding doesn't seem to make much sense with purely speculation driven investments. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:02:26


You mean when a BTC was worth less than a at 1.000th of it's current value?


Because things always repeat and context doesn't matter.
Financially illiterate people that think holding and believing is a quality.


So he's going to risk losing money if he now sells at a higher value than when he bought it? Well that's a horrible risk, ain't it. Better hold to that volatile stock, just to be save.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:46:24
Thanks, that's brillant. Also almost perfectly describes bitcoins course, dropped from 3000 to 2000 in the bear trap, and 16k in the bulltrap.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:10:24
You know those people were completely right? The currency is crashing down atm, so I'm fairly sure they're smirking right about now.


Errr no, this is the first time bitcoin crashes from it's high point. Not sure why you're pretending this is a regular thing.
edit: Since, it's to vague: Bitcoin burns billions right now. Never before did it lose that much money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:50:58


I wouldn't have made the comment when it had dropped from $32. The hype and massive inflation hadn't yet happened. That stuff happened when it went over 10k.
If it had recovered back then, that doesn't mean it has to recover now in the same way, in the currently very different market with very different sums involved. Idk what else to tell you, that is just common sense.
-&gt; 1mio loss of value? Large investor probably doesn't worry too much.  
-&gt; 20billion loss of value? You sure he does.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:17:49
Look at the edit, lots of people misunderstood that point. I don't consider 32 bucks a high point when it got to 20k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:55
Already dropped by 50% since the 20k point. :D
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:42:57
Anyone with common sense knew that before, capitalist shrink and growth cycles aren't something new.
However, the idea that you can better control crypto is... ludicrous.
1 Dollar is worth 82% from what it was 2006. 1 Bitcoin is about 50% from what it was maybe two months ago or so?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:01
If you were so smart, you would have sold at 15k, and then bought again at the lowest value of the current drop.
That's how most of the real, short term investing goes. You don't just "hold", you check the courses every single day and invest accordingly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:12:39


I know, that 'you' was hypothetical person pointing out the ridiculousness of that idea.


Well, I guess I'll let you believe that, if you then feel better about your day ;)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:18:57
If you ignore any context and nuance, then yes. Just completely misses the point.
edit: Actually now, I did specify the amount of money that was burned. So you're just wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:51:52
Bitcoin has never buned so much money as it does right now, never in it's point of existance. That's what I ment with high point.
The last ones where on 3-&gt;2k and a drop from 20 to 16k. Stake and losses were a lot lower in those.
The current crash might be the one to break BTC, at least as a speculative investment. People who like the idea of a currency should be happy about that, gives it space to normalize.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:34:38


True, and maybe it'll normalize with that function at 100 dollar or so. Who knows?
But with the current BTC, it's ultra-volatile, and therefore near useless for exchange. If it can stay stable for a few years or so, it might even be commonly accepted as an alternative currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:01:22
I'd imagine most people bought in at &gt;10k, because that's how you got the price to 20k in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:09:39


Did I write at the time? No?
Then I probably ment the all time high. Seriously, don't you people get how stupid it is trying to explain others their own comments? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:02


No, BTC never lost so much money as it does right now. A drop from 32 to 2 dollar is something quite different, at that point it wasn't a big deal in any way, shape or form.
If you compare the course of bitcoin, you see very clearly how it traces the bubble.


First of all, go and invest everything you own if you want, I'm not telling you to stop.
I was more curious about your understanding of the investment and... honestly, you seem to miss something. There is generally no long term investment into highly volatile objects. Stock market/investment is brutal, and if you're slow, you'll get eaten up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:00:07
If you gotta explain me the meaning of my own post, and completely ignore an interpretation in which my post makes a lot more sense (compared to worrying about the 29 dollar drop), then you are probably in the wrong. 
People like you, with their "gotcha" attitude, are pretty silly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:55
You mean the drop from 31 to 2 dollar, when it was still widely unknown to most people? That's hardly major compared to the league BTC was playing in, at least for a few months.
That is hardly comparable to having the same object drop from 20.000 to below 10.000, while the crypto market reached a limit of 200bn. 
And btw, this is how a classic bubble works:
Yep, those drops are normal. Bitcoin even had those two, smaller "traps", one drop to 3k to 2000k, and one at the top to 16k. The current drop is far too massive to easily recover, there is a shitload of money being burned right now. Investors will remember that, obviously, and that will make this crash very likely the big one killing the hype.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:01:42
I honestly think this is negative news.
As long as crypto is used as speculative investment at the stock markets to this degree, the resulting volatility kills the use as a (short term?) currency for payments. That's why I really don't like crypto right now.
The one cool thing about crypto was the anonymous, universal payment - that's potentially groundbreaking **IF** it gets accepted commonly. And yes, I just made this into a negative, but I think my point holds?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:53:17
Lets be frank, if you can't predict those course, then you really shouldn't invest. 


You see, that's your mistake. You believe in a long trend when there really is no indicator for that trend, the whole thing has no inherent use (far too volatile for a currency). Bitcoin currently works like a classic bubble.
Someone posted this cute thing, and I think it describes bitcoins development perfectly:
Bitcoin had those drops to 2k and 16k, and according to this, we'd be inbetween fear and capitulation.
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:06:21


That's another convoluted way to say "things change". Sure, but not really an argument for bitcoin.






Not sure if you're aware of it, but you haven't made any argument in favor of bitcoin. Not a single one.

@_date: 2018-09-13 13:16:59
You didn't lay out anything. You said the currency is being manipulated and nobody belives it. Which is already nonsense, because it's constantly in the news that the interest rate is set by the banks.
See, the most basic knowledge kills your main argument and the rest is mostly some gibberish how everyone is blind and manipulated and hasn't yet seen the real truth™ that you have acchieved.
And you frankly also do not seem to understand what makes a currency have value, despite you financing your entire livelihood with exactly that currency.
Not to mention that doesn't even go in to the shitshow of what makes bitcoin have value... FIAT currency is a thousand times more reliable than Bitcoin.

Holy fuck, calm down. You're gong waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far.
The gender reversal day is a generally just a day in school, where the boys wear womens clothes, and the women wear typical male clothing.
It's a lecture in empathy; it's supposed to give you a bit of a feeling how others (eg a different gender) might experience the world differently. Nobody in their right mind thinks genders are or can be reversed on a spot.
At very least, it's a funny, silly thing to do. Not fucking cultural marxism.
In my schools we also had a day where we wore school clothings and followed traditional rules from school in the 50's. A few interesting days to learn how school in the past worked. But nobody thought that made us time travelers.
edit: I think he's trolling now, but funnily enough, the idea that clothes define you is a very capitalist concept.
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:05:54
Honestly, most of the times I hear about "cultural marxism", it seems to be right wingers implying something is marxist/communist when it's really not. Which seems to fit perfectly in this case.
Same way US left wing publications love to fearmonger with the "alt right", which I still haven't found out what it's supposed to be and who actually calls themselves that way.

So yes, it is a right wing conspiracy theory.

Nice, my assumption was correct. but that history is actually worse than I thought.
@_date: 2018-10-06 22:00:42
Is that chart actually implying the upswing to 20k was an expected and perfectly normal development, that can be problemlessly taken as a base for his statistics? Or put another way, he is implying the value development of bitcoin from its inception to the 20k is a natural rhythm to bitcoin.
Sounds like just another wannabe bitcoin expert without any credencies to back it up. If you take financial advise from people like that, then that's your own fault. But hey, he got a fancy colorful graph.

Propaganda is generally misrepresenting facts. Saying Bitcoin uses a lot of energy is true on its own.
@_date: 2018-10-07 10:12:00
Just because you can make something look like a pattern on a graph doesn't mean you should. The rise to 20k was extraordinary, its not reliable to go from there. As long as Bitcoin doesn't just explode in value by a factor of 10 before dropping hard, but thats rather unlikely.
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:51:57
I think this one might be placed by a marketing agency. A fairly mediocre one, tbh.

@_date: 2018-06-27 19:44:11
That can be said about any object you use as a tool for intermediate trading, though. Gold is generally accepted because the market determines it to have a stable value (which is because of peoples expectation towards gold, not it's physical value as a product).
Nobody converts to gold and back just for a transaction.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:58:07

You mean the thing that was at $2.000, then went close to $20.000, and now is at $6.000, all in the span of a year, is a good way to store money?

Because Bitcoin is stable, unlike Fiat money?
Very funny. The whole pyramid scheme investment bullshit in Bitcoin, which people love to celebrate so much, is the reason what makes Bitcoin a terrible currency. Going from 20k to 4k to 10k in less than a year would be a fucking nightmare.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:27:08
So asking for an actual argument in a discussion is "being a troll"? And you think you're perfectly fine to insult someone for having a different opinion?

@_date: 2019-06-15 22:29:04

@_date: 2019-12-01 22:31:55
A decade isnt much either, and the usefulness of data without comparisions is limited anyway.
Anyway, you ignored the relevant argument I was making.
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:03:48
Thats going from disastrous to slightly less disastrous. I mean, even using data that goes from 2017 to 2019 is an absurdly short timeframe for currency evaluation of any kind, that doesnt even filter out statistical errors.
Now you have a slightly less disastrous volatility of bitcoin (but still completely unfit for a currency), and a high level of stability of Euro/Dollar. And your choice is bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:06:35
But then you want to invest into currencies/assets that are stable, if you worried that fluctuations could hurt/destroy your wealth.
Investing into something that is still highly instable, like Bitcoin, is exactly the opposite of what you want to do.
@_date: 2019-12-01 11:13:18
So you got into bitcoin for financial stability? Are you actually serious?
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:53:38


Why? What's the purpose holding onto a volatile asset? Instead of, say, just buy it in two year when necessary.

Core of nuclear problems is that we got nuclear plants since more than 60 years, yet we still only got possible solutions and that one storage facility in Finland.
I think that's a fact reporting on it's own; it's not really LWT's job to figure out solution for nuclear waste.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:31:46


The positives are very obvious and known, IIRC he did say them. It's generally clean energy (obviously besides logistics).   
Done, that's it.
The problems are the much more interesting part, because the nature of their problems differentiate the energy sources.
I mean, your point is "he should have portrayed nuclear in a better light". That's like you're asking for making propaganda. And that's not really the point, **LWT is about problems that people should be aware off**.

Eh... you understand that they're not actually saving money in the traditional sense, they're "earning money" just by it sitting in an account? It's like an investment, not different to what you do at the stock market (ignoring dividends).  The problem is that storing that money might generate more value than investing would during deflation.
In turn investments diminishes, and I doubt you'll find anyone that that's the sign of a healthy economy.
Of course you just take whatever you need for yourself from that account; that should be obvious.


Idk what Mises is, but writing that, you managed to present it in the worst possible light.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:31:34

@_date: 2019-01-08 21:11:16
Your entire answer was built on telling me I was wrong for using the term deflation in the common sense. It's funny you're trying so hard to excuse that behaviour.
Nah, I was correct with that assessment and you're just being incredibly petty.

@_date: 2019-01-06 23:04:03
If you can guarantee constant deflation over a long term, then it is good for you - but it is also a catastrophe for an economy, because it heavily discourages investions; why put money into risky ventures, when you could just have it accumulate money by itself?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:46:37

Why? And is there, under the dozens of currencies, not a single currency that is as secure or more as Bitcoin?
That's a pretty stark claim to make on it's own. And claims should either be proven or argued for, yet there is not a single argument for BC's security.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:06:19


How full of yourself are you to actually be able to write that, considering what follows? This is almost a stunning degree of ignorance. But let me instead explain to you why nobody understands you; and I can assure you, it's not other peoples fault:


Basically, you get how people generally use the term, but instead you use it differently.
As to why the fuck you then do not open up with "this is my definition of in/deflation for bitcoin" when you know that it causes misunderstandings all the time, I cannot tell.
How do you instead go the idiotic route of saying "you're all wrong" just because people use the term differently? It's a matter of viewpoint, not "rightness", and you're on pretty thin ice as an outlier with no apparent financial background.
It is incredibly petty to the point of dellusion to talk that way. Do you enjoy that stupid banter, does it give you a feel of superiority because you're able to say "most people are wrong" by following crooked logic?
Not to mention your actualy argument is pretty trash too. FIAT currencies are designed to be inflationary too, and if anything, the Bitcoin growth will became slower and slower over time, since it becomes harder to mine, ergo it's not designed to have an infinite growth in coins.
And you can hoard all currencies to drive up prices, but only in FIAT can you print infinite money.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:05:05
You're not really answering my question why you should hold onto the bitcoin.

Seriously, people read 'x earned millions', but they never ask who actually lost that money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:28:55
That's what I'm saying. The value of money is slowly decreasing; with an inflation low enough to keep stability, but also continual enough to keep people spending and companies and inventing. At the same time, the state debt gets cheaper because the debt money loses value.
In a ponzi scheme, you do not continually lower the value of an investment object, but rather do the opposite: You want the value to explode and reach a hight-point. Then you sell off just before the value crashes down.
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:51:44
What you say has nothing to do with my comment. That:


Is deflation. Full stop.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:15:59
He was talking about the period of deflation.
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:05:40
The definitions I'm talking about are pretty much bog standard. Devaluation is an active policy.
Inflation and deflation don't describe the amount of money; increasing supply and deflation can even coincide. They purely describe value development. As in, what products do you get for a specific amount of money, say 1 bitcoin. Deflation is when a unit of money gains value, inflation is if it loses value. The 2000% up were obviously a massive increase in value.
Obviously, the value of bitcoin right now is directly determined by how it's traded agains other currencies, but that has very real implication as to what goods a bitcoin can afford you.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:09:49
So two bads make one right?
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:47:25
An economy thrives on money being invested into new businesses, projects and innovation of existing projects. Both from private investors, investment funds or just something as simple as companies improving their own products and services.
But all of those investments carry risk with them. So if deflation hits, then all of that spending will be discouraged, since during deflation your money increases in value by itself, without you actually spending - or risking - anything.
As an example, if deflation ist at 5%, then your money's value will rise that much every year, maybe even more thanks to interest rates. So why would you ever invest money into projects that promise less gain than that? It's hard to beat 5% perfectly safe annual profit.
That's pretty much the reason why classic currencies are preferably held at minimal inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:44:56
Yup, the ponzi scheme accusation relies on the assumption that Bitcoin will continue to crash down; at most stagnate at a fraction of it's high point value.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:43:34
It's been a while, but I think Oliver also had a big segment about the planned long term storage facility, which had constantly failed due to politics, didn't he?
Would mean he was protraying the best solution already.

I thought the government was controlled by companies and banks, a not politicians?


What? It's an investment object traded at stock exchanges, that drives and lowers the value, regardless of what you personally are doing. The days of the innocent, underground currency are over for now.

That's kind of a moot point, since it isn't an either or.

You don't want to give it into the hands of elected buerocrats either. Imagine a parliament could set the level of inflation, or just infinitely print itself money...

I wanna deliver a counter argument, I find your points a bit shallow:


Technology changes all the time; we just learned all consumer CPUs of the last 10 years have massive security flaws. And it actually became clear that it is very easy to track down users of bitcoin, because all transcation are saved forever and offer enough information for identification. Anonymity is already gone, might even be less secure than classic bank transaction.


That one is dishonest. First you argue with "it's the first", which certainly isn't real value. The original inventors of planes, phones, bulbs, and microwaves all got screwed. Look where myspace is these days, they were huge once.
And "backed by maths"? Straightup lie, that does not make any sense. Maths is a study of numbers and application, you need to apply it somewhere and draw parallel to make an argument. 2+2 makes unquestionably 4 in a decimal system, but that itself doesn't translate to any insight about the real world.


You say it yourself: Scarcity and value usually makes a high price. Weird that you only managed to argue for scarcity, not for the value. Scarcity alone doesn't make an argument, and there was no actual argument for the demand.


So you say it's superior to other currencies? I guess we just gotta believe you on that one, considering no one actually understands crypto and anyone claiming the opposite is wrong. 
You say it so, so it has to be true, doesn't it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:18:17


Fixed it. Haven't seen anything get freed by bitcoin, but oh boy, is it a benefitial scheme to a selected few. Also a giant waste of ressources.
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:11:30
So you don't do the first, but you're gonna recomend it to others and are unwilling to explain why? That seems kinda dishonest.
I can give you an answer, though: There is no benefit in holding to an asset that doesn't generate value and won't rise in the very near future and is otherwise abundant in supply.

Bitcoin contributed to the electricity problems in China, that's why they (IIRC temporarily?) banned it in the first place. They are already massively expanding their electricity production, as all those other countries. Bitcoin is neither needed nor productive in that regard.
Also, miners don't care if that surplus electricity is needed 'afterwards', so it's a bit of a moot point. They majority is all about greed.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:02:13
If you burn down a town, and then rebuild it, then that can cause a GDP growth as well; despite being a setback on the greater scale. I'm not even sure if Bitcoin would even get counted as GDP.
Currently Bitcoin is this: A lot of people lose money, a tiny group wins a lot of money. That's how you get those Bitcoin millionaires 'out of nowhere'; although at this point it's probably mostly speculants. 
That is worthless as economy.


After **they** have done the damage, they're just going to 'fix' it? There is no fixing here, and I don't see where all those altruistic bitcoin miners are, or why they'd be mining money in the first place if not for easy cash.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:03:50


A surplus usually exists as a buffer; if there is too much electricity, you turn down power plants. There is already dynamic production, to a degree.
It's a bit nonsensical to argue it as a plus that power companies can build up capacities that wouldn't even be necesary without Bitcoin. I'd bet the cost is why most of the mining happens in china. Cheap, dirty energy for maximum profitability.  
Boosting the economy short term with little regard for environment is the problem China and the world have in the first place, yet the guy in the video wants to sell it as an advantage.
It's really absurd to defend, creating Bitcoin is literally burning finite ressources to create money, and lets not even speak of the ressources from the high tech electronics being consumed while doing so. This is absolute and utter decadence.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:48:12
AFAIK you should check every day and wait until jumps upwards 10 to 20%. At that point you might bet on the up swing without a massive risk (and sell with minimal loss if the course drops again).

Those are hollow phrases and ideology, though. Not factual arguments.

Wait a sec!
Are you doing the thing wher you deflect the accusation of Bitcoin being a ponzi scheme by instead accusing FIAT currency to be a ponzi scheme themselves? (which would be completely irrelevant to bitcoin)
Besides, FIAT can't be a ponzi scheme in the first place, considering the banks keep it at low inflation. That's the literal opposite, just slightly pushing people toward spending money instead of harboring it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:51:52
Yep. Regardless of opinions about bitcoin, it's waste of energy is a disaster.
It's wasting a shitton of energy just to make money... that's decadence for you.
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:26:00
But think about all the people that made money on your losses! :D
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:45:56
So we're inbetween capitulation and despair considering the development? Still seeing a lot of rallying calls on this sub.
To be fair, bitcoin owners do benefit from telling others to hold their money, that's pure self-interest. I wonder how many have seen through that yet.

I mean... crime is a social construct, isn't it? 
In the most basic sense, crime is a tool to discourage unwanted behaviour inside of a community.

That's a fairly useles comparision, considering we're talking about a 2 year frame.

Money laundering is moving profits from criminal activities in order to make it look like legitimate income to the authorities.
It's not really a crime in isolation, but rather acitivity that is part of a criminal scheme.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:58:09
So you're agreeing with money laundering being an implicit part of a crime? If you consider the state a criminal gang doesn't affect that deduction.
So I think that would qualify as not being  "a made-up bullshit crime ".

So, I'm dishonest because I'm saying the original, gold-coupled dollar isn't exactly the same as the purely virtual pyramid scheme that is bitcoin right now, and hence it can't be compared?
Do you even think about what you're writing? You're going "I can compare two different things, and this means something", without actually understanding how the act of comparision works or what it's useful for. 
You're failing at the most basic logic and then return with ad hominems.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:07:05


You mean bitcoin ish sound, as in hard money? Because it would be ultra soft if the value development is any indication, and it hardly even fulfills the requirements of a currency.


To actually know what is an equivalent year, you'd need to know the future development of Bitcoin; there are almost no similarities between bitcoin and dollar, so its a bit of a moot comparision. Might as well compare the value of dollar and the stock price development of google.
I mean, none of the bitcoin supporters expected such a bad drop, didn't they? The bitcoin to dollar/euro course right now shows no sign of recovery at all.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:41:48
It is being criminalized by being a very specific action in support of a criminal operation, pretty much the same way as knowingly dealing with stolen goods, fencing, is considered a crime.
To put it in a more expansive way, directly supporting organized crime is generally partitioned into a number of seperate crimes, because of how complex said criminal operation can become, and how many steps can be inherent to the chain of crime, from theft to final recipient.
I feel there is a pretty good justification for having those second hand crimes, considering you are enriching yourself by supporting the crime; you cannot claim that you have no connection to the wrongdoing or aren't directly encouraging it. You are doing damage to society, and that is why the concept of crime exist.
Of course you can still say you consider the act 'not criminal', at which point we just got different opinions.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:41:33
Yes, Bitcoin is a more reliable currency to store value, because of its legendary stability and non-volatile nature.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:59:37


Bitcoin is not a currency, hence such a comparision is inherently pointless.
But it is funny to see you interprete my well argued refusal to engage in fuzzy logic as a proof of your own correctness. That kind of confidence in your own bias, to the point of delusion, is the true mark of a fanatic.
