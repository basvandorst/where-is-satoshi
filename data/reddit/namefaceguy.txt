Yea instead of investing in crypto I'm going to try to actually do something to become wealthy.

Because I want to focus my energy on bettering myself and the world and I feel like cryto is eventually going to be used to track every dollar we spend instead of protecting privacy.  Just another way to glean info from people to sell it to someone else.  At least that's my current theory.  I thought I would say something to break the circle jerk.

Jordan Peterson hate speech?  What are you talking about.  Just trying to link him to Steve Bannon?  If anything I see him trying to steer the ship of brainwashed conservatives back to their roots of focusing on bettering themselves before trying to criticizing others.  He spend lots of times explaining to them the worth of the left and how they can go to far in a non threatening way that doesn't push them away.  Just because you have ideological purity and can't even understand anyone that disagrees with any one attitude you have doesn't mean everyone else is some imagined alt right Nazi trying to exterminate everyone else.  He's trying to expose people to the fact that believing the entire world relies on power dynamics based on identity as it's core fundamental principle does nothing but tribalize us all.  This was done in the Soviet Union and the result was continual death and destruction of those who were not as ideologically pure (based on percieved identity, in this case we are talking about race gender and sexual orientation) and then the after effects and so on and so forth.  
Basically this guy is trying to use reason to prevent all out civil war and to go back to respect of values and competence.

Looks like we found the shills.

Lol, no one who is dumber than Einstein can be brilliant.  Brilliant answer by the way.  His level of notoriety has nothing to do with his references in papers.  That was before he became a public figure.  I'm just saying you probably don't even know his positions if you are upset about him.

People that hate him literally hate him because they are told to.  His mischaracterization is so incredible it's hard for people to believe, so they don't.

He's not a pseudo intellectual.  He's a incredibly prolific clinical psychologist, and has been referenced thousands of times in works.  He's actually  brilliant and you don't have to agree with everything he does to acknowledge that.
