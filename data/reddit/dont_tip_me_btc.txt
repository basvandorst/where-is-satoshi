Hey. You leave BAT out of this!

Every single time I've posted this question on etc. I've got the answer that it already works like this. Getting rid of one coin &amp; exchanging it for another is a taxable event, regardless of time (with the exception that &lt;1 year is short term captial gains, and &gt;=1 year is long term). 
Can anyone provide an actual legitimate source to answer this? It's insane how much misinformation is out there on the topic.

Still an awful idea. A lot can go wrong during a 2-3 month renovation. What happens to the property when someone wants out? What if that someone did more of the renovations than the other group and now wants a larger cut? What if the housing market crashes and you can't sell it (even remodeled) for what you bought it for? This is a nightmare of a legal situation that could go wrong in so many ways.
If someone is set on doing something like this, they're way better off getting a loan and doing it themselves rather than 'teaming up' with friends or family. At least that way a failed project isn't going to ruin relationships as well.

No, I don't think that. However, I do know that marriage offers a lot more legal protections for when things go wrong, which is the whole point I'm trying to make.
No matter how good your relationship is, friends(or family) can very easily turn into enemies when things go poorly and money is involved.

This is pretty awful advice. It's not recommended to buy property with anyone you're not married to. Unless your plan was to first marry all of your friends, in which case, I'm not judging.

I never said that. Bolded for clarification:


Could your friend, after losing $30k along with you on this 'investment' turn to you and say "Hey man, no worries!" and truly mean it? Sure, it's possible.
However, it's also possible for him to sue you for his investment back, or try to take the whole property from you. Without a strong contract enforcing how these situations are handled, you're going to have a really messy 'breakup'.

You should head over to and ask them if it's smart to buy a house with someone you're not married to. Without a lengthy legal contract, the answer is always going to be no.

Well, my comment got removed for trying to link to PF, which is something they apparently don't like coming from which I can't say I blame them.
However, all I can tell you is to go to and do a search for "buying a house with a friend" and read all the horror stories of people with "Good relationships".

If you and one other person both have strong renovation backgrounds, both create their own companies (where the funds are coming from) to protect themselves, and meet with a lawyer to write out a contract on how ownership and profit sharing will be handled, then sure, that could work without too many hiccups.
However, at that point, it'd probably be less hassle to just marry the friend (joke).

Huh, that's exactly the reason why I bought my house. Just got sick of dealing with landlords all the time.

Well, if it were me. I'd just set up a recurring payment.

Someone offered me $500 for my first edition Charizard back in the day. I declined because "Someday it will be worth thousands".
