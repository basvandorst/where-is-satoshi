BIP38 is the encryption method of your private key so u need a pass to decrypt it afterwards. 
brainwallet passprase (not recommended) is a phrase or a series of words, symbols, etc whose hash yealds your private/public key couple - it could be memorized and then u dont need a wallet but there are bots searching for easy brainwallets. Not secure unless u use at least 8 random words. Never use less words or sentences!!!

Value is very subjective. More and more people started mining, then it was already hard to get a big number if you want it. So instead of mining you could buy it. First transaction was two pizzas for 10 000 btc.
Last voluntary trade on a given exchange = current market price.
current market price times number of available units = market cap

It works for any kind of market because the price is largely driven by mass psychology. In reality, the fundamentals for bitcoin (adoption, services, popularity) today are way better than 1st Dec '13 but the price is 60% lower. So fundamentals drive the price long term but this kind of analysis is good to say where we stay in the short run.

I think the next big move ($1200+) will not be before late May and June. I would not be surprised if the next leg up is in the fall of 2014 or might even be in early 2015. Keep in mind the returns of 2013 are abnormal. It took around 2 years to break out the $32 all time high from 2011. I might be wrong if the network effect is accelerating. Bitcoin needs time to breath for better, more secure and more user friendly technological developments and services. Take this time and wisely use it for accumulation and diversification in some altcoins.

Gavin Thanks for your efforts in developing the protocol.
- Are you worried about the fungibility property of bitcoin? Could coloured coins or blacklisting destroy the fungibility needed for the functions of money?
- What do you think about the Cryptonote algorithm?

This is not a law or statutory regulation but a guideline on how to pay your capital gains tax on bitcoin. However it is implied from the text that bitcoin is a currency and is treated under the subject of "financial assets". Further inquiries will be made by local trading companies for specific definition.
Automated translation submitted by coincoster:
Income from transactions with Bitcoin declared and taxed April 2, 2014 Personal income from the sale or exchange of virtual currency Bitcoin declared the annual tax return on their tax is due on the total annual tax base (10%).
According to the Revenue Agency for the purposes of tax treatment, income from the sale of Bitcoin currency is treated as income from sale of financial assets. Taxable income and the tax base in this case is the sum of the gains realized during the year specified for each transaction, less the amount of losses realized during the year designated for each specific transaction. Realized gain or loss is determined by the selling price is reduced by the cost of the financial asset.
Income from transactions with Bitcoin declared in Table 5 of Appendix № 5 of the annual tax return . The law does not provide tax forms to apply special documents proving the yield.
The deadline for submission of annual statements of income taxation of individuals, acquired in 2013, expires on April 30. In the same period must be paid and payable tax amount. Model declaration barcode NRA clients can download from the section "Documents for individuals"
Annual tax return may be filed by mail or on-site in some post offices where you will be issued a number. The declaration may be filed in person at the office of the NRA, and electronically signed with a digital signature.
More information for the declaration and payment of taxes and insurance is the NRA website. Telephone consultations are made on the price of a local call in the call center revenue agency. The number is 0700 18 700.

The point of the article is to show that private blockchains are not very useful. Also the thousands of blockchain apps people get excited about are much less important relative to the plain old money function.

why do you think money is low-value high-velocity? The more widely used the bigger the market cap of any currency.

not true - look at history of gold and silver

You cannot compare the established world reserve currency to bitcoin. The value to the USD comes from trust that other will also want it and from relatively stable supply. How do you know that more people use it every year? Anyway, do you think that if suddenly twice more people start using the Swiss frank the price would stay the same?
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:31:46
perfect solution
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:30:51


Yes but in a centralized way. Now they could be done in a way which is secure but permissionless without a central point of failure. This is the big difference.
Please give me a detailed example how a bank can create its own blockchain to settle transactions and what would be the benefits of that.

@_date: 2016-03-09 17:04:53
I agree that bitcoin as it is, without a critical mass of adoption, can still transfer value and time stamp information. The point is that you cannot achieve a world changing notary service or stock exchange without first having a world changing money system.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:56:02
Can you explain what is the benefit of a closed blockchain over a traditional database? I may be missing something here
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:52:42
The value will be kept because of the network effect of money. Even though there are other metals that can be used as money but only gold and silver have any monetary value. Migrating from one money system to another is a huge and painful leap. Also USD dominated world is plagued with problems of debt and money printing but we will migrate to a new system when a good alternative exists. However that shift comes at a huge cost for society - pensioners, savings, people living on fixed income.
I agree with you that bitcoin will evolve in a permissionless way. However we need leadership. Somebody trustworthy need to organize the stakeholders and propose working solutions. Currently most people side with the Core team but that would not be the case if they fail to address something important. A new entity will then take the lead. Leadership is not bad, unless there is obligatory following. Bitcoin is leaderless because anyone can take the lead if convinces the stakeholders - there is competition.

I started at about $110, my current average is around $430 and currently I just hodl and wait. But I never keep cash so all my portfolio is gold, silver, g/s mining stocks and bitcoin+altcoins. Currently 66% cryptocurrency so I need to reach 50/50 otherwise I would sitll buy at these levels. Will sell min 50% of all crypto holdings if btc reaches $2500 and then wait for +70% correction before buying again. Hope that's useful ;)

Dont hurry to make conclusions. In the longer term there will be NO 2 ethers. One will prevail and the second one will completely disappear or will be kept alive by few enthusiast just for fun.

Because there is no natural need for 2. Nature tends to consolidate in the longterm. Standards as well.

Why do we need to attack people so harsh. Lets discuss the way forward not gossip. We need BIG/unlimited blocks and Segwit...
