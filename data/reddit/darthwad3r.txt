"Full nodes maintain a full copy of the blockchain, verify blocks and maintain a mempool of transactions."
When you say full nodes verify blocks. Do all of them verify blocks? Does the verification by everyone crawl upto the genesis block?

Does the node have to start from the genesis block towards the transaction, for every transaction. To simply put; does a node scan the whole blockchain starting the genesis block for every transaction? If not; how can this be reliable?
I'm assuming that it does scan the whole blockchain to validate the transaction being carried out. In this case I am curious about how fast this is; and what measures are taken to make sure this doesn't slow down as transaction sizes grow.

This could spin both ways. If Bitcoin is accepted as a legal currency, I'm sure the government is going to lay a heavy tax on it making it out of reach for those without bank accounts.

Then there's a Brian inverse who sold at $2800, and bought in at $1800 again.
