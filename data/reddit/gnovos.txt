Don't forget, two of the cops of this case were caught stealing money for themselves, too!  They don't even have the moral compass not to steal from the guy they are investigating, and yet they accuse *him* of being the bad one.

bitcoins are special because it's not "IP Theft", since you aren't actually copying their data (though perhaps you can call it a derivative work?), and the "value" is only there because of the authenticity of other machines in the network.  It's entirely possible to have a completely identical "second bitcoin network" that uses the exact same system as the first, that would declare the stolen coins as still valid for use by the original owner.  You could have an infinite number of those networks, all using the same hash keys for the same coins, just different block-chains, making the exact same coin valuable and worthless over and over again.
I guess the big question is, since the value of a bitcoin is determined exclusively by the say-so of the other computers in the network, is it even possible to really "steal" one?  Or do we have to come up with an entirely new concept of theft...

wah, how do people lose backups of such an important thing!?  It's not like it's even very hard...

Yeah, that's why I added the second way, like just sitting at someone's computer with their permission and doing the transfer, or whatever...  i.e. the question is less about *how* I got them and more about is it illegal to "steal" a bitcoin.

I never said it was right, I was just curious about the law concerning digital cash.

The owner may show up in the hospital, recovering from being hit by a bus or something.  There must be backups of the wallet, too, if it's just a hardware problem.  People just need to chill out and wait while it's investigated.

I doubt the NSA would give away a huge espionage secret like having cracked tor just to get a few drug busts.  The CIA, too, would go ape if a secret like that got out.  Telling your enemies that you have broken their codes basically kills that information stream forever.

My $20 investment got me 20 bitcoins a while ago...  :)

This is just the same.  The suspended market will be at crazy wrong prices when they come back online and there will be an explosion of activity to cash in on that as soon as they open.

By tomorrow do you mean today?  Which actual date?

How does "lagging gox" work for making money?  I don't get how it works.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:20:21
is this something they often do?

Lol, if you "cracked" SHA-256 I think you'd have a lot more than bitcoins coming your way...  You'd single-handedly destroy the security of thousands of different markets and businesses.  Keeping it silent would be worth millions! :P

Not until someone proves conclusively that P = NP, but after that all bets are off...  :)
