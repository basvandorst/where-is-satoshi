The only fraud about this is them
@_date: 2014-05-25 09:11:13
No no no. Definitely hundred eleven six.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:42:01
If that is true bitcoin is practically dead
It can't be though.
Satoshi = competent, karpeles is not.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:17:13
That's a surprise. I live there (5 mins from some of these, apprently. Haven't ever seen any signs, but then again, I'm not in town often!
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:59:29
man that dude pulling out is top tier cringe
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:42:45
Damn you really have no idea what you're talking about chum
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:27:43
I have like 0,01 btc that I mined myself right now, which I guess is 'just a little'
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:41:39
You want some too?
EDIT: Doesn't matter, sent ;)
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:42:41
Every day I feel like I'm getting in on this too late. I'll watch from the sidelines with interest though.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:44:43
And people will say it all in between, too.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:31:32
I don't think we want this to happen. Sure, it's market acceptancce, but it's from shitty parties.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:26:49
Where did you get $800 from?

Lost my shit. So hilarious to read this now.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:16:56
No kidding. 'oh, just enter how much you want and you'll get it'. Yeaaaaahhh.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:24:46
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:51:57
You can pay with bitcoins, and as such, it's not just a way of sending money around.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:27:29


Don't drink any, check!


Never eat out, check!


Don't ever go.
Am I a savings master yet?
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:27:49
[I posted it here]( and I'll update that. This version wasn't perfect yet ;)
@_date: 2013-06-17 12:37:11
All I heard that was bitcoin-related was silk road. Not sure if there was anything about TOR at all, honestly. Funny video, but not so much on topic...
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:03:06


@_date: 2013-11-17 12:11:19
I write (Promotion and general articles alike) in Dutch and English and am willing to accept BTC for it. If anyone needs something done, write a comment or send me a message and we can make it work :)
@_date: 2013-08-12 09:32:18
They do, you just have to work there
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:49:20
wasn't it removed from the app store today
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:06:20
This week? Pft, it hit 600 around the time you made that comment!
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:12:37
Has a nice ring to it :)
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:56:53
Thanks, noted
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:20:27
You're right. Crisis averted, bitcoin can keep rising!
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:29:02


Oh boy 90's all over again
@_date: 2013-08-18 15:38:37
Ignore, guy's a shill. check his history
@_date: 2013-06-17 14:14:20
fair point, but neither one was mentioned.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:43:17
Seems to be run by the Ryan guy, maybe a few other guys? I wouldn't know.
You give them your email, they send you an email with how much you need to pay them. When you pay, they send you a gift copy of the game back, which you can then redeem on steam. Clearly it isn't a huge business, but it's a good idea nonetheless, and steam doesn't support btc natively.
Either way, he asked for some feedback and I included this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:20:24
This is a great idea! Posted two already, let's see how it works out :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:18:14
Haha, sweet. Much more fun than tothemoonguy.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:15:33
Wow, thanks! How do I accept it?
EDIT: I guess it was accepted for me?
EDIT 2: Nevermind, got it :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:13:50
Deserves it, too. Great idea indeed (:
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:50:12
Because I don't have any money that doesn't already have a designation right now, sadly
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:55:54
I understand wherer you're coming from, but I, personally, find bullet point flyers incredibly tedious to read. If the start interests me, I'll look up some more info (which I included links for ;) ). It's hard to make a non-messy flier with lots of information, sadly.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:01
Absolutely. It's more of a pain to watch it rise than anything. Would very much like to buy in, but I don't feel comfortable making the investment anymore (nor do I have the monetary freedom to)
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:37:28
I feel like I live in the future as of right now. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:46:36
Not even close
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:51:12
the 'transfer' is instant and irreversible, processing just takes a while.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:53




Yeah, nope.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:17:45
I just wanted to give these guys some exposure for good service. I'm not here to shill.
@_date: 2013-06-02 10:51:50
yes! Finally!
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:46:05
[Original post here]( I'm no designer, so if you have any feedback, go on ahead. I won't hate you for it!
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:38:24
I would! If I could. Have to wait for my paycheck at least... then we'll see if I have enough
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:26:53
This is the most bizarrely James Bond thing I have ever seen.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:28:46
Unlikely. Considering not much has happened it's most likely simply the people expecting more volatility and profits being disappointed and leaving.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:43:08
It would once again become much much harder to buy and sell BTC
@_date: 2013-08-01 13:55:35
because it gives them money
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:52:19
Yeah, noticed that too. I'll change it up a tad later when I get some more feedback!
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:37:27
It´s not really the point of the sub
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:15:41
Ha! It looks like the titanic, slanted chimneys and all ;)
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:16:31
Just 2 weeks before BFL deliver their second batch of preorders!
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:40:58
I can't replicate this. Please use vocaroo as an example
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:23:20
Thank you. I don't know how I can get the design to line up more accurately. In regard to your concerns about the "no [...] other forms of fraud possible" and "100% secure", I would like a suggestion as to what to change it to.
I have changed "is not relying". No idea how that got through. Does anyone have better examples than expensify and amagi?
I also fixed the EM dash. Thanks for your feedback.
[LINK WITH CHANGES MENTIONED ABOVE](
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:11:12
[This is all the BTC price is telling me right now, it seems](
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:52:51
Printed. It's at international paper size, resolution wise.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:36:51
Haha, every little bit helps!
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:11:38
Not asking for handouts, I'm interested in places that aggregate jobs that pay in BTC, for example. I know about but it's not very active yet.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:37:25
Maybe in 20 years I'll have 100 grand!
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:29:03
The first one, absolutely. I also regretted not buying 1 for 75, 50, 20, 1,75 etc. I'm not worried about the latter at all. It's so developed now that even if the concept were to be a scam, the scam still holds value. Satoshi is not making money off transactions, so there's really no gain in it for him.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:35:46
Good point. But even early in the game it's very expensive already!
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:41:36
they *promise*
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:33:24
And in a few months I'll get to regret not buying now some more? :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:54:26
Definitely do, it's a pretty good place!
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:52:09
Also the world became cardboard
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:41:31
[I'm no designer, but I had a go at it anyway!]( I made it a tad more readable, too. Left out a bit of info that might be overwhelming. What do you guys think?
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:05:11
Damn! I was in Kreuzberg right before the huge price increase, my cousin lives there, I'll have to ask him about this. This is really cool to see.
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:02:11
Well no, because all those bills have a tracking number so people can't copy them.
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:42:53
Please explain.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:52:13
Thanks, will do tomorrow
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:19:10
Adults, I imagine. Native English speakers obviously, should be localized for other handouts.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:34:42
I'd rather have read this without the image macros, honestly. Kind of takes away from my ability to take it seriously
@_date: 2013-06-25 10:10:09
Apple doesn't like bitcoin yet, so they deny every bitcoin-related app afaik
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:27:35
Absolutely, but getting in now means I've lost out on part of the startup race. Not saying that it's no longer good to get in, but I would have profited more had I started sooner, is all :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:26:23
I could have bought in earlier.
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:50:40
Not mine, sadly ): Would've made a pretty penny with that!
@_date: 2013-07-02 09:30:45
There's money in it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:39
I did, but I felt the title made the wrong implication so I resubmitted it with a different one. Sorry!
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:58:51
Haha, my mistake. I forgot a word (: But when you put it that way, it does make sense. I'll see if I can find a way to phrase it.
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:26:28
Begging is not allowed.
Also, asking for money in a thread that says 'DON'T GIVE ANYONE MONEY' is pretty ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:22:39
a few days with my gpu a pretty long time ago. Summer last year I think
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:58:09
I lost it when they linked to butterflylabs. Absolute definition of 'I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about' right there.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:50:31
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. Guess I'll sit on my 0.01 btc, haha
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:59:34
Wasn't this posted like a month ago
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:09:45
My gpu was just pretty shitty at the tiem :)
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:52:46
That's a horrible title
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:51:32
Final version [here](
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:19:05
Start spreading the word, talk to people about bitcoin and offer them 0.01 (or a similar amount) for free if they're interested!
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:12:02
I'm sure I will regret it then too haha :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:14:12
Which e, though? ;)
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:35:18
Sure sound like drug lords!
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:24:41
Not sure what you mean?
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:45:27
Easily made a general quote with the changing of a few words.
"There's no market until you create it"
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:51:41
That's due to personal error, though. In concept, you´re pretty (EDIT: SAFE. I MEANT SAFE) :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:03:42
Wow, awesome ride so far. Hope everyone sticks along for the next goal: 10K! We're [on the moon]( now let's head to Mars, everyone!
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:02:28
When I can, I definitely will :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:42:03
Thanks! I hope so too. I'm sure I'll scrounge together some :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:28:48
I'm sure I will. don't think you can get a trading account set up within the day though, can you?
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:23:08
Fair point. I'll see if I can fix it tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:14:25
Seems I'm still conveying the wrong message: I'm looking for things like work obviously, It's not intended to be a begging thread. Working for it is an obvious answer, but how would someone go about finding a job that pays in btc, is what I'm asking. There's lots of resources available on the buying and mining side, but the working for btc field seems pretty barren so far.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:17:45
When dogecoin integration?
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:09:53
I wouldn't call $50 late. I don't think this is the end of the rise either, it's just that feeling of 'Oh I could have profited more if I started earlier'
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:03:09
Can we all stop the 'this is a scam that is a scam' hysteria? Give them some time.
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:13:45
How big is BTC Guild now?
@_date: 2013-04-27 08:46:20
So are stocks and gold and basically anything resellable, though. Sorry, not changing that
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:02:44
It's actually a reasonable question considering the relative exclusivity of it up to now. People that are impaired by, for instance, lack of a bank account, money issues, age, or other policies or situations disallowing them to invest in mining or btc itself, have no good way to access bitcoin as is. Jobs4bitcoin isn't to active either.
