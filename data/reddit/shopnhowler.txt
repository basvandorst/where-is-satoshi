I like this! Mind explaining how you created the bot? Do you see this working outside of reddit?

Bitcoin is great for inexpensive micropayments, and this can be applied to any scale of power generation, decentralized or centralized.
My main question is with a shift in focus in energy production methods is there a way for power utilities to support Bitcoin/altcoins and create cleaner, cheaper energy?

Not sure if you heard of [joel dietz]( but he started a crypto crowdfunding platform via [swarmcoin]( Ideally anyone/team can make their own coin that swarmcoin investors vote to fund, and as the team's product(s) gain value so do their coins. Buckycoin ftwww

First, well done with ChangeTip thus far! I like that people can tip across Reddit, Twitter, Github, and soon Facebook.
I have so many questions. What allows ChangeTip to work across these different media? Are there three different bots that parse each network? What's the main challenge to adding each media, does it differ for each? Why not just focus purely on a decentralized platform like Twister?

interesting that the minimum wage held at $3.35/hr for 1981-1989 (almost a decade)
