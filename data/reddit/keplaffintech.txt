Don't invest what you can't afford to lose...

Why are you suddenly rich if you can pay things in bitcoin? Can't you sell your bitcoin to pay for the articles?

In Australia it is very common for people to use their PayPass debit/credit cards (RFID chip) to purchase things for as low as even a dollar or less (for example a single item from McDonalds). The transaction is very fast, takes one scan of the RFID card and there is no fee for the consumer. A Bitcoin transaction is no faster or easier.

I wouldn't say most people, rather, those who can afford it.

Reading that gave me a headache

This is more like 3 month trend line

Insurance ensures (hence the name?) that you are protected against unfortunate events. Mining with your computer does not give you that insurance, it just decreases the likelihood by an extremely small amount.

But then how do you tell people your address when you want them to send you money?

It's not legal.. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:16:55
Well I suggest that you

Why can't the government just print more money if they want to increase inflation?

Mining to heat is inefficient (from a purely environmental perspective). Many commercial buildings (and even homes) would already be using heat pumps (air conditioning systems) to heat their buildings. These use down to a fifth of the energy required by conventional heating methods.
By switching from these to bitcoin mining, while it may cost less to run, will consume more energy, and create more waste heat in our environment for the same amount of heating.

Those fans will also be emitting a small amount of heat, equal to their power consumption.

Australia does not have 7 character plates. 
You can check if a plate is registered here, and this plate isn't:

Bitcoins are not made of electrons though, nor do they have corresponding electrons. So you can't use them to measure the weight of Bitcoin. It's like measuring the weight of 'Macbeth' by weighing the pen that was used to write it, (or the actors that performed it)

What about a bank transfer?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:28:10
What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:07:08
I think you can do that with cash too.

All the people waiting for it to stop dropping so they could buy at the right price, just bought. There doesn't need to be news or a single whale to back every price fluctuation.

He could find somewhere to spend or donate the 0.00748757 and have a nice clean 1.4.

Who is 'they'? Honest question.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:14:19
But it's not going to get there if nobody spends any.
@_date: 2013-07-18 07:09:25
Is that a question?
