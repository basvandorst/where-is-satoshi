Sad... I hope you stay safe! I hope the Americas can unite more culturally and economically. I'd rather unify with the American hemisphere than with Europe at this point.

And you probably earned bitcoin related questions lol Sorry for the more political questions Haha

From a US perspective, I think US intervention might be pretty bad with how we've "intervened"in the past. It just seems the people might not like it. And it's more complicated with Russia there...
I think Colombia and Brazil intervening would be best. From a Venezuelan perspective, how do you think the people would perceive US intervention?

Do you think there's any chance of Venezuelans voting for a capitalist? Guido is better than Maduro, but he's still a socialist and won't do anything too drastic to fix your economy.

Sweet. I wonder if there's a way to get free elections without conflict or foreign intervention though.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:17:26
Are Colombia and Brazil still considering helping out?
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:55:49
Awesome! I'll check both out! Thanks��

It's not up to the executive.

That's why we need an American economic bloc. All Americans, north and south, need to unify.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:11:15
So, what do you think should happen? You're a fellow American (from the south), so I'm more concerned with what happens to Venezuela than anything in the rest of the world.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:05:32
I think this would be a hilarious solution, but would Venezuelans consider voting for US statehood?
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:59:07
That's what I figured after I bought it lol Still better than nothing Haha
