When was this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:41:32
Pyramid Scheme? hahahahahahaha It sounded hilarious in my head idky hahaha
seriously tho. I saw 1/3 of my salary vanish back when Mt. Gox crashed and BTC went from $1000 to $200. I understand somewhat your desperation, but BTC is in a much better place right now. It will bounce back impo. Just gotta brace yourself everytime an attack or a scandal happen. Don't invest in something you don't believe in. And if you do believe in Bitcoin, then you will have to endure the growing pains that come along with it.
However, whatever you do, DO NOT act impulsively. do some reasearch and make an informed decision. Before you do something retarded that you will regret. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:55:15
Nope sorry

You should be able to stores different coins in one hardware. [Here] ( is a link to one 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:28:20
Hardware wallets are the way to go always.
BUT if you are looking for an app or digital wallet, I would recommend JAXX. Not the best according to some, but i havent had any problem with it and you can trade between cryptos in their platform

I literally was eating a muffin before I clicked, almost immediately started to choke hahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:15:17
�� Go fuck yourself! Fucking troll! Hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:51
lol. they are! just wanted to see how far they would take it. Once u/ryamgram said Disney I was laughing my ass off hahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:11:55
done good luck
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:12:26
Can’t see the video. 
I’m in mobile, idk it that makes a difference 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:39:26
I am not an finance major or anything that may give me credentials. I was there when I bought 1 bitcoin @ 1000 and then it dropped to 225 back in 2013. 
But my prediction for this dip is $6000. ~ 15- 20% drop. I am waiting just a little more before buying $2000 worth. Its just what i am expecting/hoping for AND primarily speculating towards. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:01:21
Don't have to explain, just add link
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:20:06
We definitely need a btc tip bot in this sub
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:31:04
My very biased opinion says Hope. 
I can’t back it up, but it feels different from the first time it got to $1000
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:47:54
I am not sure about his reasons. But why I believe S2X won’t happen is that S2X keeps losing support from Miners and trading platforms. Which may make it harder for miners to be profitable. At the end of the day, which ever coin is best won’t matter, it’s all about which infrastructure has the miners to support it
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:46:03
Relax. Breath. You don't want to sell at a loss, specially if its only a dip. Chill. 
Right not its only -9.30%, but it could recover like *that* once people are done transferring out for BCash. 
You knew what you signed up for when you bought BTC, just give it sometime and step away from the screens and tickers. 
Like I said in a previous comment. I bought back in 2013 at $1000, and then it dropped at $250. Bitcoin is in a much better place now. Relax. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:56:23
"Bitcoin, the company"?
Which company is this?
if you are saying in your first sentence were true. That doesn't make your latter sentence accurate. Just because one "company" is going under it doesn't mean that all of Cryptocurrencies are dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:18:09
You mustn't mention that abomination here! 
But yes, you are right 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:09:49
I love how it looks. Can't Wait.
When it comes to gains/loss. Will it be able to enter different transactions like if one time I bought .1btc at $6000 and another .15btc at $7200. now that we are getting closer to $8000 Will it be able to calculate the net gain from both? Because that is currently the only reason, why I am using my portfolio app. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:34:48
Yup! I love it!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:51:21
What app is this?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:47:45
I thought so too! I've been looking for it for a couple of days after a saw a tip bot in another sub
Now, I know I'm not crazy
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:37:06
Correct me if I am wrong. But didn’t Coinbase State that they would be issuing their own type of Replay Protection? So I guess up to now, hassle can be avoided by just transfering your fund onto that platform
Edit:  WTF why was I downvoted? I was just sharing my input from the email that coinbase sent. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:28:43
In Coinbase, you can use your credit cards. It is a higher fee, but the transaction is instant.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:24:03
Yeah. If you leave them in Coinbase you should be good. I recommend setting up the 2-step authentification that they have. It doesn't take that long and increases the security of your wallet.


Yeah. if you didn't have nerves of steel before you will have to get some now. Watching the prices go up and down like that might push to you to make a wrong and impulsive decision. So try checking on the price the least you can.
*HODL*

Where is your Tesla?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:40:04
Go to settings &gt; Security &gt; Two-Factor Authentication
It will guide you through a series of steps, like download the Authy app, and email confirmation. This requires you to plug in the info required every time you log into a different computer, make a purchase, or try to make any changes to your account. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:01:56
Could you attach a link, so I can be better informed of what you may be referring to?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:49:30
Lighting Network! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:48:07
Not yet!
I think what will help is the implementation of the Lightning Network. Like in with Litecoin. I’ve been able to do small transaction with Litecoin and about 5-10 mins of confirmation time 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:16:29
I didn’t say that main chain has the most miners As of now. But it used to be 100% as agreed from the New York meeting. As time passes, miners and platforms are backing out and back into the main BTC chain. 
But yeah like I said, it’s gonna be crazy. I can’t wait!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:11:21
Then what are r/BTC and r/bitcoincash all about? How come 100% of Miners aren’t pledging to the main Bitcoin chain? If that isn’t a decided crypto community then idk what It is. Also any pro or informative post about S2X gets deleted right away in this sub 
No, I don’t support any of the forked coins, but we can’t pretend that our community hasn’t been divided because of it 
 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:18:29
lol! 
I guess you never worked for a big company. Shit happens man, if one department couldn’t fix it it doesn’t mean that no one can fix it. There are errors and mistakes, but if you just sit back and whine about it on Reddit you are not gonna get jack shit done. Give them a call, no one likes losing clients. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:17:23
Nah, Chill. All the BCashers are cashing out their BTC since they wont be able to make money off the hard fork anymore and trading for BCash. 
BTC wont die, but it will keep decreasing until all those sell orders are completed
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:31:29
Yup that’s exactly what they announced. But yeah if S2X succeeds it will be messy
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:05:57
Hell yeh! Now I’m even more excited. Thanks for spreading the word OP
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:16:15
You are being trolled... don’t believe them. 
Coinbase is a solid company. Just look at half the posts here. But yeah only use it to buy and then transfer your BTC to a hardware wallet.
Also I was also 19, 4 years ago and we weren’t saying YOLO like dumbasses. So fuck you on that! 
But yeah. I suggest that if you really want to know more first search for discussions and read the comments. Right now a lot of posts are being trolled by accounts from another sub,
Good luck to you! HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:20:30
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:07:11
Alright I get what you are saying. But what about the infrastructure of the Blockchain? Won't that start getting worse and worse as more people stay away from mining because the profits are too small?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:02:34
Buy more, sell, trade, buy stuff with it, HODL, etc
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:46:48
What about buying something like a PlayStation 4?
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:10:26
Thanks for your help 
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:43:35
Well if those are the only choices, then wouldn't litecoin have the upper hand? They already have SegWit and are in the process of LN. 
And they capacity is greater too
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:51:53
Could someone explain to me the graph?
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:38:09
Really? Where did you find that info? Also what kind of assets were required for the compliance?
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:39:20
Probably the only legit tip I have gotten so far. Thanks! Once we get more things ready, I will keep you guys posted
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:36:48
Dang, I hope that won't be case
