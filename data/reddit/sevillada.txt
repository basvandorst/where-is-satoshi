Uh oh, I've used my personal chase account for coinbase...hope they don't close it
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:17:55


chase ultimate rewards points. Arguably the most valuable points due to its flexibility. They can be used for travel directly through chase portal or transferred to partners (airlines, hotels, rental cars).
Most people use them to transfer to partners to maximize the value.
i.e. Korean Airlines makes very affordable a round-trip business class or first class ticket to/from Asia, etc. Also makes it cheaper to go to Hawaii, among other places
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:48:34
It's not about that... they want to make sure they are the ones who take your money and run with it :)

I want to know how that conversation goes:
Manufacturer:"yo, sell to gamers instead of miners"
Resellers:"dude, but those whiners always want a discount and the miners are paying retail or above"
Manufacturer:"don't care though, I don't make more because I'm not making more"
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:45:26
Btw, freeze your credit and file police reports for each instance

Well, BF had good sales, so he snoozed...
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:24:40
Did you like it right there?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:31:30
yes, of course, taxes are annoying and due on any earnings. credit card points are "free" of taxes though
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:23:48
if you didn't make thousands, I think you can find more flexibility, since it's based on the honor system. If you made over 20k, the exchanges will report your earnins to the IRS. Say, if you traded back and forth (among coins) in an exchange like bittrex, but used coinbase to buy/sell , there's no point on killing yourself declaring every single transaction. You could say: i bought 1 btc at $100 and sold 0.5 btc at 5000, my earnings are $4950 and pay taxes on that.
Ideally you would declare the 100 transactions that led to that, but it's a waste of everyone's time
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:53:36
Yes, technically it's capital gains no matter where you store it
And technically you are supposed to report every send/receive purchase/sale, but that's not very practical, so...
I plan to summarize.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:58:23
So would AMD's
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:01:39
if it is successful and it causes widespread adoption, yes, I think there's a good chance the value will go up a lot
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:27:53
that would be sad. we really need someone to compete with bitmain. People are waiting to throw money at them, some please just take it!

Damn, he's loaded
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:59:03

I googled it and it looks ok (the ad) , so it's possible google is fine and instead the computer was infected with malicious scripts that redirected it. What computer did you use? Who owns it? Where is it located? Etc etc
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:39:45
the first argument is for bitcoin to bitcoin. i.e. you sold bitcoin only to repurchase  a few days later. The bitcoin to something else becomes secondary.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:02:50
no one controls bitcoin. those are the rules of the game. While sometimes we don't like the players (like scammers), they are part of the "game"
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:58:15
I'll hold verdict until i see. I sure want to see competition against those damn scammers (bitmain)
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:12:32
Agree. My account was also blocked for about a month. Basic verification failed automatically, so I had to do full verification and it took a long time to get any kind of response. I wasn't in a big hurry since it wasn't much...but their service was horrible.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:39:01
I honestly really doub it. There's too many John and Jane Doe coming in with fresh money. Same with wallstreet. There's a ton of money pouring in.

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:26:33
Is there a list of the oldest known addresses known? I.e. someone tracking satoshi and the other first users?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:39:06
i would have said a few months ago that you were insane, but with everything that has happened, the number of new coinbase accounts, and all the wall street-related activity, i think it might just happen
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:38:05
yeah, it's very upsetting, so sometimes we have to move on. When it hit 11k i put my buy orders on gdax for 10400,9400,8600 and 8400 (rough numbers), then the other day when the flash crash happened they were all picke dup and now it's back at 11k and I don't feel too bad :)
obviously I'd be in a better position if I hadn't sold any, but I had also made some good trades when it was wiggling in the 8000-8400 for days
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:09:19
The funny thing is that you can see how they knew right away that hodl was here to stay

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:43:35

One good example is Bolivia's currency i think
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:39:58
and if nobody sold, maybe it wouldn't be worth anything
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:36:54
You don't have to pay taxes if you sell and buy within 30 days as it is considered a wash sale. Also, i think going from btc to any other crypto could be skipped for tax purposes
The easy way would be to declare only US dollars in and out, but not sure what coinbase will provide to the IRS
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:32:17
Lol I'd missed it
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:44:56
that's what i was thinking, full balls-in-the-air/colonoscopy verification with coinbase/gdax should do. Too much to risk in most places/situations

Market determines the price, you are welcome to try arbitrage
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:29
but a lot of those shills say" BCH is faster and with lower fee...yeah, but that applies to pretty much every coin, that doesn't make them better. many are simple pumps and dumps
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:00
If that were true, they would have more than 4 coins

"In Bitcoin, a private key is usually a 256-bit number (some newer wallets may use between 128 and 512 bits), which can be represented one of several ways. Here is a private key in hexadecimal - 256 bits in hexadecimal is 32 bytes, or 64 characters in the range 0-9 or A-F."

thanks, will follow up in there
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:30
even if you withdrew it to fiat, if you reinvested, it would still qualify for like exchange from what I have gathered.
i..e if you buy an investment house (get paid with USD) and buy another investment house, this is pretty much the definition of like exchange, so the fact that you may get fiat doesn't' disqualify, IMHO
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:33:54

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:14:48
I'd honestly recommend putting your sell order on gdax, once that triggers and activity isn't crazy high, go ahead and transfer out.
It should be fine. If you try to cash out of coinbase directly, it may be down when you want to sell
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:22:26

And you can use any other altcoin as well
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:12:43
The thing is that many times you sell high with the hope of buying back cheaper, but that might never happen
Source: happened to me many times
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:24:56
yes and no, it's not as simple. Yes, pretty much all coins can do it faster and cheaper, but they don't have the ecosystem and the money in it. few do. Many are not decentralized, which is the main idea behind bitcoin. bcash is controlled by a few. They control. they could destroy any moment they wanted. they could dump it all and you lose everything. With bitcoin, that is not the case. You know it has a "long history". you can the coins are spread out. You know nobody controls it.
bcash is simply an altcoin, nothing more. For altoins, there's better options, like litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:48
and that's why, I believe, we can go with that sound reasoning and report it as such, if the IRS disagrees then we can discuss it, but the idea is to not act in bad faith :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:23
In your context, there would be more bitcoins...i.e. bitcoin gold and not sure what other made up coins are out there...they give a bad name to bitcoin. They are pumps and dumps
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:03
It's practically impossible. You would need the keys, which would be impossible to get...unless you have a quantum computer and brute-force them i guess
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:13:37
Also, not only people don't go into panic-sell mode, but they also get ready to buy the dips
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:13:46
But we can basically use it for our calculations and if the IRS has a problem with that then they would need to seel clarification no? I didn't make much anyway, so i probably wouldn't be a target
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:47:37
Great to hear you are not the financial advisor that tells them not to buy :)
Do you suggest GBTC at all?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:12
Faster yes, better no. There's thousands of altcoins faster than bitcoin, that doesn't make them better. Bcash shill? Probably..
@_date: 2018-09-11 09:50:06
i just recently found your threads u/sick_silk
have you done some sort of analysis of where those coins came from? I've seen that you've been following where they went, but did you try to see where they came from? e.g. from before 2014?
found the answer here :)

People get confused enough with bitcoin, explaining gdax just adds a level of complexity
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:29:20
So do any other altcoin, that proves nothing
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:40
I think so, but be sure to read up on wash sale rules

I think what i was thinking is more in line with the following, what do you think?
Capital gains on tax real estate investments are due in full in the year in which you sell the property. If you are selling with the intent to exit the real estate investment market, the tax is unavoidable and you have no choice other than to pay the bill in full. However, if you are liquidating a real estate investment and plan to purchase another, you can put off paying capital gains tax by taking advantage of IRS Code Section 1031 and rather than selling your property, exchange it for a like-kind property"

I honestly doubt it, someone looking to cash out won't simply dump it all the way to, say 5000. They will try to get the most for their money, so they'll try to slowly sell at close to the current price, unless there's massive panic for some strange reason

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:08:43
wow, so only 26 days...what was the price? around 6000?
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:16:10
They say 0.1% of accounts but not sure if i believe it. Mine was locked when i didn't have much (about 0.1 btc) and i doubt there wad anything that could have been considered suspicious...finally got it unlocked after 3-4 weeks and i just withdrew it all
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:44:32
Maybe,  but it could still be, most successful scams work by acquiring/partnering with someone that may give it legitimacy

@_date: 2017-11-09 02:30:46
But if you look back 1 month or two, bitcoin rallied like crazy and most alts got stuck...having money in alts the last few weeks wasn't good
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:08:13
I'm sad, i was trading when it got stuck around 800-8400. Managed to sell high and buy low a couple of times, but on the last one I sold at 8400 and then it left me behind...I have no bitcoin :(
good thing I have equivalent of almost two in GBTC shares, but still no actual bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:18:39
Or you can just ask them:)
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:54:49
Fake news, i see 6600 right now :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:54:12
I'm sure coinbase would be happy to expedite it for some PR
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:47:23
That's what happened with Bitcoin cash fork, i think, with people going to alts for hedging...but just a guess
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:55:46
Canadians are closer though, they were at 8000 a few days ago
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:28:36
Talking about fees, i was going to pay my dish network bill with bitcoib, but 0.001 fee killed any idea...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:48:26
Why is the price so high there?
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:55:27
"I’m just speculating but I think it could hit bitcoin too."
Shit, I'm panic-selling all right now
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:43:41
A cc reward is not taxes, but crypto is, so agree with the statement of having to use the cost basis as the price when received and go from there.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:53:15
Yeah, but we can say, here's my 5000 transactions and i say they are right...prove to me they are not
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:52:39
About two weeks ago, i bought a few times and no cash advance...but then out of the blue that changed few days later. Fuck those fees. 
Then coinbase sent an email days later warning of the change on how those are coded...fuck coinbase and fuck banks
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:51:39
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:40:30
Most people won't try to scam in person, and assuming the value of the goods is small, the risk is also small
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:51:31
I'd say no, cost basis is whatever the value was when you received it, just like cashback in a credit card. CC rewards are not taxable because they are "a discount". The problem is that btc is "property" thus triggering a taxable event. Liquidating the btc at the same price would not trigger a cost, because the capital gains are 0, but it would still need to be reported because they said so
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:00:36
Honestly, part of the problem is that most people that used coinbase wanted their respective bcash so they could dump it. The only way it could be done was by having listed for sells/buys, etc...but a lot of people believed that gave bch credibility because coinbase only supported 3 coins before that...it was partially a case of catch 22
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:22:09
yeah, that makes it a lot easier. Make sure you keep good records and it will make your life easier. I didn't for the last couple of years and now I deeply regret it...need to spend a lot of time reconciliating my accounts
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:07:06
banks have been reckless many times..thus the financial crisis...they are ok if they do it, just not if you do it
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:36:12
nobody said they did. Tesla cars have become very popular recently, yet most don't own one either
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:46:11
Whenever you don't sell something (e.g. hodl it forever), then it becomes irrelevant, but using it is like selling it (per the IRS)
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:29:56
You are supposed to be able to show the cost basis of each transaction...a nightmare, i know
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:00
nice, thanks
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:07:28
Ha , i feel ya, go down so my low orders trigger or go up so i can celebrate :D
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:06:08
it wasn't, so I took advantage of that, but then they swithced on me without warning, so I'm very upset. I'm going to fight the charges, as both coinbase and the bank charged me. One side is fine, but not both. fuck them both
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:26:39
That's how it works for stocks as well. Make sure you report your cost basis otherwise IRS assumes your cost basis being $0 and you owe taxes on the full amount. At the of the day your net proceeds may be $10, but the IRS doesn't know unless you tell then
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:22:42
I didn't get anything... did you get closer to 20k than you expected?

thanks!, i forget there's a sub for everything :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:49:13
you just said "Haven't heard of Coinbase charging additional fees"
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:54:13
You are naive if you think they didn't know
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:45:21
There's a lot of people too stupid even for cash...not much we can do
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:11:51
pretty good explanation!
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:15:00
Because coinbase charges (or charged) additional fees to treat it as a purchase. They charged fees on top of the purchase.
They were notified on Jan 23rd of the MCC change yet they did not notify customers until Feb 1st
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:17:58
Does your CPA get creative or you simply miss stuff in taxact? Otherwise, ideally,the numbers should match
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:58:25
agree, it was a reckless move...which paid off, but lucky nonetheless 
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:34:24
If you sleep you can't stare at the chart all night
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:48:19
Yeah, stop losses can be very risky...also, don't forget to set limit buys for very low prices in case there's a big flash crash and you can benefit from it :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:53:02
well, that's good for you. BUT before Jan 23rd, using CC was treated as purchase. But because of the MCC change, now they are treated as cash advanced. Coinbase knew of this change and did NOT notify us for a week. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:36:06
You are not understanding, coinbase did charge additional fees for CC purchases...now, because of the MCC changes, banks also charge their own fee, thus causing double fee charges. I can show you a screenshot if you are still having trouble understanding this
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:16:08

@_date: 2018-02-17 19:42:13
yup, that techcrunch article only links to coinbase blog. Coinbase says they are not to blame...sure.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:49:29
I'd say buy but don't use up all the funds you had to buy, since it may drop even more
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:49:52
Addictive and stressful, that's the problem
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:32:15
how did it go? All cashed out? Hopefully you cashed out before it dropped even more
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:41:32
can you give more detail? are they talking specifically about the coinbase issue?
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:25:47
i like this statement

Supposedly worldpay
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:46:24
This is the email from coinbase. The problem is not the change, the problem is that coinbase took 1 week to notify customers
"Dear Coinbase Customer
We’re writing because you have a credit card on file and want to inform you of a recent change that may increase the cost of purchasing digital currency with a credit card.
Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. The new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional "cash advance" fees. These fees are not charged or collected by Coinbase. These additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement. 
Coinbase does not know whether or not your card issuer collects these fees, nor do we know how much they might collect. As a result, we would strongly suggest switching to a debit card or bank account as your primary payment method. You can do that on the following page:  
We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. 
The Coinbase Team

@_date: 2018-02-05 23:08:42
but to be accurate, you need to provide all transactions, from all exchanges and from all wallets. Also, if you are not new to bitcoin this year, then technically you would need to provide previous years if you held bitcoin before this year so you could report the cost basis of each one...it's a damn nightmare
for stocks, most of the time this is done for you, but not for crypto, even if you use a third-party system like bitcoin.tax

@_date: 2018-02-24 18:37:38
According to the chase rep I just talked to, Coinbase misrepresented themselves to mastercard and visa as digital media and they knew they were in the wrong. You can believe them or not
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:51:27
but the point is that you might never see that 2k again, thus you wilp never buy again?
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:21:44
i woke up the other day (Wednesday?) and saw it at ~3000, quickly went to buy, and put 0.1btc. i then changed it to 0.050 and bought it...first time in a while i timed it right, but unfortunately my buy was small :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:09
I did this. I bought at 10000, then i bought again at 9600, then at 9300, then I sold the first of my kids. Kept buying at 8600, then sold the other two kids, kept buying at 8400...anyone looking for  healthy kidney?

The problem is that Bitmain pretty much has a monopoly, and they know it and they abuse it. They try to rip off their customers. They make the prices so that miners think they can manage to break even in a few months, but that rarely ever happens.
it's too risky and expensive to mine, it's better just to buy BTC
and let's not forget about those shady pools that don't share the transaction fees (and are not very open about it)
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:29:24

i know, I sold "too low" :( oh well
 I'm very confident it will drop to sub-5000 again in the next few days, so i'll set my order to buy back
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:17:01
and then one day it will go to $100k...and will crash all the way to $40k-50k...and the show goes on :)

I've seen the dips and spikes around 3AM CST, cant' tell if it's the Chinese or Koreans or Japanese, but I can bet it's not people in the US (we are all dreaming with our coins)
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:34:27
Now that i think about it, would have given up and covered during one of the crashes, so the bleeding would have stopped long ago :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:31:36
Damn, that's scammy...can you share more details?
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:01:55
true, plus consider all the ICO scams...
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:43:29
During the winter they help heat up your house, so it's a bit better :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:16:55
that's what i was thinking
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:33:27
one mention :) ? still mostly ignored it seems
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:16:28
Huddling our Bitcoin is frowned upon?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:48:32
so if we burn you, we can make it stop?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:33:54
RemindMe! 7 days
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:36:20
Can't you use a banana for reference?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:08:02
Should we all counter by adding new nodes in AWS machines? Surely we can all do.this with a free trial :P

"I'm not going to talk about something i don't know nothing about and because I'm a big liar and nobody would believe me anyway"
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:43:57
kid? i bet he was over 60
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:12:38
But coinbase was notified and did NOT inform the customers
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:41:59
Probably because regulators take their jobs seriously there, while in the US they work for the lobbyists
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:03:59
please share :drool:
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:42:23
yes, here it goes. and they definitely charge separate fees.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:45:23
indeed...have they given a timeframe?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:29:50
That's real Mexican food :) (though can't taste it to give confirmation)
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:55:10
you are not buying everything at one, right? you should consider diving the amount in many chunks so you average your cost
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:43:59
kid? i bet he was over 60
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:59:32
but you can't help if someone steals from you. I think we have all lost coins at some point or another
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:58:56
It's not about investing more, it's about where their assets are allocated
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:54:42
duh, good point,  apparently we can't read
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:13:28
Few people can tell the govt "watch me"...Bezos would be one of them 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:15:46
no, he went to fight Chuck Norris inside  an active Volcano. We hadn't heard of either one since then...until now
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:09:27
Why buy instead of just renting?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:05:11
ok let's see  conservative activists "she must have the baby"
liberal activist "it's her choice and she should not be forced"
conservative activist "she believe in God and we should follow the bible"
liberal activist "you should be able to choose a good if you decide to"
CA "if you are a man you must marry a woman, and viceversa"
LA "you can love and marry whoever you want"
want me to continue??????
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:32:25
By the way, i had made multiple purchases, out of the blue, one day, they started charging the fees...of course i complained and no go...if this lawsuit doesn't cover everyone, maybe I should do small claims
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:53:43
What feedback specifically?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:43:38
kid? i bet he was over 60
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:50:25
That changes things. I reported but i was not in the list (didn't get any forms)
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:16:02
i rember a long time ago i woke up early to a big dip to ~3050USD, i bought instantly...though second guessed it and changed from 0.1btc to 0.050 btc in case in droppes more...never happened ...oh well ...times have changed  (4 weeks? :) )
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:22:51
I think it was my fault... I'd been checking every 5 mins and no change...forgot about the price for a few hours and boom!
You can thank me later
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:06:44
i had already written off hitbtc as a scam
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:49:09
I think that part of the reason is so that it is not stolen that easily
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:51:32
Completely normal. Don't worry. Move on
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:25:13
Yes, but this is different. It's not about getting away from the US...
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:28:35
Taxes are very high,but that's because carifornia gives more to the US than what it receives. Splitting wouldn't change this situation by much though
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:54:52
I use gemini exchange (left coinbase a while ago and not coming back), but you can't use a cars there, only bank transfer or wire
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:27:34
Here's the .gov link
I found many very recent articles, so maybe it hasn't spread out yet
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:47:57
I once formatted my wife's microdf but was able to recover most of the files (pics) with free recovery software...give it a try. Can't remember the name, but google is your friend
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:31:20
price of bitcoin has also been correlated with google searches (multiple threads in the past)...I think that might be a bit more accurate though ;)
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:29:18
He's actually saying the opposite of what you said. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:26:58
I got dinged by the CC transaction fees when coinbase suddenly changed the merchant code ... I'm getting it all back this quarter with the chase freedom 5% CB with paypal (even money transfers)...times 4 :) (...and all the chase UR points i got from CSR and ink. I think the score is about 2-1 in my favor
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:35:41
8 years of Obama did that to fox people muahaha
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:24:33
It's not secession, completely unrelated. It's just splitting up in 3. All 3 would be like any other state
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:49:53
I'm one as well
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:49:12
Did you follow up with the bank?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:37:25
When i contacted them they claimed that it was coinbase that was incorrectly using the wrong merchant code...i couldn't fight it
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:20:09
damn, I should read the fine print...but anyway, it's still a similar situation. I'm not aware if the government (US) has ever shutdown a bank/credit union without regard for the people having money invested there
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:25:48
By many people it's like 10 (well, fine, more than 10, but all of fox viewers)
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:41:49
I still don't understand why the FBI feels like they can just take down a site and give us a big middle finger
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:43:06
I understand when the money "belongs" to the criminals, but when the money belongs to the people...i.e. I'm not aware if the government has ever seized the funds of a bank
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:26:25
thanks, it wasn't that much, around 0.4 btc (I know a ton of people had a lot more), but it still hurts. so now I'm just numb to the fork stuff
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:39:25
This is why I stopped using coinbase a long time ago. They do whatever they want
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:48:31
most would pause for a second, but then...meh, and continue lol
