Is there a limit to the types of computations that can be done?
How is Enigma different from Ethereum?

Both buyers and sellers get to choose the terms of the trade. Both buyers and sellers get to choose the arbitrator.  
Or you can skip the arbitrator altogether if you don't need one (eg. when you are acquainted with the buyer/seller).
You don't have to bail out other people for their bad assessment of counterparty risk.

It's not personal. For a doom cultist, any technology invented after 1800 is BAD.

Gambling is pure luck. That means that no matter what you do, the [expectation value]( of your financial gain is always less or equal than 100%.
In prediction markets, if you have access to information that other participants don't have access to, this expectation value can be *above* 100%. 
That is the crucial difference that differentiate them from gambling. Yes, there is still an element of luck but it's not pure luck.

At this stage, it's probably not ordinary Greek people buying Bitcoin, more like speculators buying Bitcoin in anticipation that there will be a surge in demand in Greece.

Using bitcoin as an escape currency doesn't mean you should put all your savings into bitcoin.  But it doesn't hurt to own a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin, just like it's doesn't hurt to own a few gold coins, and bitcoin is already easier to liquidate than gold.
Not it's not for the average Joe but there is a spectrum of tech and financial savvy and bitcoin has come a long way in terms of useability.

Bitcoin would have seemed like wild science fiction 10 years ago. Bitcoin is almost boring now, compared to stuff like this. At the same time ... we ain't seen nothing yet.
Interesting times.

People with substantial savings *didn't* leave them in the bank. The people you see queuing at the ATMs are generally not in that group.  Many of them don't have any savings at all, they just want to collect their paycheck so they can buy some groceries.

or just don't be a middle man and actually produce something that requires intuition (something that human brains will do better than silicon for many decades still).

"not available" is a term you use if there is a techical glitch, or lack of bandwidth, or maybe a natural disaster.
But if you are perfectly willing and and able to offer a sevice to anyone who is willing to pay for the service, but are prevented by doing so from a bureaucrat who "knows better" what is best for both parties involved, then CENSORSHIP is absolutetly the right term. If anything it is too lenient a term because BULLYING would be the most honest description.

To be fair, I have never seen a *good* German localization. I have seen mediocre ones at best. Most of them sound awkward or stilted. German just doesn't seem to be a very Web-friendly language.
