Too bad it's not shown in Satoshis. Most of the lightning payments will be in Satoshis.

$16.000 end of week

Cost averaged down the last year... Best decision ever!

Not buy it, but keep an eye on Coinbase Earn. You can get some crypto for free and convert them to BTC. Got 35$ in ETH this way!
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:54:56
Yes, but you asked for a few free bucks. Take them and hodl!
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:26:37
Yes please... ��

Scrolled to long down for this! Up!

Because NOBODY can stop this transaction.
Think about it!
But also maybe you fees are chosen too high.

Stacking fiat is one of the "other asset classes" ;-)

Crypto already has 50% over all portfolio since the last runs. So I decided to start investing on other asset classes too.
@_date: 2019-11-07 06:04:44
Listen to me... I have a monthly plan for investing. I picked 33% BTC, 33% ETH and 33% IOTA.
@_date: 2019-11-09 11:20:37
Bought the dip.

There is always a discussion about THE Lightning network, but I don't understand the different implementations? Are they compatible? Which should I use?
@_date: 2019-08-04 14:42:56
And for retail you have lightning right?
Only the transaction to the wallet needs some time.
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:31:16
Do I have to do anything else for receiving these tips? Reading a lot about the Lightning network right now, but still a little bit confused.

Can you please stop posting memes on other days than Friday? Now you have your volatility...

Never tell anyone about the amount of your crypto assets...

One good advice is to read the Cryptofit book of Julian Hosp. No matter if you like him or not, the book is the best and shortest way to get good answers of all things around crypto!

Haha great one! Thanks for sharing!

After sending your transaction to the network, there is nothing you can do.
@_date: 2018-12-27 12:47:11
Is there a fixed format for cryptocurrency addresses like "btc:1qzhdhrj...." for other coins? Like for Ripple or other coins you also need a tag or payment ID.
