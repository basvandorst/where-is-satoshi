Right. Still made by apple. It's a little weird it's a separate download and not bundled in the OS but still pretty awesome

Sending fortified vibes, mate

It should be in the options when you 'Add to home screen'

Never thought being a broke-ass bag-hodler would get me my first ever reddit gold! Thank you, fellow anonymous poor, unfortunate soul!

Maybe a petition to sticky a dynamic chart following the global adoption of the tech would be more appropriate ��
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:40:15
Couldn’t agree more. If more ppl got hard over infrastructure rather than price, the price would presumably be much higher imho.

Uh boom!
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:35:15
Yea! This is exactly what I was looking for, and the idea that terminals could be upgraded for $29 sounds super promising. Can’t help but wonder what the ETA might be 
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:15:45
Doesn't really have anything to do with being upset.  It's irrational to pay attention to idiots on the internet trying to predict something I don't believe most of them even understand. I used to come here for news, but there are other, more balanced places to obtain information. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:17:21
Nearly all investments are speculative by nature. That doesn't mean some information is more or less analytically sound. Ppl running here screaming that the sky is falling with no legitimate rational for why is pretty worthless imo.

Long time holder, first time spender. Makes me realize the amazing utility of BTC, but I imagine a big BOOM will happen when the ‘friction’ of making transactions is reduced. If you’re not really certain on how mining fees, the transaction process, and even submitting a transaction works, it can be a little intimidating, even for someone fairly tech-savvy. I imagine there’s got to be a way devs can get things to a point where making a transaction can be as seem-less/easy as using Applepay/Androidpay. Can anyone share insight on this? Maybe something is already in the works?

Theories are methodical and analytical. This is your opinion. And it’s shit 
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:00:45
This sub has become toxic af. All the speculation is bogus. No one knows where BTC is going. But all this and fuckery is fud-ery is redonkulous. Time to unsub for a while. For those of you with nads I'll see you on the moon.

Keep it up my man. These weak mofos will be crying when the strong hands are waving from the moon.
