I started buying at like $3000, so pretty late, but I made a few lucky trades with some altcoins and made a ton.  Bought 200 ANS/NEO at $3, sold them back to BTC/ETH at $50, then rode the IOTA train from $.80 to $5.50, so I turned less than $1000 into damn near $20,000 over the span of a few months.  I doubt I could get that lucky again, but I'm holding what I have.  Even if BTC sinks to $5k I'm still OK with it but I don't think that will happen.

Kind of needed the money, unfortunately.  Wasn't in the best financial shape back then.  That and I obviously never could have guessed BTC would turn into the behemoth that is has.

I bought 7 bitcoin when they were $13 each, sold them at $100 some and was thoroughly proud of myself.

back a few years ago I bought 7 btc when they were $13 each, around $100 total.  I was playing with the funny internet money.  Sold then when they were around $100 each.  I still kick myself every day for that.  I'm back into it, although in small amounts now.  But I've doubled my investment so far, so I can't complain too much.

I bought 7 when they were $13.  Sold them when they got to $120, I was pretty proud of myself at the time.

Or trading bitcoin for altcoins and staring at bittrex all day

Start bribing politicians with bitcoin instead of cash, problem solved.

It happens with other industries, as well, namely tobacco.  I'm a big pipe and cigar enthusiast, and Mastercard has dropped all of their online tobacconists.  Not sure about physical storefronts.  Visa still seems OK but it's probably a matter of time before they drop tobacco.   This kind of activism is terrible.
