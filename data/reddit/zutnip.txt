I’ve had similar inconsistencies. It would be good to know what you hear back!

Ah fair enough - I didn’t think the power increase would be that sufficient...I thought it would be just the same as leaving a PC on all day.

Mining question: Hope I won’t be shot down for posting this...
I rent an apartment and the electricity bill is included so all gains would be profit. 
I’ve got an old computer sitting in the attic:
Intel® Core™2 Quad Q6600 (4 X 2.40GHz) 1066MHz FSB/8MB Cache
Memory (RAM):
4GB CORSAIR XMS2 800MHz (2x2GB)
Graphics Card:
512MB QUADRO FX1700 PCI Express + 2 x DVI
Power Supply:
450W Quiet Dual Rail PSU + 120mm Case Fan
Processor Cooling:
22dBA TRIPLE COPPER HEATPIPE CPU COOLER
Is it even worth the hassle of setting it up/taking up space? Any idea what likely return might be?
Thanks in advance.

Hardware Wallet
I know this has probably been done to death...I have googled it but I can’t seem to find the answers to all my questions/assumptions.
I’d love someone to answer them...or just point me in the best direction. 
(1) My funds are still on Coinbase. This is a risk as I don’t own my keys. As such I should transfer these to a hard wallet..I.e a Trezor or a Ledger. To do this I should use GDAX as this doesn’t cost anything.
(2) The hardware wallet will come with a 24 word recover phrase...this should be written down and never lost 
(3) The Trezor/Ledger has a Public &amp; a Private key.  What is the difference between these and when should each be used? What difference is this to the generated address by the Ledger each time a transfer is needed?
(4) The Ledger creates a new address each time a transfer is to be made.  Simply paste this into GDAX....send. And that’s all??
(5) If I want to sell bitcoin, what’s the best way? Transfer back to GDAX? How is this done?
Anything else major that I’m missing???
Thanks all!

Has bitcoin undergone institutional investment yet...my understanding is that it hasn’t?....that would suggest we still have a couple of “stages” to go yet.

Ah thanks - I think I mislabelled the post? I think I definitely meant just using Limit.
It’s steps 4 &amp; 5 that I’m most unsure of...are they nothing to worry about? Did I get them correct?
Thanks again!
