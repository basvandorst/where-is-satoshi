FYI, the flag in the thumbnail, that the bitcoin is in front of, is not the normal flag of Japan but a military one used in WW2.  It's used in some places just to represent Japan but a lot of people consider it a terrible reminder of WW2, much like the Nazi flag of Germany. Just wanted to say this since I only learned it last week!

I don't think this is true, because the demand for Bitcoin transactions is not perfectly inelastic. If transactions were practically free again, people would make more of them (since there's less of a financial barrier to making them), and the increased number would fill up even the larger available capacity with Segwit.
Don't get me wrong, this is a great step in the right direction, but it's not going to magically solve the scalability problem by itself.

So, to clearly answer your actual question, each ADDRESS has a corresponding private key. A "bitcoin" is just a number associated with a transaction - it's not really a "thing" like an address is.
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:09:57
Given a private key, you can easily generate the public key (and bitcoin address) from it. Given a bitcoin address, it's impossible to find the private key from it - if not, then the bitcoin system would be broken because anyone could spend anyone else's funds.
So, when you create a wallet, your software first creates a random private key, then derives the public key / address from that. To send bitcoin to your address, all you need is the address itself, but to send bitcoin FROM your address, you need to use your private key to sign the transaction.
It's easy just to make a valid address, but since you can't find the private key for it, coins sent to that address can never be spent. An example is 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE. Any coins sent to that address will remain there forever, unless all the bitcoin crypto is broken.

Uh... actually "at gun point" is one of the only sure-fire ways you *can* steal somebody's bitcoin. You just point a gun at their head and tell them to make the transaction, write down the brain wallet, whatever. Bitcoin is no more immune to this than legacy currency.

A simpler solution to the same problem is to have a backup of your phone wallet on some other device. Then if your phone gets stolen you can transfer the bitcoin out of that wallet as soon as you have access to that backup copy.
Even more powerful is to have your phone wallet also be a brain wallet. Then even if you're traveling or whatever, as soon as you can use a device with a bitcoin client on it, you can send the bitcoin to a safe place. If it's a brain wallet you don't need any data other than what's in your brain.

Well, no, because if you sell BTC you're selling it for near the current market value for what it actually is. This guy sold rare coins for 1000x less than market value.

Be careful to avoid the status quo fallacy when deciding what to do.
Imagine you just found/inherited an equivalent amount of USD (or whatever fiat money) and are considering buying all that BTC with it. It seems like a very different thing to *buy* a huge amount of BTC compared to *not selling*, but they result in the same two outcomes so the decision should be the same in both cases. Treating them differently is the status quo fallacy.

I believe it's 0 for the actual Lightning transaction, since nothing needs to be recorded in the blockchain. But in order to open and close channels you need to pay fees. So the fees are something that can be spread out over many transactions, and the fee per transaction can become arbitrarily small with enough usage.

Look up "vanity bitcoin address". Basically you just brute-force generating addresses until one matches your pattern. More specific patterns (e.g. longer substrings) are more expensive.
There are client-side apps that do this, you can turn off your internet connection for it so you know they're not phoning home with your new private key.

Eh, I see what you're saying, but I don't think it's that misleading of a statement (in terms of what non-technical users should understand).
Any individual miner can go down unexpectedly at any time, and the more total mining power there is, the less of an impact this has on the transaction confirmation delay. Bank websites go offline all the time, but the bitcoin network as a whole will have perfect 100% uptime from now on unless something catestrophic happens. The reason this is possible is because there is a large number of independent miners rather than a single point of failure.
So, although you're certainly correct that validating the transactions takes only some tiny fraction of the computing power being used, it's not misleading to say "a large number of miners keeps transactions being validated smoothly". Bitcoin does have a large number of miners; transactions are validated "smoothly" in the sense of having 100% uptime; and those two facts are related. I think it's fine to gloss over the specific way they're related in this non-technical video.

Also, why is it so hard to receive bitcoin using this? There's a send button but no receive button... why?
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:39:38
Now this has got me thinking. What would be the best way to destroy bitcoins in a public display (as a form of art or protest or whatever)?
You could do it with a physical act of destruction, e.g. burning a paper wallet with the private keys... but unfortunately that only actually works if everyone just trusts you that that's the only copy. If any copy of the private keys exists anywhere else in the world, those bitcoins can still be spent.
On the other hand, bitcoins *can* be permanently destroyed with no trust involved (I could be remembering it wrong but I believe it involves signing a transaction to an OP_RETURN script)... but this is quite boring to watch because it merely involves digitally signing a certain message and broadcasting it over the Internet. There's nothing in flames or getting melted down or smashed.
The only compromise I can think of that takes care of both of these aspects (making a physical spectacle and guaranteeing the funds are unspendable) is smashing Casascius physical bitcoins open to reveal the private keys, and *then* signing "burn these bitcoins please" transactions with them and broadcasting them to the network. It seems fitting that this process has two parts: one to destroy the worldly manifestation of the Casascius coin and another to destroy the underlying cryptographic abstraction.
Perhaps someone could even build a Casascius-coin-destroyer device. Now **that** would be fun to watch.

Currently it's impossible to get US dollars out of mtgox, so although you can trade back and forth between BTC and "USD", they aren't "real" US dollars that you can get into a bank account in a timely manner. Therefore they're worth slightly less than "real" US dollars, so the BTC/USD price is inflated. See 
Others may have a take on the situation, but there's one thing I think we agree on: the "law of one price" only holds in situations where it's possible to take advantage of arbitrage by constantly buying on one exchange and selling on another. If you can't actually move money around between exchanges, this isn't possible, so the "law of one price" can fail.

Great answer. One last thing to clear up: When clients are deciding whether to accept a new block, they verify all the data, including the target recorded in the block header. I assume for 2015 out of every 2016 blocks, that target has to be exactly the same as the previous block's target to be valid, right? But what about for the target-changing block? Does it have to be exactly the same as the client's own calculation of what the new target should be, or is there a small fudge factor?

A legitimate question deserves a helpful answer. One way to do it is open up a margin trading account on bitfinex.com, fund the account (I find funding it with bitcoin to be the most convenient), then after you have converted your funds to dollars, open a short position on bitcoin. The interest rates for bitcoin loans are reasonable, at least compared to the sky-high interest rates on dollar loans. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, you'll probably get extra profit from the interest rate swap (can anyone confirm this part?).
Then price of bitcoin increasing -&gt; you end up with less dollars, price of bitcoin decreasing -&gt; you end up with more dollars. That's what you want, right?

Okay, rather than tell you this is stupid and if you want that ~$0.50 you're better off looking for change under your couch, let's take it as an interesting problem.
The main issue is: what form do you want the USD in? I often use CampBX for trades involving my bank account, but the fee for outgoing ACH transfers is $2, so that kills the idea of getting any deposit from selling 0.002 BTC (even supposing they had no mimimum).
Coinbase informs me that out of the $0.53 proceeds from selling that much bitcoin, the fees would be $0.16. I guess $0.16 isn't **so** bad... but consider that it's about 30%. Are you willing to take a 30% loss just to say that you've done this tiny little transaction? (Unfortunately you can't actually execute this trade because the minimum is 0.1 BTC, but I'm just showing how it wouldn't be a good idea even if there were no minimum.)
No, the correct way to do this, I think, is put that 0.002 BTC in a paper wallet and look for someone who'll buy that paper wallet with some pocket change. Hey, if you're a good enough salesman you might even get a lot **more** than the market price! See if someone will buy the mysterious computer money from you for a dollar. If they have a smartphone you could even show them how to install a bitcoin app and import the bitcoin from the paper wallet (to convince them that it's real).

If they were actually found simultaneously, none of them could have had news of the others or include their hashes. Therefore only one of them could become part of the longest chain and survive.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the bloom filter thing refers to  . Basically, **everyone** has to download full blocks (not just miners / full nodes), so before the max block size can be increased, that has to change. The bloom filter thing is a way for a client to say "I'm only interested in transactions that match this pattern" where the pattern is still a pretty vague thing that doesn't allow outsiders to figure out what addresses the client owns. It allows a lot of irrelevant information from blocks to be thrown out without completely destroying anonymity.

It's not clear from your question whether you understand this or not, so sorry if you already know this: one bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 parts. That's enough for everyone in the world to have many thousands. And in case that isn't enough, a hypothetical future protocol update could divide each of those into some further number of smaller parts. Divisibility isn't an issue.
Another part of your question could be related to mining. Yes, all bitcoin will eventually be mined within a hundred years or so, but that has little to do with the distribution of bitcoin to the world as a global currency. Most people don't obtain bitcoin by mining it, instead they obtain it in exchange for goods or services (or, what's way more common at this point, national fiat currencies).
