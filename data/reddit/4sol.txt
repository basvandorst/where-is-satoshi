You need to review the evidence from his trial because you're wrong.  He tried to have people murdered multiple times and paid for the murders when he was shown what he was told was evidence of them.

The weather is a factor.  It's getting to be nice outside..

Theirs is special because it represents a contribution to the network on their part.  This empowers them and creates a sense of freedom and you are smart enough to know that.  They didn't have to do it just like you don't have to be an asshole.

We haven't hit the curve on moores law for asic miners and we have no idea what they have up their sleeve so let me dream! :)

They have a lobby it must be legitimate.

Since when have you needed an excuse to sleep on my couch?

Forensic tools were used at the time the laptop was seized to prove the integrity of the files.  That evidence was presented at the trial if you bothered to review it.

He's technically correct but he's doing nothing to explain it in a way that helps most people here, which is confusing since his response appears to be an attempt to help.  But he could just be trying to impress us with his knowledge... a certain Lebowski meme comes to mind when I read his submissions.

The drug war is wrong but so is believing Ross is some kind of self sacrificing hero.  We saw with his own words how he tried to have people murdered.

We have actual chat logs, his diary and payments that came from the wallet on his laptop.

Respect isn't the main factor, distribution is.

Make sure you use tor when you legally change your name.

Why did you want to do that?  I'll give you something in return for an honest answer..

I prefer to cover myself in glitter head to toe before I leave the house, that way nobody knows who I am.  
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:03:44
Except the transactions are from his wallet and correlate to the chat logs with the hitman he hired..

Maybe it only mines when it's plugged in and you are incentivized by a reward program when it mines.

Murder charges in Maryland are still pending.  They didn't need to muddle this case with the murder for hire since they had enough to put him away for life anyway. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:44:39
Ross reduced violence like BP reduced the oil spill in the gulf.  It's a lie.  Ross just wanted to get rich and was hooked on the power and he demonstrated he would kill to keep it.

I'm not going to do your work for you, you have to want to know the truth.  I've wasted too much of my time on people who refuse to see it even when it is put before them.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:42:02
Even without the attempted murder they had enough to put him away for life so it makes no sense they would fabricate it and complicate the matter.  You have some fucked up morals if you think murdering even one person is somehow justifiable.
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:55:20
If you only try to kill a few people, that's ok?  Have you even read the court transcripts and looked at the evidence presented?  Based on what you said I don't believe you would internalize it objectively even if you did.

Are there fees on Chinese exchanges?
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:36:28
But that would be inconvenient, the OP probably doesn't want to be inconvenienced in any way.
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:19:42
Are they selling existing miners or pre-orders?
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:24:38
They saved his life and locked him in the closet, lol.

Honey Badger don't care.

Looks good to me, what's the problem?  Marriage is a contract.
