It's also possible that scenario two may reissue withdrawals much faster than support could do manually. Depending on what sanity checks (if any) they had in place, they could have lost a lot of BTC very quickly.

It may be the case that the automated reissues went out faster than the support people could do manually. The rate at which the duplicated withdrawals occurred could have been quite high and in parallel.

As far as I can tell, any time you trade one asset for another, it counts as a disposal for capital gains purposes.
If you bought a painting for £10,000 and then traded it for a sculpture worth £15,000, you have made a gain of £5,000. Now, there are deductions for yearly exemptions, previous losses carried forward etc. There are also certain rules for certain classes of asset (dealing with collections etc), but the recent statement by HMRC seems like they'll be treating cryptocurrencies just like any other currency. So currency rules apply.
So say you bought 1 BTC for £250, then at some later time you bought 100 LTC for 0.2 BTC when bitcoin was trading at £500. Your acquisition costs for 0.2 BTC was £50. You disposed of 0.2 BTC at £500/BTC which is £100. Your gain is £100 - £50 = £50.
Add up all these transactions for the tax year, subtract any allowable deductions and multiply the result by the applicable capital gains rate. That's what you owe the powers that be.^*

Not a bad idea but there's another option.
When signing up for a service with monthly billing, you could sign a series of transactions which include an [nLockTime]( value for each successive month. That way the merchant can only obtain the agreed upon amount after the agreed upon time.

2-of-3 would probably be best. Any two of trader, exchange and third party.
If the exchange goes under, the trader and third party can access funds.  
If the third party disappears, the exchange and trader can access funds.

Not a bitcoin dev but my understanding of the issue is this:
(Note the details are probably wrong, padding transaction elements is probably more likely but for the sake of clarity let's go with the below)
A transaction is a collection of signed inputs and outputs.  
Say you have a transaction like so:  
    input a, input b, input c
    output d  
This hashes to X.  
Rearrange the inputs:  
    input c, input b, input a  
    output d  
This hashes to Y.
The transaction is the same (in both cases, coins from a, b &amp; c are now in d) but the hashes are different. 
Gox's problem is that their business logic depends on the hash not changing. The attacker withdraws from gox. Gox stores the transaction hash in their database. Attacker mutates the transaction (ie same transaction but different hash). Attacker tells gox that his withdrawal failed. Gox sees the hash in their database is not in the blockchain and sends the attacker more btc.
Gox should not base it's business logic on malleable transactions.

They missed their targets. It runs at ~ 1.6TH/s and consumes ~ 2kW of electricity.
A rough approximation of the yield of any given hashrate at any given difficulty for a 25BTC block reward is:  
    yield = hashrate/(1988*difficulty)
So for 1.6TH/s at today's difficulty of 3.13 billion, a Terraminer IV would make 0.257 BTC per day until the next difficulty adjustment ~ 1441 blocks from now.
Determining if it's worth it depends on the rate of growth of difficulty and how soon you can get hold of a miner. I estimate difficulty will continue to grow at ~20% per adjustment for the forseeable future. If you had a Terraminer on hand right now, then it would be worth it. However, Cointerra have sold all batches until June.

The address structure in Electrum should look like this:
    +Main Account
      +Receiving
        +Used
          Old Address
        Address
        Address
      +Change
        Address
        Address
Your old address should be under "Used".

That's assuming they reuse the same inputs. If they didn't reissue the exact same transaction, but created a new one then gox's hot wallet gets hit twice.

Everytime you earn bitcoins, check the value of the bitcoins in GBP. That's income. Pay income tax on it.
Everytime you trade bitcoin for something else (widgets or currencies or whatever) check the GBP value of the transaction, subtract the price you got the bitcoins for and that is a capital gain (or loss). Pay capital gains tax on it.
I'm sure there are tax credits/exemptions for up to some value of capital gains in the UK. You'll probably find more information at [HMRC](

Which legal jurisdiction determines that a particular bitcoin was involved in "some kind of crime"?
If I were an American in, say, New York and I decide to contribute to a "Snowden Fund" and the US government decides funding undesirables is a crime, are those coins forever removed from circulation?  
What if I am a US citizen in South Africa and do the same?  
What if I'm a Dutch citizen in China and do the same?
Whose rules are we playing by?  
How can redlisting be appealed?  
Who has the authority to add outputs to the list?
Are your transaction outputs innocent until proven guilty or innocent until accused?
If bitcoin is to be used as a currency, it should be a legally agnostic unit of account. If the world's various judiciaries want to implement Bitcoin specific legal mechanisms, they should be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, not into it.
Is Bitcoin going to be a currency / fungible token or a tool for the powers-that-be to implement social policies?
