Thanks for your help. I installed version v0.6.2 Beta over the old version and it installed fine BUT, it still isn't catching up with the blockchain and now this message appears:
"WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade or other nodes may need to upgrade."
I tried sending some bitcoin as a test and a red bar appeared across the transaction field and nothing moved:  HELP!

Just to be sure; the .dat file is about 120 KB in size and contains everything I need to regain access to my bitcoins after redownloading the blockchain? And if I open the Bitcoin-QT file and delete everything but the wallet.dat and then run the wallet.dat file, the blockchain will be downloaded correctly and I can go and get some action on r/girlsgonebitcoin?
I owe an apology for the depth of my ignorance, despite loving the technological and social ramifications of bitcoin, I have no clue about anything invented in the last 20 years

More difficulties. I deleted all the files in the directory, ran the wallet.dat and it began loading the blockchain, went 90% of the way and froze again. Then I tried this same process once more (after making some space on my hard drive) and now it won't even begin. I delete all the files and run the wallet.dat and I get an error message about C++ runtime. 
AND NOW, bizarrely, I can't close bitcoin QT at all, not even through task manager. 
Your help would be greatly appreciated, ideas?

I'm having difficulties locating the directory and even the wallet.dat file that is in my computer (yet I have located it before as I have it backed up elsewhere). I shall persevere, if that doesn't work I shall swear and then come and ask a gentleman as knowledgeable and friendly as yourself again. 
Thanks again cowboy, leave an address here and I'll beam a few coins your way if and when I'm out of the woods.

"16 active connections to the Bitcoin Network"
It says the last received block was generated 21 days ago and the number of blocks downloaded hasn't changed since I opened my wallet yesterday morning. I think I have enough disk space. I left my computer powered-up overnight with no other applications running. I'm starting to get concerned now...

Um... it said block 183,100 was generated 21 days ago. I'm having serious difficulties with this thing, I wish I had a rudimentary understanding of computers.

Yes it seems my little old computer has some terminal issues, she doesn't even like visiting web pages anymore the poor thing. She's not long for this world. 
But thank the heavens I managed to run the wallet.dat on another device and seems to be working, exactly as you said. Thank you so much, and enjoy these few tokens of my appreciation.
