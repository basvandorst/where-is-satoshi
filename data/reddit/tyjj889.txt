@_date: 2018-09-12 12:52:23

@_date: 2018-09-09 16:59:52
This should be the face of bitcoin lol.. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:54:51
\^lmfao I was about to move on from this thread and read your comment. This comment is fucking gold, because you know the mentality he has here would be similar to  when it comes to voting

@_date: 2018-09-05 08:19:11
People saying this scam is terrible and obvious... but they wouldn't be doing this if people didn't fall for it soo....
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:19:42
Based on what?
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:19:42
Well I mean in the short term I'm hoping to see bitcoin still slowly climb over the next week and stay stable at 7k. we shall see.
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:39:27
Cool you can bring it inside your house. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:53:23
I would still buy alts, but wait until we finish up the bear trend line that ends around November. Sticking with bitcoin wouldn't be a bad idea, depending how much money you are working with holding just BTC even if it drops you won't get as rekt as some of the alts.
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:18:17
Many people are saying it is going to crash down. This isn't an unpopular opinion
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:27:34
fuck off
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:17:16
Channel the lambos and they shall come
@_date: 2018-09-02 08:53:18
While i usually like when big players feel this way.. now it seems like the opposit is going to happen and we are going to go down. Edit:Mainly because they are pushing this viewpoint of the average joe people.. they could short us hardcore and fuck us all. Loving the positivity and I have my stop losses set just incase we dump, I'm still all for a run up though.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:54:51
I'm waiting for lambo
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:42:40
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:37:21
this is true for people who spend money that they can't afford to lose. If you believe in the space, buy the coins you believe in and move on with life until the next run up happens if it ever does.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:21:58
does this mean lambos are here now
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:12:02
Not bad not bad, keep it up brother!

@_date: 2018-08-28 12:31:02
Well I'm happy that the pump is going on, just hope it is sustainable and that we close the month above 7k 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:03:14

@_date: 2018-08-10 11:35:34
It's annoying reading all these people saying the past performance doesn't mean in the future things will be the same. You guys aren't dropping truth bombs, this shit is exactly like betting on horses and which horse(coin) will win the race. When people bet on horses they look at past performances and the circumstances of each horse that won a race and based on those prior wins/conditions you can bet on a horse(coin) that is likely to perform well in the next race you bet on. Comparing this to crypto, based on past performance, crypto has always climbed and collapsed but eventually recovered, so everyone buying now is betting on that future recovery based on past performances of this space and it's current circumstances. Does that mean it WILL go back up, no, however if you like to take a gamble and look at past trends it seems like it will eventually happen again.  This is all a gamble guys, don't use money that you are afraid to lose, and if you buy a coin, better make damn sure you believe in that coin because holding for the next run up will be really hard without believing in the coins you purchase.
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:23:46
We are all sheep? damn..
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:46:48
The is stomping out my hope in this space... stahpppp btc, i tdidn't think my portfolio could get another beating like this. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:43:15
just a standard of wealth that people want to achieve nothing more.
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:29:25
This matters to people who care to learn about the space, but for people that want to just make money, as long as they can make money without having to deal with all the extra things that come along with it they will.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:41:38
Channel the lambos into your thoughts and tell the world you want lambo and the world will give lambo through the crypto.    Lambos please
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:52:07
7 to be exact, one for everyday.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:01:02
Crypto oh crypto my bags are so large,
thought i was going to be a millionaire but now i'm just poor.
Watch other people who bought early living so large,
my pockets are empty and so is my car garage.
Hopefully one day the moon will be where i sit,
But for now earth is my home can't throw a fit.
One day I will be rich but for now it's just a dream,
I pray that one day my portfolio will be green...
@_date: 2018-08-05 18:49:37

Better emotional rollercoaster than i have ever had with a relationship with a girl. Who needs girls when you have crypto.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:59:24
Also people are acting like everyone and their momma is going to be buying coffee with crypto.. wouldn't worry about the network clogging up for awhile

@_date: 2018-08-23 19:08:51
we didn't need earth either
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:48:14
yup I just now started buying alts and the price fluctuations have not bothered me at all. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:08:03
Coinbase and i would remain there until you get more familiar with the space
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:14:00
meaning you don't get any coins when you buy from robinhood 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:39:17
What do you mean who cares? lol the point is you have the ability to purchase through square cash and it's better than coinbase when it comes to fees. Also the general public will see bitcoin more in their daily lives since square cash is pretty darn popular so this equals more exposure for bitcoin. Drop the pessimistic attitude brah.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:40:48
This video hurts my soul.. lol
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:58:11
just photoshop a lambo over the graphs and that would work well.
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:40:45
Hopefully I can show up to my job in a lambo and then quit my job and say "see you fuckers!" then drive off into the sunset \*Smiles insanely\*

When hopefully more manipulation happens so I can make the gains
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:32:07
I kind of hope this is a thing, gives me more time to accumulate the lambo coins. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:37:22

@_date: 2018-08-23 20:46:33
yup after a certain trend goes on for awhile, things tend to randomly switch up to fuck people over that become dependent on a certain trend to happen.

it will be a miracle when it hits 50k+, doubt you'll be bitching about people being happy there is some positve price movement for once. yeah it's going down, but for a moment, btc gave us a glimmer of hope..
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:31:42

@_date: 2018-06-30 22:43:21
I have traveled the world for singing with my church and had lots of life experiences. After partying a bunch and doing what people around my age do for the past few years I'm starting to get bored with it all. I'm limited by my finances however when it comes to doing things outside of church on my own time.(Travelling) I'm investing in my freedom, I don't even have to retire young, however I'd rather only be working 10 hours a week and have the rest of the week for myself to do whatever I want. I Just want to live life on my terms and not someone else's.. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:32:37
Well I'm a butcher at the moment working a 9-5. It is a solid trade job and I like what I do. However I don't want to be working under someone else for the rest of my life pissing away half my years at work instead of doing what I really want in life..
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:44:34
Yeah I'd rather not be working until until I'm 80, however I'm not 100&amp; saying I wouldn't work at all. I would rather do volunteer work and helping out the community or go around making people's day.. than having to work under someone else..
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:37:46
lol now it's back above 6k..
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:56:07

Fair enough, also crypto will probably do you a lot better than double your money.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:18:26
If you squint your eyes it says,"Hodl verge, lambo guys, lambo.."
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:36:02
That is true if you do freelance work which isn't a walk in the park.. otherwise with a 9-5 you are at the will of who ever is in charged. So I don't agree with you...

I sing part time at my church and it allows me to travel the world, I've been to Europe five times and I'm about to go again next summer. I've also traveled to Canada too and mexico to sing, and then all over the united states. I enjoy singing as part time job and it has allowed for many experiences, however my retail job is just annoying to be at and everyone is miserable there. I would rather just sing part time and then go do whatever the fuck I want to do after that. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:43:58
Going to bang this in my car. HODL YALLLLLLLLLLLL
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:02:57
I'm only 23 at the moment and that is my end goal. I really don't want to be working a 9-5 for the rest of my life. So i'm spending the extra cash I have that would usually go to fast food or games into stocks. I have more than enough things now so I might as well invest money for my future. It shall be a fun ride! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:15:41

@_date: 2018-06-29 23:30:57

Going to catch all the falling knives in the bitch until I bleed out. YOLO
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:48:27
Rpg EXACTLY, money isn't everything, I literally want to invest in stocks just so I don't have to worry as much about money in the long run. I hate working just to pay bills, I'd rather have my bills taken care of and off to do whatever the fuck I want to do after that.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:39:25
Seriously wondering if it'll hit 3k.. if it does my portfolio will be hurting still, however the prices will be amazing at that point. 
Who am i kidding, it'll probably drop even lower after I buy. Note to self, catching falling knives is not a fun hobby
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:29:31

@_date: 2018-06-18 16:07:00
Don't vape, the addiction will get way worse trust me for some people it works fine though..however you go from smelling like cigs and having to go outside to smoke
  to being able to smoke whenever you want and no smell at all. You can literally vape anywhere, i quit smoking cold turkey. It's a bitch the first week but once you get through that things start to get a little better everyday. Eventually you stop thinking about smoking and move on with life. Download the app quit now, it was helpful seeing the amount of time that has passed since my last cig, also tells you the health beneifits your are getting as more and more time passes from your last cig. Also they have a chat room with fellow quitters that you can lean on for support.

I would start to DCA, but I wouldn't be going all in at the moment. That is my current plan..
Not financial advise obviously.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:49:28
coinbase allows you to buy less than $50 btc
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:07:00
I will never understand how people get into that much debt with a credit card.... that shit is insane man.. I have $400 on my credit card I'm paying off at the end of the month. Then all debt is cleared, no sense in getting that deep in debt.. live below your means guys..
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:58:50
Now would be a good time to DCA, however i don't recommend catching fomo anytime soon. These random price spikes aren't holding.. so just pick up a few here and there.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:54:14
See you at 1k

@_date: 2018-11-26 02:22:48
People were saying we would never go below 4k lol
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:39:23

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:40:49
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:50:22
Just DCA, and call it a day.. it may go lower but now is a good time to start accumulating.

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:08:09
I got burned several times, learned a lot of lessons from it though. Pulled out of the space and was waiting to see BTC hit the levels it is at currently. Hopefully it drops more.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:05:53
Been buying back in since 20k, so far it no work to well.(NOTTTTTTTTT) See you guys below 4k, Glad I held out from purchasing crypto. I know it sucks for everyone else,but  I hope BTC hits at or sub 4k then I'll start buying things here and there.

Never give financial advise to anyone.. you can mention investments you are making and why, but don't recommend them take the leap of faith with you. Because if things go south, it's a great way to ruin your relationships

@_date: 2018-11-28 15:10:38
Kaytlyn gets it, everyone was talking about it back in 2013 when it hit 1k, then radio silence after it dropped. Same shit is happening now, everyone was talking about it and now no one is. People only care when crypto goes on bullruns..
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:35:49
bro, you might as well have held anyways and DCA...

you are correct
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:01:22
It's a never ending sale, every purchase of crypto is like buying a new car off the lot. The second you buy crypto it instantly loses value, much like driving a new car off the lot of a dealership.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:12:14
Bitcoin is worth what the last person paid for one on an exchange.. people weren't will to pay 20k per btc so it dropped.

Where can i buy le coinbase?
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:12:41
Nope, because I was busy spending my money on Webcam strippers instead of knowing about BTC. Fapping so far has a pretty good ROI, always see results at the end.

For some reason this doesn't bring any comfort.. seen too many post like this bringing optimism to the space. Going to hold out a little longer before buying. I want people to be hopeless.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:45:32

Awesome, I have been sitting on the sidelines for about 4 months and I'm extremely happy I waited things out. Going to hold out a little longer before jumping in and getting some cheap hot alts

@_date: 2018-11-28 15:08:22
Not only take losses from the market, but now you can lose more better with your depreciating crypto
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:16:48
yuppppppppp, you know what is up.. cars lose something like 25% of it's value right after you drive from the dealership.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:24:26
Just now started to DCA, if we go lower I'm not going to worry about it. Bullish af longterm so if BTC were to go down another 2 or 3k  and that ends up being the bottom it's all good. I would have been buying close or at the bottom while accumulating. Keep in mind I'm only buying a few hundred dollars worth of crypto a month, so I'm not dropping big money into the market haha. Just looking at this as a second chance, not expecting it to for sure go to the moon again however I also don't want to be watching on the sidelines if BTC does moon a two or three years down the road. I will gladly be that idiot that bought crypto that didn't end up going anywhere, than being that idiot that stopped buying when BTC was super cheap and missing out on huge gains. Just got a Ledger nano S and going to store my coins there and buy when I can then move on with life and not obsess over the market.

It will rise when there is more demand for Bitcoin.. there has to be more buyers than sellers.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:54:33
I invest for the dream not the gains
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:42:32
See and a lot of the people I talk to constantly bitch about their shitty jobs and how they hate working a 9-5 and I try to talk to them about crypto or hell even traditional stocks(weed stocks ;D ) and they would rather just continue to complain about their situation. I'm trying to set myself up where I can be independent and not have to slave away at a job just to cover bills. I'm working an extra side job to generate more money to invest in stocks/crypto because I want to bust ass now while I still am young and get in as many investments as I can while I still can afford to.  Crypto may burn me hardcore and it'll hurt my soul that it didn't workout for me even with all the effort I have put into staying up to date with what is going on in the market. However I'll have my peace knowing that I took a shot and missed instead of never taking a shot.  Then it is on the next thing that I feel will improve my income. Best of luck in this market to you sir, and may the gains be with you :D
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:51:10

Well I am waiting for my paycheck, job owes me backpay for a month and a half of work. I'm going to be pissed off if it still hasn't gone through this week. Also it sucks when things dump so that is why people act like the world is ending, it is people's way of reacting to the market. So i don't get where the attitude is coming from.
@_date: 2018-07-01 23:10:53
I'm a meat manager at my job and understand the process of moving up in positions.. I got there from being a try hard while no one else cared to move up in the job and wanted to stay stagnant.  All I want in life is to be self sufficient and make enough money where I can live comfortably and have a few toys here and there.  I absolutely loathe people who complain about their job and situation and YET don't do shit to change it. We live in a society full of people who just want to bitch and bitch and bitch about their situation. The second you start listing off things that they can do to change their situation they soon switch to someone else who will just listen and agree with their bitching. I'm the type of person that gives a job 110&amp; no matter what I'm doing, if i'm cleaning toilets for god sake that toilet is going to be the cleanest toilet in the world. I'm exercising all avenues of making more money reaching my goals, whether it be moving up in the cooperate world like being a store manager, or making some solid money off of stocks and trading and other ventures too. Crypto isn't the answer to my goals, however I view it as another piece to the puzzle. I get paid more for what I do and it took 5 years of grinding to reach where I'm at and still want to be doing something else with my time. I don't want to spend my life working, even if it is something I enjoy doing, I want to be doing it on MY own terms. Best of luck to you in life, just remember life isn't about working all the damn time.. I respect people's hustles, and i'm going to stay on my grind, but the second I see an out that gives me freedom to spend my time when and how I want to, i'm  getting the fuck out.

yup think about all the people that thought they screwed up their timing in early 2017 with buying coins. if they all held and didn't touch their coins they all would have ended up ahead at the end of the day.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:58:39

Edit: Nvm I just checked the market, you really think it's going that low?  Wonder how long until that happens.. man there is much crypto I need to buy and much weed stocks to buy and not a whole lot of money to go around. Going to have to buy what I can and be happy with it haha

I'm not telling people how much i'm holding, nor which coins I buy. Mainly just asking if they are familiar with the market and let them know about some things happening in the market. Surface level stuff honestly, most people lose me after saying bitcoin just wish there were other people like me locally that would enjoy chatting about different stuff happening in the space. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:10:14
Well set a price you will be happy with and call it a day. Btc could go to nothing and then you won't have any money, you also won't know where crypto will be 20 years from now.  
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:05:06
ermmmm no thanks
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:26:04
if btc doesn't recover at least i'll be able to look back at these tits as a reminder about crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:20:38

@_date: 2018-07-25 02:02:51
Go out in public and scream in everyone's face that they are missing out on massive gains. Once everyone ignores you, then cry for them because of the future gains that will take hold of you. As you cross into the promise land and everyone else is begging for a chance to come with you, tell them I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO BUY AND YOU DIDN'T, EAT MY BAGS BOYS.

I have the same view point, while a run up this year would be nice, i'd rather it take a little longer lol.
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:51:03

@_date: 2018-07-24 12:57:05
I would just lose that attitude considering last year it was a joke for btc to hit about 5k. Suspend disbelief fot a bit and entertain the idea that we may damn well have a historical bullrun.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:27:35
I want the funds available asap so when I feel the time is right I can go ahead and buy without much issue.

yup, not saying it is for sure going to happen.. but the way things are lining up at least some money in the market would be worth while.. best of luck :D
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:51:20
can the bull run wait until I get my back pay??
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:19:19
All I want to know is.... will there be lambos?
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:21:49
I feel it could be that.. :\\ shall be interesting
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:48:16
Holy shit, she is lucky as hell.. No one knows how much I'm holding or anything like that. I just talk about things going on in the crypto space or let them know that I'm willing to give a hand in explaining how to get coins if they ever become interested.

It's about lambos
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:14:09
Exactly, but the mainstream people will. LOL You are saying fuck the thing that allows the average joe to purchase bitcoin with little to no effort. Robinhood hosting crypto is a blessing
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:28:43
I KNOW THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:50:09
There is interest in crypto currency for sure, but the general public doesn't care enough about it to go into more details about it outside of surface level information and some don't even have that.  I may look into some groups, thanks for mentioning that going to see if there is anything local.
@_date: 2018-07-15 01:04:54
because lambo
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:15:10
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:36:42
just sell some coins to guarantee profits or if you have life changing money already cash some of that out. I know if I make enough to make me financially set for the next 5 years I'm going to cash a little under half of it out. Pay off my debts and not worry about bills for awhile which would be nice.

@_date: 2018-07-04 09:26:37
You are really dropping some facts man.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:47:32
People want it because it makes it easier  for big dollar people to dabble in the market without having to know about wallets and private keys and the details of crypto. This makes it easier for the nontech person to get involved. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:31:53

Supply and demand? Also you don't know what the future holds.. while i agree that not everyone who has 1 bitcoin will be a billionaire i do believe that they will still do well with owning one. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:10:58
The very people you are insulting are the ones who will give you gains. Nudge them along and help them understand enough to buy your bags instead of just insulting them.

Literally what happened to me last bullrun. If I just held my shit I would have been up a good amount of money but kept being impatient.. then jumped to coin to coin constantly getting dumped on until eventually just breaking even. next bullrun I'm just going to keep my positions.. hodl..
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:06:08
these post are getting really old. But basically all i could say is expect any money you put in as gone. Don't expect to become a millionaire over night. also take profits don't get greedy.

I'm trying to create new losses in the market and so far I'm doing extremely well. All my trades I make help me achieve my goal more and more. First thing though is I need BTC to 100k so I can get to creating things for the crypto space thing.
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:57:37
they perma hodling now

@_date: 2018-12-15 04:02:27
can't wait for the real dip to begin after 3k support drops. That'll test a lot of people's faith in the market

@_date: 2018-12-12 12:13:09
Because there are less buyers than sellers
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:14:21
Well just hold some anyways, if it goes no where, then fuck it. However if it does go somewhere you'll be happy to at least have some skin in the game. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:14:38
lmfao, you should tell them to just buy BTC and fuck school, because you won't need school with all the GUARANTEED gains you are going to get.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:49:32
Honestly I doubt people will be interesting in crypto until Bitcoin hits 10k then they'll sort of watch it and assume it'll go back down. 15k hits more people will be interested, a few may buy but the majority will assume it'll go back down. We hit 20k and surpass it, more People will start buying in and the majority will be paying attention. 21k+ who the hell knows, we may see the mother of all pumps.. Trying to plan my exit strategy now so when the time comes I'm not making impulsive trades, and I have a plan I will stick to.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:43:13
I'm so relaxed with my 100% losses on the crypto holdings i have. can't wait to lose more.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:19:48
we should make a fighting ring for them, winner takes all, then we can bet on who will win with augur!   lulz, I get what you mean but at the end of the day everyone in the world is so self centered that they could careless about someone else in need. It's all about me myself and I.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:52:24
Kind of wish the person that hacked the account started posting things like he is going to dump all his coins on an upcoming date or some shit just to cause massive fear in the market.

Honestly this is what is going through my mind right now..

It is doing things now
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:31:54
I thought there would be more time for me to buy around then.. then assumed btc would drop off after the run to 4k... then assumed again it would drop after 5k and now here we are.. Not exactly getting, " FOMO GO ALL IN" but I'm taking up some position here and there, I will be buying regularly now no matter the price action.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:16:38

@_date: 2018-12-01 18:25:54
You need to understand that no one cares about bitcoin and the tech behind it in the general masses. They will use it if it makes their life easier, otherwise they will stick to their old ways. The focus should be on the space being more user friendly.. to even have a little understanding of the space still takes hours to read about and set up for the average joe and those people don't care enough to spend time learning about some crypto mumbo jumbo magic money. Crypto will have to act seamless with our lives before it is adopted to the masses.. if people have to go out of their way to use it they damn sure won't when we already have a working monetary system in place.

I lost around $500, mainly from attempting day trading and losing my ass seconds after a trade, plus fees. I didn't go balls deep in crypto like a lot of people. So a $500 loss aint bad in my book

oh baby it's cold outside
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:06:02
personally I'm going for alt coins hard core. I would like to have at least .5 btc though maybe a whole one.  just think my ROI will be better with alts than btc. I may have above 1 BTC value in alts though
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:04:48
I'l be greedy when btc hits 2k or sub 2k. Market shows no signs of going up and I don't want to catch falling knives. I would rather miss the bottom and by a little higher in the reversal than continue to catching falling knvies
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:25:31

@_date: 2018-12-02 12:17:40
meaning your average joe on the street does not care about Bitcoin or crypto in general, they for sure don't care about the tech side of things. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:53:43
mehhhh, take me for all I have Binance, I honestly wouldn't care if I got blocked
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:12:11

@_date: 2018-12-03 05:13:37

@_date: 2018-12-06 18:39:25
No wonder Santa isn't bringing me gifts this year.. \*evil laugh\* MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAA
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:43:24
Is it bad that I hope this happens? and it stays like this for a long time ? :\\
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:55:45
Every time I hear old farts talk about Bitcoin like they understand it I get the urge to rub nutella on my nipples and call myself the chocolate god.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:25:20
short lived but that was fun
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:40:35
hodl for guaranteed losses
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:42:34
The hodler side should be, "SELL, NO DON'T SELL, OH GOD WHY DIDN"T I SELL,shewwwyy okay things are fine, FUCKING SELL SELL SELL."
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:48:48
only if you are waiting on the side like me. Coworker just bought a whole btc yesterday.. told him to wait, hopefully we don't drop too much.. but also hopefully we drop a lot more... got lots of crypto me want to buy for cheap.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:07:27
Damn booiii you do da good research 
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:09:30
Not watching
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:37:47
Well that'll depend.. because it may turn into, you should have spent more many than you could. LAMBO BABBYYYYYYY
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:45:08
I'm actually pretty skinny and workout 4 times a week, however I'm not going to deny that eating the fast food is still extremely unhealthy.  Plus not reallya lot of fast food, just 3 times a week lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:11:25
Well you could make that in a day with crypto or lose 40% in a day lol. Sooooo i wouldn't use money you can't lose into this market
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:03:18
I hope it happens, i'll be buying that shit up
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:51:00
Well you must have bought in early unlike me. Lol 1000x gains plox
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:53:25
lmfao, much wow, I'm going to wait for the shit to completely sink, then I'll hop on.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:28:53
just depresses me when I was fully aware of btc back then but didn't care enough to look past the naysayers and do my own research... UGHHHHHH
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:01:57
a future bullrun, in like 4 or 5 years
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:36:37
institutional investor, big money,wall street, all these buzz words have cost many new traders their shirts by blindly believing in the buzz words. All there needs to be is more buyers than sellers for BTC to go up, so all these buzzwords can go fuck themselves.  If people still haven't learned that these buzzwords are only to prop the market up over the past year then enjoy more losses on the way.   I won't be buying until we fall below 3k and even then I will only dca with small amounts of money. Best of luck people, just make sure you understand no one has your best interest in mind, it's dog eats dog in the market and you need to cover your  own ass.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:17:18
Yup, just gotta wait 10 or 20 years
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:06:59
I just want alts, Going to try and hold at least .5 btc just in case I get fisted in my other investments.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:11:09
Cca means gay
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:20:14
Hopefully, a lot those people's bags are pretty brutal to be holding.  Not buying shit until btc break down to around 2k or a reversal starts to happen. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:26:51
Exactly just say, hey i'm buying btc now. *yay*.....
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:15:57
That would be cool, i would buy a bunch even if it doesn't go anywhere and brag that i once had a shit ton of btc before the bubble burst. Then tell some long winded story about how i couldn't find my wallet information in time to sell. Weird flex i know. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:33:18
 \*sighs\*
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:22:11
I have nothing to say.. lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:28:07
Anyone know of any good platforms for keeping up to date with gains and losses for taxes 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:54:03
Yup now i know how to act if there is another bullrun, I will at least lock in some profits and try not to get greedy.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:08:19
hahahahah you are right
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:42:21
probably because this shit dropping like a brick
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:19:31
dank, me likeeeee
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:34:20
fair enough, but nothing is for sure going to happen
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:59:37
I feel the same way, got in around that time too, but ended up making a bunch of stupid decisions on the way up and didn't really come that far ahead in gains. Then got rekt on the downtrend, now I'm at least better prepared for the next possible bull run if it does happen again.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:51:05
I want to create my own btc, when can I????
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:37:13
I know, but would have been nice to have bought back then and possibly been a millionaire now haha. Not saying I would have for sure held back then, but I wish I was buying at least 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:42:37
It'll be the price it will be with the price in the price.     Who knows or cares? Just accumulate and see where things go, if all goes to hell, well at least you can say you were apart of the fun and learned a lot from this market. I'm no longer looking at the market anymore, just going to collect coins I like and DCA down. Keep in mind I'm just now starting to DCA and feel like many others we are close to the bottom. I welcome 1k btc with WIDE open arms &lt;3
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:57:30
RIP Bitcoin you will be missed......
\*two to three years later\*
LAMBO MOON, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS PUMP BTC TO ATH. 1 million dollar lambo Bitcoin.
\*starts daydreaming\*    sigh....
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:13:08
TOO MUCH FEELS... I'm fighting tears... :)
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:57:51
I just started buying around 4k, soooo no.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:56:57
May the losses be with you. Merry christmas
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:06:56
Yuppppp, stopped talking about crypto to everyone now. They'll be coming back if bitcoin moons, and I'll be saying woulda coulda shoulda. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:03:56
win dumppppp
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:52:33
 Honestly I doubt people will be interesting in crypto until Bitcoin hits 10k then they'll sort of watch it and assume it'll go back down. 15k hits more people will be interested, a few may buy but the majority will assume it'll go back down. We hit 20k and surpass it, more People will start buying in and the majority will be paying attention. 21k+ who the hell knows, we may see the mother of all pumps.. Trying to plan my exit strategy now so when the time comes I'm not making impulsive trades, and I have a plan I will stick to.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:53:20
Well I'm not blind, so how can I blindly support Bitcoin? This dude is an idiot... \*sheesh\*
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:08:00
Hey at least you are investing what you can afford and that is extremely impressive. Most people are recklessly investing in the space with money they can't lose.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:45:34
cheer it on, make everyone else fold their cards so we can get some cheap hot alts and BTC on the low low
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:48:56
All i care about is lambos and bitches, come ON BITCOIN. I want easy pussy for life, when you gonna come through??
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:10:14
Not surprised lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:33:31
oh it's been a bull market this whole time? :0
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:10:28
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:13:14
!remember one year
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:26:33
pleaseeeee go sub 3k and make this market bleed!
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:28:15
zoom out and see the future, a world where all the crypto hold hands together and bring this world to the future of block chain.  Hodl le hodl hodl, hodl, ho hodl hodl. Amen
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:44:48
much deep 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:09:53
same! no shame in that man, buy what you can afford
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:23:21
lmfao, if you hold it for a longtime, however alt coins is a different story. diversify y'all
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:43:36
Dank thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:43:53
well I'm going to hodl myself then since no one wants me hodling crypto
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:37:48
This should be the theme for crypto period. lol [1. buy]( crypto 2.??????? 3.profit  
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:07:51
give it a few days.. we will break through..
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:38:24
what a blue ball..
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:45:04
I'm treating it as a gamble lol, I want to stock the fuck up on some  super cheap alt coins I feel will do well. That way if even just 1 pops off, I'll be doing damn well. This market is pure speculation, and I'm more into investing in  traditional stocks. I look at it this way, if I'm buying crypto might as well take a lot of long shots and hope one lands  than play it 100% with BTC.  Go big or go home baby!!!! best of luck in the market.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:11:28
hindsight will make anything sting, no one saw 20k btc happening. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:43:57
WE MADE HISTORY BOIIIISSSS, ESKETIIITTTTT. MOON LAMBO!!!! 
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:17:17
Because then we can't have someone in the middle to manipulate people.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:10:15
Since i just started buy, this is my sentiment currently. However I had no issue selling earlier this year and waiting things out lol
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:00:06
Yeah right...
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:00:18
When lambo?? we need to make a lambo boy daily thread. Bring back the hype for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:35:42
Imagine the alt gainz
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:51:56
just signed up, thanks. I'm not heavily invested in the space, but I want to go ahead and start tracking this stuff now that way it won't be a headache later on when I take profits
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:44:39
how low can she go? 
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:33:04
No fomo for me yet, but I'm taking on positions now lol..
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:49:53
I heard it could make you rich, pockets looking a little empty now..
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:19:39
Hahahaha omg this is funny as hell. I love it xD
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:29:03
It could be worth $1 and still function the same. The biggest thing is supply and demand that is why the price goes up a lot
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:16:25
well if he is wrong oh well, if not, WOOOO HOOO MOTHA FUCKA I"M RICH
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:01:25

@_date: 2018-12-10 17:27:00
