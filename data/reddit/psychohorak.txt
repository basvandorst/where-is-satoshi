Could you please elaborate on why you think taxes are consented to? I don't consent to taxes, but have no choice but to pay them.

No it isn't. Where should I move to? There is nowhere (realistic) I can go to escape the burden of paying taxes. 
Not to mention me being born within arbitrary borders of a self-proclaimed nation should not account to consent.

You are out of your mind.

Are you out of your mind? What money do you expect me to live on?
Putting a gun to someone's head and telling them that to live you have to pay taxes is not what consent means.

Those places have less tax. This isn't a conversation about where the tax burden is the smallest, but whether or not the concept of paying taxes is consensual. And as much as some people try to twist it, it certainly isn't.

Coinbase says that SEPA transfers (within the EU) should only take a couple of days. I'm verifying my bank there - anyone know if those 2-3 days are actually true? Want to buy before the fork.

Is there anything to stop it from happening again? Genuinely curious.

How low the dip will be is the real question. Don't think we'll go under 7k before rise starts again. **hodl**

Alright, but I'll be able to transfer those keys to a hardware wallet at any point if I so choose? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:33:36
Same question as above: I'll be able to do that whenever I want using the keys I get from Coinbase correct?

Brilliant, thanks for the help!

How significant do you think the affect will be? Below 6k?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:54:43
And the math behind deciding the B2X premium was $2.5k?

Why shouldn't I sell now and then buy back once we drop again. Genuine question, new to all of this. 
I understand its hard to predict but if an attack is incoming we can assume the price will drop and then rebound again as it did today, no?
