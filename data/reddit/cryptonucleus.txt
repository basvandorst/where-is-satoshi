That's how I understand it too. You don't pay capital gains tax unless you convert back to dollars. This is exactly what I want clarity on (as it affects the future of bitcoin).

Is that reply really necessary?

We had a similar article here a week ago that only got 6 upvotes pointing to the zerohedge site, but this article goes into much more detail. It is absolutely outrageous to think that a we have to pay a bank to store our money, they then gamble on the derivatives market, and if they fail, they can legally take your money. It is the worst form of daylight robbery.
What's worse is that we have data to suggest that if you let the TBTF banks fail, like they did in Iceland, the economy would recover.

Wait? "users that are trying to sell every now and then some bitcoins" Really? AFAIK you only require a licence when you receive money from person A and then transmit it to person B. In other words 3 parties were involved. A sender, an intermediary (the exchange) and a receiver. 
If I send money in my personal capacity to my friend or an online shop, there is no third party involved. 
If it applies to personal transactions, yes, then I fully agree - it is 100% BS

I'm pretty sure there must be minimum limits on this. Basically it boils down to: if I stay in the US and exchange my PS3 for my friend's Xbox, my friend and I have to work out the difference in price and someone has to pay tax on that transaction. That must be an absolute nightmare for the gov to manage!
This is exactly what all bitcoin transactions will become in the US. Because instead of taking my asset (the PS3) I now offer another asset of mine (my bitcoins) in exchange for my friends Xbox. It is the exact same thing.

Thank you, that part I understand. In our country we are also taxed on lottery winnings and things like that. I'm more interested in the law regarding asset-to-asset exchanges. 
As a further example: I read about a guy who exchanged things on craigslist. He started with a paperclip, and "uptraded" to a house. He would exchange a $0.01 paperclip for a $0.50 pen (I'm just guessing those numbers for this example) and he kept trading until he had a house.
Refs: 
This happened in Canada, lets presume the same thing happened in the US. Was he supposed to pay "capital gains tax" on the value between the paperclip and the house?

Taken from one of his scam pages coinstand.com (now dead but found this on his twitter feed):


So it's **invitation only** but already this brand new site had **millions** of products??? *Just like paycoin had millions of mechants*. 
Oh and the best part was that coinstand site of his also listed the realtime price of bitcoin, and right next to it, it had paycoin at $20. If the site's internal systems calculated the paycoin price at $20, there would have been a huge price discrepancy on each product

When I send you say 0.5BTC I don't really send it to you. The transaction is recorded on EVERY computer running the full bitcoin software. My computer sends the transaction to the next closest bitcoin computer, and that one sends the transaction to it's next peer, and slowly the transaction is replicated across the globe. But I never send the money directly to you. It goes everywhere.
So in effect when you install bitcoin on your computer you have every single bitcoin right there on your computer. 
Your private key is just like a normal key. It allows you to unlock some of the bitcoin you have among the 13million bitcoins stored on your pc. Your key tells the bitcoin system "That 0.5BTC belongs to this user". 
This also means that you can travel anywhere in the world with your private key (ie not your full wallet), and you can unlock your own bitcoin on ANY bitcoin node anywhere in the world. Now add this brain wallet system mentioned here, and you don't even need a USB drive. Your brain now stores *access* to your own coins. 
TL;DR: Your bitcoin is everywhere on every computer, only your own key can unlock the movement of your BTC

That was my very first thought as well. Would appreciate if someone in the know could explain this.

Don't knock the OP. He's got a point and I feel exactly the same way.
I've been saying this long before bitcoin came along. As I grew up I remember how at least once a month I heard on the news how "the savings rate of the country is too low". And I always thought to myself "Really... but you give us no incentive to save". Here savings get 2% p/a interest, while the credit card companies charge anywhere between 18% and 32% p/a on debt. It's just crazy.
Why would I put away money if it just doesn't serve me in any way. 
Like the OP, I also started seriously saving since bitcoin came along. We cannot be the only ones and it is a testiment that the Paul Krugmans of the world have it all wrong. Deflationary economy is NOT a bad thing. If you need something right now, you are going to buy it, deflationary economy or not. Need bread? Yep, you're going to buy that in a deflationary economy. If you need a cellphone, you buy it now and you don't worry if that same phone might be cheaper next month. We've been doing this all along, esp in the IT industry. 
Thank you OP, I agree with you, bitcoin is great for savings.

But the hardware is decentralised. So it doesn't really matter where the data is, it is everywhere. 
And no that's not what I'm implying.

I think everyone here understands that there will be no official reset. Someone "high ranking" official won't announce "Hey guys, yea, umm, there's too much debt so we are just going to hit the reset button and forgive all your debts". 
Sadly, it will work the other way around. Here's a summary of the (centuries old) scam:
1. Create currency
2. Position currency as world reserve (thereby giving it a support pillar to stand on)
3. Use currency to create trillions upon trillions of debt
4. Crash currency to wipe out debt. 
And since ever dollar is created from an IOU with interest, it is a mathamatically impossiblity to pay back that debt. They only way out is a reset. 
So no, the reset is coming - it just won't be called a "reset"

Downvoted for that horrible "Start Mining" ad that comes up on every page of the site. On Firefox 37 for Android that thing keeps moving to below the page fold, making it impossible to close the ad. 
I hope the owner of that site sees this and I hope he realise that his stupid ad is blocking him from getting any real traction in the bitcoin community.

From the article
"The system also rates users based on their Bitrating – a trust score – achieved thanks to an algorithm which aggregates information from the users' social media profile" 
That's all fine and well but a TRUE rating system would have used the blockchain to store ratings data. I don't like the idea of using centralized companies where these ratings can be manipluated (ie, a person creates 500 linked in accounts for the purpuse of making other profiles seem legit). 
A TRUE rating system would use ONLY the blockchain to store ratings information. Everyone talks about how the blockchain "can forever prove that a piece of information is what it is". A rating system in the blockchain would be the perfect fit. 
Every person (if they choose to partake in the rating system) would then have a rating on the blockchain using the notes field: something like
The exact details aren't that important, the point is this stuff belongs on the blockchain, and every person can, if they want, have a ***commercial reputation and rating on the blockchain*** 
Bitcoin is also great because the blockchain can prove that 2 parties sent money to each other.

Quote from article " Under deflation everyone benefits from waiting and aggregate demand thus collapses (penalising us all)."
We have been taking part in a deflationary market section for more than 20 years. If you bought a PC in 1992, you got a 386, if you waited 6 months, you received a 486 for the same money. Did we all stop buying PC's just because we all knew you could get a better PC 6 months later?
In a deflationary economy, the only thing that will happen is that people will stop buying "nice-to-haves". People will start to instinctivly understand the difference between wants vs. needs instead of having post-it notes splattered all over the place, reminding them of this fact (my friend actually did this).
*If I need a bread, I'm going to buy a bread because I'm hungry now. I'm not going to wait 6 months for bread's price to fall*
If my refrigirator breaks beyond repair, I'm going to buy a new one in 15 minutes flat... I'm not going to wait 1 year for the price to fall and then buy a new one.
The same goes for my TV, my bed, my cellphone, my car, my house, my furniture, my computer screens, my microwave, my cutlery, my clothes. 
So this entire argument that the economy will collapse if we have deflation is null and void. 
The only true issue I see here, as pointed out by the article is this: "Assuming there is a time lag between ordering raw materials and shipping the final product to market, deflation means that firms buy their inputs when average prices were higher compared to their level at the time of shipping the final product."
That seems to be a valid point, but my question is, how did the PC industry deal with this? They had to deal with that exact same problem for 20 years. 
I'm not saying deflation is the answer, I just don't think the sky is going to fall if we have a deflationary economy like bitcoin. I'm still going to actively take part in the economy in the same way I've been buying computers every 2 to 4 years for the last 15 years.

If you don't have telegram yet, read this.
I completely deleted Whatsapp on 1 Jan 2015 and have only been using Telegram since then. It is awesome. You even get a fully functional desktop client for Mac/Windows/Linux. I'm using the linux versoin and it's just so easy to respond to messages while you're working. 
Quick tip if you install this (this wasn't clear to me at first)
Telegram has 2 modes - normal "whatsapp" mode where your chats are stored in the cloud. This is useful because it will sync your chats across devices. Perfect for everyday chats. 
Then there is a secure mode. This isn't stored in the cloud and will create point to point encryption with the other end. What's really great about this is that you can change the destruction of messages on the fly. For example: if I send passwords to collegues, I set the timer for 1 hour. Then if we discuss sensitive company accounts I set it to 1 day (so that they can refer back to it). 
Oh... and telegram allows you to send documents. I can now send excel spreadsheets to my accountant :)

Oh... I just figured out how to sidestep the point "deflation means that firms buy their inputs when average prices were higher compared to their level at the time of shipping the final product"
One word: contracts: If I'm a manufacturer, I go to the wholesaler and sign a contract, stating that in 1 month I will produce 1000 washing machines. The wholesaler then agrees to buy 1000 washing machines at 1.5BTC each. 
Bam! Problem solved and profit for everyone!
I'm a complete idiot when it comes to economics, but I'm starting to see that there is a big difference between a "deflationary money system" and a "deflationary economy". I don't think a deflationary money system equals a complete deflationary economy, because just the fact that we as a human race muliply like bunnies (creating more demand) creates its own inflation.
