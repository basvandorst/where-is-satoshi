Cool!  Hey, it is unclear if your "report a bug" feature on the website is working.  I sent a couple of bug reports, but did not received any "comment received" message or email.

I have been on online poker pro for the last 7 years from the US.  Pretty annoyed at the current state of the industry.  I will try you out Infiniti Poker.

Hey thanks!  
I guess my last question wasn't addressed in that AMA.  In the AMA you say that the BTC that are deposited are put into cold storage, while the players proceed to play in USD.  As the site owner / operator, aren't you taking on quite a lot of currency risk?  If Bitcoin happened to crash significantly, how will you cover players' balances that wish to now cash out their USD (that have not depreciated significantly) via Bitcoin?

I can't add chips at a play money table.  I click max buy-in but table balance still reads $0.00

I have a question though.  Is the front polished to a high-contrast sheen?

Wow, you guys did act fast!  Also...

I have many questions... please bear with me.
* How are players' account balances held?  In segregated accounts or pooled?  In USD or BTC?  If BTC, in cold storage?
* What currency conversion rate do you use at the time of deposit / withdrawal (Bitstamp / mt gox / etc)?
* Do you convert BTC to USD instantly on your end after a BTC deposit is made, via a service like Bitpay?
* If you do not convert instantly to USD, would you be in trouble of covering players account balances if for instance, bitcoin crashed significantly and suddenly many players wished to cash out?
