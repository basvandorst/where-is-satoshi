If you're in it for the long run (10 to 20 years) does it matter too much which price you buy into it today ?

as far as i know, you'll have to leave your Bitcoin Core wallet to finish syncing and then you'll have access to it.

Well its not... but at the same time we're seeing unprecedented load on the BTC network with a high number of transactions. Fees have gone up to over $50 at times. 
Give it time, once holidays are over the network will settle down and fees with it. Until then dont use your BTC for small paymemts.

You have two options to get BTC with $50, Buy mining power from a cloud mining site which many believe is a scam, or buy the BTC directly from an exchange. 
Firstly check the exchanges in your country, their fees, trading conditions, how long they have been going for... Nothing worst than signing up on a site to find out they charge like 5% in fees and only been running for under a year. 
2nd Never put any money into Bitcoin that you need. This is a long term investment, Putting in $1000 hoping to get out $5000 in six months is a gamble, and will likely get you burned.

Thats part of the plan, to pull resources on the net that explain the different aspects behins Bitcoin quite well and use those. Stay away from Crypto Gaints that pull an agenda. Though a lot of my work will be done with limited connectivity aimed at those that do not fully embrace technology, so I may even have to do an infograph.
