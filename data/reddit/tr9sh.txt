They probably depend on some mutual libraries but the bug in question is only affecting GnuTLS. If you are interested in bugs that are affecting your specific version of OpenSSL you can always check  but most of them are probabl already fixed upstream.

On an additional note: ff you want to avoid specific libraries in your programs you can always check them with the program `ldd`, e.g.
    
     $ ldd `which bitcoin-qt`
        [...]
    	libssl.so.1.0.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f5c94c72000)
    	libcrypto.so.1.0.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f5c9486c000)
        [...]
This will usually reveal which libraries (including the crypto ones) are getting some use. I don't think it will reveal statically linked stuff though (you could probably find them somehow with `nm`) but usually security-critical libraries are not linked statically. If you want some additional information on this please check out Ulrich Dreppers [static linking considered harmful]( an this old [discussion]( on the redhead mailinglist. There are also some [counter arguments]( against [dynamic linking](  so check them out as well if you're interested.
