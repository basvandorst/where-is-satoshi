The same thing happened to me last fall when coinbase flagged one of my trades as high-risk.  TBH, that wasn't so bad because support worked it out with me and told me to try again when I'm ready.  I decided to wait a bit and see how things go when I was hit with the $150 or $200 coinbase charge *for bitcoin I never actually received*.  At the time I wasn't expecting any charges so it tied up money I would have spent on something else.  In a day or two it was resolved and in about a week I had my money back.  So that wasn't so bad but was more of one of those perfect storms coalescing together.
But recently I stopped using coinbase because I'd rather pay a 5% fee (until I find a better exchange) at an atm near my house than waste any more time on trying to get my account verified.  I've had my coinbase account for about a year now and I haven't been able to verify it beyond the visa verification thing.  That's a weekly instant buy of only $100 which is severely limiting.  I've even checked my credit report for inconsistencies thinking that something is screwed up there.  Nope.  And when I contact support they tell me to just keep trying and there's nothing they can do because they're "playing it safe".  It's like, I've been purchasing small amounts of btc for a year now with my personal checking, give me something, whether that entails a scan of some of my identification or whatever.
I'll still buy small amounts of BTC  with coinbase when I want to donate to some cool charities or something but I can't deal with a broken system anymore.  I wanna say, "Coinbase, baby, I wanna give you my business, but you won't let me.  Baby, let me!"

It's pretty true, but I mean this is someone who is one (albeit among many) of the faces of bitcoin.  He has a little more than others riding on this.
