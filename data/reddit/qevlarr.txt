Learn from history, this scam has been pulled before. Tether was an obvious wildcat bank from the start.

So you need only a fraction of that to get other people to panic. It snowballs hard. 
I remember one guy in my country who single-handedly caused a bank run in an interview in the morning news. I'm referring to the [DSB bank run](

I mean you only need to withdraw a small part of that least amount of on-hand cash to get the whole thing going. The protesters need not withdraw anywhere near 5%

Smaller groups also having a voice *is* democracy. Democracy is not the majority forcing their will on minorities. And no, HK isn't a democracy. Which is why they're protesting...

This is genius. Two reasons: 
1. Mainland Chinese people have been fed propaganda all their lives that economic prosperity is all that matters. They honestly don't understand why people would protest for something like democracy, if they're so rich. Even if they won't understand that democracy is about more than money, economic protest should get their attention.
2. Bank runs are serious shit. Since banks only have a part of their cash on hand, not everyone can get their cash at once. So it only takes a relatively small group to get the snowball going and then everyone will have to join or lose access to their money. This forces people to join the protest even if they wouldn't join out of political conviction.

Shouldn't we at least not praise him before we're sure? Silk Road was a shady business by its very nature.

No shit. I heard people weigh piles of banknotes on scales to buy groceries.
