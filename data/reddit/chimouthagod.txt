Lol people are actually going to pay tax on crypto gains? XD

There’s several different kinds of wallets: 
Hard Wallet- Basically Ledger and Trezor. By far the most safe and secure of all wallets. 10/10 Would recommend for anyone that’s getting into Bitcoin. You control all your private keys in a hardware wallet.
Soft Wallet- Less secure than a Hard Wallet but still better than keeping it on an exchange. These include Exodus, Copay, Electrum, Jaxx, etc. Usually they’re only as secure as your computer. 
Paper Wallet- A paper wallet is also a very secure. It’s essentially a piece of paper that contains your cryptocurrency address and private keys. The advantage it has is its in cold storage. Meaning it’s not on the internet therefore reduces probability of a  hack. 
I would recommend either a paper or hard wallet especially if you’re holding large amounts of money. Never keep your BTC on an exchange! By keeping them on Coinbase you basically own a IOU for BTC. Not actual BTC.

For real! I bought at 4800 and was so devastated when September came. Looking back I wish I bought more!
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:44:00
See this is what I like to hear. It’s not always about making millions, but simply finding a solution in times of need. Wish you the best of luck in your Bitcoin future. Cheers!

I remember I was in the same position as you just a few months ago. I bought the “peak” at the time, $4,800. Then came September and it dipped to $3,700 I believe. I was devastated and beat myself up. But now look at it at $7,300. Now to answer your question, it all depends on your position. Are you a long term hodler or are you looking to trade? If you’re into it long term and truly believe in BTC buying the peak shouldn’t worry you too much. That doesn’t mean you should pass up buying the dip either. Just don’t worry to much about it too much. BTC has proven over and over again that the “peak” at one point will be the dip at another. However, if you’re looking to trade the price becomes much more relevant. At that point you should try to buy the dip as much as possible. Anything wrong with buy low selling high? Absolutely not. As for you being a beginner, I truly advise against trying to time the market. You’re exposing yourself to an unnecessary amount of risk doing so. Are you willing to take it? Only you can answer that.

I’m 16. Have about $8,000 in BTC. Not including another $2,000 spread between ETH and LTC. Made $1,000  profit last weekend in BTC alone. Haven’t made a “big mistake” yet. To OP just keep calm, cool, and collected. Buy the dip and hodl. Buy low sell high, fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:44:23
Not really, anyone who knows anything about BTC knows it’s nowhere near it’s full potential. Therefore,  at this point in time any price you get in at is a good price. Granted, that doesn’t mean you should buy the peak but don’t stress it if you do. This may change in the future but as of now it’s how it is.

Better late than never. Some people are still clueless to the existence of Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:08:45
Buy now. I would if I had the money. I have a $5,000 check coming in the mail. Unfortunately there’s no post on sundays hopefully it continues to go down until it arrives lmaooo
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:12:01
I know hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:36:27
No. Invest more. You’ll regret it if you don’t.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:12:45
A good lip inspires Ghandi-like wisdom....
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:42
Very dissatisfied with the United States Postal Service however. My $5,000 check didn’t arrive in time to buy the dip :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:45:52
You don’t lose if you don’t sell ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:40:01
I’m on your side. They don’t realise BCH difficultly is going to increase 400% in 15 some hours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:19:10
You don’t lose if you don’t sell 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:47:42
I’m just use Coinbase/Gdax through my Dads account. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:27:22
Dude I’m about to buy $5,000 worth tomorrow when the bank opens. Least of your worries should be $50. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:15:39
Miners and investors are switching to BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:05:15
Mind if I use this some time? ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:04:06
I would be lying if I said it wasn’t ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:06:38
Goodluck man hope you reach your goal. What alts are you currently trading?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:14:34
Nah, it is what it is. I’m buying in before 10k anyway. Long term hodler. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:49:19
Take out that $87 and buy yourself a Ledger my friend
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:47:31
Was really hoping for 4800-5200 by tomorrow :(
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:41:31
But I don’t want to stay with one BTC and just keep looking at it know what I mean? It may sound greedy but I know at some point BTC will reach 50k a piece then it would be impossible to ever get more.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:44
Welcome back!
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:56:25
Oh. 100% agreed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:48:13
Don’t worry mate. By 1Q 2018 you’ll be wishing you bought more at 7300. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:02:05
I remember buying at 4800 in August. It was an all time high at that time. Now I wish I could go back and buy more! Don’t stress it 7000 will be what it dips to by 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:59:04
57 updates? Yeah, not good.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:45:29
Hopefully! I have fiat coming in tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:45
Brooo same. I have a $5,000 check coming in tomorrow. ;(
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:46:26
And this is why you use a hardware wallet  To OP I’m sorry to say but I have no idea :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:38:52
Same here! We started in August though. I’m 16 as well!
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:58
BCH is running a pump and dump scheme. My advice would be to buy up all the dumped BTC around 4900.
