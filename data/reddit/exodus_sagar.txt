Hey Tim,
Thanks for the critical feedback! There seems to be confusion here as to how the Exodus wallet works, as Exodus is locally run software and not a centrally run entity/exchange service., Exodus does not have access to any user's wallets, keys, backup information, or transaction history/activity details.
Although the "un-staking" does happen automatically within the wallet, this can only happen once a user has activated their own EOS wallet on their personal device. This is not an action performed by Exodus the company or any person at Exodus.
We need to do a better job explaining exactly what happens so that this confusion could have been avoided, and we will be releasing a Medium article to better explain how this whole process works shortly.
If you have questions, we would be more than happy to clear up any confusion for you, Tim, if you send an email to us at [support

Hello there, I am sorry for the loss.
Just curious, don't you have the email back-up link sent to you during the initial backup process?

Hey there, this is Sagar from Exodus Community Support team!
It is completely safe to use your Trezor with Exodus since your private keys never leave your hardware wallet. That is the beauty of a hardware wallet :) You can read more about our parthership with Trezor here: [
When you use Trezor with Exodus, the transaction fees is set by Exodus since you are using the Exodus interface to interact with your assets.
Happy to answer any further questions you might have.
Sagar
