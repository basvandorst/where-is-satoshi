Hello just tried it today on my syster's cell. Not only it didn't lock the GPS, now GPS does not work on other apps as well. 
I am very confused. The experience has been disappointing.

No withdraw? That sucks!
I honestly believe the community filled pots concepts.
I'll be honest, I did prepare some MYR wallets to leave nearby the hotspots, although I've primed them with 42 MYR I was planning to post address for some additional reward.  :P
Taking notice of your opinions!

They don't 'change' at all. They effectively run in parallel, except in their goal.
I have this idea of an algo-switching chain but I'm not quite positive about its viability.

Another very important and often neglected advantage is that pumping money in GPU research (or FPGA for that matter) results in something which is beneficial outside of mining. ASICs have considerably little market share, basically limited to a/v codecs and some networking equipment.

Hello, I've been following and playing with MYR for a while and I'm the author of what was possibly the first GCN-specific miner available.
MYR is no more the only coin running multi-algorithm. There have been a few imitations including (last but not least) DGB, which also put some interesting research in security. Let's see if I can remember the name of the guy who did that: Unfortunately, the *groestl-myriad* sub-network (so to speak) was badly timewarped some months ago. I happened to be mining on the same pool as the attacker and I ended up doubling my MYR in a matter of days. It is my understanding this issue has been resolved. Keep in mind the GRS-MYR network was very small at the time  so there's only so much any kind of protection can do.
Keccak is indeed very ASIC friendly, see [the source]( "NIST chose KECCAK over the four other excellent finalists for ... excellent efficiency in hardware implementations". 
The 'wild keccak' variation is quite cool but as it stands now, there's no such thing as a GPU-friendly POW algorithm. I think that effort would be better spent towards non-cryptographic POWs.

What you describe exist, it's `yescrypt`. I have spent considerable effort on it (mostly wrangling the OpenCL driver), somehow managed to squeeze 200% perf from previous implementation and we're still far, far away from CPU.
Other PoWs have been deployed from Password Hashing Competition (Lyra2, Argon2). I cannot comment on those.
Let me be clear that I do not support CPU processing anymore and FPGAs developments should be encouraged IMHO.
