So? The same applies to coinbase and bitcoin. You think 536 Billion dollar was invested into crytpo?. No, only a fraction. If 1 percent of coinbase users try to sell for fiat btc will drop and coinbase won't have enough funds to pay. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:08:57
why would you try to sell here when you could go to one of numerous exchanges or localbitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:33:15
Crypto not, so what's the point. Everybody hating big time on fiat but when it get's serious people can't rely on crypto at all.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:00:59
what a garbage post, zero evidence. Why would bitcoin increase in value for ever? If all these organizations you nmention would be buying, then why is the volume so low. You see sell walls on the exchanges. Nope. Worst post i have seen for a long while.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:16:59
coinbase is not fdic insured
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:05:54
Lmfao. Uber is growing faster than ever. And this ico pumping pieces of garbage is calling it dead because of something that could hypothetically could happen somewhere in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:48:36
No, because a large amount of value stays within an exchange. Only if the amount of market cap that would be lost in the price fall would be exactly the same as the increase, Every penny put in could be withdrawn. If 10 million is put in and it is now worth 100 million. All people could only withdrawaw if they would sell for exactly that amount combined.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:58:37
just sell it on an exchange or local bitcoins instead of trying to scam people. Plz remove scam post.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:48

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:17

You know you are as childish as they are by this winy post
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:39:48
Taking profits at strange values with all 0.01 and 0.03 orders in huge numbers. doesn't see like the normal joe taking profits. Instead more like pump and dump schemes.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:10:20
Yeah that is right. But so long as this is not resolved the price increases are not justified
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:09:16
Salty. This is  one of my first posts. You are confusing me with someone else. Im not from the Bcash site. Im just saying it is delusional to deny the problems right now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:27
It's not it is on 9700
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:41:21
Im in bitcoin longer but the manipulation seems real. I don't care bout the pullback. Just the way it's orchastrated in such a pump and dump scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:23
It just point out the huge liquidity and orderbooks problem bitcoin has. It's balancing o a thin line and only one big sell order and it drops 3000 euro or 4000 dollar on some exchanges that a 40 percent drop in 15 minutes
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:28:07
You mean there is manipulation going on
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:27:09
You mean under 9000

To 7000 you mean over 300o euro. Liquidity is basically 0
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:53:50
it is all spam about buying a tesla and reaching new ath without talking about the underlying reasons. Mean time  bitcoin is dying with these problems
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:06
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:38:25
It's done with all sell and buy orders off 0.01 and 0.03. It's not about the fact that it declines a bit. It's about the fact the market is clearly being manipulated which is never a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:21:53
I just stepped out of my time machine, the crash will happen in 3 hours 6 minutes and 31 seconds
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:13:43
By seeing these type of memes i think bitcoin is turning in some toy or meme instead of an actual asset/monetary system.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:39:57
You really don't get it do you? It's not about the loss of value. It's about the liquidity being so low that it just drops 3000 euro/1000 dollar in 15 minutes. Basically this means it is a bubble and it can burst within a day
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:45:20
Only because of the non existent volume 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:43:22
It is not segwit. It's the nonexistent volume. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:31:11
It is basic economy. Who is gonna spend a penny on items except basic needs if the money you save buys you 5 percent more every year. The economy will decline big time. Because everybody saves as much as possible.

@_date: 2018-03-18 16:27:59
so you can make more losses?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:54:48
no, they just manipulate it up and down to make huge profits
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:45:59
that is what everybody said caused the run up to 20k but it didnt, just a set up pump and dump of an unregulated commodity
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:40:28
Fee problem indeed. But just because fees are low now doesnt mean the problem is fixed. Fees are only low because there is no volume once the volume picka up the mempool is full again. So i dont get why everyone is hyping up these aetificially low fees. Segwit and lighntning are still in babyshoes.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:29:39
So basically btc volume is very low and nobody is using it. And you turn it around to be a positive thing. How funny. Always unjustified unlimited positivity.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:07:46
you mean 6k tonight
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:03:29
it is not fud. If 1500 to 20k is realistic then this is to. The bubble has burst. Stop denying it
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:21:59
you know that deflation is as bad as inflation?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:15:37
yeah dream on. Im not keen on lambos either. But certainly not on chavvy cars. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:02:06
total bs because it is not even the daily volume people are making up all these bs reasons for the bubble burst
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:29:25
Yeah im from the netherlands so the autobahn is not a strange place for me. a chav is a well know english word (you're probably stupid because you dont know the word)is a lower-class person typified by brash and loutish behaviour.

Not saying it kills of usd. But the comparison with S&amp;P 500 is totally retarded. What does bitcoin create in value? Nothing, no jobs, products, food or whatever. So why tf would it even come close to the stock market. Never seen such a retarded post.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:44:13
Only because volume is dropping hard 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:36:52
omg are you serious no its not for christ sake watch the gdax order book for a bit. changing the price 100 in 5 seconds has nothing to do with arbitrage you dont get my explanation above
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:22:48
deflationary is as bad as inflation because noone is gonna spend much knowing their 1 btc is worth more every year
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:12:45
Because for 1 million to happen it would have to be a world currency. And it doesnt behave like the S&amp;P one bit. It can never affect the world like the stock market because bitcoin isnt creating any wealth at all. It just a payment method and not a capital asset. Company's create something and therefore have value.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:24:29
You not knowing wha chav is just confirms my statement, look it up on google. Wonder what clothing brands you wear to match that car.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:11:52
It is not only for unneccesarry shit. That is an argument against your own statement. Because with deflationary currency the rich will only get richer. People will get pay cuts instead of pay raises. The system will just be another one like we have today.

Yeah and of what does the S&amp;P consists of. Value creating companies. The S&amp;P 500 is not a commodity. It consists of all companies creating our society. You must be delusional comparing that to a crypto. You could compare bitcoin to one company of the s&amp;p 500 when you take the small benefits of btc that could create any value to our society. Wealth isnt created out of nothing. The dollar is a unit. The 21 trillion were created by hundreds of years of value creation. Everything that build our modern society is in that cap. How is that even remotely the same as btv. It doesnt create jobs, food, products.

@_date: 2018-02-07 17:13:08
lmfao watch the order book. The first sell or buy in the order book is always between 3 or 9 or 17 and 22. Whenever it switches from the sell to the buy side it means a short automated run up with almost only buys.No matter how large a wall is. Then when it switches back same on the  opposite to sell again with profits. You should observe the market mate
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:01:36
then watch gdax rn. Selling and buying isnt happening 60/40 its 10 minutes straight buying then reversing. In whatever way they want the price to move.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:14:08
Im not saying its worse. It is just as bad. The rich will only get richer because they can save more. Search for the theory. It is from way before youre so called bankers were printing money like crazy.

Ask yourself why you have bought bitcoin? If it's for the wrong reasons get out. Why would it drop to 1400? Because you read some bs article. Everybody is saying something different. Some say it will be at 10.000 this years others say it will crash. If you believe in Bitcoin Hodl. If not, sell them.
