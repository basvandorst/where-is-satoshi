If you want a legit currency you cant have high volatility. Makes trade very difficult.

Ok. if you want a currency, something to trade with, it needs to have stable value to be useful. Think about why USD is popular in third world countries.

Yikes. Typical bitcoin cult member with no grasp on economics. 
\&gt; Venezuelan Bolivar is 100% stable. 1 bolivar is 1 bolivar, always will be.
Bitcoin is great and all and definitely a currency but people like you give it a really bad name. I never said it wasn't a currency, I said it cannot be volatile to be legitimate.

Don't worry, OP doesn't understand them either...

The whole fiat is bad!1!1! The government is printing more monies!!
Bitcoin is not going to overtake the USD. People quote government debt figures and the whole debt is inherently bad!!! does not stand up under economic scrutiny.

Yeah so much lack of understanding of basic economics.

I am a supporter of bitcoin, it definitely doesn't need to overtake the USD to be valuable. It is strange claims that Bitcoin will somehow flip the whole 'system' on its head that cause negative coverage.
Excessive debt does have negatives. But define 'excessive' and the 'system'. 
Savings would only lose value if they are not gaining interest in line with inflation. It is lenders that actually lose out in this scenario as the real value of their income declines. High inflation, although related, is a seperate issue, to excess debt.
If your idea of an anti-fragile and risk averse investment is Bitcoin then you have another thing coming.
