There is no way to prove it, but telling them it was hacked should at least make the exchange suspicious and double check the deposit and the identity of the user.
At least it's worth trying.

UX is what drives mass adoption. Unfortunately the crypto world fails to understand that.
What the average user wants is something that is simple and easy to use. These products should be designed with not only privacy in mind but also UX, which is unfortunately never the case.

From my own experience, most people don't understand what it means for Bitcoin to be "decentralized". It makes no sense to them that it can work without a central authority, so they don't realize that there is nobody to complain to if they lose their coins. They can't wrap their heads around the idea that there is no "Bitcoin CEO" and company. I try to explain them, but 1 week later they forgot everything.
Also, they seem to have lost all sense of responsibility, probably because today there is always some kind of safety net when you make a mistake. Well, not with Bitcoin. So yeah, be sure to keep a copy of their backup keys.

If people make fun of you, it means it's a very good time to buy.
If everyone starts to be interested (as in late 2017), it's time to think about selling everything.

The main problem with investing your entire life savings is that, if you don't have an emergency fund that can cover unexpected expenses, you may be forced to sell when Bitcoin is at 3k even if you don't want to.

I'm amazed at the complexity of US taxes on crypto... Here in France, we usually have the worst taxes for everything but even for crypto our system is less bad (only crypto-to-fiat trades are taxable events).
Who in their right mind taxes airdrops and hard forks? If even France doesn't tax it, you can be sure your politicians are batshit crazy.

It's a fair price to pay to have the privilege to use their awesome user interface. /s

Currently Bitcoin acts as digital gold, and it's already much safer to own than real gold.
Also I'm not sure that the 85% of the world population who live in third-world countries would agree with your analysis of the security of fiat. Let's ask Venezuelans and see what they think about it.

Institutional investors are almost always the problem, they are slowly killing Bitcoin with their overuse of derivatives products while manipulating the market to make insane profits.
And of course they don't keep their own keys. Most of them don't have the slightest clue how crypto works, yet they make 90% of the trading volume. It's not looking good.

99% of people buying Bitcoin have no idea what the halving is. The remaining 1% have no idea what it means for it to be priced in. Should the price go up by $1,000? $10,000? And go up compared to what price, $3,000? $20,000? Nobody has any clue... therefore it's not priced in.

To be honest, it may not be a bad thing... 99% of crypto videos on YouTube are complete crap full of referral links, most of them are centered around trading and making a quick buck, without providing any real understanding of the underlying technology and why it's revolutionary.
Such videos are not good for adoption. They only attract short-term speculators, for others they just reinforce the idea that crypto are scams or purely speculative tools.

Let's see what people think when a recession hits Europe and banks avoid bankruptcy by stealing the funds of their clients. Yes, this is legal in the EU and banks will 100% do that. Actually, this law was already used once by Bank of Cyprus to save itself.
After all, Bitcoin was created as an answer to the 2008 crisis. Mass adoption may very well come from the next financial crisis. Whether Bitcoin is legal or not will not matter if people lose all faith in banks, they will get creative.
