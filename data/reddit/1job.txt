I guess we'll see in 18months give or take. Just want crypto technology to succeed.

Why wouldn't you want blocksize increases? Technology is and always will be improving, what was expensive 10 years ago is now the cheapest option. 500Gb HDD's cost as much as a single on-chain BTC transaction.   
If you're creating an off-chain scaling solution you may as well use another coin as a 'silver' to BTC's gold. Off-chain fundamentally alters the function of a coin, once LN goes into affect BTC will be nothing like the original whitepaper.

Bravo you found the conspiracy.  
Seriously dude? This was a market correction after crazy inflation due to hype. There's no boogie man out to get BTC.  
This is people realizing they cant move their $50 of BTC without paying $49 in fees unless they are one of the few that have a segwit supported wallet and are sending to another segwit wallet.  
This is people realizing that the Mempool is approaching/over 200,000 pending transactions (~175Mb).  
BTC is still up from where it was a month ago, just chill.

Great idea!  
Hey everyone! Stop trying to use the thing for the purpose that the thing was created!  
Then it will magically start working when everyone tries to use it again.  
This isnt an attack orchestrated by the BTC Boogie Man, it's market adoption (you know, the thing we've wanted since BTC started) and now BTC is choking from all the people and lack of scaling.
INB4 "B...b...but the LN will fix it" WHEN? It's been 18months for quite a while.

The use case in this example is "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" if you cant use it to send Electronic Cash Peer-to-Peer at a reasonable price then what's the point, that is the function of Bitcoin is it not? You might as well use the existing non-blockchain technologies provided by Banks.
