Thanks, but I'm not about to smash my 5s just because apple doesn't support Bitcoin.

yes, the strategy behind dollar cost averaging makes sense for long term investments. 
Bitcoin as the long term investment vehicle, however, isn't great because of its extreme volatility.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:22:53
they may have the same amount of BTC, but now those bitcoins aren't worth as much. It makes sense that they are worried about that. just like you might be worried if a long hold stock tanked. Also, the 20T debt is in a large part offset by US GDP growth, which is currently growing faster than the debt. GDP/Debt ratio is more important than debt by itself. In 2017, USAs debt/gdp was 105.4, down from 105.8 in 2016. Compare that to japan, at 225, greece, at 185, Spain at 111.5, and the UK at 103.5. In fact, the average for developed countries is 111, which means that the US has a better than average debt to GDP ratio.

you have to convert btc to usd to make any meaningful purchases. even if you are buying purely in btc, the btc price of an item is based on the equivalent usd price.. nah i think people have lost a shit ton in value. . say what you will about "fiat currency being worthless".. good god man that is delusional

that is funny i would bet some people do care, especially the ones who want it to go up, way up.

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:39:20
so anyone that is "fulfilled" was born lucky, and didn't earn it? Why does it even bother you in the first place? wait.. are you not salaried? if so then i could see why me referring to a salary might hit a nerve. also - having a salary vs not having one doesn't mean much when it comes to being fulfilled. I wish you the best.

my salary is in usd. i haven't had any problems with its volatility, or buying things with it. if btc really was a need right now, the price wouldn't be so volatile, and it certainly wouldn't be in the shitter. society seems alright from my side. Maybe you're the kind of person who thinks the world is falling apart though. again, best of luck with however much you had in btc.

"when BTC rebounds"
Sounds a lot like speculation on your part there
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:14:15
"bull runs and bear runs be damned" is not a great strategy for any investment.
Especially when dealing with something as uncertain and volatile as bitcoin. it is wise to monitor something that can move that fast. 
I didn't say anything about a DCA plan in itself being bad for long term investments. DCA is great for long term investments - it just depends on the product. Where I work we call it an AIP.

too bad cold storage can't protect from rapid depreciation
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:18:00
When a trendline looks that overly bullish, I don't think it matters who made it. for the next 4-5 months, btc will be lucky to hold 5k. The idea of decentralized digital currency is a good one, but the world is going to have to decide on one coin, and right now all the various coins are saying "I'm the one, I'm the one" while problems keep appearing about the popular coins. I think it will be a big deal 15 years from now if everything gets figured out. Right now cryptocurrencies are kind of a hype fueled shit show.

It's like you think people aren't allowed to be concerned about the value of their investments falling rapidly. Maybe you should cash out and buy puts, at least then you'd be less stressed about holding a bag.

it is still entirely possible for blockchain as an idea to be good, but bitcoin to not be so great. bitcoin doesn't do blockchain justice.

Long term plans for retirement usually stay away from investment products with this level of volatility.
this isn't "measured and sound retirement accumulation". If it was you would be buying pipelines, alternatives, maybe some higher yield bonds, REITS.
this is throwing 200 a month at something which has extreme volatility, and then choosing to disregard price changes, and potentially the reasons behind them - because you think that btc has tremendous upside.
Bitcoin is the kind of investment that i would relegate to a separate account that I don't care what happens to. Not what I would be banking on for my retirement.

value.. meaning bitcoin is worth less than it was 2 months ago. it is worth less money. you no longer have as much monetary value. you are losing money on an investment. That value.

alternative investments.. They aren't correlated with the market. I have money in life insurance policy backed bonds that pay 9% annually consistently. Then Self Storage REITs. Has made me 13% annually over past 4 years.

Are you sure you don't care about all the purchasing power you have lost as Bitcoin has rapidly depreciated?
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:13:52
Ok. But what if it continues falling (which is what I see happening)

in a relatively short timespan, bitcoin has fallen from 22k to 3.2k. You absolutely have lost significant value. Cut your losses and try out option trading if you want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:07:39
someone who knows that they should cut their losses and put the money somewhere that is more likely to appreciate in value for the time being. You can keep holding on to bitcoin, or you can buy something else for now and wait for BTC to bottom. know when to cut losses.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:00:20
Lots of stocks move much faster than 5% in a month. Have you heard of AMD? Talk about hype.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:27:50
You don't know that BTC will come back up. Why would it?
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:50:39
uhh.. I think the reason you could buy bitcoin cheaper years ago was because BTC had not yet appreciated in value to ridiculous levels.. not because of rapid inflation of the USD. 
Also, all you have to do to keep your buyer's power year over year is invest it in a product (alternative investment - e.g. a REIT) that keeps up with or beats inflation (Currently 2.2% if you look at the CPI). If I can buy more things with my USD than I could last year because I put it in something that grew it's value at a steady rate, I'd call that an appreciating asset, not a depreciating one. You are nuts man.
The USD is not plummeting. I'm not sure where you got that information.
Last I checked, it was BTC where people have the largest unrealized losses, and they get very angry about it, saying "Last chance to get on before we rocket to 100k, bankers are forcing panic selling, hodl, etc." and yet here it is now, still falling.
Know when to cut a loss.
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:50:40
All currencies have the ability to appreciate or depreciate in value. When your currency depreciates in value, you lose buying power. That is always a bad thing. Cut your losses and preserve your ability to buy groceries.
