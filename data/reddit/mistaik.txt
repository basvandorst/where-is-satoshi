Many societies were slave-free. No societies had justice systems without "violence." Just like many prime movers did not depend on internal combustion, though *none* were perpetual motion engines. So shit point.


"Wrong"? Is wealth disparity wrong? What a weird thing to ask. 
Slavery is "wrong" for today's society, its negatives outweigh the positives. That's why it's uncommon/takes new forms [which are more acceptable to today's morality]. At the time when it was common, it was right as rain.
"Wrong," to have meaning, must be predicated, it needs a subject. "Wrong for *whom*?" What's wrong for the slave is not wrong for the slave owner, or for mankind as a whole. The Ancient Egypt, classical Greece -- those would not have been possible without slavery (along with the sciences, art, philosophy, and political constructs like Democracy).
So the answer is "no" to "was it wrong," "yes" if you asked "is it wrong now."


I honestly don't want my kid getting strung out on dope, if we're talking about drug cartels. OTOH, if you mean *street gangs*, no one outlawed turf, bitches, or money.

Assuming that you're referring to a societal need -- to "Eat At Joe's!"  -- that would be equally impossible, with or without the use of USD. Because there's no way millions of people would fit inside Joe's Diner -- it would be carnage, a frickin' bloodbath! Luckily, everyone in society doesn't want to Eat At Joes, and that's why Joe does a brisk, though unexceptional, business.
Just like everyone in society doesn't want to forage dumpsters for food, because they want nothing to do with USD. Most are fine with it. If they weren't they'd get wasted, pick up their janky muzzle-loaders and kick some ass. Because taxation without representation, FU redcoats!


Huh? Have I suggested that a bitcoin exchange is like a central bank? Show me where, and I'll cut out my lying tongue!
Of course an exchange is nothing like a central bank. It's an exchange, like Forex. It does not issue currencies, for one. Well, not before the BFX token :D 


Sure cops use force. The proposition is quite specific: "Stop, or I'll shoot" -- if(U !Stop) -&gt; (U Drop); Cops (in theory) stop you from/for comitting crimes. Not using USD is not a crime. It's dumb as dirt, precludes you from doing many fun things, but it's not a crime.
What you *seem* to be suggesting with money is something like 
1. If I work for Ron Paul, he pays me in turnips, and the fair market value of those turnip is $10,300 or more (maximum sum you can earn, per year, without having to file your taxes), I would need to file taxes.
2. The US government, tyrants that they are, refuse to accept turnips. They want their worthless scrip, which they print out of thin air anyhow, it costs them nothing, so clearly they're just being dicks.
3. I, being dim of wit and without basic social skills, refuse to sell a few turnips for filthy government toilet paper, and send that [substantial] sum to the fucking extortionist thieves. because I'm like that, I got principles, won't give teh Devil His due. That's how I roll.
4. Upon learning this, gubermint extortionists ~~pee themselves laughing~~ send their jackbooted thugs to kick in my door and rob me of my turnip fortune. Which is justly mine and I want. To Have.
That's, roughly, the logic, correct?
Well yes you freeloading special snowflake, not paying taxes when you make more than $10 grand a year is a crime. Don't do crimes. Or stop using our clean air, clean water (EPA), safe streets, living on our land, etc., etc. and GTFO to Somalia or some shit. This is really getting tedious.

Where's the problem? Sure, the law is not some statist piece of shit, but the law that cartel members agreed to abide by.


Exactly. And gangsters are also only gangsters because arbitrary state law, and are forced to settle their turf disputes with .25 poppers and crappy Glocks &amp; not courts of law.

 2. A grammar, which tells how well-formed formulas (abbreviated wff) are constructed out of the symbols in the alphabet. It is usually required that there be a decision procedure for deciding whether a formula is well formed or not.
 3. A set of axioms or axiom schemata: each axiom must be a wff.

This conversation started with you claiming that you can't survive in US without having to use filthy fiat. 
**IRS requires you to file a tax return if you make more than $10,300 a year. That's more than $28 a day. Half of the people on this planet live on less than $2.50 a day.**
So yeah, yes you can survive in US without using filthy fiat. Keep transacting in turnips (see Ron Paul Turnip example above). Unless you make more than $28 worth of turnips a day (a fortune by global standards), jackbooted government thugs won't kick down your door.
TL;DR: Not only could you survive, you can live like a king in US without paying taxes. Legally. So do it :)

...and that's why people don't use paper wallets for Bitcoin transactions with untrusted parties. They also don't use cabbages, or cans connected by a piece of string. Because those are as useless as the paper wallet you keep bringing up.
Because Bitcoin doesn't work like that, not sure how much simpler I can make this.
Which is not to say that the USB stick is any better. To use the OpenDime stick, you *must have access to the internet*. 
With internet access, you have access to [free online wallets, like this]( So you can use bitcoin the way it was meant to be used, or almost. Edit: If unclear, the person you are dealing with can create a free online wallet, in seconds, and have you send him B from your wallet. No paper, usb sticks, or trust required.
Online wallets are not as secure as a full node, making them unsuitable for large sums/long-term storage.  Which are exactly the things advises against in the OpenDime FAQ. OpenDime is not to be used for large sums or as cold storage. 
I also trust blockchain.info more than I trust my computer to a proprietary, closed-source black box from OpenDime, though that's just me.

Even though our mutual friend Google has shown you claim of a bank not being a person to be dead wrong, your assertion that a bank cannot be extradited, V&amp;, or put in jail is right on the money. Partially due to logistics -- unwieldiness of bank offices and office chairs therein, that sort of thing. 
Which is not to say that a bank's CEO may not be extradited, the bank's assets frozen, or, if the offence is grave enough and Japan fails to comply with request for extradition?

Sure. Those trades will have nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin.
I can issue a BeanieBabies ETF, tracking the performance of Princess Di Beanie. The holder of this exchange-traded instrument will be able to "make a million trades a second." This is not to suggest that BeanieBabies adoption is on the rise, or that BeanieBabies scaling and divisibility problems have been solved.
It *might* positively affect the market price of Princess Di BeanieBabies tho, there's that. Of course, manipulating the market price of PDBB will become highly profitable too...

In other words, if the "device" is used in $12.50 / (~$.15 per tx) = 83 transactions^1, it pays for itself? 
^1. Those transactions won't be with me, because I don't want dozens of [breakable] USB sticks in my wallet.


It would be a nice proof of concept if it was open source, and I knew that the security it provides is not imaginary, and that it's not installing another root kit on my 'puterbox every time I stick it in the USB port. A black box is a mystery, not a proof of concept.

Roughly the same thing one gets by reporting a rape: showing the rapist that rape could have negative consequences.
Reporting a rape won't make your butt whole again, so it seems counterintuitive to go through the hassle of reporting the rapist, yet it's not. It rebiases the risk/reward ratio, thus making rape less likely to happen in the future. To you in particular, and in your community as a whole.

Again, if we're gonna talk God vs. Nature, we're talking metaphysics: we're not dealing with mundane stuff, like "where do I get the good shit," we're actually questioning meta-concepts, like "what constitutes good" and "is it possible to subject the transcendent, e.g.God, to the rules of mundane logic."

Look, if you want to call it an exchange, you're free to do so. To most Bitcoin traders, an exchange means something that has a matching engine,


If you feel that an exchange doesn't require a matching engine, then   notions like "OTC" 


...become meaningless (or a null set). Because every exchange of one currency for another, such as hooking up with KoinKin1975 in the McD parking lot at 3am, becomes an exchange transaction.

Bitcoin exchanges do not settle trades on the blockchain. It's all done internally, in a plain old database. That's why an exchange doesn't need to wait hours for each trade to confirm, and why Bitcoin (the network) isn't overloaded by transactions from a single exchange.

If by "leading," you mean forcing you to examine your "perspective," then won't lie, that's exactly what I'm doing. That's how rational debate works -- a statement is clarified and formalized (e.g. by asking [leading?] questions to reach an agreed-upon wff), at which point we can see if this wff leads to a contradiction (breaks the law of noncontradiction, ~(A &amp; ~A)), and is, therefore, garbage.

What an odd question. To me, it's like having to answer if we should have more flour in our cakes, or less. We should have *the right amount,* of the *right kind* of flour.
Society is dynamic, exists in time, in constant flux -- too little freedom inevitably leads to bad things, like too much freedom (violent revolt), which may in turn lead to too little freedom (dictator rising to power), or another society's jackboots coming on over and kicking in our door in the middle of the night, because we partied too hard and made too much noise. It's really touchy and complicated.
Freedom is not an intrinsic good. In the most basic sense, as I understand it, it's the *absence* of constraints. The fusee in my clock is *not* free to move independently of the pendulum, which, in turn, *governs* the escapement, which dictates the speed of the minute hand, which must not, in turn, move independently of the hour hand and so on. That lack of freedom is what makes the clock useful. Welcome to the machine :)

Just like there's no requirement that you purchase money or grow it. What's your point?


1. Ask Mom for food.
2. Ask strangers for food (beg).
3. Dive dumpsters for food (forage).
My heart is three sizes too big, so I'm helping you out with these helpful hints. It's not my responsibility.


In order to survive in NYC, you need about 4 grand a month. You're like a kid calling his parents with "Ma, I can't survive in NYC for less than 3 grand a month!" "Well Pumpkin, maybe you should GTFO of New York, and find some place where you can?"
If you can't live in US,you are free to:
1. leave.
2. die.
Why is this any different than Pumpkin demanding to live in NYC?


That works. I said no one owes you a living. That literally means that if you chose to die (over having to use filthy statist toilet paper scrip), you are free to do so. That's a valid choice, your world view would, as a minimum, would become intrinsically consistent :)

The kind that doesn't have a trade engine is called  bazaar. When Christ cleansed the Temple and drove out the money changers, he broke up a bazaar, or, as he called it, "a den of thieves." He did not h4x9r an exchange. If you want to call a bunch of guys hawking their wares a currency exchange, you're free to do so. I won't judge.


An alpha is essentially the first version of an app released for testing to the public. If it takes years to get from alpha to production release, that doesn't mean the app didn't exist years ago -- it means the dev team is molasses.

Correct, an that "what" is usually trivial shit, like coins moving from address X to address Y, which happens all the time, is neither good nor bad, and certainly not against the law. Without the "who," this info is unenlightening, e.g no one sounded the alarm when Gox coin moved from X to Y, nor when the same shit happened at Cryptsy. 
The beautiful thing about legacy finance is this: Once you figure out that "what" [~$72 million US moving from thousands of addys to other addys] was bad_shit, you can actually go after the malefactor, because you know "who" and "where."

@_date: 2016-08-24 15:44:56


Yes, multiple meanings, here's the one Google brings up:


Abovementioned "law" is imposed on us by statist oppressors  and enforced, at gunpoint, by jackbooted thugs. So by conventional definition, "corporation" is predicated on state &amp; its arbitrary tyrannical laws; "corporation" can not exist outside of state, the two are intrinsically linked. 
That's why I erred on a more liberal definition of corporation, "an organization of individuals formed to foster a shared goal, e.g. financial gain."
But you say that's overbroad. K. Please offer an alternative definition we could both agree on, one which doesn't involve the state sticking its dumb fingers into other people's pies.


Absolutely. And unsafe household wiring kills more people than curare. That's not because curare is safe and delicious, but because it's much less prevalent. The whole world is a statist shithole, though it's, arguably, not a drug cartel.

It's not certain that Bitcoin exchanges will be robbed. And when they do get robbed, it's usually in the thousands, not millions. My point stands tho. The reason that Bitcoin exchanges are impossible to insure is Bitcoin's fundamental tenet -- aversion to oversight/regulations. 
Standardised security protocols? Huh? Remember how BitPay tried to get a settlement from its insurer because CTO got duped into calling CEO and asking him to send a few mil in BTC to a certain addy? Twice? And CEO, being a bro, did?
How do you insure shit like that?

Think of it like this: 
1. Your insurance company tells you to get locks for your house, or it'll drop your policy. 
2. You buy my top-of-the-line AwsumLock locks; ask me to install them.
3. When I politely suggest that AwsumLocks, awesome they are, won't do diddly if I drive a rusty nail, and hang a key on it next to every lock (as you asked me to do), you reply with:
4. I know brah, I'm only doing it to be compliant with my insurance company's demands. If the doors are actually locked, my buddies won't be able to come on over whenever they want, and crash on my house. Don't worry about it.

I guess. In the same sense as "not buying BTC is a part of trading activity." By "holding," you mean "not actively selling BTC that was bought," right?


You're right, most people won't buy 1000 cases of TP even though they know that TP price is almost certain to go up over time. TP was probably not the best choice -- not a speculative commodity; different user base (TP users aren't as price-conscious as currency traders); is bulky (storage costs); etc., etc.

If I said that freedom is a bad thing, your analogy would be more accurate. I didn't. If you want to go with your "free thought" analogy, a structurally identical statement would be "free thought is not intrinsically good (not merely instrumental but good *in and of itself*)."

Edit: Going with "free thought," imagine you're studying for a math test, and you can't focus, that tab of acid has freed your mind, it oozed through the doors of perception &amp; ended up in pure white light stupidity.

Not sure I understand. You're saying lawmakers could write laws with loopholes &amp; open to interpretation? Sure, everything's possible. The body of law is in constant flux tho, so if those loopholes start getting exploited often enough (or when those exploiting the loopholes get loud/annoying enough), the loopholes get plugged up. For better or worse.

You would be a criminal if BTC was illegal, so would your mom. By definition.


That would be less likely if BTC is illegal. At least I hope, have no idea how you bring up your (hopefully imaginary) kids. And I understand how you "don't give a fuck" because you're an edgy 14-yr.-old, but grownups don't like to do crimes if they can help it.

I'm not suggesting that anyone is forcing her to use bitcoin, merely saying that she won't do it if BTC is illegal. If law-abiding people don't use bitcoin, bitcoin will be exactly what the mainstream press paints it as: the criminals' currency.
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:00:29
I see. This is a semantic misunderstanding. I'll clarify:
Governments can make anything illegal by passing a law against it.
This does not mean that the illegal thing will disappear. Rape and murder, for instance, are still with us, even though both are illegal.
Now you may disagree with the law, because you got edge and stuff, but that only makes you a criminal *in the eyes of the law*, which is what we're talking about here. De jure criminality.
Now there are unjust law, and people who break them are good people, but in the eyes of the law they're criminals. 
I hope I've cleared up this misunderstanding of ours.

Look, I'm not sure we even disagree. I assumed that when you said


...you meant your parents did this without accruing debt. Turns out they did have to borrow. They didn't do it via CC because CCs don't, typically, give construction loans. What did you mean? That your parents never had CCs? 
I also misspoke when I said that it was impossible to live an upper-middle-class life on a lower-middle-class income. I failed to factor in inheriting land, getting loans to build on it, and being lucky. I've apologized.


They do exist, and you're paying for them each time you use your debit card. Because, unless I'm mistaken, you don't get discounts for using debit cards over credit.

My case doesn't need help. I want to establish what it is you mean, when you use the word monopoly. For that, I need you to define it. Because you don't want to use the standard one, outlined in Wikipedia, in which trademarks, patents, copyright laws, etc. are examples of government-granted monopolies. 


All the markets, including DNMs, are regulated. 


Yes, obviously so. So what?
So you don't say that "taxes are like being told to pick up my trash," even though the repercussions of both littering and not paying your taxes are the same  -- having a gun pointed at your head, and death. Because if you insist on not picking up your trash, and keep escalating the situation, you will have a gun pointed at your head, and, if you continue to resist, your brains will become unsightly, foul-smelling litter on the sidewalk. 
They are further identical in the sense that no one, in US, was ever shot for littering, or not paying his taxes. Duh.




No, that justifies me demanding you pay rent, or calling my friends, the jackbooted thugs, if you refuse to pay it *AND* refuse to leave.
Because that's what the gubermint does when you don't pay your taxes. 
Did the guberment bend you over, stick a girthy FED cock up your butt, and make you squeal like a piggy? How is it you don't understand that while I'm willing to humor you by entertaining your asinine analogies, an analogy is *not* the thing? 
While I may compare you to a summer day, and tell you that thou art more lovely and more temperate, and that tough winds do shake the darling buds of May, they don't break out of your puckered sphincter, I can not follow this through: you do not appear at sunrise, and, sadly, do not vanish with dusk. Get it?


You're positing that in principle, it is violence that makes rape wrong, and then proceeding to compare it to taxes, which are also wrong because violence.


No such law has ever existed. The land which you call yours was, once upon a time, *not* owned by pesky injuns, who, by and large, did not believe inn the concept of land ownership. Our freedom-loving forefathers came on over, donned their jackboots, and took it from them. So if you want to follow "Natural Law," kindly pull up stakes and take your sideshow elsewhere.

No. you do not "own" the land in you neighborhood. For the very reasons I have described. 
If someone sold you that land saying "pay me for this land, and you can do whatever the fuck you want to with it, like secede &amp; start your own country," they lied to you &amp; you've been had. You bought a set of rights, closely resembling those of the rights that would be granted you had you bought an apartment, in an apartment building, to wit:
1. You can live there, as long as you pay your fucking property taxes.
2. You can do certain types of building, like put up a house that is approved by your community. But not any fucking house, you retard. You can not build a skyscraper, a factory, or a taco stand: because zoning laws. Before you build, you have to get a building permit, which could be denied you for multiple reasons.
3. In many cases, you can not even put a wrecking ball to the shitty house that stands on "your" land, or paint it a different color. That's because George Washington slept there; historical landmark; suck it up.
4. Often, you can not even fatten cattle or raise pigs on your lawn. Because health regulations.
5. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So now you can see why buying land is much like buying an apartment, in an apartment building.


It is. And that's why you can't sing Kumbaya at 3 am with your buddies in your apartment, or poop in "your" stairwell. Because that's how society works, we [the people in your apartment building] decide what is a "good enough reason." If you don't agree, you can move the fuck out, and move into another apartment building. 
Or a cardboard box, behind some dumpster. 
We don't care, we never like you anyway :)


You don't, just like you don't own the village commons, or the hallway in your apartment building. It's owned by the community. This community is called "a country." 


Because the last community that was around, the pesky Indians, was disorganised and fragmented; did not believe in the concept of land ownership. So we bought some land for peanuts, and then we killed most of them.
That's how you get land, Sweetness.


There is no exact, perfect governance of human beings, just like there is no exact, perfect cake recipe. Life is strife, Sweetpotato, a dialectic, a self-referential process through which you seek its meaning, which, as we all know, is 42.

Please understand that fiat money is not meant to be ~~hoarded in your mattress~~ saved. That's not what it's for. 
Keeping your savings in fiat makes only slightly more sense than keeping them in pancakes, t-bone steaks, or ice cream. This doesn't mean the above are worthless, only that they will deteriorate, depreciate if you will, when you store them for years. 
You knew about inflation when you were making your "hard-earned bucks," no one mislead you. Just like your butcher didn't mislead you when he sold you that T-bone steak -- you knew it would depreciate if you kept it in your mattress for a few years.

Not sure I understand, you mean hoi polloi acting any which way they choose? That's more anarchy, possibly some strain of neo-libertarianism -- not communism. Communism "is a social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society." Sounds like a circular definition, because "communism" is a process, a state of becoming -- not its end goal, which is "A society characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless." So communists may use totally unsmurfy methods to reach that goal, just like hedonists may go through periods of pain, if the pain will lead to maximising [overall] pleasure.

1. Threat of force is always wrong.
2. You own the land you call yours.


I'll start you off. According to you, asking you to pay taxes is "initiation of force [which] is wrong." I point out that if that is wrong, so is asking you for your rent. Because if you continue refusing to pay it, I'll call my friends, the other jackboots, who'll forcibly toss you out of my house. That your mom refusing to up your allowance is also a threat of force, because if you chose to defend your natural right [to have more allowance], she'll give you a time out, put you in the corner; if you refuse, she'll forcefully put you there and, if she's smart, slap you upside the head (which she clearly hasn't done enough) -- thereby "initiating" force.
Or maybe you initiated force when you refused to pay your fucking rent, thrown trash in the street, wouldn't stop nagging Mom about your allowance? Yeah, I'd say you did.


~~Retard~~ Friend: 
While I readily admit that my dislike of rape is irrational, as is my weakness for the juxtaposition of light cerulean blue and reddish rust brown, inferring from this that all of my views are similarly subjective is retarded. Or, as you college-trained redditors would say, *non sequitur.*
This, my aspy friend, is an example of your "junk derivations." Here's another:


1. What makes the act of having sex with someone rape is threat of unwanted force
2. What makes the act of making you pay for your pornos is threat of unwanted force
3. Therefore, both are wrong.  Q.E. Fuckin' D.
As I said, my continuing to reasoning with you is a prima facie case of my irrationality; I'd have a better chance of reasoning with a rusty bucket, and yet ...here we are.
~~Will answer the rest of your wackiness withing an hour, IRL calls.~~


What a curious concept, what does it mean? Do cows have self-ownership? 


In the same sense as cows own their bodies, I suppose. Western ethics [your "morality] hold suicide to be wrong, for one. Authorities can lock you up in a nuthouse if they see you try it. Be careful.
So yeah, we "own our bodies," but roughly in the same sense that we own the apartment or land that we bought -- can do certain things, can't do others. Until you reach the age of maturity [randomly chosen by others, and clearly a long way off 4u], you're pretty much "owned" by your parents. You gotta do what Mom says. Like a fucking slave :|


Of course that troubles me, and that's why I pay my taxes, so's my jackbooted thugs will keep people I don't like ["mafia organization[s]"] from coming on over and turning me into bone meal. Because that's what wars are -- an asshat deciding he needs Lebensraum, and that my people are fucking cattle, to be slaughtered. He comes on over, my jackboots fight his jackboots, and life goes on. 
If not for taxes to pay our violent jackbooted thugs [using the term loosely here, no taxes in Soviet Union], my mom &amp; dad would be Lebensraum fertilizer, like Gramps is.


No, I wouldn't. Would either vote it out of office (the way it's usually done), or pick up a janky AK and up against the wall, motherfuckers (the other way it's usually done).
But let's posit that a government is not a bunch of people we elected to serve. Let's assume they aren't us at all -- are actually *others*, are Saurian lizards, lording over us with a single aim: to collect, in the most roundabout way possible, as much of the worthless scrip that they, themselves, print as they possibly can. Because lizards have a well-developed sense of the absurd, and made up a ridiculous rule for themselves: The worthless scrip they collect only counts if, and only if, it has been first distributed to humans, and later returned to the lizard cofers under threat of violence. That is to say via taxes. You following? Good!
At this point, we also need posit extremely stupid lizards. Because after a mere month of working for nothing, human cattle dies out. Starves, due to no money to spend on food. Suboptimal :(
Moral: Moderation. Graze your cattle, keep it happy; don't slaughter heifers before they're fat; feed them well and let them breed and raise their young, and the seventh year thou shalt let [land] rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.

Right. So is it OK if you litter on my property and I rape you? Because you staying ~~at my house~~ in my contry, without paying rent, is a violation of my property rights, to be addressed by the property owner.


You do not own your land any more than you own an apartment you bought in an apartment building. You have to pay maintenance, can't party too hard, can't raise pigs in your bathtub, and you certainly can't secede from the apartment building. So if you wanna stay in your apartment, you gonna play by the rules. or sell it to someone who can &amp; GTFO.

In the alternative, if I come on over and rape your wife in her sleep, and, as soon as she's awake, take out my pecker, get dressed and leave, no harm done?


A cop asking you to pick up a piece of trash on a public street also has the same principle. You don't want to pick it up, he uses threat of force to make you. Ditto for jaywalking. Ditto for anything in the world that you don't want to do but will, because possible negative consequences. Jeesh.

No, I'm working with the definition you gave me -- thewikipedo definition, i.e. "Patents, copyrights, and trademarks are sometimes used as examples of government-granted monopolies." Ty Warner has a government-granted monopoly on Beanie Babies. As long as we both stick to the same definition, we'll know what we're talking about, and can have some semblance of a reasonable debate.

Dollars to doughnuts Mars will be colonized by one of the superpowers. 


Though Bitcoin's ~3tps max sustained throughput can easily accommodate current Mars commerce, the party ends as soon as the first Mars shopping mall opens its airlocks.
Then there's the problem of horrible ping times. The shortest distance from Earth to Mars is ~55 million kilometers, longest ~401 million kilometers. Each way. 
Anyhow, when Mars is colonized, we'll all be omnitelepaths and transact p2p psychically, instantaneously, with everyone at once.

I use a debit card. Online. Like magic, no usurious CC fees, its even possible to automate your payments :)


Because Coincheck, their payment processor, is a charity run by elves, who never charge and live on happy forest magic.
Yes, that's a big problem with power companies, chargebacks. Selling electricity is riskier than selling BTC for paypal -- CC companies always side with the buyer.


Impossible with Bitcoin, because power company could bill your Bitcoin wallet directly, and there's not a thing you can do about it. Because Bitcoin is a pull, not a push payment system.

That's impossible, unless they were stealing. Because math.


You're not 18, you're 33. If, at this age, you can't trust yourself with a CC? It's not the the CC's fault, it's yours. It's a failing, a minor personal flaw. Some people can't have a sip of wine without going on a drunken bender. This is not to say that wine is ev0l, or that never touching wine is a virtue -- they just can't handle wine.


Not ever wanting or needing to read, write, or use 'rithmetic makes me a Luddite somehow?
Look, I'm not suggesting that you can't live well without a CC, just like I live perfectly well without reading a single book, using the web, listening to music or looking at art. What I am saying is it's pretty weird to intentionally limit yourself like that. By not having a CC, you leave yourself with fewer options, you have one less tool at your disposal. That's all.

BBQcoin can also potentially replace all the businesses you listed, and your children can potentially dance to it while it saves you money. The point is it don't.


Absolutely. Which doesn't lessen the environmental impact one bit.


According to both Satoshi and common sense, Bitcoin network is secured by miners, and the cost of mining 1 bitcoin should approach the market price of 1 bitcoin.
From this, it is trivial to extrapolate that Bitcoin is literally secured by the sum total of electricity &amp; the cost of bitcoin mining gear.
So yeah, if the world starts using Bitcoin, and Bitcoin prices rise, so would Bitcoin-the-network's total power consumption. Q.E. fuckin' D.

All you have to do to have a gun pointed at your head is throw a Coke can on the ground. When the cop asks you to pick it up you, being an edgy freeman, naturally tell him to stop harshing on your freedomz and fuck off, he tries to stop you, you, naturally, take a swing and ...gun to your head.
Yeah, they shoot you in US for littering. Duh.

Yeah, it does. For too many reasons to count, but I'll start you off.
If your net worth is a penny, increasing your net worth a hundredfold, in a day, is no big deal -- people often find dollar bills in the street. 
If your net worth is $100, increasing it x100 in a day is more of an event, because finding $10,000 in the street happens less often.
If your net worth is a trillion dollars, you can pretty much forget about increasing your net worth a hundredfold, because metaphysical impossibility; not enough money in the world for that.

"In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power to charge overly high prices."
Are you still good with this? Still wikip, a monopoly doesn't always mean a single seller, merely a business that is sufficiently successful to be a significant market power.


Of course you don't have to, you're free to ignore questions you don't wish to answer. Especially if answering them would force you to face the untenability of your position. 
Littering is wrong, so is shooting people in the face for lulz. One is, arguably, worse than the other. You've asked me to justify something that I directly stated was an irrational kink. And here you are, refusing to answer which is worse -- getting raped or a smack in the face :|
Now, either you think that one is worse than the other, or you do not. Which is it?


You haven't "fallen behind" on your rent, you think that you literally don't have to pay it. And the gubermint isn't trying to stick a coke bottle up your ass, it's asking you to pay your fucking rent or GTFO of the ~~house~~ country. See the difference? 
You feel justified in going off on crazyasss hyperbole, equating being made to pay your bills with gubermint forcing you to have sex, and claim I'm twisting words? 


But comparing taxes to rape is honky dory.


But you feel that having pornos is your natural, God-given right, like living in US without paying taxes. You tell the guy behind the counter to stop raping you, and let you have the pornos for free. Just like you demand to live in US for free. Duh.


But she knows that if she doesn't get your dick wet, you'll divorce her &amp; throw her out of the house.

See how that works?

Asking you to pay for your pornos is fine; forcing you to pay for them is not? 
Again, you are free to GTFO of US, surrender your citizenship, and never pay US taxes again. Nice, no? Imagine if rape victims had that choice? All you need do, to not get raped, is leave my rape dungeon? What a beautiful world this would be! 
Rape victims are seldom given such a choice; the ones who are, and choose to stay? They're not rape victims, they're twisted humiliation/degradation freaks -- masochists.


Myself, I was born in a hospital, without entering into a legally-binding contract. Therefore, I have a right to stay in that hospital without contributing to its upkeep (paying rent); being born in the hospital makes it mine.


No. I have explained to you what the deed to your property entitles you to, and what it does not. Amongst other things, it does not entitle you to stop paying property taxes. If the seller has mislead you into thinking that you can stop paying taxes on your property, said seller was less then forthright with you. He fucking lied, and you've been owned. 
You might try suing him for breach of contract, but tort cases tend to default to "would a reasonable person buying a property assume he never had to pay taxes," and, since the answer is clearly "lol, no," you'd lose.
Everything following from a false premise is trash, needs not be addressed.


But you claim that ~~living in US without paying taxes~~ watching HD pornos is your Natural Right. You're merely asserting your Natural Right to pornos. Just like you're asserting your natural right to the plot of land you claim to own. Keeping you from those pornos is a violation of your Natural Right, which is Natural because you said so. 
You refuse to believe that 


None, now that you put it that way. You deserve to have what's yours according to Natural Law, and, since Natural Law is some bullshit you made up on the fly, you deserve to have everything. For free. Because Natural Law.
Some might argue that your "Natural Law" is a bunch of untenable, mealymouthed malarkey, and that Might Makes Right is the true Natural Law, because it's literally how everything in nature works -- big fish eat little fish, the strong subjugate the weak, the fit survive while the less fit perish, etc., etc., but that don't fit into our greedy hippy scheme of things, so artless, so let's not go there, amirite?

Such a defeatist attitude :( Only if you're weak and are an insignificant minority, Killer. In the scenario you've presented, "[gubermint] raising the tax percent to 99.999% or even a 100%], you wouldn't be. A minority, that is.

Again, I do not. There are two possibilities:

2. I use a light client, meaning I rely on full nodes, "zombie" or otherwise, to tell me if the money BFX is sending me is Monopoly money. 
In either case, your node doesn't matter, it's unreachable.

Your wallet is full of gift cards (open payment channels with Landlord, PGE, etc.), all prefunded with what you think you're likely to spend.

Yes, I seriously feel the need to ask this question. Please answer it, before this degenerates into more walls of text.


Yes, *public* property rights. You refusing to pay taxes is violation of property rights. Not all property is owned by a single individual, there are also legal persons, such as corporations, or countries.


No, you got the analogy wrong. I'm not comparing your littering to rape; I'm also not comparing you living at my house, without paying rent, to rape. I'm comparing *making you pick up your litter* to rape. 
In other words, a cop telling you to pick up the litter you tossed in the street? he's like a rapist! Because he knows that you don't want to ~~sex him~~ pick it up, and uses threat of force to make you do it. Threat of force is the underlying principle to both rape and being forced to pick up your trash. Don't know how much simpler I can make this.

I further suggested that I would, unflinchingly, resort to violence if you nonviolently stole from me, e.g. lived at my house without paying rent, ate my food, and refused to leave.
In other words, unless we know WTF we're talking about, this is not gonna get us anywhere.

It's all ridiculously interconnected and complicated (no need for shitloads of cheap gasoline when everything runs on coal, everything runs on coal because no cheap gasoline), it all has to steep, incubate, develop, to grow, for symbiotic systems to emerge. I guess that's what I was driving at.

No. The Bitcoin network is a collection miners, who get paid for participating and provide a service (without them Bitcoin would be impossible), of non-mining nodes (~5k full nodes), and endpoints (those who run a client without relaying -- like yourself). These are listed here in order of importance. Without miners, Bitcoin would simply be impossible. [Honest] non-mining nodes secure the network by probabilistically countering malicious non-mining nodes, and by extending/expanding Bitcoin's functionality (SPV clients on smartphones and laptops). Endpoints (SPV clients, your non-relaying client) provide a user base, making Bitcoin more valuable.

By littering on my property, you violated my property rights. If I'm allowed to use force in self-defence, why not rape? Rape, according to you, is bad because instance of force. Or are there some subtle nuances in play here, something I'm not aware of?


Correct, the property was handed down via a legal contract, the body of US tort law. Much like you would distribute your vast estate, via a legal contract called "a will," to anyone you feel is entitled to it.
Regardless of the murky legal fundament of US land ownership, one thing is perfectly clear -- the owner is not *you.* You do not own the land you call yours, you merely were granted certain rights, by my jackbooted friends, on the use of that land. We can still take it from you, because eminent domain.
And all this holds even if we overlook the fact that you've purchased stolen property, land which wasn't my freedom-loving forefathers' to sell.

Lol, you do know that banks don't simply dispense paper money, correct? They underwrite -- they give you loans to buy a house or a car or a factory, that sort of thing.
Now, paper money is getting phased out -- it's not intrinsic to fiat or banking. Fiat transactions could be done digitally much faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. And more than 3 transactions per second, too, because actually scales.


Again, that's for paper money -- stuff that you can transact with without any intermediaries like banks, literally hand it to Pedro and get your bundle. Without internet; without an iPhone; anywhere, p2p. 
Bitcoin simply has nothing analogous. Cash, too, is getting phased out, and that's why you don't see them armored trucks as often as you once did. Huzzah!


Makes absolutely no difference how many bitcoins were mined; no more than your next coin flip is influenced by the previous ones. What's your point? That I should have said (block_reward + tx_fees_in_block)? Yeah, as reward drops, those tx fees are gonna be pretty pricey, or security will drop :|

Of course. And pigs like cheese. Both of these undisputed facts are irrelevant to your argument. Your logic is frightening; subpar, even by this sub's standards. 
To restate: I never argued against fiat, its success, or suggested that BTC is better. What I *did* object to is the inane notion that USD has value because it's "redeemable by its issuer."

Same deal with your country. You didn't opt-in if you were born there (as you were born into your family). Or, if you you came on over, you did. 
And you are correct, "staying could reasonably be construed as consent."


Correct, running away from home to spite your father also has associated costs, like having to find a job and another place to live. Which is not to say that your father must either let you stay out all night doing hookers and blow, or buy you a new appartment.


Your GF is not responsible for finding you a new GF if you "secede."
Your family is not responsible for you finding you a new family if you "secede." 
Your country is not responsible for finding you a new country if you "secede." It is not Obama's fault if no other country wants you, or that the world is not a soft and fuzzy place where you can "become your own private sovereign." 
Similarly, it is not your father's fault that Billy's family also has rules. So the fact that running away and moving in with Billy won't make your life better (because Billy's dad is just as bad) is not your dad's fault.

See, you're the one who attributes all that negative shit to monopolies. Ty Warner is the only guy who can legally make Beanie Babies, he has a monopoly on making Beanies. This monopoly is explicit, and that's OK -- other companies can still make soft, cuddly toys which may or may not become extremely valuable to crazy people.


When doing business with me, I can ask you to pay me in rutabagas. Or turnips. Or bitcoin. Or tokens that I, myself, mint (my company scrip). This does not make me a monopoly. 
Yes, you do have to pay your taxes in USD and not love poems, finger paintings, opinions, or other things that you feel are extremely valuable. Why do you think that is?

The underlying message is he's not interested in issuing more shares for the sake of growth. Sound strategy, just like I'm not suggesting we should issue another 50 million bitcoins, even though this might raise Bitcoin's market cap. What did you think it is?

The planned economy argument is about your brilliant "If banksters weren't banking, they could do useful work."
I pointed out that a similar argument is made by advocates of planned economy, who feel that ...what was that phrase you used? ...the most precious resource of all -- human capital? yeah, I think that's it (and also the somewhat less precious resource of all -- money) ...currently wasted on advertising and competition between redundant companies could be spent more productively.

I've made no such assertion; pointed out that it doesn't fit into the most common definition of monopoly, i.e. when most people speak of monopolies, they don't mean seignorage. You forgot that you disagreed that Ty Warner had a monopoly on making Beanie Babies, because, while it fit the wikip definition of government-granted monopoly, you wished to go with a more restrictive, or, as you put it, "common," definition.
But you're correct, seignorage could fit *a* definition of monopoly, as could "giant pangolins have a monopoly on making other giant pangolins." Which brings us back to 
1. Define what you mean by "monopoly' (because you don't like the wikip definition, while failing to provide a concise alternative).
2. Tell me if you feel monopolies are inherently wrong (e3v0l).


Because "Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word "dollar" and the motto "Trust in God," similar to the "In God We Trust" that appears on U.S. coins."
TL;DR: he made Beanies, among doing a bunch of other shit.


I'm not arguing morals. Morals are subjective, I have mine, you [presumably] got yours. Western morals are rooted in religion, are Judeo-Christian values. From a dispassionate, objective perspective, rape is no more abhorrent than a punch in the face. I [irrationally] am angered by rape, but, like the rest of my feels, this is not something that lends itself to rational debate. 


It may surprise you to know that most rapes are purely nonviolent -- from "date rape" to statutory rape (convincing loli with reason and incentivising them with candies that letting you diddle them &amp; not telling mommy is in their rational self-interest).


No, taxation is making you pay your fucking rent, you deadbeat. Because pay or GTFO. That's what taxation is analogous to -- living in an apartment and having to pay rent. Jeesh...


Explained uptheread, it's my Judeo-Christian historical baggage, which, in turn, is likely rooted in rapes often resulting in undesirable pregnancies, thus being much more of a headache than a simple punch in the face (pure, unalloyed force). Also social norms, like wearing pants when out in public and using the salad fork for salad; meat fork for meat. Some men also value virginity, considering non-virgin brides "damaged goods"; some attribute value to race purity -- births resultant of rape are difficult to pedigree.
I sorta find it odd that you ask me to [rationally] justify something I've conceded to being irrational ["a kink"]. Irrational shit is immune, by definition, to rational analysis, but I've humored you.
Your turn: Tell my why you feel that rape is worse than a beating. I'm sure you've given this plenty of thought, given your preoccupation with rape.


Not to belabor the point, but I have an [admittedly irrational] aversion to rape. That said, not letting your mate boink you is a valid, accepted cause for divorce. In other words, diddle me, or GTFO of my expensive house. 
But yourself, you feel I should let you live at my house, eat my food, and leave your pubes in my razor for nothing? 
I'm not allowed to ask you to contribute to rent or GTFO?  Asking you to pay your rent constitutes rape? What fresh craziness is this?


Everything is forcing someone to do something they don't want. A guy at the checkout counter forces you to pay for your pornos, which you do not want to do. You tell him that you don't want to pay for your pornos, that forcing you to pay for them is tantamount to, nay, *is* rape. He politely replies that if you don't want to pay for your pornos, put them the fuck back &amp; GTFO of the pornshop. But if you want those pornos, you're gonna have to pay for them. Regardless of it being rape.
Analogously, if you want to live in my house, you gotta contribute to rent, and if you wanna live in US, you gotta pay taxes. Or get the fuck out. 
Why is this so difficult to get across?


Yes, they did, good on them. Exactly how I would treat you if you steal shit from me, without ever threatening me with violence.

That's not what a full node does; as far as Bitcoin network is concerned, a node that doesn't transmit new transactions from users to miners and broadcast new blocks from miners to other nodes might as well be a turnip. It might help the guy running it to not lose his own coin because light client got duped (happened exactly never, AFAIK), but doesn't help the network. That's why it's not counted.

As I said,


The IRS is obligated to *accept my USD*, because legal tender, but nothing sets the rate. 
In other words, Alice has issued me some IOUs, which Bob [not Alice, because IRS hasn't issued the IOUs -- the FED did] is obligated to honor. But IOUs are denominated in IOUs, and while Bob will redeem them, there's absolutely no telling for how much. If USD crashes, I'll be making a million bucks an hour, and my taxes [number of IOUs I owe IRS] would be half a million. 
See the problem?
There's plenty more, like the fact that far less $$$ is needed to pay IRS than $$$ in existence, which, according to common sense, should rapidly diminish $$$ value, but it's a start :|

But hitting you in the face is OK? How come is that? Are there different types of force, some good, some bad?


I've already explained, but will again:
Once upon a time, our freedom-loving forefathers came upon a weak, fragmented society of Godless savages, heathens ignorant of Natural Law. They didn't think they owned the land they lived on, because they were stupid. So we killed most of them, via application of force, and took it from them. Now it's our property.
We (me and my fellow jackboots) allow you to buy chunks of it, like we allow you to buy an apartment in an apartment building. This land is "yours" just like "your" apartment, where you need to pay maintenance and play by the rules -- you need to pay taxes and play by the rules. Forever. So a deed to your [stolen] land gives you certain rights, but not others. Depending on the location, you may not have the right to build a whorehouse, or a factory, or a pink skyscraper; you may not be able to graze cattle, selling crack may be vorboten. 
If there's still something you don't get, don't hesitate to ask.

Only by those who wish to be wrong. Gold is neither a currency nor is it deflationary. 
Depending on context, the word "inflation" can mean one of two things: money supply inflation (printing filthy fiat toilet paper), or price inflation (a gallon of milk costs more today than it did 5 years ago). 
Gold fails both: There's more "above-ground" gold today than there was 5 years ago; an ounce of gold buys less than it did 5 years ago.

If you're tasking "is Bitcoin divisible enough to make sub-satoshi micropayments," the question is moot -- each on-chain micropayment will cost about [15,820 satoshis]( (0.08$).

Keeping water hot requires almost no energy. A thermos (vacuum flask) loses very little heat, so a 1W element will certainly keep a gallon of water near boiling, you'll need to install a thermostat to shut it off, so the water won't boil away.

Not if you mean what I think you do. Think of payment channels as gift cards (or store credit), that might help. In that context, you're asking if you can use your Bob gift card to buy a McD gift card, which you can not -- you need actual money. 
Caveat: Bob might have a McD gift card (an open and funded payment channel vis-a-vis McDonald's), and you may convince Bob to deduct the price of a Big Mac from your Bob gift card, pay for the Big Mac with his McD gift card, and give you the Big Mac.

No. Bitcoin doesn't let me buy a $5 book or $30 hat from someone thousands of miles away, not unless I want to pay too much money for any old hat or any old book. Because most people don't take Bitcoin. And here's one of the reasons why:
Bitcoin allows you to send BTC to someone thousands of miles away, trustlessly, without any third parties, and without the possibility of charheback. Sadly, that's not enough for buying things from someone thousands of miles away. 
Because when people say "buy," they tend to mean "pay money to get product," not simply "pay money and wait, like an idiot, for the product that never comes." Which is what would have happened if you've sent Bitcoin to the fifteen-year-old thai thief. 
And that's the reason PayPal charges exorbitant rates: because people steal from each other, and PayPal makes sure they don't steal from *you*. 


So this is a blast from the [distant] past? Perhaps check out how things are now, before solving thrice-solved problems with bitcoins?

Bitcoin's current revenue is mainly block rewards. This revenue has been 50BTC/10 mins at the start, 25Btc/10 mins before the halvening, and 12.5BTC/10 minutes now. Did I say 12.5BTC? Lol, sorry, it's 12.9BTC. Because an extra 0.39BTC in fees. Lol. 


It is. As long as demand stays the same, the fees won't grow for another 3.5 years, at which point they'll skyrocket due to next halvening. If demand increases, the fees will go up, at which point it'll drop again.

PoW doesn't establish trust, it merely makes really expensive money. Imagine a hundred dollar bill that cost the government $99 to print, because it's mindbogglingly labor-intensive? Yeah, that's Bitcoin: The cost of mining 1BTC approaches the market price of 1BTC. Satoshi. *Of course* no one would counterfeit it. The problem comes when all the coins are mined, there's 21 million B with dollar value of, say, 1 trillion dollars, and no one wants to mine it (secure the network with PoW), because no one wants to pay $50 tx fee every time they use it. The fewer people are willing to pay $50 per tx, the higher the tx fee has to be for [non-nefarious] miners to break even, so $500, $5,000, etc.

Yeah, that's exactly what it is -- miners' revenue. "Seignorage" is a fancy word for revenue (profit) made by minting coin.


No. Block reward has halved, miners can't afford to mine at a loss, they hike fees. 


Why would users want to join the network, if using Bitcoin is more expensive than using alternate forms of payment? For fees to stay the same, you're stuck with current userbase. More users = more tx to be included in each block, and blocks already 86% full. So fees will go up until Bitcoin's simply no longer attractive. That's the equilibrium :|

*wallet. You'll need a Lightning-enabled wallet. 
Once you have that, here's an example of how things should work. Let's say you, Andy, want to send 1 coin to Bob.
1. Open a payment channel with Bob
2. Fund it with bitcoins (make sure you fund it with more than just 1 BTC, you can't top it off yourself. Let's say 2 BTC). This happens on-chain, and takes as many confirms as any other real Bitcoin transaction. 
3. Once you have done that, and your on-chain tx was confirmed, you can pay Bob almost instantly. 
4. Once your 2 BTC is spent, or Bob needs to get at the 1 BTC you've sent him, the channel must be closed, so Bob &amp; you can cash out. This happens on the blockchain.
As long as Bob sends you the same sum of coin as you have sent Bob, and neither one of you needs to cash out, the channel can remain open indefinitely, and transactions should be nearly instant &amp; relatively cheap.

You better transfer value into the system *from outside*, 'coz that's the only way the market cap will increase. If you don't, and more coins get printed out of thin air, the value of your coin will drop, proportionately. Because simple arithmetic.
So when miners tally up their books, *of course* they count the block rewards as revenue. Because revenue is "one part of ~~bitcoin~~ economy [your pocket] transferring value to another part of ~~bitcoin~~ economy [my pocket]." That's my revenue.

If everyone's fine with not getting paid &amp; having their money tied up in Lightning channels, that's a great plan.
Unfortunately, everyone is not using Lightning, still no chicken, so still no egg, people will need to cash out if they want to pay someone (even if that means opening a payment channel).


Too pay major supplier, sounds like a routing nightmare (business -&gt; thousands of person-nodes -&gt; business). What are the mechanics (is this all worked out)? 


Sure. If all of Bitcoin is tied up in payment channels, no on-chain settlement is needed -- everyone is using Lightning. Begging the question: why Bitcoin? Who needs it, since we're all  paying each other via lightning channels?

No, BFX tells you that the hackers have your money. As do roughly 80% of Bitcoin scams.  BFX has offered exactly no evidence that it has been h4x0red. BFX has not explained how such a thing is even possible, since, prior to the "hack," BFX told its clients that it wasn't, due to the devilishly clever 2-of-3 wallet scheme it used.


Some thought that trusting BFX with their money was somewhat more secure than leaving it in Mommy's car. Were they ever wrong! Boy howdy!
If you feel that BFX provides the same level of security as your mommy's car, you're an idiot to keep *any* money there. Stop being an idiot, Mind_hardforked.


Conversely, you have the option of being an angry faggot, which you chose to exercise.

Let me turn you on to how causation works:
1. You flip a switch
2. Light goes on
Do this several times, and you will have cause to think that the light switch *causes* the light to go on. You can't be 100% sure, but it's not unreasonable to assume that flicking the light switch *causes* the light to be lit.
With me so far?
Now, if the light turns on *before* you flick that switch (even though you were going to flick it), the switch does *not* cause the light to go on. That's because causation is a temporal thing: *cause always precedes effect.* Always. That's just the nature of time and stuff.
Now, if you look at the chart, you'll see that the price rose *before* teh halvening, *not* after. From this, we can deduce that teh halvening did not cause the price rise, it was the halvening hype (which did happen before and during the price rise).

But now Disney would necessarily *NOT* get any money from those theaters. 
Or any theaters, because, bright and enterprising as I am, I'm not unique. 
Let's assume ripping/dubbing is legal. Those theaters ain't gonna watch me make a small fortune without making a few dubs themselves, because it's legal and profitable, so why not?  And they to can sell/rent them , and so on and so on.
And there I am, a dumb Disney exec, standing with my d1ck in my hand, wondering what happened to the billions I've spent on making that movie. Wondering how come my movie is running in thousands of theaters across the globe, but I only made 3 f8cking sales.

It is one of those statements repeated ad nauseam by every bitcoiner that I know. Because Bitcoin is trustless. But ... you say it ain't necessarily so?


You could, but you'd be wrong. The reason I trust my bank not to run away with my dollars like some Danny Brewster or Pirateatfourty or TradeFortress or Ukio is because *there are laws and jackbooted thugs to enforce them.* Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't have such a framework. And that's why if you don't hold the private key, your trustless p2p cash belongs to another p.

Now, this is before anything even happens -- before any transactions take place. There is no "sleep mode" for Bitcoin network -- $440,491,500 just to keep your coins safe.

**We understand that SegWit continues to be developed actively as a soft-fork and is likely to proceed towards release over the next two months, as originally scheduled.**"
Granted, the wording in that whole agreement is so weasel that literally nothing is promised (everything is "expected" and "will only be adopted with *broad support* across the entire Bitcoin community," which begs the question: why did the meeting take place and why didn't the Bitcoin community call foul with "hey, what up with this shit?

It's obvious to you that miners were gonna ~~scale down~~ "shed some unprofitable gear," but it wasn't obvious to some folks. Some thought the price would magically go up, so that miners wouldn't have to ~~scale down~~ shed unprofitable gear. And so they hodldeded like the champs they are, all the way through the halvening.

Bullshit. Please quote applicable law, because you're the first person I'm hearing this from. Honest.


The wonderful thing about (US) law is it doesn't punish you for your beliefs and opinions. As long as you don't break laws, you're good to go.

Sarcasm clearly needs tags on the internet. My intent was to draw your attention to the fact that opinions are subjective, and what's perversion to one guy could be awesome buttsecs to another. 
Therefore, while our subjective opinions play a big part in which proposals make it into law, and when those laws may be obsoleted and junked, an individual's personal ethics shouldn't play here.

First, copying is not voluntary. The copyright holders aren't agreeing to it any more than the guy whose pocket you pick is agreeing to that.
As far as drugs go, it's hard to say if there'd be more or less junkies/crackheads if both were legal. Arguably, both are bad (for the society and for junkies/crackheads themselves).

I'm a bankster, I print filthy toilet paper scrip called the USD. The scrip is worthless, because who wants filthy toilet paper, amirite?
Though worthless, my worthless scrip is genuine, i.e. *not* counterfeit. Because many things which are worthless aren't counterfeit -- my poop, for instance.
Now, if *you* start printing worthless filthy toilet paper scrip called the USD, "made to look like an exact copy of [my USD] in order to trick people"? Yeah, your copy of my USD, that's counterfeit.
And now you're a little bit closer to grasping the meaning of the word counterfeit, and why simply opening a dictionary, without reading, ain't enough.

You must be super old. The USD is not a silver certificate, it is not backed by silver or gold, that ended a long time ago, middle of the last century.
"Silver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968
Finally, President Richard Nixon announced[7] that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards."

The article focused on BoA, that's what I have been talking about. Didn't realize we were totalling the cost of running the world finance to the cost of running Bitcoin, with its 10 billion dollar "market cap" and 7 transaction per second burst rate. Shall we try?
On the Bitcoin side, I have not included everything either. I have not included Bitcoin ATMs, Bitcoin exchanges, BitPay, etc., etc. -- all the Bitcoin companies trying to provide bank-like services. 


Not sure I follow. Why? Bitcoin is secured with PoW, the cost of mining one BTC should approach the cost of production, according to Satoshi. If it costs 1,800 BTC a day to secure 15.7 million BTC, why would it cost less to secure 21 million BTC, regardless of how much 1 BTC costs?

I could expand on this, but I'm kinda afraid of pissing off Mr. Godwin.


1. I do not know anyone, in Bitcoin or Etherium, who runs a full node. That said,
2. Unless you feel that only 5,500 humans use Bitcoin, most bitcoiners don't run full nodes either.
3. Etherium, while having a smaller market cap and (arguably) a smaller user base, has 8,769 nodes.

Justice is not a discipline, you're thinking of law. Deferring to wise wikipedos, who are much smarter than us, "The concept of justice differs in every culture." Justice is, clearly, both culturally-bound and subjective. There is nothing to suggest that there is one single, universal justice.  Sarcasm aside, a good place to start: 


So we're quibbling over semantics? What shall we call it? "Making millions of dollars a year by operating a torrent site?" Doesn't quite roll of the tongue.
Theft is not intrinsically unethical. If a mother steals a candy bar to feed her starving kid, she did something illegal, punishable by law, but not immoral. 
~~Stealing~~ torrenting a cracked copy of Windows for the same kid, because education and stuff? Meh, but who hasn't?
~~Stealing~~ torrenting MP3s? further into the black, but again, who hasn't?
Now, getting millions a year from a torrent website? For me, morally untenable.
Is that what you're driving at?

Aha, I was right. You really do have no idea of what rape is or how it works. You think ugly people who don't get laid are rapists.


Because, going with your ugly rapist bit, it's important for me to teach my pretty Honeymuffin to be nice to ugly people, and to know that good looks could be a curse in some situations. Because, as I have found out today, ugly people, if they don't get laid, rape. And when they rape, they rapoe pretty people.
So I'd want Honeymuffin to maybe give an ugly guy a tuggy once in a while, so he could tell his ugly friends [who are also rapists because don't get laid] that my Honeymuffin is OK, and maybe they won't rape her as often.
So now you know :)

So the answer is Disney. Disney gets hurt, while I make the money that Disney would have made. And Disney goes out of business, and now we only have old and shitty movies, because making good movies is expensive and doesn't pay.

Bitcoin is a social experiment. Fees are a part of how Bitcoin works. Miners spend boatloads of money to secure the Bitcoin network and make it functional. Currently, they are subsidized by block rewards: 12.5 BTC every ~11 minutes. This is not enough, because they were getting 25 BTC last month, so the hashrate is falling (Estimated Next Difficulty:	197,184,225,918 (-7.64%)) 
Transaction fees are meant to subsidize the miners (pay them for the service they provide). This is nothing new.
Arguably, it's way too soon to start relying on fees, but that's a different topic.

TL;DR: They can issue up to 250,000 x €1,000 of these "instruments."

Aha, I see where you're going. Exchanges don't trade on chain, just like I don't use Visa to move money from my left pocket to the right one. 
When people say Visa network can handle X transactions per second, that's exactly what that means. X doesn't include all the "off-chain" transactions, like exchange engines or me moving coins from pocket to pocket. 
So yeah, Bitcoin currently tops out at 7 transactions per second, or about 3 TPS sustained.

Drugs are a product, like widgets a factory makes. You buy drugs, you eat drugs, smoke drugs, snort drugs, boot drugs or shove them up your butt, and things don't seem as bad as they really are.

Unlike drugs, fiat money (which is what all the cash in the world today is) is what the folks here refer to as worthless government scrip, toilet paper. Not product. Not like drugs. The only thing that gives it value is others will take it from you, and give you things in return: gasoline, baby formula, a crack rock you can torch.
That shit will immediately stop if the hundred $ bill is made illegal. Your option would be to get $100 for it from your bank, and then use your bank card to buy $100 worth of baby formula (which you could then trade for crack), or keep it, which would be a mistake. Because that hundred-dollar bill would become as valuable as a hundred Zimbabwean dollars, which is to say not at all. It would be a pretty piece of paper for you to play with or collect.
And now you know that cash is fiat, and illegal fiat isn't fiat, it's bunk.

I can assure you that he does not. Grandpa is making a funny, just like the girl in question. Only Grandpa doesn't suffix his jokes with "Lolz." Because he's old.
Yes, the girl works for money, in her case that money happens to be GBP. She is disappointed in GBP, saying that *even Bitcoin, the Gold Standard of volatility, is better than GBP.*
This is an exaggeration used to make a point, or sarcasm if you wish. It's funny because everyone knows that in reality, GBP, as volatile as it is, is nowhere close to Bitcoin's volatility.
Please don't make me explain any more jokes, mine or other people's. Because that's embarrassing for everyone involved.

BTC dollar price move more than 100% pretty much every year. Now, me and Gramps don't follow the GPB that closely, could you point to the last time GPB did that?
BTC price is so unstable that *most of the merchants who accept it price their goods in USD, convert the price at checkout, and give you a 10 minute window to pay, before the price changes.* 
10 minutes before the price changes. Let that sink in. 
No, not yet. A bit longer. Let that really sink in.

1. You are not familiar with Bitcoin and/or GBP
2. Your definition of volatility is ... *unique*

But that's not what we're talking about, i don't think. There are plenty of ways to migrate a forum, I think there are websites that mirror "pre-deletion" reddit (I might be wrong).
What I'm interested in is a way for everyone, with different viewpoints/different moderation requirements, to share the same data (database, "all posts ever posted"). Without the need to maintain separate copies. 
This does rely on a third party keeping the database/not manipulating the data, but we're talking forum posts, not launch codes. I'm willing to trust reddit, for instance, not to mess with my posts. I'm even willing to trust theymos not to mess with my posts, if we came to an agreement. Maybe even Roge, even Brian.

Herein lies the rub: Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment processor. As a payment processor, it is mindnumbingly limited, being able to handle roughly the transaction volume of a large US shopping mall on a slow week day. But not weekend, and forget about holidays.
Unless you hold the private key, you do not have the bitcoin.
This can not be repeated often enough. What happens on Coinbase is Coinbase moving its coins around. They're controlled by Coinbase, they don't even move to another address -- it's all on paper, think Excel worksheet. The coins do not move, no new addies are generated, no new keys, so we're only talking about how fast Coinbase's trade engine is able to manipulate numbers. Internal accounting.
Why is this even an issue?
What happens off-chain is no more Bitcoin transactions than what happens in an Excel worksheet is Visa transactions. I can script a console app to move a million dollars a million times per second from one account to another, both on my computer. That's what is happening on Coinbase. 
Oh yeah, forgot the currency part. As a unit of account, Bitcoin is basically unworkable due to volatility. Unworkable to the extent that nearly every place that accepts it prices its goods in actual money, arriving at the BTC price by converting, at current exchange rate, at the time of sale.

If by "cost effective," you mean spending $10k on a 3D printer, and by "self defence tools," you mean an unwieldy exploding plastic glob with probably about 200fps muzzle velocity, i.e. more likely to hurt you than your attacker? Well, I guess we're on the same page.
Protip: How about lying down %1 of that money for a real gun? Might live a bit longer.


Then what are we talking about? Yes, you can walk into into any gun shop, gun show, and many pawn shops, and buy yourself a sub-$100 handgun. And I do mean something that can shoot more than one shot before reloading, will drop the guy on the wrong end of it, and not blow your hand off.
That's if we're talking self-defence in us. I'm pretty sure they won't let you buy "80% lowers" in opressive dictatorships like Germany, which is what this thread is about. I could be wrong.


Only skilled people with money *ARE* able to make guns. Even if you consider the Cody thing a gun, you need $10,000 3D printer to make it. With a $500 lathe and a $1k vertical mill, I can make a real shitty one-shot, out of metal. In less time than the plastic one takes to print. Which won't explode in your hands :)

Well no. Say you started writing checks/wiring money to an illegal gambling site from your personal bank account. Do you suppose that sort of thing would go over well? No, no it would not. And yet that's exactly what you are doing with Bitcoin's distributed public ledger, immutable and accessible to all. That's Bitcoin's blessing and curse. There is no plausible deniability for Coinbase. They can't say "how were we supposed to know he was funding an illegal gambling site?" The answer would be "Look at the blockchain, it's in the wiki."

Each post has an extra byte, and each mod can "delete" a post by flipping "his" bit, like so: 
Mod 1 deletion: 1111 1110
Mod 2 deletion: 1111 1101 etc.
The user simply turns on the appropriate bitmask to see the moderation of 1, 2, 3, none, or all 3. Just like filtering.
More mechanics could be added (how replies from "moderated user-&gt;non-moderated user, etc.)

We who seek actual freedom think that when one baby gets born into a fortune, while the other baby gets nothing but Mom's dope habit, babies gonna fight. 


Dialectic can not be "false" -- it's a process. Like so:
((Thesis vs. Antithesis) -&gt;Synthesis) vs. next Antithesis) -&gt;Synthesis, etc.
Thesis and antithesis could both be false, that's the gimmick.

It's not always about money. Are you cool with your private messages, the sort that could mean srs tiem, getting released to The Man?
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:03:31
Possibly... Any particular reason?

Let me see if I follow: A failing economy has a failing fiat currency, therefore fiat is fail.
There are 723 cryptos listed here: 
Care to guess how many are not failing?

oic! All I needs to do is expose my identity, register a front business, set up an account with a CC processor, pay the usurious CC fees, face chargebacks and experience ungodly payment delays, and then pay ~~taxes~~ off the jackbooted thugs? 
And all my customers would have to do is buy prepaid CC at a premium?
You're right, much simpler than running a TOR hidden service, pasting a QR code and start accepting Bitcoin. 
I feel so foolish...

If not malicious ruinators and spreaders of poisonous disinformation, why were Big Block Shills banished from our sandbox? To foster decentralization?  
And tell me, how is Bitcoin less centralized than Etherium? My understanding of Etherium is pretty superficial, so clue me in.

How so? I'll go down the list, point by point, and explain how everything listed relies on a middleman far less than the Bitcoin equivalent.
1. Cash. 
Cash is a token, like bitcoin. I do not need anyone other than the person who knows what cash is to transact. I take a ten-dollar bill out of my pocket, hand it to pedro, and get my stuff. Bitcoin?  I need to rely on my phone/internet provider, Pedro's phone/internet provider, and all the miners in China :(
2. The Marketplace. 
See above. I do not even need to use cash, I can use turnips, or BBQ coins, or valuable Magic: The Gathering cards.
3. See "no one uses."
4. Lending money to friends: see (1) and (2). The bank is never involved when I ask Pedro to front me the stuff: Just Pedro and I :)
If you have any issues with the above, I'm happy to elaborate.
Edit: as far as platforms like OpenBazaar, you *explicitly* rely on a third party: the escrow, or whatever they're calling the third in 2 out of 3.

Nodes *are* countable. That's a natural fact. One person could be behind multiple nodes, but that's a different issue altogether.


It's a tricky thing to define, that's why it's a tricky thing to measure.


Sure. To what end?
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:33:22
Not sure I see the logic here. Are you saying Bitcoin *doesn't* make it easier to monetize and buy child porn? It's simpler to buy it with PayPal/Visa?

You're looking for an exchange willing to give you a $25k/day line of credit? That you can instantly cash out into a BTC addy you control? Or you have some good CC Not sure I understand.

No, but obsessing about a non-native speaker's word choice is. The pettiest, most cringeworthy kind of pedantry.
Thanks for letting me have the last word tho.
