My suggestion doesn't require bitcoin transactions. If we insist, we can even avoid revealing the public key of the address (see zkSNARK remark).

More people should at least see this suggestion. The users do have a word in this debate, and that's a good way to speak it out.

Just in case, I paste here the nlocktime howto:
Can be used for offline and online setups.
 
local libbitcoin explorer.
 
[local install on linux]
wget 
chmod a+x bx-linux-x64-mainnet
ln -s bx-linux-x64-mainnet bx
 
To make things simple, lets assume all the funds we want to lock are in an address which has only one output.
The corresponding private key is in the file "private.key" on our offline setup.
 
[on offline setup - get correct public key for corresponding address - just try both options]
    # uncompressed pubkey #
    PUBKEY_UNCOMPRESSED=`cat private.key | bx wif-to-ec | bx ec-to-public -u`
    ORIG_ADDR=`echo $PUBKEY_UNCOMPRESSED | bx ec-to-address`
    echo $ORIG_ADDR                                                              
    1CXy4vFBVDaZdEcVVJ2UfM4YKr75kXUU6g
 
    # compressed pubkey #
    PUBKEY_COMPRESSED=`cat private.key | bx wif-to-ec | bx ec-to-public`
    ORIG_ADDR=`echo $PUBKEY_COMPRESSED | bx ec-to-address`
    echo $ORIG_ADDR                                                              
    1CRhm6teNdoQGN18KR167kypyKiidkByij
 
     this case, uncompressed:
    echo $ORIG_ADDR
    1CXy4vFBVDaZdEcVVJ2UfM4YKr75kXUU6g
    PUBKEY=$PUBKEY_UNCOMPRESSED
    DECODED_ADDR=`echo $ORIG_ADDR | bx address-decode | grep payload | awk -F ' ' '{ print $2 }'`
    echo $DECODED_ADDR
    7e84aa51caf9a2fb23f35f2bbeda007ee334ea8c
 
[on online setup]
Verify that the address has a single output (single line results):
 
    PREV_HASH=`bx fetch-history $ORIG_ADDR | grep hash | awk -F ' ' '{ print $2 }'`
    echo $PREV_HASH
    3b4ab2ff91d6b794786f13f5cf1a34c635ad33986a36f1e41281b285cea6f0bf
 
    PREV_INDEX=`bx fetch-history $ORIG_ADDR | grep index | awk -F ' ' '{ print $2 }'`
    echo $PREV_INDEX
    3
 
    PREV_VALUE=`bx fetch-history $ORIG_ADDR | grep value | awk -F ' ' '{ print $2 }'`
    echo $PREV_VALUE
    100000
 
    # build raw transaction
    NEW_ADDR=1BJ8YqhHimFrHhjhT5vvCb3UYHLFtK1U5m
    MINER_FEE_SATOSHI=10000
    UNLOCK_BLOCK=360000
    RAW_TX=`bx tx-encode -i $PREV_HASH:$PREV_INDEX:0 -o $NEW_ADDR:$(($PREV_VALUE-$MINER_FEE_SATOSHI)) --lock_time $UNLOCK_BLOCK`  
    CONTRACT="dup hash160 [ $DECODED_ADDR ] equalverify checksig"
 
[on offline setup]
    EC_PRIVATE_KEY=`cat private.key | bx wif-to-ec`
    SIGNATURE=`bx input-sign $EC_PRIVATE_KEY "$CONTRACT" $RAW_TX`
    SIGNED_TX=`bx input-set  "[ $SIGNATURE ] [ $PUBKEY ]" $RAW_TX`
    # verify that the tx was built well
    echo $SIGNED_TX | bx tx-decode
 
[on online setup - validate]
    bx validate-tx $SIGNED_TX
or paste in 
send tx per email or publish on reddit/pastebin
 
The transaction should be published when lock time passes - paste on  or bx send-tx $SIGNED_TX or some similar way.
 
On request (donation) - I can write unlocktime bot (like remindmebot) with the syntax:
unlocktime! $SIGNED_TX
It will publish your transaction on the right time.

My solution avoids spending coins. It only shows that you vote with your stack towards a certain direction. Colored coins are irrelevant here.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:46:22
But that already means a war - ledger split. We would really prefer to avoid it.
If 80% vote to one direction, this may just be enough.

The developers duty is to give the best technical reasoning behind their solution. The users are those to listen to all the technical explanations and decide what's best for their fortune. This vote may help developers understand what the users think. It is one important input which is now missing.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:34:08
no need to spend anything by voting. you just have to own coins at a certain block height (360000). The bitcoin protocol protects you from attacks, just like it protect your coins.
It is not that the rich decide. It is those that believe in bitcoin decide. If you "risk" 100 coins, I would like to listen to your opinion more than to one that risks 1 coin.
