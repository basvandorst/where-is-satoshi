Good for your customer but bad for your business. When you said this my first thought was: “why shouldn’t some one buy a few miners, use them for 20-25 days and return them.”
maybe instead of selling you could rent out the units for x amount of money a month and once they reach the $4k payment you let them kept it or something?

There’s a malware which detects bitcoin addresses on your clipboard and then replaces it with its own address.

Sell low buy high
E: 
actually think about this: should you risk selling right now because as people wake up they will panic sell when they see their loses? Or should you invest more money in hopes that when people wake up they will see it as an investment opportunity? Or do you just simply hodl? The choice is yours.
Personally I’ve been up all night waiting to sell off some stuff  in hopes people will panic sell and I can rebuy more. But seeing this sudden upward trend is making me want to just hodl.

I consider it not over till we hit 20k+. I bet a lot of 18-19k buyers will sell at 19-20k out of fear of a big dip again.

When I buy from your site am I guaranteed a working miner? I’m asking because if it isn’t working even a free RMA would king of ruin the investment since difficulty is always going up and who knows what the bitcoin price will be in 1-2 weeks.
