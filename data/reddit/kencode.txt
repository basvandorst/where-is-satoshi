The BTS blocks are set at 3 seconds right now, but they could bump it down to 1sec if the DPOS ( voters were to vote it in. The Bitshares blockchain can already handle thousands of transactions per second ( but I think Dan Larimer had hinted recently at crosschain "infinite tps with sub-second confirmations". Currently though, even at a 10K tps burst recently, you need some pretty fat network infrastructure to support anything higher than that right now. 
 
Dan Larimer goes on: "100K TPS requires over 10 MB/sec of network bandwidth and servers with 32 cores and 256 GB of RAM. The transaction history will grow at 1000 GB per day.  None of these issues are problems when we have network income of 1 billion dollars per day (assuming 100K per sec $0.20)."
 
I still don't see any other blockchains proving those kind of numbers. Their current wallet is kinda ugly IMO ( but once you get used to the 3sec blocks, it's hard to look back again.

bids for one, with design and fab all came in between 500k and 2m. now when we go to mass production, thats where there series b funding has to come in getting the pricepoint down for the customer. i was in shock when i found out it would be 2mil, plus they make us sign an agreement to continue with them and such. plus, if you want ARM for instance, the price was 5 times the amount, plus extra fees just to use their frign name. samsung was about the same.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:26:47
Yep, the mining isnt as easy because of the cpu overhead but the farming has a wicked small footprint. we want the owner to be able to farm out most of the sys resources when not in use. im a big believer in crypto currencies too so thats why i insisted on it. creating the custom asic costs about 1.5mil but with all the parts weve crammed in there thusfar using off the shelf boards and sensors and such, the manufacturers assure me it is possible to the 14nm size now. crowdfunding should start in february, right now we just are seeking support for the concept. the hardest part of the ePlugs so far has been finding people who understand blockchain/crypto tech and coding for it. the web gui has a ton of features in it and we had to redesign the interface once already because our friends couldnt figure it out. the more features we added, the more confusing the interface got. working with a couple of guys offshore right now (india and romania) that are experts with single page web apps, this way the owner will never have to download anything either. its been intense so far but makin it so everyone can understand it is a whole diff story. i really think that we can defund these wars by going crypto, it might just be the kick in the nsa groin thats needed. i met with some suits yesterday who i thought were investors, maybe they were, i dunno, but they werent happy at all with what the ePlugs are going to disrupt.  
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:15:00
When series a funding is approached in march, closing by may, sending specs to the manufs, waiting, sending it back again and again, we're looking at november before anything worthwhile can even be touched. That's on a really aggressive scale too. So, by the time 2015 comes to a close, 14nm is a lot more avail and we'd then learn that we should have just started it at 14nm saving us all time and money. I want everyone to be able to afford this thing, its the only way to get mainstream acceptance of meshnet, nevermind the fqct that I'm fighting every isp and cdn on Earth along the way. Are you in the business  I'd love to pick your brain a bit more, can you recommend some manufacturers that can handle these demands? Thank you so much for your time! :) 
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:18:16

When the crowdfunding starts in february, i need to find the best site to launch it. CrowdsUnite looks like a cool syndication site, anyone here use them? What are your faves? Please and thank you :) 
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:06:51
Yeah, those guys were very unprofessional during our conversations too. They're out. We're not even in the series a round yet, not till at least march so we've got some time yet to weed these manufacturers out. I want a complete 14nm class ePlug in my hands from these guys. The first prototype doesn't even fit completely into the housing. The series a round (ive done this before so i know what to expect) will be the toughest one cuz those are the folks that are fronting the money for the ePlug that fits into everything. I know it doesnt really have to be 14nm, but i am very anal about what the ePlugs capabilities are and the wide array of switches and outlets that it will fit into. The european gang box area is easy, but american and i think it was the chinese boxes are so slim, i dont want to have to manufacture multiple versions of the board. Finding manufs that are capable of 14nm sizes and handle this level of demand is very difficult. Most of them *say* they can do it but then you lose all your investment 3mo down the road when they start informing u of this complication or that. Like i said ive lost enough times to be ready for their "surprises". Next week i have two more manuf skype calls. I am firm on 14nm, its the only way to make this thing affordable for everyone. This thread seems relatively active, so i will post updates here if you guys wouldn't mind helping me spread the word before february comes. Much appreciated  and everyone here! Cheerz! :)
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:09:44
well, what would you like to know? i cant give you chip id's, but i can tell you, and thru the faq exactly what it does. im tryin to find out if ppl are interested in something like this, its the only way i could see that we'll ever be able to get meshnet propagated and finally get off of centralized internet carriers. lmk, thanx :) 
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:12:48
everything can be hacked. esp the IoT as it sits today. just ask google. the meshnet is the free DEcentralized internet, plus, you can bridge it with your backhaul if you like. the web gui we're working on right now will be a single page web app that lets even grandma understand how to enable it. its a color coded walk you thru it style interface. i felt like it was the only way we could ever get a truly decentralized web out to everyone on earth. stick it in a frign socket, we've all got one of those :)

Spreading the word is probably 80% of the battle. Everybody every day is inundated with ads for meaningless cr*p. I am actually trying to bring everyone free unrestricted internet and virtually limitless computing power.

I think pc's, as they have been traditionally, will go the way of the dinosaur. Tiny meshnet devices like the ePlug, mobile devices, even smartphones theoretically could run a lightweight os like this. That's my goal, anyway :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:48:57
No, on a couple levels.  we don't like servers.  the ePlug is very tiny, it resides inside of electrical outlets and light switches. We didn't want to have something that say, hotel visitors could just steal or kick off the wall. This thing has to stand the test of time. Keeping it open source hardware and software was a big one for us personally too.

We want the ePlug to only have minimal data stored it, just enough to run the meshnet components and other hardware. The Whitepaper sheds a lot more light on the properties of the distributed operating system though.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:10:04
I'm VERY pro-Storj too as you'll see from our ePlug Whitepaper. From what I understand about the Factom and Storj projects, they are equally decentralized. Every BOS update that is released, will go thru the community first via github (I was hoping to use gitchain actually, but he moved on to some other projects). To learn the really in-depth stuff about Factom I'll have to refer you to their Whitepaper on Factom.org so I don't misquote anything, it gets intense though, fair warning :) 
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:26:40
I do too Vitalik. 
 
The poor coders remain compartmentalized though, told (and believing) their work will be used for decentralization, but the brass will always serve the same master.. the bottom line (&amp; Bilderberg in IBM's case). 
 
They'll lobby for human rights but backdoor us making "un-approved" encryption algos illegal. Stay on the winning team man, that's all I'm askin'- Peace :)

This assumes of course that your friend has a smartphone and is curious about Bitcoin. Just say you wanna buy their lunch..... and show them how to pay the bill with Bitcoin. 
 
* Go to lunch; They drive, YOU buy 
* Go to the app store to download and install the Mycelium wallet (or your fave) 
* Send your friend enough bitcoin to pay for lunch 
* Show them how to pay the bill with their phone 
* Thank them for buying your lunch ;) 
 
============== 
 
* When you get back home, show them how to do a backup, buy online, get more Bitcoin, work for Bitcoin, get a coinwidget or changetip address for their social pages (ie: kenCode.tip.me), etc. 
* Send your friend another couple bucks for the gas money 
* Next time, THEY buy, and so on

Updates will have their own section in the whitepaper. That has been one of my biggest concerns too. Getting consensus on pushing a new update automatically, tracking/blockcing malicious users, etc. Reputation is going to have to play a huge part in the BOS authentication and access rights. Here's some new sections that are being added to the whitepaper over the coming days, points presented by people right here on reddit: 
Stateless? Self-Healing huh? How are updates handled? How are exploits handled? Stopped? Tracked? --lots of work to do yet :) Great questions and points and gratefulness expressed so far, thank you! 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:54:18
I'd rather not look at it like it's just one user who tries to push anything to the stack, it must be approved thru community consensus first, only verified professionals with the highest reputation values. Self-checking can only be done by code that has been made smart enough by the community. Pushes can only come from the group of professionals with the highest community ratings, verified by the blockchain. Otherwise, you'd have some central group of malicious types trying to corrupt it all.

Agreed, I can't think of everything, I'm here to get everyone's thoughts on it as mentioned at the top. Reddit has a lot to offer, the number of educated folks that come in here to contribute far outweigh the number of people that I work with locally, it's strength in numbers. I want the Factom Linux BOS to be bulletproof, there's enough sharp minds in here to do it too. I've collected tons of great points in here. We're not some centralized company either, the distributed team I work with is a whopping 7 people. We code, and make, and consult, r&amp;d, we all share the roles. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:27:43
Agreed. That's why the ePlug will be the first Use Case. Totally open source hardware and software. Then if all goes well, I want to get the alpha version up on my github page so the community can start porting it to the different mobile devices as well. The nsa is screwed.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:56:24
The ePlug is no scam group. We're a distributed team of coders/makers designing a meshnet/crypto/IoT device that (we hope) will be able to fit into every electrical outlet and/or light switch on Earth. We're huge into spreading Bitcoin awareness and CryptoActivism too: 
 
 
 
lmk if you have any questions about the project, thanx :)

@_date: 2015-02-03 15:21:16
GREAT points Natanael_L  :) 
 
Every BOS update that is released, will go thru the community first via github (I was hoping to use gitchain actually, but he moved on to some other projects). I compare it to eBook files. If the Author releases an update, he pushes it to the blockchain. A sole owner, yes, BUT...
 
So, who is in charge then of pushing BOS updates to its blockchain? It should be a large group/multisig of people, consensus by the people who actually have a good reputation in the Factom Linux community. This way, no malicious user could inject bad code. To infect the kernel or any root files, consensus would have to be granted to him by the community. 
 
Reputation management is still new when it comes to blockchain tech. As for ID, my plan right now is to utilize keybase and onename, authenticate you right to the metal of a node. I know we can expand on this quite a bit in the coming months.
 
Ideas here are very welcome.

@_date: 2015-02-11 18:00:56
I TOTALLY agree with you bout the math. :) 
Honestly, I'm not sure tho on the law, there was someone else here on Reddit that brought it up. He/she was saying that we cannot legally sell shares to people in America or some other countries, I don't know. I posted a question entitled LEGAL ADVICE in the bitcoin forum a week or so ago and no law firm has even touched it. My plan is to use Bithalo or the ripple codius product or something like that, and then we could tie that into Lighthouse somehow, or just do the share disbursements manually. The first Lighthouse crowdfunding effort will be very tiny just to make sure everything works out good, Rewards get distributed properly, proof of work, etc then move onto another Lighthouse crowdfunding effort for a bit more and so on, proving each step. The shares tho will be extremely important in the end phases tho, the electrical and mechanical engineering are exorbitantly expensive, so Pledgers to that phase will need way bigger rewards, ie shares, equity. I'll let the lawyers handle all of that. Seems there's lots of controversy over that stuff right now too, so i only want to use legal platforms for the disbursement. Here's my posts on that:

Our goal is to provide the bridging functionality, accessible in the ePlug Web GUI along with tuning to any meshnet within range. As it sits right now, we can transceive up to 54Mbps in a ~3mi/5km range. Once the white space is opened up, we can connect nodes even further. The mass-production version will be able to fit inside of any electrical outlet or light switch worldwide. My goal is to get decentralized tech to every home on earth. ISP's and "cloud" providers just aren't needed any more. So, yes, it will be :) Open source hardware and software as well.  is where we keep the ePlug Whitepaper.

Well, all we can do is try. The blockchain can handle all of the auditing, the Pledgers will have the ability to participate in each (of the 10) phases of the crowdfunding and from there all I can say is that I'll do my best. As activist, I am extremely passionate about the ePlug project moreso than any other project I have ever built, and this one doesn't need 37 people to do it either. Github didn't even exist when I built my first company and the really cool thing is once we get the alphas up there people from all over the world can help out. Besides open source hardware and software, that's like the coolest part, we, as a community of believers in this project have full control over it, removing all centralized control. Ok, I'll avoid the politics, but you know what I mean :)

Hey Perkins Coie, I notice you haven't mentioned Factom in your post on Coindesk, and how that data-layer of the blockchain could totally eliminate the need for Lawyers and your Firm: 
 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:17:06
Factom provides the ability to use the Blockchain as a verification and validation service to insure that every component of the BOS is tracked, tested, and installed correctly. Factom provides the ability to identify issues, and distribute secure updates. It's the data-layer for the Bitcoin Blockchain. The Whitepaper goes into further detail, am adding more to it as we speak. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:14:46
See my comments regarding a pool of consensus reputation.  No (human) elected officials and karma. I know that prob sounds kinda "skynet-ish" but if the software is designed in a way where it could randomly snag a pool of high karma trusted users who have committed their time in a provable positive way, then those users selected could collectively say "yes, we should push this update" then an attack on the network would be real tough and if it ever was successful,  an auto rollback or fork could be used. "3 laws strong" in a sense. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:21:21

Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a little help from the University of Texas. It mimics the behavior of the magnets in conventional circulators with the help of resonators that steer the signals in the right direction so that the antenna can send and receive data at the same time producing full-duplex communication. No expensive rare earth magnets required. 
 
I want CJDNS to be an option in the Web GUI yes, along with distributed computing options with Storj and MaidSafe. The user won't have to use them, but the benefits to the user of doing so will be crypto-income (sjcx, safecoin, etc).

Agreed, every single bit of assistance in the space only stands to grow the bitcoin ecosystem even further. The mainstream media says otherwise of course. Every time we eat out I ask if they accept bitcoin. They usually say no, or not yet, or they're looking into it or whatever.. I give them a frustrated look then hand over the card, but at least they know that customers are asking for it and that trickles back to the owners.

This is a distributed operating system, one that is penetration-testing itself, self-healing and self-updating. The bitcoin blockchain verifies every shard of every file so to target one node, you'll have to crack every node on the bitcoin blockchain first.

all the more reason for me to try and get as many people as possible to try and hack it before we release it. bounty-driven of course :) 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:58:02
AI should be Consensus driven code. Github (i wish gitchain wasn't a dead project, I had high hopes for that one) will play a huge role in making the BOS a perfection driven solution. Your first point was just added to the whitepaper fyi, will be fully detailed, then uploaded replacing the current version as soon as possible. As usual I'll post the updates to my twitter account. Thank you MistakeNotDotDotDot! :) 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:59:29
I mentioned the same thing just a couple days ago. These dApps need to be platform independent, it would really speed the dev up. 
 
Any js/node/socket people out there wanna tackle it? 
I'll crowdfund it for ya.............. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:50:39
The first step is to get this running smoothly on the minimalist ePlug hardware so we can test it out on the meshnet. Then, once the alpha is done and up on github, I know tons of people who want to start porting this to every device out there. BBB's, rpi's, onion omega, vocore, espruino, arduino, etc. the nsa is screwed. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:19:42
Factom(.org) explains their technology that we are using to build this BOS. Distributed operating systems are one thing, but now we can actually secure every shard of it using the bitcoin blockchain thanx to them. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:45:21
It should always remain a work in progress, here is some more points that are being detailed in it as we speak: Stateless? Self-Healing huh? How are updates handled? How are exploits handled? Stopped? Tracked? How does it prevent buffer overflows, or malware that drops a shell script payload that downloads a file and then executes that? 
 
This subreddit is a great place to get more points that need covering in detail. I am in there now adding more and will upload new versions in the coming days. I'm also breaking it down into indexable items, ie: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. This way we can all refer to points individually. Your contributions will be added as well, just let me know what should be added thanx OX3 :) 
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:25:24
That's a great point; If you're a traveler, bitcoin will save you a ton of time and money. Just gotta make it a habit, this week you buy, next week they buy for someone, share and share alike.

Agreed, we are working on it constantly right now. Lots of awesome ideas and points popping up in this subreddit too that we are adding answers to in the whitepaper. I'll upload a new version tomorrow or next day. It'll be a work in progress as people in the community express their thoughts on this project as well.

Alright that's cool Chad. You were doing due-diligence and that is commendable. I think everybody in here will be pleasantly surprised then when they see each of the 10+ small phases get funded, completed, paid and verified by the entire community. The money won't come all at once, this is multiple phases of crowdfunding, broken up into little verifiable bits. I don't even get the money as you guys will see, I'm here to crowdfund the idea for the graphic designers and coders who actually do most of the work. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:34:58
From my understanding, Bitcoin has not been recognized by most governments as a currency yet. Therefore, it would not legally fall under SEC regs. Here in Germany it is seen as an asset, so it's declared value could be taxed. 
 
I live in Germany. The ken Code and ePlug companies are both registered here in Germany. I want to issue shares to anyone in the world who contributes to our ePlug, collected and payable only in Bitcoin.
 
Are there any experts in the Law community who can clear this up for us? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:31:44
All the more reason we need to implement community consensus with the BOS. 
 
As for the factoids, that is a question that I will have to direct you to Factom itself, they are the designers of the factoids. 
 
Penetration testing and self-healing will be fully defined in the "Definitions" section which is being added as we speak. I'll upload the latest whitepaper with all the reddit points and questions as soon as possible. here's a few points that have been asked already which we are adding right now: Stateless? Self-Healing huh? How are updates handled? How are exploits handled? Stopped? Tracked? 
 
Thanx for all the great question, keep'm coming! :)

@_date: 2015-02-13 12:30:32
if your dad has a smartphone, then say "ok dad, let me show you over lunch and i'll buy, is that ok?" he'll say yes of course. while at lunch, say "can i install the wallet on your phone real quick? this is the easiest way to show you how bitcoin works." if he's a cool dad he'll say ok. do it. send him some bitcoin (enough for lunch of course). show him how to buy you lunch. 
 
this assumes of course that you have a cool dad with a smartphone and the cafe accepts bitcoin.
 
but, think of how many people would start using bitcoin if you showed them how easy it was to use? just treat someone to lunch every week or so and have those friends do the same thing with their friends and so on... 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:16:24
Thank god for github (and hopefully a gitchain equiv soon). I want to keep every facet of the ePlug and its BOS as decentralized as possible. This will NEVER be run by some corporation or other central authority. Open Source is everything.

The Factom Linux Whitepaper is a work in progress, we've been working on it constantly and adding more to it via suggestions from this subreddit as well. Consensus is what will allow mods to the BOS. So, injecting a virus or malware will have to be approved by the Factom security model. For really detailed info on how Factom works, check out their Whitepaper too.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:24:12
aaah dang, you mean I'll never see you again in the decentralized world? well, enjoy the tyranny then wherever you are. nice ad for bing by the way ;) yikes. find love. here's a hug for ya at least peace.

Storj plays a MAJOR part of this. Check out the ePlug Whitepaper for info on that part of the project:  
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:11:24
The ePlug website will be a totally separate website. My personal website is about me and the projects that I work on. 
 
I know, it's so fun to say the word scam when you can't hold the product in your hands yet. 
 
The ePlug Whitepaper explains the technical specs: 
 
 
The crowdfunding on Lighthouse is broken up so that the pledgers can be involved in every step of the production.
 
You assume that I am some rich guy in a suit or something. I'm a coder turned maker who very rarely wears a suit. Look at my g+ page, you'll see what I mean. 
 
Just hang in there, you'll see where every bitcoin is going once the page is uploaded next week. 
 
The reason for this reddit post was to really let the folks know who were waiting for the kickstarter know what happened. that WAS the plan, then I discovered DEcentralized crowdfunding with Lighthouse, much more in tune to what I want to accomplish in the space. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:52:19
I hope there's a decentralized mycelium (.bit?) website goin up soon so we can still dload and grab updates.................. Google IS the nsa, lest we forget. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:23:37
The operating system is distributed, every shard of every file. That's where Factom comes in, they are the data-layer to the bitcoin blockchain. To exploit a BOS you'll have to crack the bitcoin blockchain first. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:13:36
As soon as we have an alpha, I'll get it up on my github page, sooner than later I hope but I think we have a bunch of people now who can really help us out with this part of the project. Thanx! :)

If you have any concerns about where the money will go from the crowdfunding (it won't be 140k all at once fyi, that's impossible) you can monitor every transaction on the blockchain and speak with the people the money goes to. Lmk on the skype thing, thanx mrchaddavis :) 
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:59:44
I'll take that one... 
 
A meshnet allows us to connect directly through each other, either by mobile devices, ePlugs and other types of connected nodes. 
 
The ePlug will allow you to bridge to your ISP if you like, but after some time, the ISP will no longer be needed since your connection speed and reliability will far surpass that of which your ISP will provide you with. Let alone all the censorship-free access that we'll finally be able to achieve with the meshnet. 
 
Check out for more info on meshnet tech. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions about the ePlug project, thanx :)

There's seriously no lawyers out there with enough brass balls to answer the two simple questions above? Ok, forget "legal advice" how about your persoanl opinions or direction at least? PERKINS COIE? anyone? anyone? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:49:49
Well, "qualified" people, that is hard to quantify as I feel like a blockchain reputation system will have to be present as well. Consensus on update push, kernel mods, all of it will be decentralized and distributed as much as the current technology will allow. I can't do it alone though, so your points and input are extremely valuable. Catching a heartbleed (et al) must come thru a system that constantly does its own penetration testing and self-healing (to be defined further in the whitepaper). The code is only as smart as the community that is contributing to it and is approved by the community, consensus thru reputation, validated by the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:04:03
Thanx, I couldn't agree more.  DE-centralize it all. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:13:17


I love it when someone says that. It's been a driving force my entire life. ( 


 
This has been one of my major points as well. How does a buyer trust that his/her goods will be shipped? Consensus Reputation. I think this will be one of the most challenging parts of the project. A pool of trusted Admins can push updates. The word "trusted" will have to be like a karma score on a blockchain. These people CANNOT be elected by people, they just get their score via consensus over time, upvoted commits, etc. The BOS should be programmed in a way where x number of people will be used for the updates. Anybody want to help out with the BOS Consensus Reputation api?
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:26:20
hehe ;) i've never had one single problem with it- i even did my first in-person trade using Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:49:37
These days I do a lot more business building and outsourced coding than anything. I still love to code but if you leave coding for even one year it takes a while to get caught back up again. It's actually just a lot easier to outsource it these days to people who are much better at it, using the latest libs, etc. I want to build a business around this idea so that we all benefit from it. It's open source, we're not gonna get rich. Even if it costed like $10K, all we have to do is just break that amount up into say, 10 separate phases, crowdfund each of them separately, so as an example: crowdfund 1k, the work gets done, is paid and verifiable by the blockchain, then crowdfund phase 2, the work gets done and paid and verified and so on.. This way, everybody can monitor and participate in the crowdfund, not just throw money at somebody they don't even know (me). I don't get squat, I'm just the guy with the ideas that gets the money to the coders that can actually develop such a thing and if it's impossible then I won't even attempt that project. Just today I was thinking how cool it would be if we didn't even have to download an app like Aether to use, it. Decentralized apps are the future, I am convinced of that but I do not think that the future is going to require to code our apps for every platform out there anymore. Web based decentralized apps, NOT downloadable decentralized apps. I mean Lighthouse is awesome, not sure if you've tried it yet, but please do. Now, imagine that app as a single page web app with nothing to download ahead of time. I've never claimed to be a coder who could do all this myself, hence the reason why I'm in here asking for your ideas on the project, is it even possible to do something like that yet? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:01:46
Nope, we decided to avoid Startjoin, and will be going totally DE-centralized instead, using Lighthouse.

Sort of: I have another post on the legalities of offering shares worldwide, but no lawyers have been brave enough to reply to that post yet. I was thinking bithalo, ripple codius or something like that could work alongside of the Lighthouse app. If you know any law firms in the crypto space, please show them these posts: 
 
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:37:14
I will indeed. Every funded phase of the project will be listed in my twitter stream, which is also embedded on my website and somewhere here on Reddit. Probably here on the sr. This way people can monitor each phase of the project as each gets funded and be more involved with it than your typical crowdfunding endeavour. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:51:06
Yeah, bitshares tv had a vid about that, can't recall the episode number tho. I think if they call them tokens tho, the sec will still find a way to clamp down on share disbursements or change the law to whatever they want it to be, or just use some "grey area" game with the law. If I could issue shares to someone in Uganda, would they be forced to pay taxes on it too, does it might what country the shares came from? This is all very confusing right now, hence my posts on that, trying to get some insight from law firms in the bitcoin space. If the government can take advantage of you, they will. Im gonna hold off on issuing tokens too until I see the laws myself that will regulate global shares disbursements. IP is one thing, but how can any DAO or DAC ever issue equity from a "company" that doesn't really even physically exist, ya know?

Distributed, open source operating systems are the future, I am convinced of that and the auditable nature of a blockchain serves as a perfect tool for an operating system's file shards. My primary task is to find the right people who want to assist with the project. If you are an OS expert I would love to hear how you would design an unhackable distributed os. Yeah, I know, it's "not possible" to have an "unhackable" os, but just enlighten us please, on how you would do it. Before you give up and start slinging mud at people from behind a keyboard, let's try to keep this constructive, ok? How would you do it?
