i use just the website while on computer and phone because to my knowledge there is not an app yet. never buy or sell on the coinbase app, the fees are much much less on coinbase pro

bitcoins recovery lol it's up 100% from this day last year but please present me a logical argument explaining why bitcoin will die

No hostility - I'm just waiting for you to present me with genuine reasons why Bitcoin is a "fad investment" beyond the fact that people who got in during the spike are temporarily in the red. On the other hand, in defense of Bitcoin growth we have Bakkt, increased institutional interest, better custody services, Square patent to allow merchant to accept Bitcoin, LN.

any sort of short term analysis of bitcoin is laughable. the price is clearly controlled by major players buying and selling. unless you have a direct line of communication with these people, your price projection means dick
