I think owes you an apology for grossly misrepresenting your talk in this headline.

The "only invest what you can afford to lose" people don't understand your mindset. You see Bitcoin's rise as "inevitable" and are making totally rational investment based on that viewpoint.
Rather than try and talk yourself out of doing something that seems rational, perhaps you should just adjust the strategy to better meet your goals. You're not going to be able to hold the coins long enough to realize those gains if you're forced to sell them (at a loss) to meet your fiat obligations.
There's no reason to talk you out of your "risky" buying, or to convince you that you might be wrong. I happen to think that you're right. But being truly bullish on bitcoin means having a long time preference. By overbuying for your budget you shorten your time preference and sabotage your own goals.
The correct advice for someone with your view of Bitcoin is to "only save what you can afford to save." You have dollar obligations over the short term. Lock in a buying strategy that compliments your long time preference, which might mean that you miss out on buying some sub $400 coins, but ultimately that you can actually realize their value after they appreciate another few orders of magnitude.

And perhaps not link to a nearly three year old Twitter account with 526 tweets and 16 followers.
I don't quite get you . I have you tagged as a Buttcoin mod/troll, yet I end up liking a lot of your stuff.  You only have a -8 rating from me, which is higher than most people on this embarrassing website.

There's a bubble in bitcoin stock photos used on the news.

Pretty sure what Mike did to Newsweek would have been illegal in many US states before [Lawernce v Texas]( was decided in 2003.

Question for Adam: What would be some examples of features which would render a sidechain incompatible?
For example, could a sidechain exist whose "feature" was simply a 100:1 peg with bitcoin. This wouldn't involve a reduction of scarcity because the peg would be enforced both ways.
