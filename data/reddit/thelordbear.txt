I've been fooling around with bitcoin a fair bit the last few months.  I've become convinced it will be a good investment, and I'd like to buy a fairly large amount of BTC as a long term investment.  So I have a few questions around that.
1) What is a good way to buy several thousand dollars of BTC?
2) What is the best way to secure and backup a wallet or wallets?  I would prefer my own wallet with some local and offsite backups.  How long should my password be?  Should I use multiple wallets?

I was super bullish, at $1710.  I was very wrong in the best possible way.

I've used Quadriga and Shakepay.  Quadriga was easier to fund a few years ago.  Shakepay has been pretty great so far, but I haven't bought or sold large amounts through them yet.

It depends on what you are doing.  I can mine when playing pixel art games or watching netflix with not much impact on temperature, game/video performance or mining hashes.  Playing any sort of 3d game there will be a pretty big hit on both mining and game performance.

...and bitcoin falls through the floor.
Way to jinx it.

Pretty solid bounce back so far.  I was expecting it to crash down to $900 and stay there.

I've been using QuadrigaCX.  Works well with no problems.  It does take some time to fund an account.

I'm making my own bitcoin!  With hookers!  And Blackjack!

Are paper wallets still decently secure?   I have a few btc in a fireproof safe.

$1710.  Slow steady rise this year.

Late to the party myself, bought most of mine at 800 Cad, but its still a nice profit after just a few months.

China doesn't want the US economy ruined, since the US is their  customer.  A slap to an unfriendly administration is what they are after.   
Bitcoin is a hedge against things going wrong.

Wow, I paid around $1 for my first 2, and around 10 for a couple more as well as bunch of other Zimbabwe bills.  I had no idea they are worth $50 now.  I should have bought them instead of bitcoin!  :P

I like this one.  Technical without being overwhelming:

Does the pot on the right side let you adjust the price?

A correction wouldn't surprise me one bit.  We had a 20% correction a few weeks ago.  It recovered quickly, but a bigger one is probably due after a year of unfettered growth.
Or it could go to 30k tomorrow, what do I know...
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:13:43
It really depends on where you live.  $300k would barely get you a 1 bedroom apartment where I live.  But 50 miles west it would get you a decent house and a few acres of land.

I use this site fairly often.  Their exchange rate isn't terribly great, but it is convenient.   I think you can get $15 USD/day with paypal without much verification.
@_date: 2016-09-12 03:19:40
I'm thinking about throwing about 20k in myself.  How are you holding your coins?  I was thinking about using a paper wallet in a fireproof safe, but I'd love to hear what you are doing.

Risky assets usually fall faster than less risky ones.  So they would probably crash.
If cryptos are riding a positive news wave / price uptick similar to last fall when the stock market hypothetically crashes, money from stock market could flow into crypto as a hedge.  My crystal ball is in the shop, so its hard to see for sure.

Was looking to do the same, can someone suggest a good way to get rid of it for a Canadian?
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:16:06
It really depends on the extent of the socialism. 
Socialist societies do not necessarily determine the production or prices of goods, allowing a free market to reign.  They only determine the extent and usage of taxes, and in some cases regulate monopolies.  
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:16:39
You seem to think the two are mutually exclusive.  All the happiest countries in the world (Norway, Sweeden, Canada etc.) are both Capitalist and Socialist.  One is an economic model, the other is a sociopolitical one.

Google has really cracked down lately, I used to hit up a few for fun, but now I'm down two two that give around 300 an hour.  Not really that useful, but when you're behind a computer all day at work, it does pay for a few transaction fees a week.

I keep 2 versions of a paper wallet, one in a safe in at my parent's place, the other in a fireproof lockbox, buried in a bunch of junk in my storage room.
To keep it extra safe, I changed the seed a bit, i.e incrementing the last letter/number by 1 or whatever (I'm not telling you, you dirty internet theives!).  
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:25:44
I'll go with: 2613.
My reasoning is that we'll get a bump from segwit to 3k or so, and then it will come back down.

Well, the point is that a thief wouldn't know which word is wrong, or how many.  It would still be possible to brute force, but would still take awhile.  
You could also send a small amount of crypto to the 'wrong' address as a decoy.
Obfuscation is obviously no substitute for physical security.  But some people don't have complete control or faith in their physical measures.  It's meant to buy time in case of a physical breach.  It can also save you in case of a 'wrench' scenario, unless the attacker verifies the address on site.
For a really large amount of crypto, I would also recommend not having all your eggs in one basket and splitting the amount into multiple keys.  This would also take multiple physical security measures in different locations, so it may not be feasible for some.

I'm thinking of putting a few hundred bucks into BTC as a long term investment (several years).  
What is the best way to hold this?  A cloud based wallet, or have my own wallet with an encrypted backup offsite somewhere?  Or split it up between wallets?
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:01:12
On top of all this, you can obfuscate your seed by changing one of the key words (or seed letters),  and then putting that word elsewhere (email, a different safe etc).  So the last word in your key isn't actually 'Duck' as stamped onto your metal fireproof ingot, encased in cement and in a saftey deposit box.  It's actually 'Goose' as you carved into the tree in your yard.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:02:05
I'd also recommend starting with, and getting comfortable with, transferring small amounts before you move onto big ones.  It can be nerve wracking waiting for a large amount of bitcoin to confirm a transfer.  I  also move large amounts in smaller batches.
Make sure you have a backup of your private key.  I keep a copy in my own safe, but also in a safe in my parents house.  Fireproofing is important, and the ability to access your wallet quickly in the event of theft could be key too.
You can also make your key nearly 100% unhackable by changing one or two letters or words in your key phrase.  You just need to remember what has changed.  i.e change the first/last/8th word of the keyphrase, and then email yourself the word, just in case.
