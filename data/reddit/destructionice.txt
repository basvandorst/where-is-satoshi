I love my adblocker.

Many ways.  Root your phone. Install AdAway, or otherwise modify your hosts file.  On apple, IDK.
I guess with apple you can get a firewall device, install pfsense and add pfblockerng to block all ads everywhere on all your Wi-Fi connected devices.
I dunno might be a hassle to some but well worth it
Edit:  there are some "proxy blockers" that may work for apple, but I've never used that type of blocker.  Point being, in a "free" world, nobody should HAVE to be subjected to ads.  There are lots of ways to block them.

I dunno.  I heard terrorists drink dihydrogen monoxide.

I'm getting flashbacks from DARE, MADD, and all other sensationalized advocacy groups.  I expect we'll start hearing things like this next...
All it takes is one satoshi to ruin your loved ones lives.
Friends don't let friends "bitcoin".
If you "bitcoin", you fund terrorists.
This is your brain... This is your brain on bitcoin. Any questions?

Well maybe.  I think they're "stabilizing" the 7nm now for mass production.  It's a long journey to qualify a process.  Not only do the fabs have to be able to make it, but EDA tool vendors have to make tools that work with the physics of the node.  Be it mask patterning, signal integrity engine tweaks, synthesis tweaks, etc.  3.5nm is two nodes away though.  Maybe we should ask, when will 5nm be ready, first.
