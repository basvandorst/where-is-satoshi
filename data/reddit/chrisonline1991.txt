I bought my [Audio-Technica]( Mic for 20% off.
Purse.io is awesome, i have a lot of stuff i don't NEED.  I just through it on a amazon wishlist and ask the highest % off and keep it there for months(or until i decide i do NEED it)

Can you send me some info on that?  I didn't find "executor" in the E.O. and Googling for "primary executor executive order" doesn't seem to return relevant info.
I read through your recent posts and you say a lot about the relevant E.O. and a lot of people are skeptical of what you have to say.  A few things that come to mind:
* The E.O. seems more like a "law" than the FAQ on the treasury website.  Therefore the FAQ doesn't hold much weight for me. I imagine if i was in a court room because i "violated" the E.O. bringing up the FAQ from the treasury website would only give the Judge a chuckle, nothing more. I imagine the judge would just say that the Secretary of Treasury said (doesn't matter how they said it, since it doesn't specify in the EO) that the person i donated too was in violation of EO 13694, section 1(a). If i brought up what you seem to be saying about how sanctions worked in the past, mention the OFAC, etc. the judge could simply point out the EO 13694 and how it doesn't mention the OFAC, or the SDN list.
* It seems to me like because you are talking about things outside of the EO 13694, and how sanctions work in general people are more skeptical.  If I've never heard of the primary executor, OFAC, SDN list, etc and they aren't listed in the EO then i just have to take your word for it.  Unless it's common knowledge once you understand how sanctions work; I assume most people don't understand how sanctions work.
* if my last point is valid then i think your best bet is to educate people on how sanctions work. Telling them over and over that Snowden isn't included in the SDN list will do nothing. Also telling them yourself how sanctions work means nothing, because i have no idea who you are, and therefore have no way to tell if you are credible.

Can you tell me in what section it talks about the SDN list or the OFAC?

In case anyone else is wondering it does mention here:  info about the CDN list. According to those FAQs is correct.
However, my understanding is that the CDN list and QFAC aren't mentioned in the E.O. paleh0rse, can you clarify?
