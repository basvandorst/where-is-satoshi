For one thing, the average US household income is WAAAAAY higher than the average world household income, but these kind of "if Bitcoin were evenly distributed" models are definitely thought-provoking. Owning one ten-millionth of any entire economy is nothing to shake a stick at.

Pretty wild to think that in 10 years, a typical hard drive might be able to contain a ledger of every financial transaction in the world. Craziness.

Woohoo! Thanks for the internets!

I see what you did there.

See how they wrote "Bit" instead of "But"? Clever, huh?

I wouldn't mind a wonderful experience with Coinbase right now.  I sold 1BTC on there 12 days ago, and it still hasn't hit my bank account. Of course, if they FORGOT to transfer it, I wouldn't mind at all if they just kept the BTC in my account instead...

That mortgage/rent concept is genius. I've been wondering how very large purchases would work in a world of deflationary currency (where loans are no longer profitable). That pretty much solves it.

1. Here's a fun idea. Order an iPad from Apple with your public and private keys engraved on it. Now Apple is transmitting money!
2. Would the government go after him if he was engraving your keys on wooden blocks instead of shiny, round pieces of metal? Money is silly...

I thought it meant "Wise Origin", which is  pretty self-explanatory, no?

If, every time he collected his fee, a coin magically appeared out of thin air...

I think the joke here is that the letter is crap and he intends to flush it down the toilet. Sheesh, is it really that hard to figure out?

Great, this is only going to support the theory that Bitcoin is just for stoners :)
(And that was TOTALLY an automated, meaningless response).
