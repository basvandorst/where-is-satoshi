There's no reason they can't co-exist.
The people who think that bitcoin is some kind of poison ivy to banks usually don't know the first thing about them.

Many of the exchanges out there are already fractional reserve.
They might not wear a suit and swan about Central London but they're still very much there, and even less regulated in the crypto world.

Haha, man I'm a programmer. Will still be programming in 10.
What do you want me to do. Shake myself to death in fear?

I don't see why bitcoin kills that.

Thread was about coin being orthogonal to banking. It'll be there bro

I absolutely question it. But most of the discussion here seems to be driven by religious vitriol rather than pragmatic thought about how a new system might work.
Crypto is far far from being a complete solution, and even in a world where bitcoin is pervasive, your banks are not going away.

I watched the entire first series of game of thrones. And drank enough that the air staff had to inform me of their 'duty of care'.

I'm asking....

It's also doesn't look like it will happen. Right now all indication is that rates will go up.

Which parts of their business does bitcoin threaten?
@_date: 2016-07-19 04:08:16
I think it's more that bitcoin is sort of orthogonal to what an investment bank actually does.
I work tech at a bank, and divisions are scrambling to make sure they don't miss the ball on this one. But actually working out how the technology fits beyond being a tradable asset, is actually a little more difficult than you'd think.
Also, think bout this. Without fractional reserve and inflation, hoarding cash becomes too lucrative to inexpensivly loan it to someone who can make better use of it.

Anyway I'm flying back to London from Tokyo now, gonna be offline for 12 hours. Will be sure to check in when I get back.
Any nice plans for the day?

I see 'gold standard'---like as a problem. Currency (I think) works as a constantly moving token. Not a unit of absolute value.

See great depression.
OK no negative interest rates. But while they are a subject of some apprehension, they are by no means spelling 'doom' within the bank.
In fact, post 2008 capital and liquidity regulations have already caused banks to start paying each other to take their cash in a lot of cases. It'll probably just result in a well needed adjustment.
Valuing the trillion dollar derivative market - think about this. That car insurance policy you have for £800 a year that could payout £10,000,000 in the case of a major accident, is that instrument worth £800 or £10Million? Those valuations are meaningless, and usually gross.

I'm a technologist and pretty safe in any shift in monetary structure. I support bitcoin, I know it on a deep technical level.
I'm just curious how you picture an economy with no cheap borrowing?
Or do you just think I'm in the illuminati?

It's weathered much worse historically.
