I thought the point of Bitcoin was the unaccountably.
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:40:36
Yes, most feature homeopathy-like medical claims.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:26:31
Once again, Bitcoin being linked to nefarious actions. Not a good look!
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:06:43
Technically he lost the moment he put all his money into a speculation.
If you don't have cash, you don't have cash.
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:08:49
I trust him. It was Ross Ulbricht who hacked MtGox and stole everything.
@_date: 2015-06-19 06:21:45
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Their debt crisis would not have been prevented if they used Bitcoin as their currency nor can it be fixed if they switch to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:03:53
But why not cut out the middle man and just direct deposit?
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:54:36
I'm glad other people make fake accounts so that I don't have to do anything. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:19:46
The public doesn't have a say in the sentencing. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:08:49
I trust him. It was Ross Ulbricht who hacked MtGox and stole everything.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:52:32
Yep that was not this case though. Ross should have plead guilty, he must have known all the evidence against him. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:15:00
It's a pump and dump and you want a quick exit back to real money.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:23:32
It can be both of those things....
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:12:46
Not really, you still have to go through the hassle of finding a reputable fiat exchange that will put the money in your bank account. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:33:00
Pretty much every post is "you should have bought Bitcoin!!"
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:52:32
Yep that was not this case though. Ross should have plead guilty, he must have known all the evidence against him.

It was one magazine. Not "the media".

The giddiness of at the pain and suffering of Greece is really disgusting.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:44:30
This what penny stock salesmen say.

Maybe you're just drawn to those things.

He did exactly what the free market allowed him to do. There were no regulations, protections, or guarantees.

Bitcoin: the currency of the New World Order.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:01:37
But you're not sending money; you're sending a digital representation of the value at the time of transmission. 
It's still a pyramid scheme benefitting the early buyers.
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:07:04
So I guess you can give away your increasingly valuable currency to them? Huh?
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:36:52
They didn't say, meaning it could be something as trivial as the design elements.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:27:59
Inexpensive to who? The ones with enough idle time to research Bitcoin and learn how to properly use it? 
Have you ever lived in poverty?
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:00:27
I signed up but never put money into the service, my name and email are on there.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:19:14
Then what's the point of taking bitcoin instead of Visa?
@_date: 2014-05-09 06:02:12
Can you even define "money in politics"?
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:46:51
Doesn't that mean you're just losing more and more real money?
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:32:58
I don't understand, so the price was pegged to USD and not bitcoin? What's the point of using bitcoin over a credit card or cash?
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:13:34
I thought the point of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized. Why try to centralize it in the worst way (banks)?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:07:25
Why should they get "extra privacy protection"?
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:27:20
Yep those are the only two things you see here in America. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:06:04
Question: why are the prices in stores that accept bitcoin pegged to USD and not BTC?
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:25:25
Also the merciless way that personal lives are examined. Most people have made mistakes in their past and would not like to relive and have to explain away those things.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:01:21
Bitcoin affected, dollar unaffected.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:56:29
Which major business is not converting the bitcoins immediately to USD after the transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:59:52
Why are you living in fear?
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:58:37
It's the accent. In an American accent it's doggy.
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:55:22
Newsflash! When you spend bitcoins, it lowers the price!
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:15:56
Why can't this bug be fixed?

I hate when people remake that game and can't get the physics right.
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:00:01
Why does this matter at all? Bitcoin can't be declared illegal, you can always pay cash. There's literally nothing they can do to stop the protocol.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:25:37
"The potential is that one day I can send you Bitcoins, you receive them in your wallet, go to the grocery store, and spend them at the checkout. "
Assuming the price doesn't fluctuate. Or are we in the fantasy realm where USD doesn't exist anymore and BTC is the one-world currency?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:06:29
Newsweek has no control over that.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:05:30
Why? They already take credit cards.
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:03:58
Whatever happened to decentralization?
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:41:29
It's pronounced doggycoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:08:36
This is getting hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:11:09
Yes, exactly. Some people are comfortable with that and don't want to change to this new fangled cyber money.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:53:07
Why not just answer the question?
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:08:46
People absolutely LOVE unstable currencies.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:15:51
Really? It will give you USD for bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:39:12
It's all collapsing.
@_date: 2014-09-21 00:13:35
Nobody is spending. They're just holding, waiting for more buyers.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:15:17

My grandparents don't.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:02:57
I'm skeptical.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:26:48
Bitcoin is a transfer service, not a currency.
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:58:08
Why do Bitcoin fanatics continually want to revert back to centralization? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:03:20
If you spend bitcoins, the price of them will drop. This is because 99% of businesses instantly convert them to real currency upon receipt.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:53:18
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:10:07
You have to look at the inverse as well:
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:28:03
Which wasn't illegal.
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:33:46
No context? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:36:42
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:48:27
Notice that he could not bring himself to say the word "bitcoin". He almost did it one time and then stopped and corrected himself with "digital currencies".

@_date: 2014-09-06 02:55:42
Trying to back out of your statement when proven wrong huh?
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:50:01
But your question was more outrage than inquisitive. How dare they lower the value of your money.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:39:58
You could do that with money though...
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:41:57
4 people huh. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:27:47
People without computers need to use money too.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:09:31
It looks like businesses are using it more as a transaction system than a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:47:55
Notice that Blockchain didn't quote the actual reason for rejection from the App Store.
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:58:14
Do they take Euros too? Same thing really.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:57:57
Yeah, don't mention how if you lose your password then you've lost all your money. People would get afraid if you told them that.
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:49:56
Then why is the price still in the 200s?
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:47:33
I've got a car that's going down in value, might want to get it now before the next price spike on it.

Even if 90% of those distortions were true, I'd still want her as president over Trump, who, in his infinite wisdom, said today:
“I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on.”
Please point me to a single thoughtful, profound statement that Trump has ever made in his entire life that consists of more than "______ is very bigly [good|bad]."

Their twitter account has made some wild leaps of logic based on vague language in some unverified emails. I wouldn't give them too much credit.

@_date: 2015-07-16 15:16:26
Why do Bitcoin users want to emulate fiat institutions? Why not keep everything decentralized?
@_date: 2015-08-05 01:58:05
Yet another Bitcoin thing that was scamming people. Weird how that keeps happening.
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:15:32
So if a bitcoin exchange builds up a great reputation then shuts down suddenly and steals all the bitcoins, that's ok?
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:01:30
But if every product you can buy with Bitcoin is still pegged to fiat prices, then what's the point of converting to a highly fluctuating currency?
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:39:20
Sounds like something that regulations would fix.
@_date: 2016-02-10 07:46:38

Why does a commodity have a “community”? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:44:27
So it dispenses USD from your wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:06:48
It’s just a naming scheme.
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:39:37
Thanks for admitting that Bitcoin will not replace USD within 10 years.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:54:21
So how is he going to cash it out for real money?
@_date: 2015-04-05 04:35:48
So you broke the law? 
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:56:44
How do you use bitcoins without electricity? Have they solved that flaw yet?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:16:50
Those are transaction vehicles for currency, not currency itself.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:29:26

That's called the "sunk cost" fallacy. 
Honestly, cutting and running is your best bet.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:45:33
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:43:10
Yeah I'd be worried. There aren't enough miners to keep the transactions confirmed. It's going to get slower and slower, eventually become useless, and the price will plummet.
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:29:19
Why do you need fiat venture capital bucks for a bitcoin startup? Just mine your way to profitability.
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:39:38
Why does Bitcoin need approval from anyone or anything to operate? 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:15:44
Another centralized Bitcoin tragedy. When will Bitcoin users stop falling for this trap?
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:54:40
This is just the free market at work. If there wasn't a demand to give away your CPU cycles, uTorrent wouldn't have included it.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:50:19
And yet the first thing everyone does with Bitcoin is start centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:19:51
It's really funny how you think the NSA doesn't have IP + Bitcoin address logs. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:21:55

@_date: 2017-05-12 23:30:50

So just go to centralized services where you could get robbed? Haven't we heard this story over and over?
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:36:11
Then why do Bitcoin users continually go to centralized services to use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:20:26
I'm surprised it didn't take 10 minutes. The evidence was overwhelming and they even caught him in the act.

95% of all trials are settled in plea deals. The other 5% go to trial on the defense's plea of innocence. There is ALWAYS a plea deal presented to the defense.

@_date: 2013-03-23 01:08:56
Or Beanie Babies.

Currency of the future!
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:56:49
It's fun to learn about bubbles!
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:15:14
Why is the price in USD and not bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:21:34
When the price starts falling, what price below 65 will you try to sell at?
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:18:53
BTC's worth is measured by what people will pay for them.
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:23:36
Today is not 4 months ago.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:35:09
But Bitcoin will never go down in value.
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:10:47
Never mind the overwhelming evidence on Ross's laptop.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:51:29
Probably should have declared it.
@_date: 2013-05-11 02:32:27
Couldn't you have done that with USD?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:29:08
It was a bubble in the early 80s, it's a bubble now.
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:05:21
A bubble is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:42:54
Shouldn't have voted for a nanny state.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:57:03
It's like paying for things with Tesla stock.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:00:58
What's the point of a currency if you can't spend it?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:16:27
Aww, can't take a joke?
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:55:55
First Wikispeed, next GM!!!! Bitcoin is unstoppable!!!
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:06:33
Ironic that he was mining bitcoins to buy weed with.
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:28:50
You're right, don't sell. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:55:27
Please see the post about the poor guy who almost lost his entire bitcoin fortune because of a hard disk failure.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:24:29
Great currency you got there.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:46:04
Then work to change the law.

Currency of the future!
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:45:14
How do you design the market value into something? Think about that for a second.
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:09:34
This is why people think bitcoin is a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:01:30
But your rent will fluctuate from month to month in BTC because they're pegging it to USD. Just cut out the middle man and pay in USD.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:00:29
I'm sure they peg the monthly rates to USD. So what's the point?
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:31:24
It's not a currency until the prices are pegged to BTC instead of USD.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:47:25
Buy high, sell low!
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:45:34
You realize that everyone who came before you paid taxes to create the civilization that you currently enjoy. 
Now tell me again why you feel like its not fair for yourself to pay taxes.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:08:05
If the ordinary people in the media don't get it, why would bitcoin ever reach a large audience?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:46:09
Your currency has nothing backing it. What did you expect?
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:25:18
You're assuming that a bitcoin payer would always pay on time and have the funds.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:27:17
It's the survivalist mentality that I'm calling crazy. People were making the same predictions about post-2000 America and none of it came true. Meanwhile, they were tucked away in some remote forest with their guns and canned foods, wasting their time.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:45:13
You would be insane to put your money into anything that has reached it's peak.
It's buy low, sell high; not the other way around.
@_date: 2013-07-06 11:46:04
Its price is market based.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:50:08
I'm glad to see that normal currencies are not threatened by the intellect of bitcoin users.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:57:11
It'll go up forever! Just like tulips!
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:22:18
Easily? Explain that.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:40:59
Past results are not an indication of future performance.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:07:02
But all the prices in those stores are pegged to dollar equivalents.
Bitcoin does not have it's own economy!
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:49:01
Deflationary spiral.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:17:13
Classic bubble indicator: luddites jump on board.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:30:00
Not a currency, it's a speculative vehicle.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:48:43
But only if there's a market that's willing to spend $136,000 on another currency.
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:22:34
I like how they’re asking for damages in $US instead of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:05:31
You could say that about literally any investment back to infinity. "I could have bought AAPL at $10/share", "I could have sold MSFT yesterday when it was up .5%, now it's down .7%." 
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:05:54
What price below 65 will you try to sell at?
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:59:03
Is that what the pets.com investors told each other after the bubble burst?
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:47:44
That gear shifter leather covering is hideous.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:46:44
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the only options for buying bitcoins banks or in-person cash?
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:12:43
Kinda makes you doubt any credibility the OP had.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:25:36
Dat ratio
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:45:06
That's a good question to ask before you invest.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:30:03
How a cash transaction works:
1. I hand you the amount you request in payment for goods/services.
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:41:22
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:58:40
Notice that he has real currency, not fake internet currency.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:27:08
I can't wait to join this pool. Screw bitcoin. You holders better exit now!
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:19:28
I've been saying it's a bubble for weeks.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:46:59
And this is why people think Bitcoin is nuts.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:44:15
Basically the drug trade on Silk Road.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:24:15
I think you missed my point. You'd still be paying in USD, just with a conversion to another currency first.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:35:56
Wow, you would use symbol of the neo-con-drug-hypocrite-in-chief?
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:53:19
Huh? You realize there are 100s of individuals with enough cash ON THEIR OWN to buy all bitcoins in existence.
Bitcoin is smaller than Beanie Babies were at their peak. Or tulips...
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:31:02
$300,000 (notice no bitcoin price) for a no-name supercar?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:34
Classic bubble speculation happening.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:45:07
They would be affected positively if anything.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:49:27
Don't buy until the price stays within a 1% for 3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:15:44
Will the prices be pegged to USD and fluctuate in BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:45:52
Why is it that BTC true-believers are always trying to sugar-coat the way things are presented?
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:42:23
Deflationary spiral.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:49:59
Here comes inflation!
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:49:15
Why would you sell low?
@_date: 2013-10-15 16:02:47
As low as 5.5%"
Why would anyone buy from a company that charges 5.5% and doesn't know that the plural of 'fee' isn't 'fees'?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:33:50
Why is there not a fixed bitcoin price? Doesn't that mean you're just buying it in USD?
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:38:56
Most of the people on Reddit (the Spartans: HOLD people) are basically playing it like a slot machine.
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:26:38
Past performance is not an indicator of future performance.

Mt. Gox says hi.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:49:46
I predict you'll be complaining about how dumb the portrayal was if they ever do the episode.
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:40:24
It would take the entire episode to explain what it is, how to purchase it, and how to cash it out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:15:36
Classic pump &amp; dump scam.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:23:32
Not really what I meant, but good point.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:39:01
I assume you don't use any USD at this point since you're a true believer. How do you pay bills?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:21:04
It's like people paying in stock of Tesla.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:41:48
Confirmation bias.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:53:49
So you want to take advantage of the benefits that everyone that has come before you have paid for with their taxes?
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:46:33
Quite a bit more, percentage-wise.
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:43:33
If goats could grow wings, I wouldn't have so little legroom right now on this plane.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:24:07
Heineken sells directly to customers?
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:43:41
Tell him to make sure it gets converted to USD as soon as possible to mitigate the rapid fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:09:23
USD and Yen unaffected also.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:57:30
Will the price in BTC be fixed or will it always be fluctuating?
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:11:03
Can't wait to buy a cheap Lexus!
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:18:06
But the chart says up!! Up!!
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:51:58
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:48:50
This sounds like trolling for sympathy. And look! He posted his address so generous people can throw money at him because they feel bad!
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:53:24
Just saw this on LocalBitcoins.com:

90.72 USD/BTC 
I am a local College Student with an enthusiasm for Cryptocurrencies. I will meet you in a public, private**, or secure location and will transfer the funds to a specified address or create you a wallet for FREE. Discreteness is key (No ID, No Verification, ID Anonymity Protection)

Good way to get robbed.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:48:05
Why is the price not in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:57:34
When the top is reached and the buyers are exhausted, the speculators (of which are most people who own BTC) will head for the exits and try to cash out, making the value plummet.
It's the same story as with every other speculative bubble in the history of mankind.
But I get it, people become blind with greed, they'll soon deny the reality in front of them, and then finally be filled with regret that they didn't cash out when they had it good.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:53:37
Why would someone buy in at the top?
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:53:02
They have individual names, you know.
