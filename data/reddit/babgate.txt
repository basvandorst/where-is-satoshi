How can they discuss what doesn't happen?

Seriously, who would be so dumb as to subscribe and deliver their data to a BAB exchange? What we have is already enough, we don't need this exchange.

One can see the sort of LIARS they are by the first answer:


LMFAO WHAT??? The NAME of the sub ir BTC!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dude, just so you realize. Plenty of BCashers like myself, as you loved to call us, abandoned that shitcoin. After the hard-fork fiasco and the creation of amaury BAB token, no serious development, ABC absurd incompetence and github cloning, it is really impossible to support that.
The cherry on the top is of course r/btc and roger ver. The guy is pathetic but we sort of swallowed him so that we could see the roadmap evolving.
Just take a look at what r/btc is, it is a blatant rent-seeking cesspool, promoting a guy who's the equivalent of a lollypop seller in a kindergarten. All they really have is domain names: bitcoin.com and r/btc subreddit. Remove it and the whole castle falls apart, as ABC is a pathetic team of devs.
Enough is enough.

FWIW [this is a sample of the rbtc down-vote-bot in action]( After I posted the comment and refreshed the page, my vote count was already zero.
I'm so happy I sold my BAB in good time.

You mean like the EXACT way I did with my thread in r/btc and got *the most vile disrespectful and dishonest replies*?
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:21:25
r/btc WAS an alternative sub for discussing the blocksize. I agree with that, only because it had true community around it with this goal. Now it is not that anymore, with the demise of bitmain and the hard fork power grab it has RV left, alone, and some yuppie new-rich old bitcoiners controlling a repo. The real user-base migrated to other coins in these last months, visibly.
Furthermore, just STFU about r/bitcoin and "blocksize debate", everything you attribute to theymos you did 10 times worse: mass ban, character assassination, doxxing, bribing, pump and dump schemes, rent-seeking daily RV propaganda, even helped bitmain's IPO scams.


I never said to "take over", stop projecting the things you do yourselves. I asked in a few words "what about changing this compromised moderator team"? Of course I knew what would be the response, your lot is very predictable. You look worse and worse and these discussions help real people to stay away from you.

Ok, apologies because I'm being brigaded and thought you were one more (effective tactics it seems).


You often see the same small group of lunatics, but there was far more grassroots activity before. For instance, two examples: many different people used to tip a lot of newcomers, this basically vanished. Some of the "top connoisseurs" went silent these last months. To me both are very visible.
