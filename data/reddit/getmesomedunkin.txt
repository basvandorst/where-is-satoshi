Bitcoin needs to prove its stability before Amazon would accept it.

lol, nope.

And then you'll spin right around and make fun of people who were "too stupid" to understand bitcoin and how it was their own fault when they got scammed.

I figured that was the point of bitcoin? So people could do whatever they wanted.

I thought Bitcoin was a currency, not a commodity?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:09:01


Yes. That's why it's volatile. There's more currency speculation going on than anything else. Why else would some dude hoard 900 coins over a few years and do nothing with them? Because he's speculating that the price will go back up, just like everyone else is.

I love gawking in on bitcoin arguments.
"You're a dummy head!"
"No **YOU'RE** the dummy head!"
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:20:58
This sounds exactly what I would expect from bitcoin.

Hey, you signed off on the proofs.

Heat isn't the issue. Heat transfer is the issue. And you can set up perfectly fine heat transfer conditions in the Caribbean.

As long as your planning for it, heat really isn't much of an issue. There are some full size servers which operate at 100F and higher inlet temperatures. The real issue is maintaining consistent temperatures whether they be high or low, and providing air flow so the heat is rejected. If the fans fail, then you have a problem, but that will be a problem regardless of your location.
You can set that up easily as long as your gear can handle it.

Wait, is Bitcoin a risky bet or a currency?
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:11:22
I found the unicorn.

I'm laughing so hard seeing that people are just now figuring this out.
The only reason to spend Bitcoin was if you think the future value of it would be equal to, or less, than the current value.
But if you wanted a return on your investment... HODL BOYS, HODL! BUY MORE AND HODL!
And now, people stop buying, and no one is trading so the value tanks.
It's nice seeing people realize they're facing the grim reality of the beanie baby craze.

You must be deaf.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:21:16
Why not?
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:07:52
If you'd like it.

You put all of your money into a savings account?
