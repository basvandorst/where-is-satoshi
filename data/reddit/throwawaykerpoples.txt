I see two groups of people who mean nothing to anyone. On the one side, non-elected Canadian senators. In Canada senators are appointed for life based on how well they kiss the ass of the Prime Minister in power, it's complete pork. On the other side the bitcoin foundation of Canada. What the heck is a Bitcoin foundation of Canada? Why is it necessary? For a supposedly decentralized currency, do you really need these organizations?

Just out of curiosity, why is the prevailing belief around here that this is manipulation? I think the simplest explanation is that it's someone with a lot of coins s/he wants to sell and doesn't want to muck around putting up a little bit at a time for sale.

Well you do have the Silk Road type businesses where their wares are sold for Bitcoin and that Bitcoin is held by the enterprising young merchant. Also, you do have Overstock claiming that they hold some of the Bitcoin revenue as Bitcoin and that they offered to pay bonuses in Bitcoin. I haven't looked into whether they actually followed through with this.
But putting all of that aside, I think you can still have a value for Bitcoin without it actually becoming a unit of exchange. For example say hypothetically that Bitcoin was used extensively for remittances but wasn't used for anything else. So the only type of activity Bitcoin had was Currency A==&gt;Bitcoin==&gt;Currency B and was never held long term by anyone. It would still need to have a value in order to facilitate the volume of remittance transactions.
