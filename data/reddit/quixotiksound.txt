Someone who does some very small scale mining with his home computer here. I would say that if you're interested in doing it as a hobby project go for it, but here's a couple things to keep in mind:
1) Don't mine Bitcoin. Join a mining pool like zpool or NiceHash, use a multi-algorithm switcher, set it and forget it. Most mining pools pay out in Bitcoin, even though you're mining different currencies.
2) It is profitable, but like people are saying, given the sharp rise of Bitcoin lately, it would be far more profitable to just buy some and hodl. However, if Bitcoin were to happen to dip down again in price for about 6 - 8 months (which is actually good in the short term if you are mining) you could find yourself in a position where you've paid off all your gear and you're holding as much Bitcoin as you would have if you had just invested that money but now your rig is going to keep running and making you money. That's a big "if" though. Personally, I bought a single 1080ti to mine off of and use for gaming about 5 months ago, and in terms of financial decisions, I would have been better off spending my money buying that much Bitcoin. However, the card has almost paid itself off already and I've got a killer computer I can use when not mining. In general it makes me around $4 - $5 CAD per day before electricity costs. Electricity is less than a dollar per day.
That's all!

$3... Jesus, as someone new to Bitcoin, I can't even imagine it at that price. It's seriously impressive that you've managed to keep it all.

Seems like there's very few people from the early days who don't have some sort of a horror story about buying a coffee for 100BTC or losing a hard drive with untold riches, so it's good to hear someone did it right. But ya, if there's a right time to hop off this crazy ride that bitcoin is going on right now, it's not very clear, so I'm gonna hodl for the foreseeable future as well and hope it pays off.

If you gave me $20,000 to spend however I liked, I would put the majority of it in bitcoin, and then spend a modest amount on a mining rig. Good luck with your research. If you get stuck or have any burning questions, feel free to reach out!

Ya, I imagine there will come a time with more stability when cryptocurrencies are in more common usage. The volatility over the past few months has been insane. Hopefully it'll stabilize at some ridiculously high value where you've got more money than you can spend, so you can have the opportunity to reap the benefits of that patience.
