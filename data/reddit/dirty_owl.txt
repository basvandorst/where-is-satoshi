okay I bought some in September and some in November with the plan to hold for at least one complete year, but its January and watching the market is not helping my S.A.D. 
So I am going to stop checking prices for awhile. Could you guys start posting various rocket, moon, upwards joy memes when/if things start to pick up again?

Weren't futures supposed to make the price of btc *less* volatile? It really seems like it's been more bumpy recently than I recall seeing since this Fall when I started staring at it every ten minutes.

But what do you say that to people who are pro crypto but just don't think BTC is the one?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:08
So here's the question: couldn't they do this but the opposite direction? Bet that BTC will go up, and then buy it like crazy? 
At least, wouldn't SOME of them choose to do that to play against the short-sellers? 
I think it would require a concerted effort, all banksters on the same page, to topple BTC with short-selling on the futures market, and while I think that could happen, I wonder how it plays out when some of them don't play along. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:23:19
It's because people are taking short term positions, sometimes with leverage, and they either get wiped out, or they pull out because they (or their software) starts to see the expected reward as too low to stay in.

yes it will crash then it will continue to go back up within a couple of days. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:27:37
I think the net effect of futures trading is going to keep things "normal" - i,e, a 10-15% drop every week or so, then a continued climb. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:55:26
Like I always say. The price of Bitcoin is not changing at all. It's the value of everything else.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:37
Seems to me that any concerted effort to fuck with the BTC market with futures is just going to make the ups and downs more dramatic, and eventually they will realize there is more money to be made betting on the price going up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:38:04
I thought a futures contract was an agreement to trade the actual commodity at some point in the future for an agreed upon price?? I.e. there actually needs to be some BTC trading there at some point. Otherwise it wouldn't have any smoothing affect on markets at all?

I know a slight bit about cryptography and security, but I don't understand why wallets and wallet software generate a seed phrase for you, that you must then keep a copy of to restore the wallet.
Wouldn't it be possible to simply input a suitably long passphrase of your own? It seems like that would be more secure.

Some people decided to take profits before the other exchange started selling futures. Triggered a bunch of stop orders, then the dip got people buying in again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:47:02
I know you've only been in this for a week but take it from an oldtimer like me who has been in for a month. It seems bumpier now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:32:57
The worry is that the steep increase this past week is futures traders, who are buying up as much as they can before futures trading opens next week. Then they are all going to short BTC on the futures market, then dump their coins. This will trigger all of the nervous newbs who will dump their btc and get out. 
I think this assumes much more cooperation among bankster types than we've ever seen evidence of, and futures trading certainly doesn't work like this in normal commodities markets - usually it smooths the volatility rather than adding to it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:54
I would actually not mind if the price trend fell back down to *merely parabolic.* 
Or that it slumped a bit only increased another 1000% in 2018.

I read a couple of those technical analysis of bitcoin blogs where they say "look at this chart! As you can see from some lines I am drawing here connecting pieces of it, that the trendline is perpendicular to the failing resistance of the square root of your mom so my recommendation is to do a thing and then eat a donut"
But I actually do take some comfort in the idea that price was increasing along a certain parabola all year, and then in December it spiked "hypodermically" above that parabola, and so people have not wanted to buy as normal because they figure, well, the price is probably going to come back down. And that the drop back down to the former parabola will be painful but then after that we'll get another 10x or more increase over the course of 2018. 
But whatever! Spaghetti!

Just got around to reading [the Wired article]( from the other week. And wondering what people's thoughts are on the issue of global power use mining btc. 


So that's a lot. And one defense I have heard is that the traditional finance networks take up a lot too but that's sort of addressed:


There was some other stuff in the article that seemed fairly clued in. Not a bad read.

Go to the bank and take out the most cash that you would be willing to put into a metal bin outdoors and light on fire. Then, put that money back in your bank, and go to one of the exchanges and open an account there so you can transfer fiat currency in. Transfer your money in, and place a buy order. Then forget you ever did that for at least a year. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:40:48

It's just that when you start researching bitcoin and blockchain in general, it gets you questioning what the actual value of money is. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:33
But in the same way, isn't gold just shiny metal nothing? 
I think the computational work done to mine each block, and the way it lets you record transactions of it in a way that is public and verifiable without any trusted third party are the two parts of the value. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:37:19
Eventually BTC will stop going up and all the other currencies will start going down.

It does correct. It corrects every couple of days, and there is a big one every month or so.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:36:46

People call it a bubble because they don't understand that the blockchain is it's own value proposition, and the initial value of the token is the work put into mining it.
But honestly the freedom is a double edged sword.

When you do a leveraged trade, you need to have some funds to cover the bet. Unless this guy had a lot of fiat or something, when the price got to a certain point above 8020, the exchange closed the trade on him and he lost everything.

It does. There were actually compelling reasons for December and also some of the earlier bull runs, from exchanges making it easier to put fiat money in, to futures contracts being offered by the two commodities exchanges.

Has anybody done some analysis of the blockchain to see if the addresses that are selling since the dip began tend to the be the ones that were buying during the swell?
I'm just kind of curious if there is a way to tell if its the same money coming out that went in...i.e. if the people who bought the upswing pulled their money out, or if it was longer-term positions taking profit.
