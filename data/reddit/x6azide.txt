I cancelled the unconfirmed transaction.
Resent with a fee. Now with 20 confirmations.  Thanks!
Blockchain.info labeled it as a double spend though but seems to have gone through so... No issues

Thank you!
I tried that and now resent the same amount but with a higher fee. 
Blockchain.info is now saying the transaction is a double spend. Does that mean it won't get confirmed? Or whichever of the two transactions confirms first will be the one that goes through?

Ok so the double spend has 1 confirmation. If it gets enough confirmations will the original transaction with no fee just be ignored/cancelled?

I guess what I don't like about Armory is that if I haven't opened it in awhile it takes forever to sync... Anything more lightweight?

I just bought my own 0.80 BTC.  Looking to aquire 2.2 more :D (through purchases or tips.... ;))

download bitcoin-qt (wallet software) - it will create a wallet address for you (you can have multiple)
in order to potentially sell your BTC/exchange them with another altcoin i would recommend signing up and verifying with vault of satoshi (vaultofsatoshi.com) -- very quick verification and good support
in order of acquiring your first $200 of BTC i would strongly recommend localbitcoins.com if you are looking to acquite them sooner or later.  in order to put funds into vault of satoshi you need to mail them a check or money order ($15) so that will delay your entry into the market quite a bit whereas just downloading the wallet software and buying local will get you instant coins.
when you want to sell just transfer your BTC from your computer wallet to VoS exchange and sell to fiat if necessary!

Go to a free faucet website and get free bitcoins. I've made 0.001 from one of them after visiting it about 20 times
