Well, yeah. Same with banking everywhere, plus the mint system, armored car industries, etc. A lot of the consequences of full Bitcoin adoption would not be fun. It's a great idea, but I personally hope it just supplements fiat currencies. Living in a developing country, there's more of a problem of people not having any money at all, let alone a computer, let alone internet, to play with online currencies. Not everyone lives in the Valley.

This is the standard holiday shutdown. This always happens because here in China, even though the transfer happens electronically, the recording is done by hand. There's nothing unusual about this at New Year's. With regards to the domestic window, all that is legal holidays, and beyond that, most stores are closed. The international window is a little longer, probably because 80% of people in office settings take the whole week off. Notice that it only affects wiring money. You can still go to ATMs and make transfers by depositing into the other party's bank's ATM. Just the tellers' windows won't be open for the holiday. "system maintenance" is an excuse, yes, but not with the meaning of 
"hiding a financial crisis". It really means "we don't care to have backup staff".

No. Because when you're at the teller here in China, in back of them there's another group of people *hand copying* the transaction ledger on paper. They have hand drills like from an old factory for putting the copious paper together into books. Nothing is organized enough for that. It's just holiday shutdowns. On top of that, Gordon Chang has been screaming doom for his whole career.

I live here in China and have for 2.5 years. The exact same thing happened last year, although last year it was only 3 days due to the New Year holiday falling midweek. The weekend is what makes this so long, splitting it over 2 weeks.
