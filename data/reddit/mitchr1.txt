that makes sense, I think ill throw 500 bucks around into some well known alts... it couldnt hurt. I already have a good amount of a few, Dark, Blackcoin or Aero. I feel like dramatic gains in alts is still a very realistic possibility.

right, but if bitcoin is a massive success... wouldnt VC take a risk on another coin?

If bitcoin was at a stable price...then it would stay around that price, and therefore would not go to the moon.

well this is kind of new history, almost all of them came out after bitcoin began to fall last year.

Dont you think he deserves some credit from the community? An AMA would raise some awareness for what hes doing. His generosity is a great example of how great bitcoiners can be.

@_date: 2014-11-21 09:12:32
Nah man, I'd really like I know more about him. He's tipping up a storm. I think he's a legitimate bitcoin hero.
