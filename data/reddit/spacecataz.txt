yes but most business with dell is done on account with terms, even on small purchases

what are you paying above interchange? I have an offer at 8 basis points and I want to know if I can do better

Why would you wear a shirt with "bombs" on it while traveling? That's just asking for trouble.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:07:31
Doing this just gives the article more publicity, which is all the author wants. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:31:41
That's really the same thing. Just like screaming fire in a crowded theatre is perfectly fine right?
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:17:46
You are 100% allowed to travel with over $10k in cash, you just have to declare it. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:00:42
yes, I know clear and present danger. I was being sarcastic.

you wil not save money going fiat -&gt; btc -&gt; fiat compared to going fiat -&gt; fiat unless you are avoiding currency controls or breaking laws

I could have sworn the title said edible Blockchain. It actually sounds like a better idea.

It doesn't matter. The government doesn't have to ever pay back its debt. It isn't a household. we don't live in a Ricardian world. As long as it can service the debt it's fine. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 05:25:48
Actually the government doesn't ever have to pay down the principal. We don't live in a Ricardian world.

On the other hand many people have done really well with lending club. Who is doing collections or risk analysis for btc p2p lending?
It is probably best to stick with fiat here. 
@_date: 2011-05-20 21:07:12
Well 250 mhash/s gets about 1 btc a day so those numbers are pretty bad

The appreciation of the yen after the tsunami makes economic sense. Japanese investors with assets in other currencies need to convert them into yen. This increased the demand for yen driving the value up.

wouldn't trading bitcoins for goods be considered bartering because they are not a real currency
@_date: 2011-05-20 15:02:08
Actually FPGAs are all the rage these days but you have to write your own mining code. 
@_date: 2011-05-18 13:11:59
Maybe if they overheat, but then I would just rma it

Install logmein on your computer and you can just remote access it to fix any problems with the miners. You might need a dummy plug or to plug the 5850 into a monitor so it works. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 19:42:38
I've read it isn't worth it to self mine unless you are over 2ghash/s. I'm at 1.1ghash/s and I just use slush's or deepbit to get constant payouts. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:51:37
except you forget that FLOPS stands for floating point operations per second
and bitcoin does not use floating point operations...
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:31:19
Sure - look at the M2 graph, it's the same

I have 3 6970s - two in one machine, 1 in the other. I lowered the memory clock to 300 on the single one, it gives slightly lower temps, but I still get around 370 mhash/s per card (they are at 900mhz core)
@_date: 2016-05-10 08:18:17
Does no one remember TARP?
Look at how the money supply has already changed. 
And what was the result of this? The dollar is almost at all time highs (though slightly weaker than a few weeks ago)
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:32:38
I'm sure they will take wire transfers. Ask them. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 08:13:32
Has no one here heard of TARP?
This is exactly what we did to get out of the Great Recession. Look at how the money supply has grown in the past 10 years. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 08:16:52
Yes it is. Look at the change in the monetary base in the past ten years. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:52:50
Why not send a wire transfer instead? Only like $15. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 07:07:47
Wire transfers are instant, or at least for sure faster than an hour. They only take 5 days when someone is lying.

First of all don't worry about it because you are in middle school. High school grades are important so you can get into college, and college grades are important so you can get a job, but middle school doesnt really matter.
Also this should teach you an important lesson. Write what the teacher wants to hear. If you tell the teacher what they want to hear, you will get a good grade.

Businesses need government permission to wire money outside of china and they have to pay a 10% tax. 
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:51:56
No one that is currently mining wants more people to mine. I get it. But I ran the numbers and now it is profitable for me. I already have the cards.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:07:15
Sure but that only works with small amounts of cash. I don't think you could convert 1mm cny like that. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:19:14
converting cny to usd is not easy
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:29:46
sure well once the money is in HK, in cash or a bank account, you can do whatever you want with it. The problem is getting the money out of china. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 21:00:46
you would make more investing in asicminer
