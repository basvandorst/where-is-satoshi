We should really just relax.

Thanks for the tip. (I think it went through? I know gary_rowe's did [I got a message about it] but I'm new to the whole thing myself... ) 
Thanks for your Kickstarter support, by the way! We hope to have another this year. With a movie hopefully already (mostly) secured! Stay tuned. :)

We are working on integrating bitcoin as a currency/payment option for a future version of the site. Stay tuned!
EDIT: For now you can send us bitcoin directly at 197vgs8LRYiQ4Qd8hkLLoe2hQny6jk9BXE. If you already have an account and want to buy stuff with bitcoin, send us an email at support with your information, and we'll credit your account. But we hope to offer it as a payment option in the next few months.

Great idea! I'll pitch it to the guys. 
EDIT: Thanks for the bitcoins. I didn't see until after I'd replied, and then I couldn't edit my comment. You folks are fantastic.

I'll be sure to make it a priority. Thanks for your support in the meantime! :)

RiffTrax web guy here! 
Thanks for noticing our Bitcoin implementation. Currently we accept BTC only for donations: 
Our fans love the guys, their comedy and purchase content from our site, however sometimes fans accidentally run across something of ours on this here series of tubes, and donate in support of our mission to bring the funny. (Comedians love laughter and applause, so we've rigged a speaker in the studio with a laugh track and thunderous applause that goes off each time a donation is received.) Mike, Kevin and Bill love and truly appreciate the support, and knowing that fans are "doing the right thing." We're a small, independent company of 10 people and so every little bit counts.
BTC integration with the RiffTrax shopping cart for purchases and downloads is a bit more involved, and will be implemented in the not-too-distant future. We'll be sure to let everyone know once it's live.
Thanks for your support!

See my comment above! Right now we only accept BTC donations, but we hope to have a shopping cart implementation soon.
