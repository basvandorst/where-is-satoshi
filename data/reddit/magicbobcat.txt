Thanks. No people on local bitcoins and no ATMs near me. Without revealing location, I'm on a remote island so options are limited. Am happy to make international wire transfers anywhere in the world in any currency but not sure how to do it. Do I need to use something like perfect money? I checked out local bitcoins and saw people in other countries were accepting perfect money?

Thanks..yeah this is the annoying thing for me. Buying $20 bitcoin at a time doesn't help if I'm trying to move say $50,000 from fiat to bitcoin in chunks of $5,000-$10,000...
Hmm I would have thought some company would have figured out a way to get institutional investors on board to buy crypto?
But yeah like you said it hasn't been your concern since you live in US (and use coinbase I guess?). I have a US bank account that I could use but I'm not a citizen or resident there

Hmmm yeah but if I want to buy say 5k of bitcoin straight away I wouldn't know how to do it with someone on the main land. Isn't there any exchange or anything that will let me make international wire transfers to buy bitcoin?

Thanks. Is there literally no way to buy bitcoin via international wire transfer at an exchange then?
I was first looking into bitcoin in 2013 and I found it was hard to buy due to this reason...and it seems not much as changed since then?
This is making it hard for me to adopt bitcoin and I realize I have missed out on a lot of the initial growth already!
