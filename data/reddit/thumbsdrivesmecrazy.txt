You even do not need centralized exchanges (there are well known issues of big exchanges) due to development of open-source crypto-trading platforms and decentalized exchanges that provide coins the ability to list on their own exchange (based on coin owners trust to coin founders), like platform based on old 2014' Peatio platform open-source code.

Nowadays, we can adopt cryptocurrencies by trading crypto assets more easily via the development of open-source competitors of Coinbase - various crypto exchanges based on Peatio platform and other open-source platforms, such as r/rubykube to create an independent exchange service for trading and storing all ERC-20 tokens and MT-26 coins.

Check [Peatio Tech]( - it is a SaaS (rather "Peatio as a Service") service from [RubyKube]( founders for building your own crypto-exchange with dedicated RubyKube installation, configuration and continuous software maintenance.

I guess, [Coin.Market]( provides more accurate data because it works with trades data.
CoinMarketCap provides ticker data which tells you the following: price, 24h volume, market (xrp/usd, eth/btc, etc.) and exchange (binance, coinbase, bitstamp etc.)
Coin.Market provides trades data which tells you the following: price, amount traded, market (xrp/usd, eth/btc...), exchange (binanace, coinbase...), time, if the trade was a buy or a sell
So with trades you can calculate how much VOLUME was for 1 second, 5 minutes, 2 hours and so on.

[Coin.Market]( provide such more detailed trade data (not ticker data, like CMC), so you can calculate how much volume was for 1 second, 1 minute, or 1 hour and so on - you can also check how many trades were to get, for example, btc/usd in a selected price range on all exchanges or on one exchange.
