Just wondering did you split the coins from a Electrum wallet? or another wallet?

I'm just wondering how did you send your BTC from old Electrum wallet to a new Electrum wallet?  Did you send it from your old Electrum wallet address to your new Electrum wallet address and ate the transaction fee? Or did you import it or export it within the wallet?  Thanks

Thank you for the reply!!  Sorry I forgot to ask, just wondering on your old Electrum wallet before fork, it doesn't show any BCH balance and it's normal right?  In my pre fork Electrum wallet, it doesn't show any BCH balance, only a bTc balance.  Once again for your reply and time.

Hi folks,
Just wondering if someone can clarify the sending process from an old Electrum wallet to a new one from the "recommendation on how to redeem bitcoin cash" step 3 mentions "move all your electrum funds to a new electrum wallet"
Just wonder what's the best way to move these funds? Do I export the seed from the old electrum into the new electrum wallet? or import it or something? or do I send the old electrum wallet address with btc's to my new electrum wallet that has a new seed and eat a transaction fee? Sorry I'm new to electrum wallet and I'm still unsure of this step. Thank you in advance for the help.

Thank you for your time and help!!  On my before fork Electrum wallet, I only see a BTC balance and don't see any BCH balance or anything, is this normal?  I plan on creating a new electrum wallet with a new seed, after I do that, how do I "import" the key?  I don't see an option for "importing" but only exporting.  Should I send my btc with the "send" function from the pre fork wallet to after fork wallet, or is there a way to import the seed from pre fork wallet to post fork wallet? (Sorry I just don't see this "import" function" in my electrum wallet.  Thank you again for your time and reply, I really appreciate it.
