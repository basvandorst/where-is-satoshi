*"link to some developer sites"*
did anyone bother to follow those links?  It appears to be the personal anonyous website of some random russian computer guy.

have you heard of ConfuseCoin?  the algorithm is so confusing no one can even discuss it, let alone break it.  also: it's open source.

I dont think they understand either.  There is simply no way the US authorities can control this.

you think Coinbase has that sort of legal budget?  and if they don't catch every single person using their trademark theyre somehow guilty?
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:09:50
protected?  people imitate and rip off much more valuable brands all the time.
