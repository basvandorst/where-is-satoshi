Not true.    Don't drink the kool aid.  25% is just a made up number a web site posted.     Why would they wait till last  moment to kill it ?     It's happening or some version of it

I agree I feel safe with coinbase with my 2 coins for now.    So much hate towards them but I am not one of those "keep my cash under the mattress because I don't trust banks" kind of guy.    
I have multi Sig / password / and 4 digit code.   
Yes , I know I don't own my keys but do I own my cash after I give it to the bank either?     Of course anything can happen.  
I trust coinbase more than something that has not been around long enough and looks like the cheap mp3 i got 20 years ago.   
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:27:23
Coinbase.    Even with all the bad reviews here 
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:17:54
If approved it goes to $2177.    If not , drops to 900 and we start slow climb back to where it is today.   
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:46:36
Or just one thing goes well and it goes to 2000 and that becomes the new bottom floor ...    with 3000-5000 by next 2 years.       Then who knows ??   Is 10000 really out of the question?      I am not even being stupid optimistic .

Think this is good for the reputation of coinbase .    Shows how they would handle problems on a major scale.      Disputes all those drama panic posts that claim you will wake up one day and coinbase just vanished.       Not sure I can say the same for smaller lesser known wallets 
And not comparing it to hard of paper wallets.     
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:01:45
Not just a old thing ?    I am also very new to bitcoin and 90% of the inner working of it doesn't make sense to me either.       I know my bitcoin balance is $700 higher then when I first started 3 months ago ..   so I know that's a good thing!!!       Don't be fooled though.   Many many people are not sure of the in and outs of bitcoin.     I suspect the same can be said for banking though.       It is fun though huh?
Much more exciting than some boring stock that might make 3% per year if your lucky.

Your theory only applies to have many coins you started with.       For some one with half a coin , what's the point of coming this far to make a small profit.     Grow a pair and take a chance.

@_date: 2017-03-20 00:08:10
I feel safer using coinbase after reading this statement.    
Nobody knows what will happen if the fork happens .
Rather have a wait and see attitude.
If that means I have to wait a day or two to deposit or withdrawal , so be it.     
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:25:21
Is this any safer than coinbase to hold a few coins in?   
If so, why ?

Look at 3 , 6 , or 12 month charts.   
Hardly a reason to worry.    
Do you expect it to go up everyday ?   Who predicted 1200 this soon after the rejection ?
Chill , it's all good baby 
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:47:27
As soon as you posted , the price rose $40.

@_date: 2017-03-12 02:29:56
Be ready to be amazed then.
You must be one of those "it's going to crash to 400 !!! Dudes "    it's stronger than u think and getting stronger every day.    
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:41:35
It was never going to hit 1300-1400 before the announcement regardless..     it's right where it should be now.      Between 1000 - 1200.       Ruling in favor will at least double that.     Ruling against drops it to 800-900 and we start the climb up again.     
Win - win for me.     Unless you bought at 1250 or higher , should be for you too ..
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:39:48

Never been more optimistic about the future of bitcoin.

It will happen...   
 but that's not really what's it's all about ...

I never had any of the common Coinbase panic responses posted here daily.      I am glad to see at least 1 post with something positive to say about them.  
I understand I don't actually own my keys etc etc etc 
On the other hand ... how many posts do we see daily with 
"I think I did something stupid , my coins are gone " 
I never had  to worry about writing one of those posts with coinbase .  
I know customer service usually sucks   
So I am glad you figured it out , I am sure you had a mini panic attack.

I had similar thing happen.   Won $2500 getting a royal flush playing video poker.    Had to withdrawal in bitcoins when the price was only $760 a few months ago.  If it stays above that, it's all profit for me.    So watched the price go up to $1300 and back down to what it is today.       
I believe the price with continue to rise over time.    It will also fall at some points , like now.     
Overall , it continues its path up ...
Don't look at 24hour charts (drive you nuts) 
Just open up 3, 6, 12 month charts ...
It keeps going up ... even after all the So-called horrible news and etc surrounding it.       Imagine if there is a string of good news soon ?   
Which game did you win your jackpot with ?
Congrats, trust me I know good it feels.

@_date: 2017-03-25 01:23:41
Buy !!   You will always regret it if you don't.   
Right now bitcoin is going through power control changes.
That's why the dip .    Don't be discouraged though.   
The more you read , the more it will confuse you.    
Nobody really knows anything.      People that sold will say "I told you so"    people that hold will say "I told you so"  ..
Fact is bitcoin is the future .....
There is no doubt that the price is being driven down now for big investors (whales) to come scoop up big amounts for a great price.      Then you will hear nothing but good positive news about bitcoin again ....  then back towards $2000 and beyond.    
Best investment out there.  
Go for it

Have a feeling that $3200 will be gone if you decide to hold it for a year.       Since your a gambler , it makes it way too easy to deposit more $ into the casino account over time ... and they know you made $3200 , so you will never win that back again.

Or buy now since we will see 1300 as the floor starting next week 
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:03:08
Cool.   That's the way I looked at it too.   
If your not 100% committed to bitcoin as a long term investment , but also not willing to gamble it will rise before you need the cash , then cash out everything but 1 bitcoin.   
This way you can enjoy a  big chunk of the casino winnings, plus have 1 bitcoin left in the game in case it does increase and you don't feel like you missed out.   
I personally bought plane tickets and hotels rooms I needed to buy anyway ..  didn't have to worry about getting actual cash in hand.  (Which will cost you more of your profits)    
A variety of other things can be bought via bitcoin that would be just as good as cash if out of pocket expenses for you.   
They do make it difficult getting cash without ripping you off .
Good luck.    You are playing with houses $$ now

You will never "lose" it.     Question is if you need the $ now.     If so, sell and never look back.     
There is no question is will rise over time.  
How long that will take is anyone's guess .
Look at the 6 months , 1 year charts instead of the 24 hour charts.   
Trust me, nobody can risk losing their $$.

Think it will take $200-$300 dip if rejected.      It was rising before all this hype happened and will not fold if it doesn't happen.        Everyone that joined the bandwagon will pull out and all the die hard people will be there to snatch up cheap coins.     Either way , Its going to $2000 before falling below $800.      So relax and its a win win either way if you can be patient .

I bought at 760 USD .    So I did make some money that I originally planned on using that profit for a trip.     
I now feel guilty about using any of my coins.   
I truly believe the price will only go up over time.   Even with the dips that will of course happen .
I do not have a load of disposable income so part of me feels like I should spend some .
I would feel too dumb though if the price goes up to life changing highs.  
Right now if lost it all , it would totally suck.  
But wouldn't change my life ..
There's a chance my few coins could change my life 10/20/30 years from now. ..
That's why I will not spend until the price goes to life changing.   
That price is different to all of us.   
Some it's 3000, others 500,000

So sick of these posts.    
"Coinbase closed my account for NO reason"
"Maybe because of this reason?"
"I didn't want coinbase anyway " 
You do something shady, your account will be closed.   
Not so hard to understand

The price is right where the charts said it would be at this time.     Just accept the price might actually be corrected already.

@_date: 2017-04-27 14:25:08
Difference this time is the price will go from $1600 by announcement time and "crash" down to $1300.   
I will take that 
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:51:49
Dip is now .... just going higher each day.      You already lost $100 per coin by not buying last week ....

What if I take 2 coins from coinbase and transfer them to a Trezor?      Does it look like i spent them to the IRS? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:15:08
Why does everyone say coinbase closed their account "for No reason"      then they tell you "well maybe for this reason"  then say "I didn't need or want them anyway"    ...
I am glad coinbase is more selective and has tougher rules.  
  
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:59:24
You can't have it both ways .. say it's the future but not "ready" for the present.   
Of course it will have growing pains in retail at first.

Just as what happens ever when every new "issue" arises with bitcoin..
Some whimps will overreact and sell .
Then those same people will see they were cowards and buy back in.    
So expect a price drop , followed by a large increase .
Just another day 
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:51:01
30% postings of people losing their coins by trying to open wallets sending / receiving by themselves becaus they are paranoid to use coinbase.   
Coinbase is a safe place to keep and use small amounts of coins for the average beginner....  why do they have millions and millions of users.       All stupid ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:47:38
No.     Your coins will be fine .
Price might take a dip because people like to get paranoid .
This will be temporary as those same people buy back into bitcoin after they see they made a mistake.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:49:23
So you did nothing shady what so ever ?
Not even something that might seem shady?

Let it "crash" down to $1500 If necessary.  
Still looking upward

Doesn't make them shit ....

Keep key is the best option out there at the moment.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:16:20
I have a new unused keep key that a bought last month.  
I am glad I didn't transfer my coins onto it yet ...
It makes no sense that they did not put out any response to these questions. 
I would understand if they ran out of product and even lack of customer service (like many bitcoin businesses Coinbase , etc)    but to just disappear during this time is unacceptable.      
Reputation is everything.   
Every hour that goes by without some kind of statement is very worrying to say the least.  
I hope I am wrong or I have a $99 useless keychain

You lost me at "blowing up" and "killing it"
Lose to dumb hat and grow up to be taken seriously
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:01:27
Update ...
Keep key reps emailed me and said there is no issues with using it.       They are just out of stock and are in the process of making more.       
Makes me feel better .
I emailed them and got a response within an hour ...

You would think any "announcements" 
Good or bad would be made before August 1 .
Crazy and concerning they are silent since they know many people are freaking out.  
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:29:29
I also own a keep key and asked the same questions 
And here's their official statement:
"KeepKey is alive and well, though we are going through some restructuring, with all the communication and operational challenges that comes along with that. I can't go into the all of the details now, but there will be some announcements soon (good announcements). Funds stored by your KeepKey or Multibit are safe, there have been no compromises or anything similar.
We are working hard to make more KeepKeys."
So I don't think trezor or any other hard wallet is any safer to keep your coin for long term .
But it is frustrating to keep hearing there is no problem from keep key as each month goes by without them appearing to still be in business .  ?? 
   So answer is I think it is safe ....
Wish someone official can explain why in more detail .
If you find anything out, please respond .....
     Between coinbase and keepkey , Its like they are begging us to leave them 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:17:02
You already lost $80 per coin by being "iffy" since $1800

Agree.   
How do the same weak people keep falling over a over and panic selling.  
Just look at the 6 months , 1 year chart 
What part looks like holding is a bad option ?
We are just at the beginning too .
Remember when we hit $1300 (all time high) and everyone was so positive .
Now we are at $2400 after a rocky rd and people actually are talking about giving up.   
Crazy 
Expect $4000 by Oct .

I would rather just buy another one .
Also when the new keepkeys are out , will they be different

Yes.    Will get back to $3,000 before going down to $2000

Thought  $3000 was too soon too fast.  
$2200 - $2500 seems about right .
Do not expect it to go below $2000 without lots of support.
Even with the August 1 hysteria I see it back above $3000 mid August.     Then $4000 + before end of Summer.  
Buy now ,  hold 4 months and make some $$$ .
Or panic , sell now ... then feel dumb later and buy back in .
Either way, Its going to keep rising .
