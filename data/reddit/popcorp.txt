It is § 239 2 a) - you should not refuse national currency. But it is the same thing you can see during most of music festivals  or big events, where vendors won't accept money, and you buy stuff with some chips/tokens sold by the organizer.

I too lost some btc due to a malware which probably stole a backup of the android bitcoin wallet from my phone. Completely unexpected, address was only about week old. Coins went straight to a tumbler. There are things going on in a cybercrime world we can barely imagine. Price of coins is of great motivation and as you have said, if an IT professional can't secure his stash, ordinary user is in a big trouble.
I hope there will be a hardware solution soon, i use an airgapped computer to generate paperwallets now, but it isn't ideal.

Maybe, but in that case Mark's military-grade m-of-n key cold storage code would be useless. Thousands of lines of code lost!

The only way for China to get a foothold in a cc space is to buy everything they can before the worldwide adoption kicks in. They can't or don't want to innovate, they are not building infrastructure. Chinese big guys are just investing while using scare tactics to hoard as much as possible.

Sorry for your loss. I had some bitcoins stolen from my phone due to unencrypted backup of private keys on sdcard. I even had no suspicious apps installed. Never found the attack vector.
Lesson learned: I no longer store privkeys on my phone. I keep most of my coins in paper wallet generated on an offline computer.

tl;dr he went full retard with stolen btcs. Probably sold them on an exchange and transferred funds to **his very own** bank account. He then used cash to buy a house and made his grandad an owner. House and his account are now freezed and he is under investigation for money laundering.

It is not difficult to automate most of the things - if attacker has access to ten thousands of phones, chances are he will find vulnerability in some of them.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:50:52
Thankfully these weren't money i depend on. I made these on litecoin speculation and i really lost 2 BTC i bought last week. I am still in profit with bitcoin, so no reason to cry my eyes blind.
I made this post because more and more people are using mobile wallets, and if the bitcoin community won't find a good solution to bitcoin's security, ordinary users will be losing their money -- which obviously isn't very healthy for cryptocoin ecosystem overall.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:29:38
Hell, why not? 
It is the same question as if you asked why would anyone put 100k USD to a random uninsured exchange ran by  unknown russian guys -- regardless of the answer, btc-e thrives. Some people using localbitcoins operate with such volume every day, some of them not even using escrow.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:59:39
No, i bought the phone at the end of september and updated the system regulary.

@_date: 2013-11-28 19:03:39
OP here
I think I can rule out the PRNG bug, because i generated the key last week, so it should be secure. Event with a weak key, if i understand the PRNG attack correctly, there has to be a transaction originating from the unsecure address. But i just received the money, i've never send anything from this address.
So someone was able to steal my private key somehow..
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:39:11
so what is your advice here?
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:33:38
I installed a firewall and amount of connections to China showing in the log file is insane. 
I also use swift key flow. Coincidence?
By any chance, have you had any backups done by the stock MIUI app?
@_date: 2013-07-18 09:50:10
I'll be probably visiting Iran in september.
It would be great if i could avoid bringing my whole traveller's budget in USD and use bitcoin for buing Rials instead. :] 
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:54:28
jgarzik, while i admit he is a great developer and btc enthusiast, clearly know nothing about politics and outcomes of current sanctions against iran. BTC may help many Iranians abroad to transfer money from/to families in an exile.
Secondly, BTC has nothing to do with politics of any country, and is free to use for anyone, am i not right?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:28:43
This seems to be the same case as mine.
EDIT: not. I didn't reinstall the wallet. Just as the payment went in, it went out after few minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:40:35
yes, they do. Maybe Google had removed them from the store because they realized these apps are full of crap.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:51:32

I'm sorry for your loss. Me too lost 10 btc two days ago probably due to some malware in android, but I really have only a vague idea how my phone could be hacked. Attacks these days are getting sophisticated and bitcoin community should be very proactive preventing this.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:49:22
I made an encrypted backup of keys to google drive.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:09:31
the backup contains both the pub and private key. I believe all you need is private key, from which the pubkey can be derived.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:26:20
The phone (Mi2S with official system) is rooted. I do not use untrusted apps, everything was installed from google play or F-Droid.
I ran AVG antivirus through but it didn't find any threats.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:05:15
BTC went straight to tumbler, just look into the blockchain. I think guy behind the attack knows his shit well :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:30:58
I do use paper wallet whenever i know i won't be using the coins for weeks. But you'd expect some security in the device you are using daily, won't you?
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:40:44
I am also Czech. I do not receive any utility bills, gas + electricity + rent  is agreed on a yearly contract, have a prepaid cell phone, only paper bill I receive is a yearly insurance statement.
What I did is I printed monthly invoice from the ISP (which I receive as pdf monthly) , and took a photo of that with my phone. Was verified within few hours with no problem.
I believe any reasonable looking paper will be enough, you may have some letters from your uni/dorm invoice, house savings (you can erase balance), ... just ask bitstamp staff, I am sure they will be able to help you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:35:14
That's why i made a backup.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:53:04
I use development version of MIUI (updated every week). Perhaps they didn't update the PRNG code, but i'd doubt it.
Is it possible to check the PRNG function somehow?
What is interesting, they only stole the transaction i made today. They left about 0.8 BTC i previously had in the wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:47:31
following apps have had a root permission:
- (Discontinued) SSH Server II from shk.schneider (no longer at the market)
- AdAway (from F-DRoid repo)
The only suspicious app is:
maybe there is a zero day in the android.. can't think of any other way how could malicious app gain access to other app's data
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:12:25
It seems this is the case. I sent bitcoins to a new clean address (created sometimes around maybe last week).
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:26:45
two apps i'd consider "shady" are
the rest are apps from google or recognized developers. Maps, reddit reader, yr.no weather widget, battle.net auth, solCalendar... I do not install every single crap from google play.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:08:47
please see the OP
Attacker most probably stole my keys from unencrypted backup of my app's data. Unfortunately I don't know which app could've done this.
At least, as long your private keys are safe within the wallet's sandbox, you should be safe. Unless there is an app with root privileges, of course.
