Especially after the $60 million hack

Literally look at any of the older news about bitcoin. Look at how many coins were seized with the Silk Road takedown. Drugs are the primary transactions taking place with cryptos now and for the foreseeable future
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:45
Yeah but this time the house is me so it's okay ^/s
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:04
Hopefully by that point Bitcoin is an actual currency and there is no exchange rate anymore
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:01:42
If everyone uses bitcoin, what exactly will they lend out for fractional reserve? They can't send more bitcoin than they have, they have to use a different currency, as I stated above
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:19:15
This is what I've been telling people. I'm all for cryptocurrency and whatnot, but it's not going to be the revolution people are expecting.

Holy shit I laughed hard at the airport at those names for a crash. Definitely keeping "angry shoulder" in my vocab
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:12
Yeah, I've been buying in a little bit at a time since the beginning of this year instead of stocks. I had planned on having 10 btc by the end of the year, but now it's looking like I might only get 3 or 4 lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:42
They can still buy in $100 and only lose $50, it's just vastly less likely. Hell if bitcoin 'only' goes from $16k to $17k in the next 'year' it will still beat basically every market. While the 10 bazillion percent gains are amazing, it will stabilize here eventually.... I hope

Pfft, only 72m, that's like amateur hour over here.
 I bet that was some hedgefund trader who just earned a promotion this year
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:24:23
Because the winklevii (I don't know if that was intentional but I like that name for them lol) aren't making 'transactions' just like most people aren't making any. Probably 70% of the people who bought in recently (myself included)are just holding and hoping the value will go up. Very few non-drug "transactions" are actually taking place
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:01
That's very true, I tend to be very conservative with my money, so I forget sometimes that people go crazy when they see dollar signs
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:43
I just want it to hold at $15k for like the rest of Dec. I almost have a whole coin but they keep raising the bar :(
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:44:41
Loans and financing will still have to go through banks, but banks will no longer be in complete control of your non-loan savings
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:17:23
I'm unsure how much you know about fractional reserve, but the basic gist is that banks can lend out 10x the amount of money they actually have in reserve,  because there are measures in place to stop a bank run. What this means is that a bank can collect interest on 10 loans for the price of 1. With blockchain currencies, they can't lend out more money than they have, unless it's in a different currency, so they either need to foster a culture of having many different types of currencies, one which they control, or just lend out only what they actually have. It's not an easy problem to solve, especially with how integral debt is to American society in particular

And what's the biggest thing for the darknet services atm? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:19
I mean, they probably weren't expecting the price to go up 10 billion percent along with all the attention that brings
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:55
What do you mean where will they get enough? The same way any non-bank would, by investing and collecting interest on previous loans. The only difference is that they wouldn't be able to rely on fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:32:04
I wish I could do stuff like this, instead all I have is a minimum wage job and college debt
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:50:18
"$700 is the moon" guys we already hit Jupiter at this point, next stop Andromeda!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:08
That's because most people here weren't invested in crypto until it hit $10k, for them all it is, is an asset
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:30:11
I thought you said '19 coins' at first and was like DUDE sell and get treatment wtf. 
Best of luck, regardless of the outcome, stay strong.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:51
I mean, more replaced our current currencies, if it hits 10 million a coin and there's still trillions of USD in circulation I'd probably pay someone to beat me up because this is the weirdest dream ever
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:11
I just want it to hold at $15k for a little bit so I can actually buy some more lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:55
But the point is that they can invest with a very small amount of money, sure they lost 97% if it somehow crashes to 500, but that still means they only lost $97 dollars

That's why the coins are divisible to the billionth place, it can deflate for quite a long time before 1 sat is unusable 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:53:09
Someone or something is pumping the value right now. The consensus among people who aren't blinded by dollar signs is that it's Chinese whales hiding money from the government.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:00
That's what I figured, I was just wondering if there was anything in the rumour mill
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:06:49
Electricity is around $0.05 where I am, so that's why I was looking at getting into it. It put me at a breakeven date of around 110 days. What are genesis mining contracts?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:50:38
That's because finance is a zero-sum game. You have to take money from someone else
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:25:13
While I figured I would get a lower RoI than buying coins, I'm also not hurting for money. I'm more interested in supporting the network and just want to make sure it wasn't like 400+ days to break-even haha
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:25:48
Anywhere that I can read about that?
