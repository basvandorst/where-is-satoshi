Whaaaaa? I think we're talking about different things. Investments are only as good as they are useful to the individual. If I have $10b at the end of my life but live out of a subaru wagon and eat ramen, what's the point? Sure, my return might have been better than all of the other "strategies" would give me, but what's the point of it all? Greed? Some kind of world domination? All-or-nothing strategies aren't very secure, and most people look to gaining wealth for security reasons. So it makes sense to divide assets, especially into venues that have real world use.
I didn't suggest employing this strategy across all investments, I am suggesting that it is wise to do for highly volatile ones. Which cryptocurrency certainly is at the moment.

Well in many cases those countries' currencies are more volatile than Bitcoin, so while dips are worrisome they are better than the alternative...

You'd be surprised at how many people in third world countries have cell phones.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:14:28
Sure.. which would certainly be unsettling. I'm suggesting that the alternative for them is no funds because of gov't confiscation or similar. So their options are to 1) worry about the volatility of Bitcoin or 2) worry *even more* about the volatility of their fiat currency.
While option 1 isn't enviable, it's the best option they've got.

Well I agree with that to some extent. But the people in this situation aren't investing, they're using Bitcoin as currency. They should be worried... but in theory it's better than the alternative. Why would they sell at the dips if their gov't is taking their money?

It is neither a fallacy or poor investment. It is a level of diversification. "Investments" don't help you if you are in debt or have psychological stress from losing the fiat you have put in. Going all in is riding it all on black: you have more to gain but also can lose it all. If you take your initial investment out and roll the rest on black you can only win, albeit by not as much if it hits the moon. The latter, I would suggest, is more responsible balance of life compared to gambling all of your assets in one optimistic go.

Anyone suggesting that success is anything more than luck is in over their head. There's no discernible "dip" to be able to buy, except in hindsight.

Sure, the more general the predictions the less likely you'll be wrong. The bet you gave me has an infinite timeframe and no opportunity cost. Of course I'd be an idiot to take it :)
What you can't tell me is the odds you'll give me that it *does* land on the edge. Or what other bets are happening at the moment. If I were to give you $1 for every flip that lands on a side, but you have to give me $1,000,000 every time it lands on the edge... is that a good bet? Similarly, how about I bet you $10 that bitcoin drops to 0 but you have to give me a million if it does before hitting 7,000. Now how confident is the prediction, and how worth it is the bet? 
I think we're on the same page; I just think people quickly confuse support for bitcoin into outrageous speculation.

There could also be a big downturn, or a big upturn, or it could stay the same for two years! It's all speculation! Let's pretend to be experts and time the market! Is it a market or a new financial paradigm! Nobody knows!
Anyways, congrats OP

It's not the same in that on a roulette wheel the odds are known on a roulette wheel. 
\&gt;20K will seem very cheap within three years
You don't know the future. This is terrible, \*terrible\* delusion. It very well could be that bitcoin is at 200K in three years. But the point is that you don't know. The best thing to be is realistic and honest. 
Now, keep in mind I'm not disagreeing with your prediction: I own bitcoin and think it will continue to grow in value and acceptance. But my biggest pet peeve is that people who are touting the benefits can't seem to wrap their mind around the basic principles of investing.
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:15:07
Because you can't see into the future? That's like asking why you would walk off a Vegas roulette wheel after getting 10,000 on your 1,000.
Bitcoin is a highly fluctuating market. You remember that guy that sold at 18.5K last December and bought a house? Even if bitcoin goes up to 100K in a couple of years, he's got a house right now. There's a balance between greed and living your life.

But you can't guarantee anything. It's all speculation! It's a gamble and no one knows the odds! 
@_date: 2018-08-07 14:29:31




Contradictory statements... It's all a gamble. The odds aren't even known. One of the reasons you have the potential to make so much money is that it's a risky investment. It hasn't stabilized yet. It's no Proctor and Gamble or Mcdonalds.

Say I want to buy $1000 of Bitcoin. I 1) Order a Trezor from Amazon, 2) wait for it to show up 3) Buy Bitcoin on an exchange such as Coinbase 4) Just transfer the Bitcoin to the hardware? 
After I do this I understand that the Bitcoin is all in one place in my control. How do do you backup the hardware in case of loss or damage? Is this solution more for long term storage or for using as a proper currency?
Thanks for all of the replies and info- this thread is amazing.

Great, thanks! One tiny follow up question: you would recommend storing on a digital wallet over an exchange, right? The security weakness there is more along the lines of key loggers and weak passwords?
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:03:12
you got it. I already use 2FA and encrypted keypass passwords for everything else so it's ingrained habit.

Neither. The student loan market is in the bigger bubble.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:56:42
Not as strictly defined, but it'll have the same effect when everyone defaults. The prices of tuition are artificially high mostly due to interest rates and federal loans. It's really college tuition that's in a bubble.
And buyer's remorse isn't a bubble, but it sure as hell happens after every bubble pops.

I think tulips give Bitcoin a run for their crown:
