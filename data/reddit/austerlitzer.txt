I already countered this
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:31
emm no that's over complicating it. the market roughly determines an estimate. if above the estimate it reacts one way and if not it reacts another. As I said cryptos don't have these indicators to judge value.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:12:16
I’m lucky when I first got into cryptos a month ago I immediately made profit. Even with this dip I have a 50% return from a previous 100%. That’s how I perceive the risk. I can take another major dip back to $8000 before going into the red.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:52
I think that is amicable. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:52:03
I mean it goes both ways. They'd have to kill you to think you won't reciprocate. Hacking in bitcoin is a double edged sword.

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:43:57
because past price action isn't indicative of future performance especially in an asset like crypto that doesn't produce anything. It's irresponsible to tell people just to hold an asset and they will make money. That's contradictory to value investing and irresponsible. With that mentality people would have held on to stocks that burst after the dot com boom, but guess what, many of those stocks still haven't reached all time highs (Verizon and BT for example). It's just blind faith.

initially bought in at 9k on a dip and just bought more at 19k -.- that was using profits from other cryptos. I just suggest you buy on the dip. Bought at 18k thinking it wouldn't drop, but just bought more at 12k and already recovering like dat gucci gang. Dollar cost averaging works.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:04:26
Sure I’m not saying I don’t have a lot to learn but I’ve been dedicated to at least reading up the white papers so I can know the tech I speak of. I am also well aware how bcash is a fork of bitcoin.  Plus I think you can’t transfer if on segwit.

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:45:20
honestly people could rush back into cryptos and buy on the dip in fear that they missed out on the discounts. Crypto markets are already in the green for the day and haven't really gone too far down. The worse of the crash came and now we will see the anxious amateur investors in coinbase piling in. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:28:59
this will go on for some time...
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:15:35
ummm dude I am sorry but there is plenty of empirical on what Friedman said and how the global economies reacted to free floating exchange rates. You can just look at the relationship between deficits, surpluses, employment rate, and output levels. Also look at the mathematical Solow-Swan model. This academic paper literally gives all the evidence there is.  
Also in political economy it is proven by the concept of cost-of-adjustment. It is highlighted by the evidence in how surplus countries like Germany have negated output in other EU countries and how German tight monetary policy has affect interest rates and speculation in other countries. 
So yes I will make those snarky comments, because so far you have come up with all theory and no evidence. I am literally giving you peer reviewed academic literature backed by data and maths. You are giving me reddit internet opinion and conflating the two.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:06
I am sorry but I couldn't help it. You have great moves.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:41:44
looks like someone doesn't understand monetary policy. what next, a return to the gold standard? XD
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:37:37
too much savings is bad for national account balances. Also a deflationary currency is very bad for combating economic stagnation, debt control, or recessions. Let me guess you are a libertarian that thinks markets are efficient?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:15:41
not really because some currencies like stellar have an inflation pool that sorta creates illusion. And even with dilution you usually retain the same market value after the dilution compared to what you invested in before. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:19:50
paint or something else? It's really good!
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:34:44
Yes I never said every large cap pays dividends I said that most do. 
'A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, paid to a class of its shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property.'
who the hell do you think votes for those board of directors?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:33:18
so my point still stands that most large caps usually pay dividends.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:46:11

This story has very dubious sources except the supposed family portrait more than a century after. Also the British were losing the Battle of Waterloo up until about 7 pm at the same day. This wasn't necessarily a pump and dump since he was supposedly selling, not necessarily pumping up the price. He bought securities at low prices. Many banks do these, so what? Also where are your sources?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:44:50
Shorting requires margin which makes risk reward incredibly risky. You don't have to short to call it. Fucking ell.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:40:28
fuck me. I got into cryptos a month ago but the comments I hear are some next level idiocy. I hear about people losing their money on exchanges because they didn't do basic 2fa on their account and got hacked, or this type of shit. How could you send bitcoin to a bitcoin cash account? They aren't the same thing. Mind you, I am not wishing you ill or to lose your money, but you really can't blame Kraken for that. If you'd understand the blockchain technology you'd know you made a mistake and you'd have to deal with it (I am not saying this in a rude way I am trying to be polite). For example I forgot to send a memo with my ripple to cex.io once but thankfully it didn't go through because I left it blank. I've heard stories of people just typing in a random memo and accidentally sending it to a random account. Long story short: If you are going to invest in something, at least research the very basics. Mistakes happen and take this as a wake up call to learn more. I don't like the idea of people losing their money without any knowledge. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:05:40
I originally bought in at $9k for most currencies but closed my positions around $19k and re-bought at that price level. Oh dear.. I bought again at $18k and have just bought more at $13k. Dollar cost averaging is working.

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:34
let me edit that for you:
a debt-driven economy with high debt to gdp (over 100%) is bad for the economy because you have less monetary flexibility to counter this debt accumulation (you can't just lower interest rates all the time because the market will correct excessive moves). QE has been a 50/50 outcome. It was needed to stop the deflationary spiral after the recession however it has not worked because it has been concentrated in the hands of wealthy investors and has not been reinvested into the economy as intended. However, QE or debt do not necessarily mean you are kicking a can down the road. Even with a pegged currency based on a scarce resource (Gold) creates inequalities that mimic debt. In the Bretton woods system national account balances experienced difficulty in reaching an equilibrium and markets usually were more risk tolerant, resulting in market shocks to foreign exchange. To an extent I do not want to say account balance equilibrium is zero-sum, but usually countries with large surpluses take away output and employment from deficit countries. So that essentially shows that excessive savings + exports isn't good for global economic health. I agree with the last point you made but a fixed system isn't going to fix that.

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:59:54
lol this is the most idiotic post I've heard in the day. Most stock returns of investment are through dividends. Most major companies pay dividend and those are the same companies that exist in ETF's. Non paying dividend companies are usually small to mid cap or budget airlines like ryanair. They cannot decide to stop paying dividends unless the majority of shareholders agree to it. And why would they? They would be losing money by doing so, so no that's not how it works at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:06:21

that does not automatically warrant these valuations
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:32:38
having a majority of the voting power in a company doesn't mean it is a pump and dump it just makes it democratic relative to the principal investment contributed. Also many large caps don't have one single majority owner. Mind you many are dominated by a few institutions but those same institutions have the same interests than you. They can pump and dump but that only works very short term because stocks are guided by fundamentals. Also no the person with majority stock share is not usually the head of the company. The board usually takes care of that and nominates the CEO and his time. This only applies to startups or smaller companies. There are some exceptions to this.
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:51:02

fiat currency is actually valued based on numerous metrics: 
CPI inflation report
PMI reports
GDP Growth reports
Job and Payroll reports
Monetary policy
To say fiat is purely off of consensus is an incredibly naive lack of knowledge in political economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:33:23
there are less than 100 companies on that list. Also 20 of those companies are mid cap. I literally stated large caps not mid caps.

lol I don't think econometrics is 100% fact which is why I didn't rely on the mathematically model exclusively but as a secondary theoretical source. Also are you telling me interest rates aren't facts, or that unemployment, account balances aren't facts?

I own crypto but not understanding some of the peoples concerns shows how dogmatic the crypto community is. You CANNOT have a usable currency that is so volatile. Bitcoin is an asset not a currency. Countries would literally be shooting themselves in the foot if they started using it fully. People need liquidity and right now Bitcoin sadly doesn't provide that. If people actually care about crypto adoption they have to change their approach from amateur investing (Moon bla bla) to discussing fundamentals. Half of the people here just post memes about price targets. No wonder people don't take us seriously.

Inb4 someone mentions Eron.
Companies by themselves offer no value unless they produce something or provide a service that has utility in the market place. It is VERY different to the speculative demand with crypto. Companies make products that we can actively use and sometimes even need, however Bitcoin is purely driven by potential future demand rather than current demand.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:38:48
the amount of confidence in you is next to delusional
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:09:54


you can say inb4 after someone says something as a way of making fun of a point.
Also the utility of bitcoin and companies is simply not the same. you can measure a company's demand with so many metrics and financial statements. Bitcoin is simply based on future possibilities of demand. Also it is trying to fulfill something that is impossible (replacing fiat). I have crypto but it is just an irrational comparison comparing consumer goods with a method of wealth exchange.
