Where does he says that?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:09:24
They don't say so they say you can't distinguish from two different chain, if somebody with 90% of the coin at the beginning spend them all and after a time T he return and want to use them: he can simulate all successive blocks and then you can't distinguish his chain from actual chain without asking to a "friend".
This basically it's the same as saying (as in the paper in first comment  that you can't have a blockchain consensus mechanism based on who own coins, since basically you get into  and it can't work by definition.

It seems the final decision is on "users" unfortunately there are no users just stake, you fall again in the same problem.
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:23:49
That's too obvious. The point now it's all about creating the possibility to mine proof of stake, like take your money into an hub with a lot of other, and be sure to have them back, since obviously normal proof of stake doesn't necessitate mining, since it's embedded into the system; with LN instead you have to be in a big node to have some traffic and so some revenue, you can't just open an hub of 10 btc...
PS I just find it a sensationalist way of presenting it since it's not really bitcoin, it's an embedded system on it, like if I do a website to make loans with bitcoin and somebody says, Bitcoin is going to be like fiat money! That's not true, obviously.

Actually the blockchain isn't god, you can't believe in it, you can find it useful, or an implementation of a good idea for storing unchangeable data, if you believe in a system created to minimize trust you do not understand, and yes, you probably previously works on political propaganda.

And more importantly ignore that even changing a parameter doesn't change nothing - other than centralizing - in fact also with 10x or 1000x it can't even allow call of duty on leetcoin, or a single social network of transaction, more, this change will be (as planned) really slow. So they don't actually solve nothing also if we have now a 1000x of blocksize, but they create an huge problem of centralization, destroying the very core of bitcoin.

So, at that electricity cost it's 60000*175557117/575000=18'319'000 USD, or 610'000 per day! So, because we have now have a [2'579'046$]( bounty per day to miners, without counting initial investment and the cost of the farmers (in this case 3), we have a ratio per day of 2579046/610000=4.22!

There are a fundamental fault in this discussion that I will try to fix soon, here a little explanation:
How can people know if the ratio money/goods go up? Inflation isn't automatic.
Money sometimes, when them work, create whealt, new money are always created as a debt, so, some else investment, and this doesn't automatically create inflation, if the enterpreneus who borrow it succed! They doesn't do it also if he fails because the money are assured with his home or other goods...
Inflation/deflation is about flux: money circulation speed/industrial prodution maximal speed.

Yes, I understand, It's only an experiment, at least anyone can improve it, if they add (generally considered) useful modifications. For me this is the point of all.
Anyway the problem of creating a rule that is fair to all is really really difficult.
Because every rules benefits someone more than someone else! It's impossible the opposite! Anyone have it's sport, I'm good at swimming not at riding. So to choose rules of a game for all is near impossible, somebody is always in advantage. (In this case Chinese people!?) This is a greater problem, and doesn't simply apply to the law to assign the start coins.

Yes but in 2 blocks if I use the maximum error in the future, let's assume 2.30h I can take the network in the future of 5h!! :D
I know this is reveries without sense, the important thing is the sequence, not the time...
But in the case of the previous example I can block all the subsequent time-honest peer for near 3h, just controlling the network for 2 block (around 20 minutes), right?


So, IRL, if I own a node of 10% of total hashpower I have 1 possibility in 100 (0.1*0.1: probability to catch two node in a row) to block the network for 3 hours, and because in a day is processed around 150 blocks is not so difficult to do this one time a day: with this method I will spread the fear around the Bitcoin community just after having sold with an ultra leverage all my 100 btc, in this way I will conquest a large amount of shittyfiat and will obtain the nickname of Doctor TimeDoom, right?

This is not so fair: "comments closed"!!!
So after all this discussion about decentralization and democracy, and a lot of time taken to read I can't even say what I think?! That's a crazy attitude!
"This projects an image of a frightening endgame for Bitcoin: the Bitcoin network spending millions of dollars of electricity every year only to replace the US dollar’s mining algorithm of “8 white guys” with a few dozen guys in Shenzhen."
For me all the article can be summed up in that sentence, and here it's clear that Vitalik doesn't know the Pareto law: this is a problem that applies to everything!!
A more profound problem that can't simply be solved by technology, you need a complex idea to solve that!!!
I can anyway say that probably in the future also the creation of hardware will be decentralize and a lot more simple! So the real solution to me is create a more simple way to build (or maybe print!) computer hardware: in this way only the architecture of the hardware count: anyway it's normal this problem now, it's the first time that we can mine digital gold trough mining, and we will see after ASICS for sure a lot of innovation in this field, maybe also a way to decentralize the construction, like I just say...

Yes but the question remain, how much cost a bitcoin to mine?
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:18:29
We don’t need all this hassle. If we go to a store, we can simply get a share double sig wallet with the store. Then when we want to pay sign the transaction for that wallet, an obviously the store will add its signature. Then there isn't possibility to double spend, because if we try to sign another transaction to an address that doesn’t belong to the store, the store will not sign the transaction. Then, obviously, if for certain reason we want to withdrawal the funds from share wallet, we need to wait 6 confirmation from last transaction.
Obviously this can be done also with a wallet, for example if we use greenaddress and process to the store wallet, if we got a greenaddress double sig wallet and the store trust greenaddress, then he can also doesn't wait for confirmation. Very likely in the future we will have a network of trusted wallet that trust each other, and so we can avoid to wait.

For me this can be fixed with a good blog from you that talk more deeply and like in the subreddit "explainlikeimfive".
The discussion on cancer have to be public and it would be wonderful that also researcher in that field take part to that.
I really will read it and also donate to posts, I think I'm not the only out there.

No, so it's too simple, I can simply change the time on my pc to get the block accepted also if after 2 hours (I know it's near impossible), the wiki talks about "network-adjusted" referring to the average time of node connected to the node that solve the block, right?
So if I understand can be an error in the range of (2 hours + average_block_confirmation_time*5.5) right? Because the average confirmation time of the past 11 blocks is the confirmation time of a block *5.5 in the past from the "actual moment" right?

5:40 **The foundation vision is to integrate bitcoin with banks not to replace banks with bitcoin?**
But why we need banks? They are only a serve when it come to store and send our money. The other things that they do is loan our money at giant rate and doesn't give nothing to us, instead crisis sometimes...
What we need is decentralized p2p lending, we need the bank only as a versifier of the collateral to assure the loan.
If we can achieve that, for first time we have global competition between all the people that have money in lending rate! And so the rate will be around 0.5%/year at max at the end of the process...
Banks are only our idea of money management before technology, now they are only a problem, too big, too dark, too powerful, it's the last treath to democracy, after intelligence services.
She is good but need to specify what she means with "bank" and why we need them! For me at this time banks are only security in cryptography, so open-standards and the dismission of NIST and NSA for a global p2p process of creating cryptostandards!

Mhm, I don't know about this, I have to further investigate about what you are saying now about PoS, I will do that, currently I'm on an idea that, if not solve the problem, distribute wealth without keep out from nobody! I know this seems near impossible, the trick is that this **create** wealth, because we always do this, money serves to speed up this process, but isn't dynamical, just exchangeable numbers! I will for sure send to you the idea when I translate it (or do you know italian? :D)
Anyway, here a news that I hope will make you (more) happy:  (First Italian, in Roma, Ethereum Meetup!) for sure there I will know more about that and maybe have some idea on this for tomorrow :)

This is very interesting instead:


will take legal steps to prevent its growth and possible dominance. In this regard it 
should be kept in mind that the U.S. Constitution “…has nothing to say about private 
parties creating money,” to quote a legal expert (Grinberg, Hastings Science and 
Technology Law Journal, 2011). Thus Articles 8 and 10 of Part I specify that “Congress 
has the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the 
Standard of Weights and measures” while “No state shall … make any thing but gold 
and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.” So in fact the Constitution’s provisions 
regarding money evidently specify a gold or silver or bimetallic standard and therefore
would appear to be sharply inconsistent with the Federal Reserve’s monetary powers as 
presently recognized. How did this come to pass? The answer is, as many of you will 
know, that the current situation was enabled as a result of three Supreme Court 
decisions concerning the Greenbacks from the Civil War, decisions the reasoning of 
which seems to be highly illogical, as described in detail by Richard Timberlake in a 
recent (2013) book (and very briefly in a short paper of mine).

Why do you think that building hardware have to be centralized forever? I mean, hardware is the result of information and a big start investment to build the "hardware printing structure".

I just find on Jstor and with my student priveledge downloaded the [original paper]( to which he refer in the lecture.
Anyway I just readed the lecture, not so excited also if I find out that he compare his work to the one of Hayek:
*Subsequent to that time, after consulting with some of the economics
faculty at Princeton, I learned of the work and publications of Friedrich von Hayek. I must
say that my thinking is apparently quite parallel to his thinking in relation to money and
particularly with regard to the non-typical viewpoint in relation to the functions of the
authorities which in recent times have been the sources of currencies (earlier “coinage”).)*
In fact it's very similar, I note it while reading, here I post something about Hayek, some choosen parts from [The denationalization of Money](
I also learned that Newton run the Royal Mint for a while, got a very shrewd people in prison and then hang him, and he catch some counterfeiters!! He also be the first, according to Nash, to invent gold standard, linking currency to gold!
*the pound was the original currency of “the gold
standard”, with its value pegged to gold in 1717 by Isaac Newton who was then Master
of the Mint.*

Ethereum is just a distributed computer with only specific capabilities (Like a console is for a computer, as an example :D).
You have to see in the way of complete distributed computer that can implement any sort of programs in a distributed manner. Then, to have the trust that a program will execute the program overtime it's another feature of the program.

At a first glance seems good:
**Stockman plans to introduce the “Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act”**
*Apr 8, 2014 Press Release*
WASHINGTON - Today Congressman Steve Stockman (R-TX) will introduce the “Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act.” If enacted, this legislation would change the tax status of virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, from property to currency.
Congressman Stockman introduced this legislation as the IRS begins to regulate virtual currencies as property and require capital gains tax payments on any virtual currency transactions. This legislation would instead require Americans to pay sales taxes on virtual currency transactions, a more proper way of taxing such transactions.  
Commenting on this proposed legislation, Congressman Stockman said, “This is a nascent industry. Along with 3-D printers and nanotubes, cryptocurrency is the future. We need to encourage it, not discourage it. There is risk associated with every budding industry in America.”
This evening, Congressman Stockman will visit the New York City Bitcoin Center to further discuss this legislation.

Yes that's the "correct" world, but that meaningless if you think it's perfect, because it's a dimensionless number we can at least be sure that the "value" of that number doesn't change because the dimention's value change; for example if that are fpd (folding per day) then we can have that the folding value change because, a new idea on folding is invented, folding isn't usefull anymore because we fold in another way now, or maybe we can have that we complete all the folding possibilities (Probably this isn't possible but is to give the idea :D).

**Bitcoin “ATMs” are not ATMs at all.**
Bitcoin kiosks are machines, connected to the
Internet, that allow you to insert cash in exchange
for Bitcoins (which they can give you as a slip of
paper or by moving money to your public key on
the blockchain). They may look like traditional ATMs,
but unlike ATMs that you may associate with your
checking and savings accounts, Bitcoin kiosks do
not connect to your bank and may lack many of the
safeguards you would expect. They may also
charge high transaction fees – media reports describe
transaction fees as high as 7% and exchange rates
$50 over rates you could get elsewhere.
In the future bankers, when all of them will lose their job, will become the better clown ever existed! :D

EDIT: Anyway I don't want to be defeatist, I donated more times to research on cancer and I don't have anything against this team, they seems pretty good and I will also fund them a little, I'm simple giving my personal view about the inability of science to fight in fields like this. Because science after all also have to respond to the rule "maximize profit", no exception for scientists.

Can anybody explain to me why can't be any coin colored but only the one previously colored to become XRP?
And another question, did I get it right that Coloredcoins doesn't require to speculate on the "paper for contracts" but it's speculation free?
PS I know that on bitcoin speculation is needed to build the market depth, but for the XRP it's completely different, all coins on there is based on trust and secured from the same people securing bitcoin blockchain, independently.

You don't get it, it seems, the problem is that I'm not a native speaker.
Let's assume that the transaction are indexed by txid, now they are stored in the blockchain by time and so to be fast because you don't need where to find, at what time to search, you have to put it in ram. But, if you store them alfabetically by txid, then you got exponentially to the storage location also in HDD because for example I have txid 4d62748ea8cfb13fad014658494a20cc39df10419c79f64b860bcee90bfbfaf2 and I begin to search, first half or second, then again in the half chosen, for every digit, so it take the time of time_to_see_the_half^times_of_checking_the_half ...do you get it? Why this isn't possible?
you get the times_of_checking_the_half from this formula UTXO/average_tx^times_of_checking_the_half if we assume UTXO=Blockchain size, (but it's less) we got at max 25 times of checking  with 20000000000=blockchain size and 400 average transaction size.....now I need to know the time of operation in ram and HDD....but in general to learn electronics :D
Anyway it's to explain the idea and from a negation of it (999/1000 :D) better understanding.

**Lake Tahoe Property Sells for $1.6 Million in Bitcoins**
*Transaction Is Just One of a Handful to Use the Virtual Currency*
 




A site in Truckee, Calif., was recently bought with $1.6 million in bitcoins. The buyer plans to build a home. Martis Camp
A Lake Tahoe property sold Thursday for $1.6 million—in bitcoins.
The property is one of just a handful of residential real estate transactions in months that have used virtual currency—and potentially a record in terms of price. The price in bitcoins was 2,739.
The 1.4-acre acre home site has views of the Pacific Crest, a surrounding mountain range. It is located in Martis Camp, a private luxury recreational resort in Truckee, Calif. The 2,177-acre resort, near Lake Tahoe's north shore, has a Tom Fazio golf course, a 44-seat movie theater and an "aerial adventure park" with rope courses and a zip line.
Brian Hull, Martis Camp's director of sales, said the buyer was a "Silicon Valley entrepreneur," but declined to disclose his name. He said the buyer purchased the land through a trust, and plans to build a home on the site.
The idea to pay for the Tahoe property with bitcoins came from the buyer, said Mr. Hull. "When we originally heard the idea of bitcoin, everybody had a little pause," he said. "We weren't educated at how the transaction would go."
The digital currency was introduced in 2009 and isn't backed by a central bank or government. It can be created by a computer process known as "mining" and traded online through unregulated Internet exchanges. The value of bitcoins, which began at just pennies, has fluctuated over the past few years. The price of a bitcoin topped $1,100 in late 2013, but is now around $590 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index and can shift significantly throughout the day.
BitPay, an online-merchant processor that operates similarly to PayPal or Worldpay, handled the Tahoe transaction. Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's vice president of marketing, said about 85% of the site's merchants are online retailers. Teslas and Lamborghinis have also been purchased with bitcoins through the site.
To transfer property using bitcoins on BitPay, the seller creates an invoice for the price of the property, either in bitcoin or U.S. dollars, as BitPay can pay out in either currency. The bitcoin exchange rate is guaranteed for 15 minutes after the invoice is created, during which the purchaser must complete payment. If the payment isn't completed within the allotted time, the exchange rate is recalculated.
In March, an anonymous buyer paid 800 bitcoins, or more than $500,000, for a two-bedroom luxury villa in Bali. In May, a home in suburban Kansas City sold for about $500,000 in bitcoins through BitPay. BitPay says the Lake Tahoe home site is the most expensive property transaction they've handled far, though not their largest purchase in general.
Several sellers have tried listing their properties in bitcoins, including a Las Vegas real-estate developer who asked $7.85 million for his 25,000-square-foot home. He has since taken the property off the market, according to his listing agent. BitPremier, a website that sells luxury items in exchange for bitcoins has listings for homes, including one in Naples, Fla., for $969,000 (1,643.373 bitcoins) and a 9,845-square-foot house in the Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, Calif., for $7.45 million (12,627.119 bitcoins).
"As far as I know, this would definitely be a record breaker" for a publicly disclosed property sale using bitcoins, said Alan Silbert, CEO of BitPremier, which wasn't involved in this deal. The previous record was likely the villa in Bali.
Mr. Hull, of Martis Camp, said the company is now open to using bitcoin for future sales. "We're in the business of dealing with predominantly the Bay Area," he said. "A lot of our buyer base is in the tech sector, and there are a lot of people who have bitcoin holdings."

Thanks a lot!
Can you explain me better this: 
"Whenever a node connects to another node, it gets a UTC timestamp from it, and stores its offset from node-local UTC. The network-adjusted time is then the node-local UTC plus the median offset from all connected nodes. Network time is never adjusted more than 70 minutes from local system time, however." So the basis time is the one of the node that solve the block but adjusted if I understand in what way? (Because obviously the node can have a completely wrong time)
From this: "A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "Network-adjusted time" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you."
I understand this I think, also if I have maybe other question on this.

Mitico, ti volevo proprio segnalare un progetto riguardo alla tua domanda su come si fa a creare un sistema di voto basato su blockchain, per il problema delle identità, che hai fatto 5 giorni fa a montecitorio.
Il progetto [BitGov]( è stato ideato da chi ha uplodato il video ed è portato avanti da pochi altri studenti della singularity university, dove è nato.
Comunque il problema c'è sempre quando bisogna trasportare informazioni fuori dalla blockchain alla blockchain.
In ogni caso con la tecnologia di oggi, è sbagliato votare, perchè, primo, si può attuare la panarchia, secondo anche non attuandola è possibile decidere ogni singolo meccanismo della gestione dei beni comuni, per cui non c'è comunque bisogno di nessun intermediario secondo me. :)
EDIT: Sto leggendo questo:  dunque ho appena scoperto che ti occupi direttamente di questi sistemi, quindi probabilmente già lo conoscevi, altrimenti ti spedisco senz'altro il contatto perchè sicuramente è una persona cui interessano molto questi sistemi (l'ultima volta che l'ho visto stava cercando di realizzare quel sistema e cercava fondi).

Yes seems very similar that part between Szabo and Nash...but I need more time to read Nash problem before see this.
Anyway, just for kidding I find out that Szabo says:
*“In my limited experience creating Internet pseudonyms, I’ve been quite
distracted by the continual need to avoid leaving pointers to my
True Name lying around — excess mail to/from my True Name, shared
files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable
logins, etc. The penet.fi site explicitly maintains a list of pointers
to the original address. All kinds of security controls — crypto, access,
information, inference — have to be continually on my mind when using
pseudonymous accounts. The hazards are everywhere. With our current
tools it’s practically impossible to maintain an active pseudonym for a
long period of time against a sufficiently determined opponent, and
quite a hassle to maintain even a modicum of decent security. Pointers
to info and/or tools to enable the establishment and maintenance of a
net.nym, beyond the standard cypherpunks PGP/remailer fare with which
I’m now familiar, greatly appreciated. Especially nice would be a list
of commercial net providers that allow pseudonymous accounts.”*
So the likehood of Szabo being Wei go up!!
Because you are unfamiliar with Bitcoin capabilities and thanks to you I'm going to read interesting thinks about money tonight I want to sen you a dollar with this little magic spell:
1 USD
Anyway keep in touch, I'm just studying about problem like that.

You simply need a oneaddress.io supporting BIP 32.
Regarding the problem of 2 payments in the same time, I never think about that but doesn't seems a real problem. You can always check people address when they pay, and act consequently.
Anyway you are right about anonymity, but I think that for general purpose services like McDonalds, it can have a public address, then will be the people that have to take different and private address if they want. Anyway we need more reliable system to have anonymity, this is for sure! :)

Mail answer of core dev:
SQRL is general purpose, BitID exists only in the Bitcoin realm. Technicaly they are based on exactly same principles.
The difference is that with SQRL you need to download/use a third party app just for that, with BitID it requires only to have a Bitcoin wallet. So with SQRL adoption is not easy, with BitID it is instant (as soon as a wallet integrates BitID it becomes accessible to its users)

Oh, ok, so now two possible outcomes:
-Perry Metzger says the truth: Szabo is a real person (but anyway nobody never see him - excluded Metzger in the 90's - and nobody have a photo a video a record of him at an event etc.)
-Perry Metzger says the truth: Szabo is Perry Metzger, or a group that include Perry Metzger, or maybe he want simply to cover the fact that Szabo is a pseudonym.
This second option is also consonant to this kind of behavior:

I'm not an informatic, but just reasoning 2 sec I imagine this.
If instead of searching all the blockchain the UTXO are ordered not by time (like now) but by address, it will be a lot faster to find them and so maybe it van be stored on an HDD.
But I want more precisely detils on the difference and how that works, that "it would be orders of magnitude slower than reading from memory" it's a thing that I just imagine and that I have just read [here](

The fact this post doesn't get any upvote means this sub is completely finished!!
I copy paste my comment on the article:
The superficiality is embarrassment! 
1 - Cost to obtain 100 dollars is 100 dollars of work for some and near 0 for other, the central banker or so: for gold it's fixed by nature, and it's a proof of work, or watts used to extract and move it! So it's a proof of a work.
2 - You can't use cryptography to demonstrate that you own gold, because you have in any case to trust the owner of the strongbox, and also the people that accept your "certificate of gold owning", in this sense it's similar to fiat currency, in the sense that it's function also of trust, but not only if you show it, see point 1. 
With BTC this is completely different, you can proof that you own an address in a very simple way, just sign a message with you private key, or simply send 10 cent to the people that want the proof of ownership. For BTC the reasoning is equal, but here you really use watts, initial investment and maintenance. If you do the math you find that a BTC could rise in value of extraction a lot faster than gold, it all depends by difficulty increase speed.

Occam razor: bitcoinwisdom bug?
@_date: 2014-09-07 21:27:47
Yes, this is a gaffe, I'm thinking better on this, and it's very difficult to do, because a people can double spend, in every moment until the confirmation, so I can't simply wait few seconds to get the unconfirmet transaction in all the nodes. Because then a second transaction can be accepted from some nodes that aren't honest and maybe they are faster to mine it! Anyway probably implementing a way to accept only first first unconfirmed transaction will help to stop the spreading of double spends...maybe...
Anyway, any hint on the first question?

**Stockman plans to introduce the “Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act”**
*Apr 8, 2014 Press Release*
WASHINGTON - Today Congressman Steve Stockman (R-TX) will introduce the “Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act.” If enacted, this legislation would change the tax status of virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, from property to currency.
Congressman Stockman introduced this legislation as the IRS begins to regulate virtual currencies as property and require capital gains tax payments on any virtual currency transactions. This legislation would instead require Americans to pay sales taxes on virtual currency transactions, a more proper way of taxing such transactions.  
Commenting on this proposed legislation, Congressman Stockman said, “This is a nascent industry. Along with 3-D printers and nanotubes, cryptocurrency is the future. We need to encourage it, not discourage it. There is risk associated with every budding industry in America.”
This evening, Congressman Stockman will visit the New York City Bitcoin Center to further discuss this legislation.

thanks for your work, I think you don't have to try to make clear what's already obvious, I know politicians will continue to try to get the reddit approval to impose something strictly political, this is infact what every politicians do by nature. The point here is that if this behaviour can be excusable - maybe - some times - to use dialectic to force things or change people mind - I think you do not have to arguing with these people, also if they do this without realizing it.
Bitcoin isn't a political party, it's a software, and have to be based on logic and research, not on dialectics and politics, if this will happen, like now, that a single fundamental feature can be influenced by simple dialectic then Bitcoin have already lost.

And I'm sure you don't even know the name of the file where the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter is set.  Look at the name of the file, it isn't a normal file, it isn't a normal change, you have to make a difference between changing the basic parameters that define something, and changing the technical aspects like processing crypto with a faster library and so on, one it's about the inner structure, the other it's about the execution of that inner structure. 
Anyway that parameter can be changed, but for sure not with an hard fork, that's the most supid thing to do, since it will set the way - and it is itself the way - to allowing a code commit using the miners and not github, in others way allow politics to rule bitcoin and not bitcoin to rule politics.
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:26:07
This is true, but the podcast was very interesting anyway, the problem it's old and it's to prove identity in digital world, satoshi thinks to have a digital proof of stake via mining, d`Angelo says this would be true only if the mining chip building process wouldn't be centralized, this is true. But for me the problem here it's about slavery in China and before bitcoin economy, after all bitcoin born on this, but to change it. Maybe we will eventually realize - we already do- centralize production of the center of the world, that is cpu, isn't very intelligent, Chinese hardware Trojan already prove this, but it's a big process and will take time.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:27:17
A good currency attire a lot of people, but if you allow a lot of people to change a currency it will be horrible soon. That's the point here, you have to make a difference between "valuable" on quality and on quantity of people using it, the first one take the second. The second one doesn't imply the first and if there isn't quality it will fail given some time.

Do you understand this is possible just because there is no real use of Bitcoin now? Do you rally think that if a people are going to value a bitcoin transaction  0.1 bitcoin and another just 0.0001 we have to impose all two transactions? Remember in one year working on the blocksize, if you simply want to allow all transactions on first block available you need to have 1GB block. Or if you still have some judgment you have to build a layer 2. Like in the banking system and in all real ecosystems.

“One of the great things about Bitcoin is its lack of democracy”: don't you really get how much is wonderful than when you don't like a software - on the opposite of a country - you can simply change - leave - it? Tell the truth to yourself, you wouldn't vote to try to save your country if you can move away, or at least, don't forget software it's always a private project from some people, like a crow sourced book -not air, or sun, that's a public good - you can't change the ending voting, and you don't dream do this in harry potter (the most popular book among bigger-blockers), better if you think this is the end go away from this sub and sell your bitcoin to me.

Work in progress also here:
 – BitTorrent + Bitcoin file transfers. Let’s implement a proof of concept inside FrostWire that allows anybody to sell content online without centralized entities. Let’s enable book authors, musicians, film makers and photographers to publish content on the network that is downloadable for Bitcoins, the author decides to share a percentage of every sale with honest seeders willing to help distribute the content.

Forced? It's just normal you poker gambling aren't saved forever visible to everybody, this happen just because we don't have a system to get the real value to the blockchain security. It's completely temporary, when people realize how much security the blockchain offer the possibility are infinite and the demand will go to infinite, you can either go blocks to 10 GB and let the network be just a cable connection between two miners one in london and one in nyc, or you can give the right value to the transaction and create new incentive to support that security.

No per panarchia s'intende un governo non basato sullo spazio ma basato sulle reti, come se molte culture diverse vivessero nella stessa zona e si organizzassero con loro proprie leggi. Ovviamente s'intende che nessuna legge vada a collidere con quelle del vicino, ma questo in realtà è molto semplice. Comunque io non capisco assolutamente l'ultilità della democrazia, per ogni problema, se ben posto c'è solo una soluzione ottima, si tratta di trovare i problemi, e tutti hanno gli stessi.

This is not a meme, it is propaganda, and yes, propaganda it's always about conspiracy theories, the point here is that I extrapolate only a partial picture to show how it is easy to make something appear clear when it's not (what hearn try to do in his post...).

You never really understand the gravity of what you are allowing, so I know you really don't do this for evil, but anyway you are allowing democracy - let's say the best form of politics - into Bitcoin, this will be his end.
Anyway your joke doesn't make sense, because actually this is perfectly on the mind level of people who doesn't understand that moving basic parameters have huge real world implications, and that bitcoin is great because everything is planned defined and predictable, here we go into politics, where all is chaos, power wars, good speaking, ignorance and idiocracy. 
21M limit is an example: allow human intervention into a Bitcoin, it's the reality some stupid/evil people are making.

Why all people around have so much difficulty understanding this:
    Bitcoin is an antipolitical system, it's aim it's to limiting to zero human intervention in monetary issues. Any intervention will be political and will allow extreme power in the center of a network.
This is why somebody call it a commodity like gold, if we allow this kind of human interventions, then it will be just another fedcoin.
Don't try to say: we can do it democratically, because we don't have voting systems, and anyway they just allow better speaker to win, not better idea.
So this is a huge problem, but not really in itself, the problem is that people doesn't understand this simple truth and basically are pushing - thinking just to change a number in better - to give power to some people now actually have the director of the FED to change some numbers and completely give a political valence to money.

Still they do not have the money to buy all chips they produce, maybe they can do that for a month, but not more. So production is centralized but consumption cant be.
51% attack in this case would be, amassing money faster that money gained from selling gpus, and then using those money to buy gpus all in once: also if they dont pay the profit surplus - they own the company - they should do this for all amount of $ of gpu sold before the start of attack (assuming no increase in speed/$ per gpu, otherwise a bit less).
Sure they can perform an attack premining on a new line after a tick/tock, or maybe not even this would be enough.

Do the 20MB size have any logic basement or argumentation?
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:16:36
Really thanks for this perfect answer.


I think this is the not clear point here. For me the blockchain is what define a coin. If somebody modify a client and some actual rules of a coin, without doing a new blockchan for its altcoin, he is actually trying to force commits in the bitcoin core, without use the normal procedure: BIP, wait for approval of other devs. For this reason this is of a fundamental importance.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:09:25
Yes, exactly, now I clarify it a bit better. Here it's clarified: 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:18:16
I'm not a good english speaker, I simply mean people who want to fork with 'forkers', nothing more or less.
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:58:25
First point, yes it will be a serious decision if you have more than one chiice, it have to be ready XT2 XT3 XT4 etc, then people will be able to choose what they want, but I'm sure they will act in function of others, so they are not free, at least with my definition, act in function of what do you think.
Second one, I remember, miners never determine any rules, they just obey the core client rules and were never able to change them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:01:53
The point is all on this, you are forking the software without forking the blockchain, and this is why everybody - I mean non-forkers - are upset about this behavior.
And in the process of doing this, you are really changing the bitcoin deep rules, using miners to justify this idiotic behaviours you are giving them a voice, that they haven't to have. 
About the 8MB, I have no problem with it, and I think at some point with consensus it will be necessary.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:39:20
Can you give more details about it? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:28:14
Do anybody test this for Bitcoin (on the blocksize issue)? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:33:57
I want to know the official question of XT to this question:
    Why they don't do a completely different coin? With a blockchain a protocol and a client?
There are a lot of ways to take their bitcoin from the actual blockchain to the new one, for example a proof of burn. I mean, in this way the actual bitcoin will gain, and they will be more free. No split, no terrible debates. The miners that like that project will go there the others will remain here. All just with a technical trick of moving the coins. Like in the good old times :D
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:12:22


This is unbelievable!!! So now that he know how to do it, why simply doesn't do it?

@_date: 2015-08-16 15:47:30
Ahaha no, you are forcing a change in the blockchain rules using the client, you are not exiting, exiting means having a new client and a new blockchain like every normal altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:44:41
One of the best answers until now.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:24:25


Now I clarify it in the original question, I mean why it isn't a fork on github.
Regarding the other questions: "More voting would be nice." The problem is this, who decide that voting is the right tool to solve problems, who can vote who cannot? Do you get that this completely change the central point of bitcoin, that is, no human involved outside of developing?
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:48:45
So do you really think average network bandwidth of miners will double every two years? And if you think this will not happen in any way what do you see as the price for this?
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:09:42
So why this post get 166 pt and 144 comments?
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:31:23
I mean force if the core devs want to avoid a fork.
Anyway is not forcing, but trying to go around normal way of submitting commits, here you completely change bitcoin and ask for miners approval, normally are devs that decide. And for me the most terrible things is not the 8 MB - I'm also pro 8MB - but that miners have for first time political interference into bitcoin developing.
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:08:14
Sees you can't link more words together, read this "fork on github", not "fork".
If people vote merit probably we never see nobody of the actual politician, anyway, that it's your POV, I will like that's true.

@_date: 2015-08-16 20:41:53
I'm sure they are thinking about this from a long time and they know it's really risky to change a fundamental variable, also with full consensus, because the centralization cost is too high.

@_date: 2015-08-12 10:48:48


To judge an argument from who have it it's the ultimate idiocracy. It's the same that judge a person from it dresses.
On the contrary is an idea, good or bad, that have to be useful to eventually judge - if this is useull at all - a person, not the contrary.
And getting a bigger block in this way is not only dangeruous for the consequences of the block, bot for how bitcoin can be changed from few people, and upon all, because if allow democracy, and human "wise voting system" to interfere with a system designed to have no human intervention, so basically destroy bitcoin at its core.
To have eventually a change in the block size it's an extremely dangerous and delicate process that cannot be achieved trough argumentation and shouting with blog post, but after a long consensus process among developers.

If the 75% for bitcoin-tx is reached then all the actual developers are supposed to start developing on the new one? From that point are the miners supposed to vote on further increase? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:19:29


You think this, it's good, but you have to realize that the Bitcoin that you get isn't this, it's some developers experiment you can join, or create a fork, another coin with different blockchain, protocol and client, but to change a fact agains what is Bitcoin, see above, you have to do a sort of violent revolution, actually if you win you are destroying what you want to improve.
It will otherwise completely correct to do what do you want with all the miners that want this on another Blockchain, on another coin. You can then move your coins to that blockchain in several ways if this is the problem. With sidechain soon, with an organized proof of burn if you specify this in the protocol.

This is absolutely not true at the point that also Hearn excuses for this:

Little fact, internet speed doesn't depends on you, like energy cost, what you can do it's just create a good asic and mine. For this reason there will be a geographical and numerical centralization.
If you see china average network speed increase last year it's less than [12%]( and blocks are determined to double every 2 years, so it have to be at least 40% a year, this is completely out of mind and will lead to complete centralization in a few years.

If you are referring to devs I think this isn't true, when you eventually buy bitcoin, you know that Bitcoin is a program with certain rules, and you doesn't expect that miners are implied in decision about its changes, you know that to modify it you have to push a commit or do a BIP for important ones, and wait other devs approval.

About this you are completely getting wrong, you are not deciding anything, you are just used as an excuse, just two people are deciding here, Mike and Gavin, deal with it.


On that time miners are not supposed to vote for anything, remember? They are used as a blind forces, in a perfect game theory design to ensure the security of old blocks on the blockchain, just this, and only this.


This is what scares me, this absolutely superficial view of Bitcoin, do you actually know that Adam Back, one of the founder of that company that is working to actually improve Bitcoin - not simply change variables - invent the proof of work - one of the cornerstones of Bitcoin - and actually create the most similar version of it in the past, called hashcash? Can I ask you how in the universe do you think Blockstream is doing bad for Bitcoin?




This is interesting, but you get simply that in this case "owners" doesn't means they can do a change outside of the actual rule for doing a change, that is, passing for other core devs approval.

1 - "It's not a fork on github" - [Mike Hearn]( 
2 - You can't just take words from the randomwordpickingmachine, in a meritocracy somebody have to decide the merit of the people, here nobody can, maybe satoshi, but the point in all is this, what the majority feel as right can be wrong on the long term. So the merit is determined with time, nobody can decide it in advance.

Who decide that the majority it's to count in just miners? Do you think that that's the only way of invest in bitcoin? That is just the only provable. There are a lot of people that are investing in a Bitcoin where - for example - miners have no voice but only devs, and actually see this as a putsch. That people invest in Bitcoin because they know the devs and trust them and the actual code, but personally I absolutely do not trust miners and doesn't want them implied in any Bitcoin decision, also not important ones, and this is important.

I'm absolutely with you on this and personally in favour of a 8 MB block. But I'm just really upset that everybody now found perfectly normal all of these deep changes for just a number that can/will eventually be changed also on the core when they also will need time. I'm sure they are able to change a number after all. And doesn't want the network to be unable to process transaction, but I think they are taking the problem a lot more seriously and thinking it from its basement.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:35:10
Same, but I think that the way 8mb temporary patch is added id deeply wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:40:00




If you do the calculations you get that all transactions on the blockchain until now can happen on visa in less than an hour on a typical day. And visa isn't for microstransaction, and doesn't aspire to serve the web - it actually born after it. So in this light do you think that the relevance of 8x increase is in any way comparable to the importance of a switch to a completely new code with no testing, a deep change in bitcoin without even post a BIP, and the fact that now miners are involved in bitcoin change with devs in a sort of ad-hoc democracy with no clear bounds on what it can apply, if only on this variable or also other ones?

The point is you will change your mind sooner or later, when this fake system will finally go away with a rumble, the point is that to keep up the pressure from this event Bitcoin have to be a good technology in speed and decentralization, now is giving up on centralization - it seems - for no real speed improvement (we need an order of 10000x-100000x and little minds are thinking about 2x-10x). Just think about Bitcoin from a bigger perspective, it is really something different on the timespan of 10-20 years or just 1-2 years, to get it right you have to look at the long timespan, so, actually you are not an user but you are a scientist, trying a technology, you are a beta tester, and your vision of it is needed to the improvement, don't just be so passive and don't look at just 2-3 months from now...:D

And second, that the ZKP system, while fast enough to be practical, is still not very fast. For example, in our demo the ZKP system proves 5 executions of SHA256 and the Sudoku constraints, and takes about 20 seconds to execute on a laptop. (The verification of the proof takes only a few milliseconds.)
How much it will take without omomorphic encryption? How much time less?

First big move will be a system to real time accounting for big data exchange.
First simple example: Now you can have a very limited API access to twitter data, or total access for 4000$/month, this will make possible all the intermediate forms, in real time. And it will be possible to create an entire economy ecosystem out of this, speculating on the demand, for example, and pay more to have more brand witch or faster access, or probably there will be many companies that will download data for some regions and then resell them faster and so on. 
Anyway first we need a really scalable ecosystem - I'm not talking about 10x or even 100x like the "block increase idiots" - I'm talking about real time offchain transaction with no fee, compensation chamber, a real ecosystem that use Bitcoin ledger as its center.

 Yes, the debate is crucial for the future of Bitcoin. The outcome could determine what Bitcoin is used for in the future, and even whether it continues to be scalable as a currency. We should be careful not to make a hasty, ill-informed decision that seems to solve our problems today but instead sets us up for long-term failure. Unfortunately, there are very few people in the world qualified to make these decisions.

**Bitcoin will become the world’s single currency, tech chief says**
Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade, Jack Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley’s leading entrepreneurs, has said.
Despite recent weakness in the value of bitcoin and concerns that it cannot currently process transactions fast or cheaply enough to act as a currency, Mr Dorsey, who is chief executive of both Twitter and the payments company Square, believes that bitcoin will overcome these obstacles and will be used to buy everyday items such as coffee.
Bitcoin is the world’s most popular digital currency and the best-known application of blockchain technology. It exists only as strings of computer code in an immutable, distributed digital public ledger. Created nine years ago, it came to prominence last year as its value rocketed to $20,000, turning some of its early adopters into billionaires in months. Its popularity led to an explosion of rival cryptocurrencies.
In November, Square said it would enable users in America to buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app. Bitcoin’s value has dropped sharply since then amid fears of a regulatory clampdown and warnings of a bubble. Yesterday it was trading at $8,803.
Mr Dorsey insisted that virtual currencies built using distributed ledgers would be the next big breakthrough decentralising technology. “The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” he told The Times. This would happen “probably over ten years, but it could go faster”.
As bitcoin became more widely used, it was up to payment processing companies such as Square to make sure it was widely accepted, he added.
Mr Dorsey is a bitcoin investor himself and this week was revealed as a funder of a start-up called Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. His comments highlight a debate among bitcoin enthusiasts about how best to transform it from a store of value into a means of quick and easy payments. Mr Dorsey accepted that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency”.
“It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,” he said.
The entrepreneur is in London this week to promote Square and declined to answer questions about Twitter. He co-founded Square as a mobile payments company in the US in 2009 and brought it to the UK last year. It is known for its small white credit and debit card readers that plug into smartphones and tablets. It offers next-day settlements to merchants in competition with the legacy card payment firms such as WorldPay and Barclaycard and rival start-ups such as iZettle.
Square is launching an instant deposit service. Merchants can use it to get funds into their bank accounts about 20 minutes after a transaction.
Mr Dorsey said that cashflow was a huge issue for small businesses and the ability to get paid instantly was crucial in enabling many of them to restock.

I read it from this  I still doesn't read it but from first view I think "If china and russia are betting on gold for next great cycle US will bet on bitcoin." This is really the opposite of a lot of comments, in fact just a random think, but the book catch my attention.
First view=reading this:


which explains why gold is making a remarkable comeback and
why a flight to hard assets including farm land and old masters
has started. Every year, more and more physical gold is moving
from vaults in the West to the East as a symbol of a change in
the world power balance.
The US wants its dollar system to prevail for as long as possible.
It therefore has every vested interest in preventing a ‘rush out
of dollars towards gold’. By selling (paper) gold, bankers have
been trying in the last few decades to keep the price of gold
under control. This war on gold has been going on for almost one
hundred years,167 but as I will explain in the following chapters,
it gained traction in the 1960s with the forming of the London
Gold Pool. Just like the London Gold Pool failed in 1969, the
current manipulation scheme of gold (and silver prices) cannot
be maintained for much longer. After a decoupling of paper and
physical gold prices in the next few years we will see the gold
price rise to its ‘full potential’.

The interesting thing is when there is a diffused risk commodities proof of energy burn like bitcoin or gold growth, this is for sure, because trust links blow up, so only proofs of past expenses are recognized, then, between bitcoin and gold, it's pretty the same but bitcoin is also contemporary a lot more portable, and portable via internet, this is the central point.

And the causes are really different in Switzerland vs usa and rest of the world.
You really doesn't get that hoarding in real time economy means less money for who can't? Less money means that to get the same amount of money/month everything have to be faster, to have the same earning flux, so this means people have to work faster, or otherwise more, or otherwise for less, and this is what's it's happening now.
Then if they aren't able to faster/work more/and for less, somebody fail, and this reinforce the process of flight to cash/stock exchange etc, out of real economy in other words.
This is a legitimate - from a horrendous system, I know this - but a legitimate desperate try to revitalize economy. And you idiots doesn't even get it...(Do you really think swiss banks gain to refuse cash?! Swiss economy have already more that 60% cash volume in 1000chf pieces.

Simple solution:
Create a "virtual saloon" where you have to pay X to enter, X have to be choose in a way you can't have a positive ROI on it. (I assume this is possible)
Then with a public algorithm, in the code, a public seed it's used to initialize it - for example next block hash - and according to the algo the players are assigned to their table.

That's quite obvious to me also: you have to maximize a function (actually it count only mining hardware and electricity cost and it's already not so distributed as it should be in the original vision), the more constrains the little the solution space, if you request low cost electricity, hardware AND fast connection you end up only with Europe and USA, and in a few days all will be in the hands of USA...

You are smart my dear. Think about this, that bitcoin mining will be the unit of measures for other kind of mining, the one you are pointing for, try to imagine a world where you can automatically pay for some kind of mining, let's say machine learning with bitcoin, you actually get a giant internet wide parallelization of the calculus. 21 inc will be the first ready to do this, and the one that will bring this to the masses.
PS Actually there they are buying with an old protocol an human brain miner in machine learning, with 21 protocol now, that will be instantaneous, and worldwide. Obviously only for "commodities works", works that can be scientifically described, as a calculus for example, but then maybe also more complex things.

For sure not killer app, but it's a good point, my answer to that is that nobody cares about the real protest, that obviously have to be about how money works. They don't understand neither how fiat nor bitcoin are working, so they will never protest this way, also bitcoin is an alternative, but not a very human money, just a rational one, even if in its own way.

Tax on Civil Law Transactions (PCC)
The contract for the sale and conversion of cryptocurrencies, which is a property right, is subject to the tax on civil law transactions (PCC) [16]. In the case of a sales contract, the obligation to pay this tax - in the amount of 1% of the market value of the acquired property right sold to the cryptocurrency - concerns the buyer. At the exchange agreement, the obligation to pay tax - in the amount of 1% of the market value of the property right, from which a higher tax applies - concerns jointly the parties to the transaction.
Excluded from taxation of PCC [17] is a contract for the sale or exchange of cryptocurrencies subject to VAT - in so far as it is subject to VAT, or if at least one of the parties to the transaction is exempt from VAT for doing so. 
    it's incredible, I hope the translation is wrong, this is way too stupid!

Lol, am I the only one who have two stickers? (One was broken when I got the box...)

Quick answer: it takes mining to the next level, you can mine everithing that it's in the computer not only bitcoin, but it has to be at the internet speed so I can't mine ram for example, and to mine hdd I also need trust - this will be done but in a second time - basically for now you can mine parallelizable computation, api access, ip access (proxy), and directly to one pc you can do streaming/gaming(streaming with input+computation), etc. Obviously with docker or similar tech if you enable the people to connect to your pc you can also rent it as a normal server.
Only enabling computing mining will be incredible. I imagine you can pay for computation or more interesting, pay at random somebody every X computation received, where every computation is like a ticket, exactly as bitcoin mining but for computing.
That's the basic structure if you think about it you can get more info. But please don't listen to the "it's a raspberrypi" monkeys.

I think we don't need a Princeton study and that the operation linked it's just the tip of the iceberg, it would be good to have a full list of things clearly make evident that it's no more a democracy, I link another good one:  but obviously all those things are non-legal also in the system framework, give tons of money to banks at superlow interest and watch while they bubble the stock market and profit without doing any good to the economy, it's already more interesting, the fact that banks pay zero taxes and even get state bonuses it's another interesting thing. We really need a list of non legal big things - this would be easier - and legal, but obviously oligarchy things even if "legal" (according to criminals ruling).

This is really intelligent!
It's an otc cfd, the only part remaining to solve is how to assure the other part that you will repay, but this is solved fast from this [idea]( - already implemented in some technologies like  and a challenger, i forgot its name.
The problem is that with the bitcoin volatility the risked fund have to be really big, or, let's say A is losing and have to repay, it's possible that delaying the payment for one day it can be in profit then! What will enforce closure of positions?
Rethinking about that, the nashx system enforce the closure of a transaction, but doesn't take into account time - in the coinffeine transactions happen really faster than the price possibility to change so it's like if time doesn't exist - so also this solution lack a system to enforce respect of the time in the contract...and so also the contract itself...it's strange.
Anyway seems it won't work, this is the reason for the usefulness of systems like bitshares.

(You can only argue the future of ethereum PoS based it's doomed, but this happen accordingly to the ethereum rules.)

A bad thing for a bad system (of state and/or currency) is good.
A good thing for a good thing like decentralized currencies is good.
The real question is, is really evitable on the long term the death of political currency, also called fiat currency? The answer is no.

1*-I think you dosn't understand the central fact that bitcoin introduce, let's explain it better: transparence (when needed, how in the case a third part have to manage my money: this is a new concept for actual banking system), very low operating costs.
This two things will lead to a different money landing, called crowfunding, where the depositors of the bank will compete on costs of money (interest) vs the maximum duration of the loan. 
So the only work of the bank remain: 
1) to take an assurance (for example a mortgage) by the borrower and do the "bureaucratic papers" 
2) and the minimal cost of software, and server running costs; to be honest also the first work can be doed by a software, and just now is doed prevalently by a software. 
This service is now offered by bitfinex and btcjam for example (tell me if you know other services).
(and the bank will be paid only for this simple work, instead of profit using our money by lending at rates shameful when we need it)
This is how the actual system will evolve. But i presume that this actual system will change to be more peer to peer and the loans will be made on a web of trust, and only to project that we want really to support (another great innovation respect the actual obscurity mafia system; just two example:  
2*-Bitcoin expect to be continuously in deflation, because every day new services/object will be sold (only) for bitcoin and so you see an higher amount of things/services vs the same amount of money supply. So all the bitcoin owner will expect to have a silent enrichment (instead of the actual silent impoverishment, see here for more data about this:

I suppose this will happen for giant company like mcdonald etc, and just now company like apple, facebook, microsoft begin to issue their own credit, also if not portable outside their websites!
And finally also states will issue their bonds (that you will need to buy its service) that will be used like currency (because bonds are currency, today we have to forget it because of bank's profit).

because 
1 - it's obvious than more people use a thing more low is the average income of that people
2 - So it's obvious that lower the price by x% will let growth the selling by 10*x% (at least! especially in the actual economic situation)

So, translated to bitcoin private transatcion are legal only because the state dosn't know (so it isn't really "legal" right?), but public transaction like this:
+$0.1 verify
are not legal?

Not a lot of people do that, is a sort of hack, the first person after Satoshi to embed a comment in the blockchain was Dan Kaminsky, [here]( more details (excuse me to link cnn article :D)
Differs from the notes that the article link because that notes are saved only on the blockchain.info website, and not in the blockchain

Ok, but the derivative of the difficulty will be 0.999999999999999 with that scale...You don't seem to take very seriously my hypothesis!

sha256 is developed by NSA, like the [Dual_EC_DRBG]( so maybe is there something wrong in this, but this is only my fear, I'm not an expert of cryptography, and this is the reason I want to know expert opinion. 
Only idiots talks about quantistic computer needed to solve or predict numbers when politics, secret service and an enormous power is highly involved: the apparent security can be a deception! Yes, power can do also this...

Anyway I don't think the price will drop, not even the 50% when bitcoin now measures also all the services of Baidu Jiasule, the other time it's 450% (also if in a double time): and above all it's only for fear of cyprus people, this time is for joy!
ps then the cyprus banks reopen, so cyprus fear end.

can you explain better?
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:54:18
yes so simply is an external hdd for the private key....and what i say is right, you can use it only one time, because when a people see (with the phone) the private key in the coin then he have that private key, so also if he spend also an half of the coin i will not accept it, because maybe before i will spend it the people form wich i take that coin spend it, or maybe the people before him etc etc....you got it?

because too much rubbish surge these days....
too much attention to fake news posted to cover the downside market speculation and to give it a sense....
it's normal that when a media influence the market the market want to own or manipulate that media at his own advantage, and with reddit this is too simple...
with a bit of time i'm also capable to destroy the news that going in the opposite direction of my market positions...
and upvote idiot/fake news that do my game...
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:42:58


 but this not secret at all, but i imagine that something like Sneakers (the film) is just going on inside the blockchain maybe...
[here]( some thinks about this by jeff garzik: for me this is silly things because to decode a message you need a key to decode that message, and the key can't be encrypted obviously (you can but you have however to post a key for that), so it has to be accessible and clear, so you have to post it on a normal site/server, and we are again in the actual situation.....
said this two people that exchange privately 2 keys can chat using the blockchain, but i think bitmessage is better to do that....or a lot of alternatives around there (now that i think about it, i remember that when i play halo multiplayer for windows is there a people named satoshi that speak about strange things in the ingame chat with another people which I do not remember the name....XD)
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:28:43
I don't know the rule according to which you earn bitcoin but basically is this: A kill B, A get an x reward from B, and viceversa, not very difficult, anybody can get it, now to have better knowledge I'm searching someone to play with...
Suggestion: sometimes the better way to have further information is to try, maybe not with 1 btc but you can log in with steam (you simply give access to your in-game score information) an put 0.01 btc if you don't trust them...then you have the better explanation possible!

If an economist wasn't born after 2009 does not mean that he can't talk about bitcoin, or the ideas behind it, do not forget that bitcoin is not just a unit of measurement, but also an idea that came from other ideas, such as all! (The problem is that also after bitcoin some people think economy is not about ideas and communication protocols but about ???)

You have to take the question in another way:
Consider what money is: money=fast of earning*size of sum earned, is a flux. The people who earn the money will not earn it all together, he will earn a little % of it time to time until earn a (1+%)x(money lent), he can put that money to the bank (that will immidiatly reuse the money and take it in circulation in form of another loan), or doing himself another loan, or use it, or freeze it.
Only in the case that he freeze it you argument make sense: on that case - assuming that not object measured by bitcoin will be also freezed :D - all the btc will have a greater power of buy, because a little quantity measure the same supply of goods/services/contracts.
On all the other cases simply the flux of money have to accelerate almost by % requested in the time requested to maintain all the economic machine stable.
**Anyway with global competitions it's clear that banks will become exchanges where money price will form.....lenders and borrowers will be the market for money, that is called also interest: in this scenario the interest will be near-0**

I like the article but maybe it need some further finishes, you have to talk about the differences between a symbol with no utility like bitcoin and a home also! Certainly bitcoin is an edge like gold, silver etc, but is more like a bond, or an etf or metals/oil, because after all bitcoin have no utility of be resold later for something else (do not get me wrong, this is a giant utility, the money utility); on the contrary I can use oil to power cars and gold to build circuits for example...
I like the part that talk about programmable loans, and economy in general, I think you appreciate [this](
