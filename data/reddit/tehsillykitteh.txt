Well it wasn't clear if the riots were related.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:18:55
Had a dream last night that Bitcoin hit 35k.... There were riots in the street and everything was on fire...
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:30:21
Not as good as they used to be though
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:04:49
Yo just took a trip to 8/1/19 in my time machine. Bitcoin was at $14,400... But now for easy gains.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:17:29
Here's a fun story.
On 2/9/17 I opened a Roth IRA with $2,000. 
Today that money is worth about $2,300
If I had put that money toward Bitcoin that day it would be worth $23,000 today...

The whales winning doesn't necessitate the rest of us losing. It may add a longer timer, but bitcoin will continue to rise.
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:51:51
Every time you panic and sell the whales win. 
Don't let the whales win. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:09:12
Well that was then... This is now. Alcohol is a hell of a drug. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:30:43
So all we have to do is post Vegeta memes and the bulls will come back? 
I can do that...
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:13:04
Clearly you're new to crypto 
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:14:28
I mean. Im not sure why it's interesting that the logo for a brand called Monster is just Hebrew text for the number of the best...
It's not a conspiracy... It's just creative marketing. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:52:37
I think the ATH is pretty clearly an anomaly in the data though. If I were plotting bitcoins value over time I think I would probably ignore that data when trying to draw a line 
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:35:00
I mean. Easter eggs are a thing. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 01:14:56
This is the old Ri Di Di Di Dah Doo pattern. Solid sign that something will happen at some point, most likely moon soon. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:10:01
Woof here she goes. HODL on tight
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:41:08
This is the secret tip to get rich.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:57:32
I should specify. I buy almost every Thursday... I just happened to break even on this one. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:29:52
I read the WSJ every day and also trade cryptos. Not as absurd an idea as you might think
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:04:05
HODL the line 
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:34:14
Probably quite a few. I had a few Bitcoin in highschool from some goofing with mining and BTC gambling. 
That was 3 desktops and about 12 hard drives ago... 
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:11:25
Just broke even. Feels fucking good man. Time to buy more.  
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:07:06
I actually never saw it touch 9.6. Went straight from 9.59 to 9.7 when I refreshed.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:22:14
What are we thinking? Bottom out around 5k before sling shot to moon?
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:31:46
Is it time? My body is ready.
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:36:09
Also me. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:27:12
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:36:00
*the last 2 minutes actually 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:03:08
Frig off iamdop
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:33:23
Probably just gonna be a Bart tbh... But here's hoping 
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:34:45
TIL 1 year is a few days.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:29:34
I know mate. Just hadn't seen anyone give the default response to a coinbase screenshot, figured it was my turn
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:20:59
Downvoted. Don't be a cuck
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:22:33
Something something not your coins something something
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:33:26
Trezor is solid.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:59:33
I'm way over profit. But I'd have to move my coin from my cold wallet to an exchange to sell... And that sounds exhausting. So I guess I'll hodl
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:21:27
I hope so. Id like to buy a few more coins before moon
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:35:45
You had a lot of money. Now you have fiat. They print more everyday.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:28:06
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:26:26
The secret to hodl:
1. Put your coins in cold storage
2. Lose cold storage
3. ??????
4. Profit
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:45:07
If only 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:53:35
Right now $6,518 is my break even number.
This dip has helped bring that number wayyyy down. 
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:43:01
Had to sell a chunk of coin to pay a debt... You're all welcome for the impending pump
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:39:17
But I'll miss the Vegeta memes... :(
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:17:33
I think home based nodes are fucking brilliant. You'll probably have very little activity, but every single transaction that goes through gets us one step closer to legitimate adoption. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:42:47
Honestly a lot of people will knock it on here, but Coinbase is a really solid starting point. 
It doesn't offer true ownership of crypto but it does let you trade and it's super simple to use. If you're looking to start into crypto, it's a good way to get comfortable before getting serious. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:34:34
Talked the wife into letting me buy some more. Told her the sale was just too good to pass hp
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:05:38
If it goes down to 6k I'll talk my wife into letting me buy more. A sale is a sale. No point waiting for any better
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:03:01
Would you rather have $1 or an item valued at $8000...
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:59:51
This guy gets it.
