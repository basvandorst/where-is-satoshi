how did you make such a mistake? 
One is called Bcash and the other is called Bitcoin, how did you mix that up?

They arent IOUs "entrusted to the Lightning Network", the whole point is that the second layer is trustless and not IOUs and LN is absolutely not a reserve bank!

deposit $23,000 and leverage 100x to get $2.3M positoin size

I think actually its because "lol" evolved into other variations like "lul"  and "lel" (since ppl wanted to be cool and different), and then "lel" evolved into "kek" since the keyboard placement of l and k are next to each other.

The retardation is compounded by the fact that Dubai is an islamist shithole dictatorship so there is no real "governance" to benefit from decentralization

If you want to really confuse things, explain the difference between Plasma, Drivechain and Liquid and LN :P

Needs better GUI integration on the most popular clients... Bitcoin Core and SPV wallet Electrum.
The main exchanges will also catch up eventually.

Exactly. Anyone ignoring S2X is not at risk of loss of BTC funds.
BTC users who only want to transact BTC and do not care about S2X will not lose any BTC.

because in the longrun that just leads to much bigger blockchain size where the only nodes able to initialize and run would be very expensive supercomputers

The "bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin" meme is coming from him. He owns bitcoin.com and r/btc where this is plastered everywhere, so unsophisticated people would be misinformed to think BCH was bitcoin.
these efforts led to a lot of noobs getting tricked into thinking the FUD about "everyone is changing to Bitcoin Cash as the real bitcoin" and people blindly bought into the pump. Those who bought &gt;2,000 USD are at a more than 50% loss.
Bcash is not bitcoin. People who bought into that thinking it was real are now quite harmed.

Yea right, if he was such an advocate he would have been hodling and living off the BTC he believed in so early on.
Instead he does seminars and waffles on critical issues in the community.

The truth is that you are fine to transact Bitcoin post fork even without RP. 
The only real loss of funds risk is loss of B2X shitcoin.
BTC transactions may hang for a bit but the risk of loss of funds is way overblown since your BTC will be fine.

Dude it is 2017, we have whole series storylines revolving around bitcoin/crypto now. 
An episode name is small potatoes these days

Fun fact: this is the daughter of the Bitfinex CEO
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:00:51


no it wouldnt because as soon as it is cracked the price of BTC goes to 0
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:07:00


by "it" do you mean bech32 or your wallet?
ive seen some ppl arguing that using bech32 is bad because some services do not recognize/support them (whether as inputs for transactions or withdrawable to address), which is a weak and circuitous argument imo
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:03:28


yes it does. it humiliates people for being coinless.
the only way to escape the slur of nocoiner is to acquire coin.

I like my digital cash better anyway

wrong, there is Deribit, OKex, and many other players
