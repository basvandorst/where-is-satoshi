The guy's 16... when you're young, you waste money for much worse "investments" than bitcoin.
I'm 45 and investing half my net worth in BTC + LTC + ETH... I can afford to lose it, actually "everybody" can (please note the quotes). If I ever lose that money, I'll start again from scratch (but I'm trying my best to not lose it). I was broke 10 years ago, no big deal, I did it once, can do it again.

I'm french, so I know quite a lot about socialism... and I know health care isn't enough to be happy (otherwise France would be the happiest country in the world, and it's not).
I do live abroad now, and I have a friend from Venezuela. You should talk about socialism with him...

"it's still very good for their current situation": who cares about free education and healthcare when you're starving?
I do understand how socialism is supposed to be full of good will and good people and I see why people want to believe in it... but there's no proof of any sort that socialism is efficient at making people happy (I mean in real life, not in theory).
Maduro is the shadow of Chavez, and both are socialist dictators who don't strive for their people's happiness.
