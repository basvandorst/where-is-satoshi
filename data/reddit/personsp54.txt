there are ppl who turned $1000 into a million. does anyone think those kind of gains can be sustained . the market doesn't give money for free

most likely down sorry

tanking like it does every Sunday/Monday for the past 5 weeks in a row 
I was right again:
The downvoted comments are the ones that are worth reading because they contain needed criticism. not the gorupthink ones that are wrong or overly optimistic

Everything is highly correlated. it means a  whale can dump 1000 coins on Gdax or Gemini and literally make all the other exchanges fall, but also all the alt coins..everything. So that means a $10 million Bitcoin sell order instantly kills off $10-20 billion in total coin market cap . You really think  this can be come a currency and store of value when it is so easy to manipulate? This is why vendor adoption is so slow, among other problems.

if you have  your life savings tied up in bitcoin, you cannot watch the price fall $700+ in an hour and not feel a little anxious  
what s 20 m becomes 40, 60, 80 etc. wont be long before little  left

this thing is crap.  falls 500 points like nothing. literally no fucking liquidity in this market. I mean, it says $9 billion processed a day in bitcoin transactions yet 1000 coins sold makes it fall $500-700 instantly
