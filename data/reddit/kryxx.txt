They are banning their employees from buying more crypto. They can keep any amount they currently own, but are recommended to sell.

It's quite standard in the finance industry due to conflicts of interest and insider trading. For example in the US my partner audited some financial clients and I wasn't allowed to own any stock or investments that those companies were involved with. Every country has these kind of conflict of interest/insider trading type laws.
The bitcoin policy of Nordea isn't quite the same, but disallowing owning of certain things isn't uncommon in the financial industry.

No, if you read the article the decision was made due to distrust in the crypto ecosystem. Volatility and manipulation being some of the reasons.

The difference is one may tax it at 10% and one may tax it at 30%, so huge difference.
I likely won't be making any money off the sell (likely a loss) so to be taxed on the value, making the loss bigger, would be rather unfortunate. I'm trying to avoid that.

Uhhh, I'm not really trying to do anything illegal. I am a US citizen who lives abroad - I'm just trying to prevent losing more money when I sell my &lt;30 bitcoins.

Thanks for this info! After looking at it it will indeed be treated as a capital loss so I can sell in the US without issue. That's likely the easiest option.
If I need it in SEK I'll look into the options there.
