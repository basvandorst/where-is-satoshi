His grammar is off here as well. Pineapple and jalapenos are good pizza toppings.

Why? It's not as if you honestly think I'm going to bring you every piece of "garbage" I find on the internet. 
Is this your buddy cryptorebel?
Please read my first comment again, as you haven't answered any of my questions.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:24:10
Is there anything else we should be doing to prepare for the hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:51:46
I seem inclined to believe anything I read? You seem quite bitter and hostile. Surely you realize now  you're quick to make these kinds of assumptions. I think its quite clear I'm simply looking to better my understanding. I have no idea who cryptorebel is. Thanks for your level headed receptiveness.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:26:43
Are you saying he's lying? Did you even bother looking into it? Or are you a shill? Or just someone who can't handle the truth? Just trying to figure out why you would respond this way.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:47:33
WtF are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:45:51
Yeah pretty creepy we're being downvoted as well

Nah, he wouldn't associate himself with Verge or Bitconnect.
