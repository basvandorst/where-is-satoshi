Do you think this all happened in the last week? Cryptsy has been around for longer than most exchanges and proved itself to be reliable and legally compliant every step of the way. There will be no "gtfo of dodge" since the goal here is to continue providing above average service in a sea of trolls. Do you really think they would go through all the trouble of registering for a MSB license and registering if that were the case?

I agree. google "cryptotard" and you see the exact thing that k1ll3r5mur4 is talking about. A little kid running around yelling scam at everything.

Go ahead and try for yourself. The people determine the market.

You can just do this inside your mining software or setup backups on rental sites. But if you were to do it like this, you wouldnt even need pool participation.. Just make it so users can put their own pool info into the site.

If they dont I cant imagine why they would be trolling so hard. Probably because they need to be verified to trade USD on cryptsy and are crying about it.

To get more business? Pretty simple. Why does Pepsi still have commercials if everyone knows their products?

Common business practice to incorporate elsewhere. GE does it actually, and they are one of the largest technology manufacturers in the world.

I already answered this question. Many companies incorporate in other countries.. Actually most large corporations.

Really? Whats your problem with bill gates?

USD uses tons of electric, emits greenhouse gasses etc etc... Remember that most USD transactions are via the internet and 100% digital. All of this infrastructure uses a massive amount of resources and as for the rest (the 'physical' money) it still has to be driven around in large armoured vehicles that cost a lot of resources to build and probably 10x the fuel cost of a regular vehicle to move. My point is... Your point is invalid and meaningless. Doing everything in our society requires resources.

Know Your Customer verification is required by US law, its not just coinbase
