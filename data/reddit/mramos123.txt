What are you fighting for? At the end of the day don't you want Crypto to win and fiat to fall?
We're all fighting for the same shit, yet you kind of people fuck that up "BCH vs BTC" "ETH vs every ETH 'Clone'" just stop. 
It's fucking pathetic and it doesn't help you or anyone in the long run, it just makes the Crypto community look like a bunch of whiny little kids throwing 'fake money' around. 
This whole argument is tiring and repetitive.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:19:14
You're fighting a losing battle, they stick so close to their opinion and refuse to let anyone change it.
I wrote this for that other dude; 
IMO, the whole argument is fucking pathetic it helps no one, especially when the other person refuses to reason. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:55:29
Tfw when you have a stick so far up your arse and you refuse to reason and just spam bullshit that doesn't match your current agenda.

I mean I agree with everything has said, yet my account isn't new.

Please correct me where I'm wrong, but couldn't he drop it into any privacy coin, withdraw little bits at a time and be done with it?
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:45:05
I don't understand why he's mixing it all when I think that's a much easier way to? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:48:16
I'm so conflicted. Can someone give me a TL;DR, ELI5 of pros and cons of Segwit?
Keep in mind I'm your typical user of Bitcoin and only do like 1 transaction a month and mostly hold and don't spend. 
If someone has already wrote up about the pros and cons in a ELI5/Short apologies.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:32:01
Bitcoin Cash maybe?

Make sure you update us.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:09:16
Fuck the medicine, he's potentially got loads of BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:21
Depends on how much you're making.
I doubt you'd want to flaunt your bank account if you were making $100,000 per month or had $10,000,000 in your bank account.
People get greedy for money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:04:37
Some people just don't care, I've asked people before (expecting them to back down) and they open their online banking and show me. If they do this is that when you go "I invested X at Y"?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:04:28
Ah I got you. But the problems with Google Auth, like I've just found out is that if I reset, or get a new device I lose everything. :(
There's no really good way. IMO. At least without disabling 2FA for a few mins whilst you reset it up.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:08:43
Yeah I doubt that. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:29:35
I wouldn't be in this problem if it was SMS 2FA because I only reset my phone.
I was using Google Authentication, now I'm using Authy because it saves it if I ever reset in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:51:09
But that's just the principle of 'real money' and trade, right? If I have some goods to sell I want to sell it so that I make a profit, so isn't that a pyramid scheme? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:52:51
At least you guys can buy BTC. I fucked up majorly. :(
I reset my phone without taking down 2FA for my Blockchain wallet, so no recovery right now. Having to go to their support. I truly hope they reply soon.
FYI, make sure to disable 2FA for any online wallets before breaking or resetting your phone. 
EDIT: Put in the 2FA removal, apparently it removes in 7 days automatically. Good, but that's awhile. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:15:50
Don't lmao. Just hold it. Why sell because of a tiny fluctuation? I wouldn't even sell if it dropped 2k in a few days, it's already done that a few times. No need to panic sell, just hold on and try to enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:08:15
Hey, that's actually really cool, it follows a similar path as the actual market value.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:36:36
$300 USD per BTC? What. It's $6,000~ USD per BTC right now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:31:44
What happened?

stop pls
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:27:00
How did you make this? Can you make it an online app or something?
As BTC goes up, it adds a few more coins and it goes down they fall out the bottom etc etc. Just a fun thing to watch instead of a bar chart. haha
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:47:21
I'm familiar with Unity engine. Very nice.
Good job, I'll save this post to see if you manage to make it a web-app. :D
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:05:52
Meh, I don't look at the news.
However, the whole China thing is everywhere.
Still gonna hold.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:30:28
Ah, got you. Thanks for clearing that up.

Prove to me you can remember your private keys, recite it here. ^^^^/s
    Private Key [                                                ]

Hmm, can't be your private key because all I see is *********

I guess this was a load of bullshit because OP deleted his post.
So much for setting a reminder.
Karma whoring to another level I guess.
- I used your reminder link. Eh, this is a bit depressing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:18:25
I was like "wow it's growing, I want to be apart of it." and here we are now. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:43:22
Understood, got a bit lost there.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:39:05
I sent off £150~ with a £0.70 fee (really low, I know my bad.), been 28 hours no Confirmations yet. 
Also, if anyone cares to answer, what happens if my transaction never confirms? I've read that after 72 hours it'll cancel and return to your original wallet, but I can't seem to find much proof on this. I don't know how to 'add a higher fee' to an already created transaction, and I don't have any more money in that wallet as I was moving the money. 
What happens if my transaction never clears? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:21:43
What's wrong? (Curious as a somewhat-beginner)
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:28:57
For the lazy
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:21:55
He did by breaking them though.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:28:48
What are you trying to prove, all of his points are valid, yet you seem to just try and find little nit-pickable irrelevant information? 
From what I gather from your responses you've been hurt my BTC, failed trades? Scammed? 
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:16:31
CLICKBAIT BULLSHIT!
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:20:42
What do you think I should do with my ETH? Should I convert it to BTC or hold it like I'm also holding BTC.
