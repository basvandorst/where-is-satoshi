If he spreads out the withdrawals between this year and next - why would that Lower the tax burden?  
His situation is considered long term cap gains right? 
Assuming he would need to move to under the $225k a year joint bracket  - dropping from 20% to 15%
So he would need to spread it to over 5 years of withdrawals to lower his tax burden (and that’s if he doesn’t earn a dime outside of BTC)
- just curious I’m not a tax guy at all 
EDIT - i am wrong - brackets work by taxing earnings up to that amount, then any money after is taxed at the next bracket and so on

as soon as i saw the email saying now trading bcash - i knew it was gonna suck 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:48:41
Yup - still brackets 
If this new tax bill passes I know it’s gonna change it big time 
So I’d not sell yet lol

It’s .. definitely addicting especially if you have skin in the game 
Down side is it will make you anxious and want to touch your money more. Don’t

i've bought bitcoin without fees for the last 5 months - it just takes 6 days to clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:00:15
So we have a $1k difference — curious what’s the feasibility of taking advantage of that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:27:02
Good point - that would save him $10k so that’s not chump change — 
I was assuming he meant half now and half later since he didn’t give specifics 
basically every year he stays under the highest bracket would save him $10k
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:29
Same — my averaged coin price is creeping up every time I buy though - currently $7,455
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:46
$14k... this is madness 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:44:29
Ooooooh wow ... 
I had no idea your income is taxed at different rates up to the next bracket - I just thought it was a total % off your total number 
— now I’m remembering I was wondering about that before with income , and That makes sense actually - because if you make a bit more to put you in the next tax bracket you would actually be making less money
Thanks for the lesson ����
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:37:22
What do you mean double the amount taxed at lower rates? Won’t that result in the same amount owed?
20% of 500k x2 is the same as 20% of 1m 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:52:58
Did you see the value go down after cashing out?
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:21:46
the reason to disconnect from the net is because of fear of malware? is that a realistic threat? even on like... a fresh install of windows? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:28:52
i thought it was, if you drop it on the ground, then click it and open your inventory at the time time (with you inventory only having enough room for one of the item) - you will have the one in your inventory and one will be in a picked up state by your mouse 
thats how i got all my BTC anyway 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:10:55
thats exactly my problem..... I sold off my initial investment once it hit 10k.... but its just sitting there. I have no immediate need for that Fiat... it would just be sitting in my savings 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:04:20
yeah I fucked up by selling all my coins, then buying back in with half from the FOMO. 
basically... im paying double the tax I should of because i'm an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:40:03
Im just so surprised that people do spend it without FOMO 
I’m a hodler from $2k — which wasn’t even that long ago! If I bought anything with BTC i would feel like I paid almost 5x what I should have 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:46:49
once you have a million dollars in the bank... you can survive off the interest pretty much. 
its easy to get 10% a year on the low end... so more than most people make
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:11:30
I sold at 9600.... then i missed you guys so I bought back in at 10600
hurray for taxable events! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:25:54
So buy BTC with other currency then move to coin base?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:54
theres no fee if you ACH into coinbase as US $ - then buy on GDAX as a limit order
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:32:00
I mean I probably wont actually sell — 
But I’m worried about that S curve — and I need to actualize gains at some point. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:47:54
sold @ 9600... bought back in @ 10700
am i doing that right? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:19:26
what did that do? 
all my BTC are in coinbase - I was gonna leave it in there to get the split... but if the split isn't happening  idk
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:43:13
Yup - totally with you. Even if you bought something a month ago BTC you would’ve spent double what it’s worth by now
I feel like we’re entering Mexican standoff with all hodlers- who is going to start the chain reaction of pulling out first and causing the crash 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:45
how old are you? if you get out soon dont you end up paying a lot more % than just cap gainz? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:10:06
Ridiculous - it was JUST at 8k
How could anyone use BTC to buy stuff with these constant gains 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:38
the silver lining on this scenario - is the FOMO crowds entry - which ... honestly looks like it was this week... will make it the new floor. --- which I feel is around that 5k drop we saw last .... month? 
everyone's saying potential crash of 75%.. but BTC doesn't have stop losses to set a death spiral -- so I feel like it wont be as harsh. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:51:27
How / where are you buying them from? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:02:01
lol I was one of the guys saying i'll probably sell @ 9k...  it all happened so fast i didnt even have time to think about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:03:49
BRB gonna hoard some credit cards
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:28:20
Yeah and what ever happened to doge coins? I think I got tipped like 5 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:34:36
I always ask this question - it’s been so crazy in its appreciation that I cannot fathom someone spending  - at its currents rate - if you bought something with BTC last month you basically almost paid double the value vs if you used a paper currency!
and the only answer I get is that spend it then buy more 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:31:20
honest question - how can someone cash out that much bitcoin?   like logistically how does that work 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:18:51
“It’s over 9000” 
That’s my cash out point I think
