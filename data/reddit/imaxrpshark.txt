If you use coinbase to purchase you can move it to GDAX FOR FREE, then trade or move it from there at no or low cost.  Have you tried this yet??? probably not so give it a go and see how that works out.

@_date: 2018-01-26 01:37:36
Trade for free, watch the video they have on their site. You still pay margin fees. But no fee for buy or sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:51:10

Dropping btc yes, for stellar hmmmmm we’ll have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:06:42
I don’t use bitcoin, but what a fucking idiot. I want the whole space to grow but stupid ass people like this should DIE. 
PSA, if anyone says shit about exchanges getting hacked, ask them how many banks got robbed back in the early 1900’s. That will shut them up. Grrrrrrrr I hate Mother fuckers like this.

It takes ons to know one, or if youre smart like me you know what scams are through watching the world turn and reading articles and books.  You’re a fucking idiot too for saying stupid things like that.  
If some one is a man and they know what a women is, you’re saying the man is a women because it takes one to know one. Bahahaha. Moron.

wtf is walter coin hahahaha 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:32:32
i think that there are other options that are moving a lot faster technically wise.  One that does research will find that yes bitcoin was intended for wallet to wallet, but it hasn't improved, nor was not meant to be anything but wallet to wallet transfers,  there are so many other coins that move faster with more utility than bitcoin has, with that it was the pioneer but that may be all it will be in the future.

@_date: 2018-01-12 17:08:14
lol, yup. only the hardcores keep it off the exchanges, exchanges are centralized. i just don't get it sometimes
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:45:19
OP is hoping that bitcoin crashes to make themselves feel good that they didn't miss out on a shit ton of money. 
Even if it did crash OP still lost out on a shit ton of money

@_date: 2018-01-12 19:52:22
the ship has left already, will it come back to pick up another group to head there, well i guess we will see if the ship makes it back to earth in one piece. If so then the second trip to the moon is on it's way. 
I think alot of people bought at 10k or higher that are still around so that moon shot will have to see bitcoin go to 100k, for 10x return. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:19:11

oh is that what happen, cool
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:49:43
um, ya,there is someone that can take control and work out problems, how is that whole consensus thing working out for your coin, oh that's right, no one can agree so just keep fighting and solve no problem, charge people 40 bucks to move money around, have coins that can't be moved because it cost more then what the actual coin is worth. ahhhhhh what else.......too much to list.  oh ya enjoy and happy new year.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:21:29
That's slow xrp 4 secs. Have fun with that 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:51:40

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:07:32
i just withdrew, since you dont use it how the fuck would you know.  This clearly is FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:08:09
im in other coins and when i cashed out with btc i never had any problems, then again, the ATM i used set the fee accordingly.  i can't help you out past this, hope it all works out for you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:03:25
yes you are right, but speed test wise no one compares.  I though i was going to get shit on about this alot worse lol. good day lads
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:35
So, an attack, like a coordinated spam on the network. Hahahaha. I'm in. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:46

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:23:40
it you own 11 million bitcoin then yes. lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:20:40
be prepared that when transferring  from an exchange to nano it could send and receive within seconds, or it could take hours or days so don't panic when this happens 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:47:58

@_date: 2017-12-02 00:13:29
who know
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:48
because its all centralized hahahaha  what you thought other wise
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:35:31
How did I contradict myself. I'm pretty intelligent. Got in on xrp at .008cents. Good luck with bitcoin. I made over 22000%. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:36:33
Have fun with the $40 tx fees.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:31:56
get a wallet and move your coins there, 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:24:24
Dont forget about the SPAM, unconfirmed tx over quarter MIILION,  WHO REACHES 1 MILLION FIRST, UNCONFIRMED TX OR BITCOIN SUB REDDIT SUBSCRIBERS HAHAHAHA 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:48:36
it was three days ago, dont know what's up now
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:54:08

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:28
look in to the ledger nano s, i have it and it's fantastic, really easy to use blah blah blah, make sure you buy it from the ledger's official site though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:02:42
the value will probably go up though, thats the funny thing
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:35:43
i guess if you live in the states this will suck, 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:06:13
wrong sub 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:02:08
wait, what a great idea this coin is.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:16:33
The price will never go below 6k, if it ever dropped it would be because of the hashrate flipping, no one would be able to move btc ever again hence, only coins on an exchage will be sold and never moved again.  Worst case scenario of course
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:27:31
DA=difficulty adjustment, read on how bitcoin blockchain works, every 2 weeks it will adjust the difficulty in how miners can find blocks to have transactions be confirmed.  you can find the DA and a whole buch of other cool stuff at  as well if you want to see how many transactions are unconfirmed at any point go to 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:29:25
Because it does it every time (every 2weeks) new year it will happen again.  Research it bros it's crazy easy money making 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:09:38
well, you clearly have not read up on how xrp works, it is decentralized so this conversation is clearly with an ignorant person, sorry you don't like to read up on issues pertaining to the ecosystem but when you do i know you will be more knowledgeable and think twice before replying with incorrect facts. good day sir
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:52:51
Nope, unfortunately the people in this sub are pretty cancerous. Your transaction will probably take a while. B t c unfortunate has become almost impossible to move around so you will just have to wait, it could take a day or two. But if it doesn't go through it will be sent back to the original sending address you used. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:42:05
im not going to tell you what to do other then research of the DA and see how the price reacts, make your own decisions on when to buy and sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:55:20
I would love it to be regulated.  Yay. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:17
Always an attack when the price goes down. You guys are fuckng idiots. This happens every two weeks. In a week it will be normal and then attack. Fml. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:58:13
Yes you and I do
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:48:00
They are regulated by the government in the US. So no to mt.gox. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:34
you make your own wallet and then buy coins to give out to those wallets that were made by yourself.  You don't buy someone else's wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:38:45
Everyone wants you to hold and then be dicks, great sub

@_date: 2018-03-14 18:18:00
wrong, square is trading at 54 dollars and it what at 34 jan 1, that is not 49% 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:46:35
you can buy a soda, just cost you more btc now then it did when you first bought in, 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:02:49
If you have an app that may be able to do this. The legal way would be, “hey, anyone that has lost their btc can sign up to my app that can help you recover your lost coins. You make money from subscribers and it’s totally legal”. You going forward with the business method you have in mind will lead you to jail in a heartbeat. Good day 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:10:52
But you can’t so BEAR with it. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:14:02
This is fantastic that this person/s got their money back,  I hope this leads to many more cases for people that have lost money in the wake of coinbase' negligence.  Good luck to all that fight the beast.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:44:52
Or it was drug money that he sent you and it’s now washed clean from his hands. You could be in trouble for money laundering.

You will always get both kinda of advice here. Lesson learned and I hope all works out for you. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:56:27
So if someone is holding bitcoin from 2011 and they have not used the account because of whatever reason. You have an app that will take their bitcoin. That is fraud my friend. Might want to start putting some money away for a retainer. You’ll need a lawyer yesterday.
