Here's the problem with associating "open borders" to what's happening in Europe.
The government of Europe is forcing their own citizens to get out of their homes and force migrants to live with them. In the USA, we own our property, and at least the bankers who own the mortgages for most people's homes in this country wouldn't ever want to force their own customers to take in migrants. ( Unless some form of marketing occurs, like migrant promotions and stupid shit like that or whatever )

If Bitcoin were truly "free as in freedom", it'd be licensed under the GPL and NOT the MIT license of all the damn things..

Ah, because I thought I heard somewhere that Dwolla stopped the use of bitcoins last year.
@_date: 2012-02-11 21:10:12
Well, I DO, but what happens when I run out is what I'm saying.

Wow, how did I completely miss that? I've been looking everywhere to find a PC parts store for bitcoins!
Problem is is that there's not much of a selection on Intel CPU's and Video cards. :/

Can you do the opposite? Like, converting bitcoins to USD, by using MTGOX that brings it to Dwolla and your bank?
@_date: 2012-02-12 03:18:42
Oh no, I wouldn't do that, especially since Bitcoins are still experimental. I'm experimenting with these bitcoins, I'd like to buy some basic PC parts using bitcoins somewhere.
My current question still stands, how do I convert bitcoins to usd? Do I have to be linked to a bank account in MTGOX or something?

I might have the same problem as you, although I went to the "free" bitcoins places on the bitcoin.it wiki. I think I put in the same address for each website that gives me the free bitcoins, could that be a problem?
@_date: 2012-02-12 06:13:44
Where does it say that?
@_date: 2012-11-14 21:14:59
Ah, well I guess the transactions didn't work properly since I'm still bitcoinless. So I guess I've got nothing to worry about (for now at least).

Uh.. I'm on silk road and.. it's a scary place lol
From what I've seen, I'm probably not gonna risk it there, unless someone can give me an idea of what exactly goes on in there.. and if it's safe, although I'm a bit naive.
Anyways, thanks for all of your guy's help, I think I got the right idea, only is it through a bank account that has to be connected to MTGOX like Paypal in order to get my USD?
@_date: 2012-02-11 21:03:35
But then I have to pay USPS, how would I go about doing that? Would I just go to MTGOX and exchange some bitcoins for USD to pay the shipping fee?

If you're talking about retail stores, then I don't really know.

Unity is perfect, hands down, and honestly I'd probably still stick to an iPhone before Android, I have my own PC to handle Bitcoins.
