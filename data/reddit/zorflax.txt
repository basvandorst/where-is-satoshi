I actualy started a [thread]( about this recently. The response was generally dismissive, but I am still confident this will happen.

You cant go wrong with [any of these phones](

I had a similar idea earlier this month I decided to call "MetaCoin". It would be a crypto used inside of virtual reality worlds to exchange for goods and services. You can read the thread which goes into more detail [here]( Palmer Luckey weighed in on the topic! It was a good debate :)

The comments that were AGAINST net neutrality were faked. There were millions of organic pro-net neutrality comments submitted.

No, many many people donate for free.

Can you elaborate?

If you are on a budget, I recommend [dollar cost averaging]( Will coinbase fees considered, I recommend making weekly buys on Sunday evenings.
