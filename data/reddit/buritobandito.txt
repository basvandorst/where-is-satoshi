take this info with a grain of salt. They say there are releasing this product in late dec. This product i was gonna use on an alt coin but by the time we receive it, it would be an uphill battle to make your money back. Now they are saying they will release the product in feb on their twitter page. Same cycle is happening with product delays and even then when they are ready to ship, there would be limited supplies in the first batch so you might not be guaranteed anything until a 2nd batch comes through which could take possibly months.

being legit here man. They are fucking all customers in the sense that when they revealed the units back a year ago people were excited and ordered. BFL had those miners made quick so that they could use your product to mine. Then when the miners didn't make enough due to diff going up, they send it to you guys. You guys get fucked cause they have been used and they break down causing a shit storm. BFL are scumbags and for all those fuckers who disagree with me are really really fucking stupid. The comp knows what they have done which they are profiting off your machines before sending them out.

Got it from the bitcoin.org site doesn't matter anymore I'm over it but I don't want to have an online wallet. I feel more secure with a paper wallet. Know any good ones? When using armory I think it said building database or something. When I hit 90% I was at 1gb left. From there folders started to disappear, the application folder in the windows start up button, users folder, and music files, etc. I don't want to make the same mistake twice now that I know happened.

yes becuase i was running out of room so the HD started deleting other folders and info to make more room. I was using armory to set up the bitcoin wallet and when armory was in motion, i didn't think twice when my HD went below 100mb and then spiked back to 600mb before i knew it, it deleted a bunch of my fucking shit. That process happened 5-6 times before i realized what it was doing. Cant do a system restore so now i gotta wipe the HD and start all over. Another 4 hours of this shit just to get back to my normal operating system.

excuse my noob question but what does this block erupter exactly mean?

its not a wild speculation they actually used customers products to mine the BTC until they realized A) the diff is too high so start shipping them or B) the diff is approaching at such a high level that they should ship out the products before the miners no longer profit and leave doubt in people. Explain to me why 1000's of customers got their ASICs and said they have been used? You don't know the whole story. Why do you think they always delayed the shipment? They clearly have had these products made quick but don't want to send them out just yet until they can use the customers miners to make profit in the meantime. Dude, actually think and stop protecting a fake ass company. Sounds like you work for them.
1) Take preorders to build first batch of miners
2) Start mining using said miners
3) Don't ship unit till it has mined enough btc to pay for itself + 2 more units
4) Repeat

dogecoin to the moon
EDIT: can you fucking believe that dogecoin is the only one in green on

hmm interesting. 1 chip = 85h/s at $65.5 USD per chip.
1 R9 290 GPU card is clocked between 815-840 h/s and costs between $400-$550 (due to price bump because a shitload of people are buying these)
So 10 x 85h/s = 850h/s x 65.5 USD = $655 excluding tax and shipping. This new option is about $100 more expensive but it probably uses less energy.

I was using the application armory. I first had to download all the block chain to finish the armory security measures. I asked this very subreddit to help me stop the app in taking my hd storage because I was running really low. No one helped fast enough to the point when my hard drive hit 0, I thought the application would stop. No it didn't. Once it hit 0 it refresed showing 700mb left and started going down again. Thought It was cleaning up some old files and not deleting my files. By the 6th time I realized it deleted a lot of my files. Now I have to reinstall everything because I lost a lot of folders and specific commands that I use from windows that couldn't be recovered

They did scam people. They promised to ship these units out but they didn't, why you ask because at that time the miners were so powerful you could makes $100's a day back then. BFL decided to use the customers product that they paid for to mine BTC in the meantime to capitalize on the low difficulty factor. Once the difficulty raised to the point the miners weren't making money, they shipped them out to customers. They fucked everyone over and should be sued. Hope those faggots go to hell for what they did.

used armory to lock my bitcoin wallet and it was doing something to take my space. You dont know shit until you experience it. You really think im lying....im fucking pissed cause i gotta restore my whole HD drive.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:42:27
yep you said it right. I hope to fuck those guys get sued even though i didn't invest. What a dirty business practice to get customers money to build the product to then use it until the diff goes up and then ship them. Disgusting practices if you ask me. Other companies are actually doing the same especially with the new scrypt miners as well.
