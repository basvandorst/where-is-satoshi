It's value is not based on US dollars, or British Pounds Sterling, or ounces of gold.  What you *are* referencing, is simply the exchange rate between two objects that both have value (bitcoins and dollars).
We say that a bitcoin is "worth" $800, because that's the unit of value (dollars) you're most familiar with in your day to day life.  You exchange that unit of value for goods and services on a regular basis.
But what would we say $1 is "worth"?  You might think of a can of soda.. or 1/2 dozen eggs.. whatever.  The point is that anything that has value must be measured with respect to something else of value.  Even with US Dollars.  Value is ultimately subjective.
If 1/2 dozen eggs are worth $1, then it's just as correct to say that one bitcoin is worth 400 dozen eggs as it is to say it's worth $800.  There is no objective reference for value, just convenience.
The interesting question to ask would be "why does Bitcoin have value" to begin with.  Once you acknowledge that it does have value, it's logical that it must have an *some* exchange rate with other units of value.

If you were dumb enough to exchange back to USD at the bare bottom the next day, I suppose.  Anyone that's held BTC for any reasonable period of time has not lost 1/2 their value.  The emotional crowd though wets their pants about infrequent drops (while conveniently ignoring any day to day gains).
Where is the opposite of your post when the price goes up the next day?  "omg omg!  But my dollars don't gain 25% over night!$%"

@_date: 2014-01-07 02:41:15
Because, over time, those 1m coins would never be exchanged.  Price is determined by where supply meets demand.  A decreased supply of bitcoins in the market would manifest itself through market forces over time.
1m bitcoins removed from the "market" for 1 day probably wouldn't effect where market supply/demand met.  If that same 1m bitcoins were removed for 100 years, that probably would have a significant effect.
No one needs to *know* that you lost X number of bitcoins.  Equilibrium is determined in time by market forces that are influenced by the supply (whatever it may be).

It's a remarkably simple rebuttal.  No other payment technology, aside from perhaps cash in hand, clears payments in less time.  Businesses offer what is essentially "insurance", to enable companies to accept payments, knowing full well that some percentage will end up being chargebacks, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:10:29
Where does it say that something of value, such as a currency, must be "backed" by something?  Backing is a liability, not an asset.  It's not a positive attribute for a currency.
People say the US dollar is backed by "the full faith and credit of the US Gov't".  Of course, you could always take one more step and say "yea... but what backs that?"  It's an infinite regression.  At some point, you just need to throw your hands up and say "yea...  this 'thing' *does* seem to have value".  It seems to me that a technology that allows you to teleport arbitrary amounts of value anywhere in the world, at near zero cost is *valuable*, in and of itself.  But maybe I'm crazy.

@_date: 2014-01-29 03:35:16
Well, you could say "what if Bitcoin was the world reserve currency someday".  What would it's value then be?  For that, you need just look at the US dollar.
Since the US dollar is *already* the world reserve currency, it's a negotiable instrument for practically anything (of value).  So if Bitcoin became big enough, over time, you would slowly begin to think of it as you do the US dollar today..  as being the reserve value that everything else is measured against.  You would think of 1 bitcoin the same way you think of $1 today... by thinking about what goods and services you could exchange it for, rather than it's exchange rate with another currency.
The point remains though that the US dollar has no special position.  It's just the easiest point of reference for understanding value because it's accepted today for practically anything and we use it on a daily basis.  If we paid for everything with egg shells everyday, or bitcoins, you would think of that object as the point of reference.

I wonder if the issue is further influenced by the way in which people *hear* about Bitcoin.  For example, a media source that specializes in technology or finance (BusinessInsider, TechCrunch) is more likely to feature stories on Bitcoin.  For the most part, the audience of these media sources consists of men.  Therefore, women are less likely to hear about Bitcoin.  As you say, it's not *necessarily* that they wouldn't take more interest, but that they simply aren't presented with the topic as often. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:05:59
They might also care about security.  Bitcoin is, at a fundamental level, far more secure than Credit Cards for electronic transactions.  Credit Cards were never designed for the Internet.  They're a 1950s technology.  With a Credit Card, you literally are entrusting a third party (like Target) with what is essentially your banking details and password every time you make a purchase.  Bitcoin uses digital signatures in a novel way to avoid this, along with the counter party risk, etc.  Lower friction, more efficient digital cash.
Today, start ups all over are building technology on top of the platform that will make Bitcoin easier to use online for the typical, non-tech user.

In a matured market, they would have to, or lose business.  You can take your question to the extreme by asking why the company doesn't charge $100 for a soda, or $1000, instead of the market rate, and then pocket the difference.  The answer should be obvious.  Because business would begin drifting to the company offering the better deal.  In the case of a matured Bitcoin marketplace, it would move to the company that *did* provide a discount for Bitcoin purchases (by passing on the savings).  That's just how free markets work.

They won't.  Anyone with that much BTC knows it's a binary outcome, and they're in it for everything or nothing at all.  They had no intention of dumping after a 4x increase or whatever, especially knowing that the liquidity lacks today.  If Bitcoin succeeds, they won't need to dump.  They will be in the upper echelon.
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:10:35
It's an emerging technology, with a relatively small market cap.  There is still poor liquidity, and market depth.  These things will change in time, as Bitcoin moves away from being a purely (nearly) speculative instrument.  Right now Bitcoin is like an early stage start up that the market is trying to value.

No worries..
That's true.  The idea I guess is that there should be an electronic equivalent to cash.  With cash, you have the option.  You don't need to use one of a limited number of companies.  With online payments, you didn't have that option.
Let's say I go to Target to buy $50 worth of groceries.  I can pay with my Visa, but I don't *have* to.  If Visa is taking advantage of me, financially, I can elect to pay with cash.  Collectively, as society, we can do this.  We have that option and freedom.  Before something like Bitcoin, you didn't have that option online.  Thus, you were exposed, at least in a theoretical sense, to being taken for a ride by these companies.  This problem grows as the world becomes ever more digital.  Bitcoin removes the necessity of counter parties for electronic transactions.  It is nothing more than the distributed protocol, or standard, that everyone can participate in (to everyones advantage).

It's basic economics that present value is expected future value times likelihood of occurrence, adjusted for the time value of money.  That's how speculation works...  that's how stocks are priced (based on expected future earnings).
What gives Bitcoin "inherent value" (utility, is a better word) is it's specific attributes, and potential as a decentralized protocol that decreases friction, allows for programmable "smart" money applications, increases security, enables zero trust contracts, etc....  Technology that innovates and disrupts can have value, regardless of the fact that you can't hold the source code in your hand.  No one would argue that Internet Protocol doesn't have value, considering all of the technology we've built on top of that protocol over the past ~20 years.  The difference with Bitcoin is that an inherent part of the technology is the introduction of *scarcity*, since this is a requirement of transferable value.  
You can actually think of an analogy to internet domain names (".com's").  In 1992, you could have bought up all the ".com's" of shapes for example (circle.com, square.com, etc.).  This is analogous, in some respects, to purchasing bitcoins today, since there is clearly a scarcity of such domain names.  You could also view purchasing those domain names in 1992 as a bet on an increase in demand of domain names in the future.  That doesn't necessarily mean you'd think there was a bubble in domain names, but rather that you believed the Internet would succeed and have great value at some point in the future.
The difficult part for speculators is trying to predict the future essentially.. both in terms of risks and what will be developed on top of the platform.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:47:40
It's pretty simple, today.  People have invested in Bitcoin, and they want to see that technology succeed and adoption increase.  They're supporting the ecosystem by spending bitcoins.  The 1% "extra fee" is more than made up by the aggregate support of the ecosystem.
Eventually, in time, services like consumer protection, etc, that are offered for Credit Cards will arise for Bitcoin.  This is nothing fundamental about "dumb money" (paper dollars) or "smart money" (digital currency).  It's just, in essence, an insurance policy offered by a third party.  
Ultimately, Bitcoin transactions will be better for all parties because they are lower friction...  there is no counter party risk.  Bitcoin is the superior bedrock, or platform, on which to build.  Read this:

You're confused.  Bitcoin is a technology.  Paper fiat is a technology (a rather shitty one).  Technology is not owned by a company or any third party.  Third parties build solutions *on* technology, to service the market.
I can think of no logical reason why a third party, like a Coinbase, couldn't offer consumer protection on bitcoin purchases in the future, assuming, of course, you're using their services.  The point with Bitcoin is that you don't *have* to use their services (or pay, indirectly, for that protection).  The market is simply not matured yet.  It's like the internet in 1993.
What consumer protection do you have on one hundred dollars in your physical wallet?  Think of Bitcoin that way.  Think of your bank (third party) as a company like Coinbase.

Let's say a company like Target partnered with Coinbase to accept Bitcoin payments.  
Coinbase would collect their percentage fee (just like Visa would) on transactions, and Coinbase would eat the risk that someone double spends or whatever.  Payments would be accepted with zero confirmations.  There will always be some theoretical risk that someone double spends before a payment confirmation, but there are other ways of mitigating that risk (aside from the mental reenforcement of security cameras, chances of getting tackled in the parking lot, etc.).
10 minute average confirmation time wasn't picked for no reason.  That should also be kept in mind.  There is a security tradeoff. Satoshi was intelligent enough, and he could have chosen a 10 second confirmation time.

@_date: 2016-03-26 13:05:38
All excellent points and - for any readers - I would ask you to question the motives of someone who anonymously goes back to edit such an image, to then include ad hominem and personal attacks against the development team.  Clearly the "FUD Bubble" is still deflating...  (and some are getting desperate)
Just like outside the realm of "digital" currencies, actions speak louder than words.  I would ask any new reader, really looking to critique the development team and their motives, to consider the following...
1) Look at who comprises Blockstream and their history (as cypherpunks, etc.).  What do their actions and interests tell you about their commitment to the technology?  To concepts like decentralization, encryption, personal freedom?
2) Look at the monetary incentives in place.  Blockstream employees are paid, in part, with time-locked bitcoins, in order to demonstrate to the community that their incentives are aligned with Bitcoin's long term success.  What are the financial incentives for others?  Really think about this..   Have they demonstrated, *through their actions*, a commitment to Bitcoin's development and security?
3) Objectively speaking, who has developed Bitcoin to date?  Research this, looking at the github repository and other statistics.  Who's committed their time and resources to the project over these past years?  Who are the experts with the specialized knowledge?
4) Who invested in Blockstream?  It might make sense to analyze these entities, and hear what and how they speak about the technology.  Was their investments in Blockstream purely for Blockstream's commercial success (business ROI), or also for the value creation side chains, lightning network (decentralized), etc., could bring to the ecosystem as a whole?  To give an example, if you were hodling a large stack of Bitcoins, it might make sense to support a company like Blockstream, simply because their work will distribute value across the entire ecosystem, and thus increase the value of one's Bitcoin hodlings (in due time).
5) Take the time to research technology like the Lightning Network and side chains.  I say this only because of the amount of misinformation you'll find in typical comments is astounding.  You're intelligent enough to have found your way to the topic of Bitcoin already, and seem to take some interest (considering you're browsing r/bitcoin).  That, in and of itself, is a testament to you! 
Self-empowerment through educating yourself on the topics is the best line of defense.  And, unfortunately, you aren't going to get educated on the topic from r/bitcoin.  Scour YouTube, articles, white papers, other resources.  Look down that rabbit hole, close your eyes and just JUMP.

@_date: 2016-03-26 22:29:42


I like Gavin, and I don't at all think he has ill intent.  I simply think he's wrong.  Objectively wrong.  My intention was more to defend the Core developers, who are far more frequently attacked for "ulterior motives".  It's important for new users and enthusiasts to be aware that these are not fly-by-night developers.  They're entitled to the same respect that Gavin is.
What does Classic have the gain?  Control, in a very real sense.  Do I think that influences people like Gavin?  No.  Coinbase and other companies in the space?  Maybe...


Sure, but Gavin is not the "be all end all", and developer consensus (even independent of Blockstream) is clearly around Core's proposal.  At this point, I think that's an undisputed fact. 


I don't think anyone is relying on Lightning Network,  but it seems reasonable to at least *try it* first, no?  LN is not a replacement for scaling the blocksize up to infinity.  If it works (and we should all be hoping it does) it will enable *much* lower transaction fees and new micropayment use cases that would *never* be possible with Bitcoin Classic, even with a 100MB blocksize today.  


I'm generally with you man, I just don't think it's a dire situation now.  I made a transaction yesterday with 0.0001 fee (like 4 cents).  Is that unreasonable?  If it is, we can't wait one month for SegWit and the suite of improvements that will bring?
It's true that we had a "fee event" but, if anything, that forced Bitcoin wallet providers to update their software (with floating or otherwise adjustable fees) as they should have done already. Unless I'm very mistaken, we don't have real overwhelming demand right now, otherwise we'd have either a backlog or skyrocketing transaction fees.

Most important thing IMO to get across is the *lack of risk* if they sign up through BitPay, Coinbase, etc.  People are motivated by perceived risks and costs more than by the perceived benefits that some product (or technology) will bring to them.  
There's an opportunity cost in the time to set it up, I suppose, but companies like BitPay have built technology to make the setup process pretty simple and efficient.

Taking something that clearly *didn't* have consensus, then using disingenuous techniques like Classic node "launching services" to attempt to further influence perception and public opinion (and hurt the price) is certainly contentious.  The Classic node bubble has also now "popped"... not that Classic node count really meant anything to begin with.
Classic never got the support of the majority of users, developers, miners, etc.  They didn't get the support because, whether you agreed or not, the majority of the "investors" (Bitcoin hodlers) didn't support their proposal.  What do investors in a Blue Chip stock do if the CEO or Board of Directors is screwing things up?  They sell, demonstrating their disapproval by walking away and taking their investment with them.  They vote with their money, and so too do Bitcoin "investors" (hodlers).  
Actually, not only did they not get the support, but it *wasn't even close*.  And I would argue there was never a real serious threat of the contentious hard fork succeeding (which is a great sign for Bitcoin).
Onward and upward!

I've been sending w/ a .0001 fee for last ~week, no issues.
Most of us "hodlers" (investors) in Bitcoin would prefer long term appreciation (in price) over, say, $0.03 fees instead of $0.05 fees in the short term.  To any investor, that's a very marginal, short term benefit that comes at the cost of decentralization.  Bitcoin "proper" must remain the secure, foundation layer of the upcoming crypto-currency singularity.  ;)
@_date: 2016-01-30 03:01:03
you thought wrong.  The level of security that the Bitcoin network provides is not free of charge.  Solutions like lightning network address micro-transactions.  These solutions are far better engineered, and will likely allow for significantly lower transactions fees than are currently possible with Bitcoin (!).  They increase user privacy, increase the value of "bitcoins" (the layer-1 unit of account)...  Need I go on?
If every single layer-2 solution fails, then we can just bump up the block size to infinite so you can have "no fees" at the cost of Bitcoin's long term potential.

Sorry, let me change that.  I would say we aren't seeing some incredible flood of innovation, in the alt-coin space, that wasn't present in year's past.  Are there some innovative projects and ideas?  Sure.  Should Bitshares, for example, be pumping like it's new news or some sudden innovation?  Probably not...
This all goes without saying that most, if not all, successful alt-coins may eventually be implemented more efficiently as side-chains, leveraging the decentralization and mining power that Bitcoin already has.

What matters is what's objectively the best path forward, taking into account various risks, long term objectives, etc.  Bitcoin's minute scalability decisions (like whether segwit before hard fork) should not be determined by popular vote.  The fact that the community matters is self-evident, and not at all related to this technical determination.  I'm glad you pointed it out though.
All parties are working toward long term (decentralized) scalability and getting to that VISA network level throughput (and beyond).  Forget for a minute Hearn's vilification of Core developers and eventual vilification of the community (the very community you allude to).  The irony is that you're actually voting for Bitcoin "dictators" by voting for Bitcoin Classic.  How many people are involved with that again?  And when it was just Gavin and Hearn?
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:36:12


They receive payments... in bitcoins!  Not only that... time-locked, meaning they can't be released until some future date.  That's the opposite of conflict of interest, at least if you're referring to Blockstream.

I suspect like the Internet (there is really one "internet"), an "Internet of Money" would naturally, due to efficiencies and network effects, gravitate toward a single foundational P2P currency model.
It's worth noting - for new readers - that Bitcoin and Ethereum (just as an example) are very much apples and oranges.  They were designed... engineered... for different use cases.  As such, "ether", the Ethereum unit of account, will never be the "Internet of Money".  It is not as efficient as money, simply moving bits around, because it wasn't engineered for that purpose.  What you're seeing now in the Bitcoin space is the rising demand for usage of the network (space on the blockchain), and the exploration of scalability solutions specifically around scaling this one specific use case (moving bits around). 
I think we're in an altcoin bubble again currently.  We're not seeing any real innovation or value creation, but rather a series of pumps (Azure related news, often), dumps and essentially Bitcoin "hedging".

Not going to lie... this feels a little like ~mid/late 2013 (for those who were around).  
Who know though...  Bitcoin always defies expectations.  I personally sense that the recent price stability, particularly in face of attacks, both on the network and "perception" of Bitcoin (media going crazy about "death of Bitcoin" again), is a sign that we're at the beginning of another big, *big* move - that plays out over longer time periods and, like a honey badger, doesn't give a f$&amp;@ about short term influences, market manipulation, etc..  The deepest of pockets and forces I suspect will move this next wave.
This massive consolidating triangle would have collapsed already if it was going to.  We went through the FUD, the risk of Classic contentious hard fork (all but dead now), the "fee event"...  
If there existed a "FUD bubble", I think it's popped.  Now we await the great "halving"....
While the price creeps up, absorbing every failed dump like a monster truck steamrolling over sea shells near the shore...
2016 will be an *exciting* year.  I guarantee it.  ;)

One could argue that it demonstrates a certain volume of investment that's *interested*, even committed, to going into crypto-currencies (and certainly getting rich quick!).  Would it be unreasonable, or illogical, to conclude that this money is likely to dump back into Bitcoin if we bounce and alts (inflated already) crash?  You can not argue that alt-coins, typically trading against Bitcoin (eth/btc, xmr/btc, etc.), are not influenced by the price of Bitcoin.  Rises in Bitcoin push the Bitcoin market cap higher, as well as that of the alt-coins that trade mainly against Bitcoin.  For many alts that are already inflated, this is a nice proximate cause for a flash crash (in alts).
The "get rich quick" alt-coin crowd doesn't seem far off from the "panic buy" (which is based on a similar "going to miss out" type of mentality) crowd.

It wouldn't surprise me if Hearn initially pressured Gavin into Bitcoin XT, and/or attempted to falsely paint Blockstream in Gavin's mind as the "enemy", in an ironic undermining attempt of his own.  Hearn, who started *all* the drama, fits the least in the picture among the developers.  He certainly doesn't have the involvement, background, passion in the space of Beck or Maxwell.

It's concerning when you say "disagreement", when 50% of r/bitcoin clearly doesn't understand how Lightning Network works, what segwit *even is*, Blockstream's motives, etc.
If I were attempting to undermine Bitcoin (just saying), I'd probably open 50k reddit accounts and start "disagreeing" and causing trouble.  I would make an effort to make it appear that there's more support for "Classic" than perhaps there actually is, in the community.  
That supposed "disagreement" (on reddit) is remarkably far from that among experts.  In no other technical area of expertise do you ever see this.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:55:57
I would say it isn't how the majority of the community *anticipated* Bitcoin scalability, start the finish.  When you're talking about the communities "vision" though, I think it's important to be clear what that means.  I would argue that the real vision of Bitcoin was that of a digital, decentralized p2p currency.  That vision is intact, whether things like Lightning Network succeed or not.
A large part of the issue now is a lack of understanding of these technologies (LN, SegWit, etc.) and this is quite understandable...  These are complex topics to understand, and a typical redditer is more likely to extract his/her knowledge from other reddit comments than from white papers, etc.

Simply because enforcement costs *something* doesn't mean it must be expensive.  Bitcoin's decentralized architecture ensures it's enforcement costs remain relatively low (given the competition among miners).  
That isn't the point though, but, rather, a distraction.  The real question is...   what transactions, in the "real" world and digital world, are logical to enforce and which aren't?

For those of us who thought about Bitcoin consumer payments in terms of incentives, this isn't surprising.  There's little to no incentive for me, as a consumer, to use Bitcoin to pay for merchandise online.  It's a hassle, it costs money to obtain bitcoins (1%), and I get rewards with my Credit Card already.  I don't care if someone steals the information; I won't pay a dime out of pocket.  I'm not a cypherpunk, like 99.9999% of the population, so the privacy aspect is 
It's a novelty act today, and nothing more.  Businesses are the ones fucked by Credit Card payments, not the consumer.  Likewise, businesses have the most to gain by accepting Bitcoin, but users have little incentive to pay in that manner, at least today.  Without proper incentives, nothing is sustainable.

Ya, good questions/curiosities.  When I first got curious about Bitcoin, I just started browsing and reading as much information as I could, for several weeks, with a sort of detached curiosity.  It took me a long time to get comfortable with how it *actually* works, and the underlying value proposition..
Yes, you're right that you can buy coffee beans with bitcoins.  That's pretty trivial though, and remarkably uninteresting (from a technology perspective).  If you keep digging deeper, I think you'll realize that the Bitcoin protocol is really an incredible innovation in the field of computer science.  The technology enables, among other things, the transfer of *arbitrary value* anywhere in the world, at near zero cost, and without requiring trust or a third party.  Bitcoins lack of "backing" is, in fact, what makes it so innovative and unique.  Here are a few other things Bitcoin can do:
* Act as a traditional currency (think your coffee beans example) with almost zero fees, thanks to being decentralized.
* Act as an electronic store of value (think Gold), that can't be confiscated or "frozen" 
* Act as a sort of "programmable money" (automated crowd funding, divident payouts, trusts, escrows, etc.)
* Colored coins (you can google this)
I'd recommend watching this ( as the discussion and ideas shared are on point with the interest you raised.  With Bitcoin, I think you really need to keep an open mind, and toss aside your prior assumptions of what money is (and isn't), and how it can be used.  Bitcoin is not at all about purchasing coffee beans on the web, in the same way that the internet isn't about viewing static content on webpages - though 20 years ago you might have easily got this impression.  People with a vision for the technology will lead the way, and probably get very, very rich in the process.

Yes, my mistake.  Good point.  What I said was correct concerning a specific key of course, but DPR was clearly not storing 600k bitcoins on a single key.  He may have had 100 keys, so the wallet is all that's really relevant here.

Sure.  The wider we consider the time frame for the "average price" around the last bubble, the lower this average will be.  At some point (it seems the "weekly average"), we'll appear to be passing it.
I wouldn't overvalue comparing a "weekly average" to the current price.  Somewhat apples/oranges.  Not that I'm saying OP is doing that.  It is interesting perspective still imo.

There aren't 600k bitcoins, and that's the point.  That's just the *total* commission paid, in bitcoins, since early 2011.  DPR would have spent a reasonable portion of this over that period of several years to maintain the site among other things.  You have to also consider that for a large portion of this period, bitcoins were trading in single digits.  So, if in 2011 DPR needed to cash out some BTC to pay server costs, living expenses, "employees" (who were paid pretty well) and more, he would have had to cash out much more BTC than at today's exchange rate.
Maybe he has 150-200k bitcoin still?  Who knows.  600k is almost certainly an inflated figure though.

lol@ thinking you need 6 confirmations for any transaction not north of millions of dollars being moved.  Maybe if you were purchasing a nice estate with bitcoins, in which case you'd be comparing that to, say, a wire transfer or waiting for a check to clear.

Has it really grown?  The "market share" has increases, particularly comparing the 30day and 180day, but Mt. Gox volume has also fell off a cliff in comparison.  Bitstamp, on the other hand, is clearly growing in volume (folks going from Gox&gt;BitStamp).

I think it's because you're trying to send such a small amount that the protocol requires you pay that fee.  That discourages an infinite number of micro-transactions being sent through.  I believe, but don't quote me, if you were sending a bit more from coinbase you wouldn't have to pay that.
So after you do buy some btc, you could transfer some to your coinbase and then transfer it all off without paying that fee.

I think another "pro" is that it's just a new technology that could enable all sorts of interesting things, beyond simply storing wealth and spending bitcoins as more traditional currency.  Bitcoin is really an "API for programmable transactions", and it's difficult to even envision how the protocol might be leveraged in the future.
Not sure how you fit that in one point...   :)
It's like trying to list a "Pro" for the internet back in 1990.  You just couldn't even imagine how it would grow and we'd be using it today.  Would someone have listed "Google Maps" as a "Pro" for the internet 20 years ago?  Facebook (social networking)?

I purchased the max (50 btc) about a month ago when we dropped quickly to $90, and it wasn't cancelled.  By the time it arrived, we were back up at ~$125.  How do you explain that then?
What you're seeing is just confirmation bias.  Transactions are randomly marked as "high risk", from all I can tell.  Obviously, when the price has only been going up every day for a month, you're going to see way more people who were on the wrong side of a "high risk" marked order than not.
On top of that, people who actually saved money off a cancelled transaction do not come on Reddit to make a post.  So, again, we only see people posting about how they were intentionally ripped off.

We're in the *extremely* early stages of a rising technology.  Volatility, as people speculate about Bitcoin's future, is practically a mathematical certainty.  It shouldn't be surprising to anyone, nor a major concern.  It's a growing pain, and just a conditional that will exist in such a relatively small market.  As that market increases...
Gold is stable?  
At least Bitcoin has many more potential applications than gold, so it's likely to be *more stable* in the long run.  It's far beyond just a speculative store of value (like 85+% of gold's value).

Coinbase provides a good service though.  If they're getting scammed often enough over these "instant purchases", which is what I suspect, I don't blame them for taking extra precautions.  They charge only 1% (~$13) on a 10 bitcoin "instant purchase".  It doesn't take too many party poppers making off with $1300 worth of bitcoin due to [knowingly having] insufficient funds in their bank account, etc, before Coinbase is getting killed on these transactions.  "Instant purchases", in this regard, are a very risky game.  Perhaps in the future they'll continue to offer it, but for a higher fee percentage.

It's way late to make a killer profit mining.  You'll probably break even, or maybe lose a little from what I hear (compared to just buying bitcoin at market).  By all means, though, if you want to mine then mine.  Mining supports the community and decentralization, so you're being a big help to bitcoin by being a casual miner.

Speculators play an important role in markets.  How else would Bitcoin be brought to the center of attention and gain critical mass as a technology?  No one would be paying attention to it now, if it were still $0.01/bitcoin.
Buying Bitcoin early is direct investment in the future of that technology.  The simple fact that Bitcoin is largely speculated on today, ~ four years after it's creation, says nothing about it's inherent value, or lack there of, as a disruptive technology.

Note that this "one hour" figure you've been told is probably taken from how long it takes, on average, for a transaction to have 6 confirmations.  There's nothing special or magical about 6 confirmations.  It's sort of an arbitrary figure.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:00:38
That's not at all true.  Unless you're moving $5,000,000 in bitcoins (buying a large estate or something), you're being overly paranoid waiting for 6 confirmations.  For a small purchase at the grocery store, etc., it would be completely acceptable and reasonable to accept unconfirmed transactions.  There are a ton of other ways of mitigating this risk as well.

Bitcoin's potential value is far beyond simply a decentralized "banking system".  It's programmable money, something which has never existed before.  People tend to focus in on the spending and saving aspects, because they can relate to these with their traditional fiat.  Bitcoin, though, introduces all sorts of interesting possibilities in crowd funding, programmable escrows, wills, dividend payouts, etc.
It's like if you looked at a computer several decades ago, and someone said "look.. someone sent me 'Hello World'" from his computer.  It's the internet!"  Could you have envisioned stuff like Google Maps, Facebook, texting, etc., then?  Only if you had *one hell of an imagination*...

Here's some simple statistics for your dad, where you could both be right.  Let's say that you estimate the value of a bitcoin at $5,000 if "world economies" don't shut it down, whatever that means.  If you think this is only 10% likely, then the "expected value" (EV) of a bitcoin is $500.  This is 1/10th (10%) of $5,000.  Bitcoin is currently ~$200, so you should buy, in this example, as the EV is greater than the current market price.
Thus, your dad hasn't really given a convincing argument for not investing yet.
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:36:49
The price has jumped around wildly by nature.  The market is orders of magnitude smaller than the markets for fiat, and there's significant slippage with lack of volume.  As the market grows, as with any market, liquidity will grow.
"Settle" is subjective.  As the market grows, the variance will decrease.  In the long term, the exchange rate will appreciate significantly on it's own merits.  Who'd take issue with that?

Bitcoin has technically nothing to do with TOR.  You just need to go on an exchange, like BitStamp (or use Coinbase in the USA) and purchase bitcoins like you would on any currency exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:05:02
Bitcoin is valued as a protocol, though, and the actual utility of that protocol.  Gold is just used as a means of long term wealth storage, so it doesn't matter as much that you don't have the physical gold in your possession.  You don't require it's intrinsic utility like you would with bitcoin.
If we're just trading contracts that say "you have bitcoin", it's not the same because you aren't able to leverage the actual technology underlying bitcoin.  You've just got a piece of paper (might as well have a dollar bill).
Does that make any sense?  I'm just brainstorming here... not an economist.

Oh, I see.  I thought "we" were the customers.  They're asking their customers to send them free money so that they'll start accepting Bitcoin?  Seems pretty condescending and manipulative.
As a customer, you shouldn't have to "convince" a seller of anything.  You can simply take your business elsewhere.  Surely, someone else will accept Bitcoin without requiring that you first "convince them" by sending them free money.
Not only should no one send them anything, but they should probably, at the very least, call them out on this (or stop spending their hard earned income at these places).

We must be at the "delusion" state.  ;)
Dogecoin, while hilarious, will inevitably settle at $0.  It may happen next week, or next month, or it may continue on for six months.  The only reason to pay anything over $0/Dogecoin today would be in an attempt to turn a quick profit before that happens, but it will happen, once the joke passes (or another joke coin more "in the moment" comes along).  If you get seriously burned by Dogecoin, though, you only have yourself to blame.

It is, but when you're first purchasing bitcoins, say in the US with USD, you *have* to deal with legacy banking systems (because you're still dealing with USD).
People in the US don't have many options (still) because of retarded licensing requirements and more.  Coinbase is a great option for them though.

There's a bitcointalk thread somewhere that estimates, if I recall correctly, 400,000 known bitcoins that have been lost.  I may be off here, but that's just my memory.  Maybe someone else can comment.  If that's the case, the total number gone forever is probably over 500k.
There are a few people, including Satoshi (suspected), that have massive stashes as well that they likely won't be selling anytime soon.  So, for all intents and purposes, those are removed from the economy for the foreseeable future.  Some say Satoshi has ~1 million btc from early mining, assuming he/she/they never sold any.

Sure, I can agree on the investing vs gambling argument...
You can't call an investing "quite reckless" based purely on it's riskiness, though.  If you felt there was a positive long term EV, you would just invest a smaller percentage of your "investment roll" in it.  It's not an all or nothing type of thing.  EV determines whether you perhaps should invest or not.  Riskiness (variance) determines *how much*.

Do any of the thousands of other potential digital currencies have dramatically better attributes than bitcoin?  No.

Very professional, yes.  
To be critical though, I think you could have described the process of generating or "mining" bitcoins better.  To an outsider, you made it sound like a game in the way you described it... "solving puzzles".  It trivializes the whole thing, and makes it seem arbitrary and meaningless.  This takes away from the *why*, by focusing in on the meaningless details of *how* (meaningless to the observer).  I think it's critical to explain what the actual purpose of mining is (securing the network, confirming transactions, etc.) and why it's an innovation in computer science.  
If we describe "mining" by simply reducing it to "solving complex puzzles", I think we're doing Bitcoin a great disservice.

Investing in Bitcoin, by buying the currency, is investing in the whole ecosystem.  It creates incentive for start ups to enter the Bitcoin space, as the market cap grows, and also brings more awareness to Bitcoin.  So, in that regard, you're doing more than your fair share by simply buying and holding bitcoins (for now)!
That said, I do use Gyft when I can, and then just buy more bitcoin after buying a gift card.  So if you buy a $50 gift card with bitcoin on Gyft, you just go right on Coinbase and immediately buy your $50 worth of bitcoin back.  It's simple and supports the ecosystem even more.

Walmart will start accepting bitcoin when they have an economic incentive to do so.  At this moment, that incentive doesn't even remotely exist.  
It'll be interesting to see how bitcoin works it's way up to this "stage", which I think may ultimately be inevitable.  Bitcoin may very likely first explode in the payment services industry (think Western Union).  That alone would easily kick it to $1k+/bitcoin.  This would rely on the bitcoin protocol on the back end.  Users transferring money wouldn't even have to know what bitcoin is, what a private key is, etc.  They'd just transfer $1,000 to their family back in India and only pay 1%, verses 10% currently.  
Getting way off subject, but...  the point is bitcoin is a new technology/paradigm.  It's growth may come in an unexpected way - not necessarily from massive merchants accepting it for the sale of merchandise (which is what everyone just assumes off hand).

Just buy them with your fiat.
There aren't any "free", "easy" ways of obtaining that amount of bitcoin online.  It's no different than trying to get free USD online.  Both are valuable commodities that no one is just going to give away.  You'll just end up making $0.0000008/hr or 0.00000002 BTC/hr watching ads or something, and probably just end up wasting a ton of time.
Concerning GPU mining, you probably will ended up hiking your electricity bill up more than the 17 cents/day you were making.

The point was that there still exists incredible upswing potential, long term, and that there are strong reasons to believe the downswing potential is ultimately limited.

Yes, because Coinbase is synced with the exchange rate on BitStamp.  Every exchange has a slightly different exchange rate for bitcoin, and various factors weigh into this including:
Volume on exchange, rates charged (for deposits, trades, etc.), ease of withdrawal, etc.
Mt. Gox has been having some issues for several months with processing USD withdrawals.  They'd been search for a US banking partner, and once that's resolved withdrawals should continue.  Till then, the rate on Mt. Gox will be higher because USD on Mt. Gox is not the same as USD on BitStamp.

The problem is there's already been a bubble.  Several bubbles.  People holding bitcoin at this point have seen it all, and they're not about to panic sell fearing there's another bubble currently.
I think there will be more bubbles, and that this is inevitable, but it'll be at like $1k/$1.5k per bitcoin and not at $150/bitcoin.

These "high risk transaction" flaggings seem to be pretty random, and they may be required by the bank(s) that Coinbase works with.  I highly, highly doubt Coinbase is trying to screw anyone over if the price starts moving north after you purchase.  I did a sizable order ~ week ago around ~$90/btc (before it shot back up) and it wasn't flagged.  They could have easily screwed me over by flagging it as a "high risk transaction" if they really wanted to, as it was trading back at ~$115 like an hour later.  I just point this out to show a balanced perspective.

Since bitcoins are now worth a lot, you really can't "get into it" without coughing up some dough like everyone else.  You have to actually *be* a miner to collect newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees.  That's the whole incentive for people to donate their hardware to secure transactions.

It's an exchange just like any exchange.  Think of BitStamp sort of like eBay, where users of the exchange are either looking to sell fiat or bitcoins.  BitStamp simply facilitates the exchanging of fiat and bitcoin between these users.  BitStamp does not sell bitcoins, in the same way that eBay does not sell products...  it provides the platform, security, reputation, etc.
Here's the order book:
In the order book, you can see who's looking to buy/sell bitcoins for fiat, and at what price.  "Bids" are people looking to buy.  "Asks" are people looking to sell.  If you place a "market buy" order, the system will automatically remove USD from your account and move it to the sellers account (put simply at least) and move the paid for bitcoins from the sellers account to your account.

You can't "poof" them into existence, so they're either mined (by contributing power to the network) or purchased elsewhere.  In their case, they're probably purchased on BitStamp, since Coinbase uses the BitStamp API for their pricing I believe.

Well Coinbase is not an exchange, but they use an exchange on the back-end (Bitstamp I believe).  So, when you buy bitcoin on Coinbase you're indirectly purchasing it from someone that's selling it.

Even recognizing a potential bubble is not enough.  Where will the peak be?  $1200?  $2000?  $15,000?  How far will it drop?  Where will it stabilize? 
Hold for the long term, and then you could care less about short term overbuying and overselling.  Everyone who has held BTC for at least 1 year is "up".  Even the people who bought at the previous peak of $266 and held till today made a killing (at least by traditional investment standards).

* Appliance linked to the block chain (with unique address), that can act as an "agent" and purchase energy when needed on the open market.  Your refrigerator could negotiate with your furnace, with the right software.

If you claim you were "cheated", logic says you must believe they *intentionally* cancelled your order and falsely labelled it as high risk.  Is that what you believe with your tin foil hat?
Otherwise, I assume if the price had dropped after your purchase, and the system still marked the transaction as high risk, you would have returned the money you "cheated" them out of..   right?
If you were intelligent enough to send them an email, rather than coming on r/bitcoin and shout "fuck Coinbase", they probably would have apologized and honored it, as I know they've done in the past.  Maybe a lesson for next time OP.

What's the news?
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:10:52
A bitcoin, for all intensive purposes, is comprised of a public and private key.  The public key is analogous to your email address (which you give to other to send you bitcoins) and your private key is analogous to your password.  You'd never give out a private key.
Coinbase is an online wallet that's very user friendly and intuitive to use, in my experience.  They give you a public key that you can give others to send you bitcoin on Coinbase (click "Request Payment" or something like that to see it), but they don't give you any private keys.  This is sort of nice, because then you don't have to worry about losing a private key.  Coinbase takes care of the storage aspect for you.  You only have to worry about forgetting your Coinbase login information.  If you want to send or "spend" bitcoins from your Coinbase wallet, you just click the "Send Payment" button (or something like that).  
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:11:45
The irony, of course, is that Bitcoin may never have caught on without these sort of giveaway efforts to get others involved and intrigued.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:56:47
There's an option in one of Multibit's drop down menus (at the top) to "reset blockchain" or something.  Hit that and see if it fixes the problem.  Sometimes it just doesn't sync properly.
If it shows up on blockchain.info under the public address then it's definitely there.
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:04:31
Yes, they're coming from other users.  BitStamp facilitates the transaction.

@_date: 2013-08-31 14:07:17
One of the easiest ways would be to load some bitcoin on blockchain.info and download the mobile app as well.  Then you can just bring your smart phone with you and either copy/paste his public key into your phone or scan a QRCode (public key) off his phone to send to.  All you really need on you is your phone.
Also, I would check his bills beforehand (at least the first time you two transact).
Good luck.  Chat him up.  How'd he get interested in bitcoin, etc...  Having a long term customer who's willing to deal cash in hand, and likely at Mt Gox prices (I'm assuming) is always good for business.  :D
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:47:03
Also, yes...  people trying to withdraw fiat from Mt. Gox in the States will buy BTC and sell on BitStamp (probably Coinbase actually) to get their money out quick.  What other option would they have?  
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:55:27
I think it's easiest to start at the beginning.  Why enable "miners" and the "mining" of bitcoins to begin with?  First, miners are the individuals who confirm transactions and build the blockchain.  There would be no network without miners and, as mining is not free (think electricity costs, hardware, etc.), mining requires an incentive.  This incentive can be in the form of transaction fees paid to miners, or in the generation of a "reward" as part of the bitcoin protocol.  Such a reward also allows the protocol to introduce new bitcoins into the market at a predictable, controlled rate.
Why does difficulty increase?  Because the computing power on the network increases.  Increasing the difficulty helps maintain (at least theoretically) the desired 10 minutes between adding new blocks to the blockchain.
Why does computing power increase?  Because there is an incentive to mine bitcoins with specialty hardware, in the hope that you can "obtain" newly minted bitcoins at a lower cost than buying them at market.  
Will computing power continue to increase?  As long as there is an incentive to do so.  For example, if the exchange rate of bitcoin doubled tomorrow, there'd be more incentive to mine new bitcoins.  The hardware costs, electric costs, etc., would remain the same, but the reward, at least in USD terms, would be essentially doubled.  As a result, the protocol is essentially self correcting.  The Network maintains itself.

@_date: 2013-08-31 14:20:19
That's odd...  I don't think I've ever seen blockchain.info down.  
You just need to create a wallet there, and then they'll give you a public address.  You then go into bitcoin-qt and send $200 in funds or whatever to that public address on blockchain.info.
Then you just download the mobile app and sync it with your "wallet" on blockchain.info.  You can backup your blockchain wallet in a variety of ways, or you can just use it as an intermediate for transferring funds.
Of course, you can always just skip the middle step and send direct from your bitcoin-qt address to his public address.  Blockchain.info just has the slickest mobile app and other features that make it easy to transfer without lugging around your laptop.

I think the "network effect" is just one argument in Bitcoin's favor, relative to other alt-coins.  Assuming these other alt-coins don't offer a compelling advantage (define that how you wish), the network effect will ensure that Bitcoin is the leader.  
Let's say Bitcoin gets *really* big, and 10 years down the road a new alt-coin came into existence that did present a compelling advantage, as we'd define it above.  Since a lot of people would be heavily invested in Bitcoin, it would seem likely that the Bitcoin protocol would simply be modified to incorporate that advantage, if possible, rather than having everyone switch over to the new alt-coin.  This would be in the interest of all Bitcoin owners, assuming the alternative is that the new alt-coin would inevitably replace Bitcoin.
I'm not sure you can necessarily draw an analogy to companies like MySpace and Facebook.  There are a myriad of other factors that weigh in there that don't really apply to comparing protocols side by side: management styles, leadership, marketing, etc.

I think the volatility though is largely just a condition of the size of the market.  Therefore, it's sort of a "catch-22" if someone believes that volatility will be a hindrance to eventual adoption.  Any new form of "money" would, by definition, have to begin with a small market cap.  I think an initial period of high volatility in exchange rate would be a condition of that market, as it grows.
So, to even draw attention to the volatility of Bitcoin, as so many reporters do in a negative light, is to really only point out something self-evident and necessary for growth.  It's not intrinsic to the technology, as so many might suspect.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the public key is generated from the private key.  If that's the case, wouldn't it be extremely difficult to generate a desired public key, especially as the public/private key relationship, by the very nature of cryptography, is very well disguised?

Just for balance, I took quite a bit of BTC off Coinbase (to an address) 2 days ago and it was pretty much instant.  I've never had any delays in the past with getting BTC, or fiat for that matter, in/off Coinbase.

Said the people in January, waiting for Bitcoin to crash back to under $10/coin. They're still waiting.
Too steep compared to what?  If it were so readily apparent that Bitcoin was overvalued, it would have already corrected.  This idea in people's heads (always non-investors) that it's so trivial to spot when a price is "too steep" or "too high" is unfortunate.  You rarely, if ever, know more than all of the market players combined, unless you have undisclosed news that would move the market, which others are yet unaware of.

Coinbase fee is higher because it's comparing apples/oranges.  Coinbase isn't an exchange, in the traditional sense.  It's more a "wallet service" that uses BitStamp's exchange rate.  That 1% fee also includes depositing or withdrawing the cash from your bank account, if I recall correctly.

Usability will come in time, as it did with the internet.  Market inefficiencies just mean a better current price per bitcoin (ignoring short term spikes) for us "nerds" who can figure out the exchanges, storing bitcoins, etc., before it becomes trivially easy for the average Joe.
Once it does (ETF, Circle, etc.), the price will jump quick.  Coinbase, in my opinion, is one of the first companies that's simplified the process of obtaining bitcoin in the US (and also removing some of the fear).  This will continue.  Considering the Bitcoin market cap has jumped quite a bit recently, expect many more well-funded, fully compliant start ups to start jumping into the space.  There's more incentive now.
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:58:44
Poorly worded title.
Transaction fees will replace the current incentive system (block rewards).  It's really that simple.  Transaction fees will still be significantly less than legacy payment system fees because of competition in the marketplace (among miners).
You have the option to send a transaction fee currently with any bitcoin transfer, but it's not necessary since miners are mining anyway for the block reward.

The attachment with being a "Ponzi scheme", I suspect, is the fact that people who "get in early" have the capacity to make the most money (by buying the cheapest coins).  If this were all it took for something to be labelled a Ponzi scheme, then every start up investment opportunity must be a Ponzi scheme...
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme because it is an innovative technology that has real *value* (today, and, as we speculate, in the future).  Ponzi schemes have no real product or value offered, and thus they ultimately implode.  With Bitcoin, everyone wins.  Earlier adopters and speculators are rewarded more, of course, but they're the ones that drive the technology into the mainstream.  They should be rewarded (like early investors in an innovative start up).  If it weren't for early investors and speculators, new technology would never come to market.

It's a common misconception, in my opinion, that Bitcoin makes money laundering and tax avoidance so simple.  After all, there is a public ledger that is completely open for anyone's analysis.  You combat this with policy enforcement (KYC, anti-money laundering) at the points of entry/exit (exchanges, etc).  
The US govt also has to consider the implications of banning/"outlawing" a technology that's likely to be adopted elsewhere.  What if US bans and China let's the ecosystem flourish?  This becomes a dangerous ban-hammer game played on a global scale, and countries that do outlaw and restrict new technology are restricting innovation and sending it overseas.
In the end, you can't stop what's coming.  I'd question the success of a US ban anyway.  
EDIT:  Even if you calculate that a ban is more likely than not, that still doesn't make bitcoin a bad investment, from a purely statistical perspective.  Let's say I estimate if bitcoin is not banned that it will jump to a valuation of $2,000 in 5 years.  If I estimate a ban as an 80% likelihood, than my EV is 400$/bitcoin (still less than current value).  I should be buying.

You don't.  You buy bitcoins on an exchange.  No money in mining, everyone's hashing.
@_date: 2013-09-03 02:59:36
No, all you need is a public key, which is like your bank account number.  You can generate as many public/private key combinations as you'd like.  You can use a "wallet" for, among other things, generating new public/private keys.  A "wallet"can contain multiple public keys, just like your physical wallet might contain multiple debit cards..

Miners are like the backbone of the network.  They verify transactions occurring, and add them to the public ledger, called the "block chain", that everyone agrees upon.  The process of securing the network (via "mining") requires a lot of computing power these days.  This means expensive hardware and electricity costs.  These things aren't free, so miners are offered incentive in the form of newly minted bitcoins.  These bitcoins are released at a predictable rate, which will eventually max out at 21,000,000 total bitcoins.  At that point, the incentive to mine will be replaced by small transaction fees paid to "miners".
The process of "mining" allows bitcoins to slowly be introduced to the market over 100+ years, in a distributed fashion, and at a predictable rate.  It also provides that initial incentive for miners to power the network.

Your transactions are "confirmed" by miners, in a new block, which is then added to the block chain.  The block chain is a sort of public ledger, held by everyone.
Everyone agrees that the public address 1FxYgeh32K... has 50 BTC in it.  You, as the controller of that address, hold the private key, which allows you to transfer value in a secure and reliable way.  You could almost say that your bitcoins "exist" on the block chain, and that you hold the "password" for sending/spending them.
The Bitcoin protocol is truly a remarkable innovation in computer science.  Many VCs think it's the most significant technological achievement since TCP/IP (the Internet).  And this is where the fundamental misunderstanding begins..  
Bitcoin, as a new technology, takes significant effort to really understand and appreciate.  It is not about an arbitrary, digital token, as most believe.  It's not about getting rich quick, or "mining", hoarding, etc.  It's about the utility of this decentralized, distributed network, which enables the transfer of arbitrary value, almost instantaneously, at near zero cost, and without trust or a third party.
Most people don't understand how *exactly* TCP/IP works, but they know what the Internet is and could probably describe it to you (and how it benefits them).  20 years ago, they would have scratched their heads...  
They may have even thrown out words like "narco-terrorism", "pedophilia", etc, in condemnation of something they didn't understand (and unconsciously feared).  The same may some day happen with Bitcoin, but, on that note, we wait on the entrepreneurial community..

Bitcoin's lack of backing is partially what gives it such value.  Backing requires a backer, that must fulfill an obligation.  Bitcoin is valuable on it's own merit, and doesn't require a backer, or trusting any third party.
What "backs" any open source technology?  What "backs" internet protocol? 
It's a flaw in human perception to believe something must require "banking" to have *value*.  It's human nature to search for a "persona" or entity behind every action, even if one doesn't exist.

If you want to call investing "gambling", that's up to you.  It's really a matter of semantics.  Investors in any blue chip company are "gambling" on expected future earnings.  The value of stocks is determined by these future earnings (which don't exist *now*).
The value of something in the here and now is always driven by speculators, whether you're talking about Bitcoin, stock, etc.  This is certainly not unique to Bitcoin.  It's critical to how markets work.

No, I don't think so.  First, it wouldn't be a surprise that the block reward was coming up on ending.  It would probably be a gradual transition over to transaction fees, instead of some sudden panic from everyone realizing the block reward was ending the next day.  Keep in mind that the block reward would slowly be getting smaller and smaller as well, so it wouldn't be like it went from 25 BTC/block to zero overnight.
I think some people also suspect that the market conditions will change to more transactions happening "off the blockchain", so as to not incur fees.  For example, I think Coinbase transfers between users are currently managed by Coinbase and they aren't on the blockchain.  I could be wrong on this...

Well "miners" are distributed.  Anyone with the hardware (specialized ASIC hardware these days) can be a miner, so it will always be highly competitive and decentralized in nature.  Because of this, fees, even when they become applicable, will always be very low because of the heavy competition in the "mining market".  Every miner has to compete with every other miner for fees (or currently for newly minted bitcoins), in a completely free market.

It's controlled by the protocol, which everyone has agreed to use.  The code in the protocol says that a miner who discovers a block can "create" some set number of BTC and then send that to his wallet (which will be recorded in the block chain).
Bitcoin is digital, so the process of coins being "created" is just a matter of it being programmed into the protocol that everyone's using.  So, in essence, it's "restricted" or "controlled" by everyone else on the network who's observing this open process.

Yes, I agree.  You must demonstrate value first.  I prefer the simplicity of Erik Voorhees pitch to n00bies.  He mentions that bitcoins have value because:
(1) They're scarce
(2) They have specific attributes that make them an ideal medium of exchange and store of value.

**Direct quote from similar thread on Bitcointalk.org.  User is Hexadecibel:**
"When these sorts of posts pop up I like to point people to a blog post by Gavin, the lead developer of the core bitcoin software:






 &gt;Something like "ignore a longer chain orphaning the current best chain if the sum(priorities of transactions included in new chain) is much less than sum(priorities of transactions in the part of the current best chain that would be orphaned)" would mean a 51% attacker would have to have both lots of hashing power AND lots of old, high-priority bitcoins to keep up a transaction-denial-of-service attack. And they'd pretty quickly run out of old, high-priority bitcoins and would be forced to either include other people's transactions or have their chain rejected.
So not only is the price tag to attack the network ever increasing, there is also the fact that if 'X' organization spends the millions of dollars to attack bitcoin, they risk it merely being circumvented. Thats a lot of wasted money, a lot to answer for if you fail."

Coinbase allows you to link to your bank account to buy and sell bitcoin.  It's probably the easiest and most intuitive way of obtaining bitcoin in the US right now.  Go to the Buy/Sell tab and buy!
Otherwise, Bitstamp and Btc-e are good exchanges to buy bitcoin on.  Also localbitcoins (though not really a traditional exchange), in particular for in person buying and selling.

Maybe invest 1/2 now.  If the price dips, you can be happy feeling that "at least you didn't go all-in at a short term peak.  If the price keeps moving north (most likely imo), you can be happy feeling that "at least I invested some at a lower price, rather than waiting and praying for a dip".

I think this is incorrect.  Mt Gox price would fall, as it's users would rush to sell BTC at the still inflated price (driving it down).  Stamp user would rush to buy, so they could then sell on Gox at those same inflated prices.  Both exchanges would meet somewhere in between.  I imagine Gox would fall a bit more than Stamp would rise, as it's simpler to just sell on Gox for the quick profit, than to buy on Stamp and then sell on Gox (if that makes sense).  The latter involves an extra step.
When the storm settles, with all else remaining the same, you'd expect an overall uptick because Gox continuing USD withdrawals would be an overall positive for the market.

It's an absurd comparison, and really only draws attention to the proponent's lack of understanding of what Bitcoin really is.  Tulips lack utility.  Bitcoin has remarkable utility.  It's the world's first decentralized public ledger and contract network.  It requires no trust, or third party.
People that compare Bitcoin to "tulip-mania", it seems, must believe that Bitcoin either has no utility, or that it isn't scarce.  The scarcity should be obvious.  You'd really have to stretch your imagination to convince anyone that the network doesn't have utility (a network that, conveniently enough, only keeps record in one unit of value - bitcoins).

What's perhaps ironic though is that this online "black market" requires a number of ingredients to work, one of which is a currency like Bitcoin.  Another key ingredient: *The Internet*.  Will the Internet be getting the ban hammer?  Of course not.. but why?  Is it not an equally important ingredient in this puzzle?
It took a long time for the Internet to gain mainstream acceptance from skeptics.  Eventually, though, I think people tend to come to agreement that new technology is inherently apolitical, and neither "good" or "bad".  It's how it's used.  The same revelation will occur with Bitcoin, in my opinion.
Unfortunately people who don't understand new technology tend to fear it, and fight it.  This isn't a new phenomena, but technology that innovates and cuts cost has a long history of pushing itself into the mainstream.

I don't think we're in or nearing a bubble.  There doesn't seem to be much reason to support that.  If recent upticks were due to Mt. Gox liquidity issues, then we would see people driving the Mt. Gox rate up (more buyers than sellers), and then drive the BitStamp rate down (more sellers than buyers).  This has not been happening.
I think we're just seeing slow, steady "adoption", which is to say people putting money into bitcoin.  This isn't strictly the US... look at Chinese exchanges (big population), Germany, etc.
Caveat:  I am very far from any expert.

Furthermore, from a strategic perspective, what will the US gain long term by outlawing bitcoin?  What if it takes off over the next few decades and China holds a large portion of this new wealth?

However, today’s valuation is equally off the charts. Most people, when discussing bitcoin’s value, still seems to just look at its trading price when determining its value. As I estimated today, that’s not where bitcoin’s value comes from. It is a transactional currency. **As such, its value is – or can be estimated to – its market share of transactional currencies, multiplied by the size of that market (about 75 trillion US dollars).**"
Stopped reading here.
If something may be worth $100,000 in the future, it's value today, via speculation, is that future expected value multiplied by the likelihood of it occurring (say 1%), adjusted for the time value of money.
That's why we have free market exchanges to attempt to estimate that value, given limited knowledge.  Is there price manipulation?  Sure.  Is bitcoin orders of magnitude overvalued, given an accurate understanding of valuation?  Not if the above follows.

So everything that has utility or "intrinsic value" is a bubble?  Is internet protocol, an analogous technology, also a bubble?
Bitcoin is just an emerging technology that incorporates scarcity, a required attribute of money.  If it weren't for the scarcity associated with "bitcoins" (the unit of transfer on this network), I doubt anyone would be calling this decentralized payment network a "bubble".  This payment network addresses a generalizable problem, and it should be readily apparent that it has value.  It's by pure extension that "bitcoins" have utility and value.

There's a place on blockchain.info where you can enter a public key and observe transactions coming in and out.
When bitcoin is sent to your address, that transaction will be almost instantaneously noticed by other nodes on the network.  On average, it'll take 10 minutes before it's officially listed on the blockchain (a sort of public ledger), and thus have one "confirmation".  Six confirmations takes, on average, 60 minutes.
Do you need to wait for 6 confirmations face to face with someone to feel safe?  How about 10 confirmations?  In practice, I think you'll be more than fine waiting for just one.  You're standing next to the guy and know who he is, so what are the odds he's attempting some sort of double spend at that very moment?

My guess is that Brian hasn't really taken the time to understand "Bitcoin", the payment network, as opposed to "bitcoins", the unit of account on that network.  The innovation and utility, as Voorhees and others continually point out, is in the actual payment network.  It just happens that the sole unit of account on this new network is in the form of "bitcoins".
This seems a common misconception, as people in the field of finance attempt to grasp what is really, at it's core, an innovation in the field of computer science.  It shouldn't be surprising when they fumble to understand the utility, but I think they will, in time.

They just use an algorithm to determine "high risk" transactions.  Sometimes it's wrong.  When it's wrong, and the value of bitcoin has gone down since the purchase date, obviously we don't hear anything on Reddit.  These people got lucky that their order was canceled, as it actually saved them money.  When the algorithm is wrong and the value of bitcoin has gone up since the purchase time, everyone decides to start a new post on Reddit.  i.e. "Coinbase is trying to rip me off", etc.

Mining bitcoin today is extremely difficult and inefficient with standard hardware.  You'd need to purchase dedicated ASIC hardware, which will cost you $1,000's of dollars, and you'll be lucky if you recover your upfront costs in the end.
Think of it as analogous to gold.  If you wanted gold today, for hobby or whatever, you'd just go exchange for it with fiat.  You wouldn't try mining it in your backyard, because it's just not that easy.  No such thing as easy money.

Sure, it's possible, in which case we'll all be better off.  The consensus, today, seems to be that Bitcoin is pretty damn good money though.. as a technology.  If it were possible for a protocol with dramatically better attributes to come along, it would seem likely that people would indicate significant weaknesses in the underlying Bitcoin protocol (upon which improvements could be made).  I don't think we've seen this to date.

@_date: 2013-12-28 21:21:05
I'm not sure how that would be possible, because the dollars would have to be held somewhere.  The digital "dollars", which would be transferable over the protocol, would need to be "backed" by real dollars somewhere.  If they weren't, then they'd quickly create a "fork" with the value of real world dollars, and take on a value dictated by supply and demand on the network (as they do now).  
I could be wrong of course..  It seems, at least at first glance, that a new technology like this requires a unit of account that exists solely within the protocol.

As with gold, there are two ways of obtaining it.  
(1) Mining
(2) Purchasing from someone else who already has it (via an exchange).
Mining is very specialized today, so an exchange would be, by far, your best and most cost effective option.  If you're in the US, Coinbase is a great route.  Also, Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:43:02
The rabbit hole is deep.  See you in a few weeks.
On a more serious note, the only "efficient" miners today are using ASICs.  You wouldn't make much more than pennies a day by infecting millions of standard computers with mining software.  CPUs and GPUs are many orders of magnitude less efficient at mining bitcoin, and they'll become less and less efficient as the difficulty increases.  The difficulty increases as more ASICs flood the market...  ASICs specifically designed for mining bitcoins.
There are threats to bitcoin, but most of them are regulatory and due to uncertainty.  Viruses like this are certainly not one of them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:58:15
I think you're being pretty naive if you think most gamblers are gambling because they don't understand basic statistics (with the implication being that they think they're a long term winner).  Gamblers are generally not retarded.  They know the house wins...   many of them unconsciously *want* to fuck up.
For many, there is also entertainment value to gambling that is too often dismissed.  It's logically consistent to believe that someone could enjoy gambling, knowing that they'll ultimately lose money if they continue indefinitely, because they find it an alternative form of entertainment.  No different than dumping loads of quarters into an arcade machine (though often more costly).

The best way, at this point in time, is to acquire and accumulate bitcoin.  This supports the entire ecosystem, by increasing the market cap and creating more incentive for businesses to enter the space.  This is no different than when the cost of oil is driven up.  It creates more incentive for the drilling of oil.
Increasing the market cap also increases media coverage and attention from the public.

This.  IMO, the actual "value" of bitcoin is what you can get for it now in USD.  Not what you can maybe get in a month in USD (think Mt. Gox's current situation).  This is why Mt. Gox has the highest USD/XBT exchange rate.  You can sell your bitcoin for much more there currently, but you're picking up some risk and you won't see any USD you can actually spend for weeks or even months.

@_date: 2013-10-04 00:24:17
Make it clear that Bitcoin is an internet-based protocol, that enables "programmable money".  It has specific attributes that make it a great medium of exchange, and that's why it has great potential as a currency and store of value.  Maybe give a few examples, such as the potential in the remittance industry, or micro-payments.
When SilkRoad is inevitably brought up, point out that SR was a dot on the drug "map", and that the far, far majority of illegal transactions are conducted with yours truly - the US dollar.  Point out that, while there was a "flash crash", the price quickly stabilized at only a few dollars down following the news.  This demonstrates the market's confidence in bitcoin as a speculative investment w/ remarkable potential as "the people's currency".
Be professional.  Don't speak in "scary" political speak ("revolution", "new age", libertarian speak, etc.).  Also, use analogies to the rise of TCP/IP wherever possible, as people can relate to this.

Valuation today is determined by the expected future valuation multiplied by the estimated likelihood of that occurring.  That amount is then adjusted to take into consideration the time value of money.
For example, let's say I estimate Bitcoin's potential value, in a bullish scenario, as $50k/bitcoin.  Let's say that I assign this a 10% likelihood, and assume that 90% of the time the value will go to zero.  If I estimated that this bullish scenario would take 20 years, then my EV (in 20 years) is $5k/bitcoin.  This is trivial to calculate...  10% of $50,000.  Now plug in APR and determine the value today (maybe $4k/bitcoin in this example).
In the above example, I've deduced a value of Bitcoin today, based on a future expectation and not it's current utility.  Note that I just chose values at random for this example.

@_date: 2013-11-07 05:48:37
I only post to provide fair balance...  It's important to hear every side of a story.
I purchased 50 btc (the limit) via Coinbase during the "Silk Road crash", at $90/btc.  I'm "Level 2" as well.  It quickly recovered to ~$115 within hours.  Coinbase didn't cancel my order or mark it as "high risk", even though they could have and made a few thousand as a result.  By the time it arrived in my account (a week later), we were back in the $120s or $130s.
You're putting on your tin foil hat if you think Coinbase, a VC-backed company, is intentionally hustling you out of money when the price moves up after you purchase.  My guess is their banking partner may require these "high risk" determination algorithms in order to bank with them.  From an outsider's perspective, they seem to be pretty random..  Obviously, though, people don't seem to come complaining on Reddit when they purchased bitcoin via Coinbase, the price fell, and then their order got cancelled for being "high risk".  I'll let you ponder why..  They call this confirmation bias.
I'm not saying you didn't get randomly fcked, but you're being pretty naive to think this is some consorted effort by Coinbase.  No rational (even selfish) human being would conduct business in this manner.  It's not in their long term interest.

I think there are many of us, including myself, who've literally never had any problem using Coinbase.  I've made multiple purchases, withdrawals, both big and small.  I've also moved in/out of Coinbase many times, with no delay.  Coinbase for me has been *great*.
Those who've had no issue with Coinbase (the far majority) are simply not as outspoken as the pedants who pick on every fine detail.  Right now, at least for Americans, it's like you're in a desert, spot a water well, and then complain that the quality of the water isn't up to your local fresh market standards.  Do you understand the current state of the ecosystem?  Coinbase is a blessing in comparison to most alternatives.
As far as "the wait" on deposits, this is because people try to screw over Coinbase and reverse the transaction after they've received Bitcoin and then move it off the site.  Does Coinbase not have a right to protect themselves from scammers, who would otherwise destroy the business model?  The problem is the banks, not Coinbase.

Ya, I guess you could say there's an unlimited number of potential miners.  Anyone can join in as a miner, though it would probably only be profitable for some to do so (with specialized hardware).  For example, you could download the Bitcoin client and mine on your PC if you wanted, but it would be remarkably inefficient and costly unless you had the right hardware (negative EV).
