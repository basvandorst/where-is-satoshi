I'd say these are the same people who store their Bitcoin on an exchange already. It's already inconvenient to secure your private keys and I'm sure a huge amount of Bitcoin hodlers have never even installed a wallet. 
So, yes it's a problem of centralization but I'd argue that it already exists. LN should/will be integrated into wallets and abstracted. 
We need secure services to store private keys, GUI's that are simple to use and lightweight nodes to solve the problems you mentioned. LN might make it worse, but it's not the root of these problems in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:36:29
Even if that happens, you don't have to trust the "exchange hub". 
You don't store your bitcoin on there, you don't have to provide any personal information. If the exchange is a dick about anything you just close your channel and open it with someone else. 
Also I'm pretty sure users of an exchange would not be happy if they lock deposits into a channel. Any exchange with at least some reputation will not do this.
Don't talk about trust if the whole idea of LN is to be trustless. What you're talking about is network topology.
Edit: Hubs would be more comparable to internet provides, with the small difference that you can choose every provider in the whole world - Without providing any personal information.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:30:37
These are good points. Here are my thoughts on them:


That's true but i'd say it's not a huge problem. I think it's clear that a channel is not a way to store BTC. LN is more like a hot wallet that is online anyway. If i carry around a physical wallet, i can loose it or it can be stolen. As long as you're aware of the risks, it's not much of a difference.


Just like every Bitcoin node. DDOS is mostly targeted on someone specific and a problem that's known to other services. I don't think this should be a problem, at least not a permanent, otherwise the rest of the internet would have the same.


I'm kinda confused about routing. There is so much information that's varying from "not solved at all" to "it somehow works". It seems to work already, otherwise these testnet "stores" would not work, right? Is it slow, bad at scaling, centralized or just doesn't work? I'd really like to see a good article about the current implementation.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:54:33
Having bigger or faster blocks doesn't mean they scale better, they just choose to compromise decentralization with more transactions. Every blockchain scales pretty much the same. There is a difference between typical blockchain topology (Bitcoin / Litecoin ...) and Directed acyclic graphs (IOTA.. ). But DAG's also didn't prove yet that they solved scalability.
Bitcoin scales just the same as every other blockchain, they just choose to not do it and maybe you should take some time and think about why they do that.

I really don't see a problem if there are more "centralized" nodes in lightning. As long as the base layer is properly decentralized and there is no magic money printing happening, I'm fine with it. Everyone seems to be fine giving their bitcoin to centralized exchanges, so why not use "centralized" nodes as payment channels. Even better i don't have to provide an identification and i can just switch node if government doesn't like the one I'm using.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:13:08
Maybe not something we want to hear, but i think it's actually good we have this problem right now.
We can see that blockchain tech does not really scale that good. We have the option to just double the blocksize everytime we hit capacity, but what do we get out of this? We'll end at a point where it's too late and decentralization is gone. There is no going back from that and we don't know where it is.
If we restrict it on purpose and create a situation as we have it right now, we push development in the right direction. Do you want to solve scaling when it's too late? It's way better if it's solved right now. Most problems tend to be solved if they are urgent and people cry like their life depends on it.
This way we get investors to support development in this area. Otherwise they would just create fancy features and ignore scaling until it's too late.
Give Bitcoin a break, it's a project that's unproven and is still in early development. Just because everyone wants to use it right now and mainstream should be reality, doesn't mean Bitcoin is ready for it.
Chill out and use a solution that works for you, if you REALLY want to buy your coffee with cryptos. There are a lot of smart people working on solutions, support them and your problem will be solved sooner or later.

I love how the referenced post is bragging about 1mil created cash wallets. Everyone gets a damn cash wallet automatically if he installs the bitcoin(.)com wallet even if he just uses it for BTC. 
I wonder how many noobs go to bitcoin(.)com, see the BITCOIN WALLET and download it as their first wallet. I mean it's called bitcoin(.)com right?.. it has to be the correct wallet to store BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:34
Well i agree on that. I just tried to say that i don't have a problem with this solution. It's not the same as giving your keys to a centralized exchange, they are still yours. If LN nodes tend to centralize, we can still work for a better solution. If bitcoin centralizes there is not really a way back.

I'd say it's the same as always. Both views have their own problems and maybe a little bit of both would be the best way?
I like u/Hanspanzer's answer: "(lefties) don't believe in the freedom to let others suffer for personal gains". To prevent this you need something like a central organ that regulates some things.
I don't see a problem with having a central authority. I'm pretty sure it's needed as otherwise someone will take advantage of people that need our help. Since most of us are taking care for them-self first (which is ok), people that need our help will be left behind. 
(Mostly) the problem is not the system, it's the people executing this system. There are people using this system for personal gain and that's where we see problems.
I'm sure Bitcoin and maybe other decentralized systems, could help prevent some of this manipulation and we should take advantage of that.
These complete left/right wing approaches will never work, as you'll always have enough people with an opposite view against you. Progress is always a question of finding a workable middle ground.

And how is Bitcoin gonna generate wealth and lift anyone out of poverty? Is it some magic money that takes from the rich and distributes itself equally to the poor? Please show me where that's written in the protocol.
Just because it made some early investors rich doesn't mean it will change anything. Maybe it will redistribute some of the wealth, but it will not change the gap between rich and poor.

Can someone explain/guess why they're pausing BTC withdraw during the upgrade? Fiat withdraw is still possible as i understand it, so everyone laundering money will withdraw and go somewhere else.. Is it a technical reason?

That comparison at 4:26 alone is enough for me to not listen to him. Everyone with a simple understanding of graphs can see how misleading this is.

Ok that makes sense thank you! But if it is a cumulative chart, wouldn't that mean that some or several people have to buy all the previous bitcoin values too, to raise the price to 965.30?  
Like 1.00 + 0.07 + 0.08 + 0.21 + 12.14 + 0.82 + 14.84 in my example.
Otherwise someone could raise the price to 965.28 by buying 0.82 bitcoins, or am i wrong here?

Does this also mean we have less transactions? I know transaction count != volume, but with less volume we could expect less transactions i guess.

@_date: 2017-08-22 16:31:25
I don't even know where to start but let me try..  
1. Yes BCH is 150GB because it forked off BTC, that doesn't give BCH any more value over LTC, it's just old BTC transactions. Why does it even matter...?  
2. Median transaction value based on what? Current pump? BCH median transaction value was below 600 few day ago. Don't compare two values that are so volatile and pick some spots you like.  
3. $665 is 15x of LTC and 3000x Ripple. Why don't you buy Ripple? Because there are more coin like i said before.   
4. Marketcap is a useless measure, but let me repeat my little experiment for clarification: I create a new chain and mine 1mil coins. I sell 1 coin for 10$. My chain now has a marketcap of 10mil dollar. Can you see the problem with Marketcap?

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:12:55
Yes that is correct, so why would you use average, it's useless in this context.  Anyway, since we are on topic i suggest we give it a go and see what we can read from median transaction value:  
I'll use [this]( from  as our data. We can see a comparison of LTC vs. BTC vs. BCH median transaction value per day. If we take the most current datapoints from yesterday this would be   
BTC: 722$  
BCH: 1716$  
LTC: 666$ (lol)  
Let's also take the all time high of each currency  
BTC: 726$ - 14 Aug 2017  
BCH: 2288$ - 20 Aug 2017  
LTC: 1546$ - 4 Dec 2015  
What can we get from this data?  
1. BCH has the highest med. transaction value yesterday.
2. BCH has the highest all time high
So what could this mean in comparison to BTC?
* Alot of BCH transactions have a huge value
* Alot of BTC transactions have a low value
If we look at yesterday, BCH had almost half the transaction count of BTC. So that means all of these transactions must have been huge to overtake BTC by almost 1000$.  
So what is my conclusion here: Either someone with a lot of money tries to pump BCH or BTC has a lot of low value transaction (some would say spam). Or maybe both?

I'm almost certain this is by design. The 2x fork was never supposed to happen. This was just a farce to make bcash relevant. I would not be surprised if all of this was planned.  
Bcash fork, 2x drama, abandon 2x, pump bcash... profit? I mean, it worked out perfectly and probably made them a lot of money. A mined 2x block would just be an uncertainty in this strategy, so why not just add some code (that no one reviews anyway) to make sure no 2x block is ever mined.  
I'm not sure yet if bcash is just their tool to get more cheap bitcoin, or if it's really there to be relevant.

@_date: 2017-09-15 15:02:36
I mean it's kinda obvious by now. It's not the first time 'China bans bitcoin'.
China is heavily invested in Bitcoin and they won't ban anything soon. They regulate the things they can and create fud while doing it to make some profit. As long as nothing happens to the Bitcoin Protocol we'll always go back up again.

There was a commit on btc1-0.15 branch 8 days ago. Looks like they just merged 0.15 from core. Active development as you can see /s.

I asked the support about this 2 weeks ago. Here is the answer: 


Kraken does not have a formal position regarding this matter at this time, but you can subscribe to our blog via e-mail at  where announcements are periodically made -- additionally, Kraken clients receive e-mail announcements at times when developments of import merit an e-mail going out.
While we are always open to adding new digital assets to our exchange, we do not generally confirm in advance which ones will be listed. The best way to get up-to-the-minute details regarding which assets are being listed on Kraken is to read our email newsletters and to follow us on social media.
Thank you again for contacting us regarding this matter. We benefit from concepts submitted from the diverse ecosystem that helps to transform the new economy.

I also have to add: Estimating something this big is really really really hard. Almost every developer will tell you "I can try but i'm almost 100% certain that it will be totally wrong", and most of the time it will be totally wrong.
Sure you can break everything down and make a rough guess. Problem is: Making a rough guess and adding a good x2 results in: "whaaaat... why does it take sooo long? This is shit, i can't wait so long". Estimate too low and everyone hates you because you didn't deliver.
They don't own anyone anything and Stark said "it will be a continuous delivery and not a single release". They do the right thing by just not setting a release date.

This dip is just another joke and a good time to buy. First, who cares what JP Morgen said? These are just some articles to multiply the price drop, and they appeared just at the right time. Second: did someone from china (like cnledger) actually confirm the ban yet? No! It's just speculation from unknown sources as of now. I see only US/EU exchanges leading the drop while the big china exchanges just seem to follow.  
This gif will turn around 180° soon.

Thank you for the answer! Can you explain how someone would use the opt-in replay protection?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:31:53
I'd say most of them are just uninformed people talking about something they never used or worked with. 
Have a look at how much stuff was discussed about Segwit that was wrong to begin with (on both subs). People like to post, stuff but people don't like to learn stuff.

I'd say we get the most adoption when more exchanges start using segwit. Let's be honest, the nr.1 usecase of Bitcoin is exchange -&gt; wallet or wallet -&gt; exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:51:14
Well marketcap is still a bad indicator of anything. Fork bitcoin, sell one of your new coins for the same price and you have the same marketcap. A lot of bch is still frozen in wallets that don't support bch or held by people that just don't care. A marketcap that grows from the start and is not just a copy, is a better indicator but still bad (look at ripple) for example.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:51:44
Thank you for the link! This pretty much solves my concern.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:43:50
So the best strategy is to support Bitcoin in the upcoming fork, because that will save Bcash from s2x and kill Bitcoin. Gotcha, support Bitcoin to kill Bitcoin, sounds like a great plan if you ask me... /s
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:27:31
I'd say someone just made this block, to show that bigger blocks are possible. Not that we already knew this and was shown when litecoin activated segwit, but hey some people are hard to convince. Is it spam? Uuuh maybe, but does it matter?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:09:49
Yeah, i would question my boss if he threatens me with something like this. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:15:47
guess they got bored
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:06:02
I don't get their strategy. "We want bitcoin! No wait we want bcash or was it unlimited? Wait wait wait, we now support s2x because big blocks!!! No, erm wait... we don't support s2x because bcash is the real Bitcoin. Maybe tomorrow we support unlimited because that was a GREAT idea". I'm amazed they are still in business.

This is stupid. If the guys with power to change things start betting a lot of money, the situation will just get worse.

See the [Big O notation]( for more information.  
O(n) means that an algorithm/function scales linear while O(n^2 ) scales exponentially.  
Easiest way is to think of it in loops.  
O(n): You have a loop, where "x" tells you how many times the loop will run. If you increase "x", the loop scales linear as in "everything in this loop is executed x times".  
For example: if x=1 the loop is executed 1 time. If x=10 the loop is executed 10 times.
O(n^2): Think of a nested loop where "x" is the outer loop and "y" is the inner loop. If you increase "y" the inner loop scales linear, but if you increase "x", the inner loop now scales exponentially. 
For example: if x=1 and y=10, the inner loop is executed 10 times. If x=10 and y=10, the inner loop is executed 100 times.
Functions with nested loops are mostly O(n^2 ).
Please correct me if i'm wrong, it's some time ago I've used this.

You realize that the one timeline is 35y while the other is not even 1? If you try hard enough you'll find a recemblance in everything.

No one is king! Bitcoin is supposed to be a balance of user needs, miner greed and economic activity. There is no king in bitcoin and that is why it works!
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:14:07
But they could learn from our mistakes. Could...
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:48:10
Can i split my coins by sending my BTC to a new address that i own (after the fork)?
Then when i send BTC, there is no B2X to replay on this new address.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:42:46
I don't agree that people were driven away because of high fees. In December the fees were as high as it gets and everyone was happy trading. People were creating transactions because of the hype and now as the hype is over, we are back to normal. People didn't leave because of fees, they did because the price was going down.  
Actually I'd say there was never much activity on the blockchain except trading/speculation. For BTC to be useful as a payment system it has to be better than the current one. People are lazy: convenience over security. That's why everyone is still using fiat for payments.

Of course he does, he invested in it....

uuuh with that many nodes i don't think the "market" has chosen Btc1, just some miners did.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:22:44
I think you have the wrong idea of what ether is used for. Of course most traditional web services don't need to be decentralized. But like bitcoin tries to replace banks, think about usecases where you have to rely on a third party to achive something. Research some tokens like gnosis, iconomy, melon and others and see what third parties they try to replace.

"last minute tweaks"... that sounds more like "no guys we don't have time for testing!! just fix the damn bugs and then commit the code."
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:27:55
Did the same few weeks ago. Feels good!
