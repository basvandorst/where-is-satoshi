Already resilient. There's over thousands of nodes in almost every country in every continent. The nodes are able to reach consensus on the chain by following the chain with the most work done as detailed in PoW.

When you deposit money to Coinbase your funds are on hold until your Bank successful transfers the funds to the Bank Coinbase uses.
These bank to bank transfers can take 3-5 business days or longer.
So it makes sense for your funds to be locked from withdrawal in order for coinbase to ensure that they actually received the money.
However when depositing crypto like Bitcoin, it only requires a certain number of confirmations, so if the mempool is low you can have the deposit successfully complete in under an hour (much faster than banks)

You could refund the extra Bitcoin back to the sending address. But that's risky because the customer may not have access to the private key of that address (ex: using an exchange to pay).

I'm sure a government can stop or sieze the infrastructure around Bitcoin such as exchanges, merchants using Bitcoin, basically any local service that exists physically.
But a government can't stop the Bitcoin network so long there is computers running the nodes. If you want to stop Bitcoin itself, you have to sieze all the thousands of computers around the globe that run the software.
This is what makes Bitcoin censorship resistant. It will run all on its own and there is nothing any individual or group can do about it.

I know particularly in the US, crypto to fiat exchanges require a money transmission license which iirc requires you to collect KYC info. This is how traders operate in local bitcoins.

Again Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's a common misconception.
Every transaction is tracked publicly on a ledger. Since KYC laws are very common nowadays it doesn't take much for legal authorities to track Bitcoin addresses and tie them to faces.
There are other crypto currencies that focus on privacy specifically like Monero and Zcash that would be more suitable for these things.
And to your previous post 
Volatility of the market is a big factor. You are less incentivized to hold something that can go up or down in double percentage points within hours.
Bitcoin has been volatile from day 1, yet this hasn't gotten in the way of adoption and further development.
If or when Bitcoin's volume grows, the volatility will decrease with it as it would require more money to make a dent in the price.
You still really haven't answered my main point.
Smart contracts and p2p payments literally replace the role of banks. At what point do you really need a middle man when it can be replaced by cryptography?

If you validate your own transaction and never broadcast it. And you happen to be a miner and find the next block, I suppose you can do it that way. But this scenerio is basically impossible since mining requires pools nowadays.
You do need to broadcast your transaction to other nodes, and miners that find the next upcoming blocks will eventually include your transaction, and then it will permanently get saved on the ledger.
So basically, If you never broadcast it for others to verify, they won't be aware of your transaction so it won't ever be included in the next block unless you find the next block yourself.
Edit: I forgot to mention that it is in your best interest to broadcast your transaction to as many nodes as possible for higher chance of a miner confirmation.

nodes connect to about 12 other nodes more or less. My node is currently connected to 100 other nodes for instance. Let's just use 12 in this example.
When you are sending a transaction, you broadcast it to your connected nodes. Those nodes broadcasts it to their connected 12 nodes. And those nodes broadcast to 12 other nodes, and so on until all Nodes in the entire world have your transaction on hand.
Whenever a node receives a transaction, it validates it. If it is valid, then it chooses to broadcast to it's own connected nodes. If it keeps receiving invalid transactions from a potential misbehaving node it can block that node.
This way all the nodes are basically indirectly connected with one a other.
Nodes also keep track of all the nodes it is connected to and shares that list with other nodes so they can find and reach each other.

Decentralization is a solution to centralization. When you can eliminate the man in the middle, what use do you have for the man in the middle?
If I can hand you cash or something of value in person, why can't I do that over the internet without having to involve another party.
This is the basis of trustless and decentralized currency. Peer to peer money.
Sure this may not be a problem for you if you can trust credit card companies, banks, etc. Many other people live in countries where the government robs them of their own money.

What do you mean by "instead of merchant"?
Your private key is yours to do at your own discretion, you have control as to how you want to secure it. Use of hardware device, software wallet, paper, etc.
Credit cards on the other hand, if one of the hundreds of merchants you used your credit card with gets breached (which they almost certainly will) there is potential for fraud.
I think you are trying to say that any system can be vulnerable of a breach, which is a fair argument to make. However the key difference here is systems that hold payment information of millions of customers are a bigger honeypot than the private key of a single individual.

It is in everyone's self interest to verify every (old and new) transactions. If you don't, how can you be sure that an address you are supposedly receiving bitcoins from has sufficient balance to make that transaction. 
Transactions are sent and shared asynchronously with nodes, every transaction eventually reaches all nodes. This is called propagation time and there are websites that track this data. 
You shouldn't need to be worried about competing in this regard, well connected nodes usually get their transactions propagated only a few seconds faster than other nodes.
However even though every verified transaction is shared through all nodes, they aren't considered confirmed until a miner adds it to the next block. This is where transaction fees come in, because blocks have limited space therefore limited transactions per block, miners select transactions with highest fees. 
So the transaction you send is added to a list of unconfirmed transactions called the mempool, every node keeps track of this list and this is the list miners choose from to make their next block.

I have read the entire thread here and I'm not here to insult you, just clearing up a mis-understanding. 
You need to understand that the word "Satoshi" does not represent the lowest denominator of a bitcoin.
**Satoshi will and always be one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.**
If we make bitcoin more divisible (add more zeroes after decimal point), the new derivation has a different name.
For instance, one hundred billionth of a bitcoin is called a MilliSatoshi.
If we wanted to make let's say one hundred trillionth of a bitcoin, that would have a new name. *(Perhaps MicroSatoshi?)*'
Anyways you get the point.
By making bitcoin more divisible we are able to break it into more parts. This does not create inflation or metaphorically speaking: dividing a pizza into more parts does not give you more pizza.
    Total Supply of Bitcoin (with each unit)
    BTC = 21,000,000
    mBTC (0.001 btc) = 21,000,000,000
    Bit or μBTC (0.000001btc) = 21,000,000,000,000
    Satoshi (0.00000001btc)= 21,000,000,000,000
    MilliSatoshi (0.00000000001btc) = 2,100,000,000,000,000
There will always be a set amount of "total supply" of each unit/derivation since bitcoin itself is capped at 21 million. 
Hope that helps!

Satoshi = 1 hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC)
Satoshi is a UNIT, which means it will not change even if we choose to make bitcoins more divisible.
Think about Grams, we can make the unit of grams more divisible (milligram, microgram, etc). 
If we chose to add more zeroes, we would just create a new unit and give it a different name.
You aren't increasing the number of satoshi, the number of satoshi will always remain the same no matter what happens.

Since every subsequent block is based on the previous block all the way down to the first block (called the Genesis) made by Satoshi himself. It is hard coded into Bitcoin Core.
A new chain starting from the first block would have a different hash, which would cause that node to be separated from the rest of the Bitcoin network. In fact, you would need to make your own Node client (Genesis is hard coded into client) people would need to download your version of the client so that they can follow your rules and your starting Genesis block. 
When you first run a Bitcoin node, it connects to 12 or more other nodes and starts downloading and verifying every single block, making sure that each block subsequently follows the block before it. If let's say one of the cinnected nodes has an altered and misleading block then it is simply ignored, and if the node is misbehaving it is added to a block list.
Sometimes there are two or more chains happening just because the nodes lose sync, but eventually the nodes that are out of sync rewind back and correct their mistakes. This works out because nodes always choose the longest chain.
Basically the entire system is designed so that every individual (node) does their own validation and also helps seed or share their chain with everyone else.
This is also why it is so difficult to make changes to Bitcoin, if you remember the Segwit2x stuff a few months ago. Every node must agree on the new rules, if they don't they seperate and two distinct chains form each with their own rules.
Bitcoin itself, is just a group of nodes that have agreed to follow certain rules. It doesn't even have to be Bitcoin Core, you can use any client so long that if follows the rules. If you change those rules you can no longer be part of the group of nodes we call Bitcoin.

This has to be the possibly worst constructed bullshit I've read on this subreddit.
Bitcoin is useless? Because... it took a dip? *"The bubble crashed?"*
This is a technology that has made the first decentralized store of value that has eliminated the need to trust the 3rd party. Yet, the technology still continues to be adopted and developed as we speak.
The conversion ratio between Bitcoin and USD does not halt the active growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:20:41
In theory, yes it is possible. A single node can misbehave, and other nodes can see that bad behavior and disconnect themselves from that misbehaving node. I think that even if Blockstream or any other group or government agency tried to "centralize" bitcoin, we as individuals always have the ability to run our own full node and verify blocks ourselves instead of depending on other services.
So I would agree that it is better to use an internet connection and run a node rather than to depend on a satellite, but of course not everyone has the luxury of a good internet connection. 
Edit: I would also like to point out the implications of editing or deleting blocks or transactions within a single block. Since all blocks depend on the blocks before them, editing a single transaction will change the hash of its block and the blocks that would come afterwards. Thus, making that chain invalid.

Yeah volume change does affect stability. If volume goes down, volatility increases. If volume goes up, volatility decreases.
When there is higher volume, its harder to affect market price.
I think we can both agree that Bitcoin is not just a new technology, but also a new market as well. It needs time to develop, grow infrastructure, and reach enough adoption to get to a point where it's volatility isn't going to be a big thing that people will be concerned about.
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:14:45
Sure it does, US dollar is held by a lot of countries and as a result is probably the most dependable (and least volatile) Fiat currency in the world.
If the fed reserve decided to hyper inflate the US dollar by overprinting the supply, it would weaken the stability and lessen the volume.
Volume isn't the only factor, but is an important one in terms of having a stable and a well established currency.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:09:15
Bitcoin had the most volume during the spike around Dec 20'ish. 
Of course as we know, that bubble quickly popped. You had people who knew nothing about BTC "invest", and those same people sold shortly after.
During the early 2010-11 era, you would see higher price fluctuations on a more constant basis compared to the volatility as seen today.
We can even take into account of the bubble pops in 2011, 2013, and 2017. Each less "volatile" than the next.
And I predict as this cycle goes on, over and over, you will have more and more volume, more people involved, and more infrastructure built around BTC. Eventually lowering the volatility as time goes on.

It's only volatile because the market cap and volume isn't high enough to not be heavily influenced by traders and whales.
If it is to ever reach adoption to the point as you describe, it would be way less volatile.
@_date: 2019-01-20 05:44:56
When I mean volume, I am talking about active BTC in trading exchanges. It is harder to influence price when there is higher volume. You can track this sort of data in coinmarketcap.
Compared to the very early days of Bitcoin, you would see way higher volatility than compared to today as there was less people and volume in the markets.
USD is traded against euros, yen, etc. So it maintains a very high volume in traditional markets as well.
I think you are talking about supply, do not confuse the two.
Bitcoin can't ever face hyperinflation (in terms of fiat) as it has a max cap of about 21 mil btc, unlike fiat.
Both FIAT and BTC is vulnerable to different things, we are talking about a currency that is dependent on the trust and function of central banks, versus a currency that is dependent on the network of nodes and miners. 
IMO, a large scale power loss (in the US) would arguably hurt the dollar more than anything, as majority of USD transactions are done digitally bank to bank. This will also cause many people to be unable to use their bank accounts and withdraw money, and so forth. Bitcoin can maintain its ledger even if most nodes disconnect from the network, and can "re-sync" effectively.

You keep contradicting yourself.
Earlier you stated that the reasoning behind the volatility is the low 200 billion market cap. Which is a fair point.
As Bitcoin adoption grows this volatility decreases and stabilizes over time.
Mind you that in the grand scheme of things we are still considered early adopters.
You are right that it is not feasible to start replacing Bitcoin for USD at the very moment.
If you were to run a store, it's hard to accept payments in Bitcoin then have the value of that bitcoin drop by half when your bills are due.
This is why services like Bitpay (Or other payment processors) exist, where they convert the value of Bitcoin to USD or other national currency at the time the payment is made.
Bitcoin in that regard still works as a currency and as a way for more merchants to accept Bitcoin without having to be concerned about volatility.
As explained above, this is only a dilemma for the short term when Bitcoin is dealing with a low market cap.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:25:11

I feel like the media attention around Bitcoin has sort of declined. You can also see this in Google Trends, search results for Bitcoin declined since the price peak in December.
Though I'm not sure exactly what caused the price to decline exactly and whether that the price is the result of lost interest.
A lot of people here on Reddit say it's the Mt Gox dumps.

Yes, the Bitcoin difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks. The difficulty is based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the rate of 10 minutes per block , 2016 blocks should take two weeks to find. If it is found faster two weeks, the difficulty increases, and vice versa.
You can find more details on difficulty here 
And the chart here 
Currently running a full node is around 160 gb of storage. You can find a new 1tb drive around $50 ish. As storage becomes cheaper it should accommodate bitcoin's growing Blockchain , and with offchain transactions less data would be stored in the ledger .

Bitcoin doesn't need to be stable in order to grow....
How do you think we got from a fraction of a penny to each coin being worth $6k.
Again as I've responded to your previous comments in this thread, stability is not a pre-requisite.


What gives Gold its value, or Paper money? Are we going to argue about the fundamentals of what value is?


You can't duplicate a Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin out of the 21 million total cap is unique. Therefore scarcity is already estabilished.


You have no clue what you are talking about, I'm going to go ahead and guess you are talking about Bitcoin Forks? Creating a fork of Bitcoin does not increase the supply of bitcoins, it simply copies the chain and runs another version of it that has its own limit and supply. I suggest you do research on how that works.
 *But you will probably waste more time coming up with more bullshit*

There are still wallets that require a login but don't hold your unencrypted keys.
Edge wallet for example (which is in the Bitcoin.org list), host your keys for you. But the keys themselves are encrypted by your password. This way you don't have to worry about losing your seed, or your keys being controlled  by another party. This can be appealing to newbies that are used to the traditional way of just memorizing a username and password combination.

Block reward halves from 12.5 BTC to 6.25.
Miners are a large portion of the BTC being sold.
If they make as half as much Bitcoin as they used to do, they sell less Bitcoin.
That decreases the supply of Bitcoin going to exchanges which eventually drives up the price.
@_date: 2018-07-13 05:50:05
Definitely pick one up, either a Trezor or Ledger if you hold a significant amount of crypto.
The significance is that your private key is generated and stored offline. Private keys stored in devices connected to the internet have greater chance of being compromised.
It's different from an encrypted USB because you still have to generate private keys on a device connected to the internet through that route.

I guess block size increase is one way to go about it. I think there are ways to scale it from LN as well such as concepts like channel factories which let you create channels through an existing channel.
Realistically I don't think Lightning would get THAT much attention and adoption all at once, but still important to talk about.
Imo, segwit2x should have gone through.
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:32:24
They already pledged to support Segwit, after all it benefits them, the bitcoin community and most of all the users that use the wallet.
Since you are a developer, you should understand that these things take time and not overnight.
There's plenty of other wallets you can use that support Segwit in the meantime.
You don't choose the target or their priorities for their product, they do.
They work on it, they spend money and time on it.
I don't think its fair to say that they are "attacking bitcoin", if you want to scrutinize you can always go after the fraudulent wallets/services out there that are actually doing the attacking.

In order to create a decentralized, trustless, self-sustaining ledger, efficiency had to be sacrificed. 
This is why technologies such as the Lightning Network are being worked on to solve this dilemma and expand the capabilities of Bitcoin.
No one knows what the price will be tomorrow, but one thing I can say for sure is that Bitcoin as a technology is still developing and always has been from the very start.

It's a good working solution, but I don't think it's worth to compromise your loss of ownership of your bitcoins to use a centralized service. Sure $50 may seem like a small amount as they say. Imagine if a larger hub was compromised resulting in the theft of all the users who had their funds stored there.
