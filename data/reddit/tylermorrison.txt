Typically crypto currencies rise in uncertain times. However, we can't discount the truth that a large-scale cyber attack will precede any major war between larger, developed nations. Georgia is a perfect example of this.
So that begs the question, what happens if your country's entire internet gets shut down for an extended period of time and you can't send / receive transactions?

I bought a BitPay debit card. It essentially allows you to quickly reload a prepaid debit card using your BTC wallet.
That being said, if you're an American like myself, beware of using BTC for everyday purchases.
**The IRS treats BTC as property.** Therefore, even if Acme Coffee has a savy owner that loves BTC, you have to beware converting BTC back to fiat on a regular basis. You're not only buying a cup of coffee you're also initiating a taxable event that will eventually require you to pay capital gains for that same purchase.
There are tax automation software solutions like LibraTax to make things easier, but its an important factor to keep in mind.

I’m all about the HODL life, but there’s a reason I liquidated 90% of my BTC at $1270

I am no chart expert by a LONG SHOT, but I'm not sure we've got bottom yet. China is just waking up. I would presume a lot of those traders anticipated this swing as well. If they proceed in ETF as well we might see a second dip.
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:45:47
As an American, my answer is absolutely not.
Don't get me wrong; I own a BitPay card, I believe wholeheartedly in emerging crypto technology, and am developing my own projects as well.
That said, any BTC to fiat conversion is a taxable event according to the IRS. I refuse to pay capital gains tax just to buy a cup of coffee.

Not to be rude, but if you're asking a question as reductive as "is it worth it?", I'm not sure you're ready to be trading any of the exchanges.
Yes, many traders are profiting in GDAX and elsewhere. But before doing so they analyze the question for themselves...
- What is the volatility of X market at Y exchange?
- How does the volume of this exchange compare to others?
- What is the fee schedule of the exchange?
- Does the exchange offer an API that would require me to compete against bots?
Etc, etc... If you're looking to go into trading BTC without a plan, you will get spanked by the market.

Trying to avoid the IRS is stupid. Just keep records and pay the capital gains.
Yes, if you're technically savvy you could essentially launder your money via privacy focused alt coins like Monero. However, any exchange that deals with USD will have strict KYC requirements. Eventually the govt will audit those and you're more than likely to be discovered.
I'm not a fan that the IRS treats BTC as "property", but it's much easier to keep accurate records than go to jail for tax evasion.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:46:49
True. But I found that, in practice, you get hit with partial taker fees because of the constantly shifting order books.

Just because you **can** leverage 2.5x doesn't mean you *SHOULD*. I short alts frequently, but I do so only after calculating my risk / reward.
If anyone is getting spanked by the 20% maintenance level, they probably need to re-evaluate their money management so they don't get margin called.

The HODL dogma is such a double-edged sword. You only need to ask yourself two questions to see this…
1. Is Bitcoin going to revolutionize the global economy?
2. What extreme innovations occurred this month that can justify a +200% increase in Total Market Cap?
To the first point, I would personally answer "More than likely, but nothing is guaranteed". To the second, it's clearly dumb money and rampant speculation.
People declare HODL in an almost religious fashion without understanding that A) It misleads newcomers who inevitably get burnt in the correction, and B) Very few people are actually **using** this technology for anything beyond speculation at the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:03:27
Why bother asking this? You already set your own strategy based on your equity / goals / risk tolerance.
If I tell you "I invest 50% because of XYZ reason" …Does that change anything about your reality?

What you're describing is not "market manipulation". This happens in literally EVERY asset class — stocks, commodities, forex, etc.
Market Makers with lots of money and experience understand their playing field better than the new investors. They also routinely throw their money around to go on "fishing expeditions" for stop-loss orders to see how they can move price in their favor.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:34:35
I'm sorry, but this theory is moronic… bordering on "tin foil hat" levels of stupidity.
Rather than assuming "The Man" engineered some giant market manipulation that precisely timed to baking holidays, let's use some common sense…
 Step 1
Go to the [Total Market Cap Chart on CoinMarketCap](
 Step 2
Zoom in to the last 3 months.
 Step 3
Ask yourself what could possibly justify the entire crypto economy from ~$25 B to ~$90 B in such a short period?
- Did BTC solve scaling? …Nope
- Did a new Dapp revolutionize life? …Nope
- Are there new financial engines to onboard institutional investors? …Nope
 Conclusion
Rather than concurring some bizarre conspiracy about "market manipulation", consider the simplest answer… rampant speculation led to yet another bubble and dumb money got burnt in the process.
Every coin went parabolic and eventually gravity takes control again. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:21:27
If you're watching the markets and news this closely, why do you think selling = "gone for forever"?
In the current bull trend that we just experienced, it was **REALLY** obvious when things went parabolic. Why not scale out before the crash?
Just because you take profits doesn't mean you're barred from buying back in after a correction. Doing so would actually increase your BTC holdings long term.

Just because the fundamental technology is revolutionary, does not mean it's going to automatically pay investment dividends.
The Internet is more powerful now than it was in 1998, but that sure didn't stop the tech bubble and bankrupt tons of naive or negligent investors.
There is no assurance that the current bull run will continue indefinitely. Imagine you're taking out this loan for BTC "investment" at 2013. How would you make payments *(plus interest)* during a two year bear trend?

I think you can absolutely learn more about the fundamentals of the technology and its development; however, I recommend **not** asking about specifics regarding finances.
Asking about other people's % allocation is pretty useless because there are many factors beyond asset risk / belief in the network.
 The Golden Rule of Bitcoin


@_date: 2017-05-09 13:57:30
**DO. NOT. TAKE. A. LOAN. FOR. AN. INVESTMENT.**
Let's assume you have stellar credit can can secure some obscenely low fixed APR (15% for a nice round number). Not only do you have to successfully trade a volatile market, you have to outgrow your debt.
Top traders usually use 25% yearly growth as a typical benchmark. So if you were an A+ trader, you will make only 10% return. But let's be honest, no professional trader would take that kind of risk.

Gravity. It's making insane speculation. Just look at the insanity of [Total Market Cap across all crypto](
**May 1, 2017** = ~$37 Billion
**Earlier this morning** = ~$90 Billion
Now you tell me, what revolutionary achievements sparked ~150% growth in less than a month. I'll just wait here…

I think the "missing link" required for the smart contracts to really flourish is a more robust / reliable system of third-party  data. In my opinion, the insurance industry will be radically transformed once you can automatically verify certain events…
For example, imagine worker's comp / payroll management. You hire a new employee…
SMART CONTRACT 1 — Covers terms of employment. Forget bi-weekly pay periods. An employer could stipulate payment every 10 minutes… "If employee John Doe meets X, Y, and Z conditions, he's on the clock" …a smart contract can handle that payment automatically 24/7 until terminated.
SMART CONTRACT 2 — Covers payroll management. Each 10 min cycle that John Doe gets compensated could automatically route percentages of the payment to tax accounts, retirement, health benefits, etc.
SMART CONTRACT 3 — Covers worker's comp. John Doe got hurt on the job. After receiving digital medical records that confirm said injury + confirmation that he was on the clock at time of incident, it automatically disburses benefits for XYZ period of time.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:22:42
That is far too reductive.
If you try and use [Webster's Definition of “manipulate”]( half of the definitions refer to objective, skill-based utilization while the other two broadly describe any concept of “fairness”.
If you’re that simplistic, literally **any given trade** can be seen as “manipulation”. After all, the buyer and the seller are always competing for their version of the “best price” so “fairness” really is a matter of perspective.
If you want to look at **REAL** [market manipulation]( and fraud, you should research the established Forex markets which is controlled by just **5 actors** who leverage their position, thereby gaining a fraudulent advantage.
Even if the scheme above is true, the advantage of those 3 individuals **nothing** compared to other currency pairs. Just do the math…
- Current BTC in Circulation = just over *16 MILLION* BTC
- Presumed Equity = 5,000 BTC (15,000 in total group)
- Market Percentage = 0.03% (0.09% as a total group)
Are these guys and many others engaging in “uneconomic trading” – placing bids or offers at a price specifically designed to lose money on a standalone basis? Sure, but that's the right of anyone with the capital and risk-tolerance. If you're a smaller player, you need to just anticipate or, even better, expect that the market will act irrationally.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:47:07
Here is where you’re wrong…


**No one is “forcing” anyone to do anything.** Pretending otherwise is just an excuse for poor or uneducated traders to excuse bad decisions. We all know the rules of the market going in and we all have equal access to the tools at hand.
More importantly, you're trying to reduce an incredibly complex system of wants / needs / reactions of an entire market into a simplistic "Someone did X and everyone else did Y" argument without having any ability to truly examine causality.
But let's take the example of just you for a moment...
Lets say that a “whale” comes on your favorite exchange and places a giant **uneconomic trade** on the BTC/USD books. No one is *forcing* you to buy / sell at that instant.
Did you panic at the sudden price swing and abandon your position at an unprofitable time? …That's on you.
“But what about my stop-loss?“ you ask. …That's on you as well.
No one forced you to put that order in at that level. Every actor in the market knows the rules about how those orders work and those rules are enforced fairly. Just because you and a large swath of others assumed the price wouldn't rise or fall to XYZ price, it was a clear possibility.
We all have the same knowledge and same ability to execute our own plans. Some traders are just going to be better than you and have the right amount of capital / risk tolerance to experiment outside of the normal trader. We all know that risk coming in and crying “manipulation” just shows a lack of maturity about your own choices.
 So What *IS* Manipulation?
In traditional Forex there are tons of examples of institutions using their exclusive access to defraud others. It typically boils down to some sort of time or information advantage they possess that the average individual could never achieve.
For example – [RBS Promises Not to Trade Against Clients](


 Conclusion
In crypto, we are trading on our own behalf. We make our own decisions. No one **forces** you to make any trade or place any order. So crying foul whenever someone with more knowledge, capital, or risk tolerance out maneuvers you just shows a lack of understanding of the market.
**If you frequently feel “manipulated”, you should probably stop trading and reassess your strategy.**

Why not earn BTC? Crypto currency is still so new that there are very few people with a true understanding.
If you start studying crypto, smart contracts, and computer science now, you will have a specialized knowledge that gives you the edge over 99% of people in the industry.
Short-term, you can use that insight to write articles to make a little BTC on the side. Long-term, you'll be positioned to MAKE BANK compared to other kids your age.

I had the best experience using Bank Transfer. That said, I would recommend you also look at Gemini. They have a system that pre-credits any bank transfer deposit so that you can begin trading immediately. Once the transfer clears you are able to withdraw the BTC to any external wallet that you own.
