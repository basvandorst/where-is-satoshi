Definitely most funny part:
*"the new system would be, in a sense, too streamlined, making it easier for bank runs to occur in a moment of crisis or panic. In most current financial systems, large-scale withdrawals of funds are naturally slowed by the time it takes for a central bank to produce the paper money people are demanding. But if the currency is purely digital, no such brakes exist—a panicked citizenry could empty their accounts almost instantly, leaving an entire country’s banking system all but penniless."*
The "power" of fractional reserve, haha

15% of global trading, but...

... and communists will have a new toy
be able to play with the network then

LTC, VTC - it would be strange to have atomic cross-chain transactions without bitcoin onboard...
so, bitcoin: go ahead! :)
