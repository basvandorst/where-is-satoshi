About how much are bitcoins worth in US dollars right now? Because to me, this sounds like a lot of work especially if you run the risk of being beaten to the solution by more dominant pools. Also, who makes the algorithms. And what is one actually solving for in the algorithm?

Interesting. What does it mean to "hash?" And the sole purpose of this algorithm and all the mining is security?

Yeah that's what I figured. Makes sense. Thanks. One more question. Does mining require actual work by a person or does it simply generate bitcoins for the person who owns the hardware (software?) that is verifying the transactions?

Interesting. So have these pools then turned into businesses? Or is it not *that* profitable?

This is very good. I think I understand the basics of how bitcoin works now. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 05:22:13
Okay. But does mining require the user to give their computer system commands or can they just sit back and watch the bitcoins flow in?

This seems great but I do not entirely understand it because I do not know what a block is. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 06:57:03
What are "blocks?"

So, in a nutshell, software/hardware is developed and used by miners who compete against each other to solve the algorithms, which are becoming increasingly more difficult. 25 bitcoins are rewarded for each block completed. The algorithm increases in difficulty so that a block is solved about every 10 minutes. Is this all correct?
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:03:50
I thought the reward value was always 25 bitcoins?

That is really cool. I'm not interested in doing any mining myself and it sounds like it is far beyond my means but that's really interesting.

Thanks for the article. Is there a plan for how mining will be compensated once this limit is reached?
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:00:28
So it's becoming less and less profitable?
