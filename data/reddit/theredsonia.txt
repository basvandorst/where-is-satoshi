Roger Ver is the biggest douchebag in crypto and I refuse to enable him with my money.

Coinsquare is trash. Another option would be to get a real wallet, transfer the funds to it then use coinatmradar.com to find a cheap atm to cash out at.

I snuck in at just less than $9G and doubled my investment a few hours ago, but now, bot so much. Go back up!

Just a quick happydance brag before the markets contract: I doubled my investment just now. Bought in just before the $9K milestone, grabbed again at the end of November, and threw a last couple bucks into LTC last weekend while it was still $130ish. Coin Market Cap is now my favourite video game. WOOHOO okimdonenao HODL 2023

I saw a thread recently of someone who did this by remembering a number of the words in his seed then running a piece of software to put the words in order, but I don’t think he started trying to code break his seed from scratch. Even partially knowing his seed it still took the code breaking software months to crack.
Good luck and Godspeed.

If you get the Calibre desktop app it will reformat books for you, as well as manage your library.

Not really, but massive fees when moving coin to an actual wallet, long hold times on wire transfer funds (which I heard they eliminated), and I don’t trust exchanges in general.

�� HODL onto your nuts!
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:53:59
I’ll settle for breaking even.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:12:10
I won’t die without my investment breaking even but I’d be sad to lose even $50 on a bad bet. I have no choice right now but to HODL, cashing out would be too depressing, like admitting total failure. Let us commiserate electronically. There there. Maybe one day the FOMO investors will return and we’ll buy ourselves self-driving Sky Lambos in our mansions on the Mars colony.

Dare to dream! I haven’t lost my life savings but for a hoodrat like me, I’ve lost a couple major opportunities.

You’d have to give me a BTC for me to install and use Snapchat. That shit gives me ADD.
