So this is my absolutely uninformed opinion:
Just reading the words ETF, Wall Street, Winklevoss and investor makes me cringe. This has all the hallmarks of some wall street bullshit "fund" which will eventually end up issuing more shares than they can actually cash out.
And then we will have a digital equivalent of a fraudulent investment fund.
I thought Gold ETFs meant that it was paper gold and if we go by the same model then this is paper bitcoin. The problem with paper trading is that its not really real. The potential for the greedy bastards on wall street to "sell" paper bitcoin more than what they actually own is very much there.
I would not buy into this ponzi scheme.

I am going on good faith here and if this is true then you need to start a blog to keep your sanity. Restriction on free thought at your age will only screw you up in the long run.
As for your teacher, I do not hate her because I understand the mindset she is coming from. And if properly analysed it will most likely reveal a deep rooted fear of what might happen if she strays from the conformist opinion of society and an actual desire to protect you from the world.
Unfortunately she like the other 90% of the planet have no idea of how controlled society is today and how more restricted it is becoming at an alarming rate. If she knew that she was a cog in that system then perhaps maybe she would reconsider.
So in summary: Do not expect much from this world and stick to what you feel is right. As cheesy as it might be, your heart always knows what is good for you.
