I think most people who believe in bitcoin agree with your point.  The problem, as I see it, is that we've seen virtually no meaningful development (apps, merchant acceptance, browser magic) in the past 3 years.  There's no easy place to spend or obtain them.
Am I just being impatient?  Or is this an indicator for the next decade?

I used to think the same thing regarding the USD.
But when you do the math, it doesn't have to overtake the USD.  Even a tiny amount of hedging guarantees massive price increase.  See:  2017
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:19:12

 Correct.  And there was plenty of warning, and discussion in the forums beforehand.

I love this idea.  Should be easy to set it up (move a specified small amount from an account with &gt;3 Btc or whatever)

Completely agree.  You can't double in price over 2 months based on nothing then assume we've simultaneously been "pricing in" an event 8 months away.

What about the volume of money in the pool now (vs in 2013)?  It seems like the hype would have to be 10x what it was in 2013 to have a similar effect simply due to the cat being "out of the bag" to some extent.

But if you're going to spend the money (presumably USD) anyway, just opt to use BTC.  Then replace the spent BTC by buying them back at the market price.  Everyone wins, right?

I was just like you.  And I even said that same statement.
Only the price was $128/coin, and I had just watched it spike from $10 each.  Boy was I wrong.  "Cheap" is a relative concept, and only works when looking backward.
I'd say buy a fraction of a coin, $50 worth.  If it goes sky-high, you'll be happy you did!  If it doesn't, you'll learn a valuable $50 lesson!

Bitcoin can moon without fiat crashing.  There's a lot of fiat out there.  Trillions.

Same here.  Feels good, right?
It's funny.  I've had a bank account for a long time.  Never seen that money.  Maybe tiny bits of it here and there.  But I've never been to the bank, and said "can I just go into the vault and play with my tiny pile of cash?"
But now that I see my "digital" money, it feels more real than the "real" money ever did.  And it's just a number.  But I know I've got control of it.  I can move it wherever I want, hide it, store it....

I got really excited when I saw the title "infographic", but that's not really what this is.  The info contained comes across as bullets from a powerpoint slide with arbitrary clip art.
I think some of the terminology needs to be explained (i.e., hard fork vs. soft fork, transaction malleability, etc.).
An infographic should be able to explain itself to a 7 year old.  Good luck!

Mathematically possible, but there's not enough liquidity for us to shoot up there in any "bubble-like" timeframe.  It would be a hell of a volatile ride to get there--just too many people cashing out along the way.

But you seem to be counting your eggs before they've hatched.  And calling paper money a "worthless iou" is pretty fucking crazy man.  People will do literally anything for those IOUs.

Since everyone here just wants to say "blah blah you can't ban it", I'll give it a shot.
To me, trump is all about appearances.  His whole brand, his campaign, his life.  Why bother attacking something most people have never heard of, and the rest regard as a failed "cyber money Ponzi scheme"?  Seems to me that he'd rather attack easier, less obscure targets.
If he did try to crack down (I can believe it), I think it would suck a ton of wind out of bitcoin's sail.  We're the world's biggest economy, so making people flee the asset would be pretty terrible, especially considering that most of its current value is speculation-based.
What do I know, though, you can't kill Bitcoin its invincible moon next week mark my words.

Lower fees = less profit for miners.  
Higher fees = constrained Bitcoin growth.
Do miners stand to make more money by increasing bitcoin's popularity and use?
Would lower fees ultimately hurt miners if bitcoin's utility grew as a result?

Honestly... I can't see how you're not right about this.  Forget peons that have just a few bitcoins; there are institutions and individuals with thousands of them.
If China owns most, wouldn't the US want to curb that value?  Or vice versa if it were the US?

Unfortunately the history of network spam (see: BCH et al.) makes that a cloudy metric at best.
The way I see it, more people every day are learning about it.  It's no big deal for the majority of folks (e.g., r/investing) to decide that it's not for them; all that matters is that the ones who will use it continue to find it.
Just my thoughts.

There are other arguments against emotional dismissal of its potential, but that one should be compelling enough for any logical investor to allocate *some* portion of their balanced portfolio to Bitcoin.
If you are 30% Bitcoin, obviously you are a gambler.  If you are .1 or .5%, you are smarter than most.  If you are zero, you are an emotional fool with your head in the sand, just like those who are 90%.  
A decade of data should be enough for you to make a somewhat informed decision.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:22:09
It's up, what, 5000% over the past year?
It could settle back to $2,000/coin and it would still trounce the S&amp;P's return over the same period.
