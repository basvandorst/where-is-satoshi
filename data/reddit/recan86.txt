Jack and Jill went up the hill with each a buck and a quarter. 
Jill came down with two fifty. 
What a whore ! :)

Because they don't wan it traced back to them. Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:24:10
It's not official. This is what happens and misinformation drives the bitcoin down because people panic sell. Let's remember china has "said " this a few times now and it's never been true. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:06:45
Sweet. Thanks a lot. Do you know if/when you guys will be able to make ones for dark coin?
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:14:31
This seems appropriate. 
Oooh yesss 
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:37:30
Whhhhhhaaaaatt. Raining bits in this b*\&lt;h !!! 
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:12:53
Anyone ever try this site before?
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:35:38
Is there anything like this for alt-coins as well? It would be nice to have a bunch of different ones on one app. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:16:43
You don't have a bank account you can verify? If not then I would suggest localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:10:36
I appreciate the honesty. I am only looking to modify an existing idea and this is a more accurate description. If I explained exactly what I wanted to do regardless to add or modify then obviously I would be shooting myself in the foot. Just looking for some help with this reality and adding a different perspective.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:38:15
Thanks so much. Very informative. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 22:37:41
Tell her if she does care then put that stuff away. You have to pack for another conference. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:50:58
Sweet thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:34:24
Like anything else I'll hear you out and make my decision at the end. Those who are already passing judgement are closing there minds not about a person but a perspective. How does anyone grow if they don't listen. 
Edit. My first tip is to write this out on a doc then copy and paste it to here. Not to say you type slow but at least the there would be one cohesive thought to this thread. I'll wait... 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:58:12
Hahahaha. Thanks. Yolo. Ha. Yes. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:31:07
Could you elaborate more please?
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:02:07
Is there a good source for a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:25:01
Verso wallet 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:43:08
BTMs? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:24:46
Did it take two weeks for delivery? I live in the US so time is a concern. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:17:21
I've tried verso card. I like them and I'm on iOS 
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:23:12
The same aay they use ATMs. Or have you never noticed the drive through ATMs have brail on them. :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:03:47
Not to mention it doesn't work with US KYC or AML 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:58:22
That's exactly what I mean
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:00:00
Which app is that ? It sends you updates in price without havering to check it? Sweet. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:46:56
Just heard about that. Is it positive or jus more negative drama? Oh wait... The good wife. Nevermind. :)

You could always work as an escort. I say escort because hooking  is illegal. Although it is the oldest profession. 
Holla for a dolla. 
Do somethin strange for a little piece of change.  
Cluck for a buck. 
Bite for that bit. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:38:25
How is this server kept physically secure?
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:16:37
I want these bits of which you speak of. :)
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:54:14
What site is this?
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:55:56
Which way will it go??? Thoughts?
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:34:09
Creepy. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:31:58
I've used versocard. It seems to be working well for me. However now that there is little trust in localbitcoin where do I go to buy them with cash?
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:52:01
I only got 10penis. You should be able to give more orbits than that. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 19:45:48
Can anyone verify if this is legit?
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:22:01
So you are making these machines? Will you be leasing/selling them to individuals/companys ? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:29:48
Doesn't it have to he registered to you?
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:31:55
I keep hearing about flaws but I haven't found any. Care to explain?

Send me colored coins. I'm no racist. In fact, the more color the better!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:19:04
Not sure where you live and no offense to you but so far .. Out of the sources given you have said you don't trust them.  I have used one since bitcoin has become what it is today and I have zero complaints. Are you sure you're just not biest or slanting your view to what you think is right? Just a question. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:55:07
So do I. I live in Cape Coral. I doubt you know where that is but I ordered my card on the 1st hopefully it will be here soon. If you're ever around here send me a message. I always enjoy chatting with fellow coiners. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:53:24
Is there a time limit to leave your coins in there? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:31:45

  Bubbles was the girl next door. :)

I just purchased one myself. Let me know if it works please. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:46:32
None in the United States? Just curious why no one has thought of this yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:31:11
Be able to use such program with all the awesomeness across different crypto platforms. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:58:34
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:40:10
Not letting me contact you. Pm me please. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:04:47
It's a cold storage wallet. I've been using it for a few months and I like it. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:55:16
What about a salt water test for people who are always at sea. Don't get me wrong steal sinks but what if you could add a hole to a corner of the design 
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:47:11
So what's the original site?
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:26:53
Where is it at? :)
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:04:36
Can someone break this down in simple terms for the noob here? 
Hint: that's me. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:19:40
I would treat it just like my prom date. I don't care if she was passed out on the floor. I would pull that dress up and slide those panties to the side. Daddy spent enough money on this and he's going in. Deep n Hard. Deep n Hard. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:32:19
This isn't re first or even second time bitcoin has been mentioned. Each time is hasn't been negative.  Kinda cool 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:59:12
Where are you guys based? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:44:50
I use that as well. It's just weird how no one has come up with a multi wallet yet. Thanks for help though 
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:30:35
For what it's worth coinbase is super easy. Didn't local get attacked today? Not sure how much that's different from the Feds knocking at your door. Both want your money. Isn't there anything else??
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:22:05
16AeYMHXHMVViqR5phbdyiMM8hhcTSDBYu Let's see if this bs works. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:19:35
Dark coin. Algorithm is solid and exactly what people want 
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:24:44
Do you live in the U.S?
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:42:25
Where did you learn how to become a security researcher 
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:56:58
Shouldn't j get more as a pioneer? 
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:40:12
Personally. As a new person to bitcoin I would recommend coinbase because it's easy and you don't have to worry about being scammed. I would recommend you research more. Don't just take my opinion. Bitcoin.org is a good place to start for information. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:51:38
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:02:50
Is dark wallet not available for Mac yet?
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:40:21
How is this legit?
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:40:30
Nevermind if it's illegal. I'm sure the secret service has more to worry about rather than that. Where did you get the stamp?
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:38:34
What happens in two note weeks?
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:58:41
Did you do it yourself ? If not then how?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:45:02
But then you have to trust the private key given. How could you ensure payment and not getting screwed over ? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:10:42
Yea but through all the exchanges I have been introduced required pictures of license. I guess I don't see how it's hidden. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:11:57
Besides local coin what else is there? I don't like the idea of carrying large amounts of cash to see strangers. Just a thought.
