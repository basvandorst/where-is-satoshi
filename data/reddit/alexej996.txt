It is already being worked on. Video tutorials too.
You can already find some older ones on youtube when Bisq was called Bitsquare.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:33:27
You send fiat directly to other trader, multisigs and security deposits insure the trade's security.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:09:40
Exactly, it is the same thing as with Bitcoin. It is more useful when there are more people using it, but it is a bigger opportunity to get started when you are one of the first.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:27:36
* Volume is always increasing, hopefully we can all help with that
* Fees are only high because it works over Bitcoin network which currently has high fees. Trading on LTC or Dash network will make fees very small, just enough to stop the spam.
* Trades can often take a couple of hours nowadays, but the max trade period allowed is usually days as the exchange is P2P
* Could you clarify for the execution and counterparty risk?
Bisq uses security deposits and multisigs to insure that traders follow the protocol.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:52:20
Exactly. Besides, there is nothing to shut down, as you said it is decentralized.
Bisq is not a company, it is an open source project, just like Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:12:52
They are not as trusted as Silk Road was. It was also a demonstration for the government that they can shut it down, I am not sure that would apply to a decentralized open source project, as they are supposed to be trustless.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:51:19
Keep in mind that Bisq is not a company, it is an open source decentralized project. As for the privacy coins, you can set Dash for base currency.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:38:54
Usually first security deposit isn't an issue as friends usually lend you these small amounts, but there are many ways you can earn this small amount of BTC. There is even a subcategory on the forum where people lend each other BTC for their first trade, but usually this isn't needed.
Fiat transfers are P2P, you only send money to other users directly without any mention of Bitcoin. It is not likely that you will have problems with this, but you can always only trade with people you traded with before, if you are worried.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:49:59
Same thing goes for Bitcoin. Even for Internet to be honest. Users come naturally when there is good technology. :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:07:10
Yes, you can trade any altcoin and fiat. It is just that these are direct trading pairs used for technical reasons (multisig needs to be supported and all that).
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:14:14
There are a lot more contributors for all kinds of other operations, like translation for example. There are also few roles like twitter operator, forum operator, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:40:19
These issues are always minor ones. No one ever lost funds in Bisq.
Private keys are very well secured and the trade happens on the blockchain with multisigs. Having seed words, there is not much that can go wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:21:00
BSQ is a colored Bitcoin. It is there to provide funding for the development and a way of voting in the DAO. Bisq wants to be fully decentralized so a token was needed to further decentralize it's development.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:02:01
It is always increasing. It increased a lot recently. Create a good offer and not only will people take it but it will make more people join and speed up the domino effect. If the tech is good, the platform is good. It is just like Bitcoin, you need more users using it which will come quite naturally.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:58:20
Almost all national currencies are supported. You might just need to go to Settings in the app to list it in your drop down menu.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:47:23
 The website doesn't work for me. Just shows empty graphs with no data in it.
 I don't think that is true either.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:12:56
Well that is the thing. This doesn't exist in Bisq. That is why there is no F2F option, only verifiable tamper-proof payment methods are allowed.
You have arbitrators that you and other trader lock security deposit and BTC trade amount with in 2-of-3 multisig. If the arbitrator verifies the payment has been sent, he will unlock those BTC even if the other trader doesn't want to.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:03:25
There are videos and documentations that are being worked on currently and should soon be available.
You can check more outdated tutorials on youtube when Bisq was called Bitsquare :)
PS: Bisq contributor here.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:57:12
Yes you can, as with huge amount of other altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:38:25
To sell it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:07:06
Bisq depends on bitcoinj library for most of the operations on Bitcoin network, including transactions. So it will maybe have to wait until they implement it, but if you know anyone that has the skills to help out, he can join our Slack and we could get this sooner.
PS: Bisq forum operator here. Also moderator on @_date: 2018-01-07 12:00:04
It also might be quite unattractive to add if the fees are too high for this payment method. There are many other payment methods, so I don't think people have a huge problem with this generally.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:04:28
To be honest this is quite a general problem with governments that just by using Bitcoin or buying something directly from someone over the some ad would lead to the same problem.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:44:27
This is very well known to Bisq. This is why people sometimes complain about necessity to provide name corresponding to their bank account even if they are just sending fiat. The thing is that scammer would need to know some things about the victim even tho a victim would have to provide a reference in the payment anyway. This is not that easy to execute in real world scenarios.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:40:16
You send fiat and you get seller's BTC that are locked in 2-of-3 multisig with the arbitrator.
Bisq forum is most used for support.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:16:41
There has been talks about this and since Bisq is written in Java it probably would take too much effort.
The problem might be however with the fact that Bisq is P2P and might take a lot of resources for an Android app. So maybe instead of that it would be better to develop some kind of a light client that can connect to Bisq on your PC.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:48:42
Practically any altcoin that people want to add gets added to Bisq.
Bisq is just very proud of fiat trades since it is the only one that does it decentralized, there are other exchanges and technologies that can only do altcoin decentralized trades.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:10:02
It is very real. I will post it here again in case it gets edited 
You can join for more info.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:41:34
It is pretty crazy, but governments can be pretty crazy. Either way, my point was that Bisq doesn't add to any problem here.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:37:17
BTC are locked in a 2-of-3 multisig. If the seller doesn't unlock those funds with you, arbitrator will. You will also be rewarded seller's security deposit for your troubles.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:08:12
Well, come and join us! Let's increase it together. Earlier you come, more profitable it is for you to create an offer with a bigger distance from the exchange rate :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:18:00
If the problem persists, please visit our forum on  for support.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:46:26
In Bisq scammer would need to know some things about the victim even tho a victim would have to provide a reference in the payment anyway. This is not that easy to execute in real world scenarios.
Name corresponding to the bank account of the sender is necessary for the trade to be valid, otherwise the trader will lose his security deposit.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:23:14
Exactly, it is the security deposit that protects from these types of scams.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:55:19
You can use other base currencies in Bisq, like Litecoin or Dash. Bisq is not dependent on Bitcoin, it just prefers it and uses it by default.
I don't know about leveraged trading, maybe something will be figured out about this with other users playing different roles in the network.
But Bisq is focused on providing simple exchange service to general population, if you ask me.
PS: Bisq contributor here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:42:11
It took a lot less then expected.
The block  has been mined!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:53:41
Thanks for the correction :D
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:16:11
It is possible, although of course debatable, that mentioning these lower risks for every reference of Bisq is a better thing to do. I still think that a benefit is very obvious to whoever tries to fight for their privacy.
You will get perfect privacy absolutely nowhere on the Internet. But of course it is your choice if you wish to use centralized exchanges instead where your privacy is guaranteed to be taken away, then getting an objectively better privacy by using Bisq.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:18:06
According to some other replies it seems like I shouldn't unless I am sure it is allowed, as I can get banned.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:03:23
There are plans of implementing CoinJoin in Bisq, but of course I personally don't think we should consider any coins as tainted.
If someone rejects your coins, they are the problem, money is just money.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:49:37
Alice doesn't show Bob ID, that is not part of the Bisq protocol.
Bisq is quite focused on privacy.
Now of course, 10 000 USD is not allowed in Bisq, you can only trade smaller amounts. If your account is new, you can't trade more then 0.125 BTC per trade. This is around 800 USD at the moment.
Alice will need to send a trade ID as a payment reason, otherwise Bob is not obligated by the protocol to release the coins. For an attacker to start a trade, he will need to create an Account first (complemented with a salt value that proves it's age) with Alice's bank details. In other words, he will need to convince Alice to give him bank details (including a full name and bank account number) before she sends the fiat. And then convince her to place a trade ID as a reason for payment.
If all of this goes wrong, a chargeback is still hard to execute on payment methods that Bisq allows. Bisq doesn't accept Paypal or credit cards for this exact reason.
Of course what Bisq can do here is not perfect and is limited. But that is something that we can't fix. It is a failure of certain payment methods that they allow chargebacks unlike cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:20:30
However many you can fit.
The block can hold 1 transaction, but it can also hold 3000. It is up to the miner to choose which transactions get into his block, as long as he doesn't go over the block limit.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:38:06
But Bisq doesn't hold funds either. I don't see why you would go to a centralized exchange when you have an open source software here instead that is censorship resistant.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:36:25
No. If you control your private keys then you can do CPFP.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:13:00
If they learn that you are using Bitcoin, they will ban you so fast...
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:58:48
And I thought that I was the only one that noticed :D
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:14:20
Yeah, free speech of their ideas.
Everyone just picks to follow human rights when it is convenient...
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:56:36
Yeah, thanks.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:04:14
Yeah, but this guy didn't even help in exposing any government secrets.
On the perspective of human right's, free speech is free speech, but on the perspective of law, these two are quite different.
It is ridiculous what these companies will do. It just goes to show that you can't trust companies even when they don't act on behalf of the government.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:06:35
Well it is decentralized. No company that holds your funds.
I don't know if HodlHodl requires ID verification, but they are a company and even ShapeShift got bullied into it. Bisq is decentralized, no one to force to give IDs to the government.

One day he will not be able to buy a pack of gums...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:23:17
I hope you are right. From other replies it seems like I am not alone in this.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:39:24
You can always remove your wallet password, restart the app and press alt+j to get your private keys. There is no risk in using Bisq, when you install the app and your wallet gets created, just make sure you write down the seed words and your funds are safe.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:16:21
And he is right to do so, in my opinion. He wanted to let his voice be heard and everyone just banned him from using anything.
I don't care what he speaks about, free speech is free speech.
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:43:24
Locktime is a value in every Bitcoin transaction that sates the earliest block it can be mined in.
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:19:21
You can use many payment methods, including cash deposits and face to face cash trades to trade on Bisq and retain your privacy.
Not that you are likely to trade with someone who is flagged, as most are just regular users like us, but some payment methods do not require you to use your bank account at all.
It is easier, of course, no one said it is easier to use a decentralized exchange. It is just more private and secure.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:05:48
I don't really understand your reply.
Who are you referring to as Bitcoin Jesus?
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:50:02
No, you get your deposit back automatically at the end of the trade.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:19
Thanks :)

I know. Not saying you should trade Bitcoin with PayPal.
Just kinda giving an example that this is too much power.
Tomorrow they could ban your grandma and your children to ever open an account on PayPal just because you have some BTC. This is the problem.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:09:27
Overtime other arbitrators will build trust and you wont.
Risk for traders for your's such actions is still very small, due to a small chance of them getting you as an arbitrator.
While for you the risk is huge. Not only do you risk losing a very big bond upon someone getting suspicious of your common ID requests, but selling people's IDs is extremely illegal for which you risk jail time (and a forever label as a jerk).
If this is a risk you are willing to take, I better suggest an armed robbery of a bank. It is a lot less risky and far more lucrative.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:02:00
On certain markets you can complete a trade in minutes. All the fast payment methods, including altcoins are quite fast.
Spread depends on your market. More users would bring more markets having small spreads. Currently there are even markets with negative spreads, simply because someone doesn't use other peer's payment method.
Liquidity is already pretty good with EUR market and Monero. More users in other markets will help out with this as well of course.
Just like Bitcoin, more users would solve most of the drawbacks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:34:38
Posts about other cryptocurrencies are usually not allowed here as described in the community guidelines.
Why is this one allowed?
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:06:40
They would ban you for using Bitcoin as well.

If there was a web version then it wouldn't be decentralized.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:40:14
And you need to KYC. Security and privacy are both common benefits of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:02:22
You can use CPFP method to bump up your fees if you are in a hurry.
It is a shame that something like this was allowed to happen. For years we knew it was coming and the scaling solutions were not prepared.

You have arbitrators here that can help you. You can always open a dispute with cmd+o.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:16:27
Doesn't seem to me like that should be the case. That should probably change.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:13:03

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:39:21
Nothing really, it is just a nice round number, if that was your question.
It will probably be the nicest number until we reach 1 million, which will take perhaps 8 years or so.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:49:34
No, there is no reputation in Bisq.
Security is done with 2-of-3 multisigs.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:07:15
It is a free speech issue. If they can ban him for this, they will ban you for using Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:02:09
I hope that is true.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:08:46
You just need it open when you want your offer to be taken. You can freely go offline and come back another time to get your offer available again.
Of course once it is taken, you don't need to keep your PC up all the time to finish the trade, in case you need to take a trip to the bank or something.
It really isn't a problem for most users.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:06:14
It is quite worrying indeed.
It isn't that we are doing absolutely nothing, we don't want to lose our lives over this, but we are trying to switch the humanity over to Bitcoin.
At least you can't do financial discrimination when you are using crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:59:20
You can trade as many times as you want in Bisq. The limits are only per trade.
I do understand this takes a bit of patience, but there are always some costs to security and privacy.
I don't know, I wish that was true, but I am afraid that sometimes that might be enough for someone to harass you over your intentions at some point or put you on some watchlist that could unwillingly create some problems for you in future.
There is really no telling in what your data might be used for in the future and for what purposes. It surprises me everyday when I learn something more about what NSA has done or how law systems are more flawed then I previously thought.
There is a cost, but kind of an ease from worrying as well, for what might happen with this data in the future. It depends, some people have better use of high privacy, some maybe don't, it all depends I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:52:51
Yeah. F2F trades are a very new feature on Bisq and although we didn't really have these real disputes yet, it is expected for most of them to result in deposits being locked forever.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:58:13
And no ID verification?
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:17:49
That's right. They are doing us a favour for thinking instead of us and deciding on our behalf. Our heroes...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:31
It doesn't make sense to me that this is allowed on this subreddit just because someone calls him Bitcoin Jesus.
People call other cryptos Bitcoin and still aren't allowed to be mentioned here.
Let's face it, if this guy was talking something positive about the altcoin, this would not be allowed here.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:19:28
It is not for free, it requires effort and high risk.
If someone mentions that you required their ID when not necessary, you risk others speaking up as well when they see that they are not alone.
This would make you risk a very high bond, as well, of course, criminal record for selling IDs.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:35:38
No, there is no need to store the blockchain.
Bisq only needs to have access to the Bitcoin network.
If you are running a local node, that is great and Bisq will connect to it automatically. But if you don't, it will just connect to other nodes on the Internet.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:37:46
I think you are maybe not familiar with multisig transactions on the Bitcoin network and how they work. Bitcoin is a bit more complicated then some users assume, it actually doesn't send money to no one, every transaction is like a small program, a script, that defines the rules for unlocking these coins, as well as data needed to unlock them in the first place.
When you start a trade in Bisq, you take addresses (hashes of the public keys) of 3 individuals: yourself, the other trader and whichever arbitrator did you end up with for that particular trade.
Then in the Bitcoin transaction it is defined that any of these 2 individuals, by using their private keys, can unlock these funds. Arbitrator himself, even though he is not part of every trade himself due to other arbitrators, can still not unlock these funds without at least one of the peers working for him and that goes for every trade.
What you do is that you lock .01 btc and seller locks .501, for example, in the same 2of3 mutlisig transaction. If the trade goes well, you both unlock these coins where you get .501 and he gets his .001 back. This is how it's done.
In case of a dispute, arbitrator steps in and can side with one party to send him the other persons security deposit or part of it. Arbitrator never gets anything for himself, other than the trading fee at the begging of the trade and often disputes end with no person at fault, so no one loses a deposit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:05:56
Haha :D
Just trying to help out. It is just a transaction really, it is just a transaction that needs to be sent from a certain address with a very high fee.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:21:07
Your node will still have outgoing connections and serve blockchain to those nodes. There is no definite problem in not opening ports, but of course, it is a plus to allow others to connect to you whenever they wish.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:53:43
You just need to spend those coins that you sent from one of the destination addresses. If you didn't send to yourself then there is almost certainly a change address that is one of the outputs to that unconfirmed transaction.
Just spend the unconfirmed balance. The tricky part is the calculation, what is enough to increase the fee. The idea is that you set high enough fee in the new transaction to pay for both of them when added to the fee paid by the former transaction.
I am sure you can search for some tutorial if you have trouble grasping the concept.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:56:50
True, it is a chicken and egg problem. You need to volume to get volume.
Devs organized an event this Thursday (in two days) for everyone to post as many offers as they can, to wake up the market.
If you can post any offer, even if you have to special need to exchange some coins, please do, as well as anyone else that is willing to participate.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:27:04
And practically what is the difference if it was by government or by a huge company?
They have a legal right to do so, but not moral, in my opinion.
They are too big to decide who they are going to allow on their platform and who they will not.
These companies that banned him from their platform are one of the very few that have so much dominance over the industry that the guy barely has an alternative. That is the problem, if you allow companies to establish near-monopolies and then let them ban and sanction people per their will, you will not have a democracy, but autocracy.
In few years, when Google owns everything on the Internet, if you say that wide adoption of Google services is a treat to our privacy, you will not be able to use the Internet. They will ban you from any site that requires Google's captchas, going over Google's fibber optic cables, or practically 99% of the Internet.
Then you try to use your free speech and get you point across, good luck...
If they choose to be anti-Bitcoin, they will not let anyone know about it. Probably even demonize it in the media and effectively destroy it.
Giving these companies so much power is fine if you trust them, but I f*cking don't.
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:04:34
It is just a PR move to earn some points with people who don't like him. I am sure they couldn't care less about what he did.
He could have saved their own children from a burning hospital and they would still ban him if people just didn't like the guy for some reason.
Now that Bitcoin exists, they need all the PR they can get to keep their customers.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:53:53
They would have tens of thousands of dollars worth locked up with the DAO that they would have to wait months before they can unlock.
If they are found to do anything at all, that DAO doesn't like, including asking for ID suspiciously too much, they could lose far more then what they could possibly gain.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:04:31
The idea is that it is decentralized. The risks are far smaller then having a singe entity of high value. It is a lot easier for a single company to do so (and they have to do it as well) then for a single individual to do these things.
The risk is divided into compartments, just like oil is during transport. There is no single point of failure.
Is it perfect? God no and neither is Bitcoin or anything else in this World. But just because perfect privacy isn't possible (and it absolutely isn't), doesn't mean that you should walk into a police station and give them everything you have without any effort on their behalf.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:55:41
Disputes are rare, arbitrators rarely need to get involved.
Proofs are often done with a tool called PageSigner or other tamper-proof options, so there isn't any reason to ever rely on trust in someone's word.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:40:04
The World ends, of course.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:05:15
Or you could buy Bitcoin on Bisq with no KYC and swap it for Monero if you wish with no KYC. All from the comfort of Bisq.
PS: Monero community loves Bisq, they are most of the volume there. Especially since ShapeShift got all KYC and stuff.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:46:02
Might as well just ban everyone and force them all to use Bitcoin only.
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:06:41
It is literally as easy as downloading Bitcoin Core, the most secure and reliable software wallet that you can have. There is not more to it.
I would assume that most people have 200GB to spare, but if not, running a pruned node is just fine as well.
Extra points to those that install Tor and run Bitcoin Core with -listenonion option.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:11:44
Not really if they use Tor hidden services. That is another neat thing about Tor, it is not only anonymous, censorship resistant, but it also bypasses firewalls.
You can host a site on your PC (or a node) and never need to touch your routers configurations.
Of course, it helps having some ports open on the clearnet as well. But I think Tor is just a more sophisticated solution.
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:02:11
Exactly, it is not about him as an individual, no one cares about that.
The problem is in the method to censor people.
Today it is him for this, tomorrow it is you or your children for something else.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:11:22
Who cares what he promotes. You can't ban persons right for financial freedom over him saying something that you don't like.

This is currently the weakest part of Bisq, due to DAO not being implemented yet, but that should be finished very soon. With the DAO, anybody could be an arbitrator if they bond a lot of tokens in a decentralized manner.
Arbitrators have no need nor incentive to store any ID data. They don't really have a need to ask for it either, most of the time. Although things rarely ever need arbitration, let along ID, in those scenarios you just need to show your ID to the arbitrator once and you can choose not to ever use that arbitrator again or simply create a new onion address. There is no need for arbitrator to store it after dispute is over.
There are 2 arbitrators at the moment, but I assume very soon we will have many more that speak other languages and etc.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:55:51
Yes, but Bisq has no ads. It is an open source project, no company behind it, no ICOs or anything, just code.
It is a chicken-and-egg problem as you know. These users promoting it here are the ones that really want to see that change, hence the posts.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:57:57
And also it allows for censorship resistance.
You can't block traffic that you don't know where it's going and what it is.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:54:24
I wouldn't called it shilled :D Bisq isn't a company, it is just an open source project. People who promote it are simply the same people that complain about the trade volume. They want more people to use it so that they don't have this drawback.
It isn't that anything is broken. Bisq has been working great and it is increasing in volume a lot, especially by Monero community. It is just fully decentralized, as a network and as a project, so there is no one to promote it as no one is paid for it. Other exchanges spend millions on ads, Bisq spends nothing. It is a word of mouth game, which you are experiencing right now.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:51:46
I like that we are debating this, like they are mutually exclusive.
Having both is the best idea :)
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:59:12
That is how [Bisq]( does it.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:57:17
Yeah, F2F is my new favourite as well. I am quite excited to see how it will get adopted.
I always thought it would be the best to do the exchange somewhere where there are cameras and where there is a chance that they will give you footage if you ask them (or give them a bit of a tip). So near a local store or a local exchange office or something.
It gives a buyer a possibility to prove (or at least potentially prove) that he gave the cash. That should discourage fraud in most cases.
Also since you will be trading F2F locally, you will likely get to know everyone you are trading with, so you don't need to risk with other trader's offers.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:30:10
I can post links, but I am not sure if that is prohibited. I can PM you if you wish.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:38:45
I have no idea. You can try it out, but using Tor to retain your privacy should be advised. In Bisq, Tor is used automatically, you can't trade without it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:36:52
Very interesting story to read, but ASICs produce a lot of heat. You can't cool down a planet this way, so there is nothing to worry about.
Still enjoyed the story quite a bit :)

That is most likely the case, yes.

Value is subjective and arbitrary. It has value to him and he wants it back. It is his right to do so.
"Engineers" don't earn 2k/day, that is just nonsense.
People shouldn't be sorted by financial priority, but by what is right and what is wrong. The fact that banks (and now central exchanges that are practically the same) made us use to being seen in dollar bills and not as human beings is exactly the problem that Bitcoin is here trying to fight.
NDAs are not needed to return people their money. That is just nonsense that they are trying to pull so that he can't complain without them suing him. This is just how disgusting these big f*cking companies are.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:10:29
The man simply wants what he is owed.
It is about principle, I wouldn't look over a dollar if someone tried to fuck me over like that. Fuck Poloniex.
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:17:22
Exactly. Don't trust them, they already showed that they have no problem with ignoring moral values.
@_date: 2018-10-27 09:30:37
I've read it. This is why I know it was 2 weeks only.
That money is somewhere, trust me they didn't just lose all the coins that users had bought through their platform. If they ever had it, they sold them, probably before they even announced that they will delist them. This is a fractional reserve s*it that OP is talking about.
Centralized exchanges are no better then f*cking banks. Couldn't care less about anything else then making money, any way that they can, even if it means doing shady scams like this.
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:15:43
Holding your rightful funds hostage is very immoral at least, I don't know about law, but it is horrible of them to treat people like that. There are a lot of practices like this done by banks and centralized exchanges are even worse.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:20:42
I doubt that someone would go through all this trouble for $25.
I would for the principle, since I wouldn't stand for someone to do me over like that, let along a big greedy company, so I understand either way.
it is definitely worth the legal fees.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:15:43
Maybe he was AFK, on holiday or something. They made an arbitrary time frame, if they have his coins (which they probably sold and took as a profit before even announcing it) they owe him to return him those.
Who do they think they are just to tell you "oh btw you have 2 weeks to withdraw or we will be taking your money (ps: f.u.)"
Just because you didn't have a problem, doesn't mean that many others didn't. It is called selective scamming.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:16:08
They are all scammy. Some are just sloppy.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:12:17
Tiny bags add up when you do selective scamming like that for years.
OP deserves what he is owed.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:04:43
So if you were going to delist these tokens, why didn't you sell all of them before you delisted them so that users could get their money back or reserved these tokens so they can withdraw them directly? Not everyone can attend your website every week to see what is going on with their money.
If you hold the coins, then it is your responsibility to give the users back their coins or private keys. I doubt that Polinex simply lost all the money that these users had in their coins, more likely explanation is that you simply sold all the coins before you delisted them (probably before you even announced it) and took it as profit when users didn't request their money back in arbitrary time limit that you set.
Please stop with these lies and greedy manipulations. You couldn't care less about anything other then making few bucks any way you can, this is what companies are all about. You know that you owe this man money and you obviously couldn't care less, since you never replied until you had no other choice.
This is why I will never use a centralized exchange.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:18:23
I wouldn't give too much optimism to other centralized exchanges. Even well meaning ones are forced to play the game sometimes.
Just look at ShapeShift. They would never do KYC in a million years, that was their whole point, but they have to now. It is though when you are under government's mercy.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:42:55
There are actually two arbitrators. One is the co-founder of the exchange and there were no real complaints about the arbitrators.
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:22:48
I know, I understand the issue you are having with this document, as I did when you first created the post on Bisq's subreddit. I simply can't do nothing about that other than point you in the right direction on where to express your issue in order to get a better chance on solving it quicker.
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:46:31
Chargebacks will unfortunately always be possible in any fiat payment.
Bisq choses to add only payment methods that are really hard to reverse like SEPA.
There was only one chargeback in currently supported payment methods and that was due to misunderstanding. It happened with Zelle (US payment method) and there was no chargebacks with SEPA to this day even though it is most widely used payment method in Bisq.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:58:14
It is in the app under Account-&gt;Arbitrator selection. These things change as the project matures, so there is no website that states this specifically, since it will likely change in relatively near future, especially when the DAO launches.
I know you didn't complain about the arbitrators, it is just a reply to your statement about no oversight. As for calling an open source P2P software a centralized exchange, I had nothing to add to that.
I never said it isn't an issue, I even advised you how to get a response from the devs quicker, since they don't visit reddit much. I assume when the document is written they tried explaining the most general complicated case, since every dispute is different and they obviously don't need to ask for ID for every (maybe even any) trade.
As for you constantly pointing out that I am not restoring you confidence, that was never my intention in the first place, that is completely up to you. This is exactly why your statement that I am defending my emotional investment is quite untrue, I really don't mind if you don't have the confidence in the project, you are a free man, do as you wish, Bisq is just a code that you can use if you want.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:44:08
Support is usually done on the forum at 
If you need to resync the balance, you can just delete the SPV chain file in the Settings and restart twice.
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:42:23
You don't need to keep your client running during a trade, just while your offer is available to be taken. Closing your client will make that offer temporarily unavailable until you open Bisq again.
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:49:14
Well it is a P2P network that most of the times doesn't even contact mediators.
It is a little more complicated than that though. Funds are locked in 2-of-3 multisig during trades, where mediators have the same amount of power as other 2 peers, so it isn't easy to not call Bisq P2P.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:57:51
Limit doesn't really impact how much you can trade. It is just per single trade, you would naturally have multiple offers setup at once for larger amounts.
You can trade as much as you want on Bisq. That per trade limit is for security reasons only.
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:15:19
I meant another implementation of Bisq, just like we have multiple Bitcoin implementations. That would put us all on a same network.
I have my doubts that any company can bring a decentralized solution. If nothing, they will have development centralized or non-free software.
@_date: 2018-11-07 21:52:56
I personally would like to see python implementation, but sure, whatever people want, more the better.
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:50:19
I'm not saying it ain't useful to some people. Day traders will always prefer centralized exchanges for speed, if nothing else.
I am just saying that for those that care about privacy, security and censorship-resistance, decentralization is often a way to go, at least in Bisq's case.
If development is centralized, that gives governments an easy target to force some kind of KYC or some intentional data leakage. I know that companies have shown that they will do just about anything that government asks them to do. The bigger they are, the more they have to lose, so nicer they are to the government, which is the only actor that can shut them down at a certain scale.
I am not saying that there will be no privacy on that company's solution, I am just saying that my doubts about it are probably well justified.
You think they will use Tor exclusively and no one single entity will have access to your personal information? I honestly wonder.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:02:12
I am not sure if that figure is correct, but volume is quite volatile from day to day, since it is still young.
Last week there were days when there were half a million USD passed in a day.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:07:49
VPN hardly do anything for your privacy. They were not designed to hide your identity, they have more of a system administration purpose.
Total anonymity is a myth, that doesn't exist. You can use Tor and that is about best you can get these days, if and only if, your system is secure.
Security is higher with decentralization. You don't have a single point of failure, you don't have a single entity that can introduce a backdoor or get their servers hacked, data stolen on the entire network.
Neither of us can claim how private is the system that doesn't even exist yet, but what we can both agree is that it can be very bad and we can just wait and see.
Censorship-resistance is maybe not important for you, but it is very important to a lot of people. If you want to learn and start using some trading software, if you are going to invest time and effort in learning and getting used to it just to be shut down by some politicians because they are not getting big enough bribe from it, then censorship-resistance can be quite useful.
When I use Bitcoin, I know it is here to last and that no one can take it away from me. Can there be other Bitcoin like cryptocurrencies that would be just as good, sure, but I already learned how Bitcoin works, people have already spent time reviewing it, it has reputation, if it could be just shut down, even if I keep my money, I would still have lost all the time I spent learning and getting used to this already very useful system.
Same goes for other decentralized, censorship-resistant, private and secure software. There are many benefits of such, some people might not care about, but we can all see that plenty of us do.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:56:37
The limit is per trade only. You can put up as many trades at once as you want.
This is just a security feature.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:00:14
It is just there to make it less attractive for scammers, since they can't do much harm at once with a single bank account. The limit is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:54:09
It would be cool if someone did some other implementation in another language.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:55:37
Yeah, devs want to switch to Bitcoin Core to use as a wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:35:05
Bisq is open source. If devs introduced something that lowers privacy, people could just change the code or run the old one. This really isn't generally a problem with open source projects.
Just like you can't pressure single Bitcoin Core dev into introducing malware into Bitcoin, since many people would notice and fork.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:28:04
It's also quite harder to stop something that doesn't exist in physical world.
It is a lot harder to stop information than a physical substance.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:09:26
It is just a bit different from centralized exchanges since you need to send the altcoins or fiat directly to the other trader once the trade starts instead of depositing it into a centralized exchange first.
It is kinda like an exchange with no memory, use it for 1 or 100 trades, similar process, just need to do it 99 times more.
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:52:01
I am sorry if I wasn't clear enough, but I don't agree with you that Bisq has essentially zero liquidity. Token is used to fund , a so far successful, effort to increase liquidity on the Bisq network. So I don't agree that this can only be solved by it becoming centralized either.
Also arbitrators aren't unheard of, it just takes time for everyone to build their trust in them, as many users already did. There are also efforts with the DAO that will remove need to trust arbitrators even further than it already is. This is the main reason why DAO is being developed in the first place.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:18:40
I wouldn't agree with you.
Bisq generated a lot more liquidity and offers in last few months.
There has been organized efforts by the team to encourage people to make offers by offering rewards in a future colored Bitcoin token called BSQ that will be the base of a future Bisq DAO.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:09:40
That is true. Kinda hard for them to do that for every trader, just like with torrents, but I do understand the increased risks.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:07:05
True. I guess Bisq devs just didn't see it fit in with the security Bisq usually provides for other payment methods so they didn't want users to confuse it and assume that they are just as secure.
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:58:59
Well, I don't know. I assume they can see that as suspicious, but it is hard to prove that they exchanged cryptocurrencies on Bisq, but I do understand your worry.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:19:25
I assume governments pressured them to add KYC, since they will probably lose traders over this and they probably knew it.
Bisq team is constantly looking at payment methods and chargeback risk they offer. They wouldn't add a payment method that offers a high chargeback risk, like PayPal or credit cards, but I do understand your worries.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:24:48
Cash trades are hard to prove so there is no benefit arbitrator system of Bisq can help with this. Only thing that could be added is like a separate market in the same app that simply lists offers posted by people in P2P manner, but doesn't provide any security with multisigs that it usually does.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:21:51
We already have teams building and running decentralized P2P alternatives such as Bisq over Tor. You can check it out here: 
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:10:09
There are few video tutorials here:
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:19:35
You might be happier with a decentralized exchange like Bisq instead.
They will never be able to ask you for KYC, it is an open source P2P exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:40:35
If this happened Bisq would simply change the dev team. Might be dead for a while if there are no devs interested, but I think that is unlikely for such an important project. There really isn't much governments could achieve by capturing few developers in an open source project.
These trading fees are only there for spam reasons right now, as they are too small to bring any real funding. Bisq already has 25BTC it never spent that it received as a donation few years ago. Right now devs are focused on making a DAO and these 25 BTC would be basis for a colored Bitcoin token called BSQ that will be used by this DAO.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:14:08
I don't think there is a reason to assume that DEX are somehow less intuitive by nature. They are kinda more natural and similar to trading in the real world.
Generally you buy stuff from different places depending on who sells what, so it is kinda decentralized.
There isn't really anything in Bisq that needs to be less intuitive, it is just that it is a bit different if you are already used to centralized exchanges where you deposit your funds first and then trade, here you need to send it directly to other trader once you have started the trade.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:05:47
Not really, that was just for buying BTC with USD, there are currently a lot more people selling BTC on Bisq, with more than 0.5 BTC in offers for it, some of which are bellow the market price, giving USD market a negative spread, so quite an opportunity to earn a profit trading in Bisq.
Offers get taken all the time, truth is that people don't make offers if they see that someone is offering a better one or when they can just take someone else's. It is very rare that you can't buy or sell BTC with USD very quickly in Bisq, there are enough Bisq users for that.
What problems on the fiat side are you referring to? They seem to increase liquidity very effectively.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:26:51
It is quite hard in general for banks to know if you are using a P2P exchange, since you are trading with other random traders just like you. They can't really know if these people are your friends that you are sending money to.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:29:51
They are still just a centralized website, sooner or later they might force them to do KYC as well.
Decentralized P2P exchanges like Bisq are most censorship resistant and private.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:10:52
Yeah. Devs are working on it currently. It is all improvable.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:31:41

I am afraid they will make it impose KYC as well one day.
Bisq seems like a better option, as it is a decentralized P2P exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:49:39
Reputation really isn't implemented in Bisq yet, if it ever will, since in is decentalized. The protection is intended to be a security deposit locked in 2-of-3 multisig with a chosen arbitrator.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:36:47
Well Bisq has security deposits left in a 2of3 multisig with a selected arbitrator.  That is the point of it, to increase the security of P2P exchanges. Besides, it operates usually across the border, not just a city. You don't need to meet in person, you can send it using SEPA,ClearXChange,OKPay and etc.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:58:48
You just list the details in a certain pinned topic on Bisq forum and make a pull request for address validation. Altcoins really don't get declined to be added in Bisq. Most of the Altcoins that requested to be added are the ones that didn't make a pull request and you can't really expect for a project to add thousands of Altcoins just when someone asks and isn't willing to do the work for their own coin to be added.
