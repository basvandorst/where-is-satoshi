This.  The stock market going up IS the crash.  Fascinating times we are living in.

Today was a really REALLY shitty day.   The fear is off the charts and should be a reminder to all of us why hodling is the only way for the vast majority of us.  Nobody expected a 3-14k run, then a 14-7k plunge.  The only way to win is not to play.
The miners will sell to cover their S17s and flush out the weaker operations eventually.  Then they will hoard after the halving, sell every now and then to cover operational expenses and we'll do this all over again.

Lost me too. Beware folks.  Someone who does not know the difference between strait and straight and their and there is unlikely to be a master of much of anything.

I guess I now know what an idiot will do with one bitcoin.

This had to be said.  Emotional Discipline is the name of the BTC game.  That's the enchilada right there.
Regrettably, it's also the hardest skill to learn.  Up or down.

Sorry, yeah cash app.  No fees but they do have a bit of a price premium.

You do not know this for certain.  Nobody knows who holds bitcoin, how affluent they are, or how they would allocate their resources in the next recession.  
I would argue very few poor people own bitcoin.  Those that are poor and holding certainly don't hold enough to tank the market.

Stop looking for someone to provide you with a prediction in the first place, because it's impossible to know the future.  Stop holding unrealistic expectations on people like Tom Lee.  He has some decent insights into bitcoin valuations based on demographic shifts and we will see how it plays out. 
Let's leave it at that.

Anyone who claims they got rich in crypto without getting burned is probably lying.  Holding a large amount of BTC is hard.  Very hard.
@_date: 2019-10-18 00:33:44
The only correct statement is that nobody knows.  Bitcoin has never existed during a recession.  It's all speculation at this point.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:26:12
We're still in a downtrend folks.

I've thought a lot about the opportunity level argument.  To me, it's largely unchanged.  While yes, you do need a serious amount of capital to substantially come out ahead in Bitcoin today, it is an entirely different market than say 2012.  You would have to be quite a badass to put in substantial capital in those days, so I see the opportunity as relatively static.  Gone are the days of accidental millionaires who bought BTC to buy weed on Silk road and forgot about it, or dabbled in it with their PC and recovered an old hard drive.  That's how I discovered it, a co-worker mined 7500btc for a cryptography class project in college and dumped it all at $100 and bought a house.  
I bet the majority of retail investors bought at 200 and sold way before we arrived at current values.

It's currently $9025.
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:47:52
Agreed, and the next target will be the 21 weekly EMA.  If bitcoin can close above that, I suspect smart money will be going balls deep in BTC again.  Until then, I'm watching.

QC unravels everything.  Worrying about it is as pointless as it was worrying about y2k.

Pumps are often harder to deal with emotionally than dumps.  Everyone has their calculators out right now.
A lot of people made a lot of money today, including me.  I'm ready to lose it all tomorrow. HODLing is only going to get harder the higher it gets, not easier.
Calculators come out, dreams become possible, expectations get set.  The 2018 bear market is a cakewalk compared to a bitcoin bull market.  Bull markets are what we all should be afraid of, otherwise, you will get shaken out.

Coinbase is fine, the fees aren't an issue unless you are a trader.  If you are buying and holding, it's a solid reliable option.  Personally, If I'm buying a small amount, like $1000, I tend to use Square so I can send it to my hardware wallet right away.  Large amounts, I use Coinbase.

I love this thread.   It's amazing how your perception changes when you escape inflation.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:01:30
This is why it gets exponentially harder to hold as the price increases.  I've been through that very scenario you described.  It sucks, a lot.

For me, it's just experience.  The  thing you have to learn is how to be content with your position.  To battle the emotions, I have a plan and I stick to it.  I don't trade and I only add to my position on 30-40% dips below 10k.  The hardest thing for me to deal with is the moves higher.
