You're talking as if most crypto's haven't already solved this issue...
bitcoin is shit tech compared to many other cryptos. It is just being hyped because of mainstream.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:38:30
while paying for everything with USD. amirite
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:45:33
You sound like someone who likes to hear himself talk, a lot.


If you really are so blind to see that the tech behind bitcoin is actually really not very interesting + way behind many other crypto's I'm afraid you're the literal buffoon.
People are not buying bitcoin for its superior tech, performance or use cases. Only to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:15:37
such great technology wow
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:50:04


It was already pretty obvious most people don't actually care about the glaring issues that bitcoin has to become an actual useful crypto
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:59:21
Surr, but i was mostly pointing to the sentiment that most people are only buying btc to increase their fiat later on.

Having saved 200k and already having a house, then I think it is!  Assuming he has been working for 6 years that means he saved 33k per year which is pretty much the average yearly income in europe.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:34:43
and wait for a few hours in the store while your tx gets confirmed? not gonna happen in its current form.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:18:05
Aha I see.  In europe making 120k/year (or even 90k) before taxes is  considered being extremely well off. Average monthly wage in belgium is 40k $ before taxes (which is like 25k $ after taxes). So I guess they really are not really comparable, unless you consider yourself rich for US terms
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:54:45
oh yeah I didn't think about it being combined income.  However its hard to compare US income to europe anyway. Half of my income goes to tax :).  
What I don't get: if you can save up so much money (lets say after 5 years you have 500K+) , why not just retire and live off of that money in southeast asia?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:50:02
buy the top, sell the bottom?
why not just wait a bit and leverage on finex?  You pretty much lost it all already, so why throw it in the trash?
We're near the bottom, and we all know a huge fomo rally is coming up... 
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:00:32
Lol.  I just hope for you uncle benji doesn't decide to drop the price to 200$ again :)
Most here are being played by the whales. You can ofcourse make a quick buck if you play along with them.
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:43:01
damn thats alot of money for a 27yo. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:06:02
RemindMe! 1 week
to have a good laugh
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:10:39
thanks for the good laugh
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:07:59
But the price was currently riding on this news. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:50:51
No, but selling a week ago was the better choice. If you hold now for another year i think its realistic you're in red, while u had the perfect opportunity to sell and buy back lower.
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:02:29
For anyone who actually believes this hopium:  there is no harm in selling now, there is no reason the price would actually rally up, so you won't miss anything. Take profits and wait what the real result will be. this whole "HODL" is just stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:03:18
yeah I'm pretty sure you're the idiot here. Keep chanting he will not divide us while you are actually doing the dividing yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:06:52
i lol'ed
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:48:20
you realize you can recover files even after a drive has been formatted right? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:56:46
LMAO your "HODL" post history is so hilarious. Literally none of his HODL posts are in profit
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:39:39
just imagine if you didn't "HODL" at 20k lmao.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:16:21
you should probably have sold at 20k, 16k, 12k, 10k
there's not too much downside left now. 3-4k is possible but it would rebound pretty fast.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:16:30


Eh, in what way is bitcoin more suited for this purpose than many others that can also do this?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:42:59
you going to continue holding all the way to 0?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:20:52
Right now BTC is being pumped because of great returns. (Which is great!). 
Sadly, this has nothing to do with actual use cases or adoption. There are a lot of altcoins that have more promising technology &amp; use cases behind it.
At a certain point people will realize this, so on a long enough timeline, I think btc will drop to zero. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:09:22
Wash trades....
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:08:11
they are taking advantage of the "new technology".  Meaning blockchain.
Bitcoin really is the least impressive part of it all. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:13:58
This transaction alone totally justifies the 10k$/btc price
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:37:53
More like 10k 20k 16k 10k 8k 6k 6k 6k 8k 10k 6k 6k 6k 8k
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:03:56
hmm I guess 2 days was enough
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:58:35
!RemindMe 2 weeks

It can also crash 50%
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:29:53
Holy delusional batman
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:19:48
Good point. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:30:18
Well, as of right now i COULD afford to lose it, ofcourse its alot of money to lose. I have a steady income, and currently no expenses.
Ofcourse it would suck to lose the money I've saved for 5 years :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:18:00
Why would you suggest mtgox if you are rich?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:26:22
What's the best way to get bitcoins fast? I was looking into Bitstamp, but it might take 1-3 days for the deposit to get through?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:30:26
Yeah, that's kind of the point isn't it :) right now it does look like the market will keep on rising for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:15:46
I doubt it. I'm no expert whatsoever though.
My guess is it will keep dropping to ~10$, and the bubble will start all over again. It might reach 200$ again.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:40
Did you buy them at 260? Did you put more money in than you can afford to lose?
