That reminds me, we should make Bitcoin offshore tax havens. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:36:48
Wait if someone does acquire them, do they get the 200k BTC? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:22:41
Their reply tells us all we need to know. They are afraid of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:55:54
That is also a solid thought. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:48:38
Great post. Still all of this falls in water when there comes quantum computers. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:53:34
Well he was robbed one, and then for a second time two months later. I think this second time is partially his fault. I mean if it happened to you once do everything to protect your computer it's not that hard, there is a lot of people around here talking how to protect yourself. Also if he had any doubt that his computer might be compromised in any way he should have acted. Think the second time could be avoided if he just payed a little more attention.

Even though I don't own Apple products I think this is a low move on their side. Even though I know they are only after profits, customers wishes should be at least sometimes heard. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:14:28
Thank you very much! 
Wish you a happy new year! Hope all your dreams come true.
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:07:42
As always I am late for this kind of stuff. Still it's nice someone is doing this. Btw what are you getting payed for?
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:57:14
If I had that many I would move away right now. I wish you all the best! Hope you have a great and adventurous experience. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 09:45:06
Really doesn't make any sense what they are doing. Like they couldn't store those bitcoins somewhere and make a database of current users and their bitcoins and just redistribute them to new wallets. Even if it takes a day or two it would be better option then this. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:52:12
I hope to get 1 btc by the end of the next month. Who knows maybe I do manage it. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:06:53
This is a scam site. Probably one that distributes viruses. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:56:11
Well this shows the ones that are lost. Ones at the beginning. That is interesting.
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:42:22
I wish I had some money to liberate them from people who don't want them. Sweet bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:49:01
Pools with less hash-rate might be a better solution. Since that way you can be sure it's not something government has come up with or some greedy individual.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:58:33
Well you can't blame Gox. 
The sight of two gentlemen peacefully protesting with laptops and a webcam would create such a disturbance and riots in the streets that Gox would have to pack up everything and move to a new location.
Karpeles needs to get his fat ass kicked.
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:00:25
Well it seems profitable so he doesn't want it to be known, just like regular mobster.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:44:08
Hope your volume will increase, that would make you even bigger. Glad to hear there is someone out there more costumer orientated. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:50:14
There still might be a way to recover it. Ask around. It's not over yet, just try not to save too much data on your computer since that can overwrite the part where the .data file was. Best would be to plug out your hard drive and give it to someone to recover it for you.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:14:23
Either way they'll have to do that, maybe not all of those things but most so that they can pay their debts. That is the sad part really. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:39:11
I'll bet you that as well. So can you just give me $5,000 since it's a draw. :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:33:14
I love this idea. It shows strength of bitcoin and how it can be used for good, since a lot of people just want to show it as something bad. 
Just one question can we post more then one artwork for this?
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:05:55
Thanks for the tip. 
Okey then. Looking forward to this contest! 
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:30:41
So they can't use their own money? That's what I am reading. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:52:18
I had same problem. In the end I gave up on it once I realized how complicated they made something so simple. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:16:53
Thanks! This is a great incentive to work more on this. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:34:23
Well I just think that litecoins might be worth something one day, bitcoin wasn't worth that much a year ago. Mining them now is possible. That is what I am telling. Mining BTC on the other hand is not possible for me due to large difficulty rate. Just thinking a little bit ahead. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:12:47
Well that's a bummer. They lost about 46,000 USD. 
Hope they will invest more into their security next time. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:07:03
OK here is one example. Just different colors. [Color 1]( [Color 2]( and similar [Color 3]( if there is some other color you would like to see him feel free to tell me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:18:25
Well you wouldn't be able to buy any coins in 2008 since they didn't exist, you could have mined some in January of 2009 though. Not to worry we all regret for not having at least 100 BTC we forgot about.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:21:26
This should definitely become a thing. Why talk in BTC when they are rarely used. It's like if you have a 1000$ bill how often will you use it. This should have become a thing as soon as BTC went above 500$ mark.
Long live mBTC! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:11:05
I understood you perfectly. Just sooner or later bitcoin is going to stop growing. Now it is constantly growing since media is covering it non stop. Everything has it's limits. I am just saying that I will look at alternatives.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:02:57
For instance [this]( but it can be found even cheaper. This one is more expansive because you can buy just one. 
Edit: [This]( is great. Too bad minimal order is 80. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:52:58
Thanks to all for the advice!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:10:38
Explaining them won't do you much good. Had similar problem in the end I gave up on it and went to mine altcoins. You can then keep them or exchange them for BTC without much trouble. Then again there is still a problem of getting BTC back to USD. It's not easy. When I think how much I tried to get some bitcoins and couldn't it really became frustrating and irritating, even now I have about 0.00001 it's not easy but don't give up.  
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:10:59
Here are two more. These one have more of cartoon feel to them. One is even hand drawn for the most part. 
[Girl Witch](
[Wizard 4](
Hope I am not too late with this...
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:35:32
Well I just don't think that one currency can survive in this world. Just one. We know now that BTC is one of them, but what will be others. That is what I want to know. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:10:58
If I remember correctly they chose based on fee they get. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:31:00
Europe. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:25:37
I can't access it for some reason. Hope they will fix that soon.
P.S. If it did ask for Java to be run then it was definitely hacked with a java drive by. Hope no one got in their net. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:56:47
Well too bad there isn't something like this in my town. It would be treasure hunt! :D
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:08:18
Yeah it is great. It's no wonder since your transaction should be handled by miners and their power is over 10000  PetaFLOPs/s
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:44:35
Well they should definitely increase it a lot. Solve the problem for the future, that way they won't have to increase it again in say a year or two. Machines used for mining are amazing they can handle it without a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:36:08
Ok will do. Oh this was just a simple edit. I intend to make it from the ground up. It's just I won't have Photoshop available for a few days, but when I do I'll do a lot better. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:49:25
Well now since it has hit 1000$ I would sell it. Then wait till it gets lower, buy some again just in case. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:44:43
I did google just didn't find anything that useful. That is why I asked. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:20:04
No, that is the statement of their equivalent of central bank, that is People's Bank of China [PBOC]( They are the ones who decide the rules there, that is why I thought this was important. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:03:09
My mistake then. I know that larger transactions go fast trough miners but they also get a small incentive from it. That is why they are done fast. For smaller transaction I am not sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:15:27
Finally. Didn't know it was there. I looked for it before but couldn't find it. Since it keept showing that my balance was 0.00 but in fact it was 0.00006999.
I know it's not much, but you have what you have. It's sad to be honest. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:45:15
Since I haven't see any female wizard that is [witch]( and a [happy wizard](
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:39:28
I understand all of that. Simply I want to know what other alternatives are there and why you think they will succeed. Like in real world there is more then one currency, some are stronger some are weaker, but people don't like being tied to one thing only. That is why I want to know alternatives. Take bitcoin a year ago. No one could say with accuracy that it will grow this much in just a year. That is the beauty of it.
Your answer is most informative so far. Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:24:48
Yes I would like to make a homemade usb miner. That is what I was looking for. Since the parts are not expensive. All you need really is schematics to make them work properly. I don't mean to spend thausands of dollars on equipment. I already have basic ones. Know a little bit of electronics also have friends who are electronic engineers so they would help if needed. Just thought someone wrote a guide on how to make one. You have to start somewhere. Make a test one, get it to work then make a better one and so on.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:48:13
Like always I am late for the show...hehe
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:06:07
How come you only have one customer review if it's first in your category. That would mean not many books are sold by my account.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:47:33
Nice. Also no fight is a plus!
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:50:30
I plan on mining some alt coins in the beginning. Nothing special. Just a hobby. 
Well don't think it would since parts are so cheap. Order them from China and you can get them for next to nothing. Yes they have to be bought in bulk but when you know someone who is buying something in bigger quantities you can get a few that will be included in that order. So it wouldn't be too much money. You would have to buy components for at least 5 I think lower than that would not be possible. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:59:26
[Here is mine.]( 
Hope this contest lasts at least till the new year since I only have my laptop and no access to Photoshop to do something better. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:00:01
OOOOOO! My bad. I saw it as 39.917, not 39,917.xxx 
You are right!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:13:39
Oh I have checked. It is true you are first in your category. It was just weird to that you have just one review so I had to ask. 
Wish you all the best with your book still.
P.S. Use mega, dropbox or mediafire to host your book when you decide to give it for free, beacuse if you decide to delete it in the future you'll have full control over it.
