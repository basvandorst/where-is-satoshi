It is definitely the only option as far as fundgibility is concerned. A central exchanges can be regulated to censor or lock down Bitcoin by chain analysis. If someone in the chain bought drugs with your Bitcoin it will be locked on the exchange. Leading to higher prices for Bitcoin without a history (fresh mined). Without Bisq Bitcoin is worthless.
So please use Bisq or Monero.

With a Bitcoin fork you always have the problem that the price stagnates for a long time. People sell their free BCH over a long period of time. If there is a larger purchase, or if the tax is due. Unless there's some revolutionary innovation in that fork. If you want to speculate, then maybe you can start again at a price of 100 USD. BCH is nothing more than Litecoin.

Not using Bisq is a big risk for Bitcoins fungibility. Exchanges could start to check for (drug money, scam, etc..). This could lead to higher prices for freshly minted Bitcoin and  it could inflate by every transaction made.

Not every altcoin uses sha256. You can't just turn your ASIC miner into a weapon if the altcoin uses a different algorithm. Monero for example uses RandomX. RandomX is minable with a CPU - because it is hard to do shortcuts on the hardware. Modern CPU's return the best results on RandomX, because the task is random.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:36:34
A lot of changes where made to protect against charge back scammer. Fiat money is always a bit risky. Even cash - could be counterfeilt. 
Those charge back hacks are not so trivial and hard to do in a big scale now. The Cracker needs a hacked online banking account - to pull this off. Now you get a time lock to do larger trades. The hacker wont sacrifice his hacked online account for an 50$ trade. The more time passes by the higher the chance this is gonna blow.
Also arbitration has changed. Arbitration is only done if the shit hits the fan - now. There's a learning effect.

Some people want privacy, some want a very fast transaction etc. pp. Bitcoin couldn't handle the complete world population. Not even BCH with a giant block size could do that. We need diversity to scale in size - in a decentralised world. Bitcoin is a tiny database. If every person on earth would open a lightning channel it would take 30 years. No joke.
Don't get me wrong. Bitcoin is perfect for its job. As a store of value and very safe. If I had a few million, I would keep it there protected against inflation. At some point you trade oil and other resources only in Bitcoin and no longer in USD but you can't use Bitcoin for all use cases.

You are correct, but it depends on how you define the internet. Is it the hardware? 
* Ethernet(cat 5, cat 6, cat 7),
* FDDI(fiber),
*  IEEE 802.11(wifi), 
*  PPP, 
* L2TP,
*  BOOTP.
  **&lt;- choose what fits best for you.**
Is it the protocol (Layer3):
* IP (Internet Protocol)
* IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)
*  IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
* EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
* OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)
* BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
* RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
Transportprotocol (Layer4):
* TCP
* UDP
* SCTP
* TLS
It is diversity that makes the internet work how it works today.

Bitcoin is a protection against inflation and could become the reserve currency with the lowest adoption but highest market cap. Wealth is not distributed evenly.

Bitcoin could become the reserve currency of the world - but it will never be a world dominating currency with a giant block size - forcing everyone to use it. That doesn't make any sense, because blockchain scales best by diversity. Altcoins are legit to my opinion. Bitcoin's marketcap domination could be at 70-80% even if only 1% of the world population use it, because wealth is not distributed evenly.

Yes it is that bad but still the high networth individuals will stick with Bitcoin until it grows to a size where privacy and fungibility will become important. Then Monero will become a strong partner with Bitcoin. Remember: It is all about diversity. No one wants a world dominating crypto currency with giant block size.

Bitcoin is lost to the masses. If you compare it to an operating system. Windows is used by 80% even though it spies on it's users. I still like Bitcoin(Windows) but i do focus on Monero(Linux), because it turns out to be the better coin. But do NOT think for a minute that Monero will out perform Bitcoin as an asset. Monero will be the nerd coin with features the Bitcoin community can only dream of.  If you are bothered by ASIC mining then hold a little of both and use Monero to do buisness.

The Fiat side can always be tainted on a decentralised exchange. Even if you trade in cash. It could be counterfeit money.
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:32:41
Mass adoption:
1) Will most probably lead to fractional reserve banking. First they print a Dollar backed by Bitcoin :). 10 years later they will remove "In math we trust" by "In god we trust" on the dollar bill and start printing again.
2) Bitcoins lack of fungibility will create two kind of Bitcoin - the "dirty Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin". Exchanges will deny the dirty Bitcoin. A "tainted" or "dirty" Bitcoin is a Bitcoin with a bad history e.G. Binance hack, drug dealer etc.  Maybe forensic and chain analysis will be build in by default in every wallet - some centralised company now knows every move you make.
3) High net worth individuals don't care about 1) and 2) because they can also afford good forensic and never heard of "Not your key not your Bitcoin". So Bitcoin dominance will rise to 80% totally crippled and losing its revolutionary character.
4) Nerds will still be using Monero the way it is supposed to work. Same distribution like e.G. Windows and Linux.
End of story.  It's just my personal experience with people.

Don't confuse privacy with fungibility. If you can't sell a Bitcoin with a bad history on a large exchange - users will double check on the history. Probably you  wont be able to buy any zkSnarks coins or Monero. Not until the day 90% of traders use a DEX.
P.S. Monero uses crypto that has proven itself. Not like zerocoin and or zcash. zerocoin protocol failed. &lt;- Needs to be fixed. Also Monero has the highest nerd factor. Devs understand the unix philosophy. Nerds will probably use Monero on some bash shell long after Bitcoin ceased to exist.

Try Bisq. Bisq is a decentralised exchange with a custodial wallet. You can also sell and buy Bitcoin for fiat money with other Bisq users. No middle man. Dont forget to close your account on the centralised exchange (Registered letter "Cancellation") . So they can not sell your data that easy.

To be honest. Without Bisq the fungibility of Bitcoin would not be given. Suppose the major exchanges are regulated and would have to check the history of each deposit and confiscate coins that have become conspicuous. Either people start using Bisq or use a currency wihtout a history e.G. Monero, zcash, pivx etc.

Bisq is probably the best. But not all countries have a working banking (SEPA) system. The problem with cash is the circulation of counterfeit money.

I dont agree on that. I dont see a world dominating crypto currency. It is not compatible with decentralization. All those Bcash users dream of that ONE currency dominating them all. With that huge block size run by one or two miners.
I am a big fan of the 80/20 rule and i see scaleability by diversity. More small blockchain rather than one giant blockchain. So Bitcoin dominance may become 80% - but it will only be used from 20% of users. Bitcoin could take on the role of lead currency and/or store of value.

Dont be naiv. Bitcoin could not even scale without Altcoins. It would take 50 years for every human on earth to open a lightning channel. Even giant blocksize wont help &lt;- leads to centralization &lt;- leads to high risk (current bcash 30 years). The Blockchain tech just wont allow it. Blockchain needs to scale by diversity + 2nd layer. No dought that Bitcoin is King but Monero has very solid tech and has understood the unix phiolosophy + funguibility and is very specialised on privacy. It has its market niche. Monero could even work with LN. Grin is ok if you are willing to pay the fee on Bitcoin and willing to accept the fakt the receiver needs to be online to receive payments.
P.S. I dont beleive in this world dominating (winner takes it all) crypto currency. In the last decade the industrie has changed to winner takes it all - so people assume it must be the same on crypto currencies. There will never be a currency that is perfect. You always have a tradeoff.
