Send your friends our way! We're having a great time teaching a TON of people about bitcoin. Most have heard about bitcoin (as you can imagine the audience is fairly interested in tech) but haven't taken the initiative to try it out. It's been awesome to be able to give them an intro to bitcoin and then let them try it right away. 
In addition to the $5 giveaway, we also have two long tables with comfortable chairs, 48 outlets, and a variety of chargers, so many, many people have been stopping by to learn about bitcoin while they charge.
If you're around, stop by! Unfortunately, I didn't think to bring swag for existing users, but  shoot me a DM so we can hook you up when we're back home!
 - no keychains, but we do have ping pong balls, temporary tattoos, sticky iwallets, and stickers. Check out the circlebits instagram to see some of it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:43:52
I could say the same about most men I've met.
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:07:39
Thank you! We're looking forward to that as well :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:42:10
That's crazy. 
On a positive note, women were well-represented at the Bitcoin World booth at CES, which I hope indicates our ranks are growing. Both Circle reps were women (I was one), and there were at least three on the BitPay side of the booth too.
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:46:29
Sorry! Our app is only available in 30 countries - we are working to add more. You can see the list [here](

Hi everyone, 
Thanks so much for participating in the SXSW promotion. We were thrilled by your response when we extended the promotion (twice!), but now we've given away more than our budget and have to turn it off.
Giving away bitcoin is the fastest and easiest way to get people using it. We've done it already at MIT, on Wall Street and now at SXSW. Sorry for the premature end, but stay tuned -- this won't be the last time we do this! 
Team Circle 
P.S. To those of you who posted on here and on Twitter before 5:30 ET that you weren't able to collect the bitcoin - we're really sorry. I'll be reaching out to you individually so we can get it to you. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:11:21
Sorry for the delay guys &amp; gals - Just got through sending $5 to people who complained on Twitter. Now will be tackling reddit. Sorry again for the inconvenience, but I can only send $5 to people who complained here before 5pm ET (because I know they were trying for the promo). 
A bit more explanation: We'd only plan to run the promotion at SXSW for those who were in attendance at the panel that featured Jeremy (our CEO), Paul Vigna (WSJ), Mary Dent (dcIQ), and Barry Silbert (SecondMarket, BIT). We ended up putting the promotion on Twitter to make it a little more fun,  still planning to end it as soon as the panel ended. We then decided to extend it for a bit since people on Twitter &amp; Reddit seemed really keen. I then got the okay to extend it even further til 5pm ET. Bear in mind that this promotion - like all giveways - was only valid while supplies (in this case, our budget of bitcoin) lasted.
Unfortunately, we ended up having some server maintenance at the same time as the promotion. Though we'd hoped to keep the promotion on after Circle came back on, it turns out that we were actually on and off til the end of the promotion. (You can see here on reddit that people were collecting money while others weren't able to.)This maxed out our budget.
We're really happy that you guys participated in the giveaway, and we're sorry that you were inconvenienced by the maintenance. To make up for that, I got a little more money to give away, and I'm now going to send $5 to those of you who complained on here and on Twitter while we were down. 
We hope to keep doing promotions like this in the future, ideally without maintenance interrupting. We did the same promotion at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, at the Museum of American Finance on Wall Street, at a beer tasting last night at SXSW (QR printed on cups), at the CPAC, and at a CoinDesk event in London. It's a really great way to get bitcoin into the hands of people who haven't yet tried it, and we'll be doing it again in the future.
Thanks again!
