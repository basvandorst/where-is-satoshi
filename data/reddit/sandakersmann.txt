Sounds like the fee market has taken off lately... :D

Any plans for implementing ether?
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:23:25
Ok :)

Soon your transaction will be unreliable even though you add a decent fee. These days you need a back room deal with miners to transact in an reliable manner.

Big news indeed.

Maybe Peter Todd also can get behind bigger blocks now that 1MB blocks are proven to be an attack vector ;D

Nothing to heal here. Either you believe in the system or you don't.

Sounds familiar...

And still people are wondering why certain altcoins are making new highs day after day...
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:22:05
Back then Bitcoin was not crashing into the artificial 1MB limit. If people start to take the network effect seriously and scale Bitcoin on-chain ASAP, maybe Bitcoin will still be able to hold competitors at bay. If this is not done, Bitcoin will collapse when the network effect is lost.

Nice site :)

Only 4 days left to place your bets and the pool is up to 17.84 BTC.

What does a darknet drug market has to do with national security? The answer is absolutely nothing!
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:37:27
This would certainly help Bitcoin scale on-chain :)

If they need to eliminate trust they must also audit the Bitcoin, Tor, OS and Trezor source code. The hardware wallet and the hardware running the node must also be audited.

Thanks :)

Which exchange do you recommend in Brazil?
@_date: 2016-10-01 21:28:39
[Jaxx]( is great :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:54:51
Thanks. Can you connect your Brazilian bank account to foxbit or walltime?

And how can anyone sign something with the data in the genesis block?

Let me guess, you use Windows?

For Bitcoin to be coercion and censorship resistant you need to pay the miners. No one will pay enormous fees because of competing systems, and when you can't have a high number of transactions because of the 1MB limit the only option left is to implement permanent inflation like Peter Todd is an advocate of.
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:15:37
How can Bitcoin succeed at 1MB?
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:55:10
Yes. I feel safe now. /s
