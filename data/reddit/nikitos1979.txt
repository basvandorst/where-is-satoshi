Bitcoin price stopped caring about China about a month ago.

My question is what happens when the blockchain keeps growing in size.  The amount of storage space required is growing exponentially.   At some point it will require some serious storage/processing power to maintain.

There will still be bitcoins to be made by miners due to transaction fees.

Love the alarmist title.  But then looking at OP's post history it makes total sense.
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:21:37
Linear growth is still exponential technically speaking.  Exponent is just 1.

I'm going to look into arbitrage, the price differences are nearly 10%, this should be pretty easy to exploit

If you're in the Horsham area, I'm a big fan of Freedom Credit Union.  No letters for coinbase transactions :)

So you held on to 2000 BTC and NOW are worried about it going to zero?  Right.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:57:44
Say you're not currently planning to buy more BTC.  You see a $120 spread between coinbase and mtgox.  You sell 5 of your coins on mtgox and instantly buy on coinbase.   In the end you have the same number of btc but just made a nice profit even with the transaction fees.  The downside is that now your new BTC wont be available on coinbase for a few days and you'll need some time to cash out your dollars from mtgox.  But this seems like a very reasonable arbitrage, where am I off on this?

Been there, done that

I bought at coinbase last week at $700, was finally approved to buy more today.

Don't expect to make any money mining at this point.  If you want to dabble in mining, buy a couple of GPUs and start mining some alt-currencies.

Man that was some expensive weed I was buying on silkroad when BTC was $10 a pop.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:11:08
Not gonna lie, silkroad

New type of troll.

If you just want to see how it works, use whatever computer you already have to try it out.  Find an alt-currency that uses scrypt and give it a try.  Join a pool and let it run overnight, the next day you should have a fraction of whatever currency you decided to mine.  If you want to get serious then buy some graphics cards and setup a rig.  If you decide mining isnt for you at least you'll easily be able to resell them.  Buying a USB bitcoin ASIC is a waste of money.

Wow.  That is awesome, can you say pop culture penetration?

I admit I panic sold at 700 on Friday, but was able to rebuy double at 680.  Lesson  learned and it worked out ok this time.
