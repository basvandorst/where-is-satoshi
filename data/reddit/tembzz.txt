Weirdest thing ever, tried it on another computer and the balance came up. It's like it was glitched and wasn't updating properly on my other pc

Correct address, and I sent it to segwit wallet, and checked legacy inc case. Still no show of the transaction. What info can I give u to help you to see if there is a problem?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:38:29

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:21
yes, its all there, just not on my ledger. Why is it there but not on my ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:40:20
So I was talking to my parents about Bitcoin and my dad brought up the fact that our family in switzerland could buy bitcoin and get more out of it because us dollars is less than swiss francs. is that a good idea? when i visit my family my aunt could buy bitcoin and i could then transfer it on my ledger... right? or is there no point to that?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:14:25
ah! thanks for the explanation, makes sense now! noob at this :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:45
custom build 2k pc ;-; its also 25 pounds ;-;
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:19:03
happened to me and my ledger. had to reinstall chome app:
Make sure to check that address matches exactly/ restart app
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:04:48
making hardware wallets illegal is like making a normal wallet illegal to hold a 20$ bill. thats so dumb
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:59:25
thanks! will do that, no tampering from your 3rd party seller?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:40:08
should i request a refund and buy a ledger off amazon with solid reviews?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:48
was recieved 3 hours ago. I sent a 500$ worth of btc and when it hit confirm stage it showed up on my ledger as unconfirmed. But this time nothing, no transaction history of it being unconfirmed.
edit: also on blockcypher it says it was confirmed and delivered but it is not in my ledger ;-;
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:03:17
sending from coinbase to my ledger is zero fees but sending from ledger to coinbase has a fee. I’m also a freshley turned 18 y/o and gdax cant verify me from public record, im two weeks into waiting for support to fix the issue, so im stuck with coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:50:59
so just stick to usd? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:03:54
*pun intesifies*
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:54:23
so i have 800$ on coinbase, best for me to send it fo my ledger? i tested it with 20$ and the fee to send it back to coinbase was ridiculous, half my money gone. any way to lessen fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:06
reconnected it to the other pc, and it doesnt show up there.. Why is that? issue with desktop pc?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:46
just did, and a reboot. Still same thing. Weirdest thing ever. Could it be something with backup stored on my computer?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:37
FIXED!!! uninstalled and reinstalled the app, now shows updated transactions. &lt;3 thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:11:17
i got some btc already but if the exchange could allow me to buy more for my money (I have a swiss savings bank) then maybe it could be worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:03:39
i like to spread my funds around 80% btc 20% ltc
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:34

waiting for manual activation because my bank isnt on the list (town bank) to confirm it. either it holds in the wallet and im fine or not
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:44
yes, but to have a USD wallet i need to confirm identity. and id just like to have a completed account.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:57:12
if u try to confirm identity and its incorrect coinbase puts a cooldown on when u can try agaib
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:54:44

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:56:26
i had to call my bank and allow all transactions for coinbase otherwise they would be blocked. transactions came from britain while i live in usa. try that
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:58
worsr part is im locked from trying again for a total of 21 hours...
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:41

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:06:13
was an issue before i attempted to link my bank :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:38:29
 coinbase doesnt show up on background app refresh for me
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:46:19
was able to link it manually. fixed!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:55
i think its just high traffic not ddosing
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:56:26
I cannot deposit or withdraw because my identity isnt confirmed. im putting in all the right info but says its wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:04:33
how can one get access to private keys?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:16
which banks accept cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:11:26
super weird. my wallet works. i think this is a glitch lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:00:51
maybe its a bug because im testing to see if my wallet works or not (sold 5$ of btc)  and it is still on pending. im new to this so i believe it just takes a while but the only reason im doing this as well is to make if i ever sell that i can actually send the money to my bank account
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:02:27
ah i get it! thanks :)
What amount would be good to then store in a wallet? And are there any fees for transferring btc to a wallet because the word fee is everywhere with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:01:28
my question is what is the backside of my passport, the back of the passport or page with information on it?
