It costs nothing to create a SegWit address. Create one and start using it. When the mempool looks empty (usually weekends) send your other Bitcoin there, send it as low priority if you want to save even more. It's not as bad as you're  making it out to be. Come on. You can send a high priority transaction for 140sat/byte right now.

2. This doesn't "derail" the network. You can't steal funds with a 51% attack, it allows double spending, so the double spends ypu want to sign have to be more profitable than the 51% attack costs you.
3. Your mining equipment has now devalued

There was no way to measure this majority you speak of. It was perceived. There was no user activation or vote or any consensus mechanism to measure it and that is why I say Vitalik did it. Regardless, the immutability of ethereum was gone at that moment. Transactions were reversed,  you can argue semantics all day amd say no first they went to recovery contract or whatever but the end result is transactions were reversed.

And how easy is it to teach people about a new protocol implementation, what a hard fork is and why there are 2 bitcoin chains now and how not to send money to the wrong chain or interact with it in a way where they could lose all their money ? If it isn't "working" that is the fault of the community, the exchanges, the merchants, not the people who are pouring their time and money into development
SegWit wasn't just about the blocksize increase. It also fixed transaction malleability, fixed the quadratic hashing bug and will allow for many more future optimizations like schnorr signatures and MAST and allow layer 2 and up to operate safer and more efficient without segmenting the network.  SegWit is long term thinking, the kind of thinking that has kept bitcoin so secure and made it anti-fragile.

Most if not all alt coins have centralized governance and a small dev team. This game is really about censorship resistance, security and anti-fragility, things that Bitcoin has built over these 9 years. Everything else will be built on top of this digital gold. Alt coiners seem to think the game is transactions per second or some other technical measurement.
Bitcoin is about changing the world, saving lives by giving people back sound money, and separating state from money. Alt coins can have their use case taken away instantly with something like lightning network or sidechains or even another alt coin.

This is another reason why the imposter coin is dead in the water. It is near impossible to have sub satoshi fees on chain. It would require a massive overhaul of the network involving some full on mathematics and computer science. Without layer 2 if the price goes up say 10,000x so does the minimum fee.

 A Blockchains entire use case is censorship resistance.
For a blockchain to be censorship resistant it needs be be secure and decentralized.
To be decentralized and secure it needs to be proof of work.

To have miners you need a block reward and a fee market.
To have a healthy block reward and fee market you need all the properties of Bitcoin.

By doing that you start reducing all of the benefits DPOS has over traditional POS and you start introducing all of the issues traditional POS has. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


No offence but I'm not sure if you know how blockchains work, there are forks happening all the time. In Bitcoin the longest chain is superseding shorter chains regularly and there are even orphaned blocks. In Nano, delegated nodes are deciding what history is correct/incorrect and writing blocks over it.

Where does it say in the whitepaper that you can fuck with the difficulty adjustment algo because you can't get enough hashpower to create a contentious fork ?

@_date: 2018-05-02 15:16:54
It's so much easier to manipulate voting dynamics than it is to gather up majority hash rate. Hash power requires a real world scarce resource and even if you do manage to gather it up your not incentivised to be a bad actor with that hashing capability. DPOS votes don't really cost much, especially if the speculative token was to crash in value. There is no incentive for voting nodes to agree with the correct fork and for minority nodes to agree with the majority fork. Lets also not forget that Bitgrail was hacked and a large portion of the Nano supply is in the hands of bad actors.
Nanos implementation lacks byzantine fault tolerance. Satoshi created proof of work to solve the byzantine generals problem. You can't just throw it out and then say "these centralized entities are now going to decide what the correct  fork is" because the speed at which information travels is not instantaneous. If there was ever a cascade of inter-chained reorgs when more than one double spends are reverted by a fork, the correct network state would be uncertain. 
Complex game theory can start arising too, opposed to a POW where it's naturally self correcting and going against the majority, even if its just for idealistic reasons will cost you dearly. 
POS can only go two directions. One direction is centralization which is the route nano has chosen. The other is performing the same if not more work than POW. There are some hybrid systems proposed that might work  but we need to see POC on a large scale. But even then POS has huge economical downsides. Rent seeking behaviour encouragement etc.

We only have one attack vector. Miners that are mining a coin that shouldn't exixt and probably wont have any relevance within 5 years. They are also in a glass house. ASIC resitance alt coin can be attacked by anyone mining any GPU mineable altcoin and that is willing to coorditate with others for a certain amount of time.
Another big difference. ASIC miners have invested into their hardware for one purpose. If they suceed in destroying bitcoin they have essentially turned their custom hardware into bricks and their surplus cheap elextricity into a useless resource doing nothing just to double spend on a now worthless network. The attackers who attacked bgold can now go and mine whatever they were mining before.

Actually BIP 50 by definition wasn't a hard fork, there was a temp unintentional chain split and the bug fix was a soft fork. The other two were imposing more restrictions on the protocol but the thing is not one transaction took advantage of those loose restrictions before fork, so fully compatible. One could make a strong case for the argument that Bitcoin has never hard forked.

Thats all fine up untill the point you started talking about using private nodes which is a pointless endevour. As soon as the attacker broadcasts the state to the actual network we will know about the reorg. There is reorg detection built in. When I say it will destroy bitcoin what I mean is that the reputation of that network will vanish  because there are double spent coins on it and the obvious solution is that we would hard fork and use another algorithm. We would have to use the nuclear option.
At this point one entity will never be able to conjure up that amount of hardware and electricity. Not even a nation state.

Gaving wasn't writing any code, he wasn't even in discussion on IRC or on Github. He was parading himself around as the leader of bitcoin and at that time the CIA was snooping around. He was just a security liability. His commit access was revoked not his ability to help the community. If he wants to contribute there is nothing stopping him. Many developers are anonymous. 
Good code needs to be backed up with good ideas. Vitaliks ideas were simply not the direction the bitcoin community wanted to go in. His ideas got peer reviewed and rejected because the Bitcoin community wanted to head in a different direction focused on hypersecurity. Luckily. Also I know many people would push back on the statement that Vitalik is a good programmer. I can't say because I only know a bit of Java but we are talking about a guy who still hasn't been able to do a simple multisig and facilitated the DAO hack.


You can't measure adoption. Outputs are not a an accurate measurement for anything, and you can no longer count transactions as lightning network is live on mainnet but if we want to start counting you should know that dogecoin has more transactions than bcash.

They have as much say as anyone else who can write good code. The people who contribute code and ideas to the Bitcoin Core client do not have special privileges. Even if their code gets in it's been through the BIP workflow which means it's been thoroughly vetted and peer reviewed by the community. The direction of Bitcoin is decided by merchants, miners, developers, exchanges, full node operators, etc. It's not decided by whatever you quantify as Bitcoin core.

It was a different network from the very first block as they changed the difficulty adjustment algorithm. It was never any resemblence to any form of bitcoin that existed earlier just with bigger blocks. They knew they would never get enough miners to mine that garbage so they decided to fuck with the inflation rate. Satoshi's vision.
0.7 is compatible with the BTC chain. The only reason earlier versions aren't is because of the emergency soft fork (BIP 50) deployment. Not because of a consensus split. There is essentially a critical vulnerability in earlier versions.

Vitalik is a scammer because he put an unregistered security on the market and set the stage for the all of these shitcoin scams. He also kept millions of premine ether for himself and then bailed himself out of the DAO not too long after. 
Eric was one of the major proponents for calling SegWit2x Bitcoin and giving it the BTC ticker. BTW, this is the fork that was so slap dashed that it's still stuck on block 400,000 or something.

When you don't batch, almost every transaction creates two outputs, one for the payment one for change. Space is wasted for the additional output and for the signature to spend it in a subsequent transaction.
When you batch, each transaction creates many outputs, at most one of which is change. So asymptotically batching halves the number of outputs created for a given load.
Batching can also reduce outputs by combining multiple withdraws into one. E.g. Alice withdraws 1 BTC to her wallet then 5 minutes later withdraws 2 BTC more. If the batch hadn't issued yet this just gets converted into a single 3 BTC output.


The Bitcoin ABC Github is a ghost town and all communications are done privately. It's totally centralized. You guys issue public statements for christs sake. Bitcoin development and discussion on the other hand is fully transparent and follow the same BIP workflow that Satoshi followed.

"It's the same situation as gold and gold mining.  The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold.  Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange.
I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.  The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used.  Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste."

A blockchain is for censorship resistance.

For a blockchain to be censorship resistant it needs be be secure and decentralized. 

To be decentralized and secure it needs to be proof of work. 

To be proof of work it needs miners. 

To have miners you need a block reward and a fee market. 

To have a healthy block reward and fee market you need all of the properties of Bitcon.

These guys like to think they follow the whitepaper word for word like it's the bible and Satoshi is Jesus but where in it does it say you can forcefully change the difficulty adjustment to create a hard fork with the same algorithm that doesn't have consensus ? You shouldn't be able to do that because then anyone with a couple s9's can then hard for your coin without waiting 100 years for the difficulty adjustment.

You also have the issue of how these different implementations are going to communicate with each other. The only way it can and should be done is the way it is being done with lightning where you have an agreed upon design spec (not sure if it can be done with Bitcoin) . The way altcoins are doing it where they just get in a meeting room or on a conference call is a terrible idea for multiple reasons.

Having older versions of the client on the network adds resiliency. The network obviously doesn't instantly uograde unless it is a hard fork.

Yeah I remember that, there was like a block per minute. They hyperinflated the shit out of it. They did it on purpose because without it no one would of mined the garbage, plus it was a coordinated attack to steal hashrate away from Bitcoin so their spam attack would be more effective. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:19:31

No. Bitcoin acceptance is obviously not widespread. Until hyperbitcoinization happens this is the best alrernative to crypto credit cards which accept a bunch shitcoins which shouldn't be supported in my opinion. I can't speak for Jimmy Song but I watch every podcast and I'd say this is where he is coming from.

Tablet would be better for privacy as you would install a deterministic  wallet which would generate a new receiving address after each transaction. A code on the wall would probably be acceptable for tips. Just scan and check it once in a while to make sure someone hasn't switched it for their own.

Crypto cards like the coinbase one or the tenx one are pointless because backend they are just selling your bitcoin for fiat and they support shitcoins like bcash and ethereum.

The purpose is to increase anti-fragility and censorship resistance. ISPs are a the weakest link in the internet chain. Governments can execute censorship at the ISP level. Think of this as a way to bypass your ISP to hop on to another one or a satellite. Some countries only have one or two ISPs. If a government blocks Bitcoin at the protocol level, putting up a satellite might put a target on your back.

Yes but you're limited to using eclair since you're on win 10 (unless you run a virtual machine) so you will have to update your eclair config on every WAN IP change. There is no support in eclair for specifying a domain name yet as far as I'm aware. I tried to two versions ago and it didn't work.

Just do me one favor. Next time you see Vitalik or someone else in Ethereum advocating one of these things just ask yourself "do I really need censorship resistance for (said thing)",  "do I really need a token for (said thing)." Then ask yourself, is it really decentralized when the distributor and maintainer of (said thing) can just stop the contract, change parameters, or just literally do anything to the contract. The cryptokitties maintainer can just take ownership of all the kitties and no one can do anything about it.

@_date: 2018-06-25 09:26:08


Actually you have it entirely wrong. I don't need to be voted in to validate transactions/blocks with my node. In a DPOS system like Nano for example unless you are voted in as a representative all you can do is vote on your preffered representative, that's it. You can't even validate your own transactions, you can only send your block(transaction) to be validated by a representative as they are the ones who are tasked with trying to to establish some kind of fault tolerance and make sure there are no bad forks with double spends. As a representative you construct blocks and validate, you do everything. In Bitcoin anyone can validate and anyone can construct blocks, there is no barrier to entry, there are no voting dynamics, there is no game theory, there are no "official representatives".


If Jihan gave you the keys to his farms and said "here it's yours forever do what you want, take it for free" Would try to do an elaborate 51&amp; attack which would have to be at least 6 blocks deep to achieve anything of note and will be detected very fast as Bitcoin has reorg detection built in or would you just mine Bitcoin with it ? For the sake of this lets assume he actually has 51&amp; hashrate.

For us to begin to compare first we have to determine how many full archiving nodes are live and synced on the Ethereum protocol and such information is not available anywhere, the only information available is total nodes which could be a combination of any type of node.

Personally, no. I think we are still overbought but history has shown that hashrate is a lagging indicator anyway. During the bear market of 2014 the hashrate was increasing. It's matched but lagging, people mined Bitcoin when it was worth $0 and had zero utility. Chips don't get created instantly out of thin air, electricity contracts aren't negotiated and scouted instantly etc etc. Takes time.

Next time one of these ICOs get your interest just ask yourself "do I really need censorship resistance for (said thing)", "do I really need a speculative token for said thing." Then ask yourself, is it really decentralised (censorship resistance) when the distributor and maintainer of said thing can just stop the contract, change parameters or in the cryptokitties game just take ownership of all the cats and no one can do anything about it.

The idea is that Bitcoin someday will be the world reserve currency. So instead of valuing it against the USD. The USD will be valued against Bitcoin. The way this is achieved is simply by Bitcoin having more liquidity than the USD.

I disagree. One huge thing that makes Bitcoin so different to shitcoins and so appealing to me is that in general our people are not shy to call out devs and we aren't scared of fighting things out till the very end. This is healthy. We aren't Ethereum where we just do lord Vitalik's bidding and we aren't Bcash where a political figure can direct huge consensus changes and no one even bats an eylid and a quarter of the network doesn't even know about it. Lets remember that the vast majority of regular Bitcoin core contributors were against the UASF. It was proposed by an anonynous contributor and activated by us.

There is a reason no large scale coins have gone proof of stake. It's flawed on so many levels. Technically, economically and logically. No one is going to adopt a system which is designed to make the rich richer and encourages rent seeking behaviour, and in ethereums case it is especially bad because Vitalik premined 12 Million ether for himself. It is inevitable that it eventually degrades into either centralisation or performing the same if not more work. It's a cat chasing it's tail, if you want to perform less work then you have to centralise if you don't want centralisation then you have huge security risks and everyone stake grinding. Ethereum has a difficulty bomb coded into it which causes the POW difficulty to go up to a point where you cant use POW anymore, it was advertised as a feature along with "code is law" , it was supposed to force Vitalik to move to POS three years ago and he keeps defusing it.

If the SEC calls ETH a security that's probably the end of the shitcoin sea. All exchanges across the world will have to stop trading it within 90 days. Sure you can trade it on their knock off of localbitcoins or on decentralized exchanges but that massive drop in liquidity basically kills it.
If that doesn't happen it will fail on it's on merits eventually. Vitalik is now trying to sell merged mined sidechains/child blocks as "sharding" which is something he apparently created. They are on the desperation path. Their solutions always involve more complexity, more attack surface. When a large portion of your nodes drop off the network because of cryptokitties game it's the beginning of the end.

There are other cryptos. There were also private internets in the early days of the internet, they didn't work out so well, it turns out network effect is a big deal. 
Bitcoin is not rare, it has a limited/predictable supply which will be essential traits for the next world reserve currency. Bitcoin is unique, the only reason there are clones is because it's open source and people can literally click on a fork button on Github to copy it. When Satoshi made it public it was a unique.
Bitcoin is not unreplaceable, the UTXO set is though, so basically if we have to overhaul the entire thing we can but the account of who owns how many Bitcoin will just be bolted back on to the new system. Bitcoin is sound, unconfiscatable, borderless, trustless money.

In addition to what other users have said. Atomic multi path payments will be implemented.

This is why economic activity by itself doesn’t tell you anything. People could be trading the same 2 Bolivar note back and forth 500 million times and that would count in the economic activity statistics as a billion dollars of transactions. There are people in Venezuela who have Bitcoin, but what do you think they are spending, the good money or the crap money ? Smart person holds and hoards the good money and spends the shitcoins.


What does that even mean ? It's not a competition, no one is keeping score. Assess  the fundamentals and reason up from there.


Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment vehicle. It was released in 2009 after the global financial crisis not by accident, Satoshi's intention was for it to become the world reserve currency. It is not something that was intended as an investment but sound money has to be market driven, it can't be stablecoin because then it has to be pegged to something else and it can't have a value of zero because then there would be no incentive for miners to secure it, there is one option left - market driven.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that everything will be eventually pegged to it. Just as it is the world reserve cryptocurrency, the vision is that some day it will also be the world reserve currency. It will replace the gold standard we once had. Governments will hold Bitcoin reserves and if they want to fractional reserve it that's up to them. Bitcoin doesn't need a billion transactions a second to be sound money. Believing that you need this is what governments want you to believe, this is the Keynesian economist mindset.

There is always the threat of nation state attacks and hashrate increases voluntarily in parallel to overall utility. It's perfectly designed system with razor thin margin lines.
*"It’s the same situation as gold and gold mining. The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.”*

Bcash have eliminated all the objectivity in Bitcoin, it is completely arbitrary. It isn't based on Nakamoto consensus. It is a  social problem rather than a mathematical problem which is exactly what Bitcoin is trying to get away from to make it socially scalable.

@_date: 2018-06-06 09:42:58
Most if not all of altcoins have centralized governance and a small dev team. Altcoiners seem to think the game is  about transactions per second or some other technical measurement that at the specific time Bitcoin is perceived to be struggling with, most altcoiners don't even understand what a security trade off is and this is very apparent when I hear altcoiners talking about how 10 minute blocks are too long and how we need 10 second blocks. Bitcoin is about censorship resistance, hypersecurity and anti\-fragility, traits that Bitcoin has built over these 9 years. Everything else will be built on top of this digital gold. Bitcoin is about giving people back sound money, and separating state from money.
If an alt coin has some kind of "better tech" then there is no reason that this specific tech can't be implemented into Bitcoin or a sidechain or run on lightning or run on top of lightning or layer 4/5/6/7 etc etc, but there really isn't anything that an altcoin dev team has done that is remotely interesting. Think about this, there has never been a single altcoin proposal or technology that has EVER made it into Bitcoin, not one, and according to Adam Back who recently spoke on a podcast at consensus there is still nothing interesting but literally just about every altcoin has something from Bitcoin in it, multisig and BIP 0032 are good examples but Satoshi created proof of work and there is no blockchain tech better than that. Bitcoin is the most actively developed cryptocurrency and if an altcoin does one or two or even ten things better that's still not enough. For it to be considered so much better that we all have to move to it, it has to do just about everything better because you don't throw away the biggest network effect and developer ecosystem because (insert shitcoin here) does more transaction per second. If this miracle does happen, great, we just take the Bitcoin UTXO set and port it. We don't try to create new global wealth distribution or some kind of ponzi or coin printing scheme.

Because there is 21 million Bitcoin not 63. I would have no problem with your proposal if you instead proposed to make those implementations sidechains because it doesn't break the economics and the most important part of Bitcoin. The problem is that the the bad actors who go and create shitcoins and then claim them to be Bitcoin usually have big egos so they wont settle for a compromise.

If price goes up 20x so does price of fees in USD. As long as the fees stay reasonable in terms of satoshi's, were good.

1. $70 will be better off on chain. Lightning is a solution for micropayments

Bcash has now been opened up to a subjective evaluation of who is honest and who is dishonest, they have eliminated the objectivity, it is now completely arbitrary. They have turned Bcash into a social problem rather than a mathematical problem which is exactly what Bitcoin tries to get away from and it does that to make it socially scalable. One party and another do not have to have the same perspective or the same subjective idea of who the good guy or the bad guy is. Verify don’t trust. This isn't the fist time though, Bcash was always trusted and permissioned. They have pushed private updates out to trusted miners in the past [
Defending this double spend attack is exactly against everything in the whitepaper and the value of cash, cash is called cash because of transaction finality. It is a key characteristic of cash and we don’t need permission or trust in a third party telling us whether or not we can make a cash transaction, that is what makes it useful and powerful. You can’t defend this and also say you are trying to make electronic cash for the world. Replacing transactions you deem dishonest with honest transactions has no place in Bitcoin or electronic cash for the world.
Bcash continues to market 0-conf as safe as well and now we have definitive proof that it so far from safe that it shouldn't even be a conversation.
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:11:27
Because Bitcoiners would rather just mine some Bitcoin. 2 Bcash miners did 51% attack Bcash  though on the 15th of May.

TLDR: You accuse Bitcoin of being a religion.
What about Austrian economists are they a religion too ? What about Anarchists ?  Bitcoin "maximalism" is really just moderate common sense, it isn't complicated. The other two economic theories that are most commonly subscribed to are way more extremist. One stems from fear, lack of knowledge, or lack of awareness and the other greed, there isn't a lot of rationale in either one. If you honestly believe central banking is sustainable or that having a shitcoin for every usecase, facebook coin, amazon coin, starbucks coin is a good idea or even possible, you are the extremist. If you instead claim "no I believe in this altcoin only" then how are you better than me ?

Random nocoiner: "But Ecoin is a better store of value than Bitcoin because it is stable" 
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:37:39
The difference is though that the cost of doing something like that is 20x + on BTC and I would predict that the Bitcoin community would uprise in some kind of way against miners who performed it if they managed to do it  somehow kind of like the the way we did with the UASF. Hitting the nuclear button could even be considered (changing the mining algo) as a last resort, it is always there. Bitcoin has built an immune system over 10 years. Just look at what happened at the mere mention of Binance rolling back the chain to undo the heist. No one would stand for it. Without transaction finality there is not much of a point to Bitcoin.
On the other hand Bcash has no problem rolling back their chain, they have eliminated objectivity, it is now completely arbitrary. They have turned Bcash into a social system rather than a mathematical one, and they will soon find out that social systems don't scale. Wait till an actual proper Bcash hack/heist/whatever happens and the discussion about whether they should roll back the chain comes up. CSW vs Roger Ver was nothing.

No. The amount of full validating Ethereum nodes is obfuscated. The prediction is that there are way less than 1000, exchanges can afford to run them but thats about it, and the Ethereum blockchain size is about 1.5TB.

Roger Ver was scared that Craig Wright was secretly mining blocks and the he had a longer chain with more proof of work that he was going to release at any moment. If Craig had one and released it, it would of written over Roger Ver's chain (reorging). The problem is, POW was designed this way, there is no other way to decide which fork is correct other than your node looking at the longest chain with the most proof of work and deciding that one is the valid chain, this is in the whitepaper. What Roger Ver has done is gone back on his constant talking points about miners and has decided to put in this checkpoint that tells ABC nodes which block is correct, so even if there is a longer chain with more proof of work it would be considered invalid.

I believe it can eliminate most fiat. I say most because countries like  Iran and Venezuela exist. These kinds of dictatorships will either just create their own "fiat like" centralized tokens, continue inflating their supply or create a new fiat money. Dictatorships don't even consider the internet helpful, these are countries that have actively criminalized Bitcoin.
That being said, for it to take the global reserve currency status it will take sone kind of global disaster. A war, financial crisis or  something like that.

This is good. Craig Wright and the Bcash brigade are the biggest muppets in crypto. Cash doesn't have a limited supply, Bitcoin was the first solution that allowed for digital payments without having to rely on a trusted third-party intermediary, which is what the function of cash is - not having to rely on a third party trusted intermediary. Satoshi didn't subtitle the whitepaper "P2P electronic cash" because he envisioned how much the world needs censorship resistant coffee buying backed by 50 exahash of security.

Exactly, with this dumb logic you can also call it bitcoin knots. They are trying to confuse people into thinking Bcash is on par with Bitcoin somehw. I watched a lightning FUD video by some Swedish dude and he kept going on about how Bitcoin core (BTC) is a fork of bitcoin. What they don't realise is they are only hurting themselves, newbies look at this shit and throw their hands up in the air and then go buy something else.

Also another reason it can cause a crash is because of a trading strategy called a "stop loss", it works like this. If you buy Bitcoin at say 9000 you can set your stop loss at say 8700 which will cause an automatic sell of your bitcoin at that lower price to either minimise your losses or so you can buy back in cheaper as it continues to fall, so as the price was going down everyone stop losses could of been getting triggered driving the price lower and lower.

A Blockchains entire use case is for censorship resistance.
For a blockchain to be censorship resistant it needs be be secure and decentralized.

As Charlie lee said, Bitcoin payments are not peer to peer. Payments are sent from sender to miners, who record it on a distributed ledger. The sender doesn't have to have any communication with the recipient in any P2P manner at all and can even be offline. Cash doesn't have a limited supply either. He referred it as a cash system because he wanted to highlight the fact that there is no third party trusted intermediary like the cryptos before had. The dogmatic holy whitepaper cult and Satoshi worshipers are fucking ridiculous, they laser focus on "peer to peer" then at the same time say shit like "nodes are only for miners, they don't do anything." You are not even a participant in the initial p2p flood network unless you run a node!! Then he does shit like CTOR, secret checkpoints, rolling checkpoints, DSV, fucking with the difficulty algo after claiming Bcash is the whitepaper purist coin and then he opposes Craig's blocksize increase after years of fighting for blocksize increases and saying they are the only way to scale.

Not worth splitting the network and possibly creating another contentious fork and also creating all the risk that comes with a hard fork for a band aid. If we hard fork it has to include the entire wishlist not just a blocksize increase. When we fork for confidential transactions and a bunch of other stuff we can add a small blocksize increase.

Bitcoin isn't really peer to peer. Payments are sent from sender to miners, who record it on a distributed ledger. The initial broadcast is P2P but payments aren't P2P. The sender doesn't have to have any communication with the recipient in any P2P manner at all and can even be offline. Lightning transactions are actually much closer to behaving like peer to peer transactions.
The reference in the whitepaper was most likely to highlight the fact that Bitcoin does not require a third party trusted intermediary as the cryptocurrencies before it did, that it was different to them. Laser focusing on the P2P cash reference is counter productive and is leaning towards dogmatism, halting critical thinking and progress. Why don't you laser focus on the longest chain reference and see how far it gets you with your SPV clients ?
"*What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact with each other without the need for a trusted third party"*

Their isn't much bitcoin in circulation. Only about 5-10% of the 17 Million bitcoin that has been mined is actually being actively traded, most is in cold storage. When you go and dump nearly 1% of that volume all at once your going to start a chain reaction of panic sell offs.

Most people are not against 2MB blocks down the line if its absolutely necessary. They are not necessary right now, the mempool is empty, there are no spam attacks and SegWit adoption is still under 10%. The nature of hard forks cause a heavy impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem and to hard fork when its not necessary is a huge waste of resources and a security liability for no reason. A hard fork should only be implemented to fix an emergency bug or if it has overwhelming consensus like you see right now with the Ethereum fork and like you have seen in the past with the countless Monero forks.

That doesn't mean it is a bad store of value. That actually means it is a bad unit of account, at this moment in time. If Bitcoin was a better unit of account you would be thinking $1USD=15800 Satoshi instead of 1BTC=$6000. That can be fixed and is the ultimate goal. There is also some anchoring bias and short term thinking. Ask any veteran investor about what a long term investement is and there is no way in hell they are going to say 6 months or 1 year.
To assess whether something is a good store of value you need to look at the fundamentals and reason up from there. It is decentralized, easily divisible, has a predictable supply, immutable, unconfiscatable. All great properties for a store of value.

Even if ECDSA is cracked, the people who haven't exposed their public key are still safe. The people who have can move to a new easily identifiable quantum resistant address/algorithm and this can be a soft fork now that we have SegWit in.
Here is the problem, in the early days of Bitcoin, people used pay-to-public-key (P2PK) instead of pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) so Satoshi's public keys are totally exposed. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

This is exactly what the Bcash scammers are waiting and hoping for, in addition to a POW change. I think a better solution is to try and educate more developers, kind of like what Jimmy Song is doing and get some more implementations really going. Not the way Bcash is doing it where they have 1 developer per implementation which happened by accident because all the scams decided to collaborate against Bitcoin. This will lessen the damage of a malicious Bitcoin Core client being released and give us a buffer if it did happen.

Bitcoin is motivating advancements in IC efficiency so the 1:1 map is not perfect. It's entirely possible that we may be able to triple the hashrate at the current energy consumption levels without the price increasing at all. Samsung is currently developing a 7nm ASIC chip.

I could be wrong think most of the Segwit coding was done by Lawrence Nahum and Pieter Wuille from blockstream. It was then on testnet in Jan 2016. The asicboost miners then refused to activate it through a MASF for a long time. After hearing wind of the UASF proposals that's when the whole SegWit2X thing started from Jeff Garzic and friends. The NYA meeting actively excluded core and blockstream.
The only thing that activated SegWit was the UASF. The NYA had nothing to do with it.

Craig Wright's proposed solution was to make miners (somehow) orphan blocks with double spends in them which is absolutely insane because you dramatically reduce the hashrate of the network by doing that.

Segwit was coded mainly by Lawrence Nahum of blockstream. It's a bitcoin core project. The reason it was activated on litecoin first was because of the MASF issues. The miners kept blocking activation and there was a narrative going around that funds could be stolen from SegWit addresses. So regardless of flawless testnet operation it was still being blocked by some big miners. Charlie lee approached the bitcoin core devs and suggested getting it activated on litecoin which happened. Then he set up SegWit address with the equivalent of $1 Million USD worth of litecoin in it for anyone to hack the funds out of. In the end, no one claimed the bounty and all this didn't work and the UASF had to be activated to get SegWit on main net. The testing was already done. Litecoin just has the privilege of having centralized governance.

You have got to be kidding me with this. I keep hearing about this superior alt coin tech. Can't wait to actually see it. When you look at alt coins all you see is either ridiculous ideas that were laughed out of the room, old BIPs, copy paste jobs or code that is based on research performed by blockstream but because altcoins are centralized and don't give a shit about testing they slap dash it in first. Monero has the right idea but that's about it. You will find traces of bitcoin development in just about every single alt coin even the very small amount of non bitcoin codebased ones but please tell me, when was the last time bitcoin devs borrowed code from an alt coin ?

and a lot of the hashrate moved to the imposter coin because miners realized their new difficulty algo was broken (most likely on purpose) and was rewarding them with a block per minute. They were printing it like the FED. If the imposter coin can just change the difficulty algo as they see fit it isn't even hard money.

Using an altcoin for Bitcoin security seems redundant.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:00:17
That was not a bail out, it didn't betray anyones trust or reverse any transactions. There was no rollback. The bug was identified and a there was a soft fork deployment, it was fixed in 3-5 hours without any contention, the coins were not even spent and it is not even possible to roll back with a soft fork anyway, soft forks add new rules to the existing rules. The new rule added in this case was to reject value overflow transactions.

@_date: 2019-05-10 14:17:52
Again with this....... No transactions were reversed and no blocks were rolled back in the overflow bug incident. One output was bugged and a (uncontentious) soft fork deployment (newly introduced rules) made the output invalid via a rule that stated that any output over 21 Million Bitcoin is invalid. That's it, there was no rolling back, the overflow wasn't even spent to any addresses. It was a totally different situation and resolution.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:41:51
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:05:30
Incorrect. That's not how this worked and think about the consequences of that for a second. All other transactions were included as they were valid, the only consequence to those transactions was that starting from the first new good block the confirmation count was 0 for all transactions within those 61 blocks.

It now requires 20 confirmations on most exchanges, the only reason it isn't more is Proof Of Node checkpoints. That sounds like a coin on the brink of dying, but it wont though because Roger Ver will keep his node and his miners running till it's worth 0.001 and he will keep mining till all his money is burnt and he has to resort to using a stone hammer against a rock under a bridge. No you wont be able to 51% attack it because proof or Roger Ver. He wont change algo either because then it isn't bitcoin, he will be beating his hammer and with every hit he will be declaring his Bitcoin as the real Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-23 15:04:44
If you believe in altcoins you believe in inflation. 21 million Bitcoin means nothing to you. You also have no choice but to come from a positon where you believe this is a free market where anyone is free to print money and that thousands upon thousands of monetary systems can coexist in a society. This devolves into communism where nothing actually has value besides hard labor and in turn, fiat. Back to square one. It has nothing to do with what Monero is doing.

Not so easy, Roger Ver is an "investor," however I think we should refrain from attacks and especially personal attacks unless we have verifiable proof that they have not implemented SegWit because the Ver paid them off. 
If it is has nothing to do with Ver and it is a matter of lazyness or technical competence then perhaps we could pool some Bitcoin for a bounty if they would allow us (yes we shouldn't have to).

Yes, which is why I don't see CTs ever happening on mainnet. Not worth the risk of splitting the network and we can just have a bigger block or faster block private sidechain, we have one now; L-BTC which is federated which is fine for certain usecases but we can do a non-federated side chain with a soft fork. 
I know the Bcashers will downvote and hate on any sidechain talk but while they do this they are also putting in DSV for token issuing on Bcash and praising Ethereums sharding which is really just merge mined sidechains.
