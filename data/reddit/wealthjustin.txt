Big money can do whatever they want 
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:55:29
I guess there is a reason that many got sent there so good to investigate Binance wallet but you should also investigate Bitmex... Bitmex is used by the Bitcoin movers. They can leverage there and make way more money as opposed to trading on Binance. If anything the money sent to exchanges other than Bitmex would be used to manipulate the price up or down through their bot walls so they can trade on Bitmex.
Binance they can not leverage. On Bitmex they can leverage up to x100. Therefore the ones who control that market would not bother trying to make profit from Binance when they can make u to 100x more on Bitmex.

I dont want to you won the argument 
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:32:13
Dude so are holders. It goes both ways you need strategy. Buy low and sell high can be done with either. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:28:18
Very true but you don't want to have that same mindset at the top of the Bull Market or even in the middle. It's a good idea to switch up strategies but for now I agree buy and hold everything at these prices. At the top of the bull market it's much wiser to go into cash and day trade the dips or arbitrage.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:35:16
No its all manipulation and strategy
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:07:27
Its a free market and big money will do whatever it takes to rape people. They don;t care about anything but money...they develop unpredictable strategies switching from buying to selling. They use bots and know how to drive the market up while pumping little cash and they know how to dump large amounts while keeping prices high. They also know how to drive prices down to start accumulating and they do it all over again. You cant beat them just have to do your best to follow them
These manipulators have been trading for decades in the stock market they can manipulate cryptos even easier. 
Anyone who thinks big money isnt in yet are idiots. As long as bot trading exists this manipulation will be easy for them.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:48:04
Calm down first dude its not that serious. That is with any currency thats not the kind of production I am talkign about anyways
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:02:36
Price was inflated but there was also a lot shortjing so you are correct as well. Bitcoin movers are focused on long term so we need corrections bitcoin I guess likes corrscting very dramatically

No! Remind yourself in 1 year

Unless you are the maipulators placing huge sell orders at resistance levels and huge buy orders at support levels.

ban yourself

Point is it's value creates production so it does not need to produce in the  way Buffet describes because it's production is value. But I am speaking about more than just Bitcoin about the technology itself. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:06:40
Only Google knows

@_date: 2018-05-15 20:52:04
Stay away from these bots especially because they need third-party access to your accounts
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:32:03
I agree 
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:04:47
The production isn't physical it is mental. It produces a system that allows people to be more in control of their own financial system. This is the first time in history people all over the world can create their own financial system without the government. So what is produced is a means to rely less on government. This is the first step in a movement away from government control. In the future the people will win. Bitcoin is the first piece of the puzzle.
Once the financial piece is in place we can start to take over our healthcare, school systems, etc. We will not need governments to manage anymore because only true decentralization can get rid of all the government waste/theft and make us more productive. Buffet thinks production in terms of money but bitcoins value is greater than just money. The technology produces a lot more than any other currency has ever done.

Dont underestimate technology you no nothing about it could be some code you dont even know so dont act like its not possible. you are not a government scientist now go away
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:46:14
I might die before it goes back up :( Ill try to remember to sell if it goes parabolic again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:25:43
But did you contribute to the original source code that is not released to public? Is it possible the source code released is not all there is to Bitcoin? Programs can run from multiple source codes. Dont act like the source code holds all the proof because it is just a public version which of course would be different then original
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:35:08
maybe :) and no I dont want to read lol jk

@_date: 2018-06-19 23:13:36
Bitcoin manipulators ruined the reputation of Bitcoin being a good investment by pushing it up to unnatural levels just to just to let it go down nearly as much in a long dragged out event.

So he may be Satsoshi? Anyways... does anyone know the projects he advises?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:23:59
You are invalid. You have no idea what you are talking about to underesitmate technology. Dont act like you have a PHD in blockchain. Burger boy. Programs can run from multiple source codes
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:50:22
When everyone thinks about smart contracts they tink in terms of creating coins and ico's on platforms like Ethereum and that is a small part of it that is really only good to launch businesses within the blockchain and does little for the outside world. Smart contracts potential has not been realized yet which will allow it to connect almost everything you can think of to the blockchain. Chainlink will own this market they already do as far as connecting the outside world to the blockchain... Nick Szabo even tweeted about mainstream adoptions coming to crypto because of Chainlink  Already rumored to be working with Microsoft, SWIFT with connections to 11,000+ banks, and so many other big players. They will make Bitcoin, Ethereum and all other coins more useful.
Andreas Antopolous and Gavin Woods also mentioned Chainlink in their new book as a way to fix the oracle and smart contracts problem  Many people sleep on Chainlink because of FUD campaigns but those are the investors that listen to the FUD instead of seeing how biggest players see Chainlink as essential to fixing smart contracts for mainstream use will miss out. 
I feel Chainlink will be take crypto the next level watch and see
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:49:09
you have the link?

@_date: 2018-06-13 18:57:35
But can the source code hide certain parts or the Bitcoin program?
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:13:33
Then why comment?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:11:49
What if the released source code is not the real source code?  Liek a white label?

Didn't know it would trigger like that its new dude.. I usualky seen 1 - 5 go off at a time but never like 50all at once
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:27:01
Its a simple pump notifier that informs me when alts or Bitcoin jumps 2.5% or more in x amount of secobds  but it works in browser so 100% safe. 
It just happened to trigger a massive alert. I only looked at it as a simple day trade tool to use with my chart analysis to predict price breakouts but it told me to sell Bitcoin when it went off like crazy because I've been strictly in Bitcoin and Chainlink
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:34:32
I doubt Bitcoin drop had anything to do with Coinbase going down
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:30:13
It helped me get out Bitcoin so its worth saving me from a $1500 drop obviously not shit for that reason alone
Thats $15000 saved if you have 10 Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:41:01
Its possible but regardless of that my bot informed me to sell.
I was trading Bitcoin so I use the bot alt action to decide when to sell.

So whats the halvening? Why would it make Bitcoin go up? I just read it means some miners would start losing money and would turn off their machines so why would it be good for the price if transactions become slower?
