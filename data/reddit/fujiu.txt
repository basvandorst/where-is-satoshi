Wow, I'm blown away that somebody fell for this bullshit..
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:13:07
This is pure speculation. At least give some resoning why you expect it this way...

Why don't you just use a BIP38 encrypted private key and tell the three others the password?
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:43:31
Any details that you can remember about the password could help you.. How you created it (e.g. from english words mixed with random numbers), how long it was, etc. For that amount you might consider getting professional help.

Yep, I'm also against that..

Looks like you have formulated a nice model that seems to explain past price movements pretty well. For numerous reasons, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will perform well in predicting the future price. If you believe it does, than I'd recommend acting accordingly. I personally believe that short- and mid-term price movements in bitcoin are extremly complex and therefore hard to predict.

The BIP38 implementation is designed to make brute forcing harder. Sure, it could still be done if the passphrase is weak. But my reasoning would be that it's far easier to remember a fairly secure passphrase compared to an abstract mathematical function on a private key.

Seems like you just had a typo in the address above. In this thread you wrote:

I am really curious how you met this guy and what made you trust him. Sorry about your loss btw :/

Fake gold is worth a lot less, despite looking pretty much identical.


Bitcoins don't corrode either. They can also never be destroyed, only lost.


That's true, but these uses can not explain why the gold price is so high compared to other elements that also just as rare and useful.
