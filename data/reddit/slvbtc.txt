So do merchants already do this now? Do they use a merchant specific wallet for their business that operates in this way if necessary? Or do all merchants just assume all btc buyers will be connected to the internet via data roaming 24/7.. just havent heard about this idea much and the few btc accepting merchants i have visited did not do this at all.. it should be integrated into all merchant specific wallets

Yea. I sold my car my house and my dog for btc coz it could rise 20%. Haha.

But it is so much more than that. Saying something is just cash ignores the way cash is created. Bitcoin is a global central bank (issuance), plus an electronic cash system (currency units), plus an electeonic payment mechanism (transactions), not to mention all the other use cases broadly defined by trust applications.

Heres the thing.
Selling bitcoin and paying cgt in dollar profits is fine, for now.
But what happens when people stop cashing out and just buy products and services with bitcoin. In theory you would then need to also sell bitcoin to pay the dollar value of your cgt payable at the time of your purchase. But what if banks are blocking bitcoin exchanges?
One of two things can happen. Either governments will mandate by law that banks HAVE to allow selling of btc so they can get their taxes, or governments will have to accept taxes directly in btc.
Either of those two inevitable outcomes is fantastic.
Interesting times ahead.

If bitpay were smart they would be doing this. I have a feeling though they will lag as usual. Perfect opportunity for btcpay to take their market share.
The birth of LN is going to be an explosion of new bitcoin services rising and old bitcoin services that are stuck in the past falling. 
Its just like whats happening with banks except on a much faster and shorter time scale.

My "opinion"
1) a mycelium investment could be considered an investment in the entire crypto ecosystem, or an investment in all blockchains. Because even if btc fails others will survive and mycelium will still be the one go to app for all blockchains. So yes it may not be as profitable as buying btc but it is like a blockchain hedge.
2) the btc value is irrellevant. Btc is the medium of exchange to turn usd into mycelium tokens and thats it. Mycelium tokens will represent the value of the company in usd.
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:21:17
Could be all those reasons.. OR it could just be the fact that btc-usd pair just broke upwards out of a massive bullish pennant consolidation pattern that was building for 6 months. 
Traders gonna Trade.

More people need to do this. But not enough do it yet. However I prefer the route of just boycotting coinbase all together until they stop sending thousands of separate transactions at once all at 450 sat per byte.

So we are in agreement then. The value of ethereum wont come from middlemen taking a cut, like the video suggests, it will come from the benefits users experience, just like I was alluding to with my previous example.
So then now that we both understand the guy in the video is naieve to say ethereum will have no value until ethereum "the company" can make money. First of all because ethereum isnt a company looking to make profit, its a decentralised protocol, and second because value is not derived from the abily of middlemen to take a cut.
The value of ethereum will be derived from the benefits, cost savings and time savings end users experience.
In that sense ethereum is priced forward. That is, it is given a current price based on those future expectations of benefits. I guess the question then becomes what are the current and future benefits of ethereum.
As for bitcoin we have one already and that is the ability to store and save money independently away from fallible banks and inflationary fiat currencies. That is bitcoins main value proposition today. And that is worth a tremendous amount of value.

So if I buy a tesla roadster and make my number plate "tsla stock" I should consider my self targeted for having made money riding the tesla stock boom? I should be worried that someone will target me, break into my house, hold me hostage, make me log in to my charles schwab account and withdraw everything to my bank, then make me transfer it all to an offshore bank account, where they have someone waiting to withdraw the entire amount in cash.
Somehow I dont see that as a common occourance.
I guess what your saying is people will assume every bitcoiner keeps a paper wallet in their sock draw?
No one with enough bitcoin to throw down cash on a $150,000 car keeps it all in their sock draw. Safe deposit boxes in private vaults are cheap and easily accessible. Plus there is a million other ways to store crypto that are even safer than that with more plausible deniability.

There are many derivation paths. There is bip32 39 44 49 84 etc.
Take a look at this site: 
Try to avoid typing your seed into an online website though. 
This is as far my technical knowledge goes. You might be able to find more info elsewhere.
If I was you I would try to figure out what wallet I used to generate the seed. If it was a desktop wallet i would search the computer for something I may have used in the past. If it was a mobile wallet I woukd visit my app store and check my list of previously downloaded apps.
Good luck!

If they dont want us then we dont need them.
Banks blockading transactions to and from exchanges, or closing bank accounts because of using a bitcoin exchange is fucking fantastic. 
Why? Because it shows everyone why we need bitcoin in the first place. If a banks wants peoples business then they better allow people to use their own money however they want to, and last time I checked bitcoin wasnt illegal.
It would be like samsung knocking on your door and taking back the galaxy s7 you bought off them because you also use an apple ipad.
Its beyond ridiculous. But it is great they are doing it. All they are doing is fighting the inevitable and in the process giving people even more reasons to want out of the banking system.

Dont give up.
If that seed holds btc then it also holds bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin plus, bitcoin diamond.  For real. These were forks of bitcoin that can be turned back into real bitcoin atthe prevailing exchange rate. So you might have much more bitcoin than you think.
Different wallets use different derivation paths. Try them all. Also the wallet takes time to sync. So dont dismiss it as soon as you see a zero balance, wait for it to sync. Also it should show you your transaction history, so dont give up until you see that atleast.

There can be a million different coinbases. But we only have one blockchain.
In the words of Kanye West: "Theres a million of you, theres only one of me". Sorry for that, i know bad choice of quote, but you get the point.
What do we prefer, loosing one of many exchanges? Or losing the blockchain?
Better to loose coinbase and let another more efficient entrant replace them, rather than destroying our one and only blockchain.
Coinbase, its time for a divorce, go marry your side chick Bcash. You wont be missed.

Yes the whole point of a POS system is to keep track of how many items you sold, your profit margin, inventory available etc etc.
So a wallet alone doesnt really integrate with all that.
You need to accept bitcoin through a point of sale app so it can integrate with all your business needs, record keeping and reports.
Trying to accept bitcoin separately just makes your business more confusing.
People need one POS app where they can accept cash, bitcoin and cards so as to make the integration with running their business seemless. Trying to tack on a bitcoin wallet separately just makes everything a big messy headache.
Its quite stupid to expect bitcoin to be accepted by merchants if it cant integrate into their existing POS suite. Not because its hard to accept bitcoin, but because businesses need all their operating info in one place to keep track of everything.
Bitcoin wont be accepted by business until it is an option on their POS system or app IMO.

What we need is a LN POS app.
A complete copy and paste of a traditional small business POS app, except with payments recieved either by cash or LN. Avoiding those horrible credit cards all together.

You are not serious are you. Do you even know how inflation works.
Those numbers are denominated in euros!!
Over time as more money is created that dilutes the total supply making your money worth less in terms of goods and services. This is experienced in the form of larger denominations of euros buying less. The fact that there is more disposable income denominated in euros on average just means the value of the euro is falling.
Its exactly the same as saying everyone is better off because they used to make 10 euros a day and now they make 100 euros a day. Disregarding the fact that everything now costs 20 times as much.
Yes people have more disposable income in euros but those euros buy less now than they did 50 years ago.
Its almost like your trying to imply that prices havent inceased since the 50s.

In theory would it be possible for me to run my LN node from my laptop at home, always on. And then interact with it from my smart phone?

Every modern tablet has a secure element already.
Then you have an always on LN POS that is as secure as a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:12:11
Good question.
I know when you set up an eclair LN testnet wallet it gives you a 24 word seed. Thats your back-up.
Also ledger is looking into a LN hardware wallet. They have the ledger trustlet app already which uses your phones secure element. They may be building something along these lines, which would mean you can always be online while remaining completely secure because everything is still signed within the secure element.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:49:07
Ok cool i get it. 
So if i run my own LN node to send and receive payments then i need to be online. But in reality average users will use LN wallets and those wallet services will be like email servers, always online to make sure you get your money.
So the FUD is from people who think that you need to run your own LN node, when in reality most people will outsource this to their wallet software.
For example i use Mycelium LN wallet. Myceliums servers make sure i can always get paid even my phone is offline. 
Saying you need to be online to recieve a LN payment is like implying every internet user runs their own email server, which is not the case obviously.

You think 1 in 1000 people own bitcoin when its more like 1 in 10 its just not obvious at all. 
Most of my closest family members have no idea I own btc and ive been in this since before gox got goxxed.

Digitizing gold is literally like trying to digitize scarcity. Bitcoin is already digitized scarcity.
Digitized gold has nothing to do with gold and everything to do with digitized scarcity.
Goldmoney is digitized scarcity plus digital utility. Bitcoin is also digitized scarcity plus digital utility. The only difference is goldmoney uses physical gold with custodial counterparty risk to achieve that scarcity factor, while bitcoins scarcity is algorthimically based and mathematically provable requiring zero counterparty risk.
Bitcoin is beyond superior to goldmoney.
Bitcoin has intrinsic value (scarcity and utility) while goldmoney has utility but only extrinsic artificial scarcity rife with counterparty risk.

So humanity being able to communicate via email instantly and globally instead of sending a letter is worthless? I dont remember paying money to send an email.
What the internet allows us to do as a global society holds tremendous value, even if there are no companies there to make money off of it.
Let me ask you a question. What if google amazon facebook twitter ebay and everything else were not for-profit companies, but instead they were free to use decentralised protocols. 
All the good stuff we use today on the internet would still be there without companies making profit. Would that mean the internet was worthless, just because there were no middle men taking a cut? No of course not, the internet would still hold tremendous value to our society.
Guess what. Ethereum is all about Dapps (decentralised apps) aka, autonomous un-owned "companies".
Saying ethereum is worth zero because there are no middle men taking a cut is a very naieve view point on his behalf.

The point being this podcast shows how he is slowly opening up to it. He called it "money", he experienced how powerful donations and tipping with bitcoin can be, and he now wants to accumulate more.

What if i own gold. And gold goes to 100k per ounce. Then I buy a lambo by selling some gold and make my number plate "TNX GLD".
Does that mean I should expect to be targeted as most people think gold owners keep their gold in physical form in their home, the same as crypto owners?
Gold is a million times easier to steal than crypto as its gonna be in a safe in someones home. A seed could be hidden in any number of places and many decoys set up along with just the fact 95% of your holdings could easily be in a safe deposit box in a private vault.
I have a feeling anyone buying an expensive car with btc profits and then giving it a btc related number plate is going to implement some serious security and redundancy for their crypto holdings.
One such scenario is to hold 95% of your holdings in a safe deposit box, and the other 5% in a hardware wallet with multiple decoys.
If anyone targeted you and forced their way into your home, held you hostage etc you can at most give them 5% of your holdings without leaving the house and taking them with you to the vault. And at best convince them all you have access to in your home is an even smaller amount.
Alot of people keep their life savings in cash in their home hidden away as banks are a no-no for them. Thats way more dangerous than hiding a seed.
And forget a licence plate, what about just being a prominent figure. Should brian armstrong fear for his life because hes the founder of coinbase and therefore obviously must keep all of his holdings on a paper wallet on his sock draw.
Again, if you own large amouts of crypto and are willing to tell the world, then its safe to assume that individual has some serious security and redundancy set up to the point where the funds are untouchable even if held at gun point, just like people who are fiat rich.
The attacker would be better off stealing your car or expensive jewlery in your home rather than trying to fuck around with extracting crypto. And thats the same as any fiat rich individual.
I think anyone that is paranoid about this is paranoid because they themselves have their entire holdings kept in their sock draw.

You pay taxes, 50% of those taxes go to pay lazy inept inefficient government workers that would get fired in 2 seconds if they were working for a private company. Then the next 30% goes to lining the pockets of politicians paying them exorbitant salaries and flying them around the country in private jets dining at the most expensive restaurants etc. Finally the last 20% goes to what you want it to go to like roads schools and hospitals, **except** government always overpays for sub-par quality as they are spending other peoples money so arnt careful with it, in other words they dont shop around for the best deal.
No one is against public services, what people are against is the blatant waste and corruption.
Taxes in the way they are handled now are literally like performing a blood transfusion from your left arm to your right arm and spilling half of the blood on the floor in the process.
If taxes were deposited into a blockchain smart contract and the people voted directly on where their taxes were to be spent and it was all transparent so we could follow every cent then it would be a different story. Unfortuneately a large majority of all your tax dollars are wasted.

Money systems dont need to have value, there is nothing valuable about a piece of paper with 100 written on it or a string of numbers and letters. What they do is represent the value that surrounds us. They store value, value itself being nothing more than something almost imaginary and invisible that we concertedly ascribe to things. "Value" is just everyone deciding concurrently that something has value, all value is subjective.
So money systems are just storage containers and transfer mechanisms for holding and communicating the invisible "value" we ascribe to the things around us. 
Its so obvious that the best form of money be purely digital.

If banks block people from buying and selling, guess what, to get bitcoin people will have to start earning it by selling goods and services for btc. This increases adoption because it increases the incentive for merchants to accept bitcoin.
We see this everywhere it is hard to buy and sell bitcoin. Even in australia, it is hard to buy large amounts through exchanges so people are starting to sell their investment properties directly for bitcoin.
If banks want to block exchanges all they are doing is incentivizing people to accept btc directly, which actually grows adoption.

Saif's claim is that fiat reverting back to a gold standard would hurt bitcoins value proposition.
Even fiat backed by gold doesnt have the boarderless, censorship resistant, open, permissionless properties that also make bitcoin better. Fiat can't even do these things realistically.
Can anyone build a banking app for the dollar without asking the financial regulator for permission? Is the dollar programmable? Is the dollar boarderless and politically neutral? Can I send dollars to wikileaks?
Going back to a gold standard would be beneficial but most people think the dollar still is backed by gold so its not going to change much. However making the dollar digital, programmable, permissionless, censorship resistant and politically neutral along with gold backing could hurt bitcoin. But do you really think any government would do that? Its one thing giving up the ability to print money its another thing to relinquish all political control completely. Dont hold your breath.
Bitcoin represents an open liberal free society, the dollar is the polar opposite of that whether its backed by gold or not.
Saying a return to the gold standard would hurt bitcoin would be akin to saying if a fax machine could send VHS tapes it would hurt the internet.

As products and services become more digital you need to compete with other companies that are also digital and therefore globally mobile. Staying in a country that is over regulated and over taxed means you lose customers to other global companies that have the benefit of "ease of doing business" and have a lower cost of doing business and can therefore provide better products at a lower price than you.
Profit incentives are the foundation of capitalism, without profit incentives capitalism wouldnt work. If Apple had to produce all of its products in the US it would already be out of business.
If you want businesses to stay at home then make your home competative. Foster innovation and ingenuity instead of stifling it, take care of businesses instead of scaring them away.

Bitcoin has value because it is scarce and has utility but its exact price is determined by people buying it and selling it on exchanges which is what determines its last or most recent price. No different than gold or stocks or forex.

Money systems dont need to have value, there is nothing valuable about a piece of paper with 100 written on it or a string of numbers and letters. What they do is represent the value that surrounds us. They store value, value itself being nothing more than something almost imaginary and invisible that we concertedly ascribe to things. "Value" is just everyone deciding concurrently that something has value, all value is subjective.
So money systems are just storage containers and transfer mechanisms for holding and communicating the invisible "value" we ascribe to the things around us. 
Its so obvious that the best form of money be purely digital.

Yes one persons spending is another persons income, very true. Deflationary currencies incentivise savings which leads to more spending. Inflationary currencies incentivise consumption which is good for spending in the very short term but absolutely horrible for spending in the long term because inflation causes immediate consumption without any savings or investment first. Deflation is bad for spending in the immediate short term (so people go without plastic crap they dont need anyway) but good for sustainable spending in the long term, while inflation is good short term (sugar high) but horrible long term as it errodes capital investment and wealth overall.
People hoarding money is just another term for saving. You seem to think people will never spend money. You need to look into time value of money and understand that we all die so everyone prefers something today over something next year. No one goes without a phone now because next year it will be slightly cheaper. No one starves thsmselves because next year that loaf of bread will be cheaper. People need to live their lifes in the present.
Inflation is good for governments and bad for the general public. Deflation is good for the general public and bad for governments. Thats all you need to know. If you believe we need inflation and that deflation is bad then you have been educated through the lense of the state.

"Internets are the inevitable evolution that communication will take, but the form of internet it will take is still far up in the air."
Bitcoin is a network protocol not a website. Bitcoin is a platform not a product.
You can look at some of the early protocols supported by the Cisco (company) multiprotocol routers. OSI Connectionless-mode Network Service with CLNS and TP4 would be the closest analogy to TCP/IP. Apple used AppleTalk and AFP over a DDP transport, but they eventually migrated all of that to IP transport, instead.
There will be much competition for a value transfer protocol but all value transfer traffic will eventually be migrated to one value transfer protocol. There will be other blockchains for compute and logic perhaps, but we are talking about value transfer specifically.

Yea if some tiny micro nation like Tuvalu made bitcoin their national currency no one would care. It would take a G20 country doing it to make the other big nations take it seriously.
Also if a G20 country did do it other G20 countries would have to recognise bitcoin as foreign currency or risk causing a breakdown of the G20 accord entirely.
Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa are all G20 nations. I can very easily see one of those economies collapsing in the not so distant future and the population adopting bitcoin while simultaneously electing a leader who will make it legal tender.

Bitcoin was born out of a recession. If it dies because of a recession then WTF haha.
Bitcoin does well in 2 main recessionary scenarios.
1) A financial crisis that sees banks collapsing.
2) A soverign debt crisis that sees investors abandonning treasuries.
With the amount of debt, margin and leverage in the system today any recession will be either of the above two scenarios. It is literally impossible today to have developed nation recession where the global debt bomb doesnt explode.

My point was it takes a certain level of arrogance to assume its nothing more than a scam without doing any research.
Maybe arrogance is too strong of a word. Perhaps a better word is just laziness.
In any case this recent 2017 price rise is motivating people to get out of their own way and do a tiny bit of research. 
And my main opinion holds, which is that a tipping point of society reaching a level of paradigm shift is inevitable.

You are a special kind of stupid..
Deflationary currencies incentivise savings, without savings first you cant spend or invest so you need deflation to incentivise savings which leads to investment which leads to wealth which leads to spending which leads to more wealth. Inflationary currencies incentivise immediate consumption which destroys savings and therefore destroys investment which then destroys wealth.
Deflation: savings =&gt; investment =&gt; wealth =&gt; spending =&gt; prosperity.
Inflation: consumption =&gt; poverty.
In a deflationary system like gold and bitcoin debt is not needed to afford homes and cars. Under the gold standard people could save the entire amount for a median priced single family home within 5 years. Under an inflationary system the currency devalues so much it takes 10 years just to save a 10% deposit and debt is required for the rest. If debt is needed to live then your economy is sick as fuck not prosperous.

Thats why its going to be a choice they have to make. Wechat and alipay already dominate, but they use the yuan (albeit a digital yuan), and if the yuan is a fiat currency it will always lose value to bitcoin over time.
Wechat and alipay are essentially taking in real yuan and issuing digital yuan on their platform. Its still the yuan. The yuan is devalued constantly on purpose which is worse than slow but steady inflation. The choice will be an easy one.

In 2008 the price of gold fell 25% from january until september.
In september 2008 the stock market crashed.
When the stock market crashed everyone flocked to gold and it rose substantially after that for 3 straight years.
The reason gold sold off for all of 2008 up until the stock market crash was because the economy was declining. Property was sliding lower, GDP was negative, people were having a hard time in general and selling gold to cover other expenses caused by being in a recession. But as soon as there was a financial panic in the form of a stock market crash gold shot higher, along with other percieved safe havens like treasuries.
So expect gold and bitcoin to go sideways or lower as the economy has a hard time and re-enters a recession. But as soon as there is a trigger for a financial panic like a stock market crash expect both to shoot higher. Of course also in line with lower interest rates and higher bond prices.
Albeit this time there is a caveat with bonds/treasuries. In 2008 there was deflation, so not a problem for low rates and QE. but if this time around we see inflation hold steady or start rising even though the fed funds rate is zero then bonds may sell off also along side stocks.
Final note: this all assumes bitcoin is considered as a safe haven in a panic. In a panic people buy what they know and the goal is protect what you have, not necessarily to make money. So if gold is already there why take a chance on bitcoin with your wealth. Also its easy to switch from stocks to a gold ETF, but near impossible to switch from stocks to bitcoin. Unless a bitcoin ETF has launched before the next financial crisis.
So bitcoin is still 50/50 as to whether it will rise in a stock market crash or not.
One thing that is for sure though is if banks fail during a crisis bitcoin shoots higher. But governments always bail out banks. So perhaps bitcoin falls with stocks until banks fail or we see a major economy go through a soverign debt crisis and currency crisis.
No one wants the pain that comes with a soverign debt crisis, so bitcoin really is a hedge against the absolute worst case scenario.
Much better to just see the economy slowly roll along while bitcoin slowly takes over.
One final FINAL note: bitcoin is tiny! It takes alot of "safety seeking" to push the price of gold higher. But if just 1% of the money seeking safety goes into bitcoin instead of gold, then bitcoin will rise more percentage wise than gold, and this is something to think about.
**This pertains to US markets only. This is my naieve opinion and not financial advice.**

A government doesnt have to accept bitcoin in taxes directly. Smart people will hack bitcoin onto the tax department just like they hacked bitcoin onto Amazon through purse.io.
A government will never accept taxes in anything other than their own currency because that would send a huge signal that not even the government wants their own currency. They force fiat for taxes until their fiat experiences a catastrophic collapse in demand, at which point the only revenue source for the government will be crypto! At which point its game over and bitcoin automatically defaults to leagal tender.
But until that time some smart devs will hack it onto the system through other means.

Mainly governmental corruption, for example Zimbabwe and Venezuela who both banned crypto. But as described in my post above even governmental corruption cannot overcome the combination of decentralization, regulatory arbitrage, rule of law and black markets.
Bitcoin will always be used somewhere. Also as it is a global currency, if it is used globally countries who rely on tourism can only ban it to the detriment of their own economy. If i use bitcoin for everything and I want a holiday I will travel to the countries where bitcoin is accepted and avoid the countries where bitcoin is illegal.
Also in countries with a strong rule of law and solid democratic process, all it takes is people voting into power a candidate who runs on the promise of making bitcoin legal tender.

Consumer prices stable. Wages in a 10% band over 25 years averaging -0.4% per year this equates to a CPI of +0.4% per year, far better than 2% or 5% or 10% or 10,000%.
Also you cant look at economic outcomes  under fiat and inflationary monetary policy when talking about a limited supply monetary policy.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:43:10
Its driven by the same dynamic as all markets. 
Greed and fear.
Greed causes the price to rise (bitcoin is the future etc).
Fear causes the price to fall (bitcoin is a joke and a scam etc).
The price reflects these emotions and becuase these emotons are so strong in bitcoin the price swings wildly. In other words its easy for people to change their mind and perception as to whether bitcoin is the future or just a scam. 
As time goes on the final outcome will become more obvious and volatility will fall.
Volatility has been trending down since bitcoins inception. If this trend continues we will have the same amount of volatility as gold in 2 years, and the same amount of volatility as major currencies in 4 to 5 years.

So human genetics have changed over the last 150 years to prefer war, poor art form and less prosperity? Ok...
Hard money subconciously makes us value the future more over the present, hence more time is dedicated to great artwork and architecture, savings and capital investment is favoured more over wasteful consumption and finally hard money makes it impossible for governments to fund a military with the printing press. This has nothing to do with genetics and everything to do with our environment, money being the most important factor within our environment.

60% of the total supply of a currency in the hands of 0.1% of the population, all with a long term investment mind set..  Its the same as saying lets reset Gold, put it all back in the earths crust except for 60% of it which we will give to 0.1% of the population, "now the rest of you 99.9% better get to work fighting over the gold thats left, and by the way the rest is really freaking hard to find muahaha"..  that would never fly and people would say fuck that shit im gonna use Silver instead! 
Gold was initially distributed in a very fairer manner as it was originally used as jewlery and decoration before it became a universal form of money.. i guess what im saying is that protocols with tokens such as Ethereum and Storj are not only already distributed in a much fairer fashion due to the nature of their crowd sales, but their tokens will be initially used as a resource to aquire cloud storage or use decentralised apps, meaning distribution will end up being far fairer than bitcoin. The other uses such as cloud storage will also drive mainstream adoption faster than bitcoin.. So they are tokens that mimic bitcoins currency aspect, but will be held by many more people, therefore will naturally be used as money over time.. and to top it all off Ethereum's Ether is far better at being money than even bitcoin is!! 
I predict Bitcoin will remain prevelant but as these other platforms gain traction they will over take bitcoin in usage and because more people will end up owning ether than bitcoin it will naturally become the default currency. It might not be ether, but I predict the token that gains the most usage (the platform with the most mainstream usefulness) will also win as currency.. Its happened before with mobile money, Mpesa was not the first to market but won because of the amount of shops in Kenya that offered a point of sale for the currency, same thing with crypto, the most used and easiest accessed will win, and a token that everyone wants so they can access Ethereum or Storj will beat bitcoin simply because there will be more people using it! 
Bitcoin itself has a lot of regulatory head winds ahead too, mainstream public just dont get the point of bitcoin, but they get the point of cloud storage and decentralised apps.. and if that wasnt enough bitcoin has a huge target painted on its back, it will be easy for regulators to stifle its growth, or governments to find an excuse to ban it, but tell me who is going to say that a platform for decentralised cloud storage or decentralised apps is a way for terrorists to launder money? That label will stay with bitcoin forever now, and if someone says storj will be used to launder money you can simply say thats bitcoin and dark wallets department! 
Its not a bad thing if Ethereum ends up with more traction than bitcoin, Its a good thing, fairer monetary distribution, a better form of money than bitcoin, a platform that is cheaper and easier to innovate on than bitcoin.. and the kicker, I would rather live in a future where the main global financial and economic operating platform is called Ethereum not Bitcoin.. :)

Im not saying bitcoin will magiclly bring equality to the world. That is impossible whether under capitalism or communism.
Im saying this was the most egalitarian method to introduce a new form of money. If supply was limited from the begining that would have caused much higher prices and left early adopters (average people) with less btc therefore leaving more for corrupt institutions to buy up later with their massive amounts of fiat dollars.
I think you confuse the word egalitarian with equality.
On that note, inflation resistant bitcoin promotes monetary equality over time because it doesnt let prices rise faster than wages like fiat does. If anything, under bitcoin, wages will remain stable and prices will fall slightly year on year allowing people to feel the effect of natural wage increases without employers even raising wages, leaving people far better off over time.
So bitcoin was introduced in the most egalitarian way possible, and will not magically eliminate inequailty but will greatly reduce inequality over the next 50 years. What is bad about that.
How would you have done it differently? Give all the bitcoin to the IMF to distribute equally to all citizens and unborn humans??? Because for sure they are trustworthy enough to do that...

Maybe you are 85, in which case you might be correct.
But bitcoin can have low volatility while it is rising. 
Here is bitcoins volatility index.
Notice how volatility is reducing over time as market cap grows. We just had the biggest percentage increase in 2017 yet volatility was lower than all other previous bubbles even though those previous bubbles were smaller in terms of percentage increase and market cap growth.
Volatility is reducing over time naturally and in 5 years bitcoin/usd volatility might well be lower than euro/usd volatility.
Again, the goal is not to be stable against fiat, it is to have low volatility against fiat.

By your logic a business reducing its prices must make its revenue fall. I guess a business rising its prices should then make revenue increase!?
GTFO of here with that keynesian crap..
A deflationary currency incentivses savings which is where capital investment comes from and economic growth comes from capital investment. Therefore a deflationary currency incentivises economic growth. 
Time value of money always incentivises consumption too.
What makes you spend more money? Having a credit card because inflation means you cant afford to pay for a car with savings, or having substantial savings and seeing the price of the car fall by 1% per year.
Its obvioys the latter is what drives consumption not inflation.
A country with a deflationary main currency results in more savings therefore more economic growth, higher wages, and therefore more consumption.
Its not a zero sum game where you either have savings or consumption. With a deflationary currency you have both higher savings and higher consumption.

Is TNT being ported over to the proof network as proof's native token? Source please.

the only reason gold was needed previously was to limit the supply of currency.. bitcoin does not need that, it would just be an extra burden.. I believe people will still hold gold in the future the same as they hold now, just incase of a catastrophic failure in the system (wether thats the current system or bitcoin).. im sure people not as comfortable with bitcoin will use it becasue of its utility but still hold bullion just incase

I believe for bitcoin to survive (instead of the mainstream simply choosing a different 'fairer distribution' coin like Ethereum) satoshi will either have to prove who he is and that he does not control the large amount of initially mined bitcoin, or he will have to do an airdrop of that initially mined btc to late adopters (directly through fb or similar) If that happens btc has a chance of surviving.. If not then there is no way the other 7billion ppl will commit to a system that is  so unfairly distributed and would actually increase inequality!!

the rise and rise of bitcoin focused on mildly amusing, now irrellevant stories. Having jumped into bitcoin in early 2013 and following all the exciting developments in this space, I felt like the documentary was showing a very narrow picture of what has been happening. 
They didnt show the online communities like reddit or other Bitcoin talk forums, how large the global community actually is and how we all share info in this space, hence the probability that bitcoin will be spread and adopted much faster than the internet.
They showed only a handful of main start ups when in fact there are hundreds, which are doing more advanced things than just operating as exchanges. Coinapault being the only exception in the film, and even then they didnt discuss the implications of banking the underbanked, or the vast possibilities this technology will allow in terms of innovation.
They didnt show influential figures like Richard Branson, Marc Andreessen, Chamath Palihapitiya, Tim Draper, Barry Silbert etc speaking about bitcoin, or even mention the massive amount of venture capital flowing into the space.
They didnt touch on the greater effects of bitcoin for the unbanked or reference M-pesa as an example of whats possible with digital currency.
They didnt show how vast the mining network is, the farms in the U.S and China which are breathtaking.
They didnt show any epic talks from large conferences.
They didnt even show Andreas Antonopolous talking!
I feel like this doco was showing things that are either vastly out dated now or not representative of the space!
I send friends and family videos all the time but wont be sharing this doco as it wont help my cause, I think the recent Canadian senate hearing with Andreas, is a far better source of information, clarity and legitimacy than the rise and rise of bitcoin.

Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law. It differs from commodity money, which is based on a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, 
Lets change this wiki and add:
There is also cryptographic money, based on modern technologies such as blockchain, proof-of-work and public key cryptogragphy. This is arguably the most pure and most transparent form of money created to date.

first, oddly enough your fiat has been loosing 1-2% compared with the CPI.. the base inflation rate of the US dollar is a different beast, completely different number from the CPI.
Second, If we priced in gold, prices would be stable if not slightly coming down in value year by year, fiat would be looking like it was falling off a cliff, and btc would look like it was climbing just not as fast.

A business page on fb is free, as are "likes" to spread the popularity of your page! It is the only free way to advertise among your peers and therefore your peers friends. 
Recognise the saying "6 degrees of separation". If ppl with small businesses on fb had incentive to adopt bitcoin, apart from the obvious economic incentives that they cant yet comprehend, this could strengthen the network effect of bitcoin considerably

yes they do! they dont comprehend the entire concept of bitcoin from the first 2 minute video they watch, they take away about 10% of what its trying to portray, and 'no arbitrary limits' sticks in their minds, along with 'miners create bitcoins'! No where in the video does it state that bitcoins are created at a set amount, at a set time, over a period of time! it is a massive overlook! Again the only reason bitcoin will work is because of its limited supply, who wants to be a part of a digital currency that is simply created by computers at will! thats what this video makes it look like!
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:31:14
Think of the mining incentive structure. All this does is provide an incentive to learn about bitcoin, once they learn about it bitcoin will stand on its own merit! 
Saying "I shouldn't have to bribe someone with a like to use it" is like saying I shouldn't have to bribe a miner with newly issued btc because it should stand on its own merit.

Peter is quite close with Stefan Molyneux, who is a big Bitcoin supporter. I think Peter is being slowly made aware of the underlying technology but is still very skeptical, it was nice this time to see him only arguing against the price and not the tech. He obviously thinks the price is too high, he is the "bubble" expert after all (perhaps he wants to help drive the price lower so he can pick up btc as cheap as possible) otherwise why is he still talking about it.. Once we start another bull run he may even jump on board, he may even own some btc now after the recent crash! ;) If btc doesent fail its inevitable, he will have no choice long term.. also was funny seeing Matt Miller on Bloomberg talking about Bitcoin in a segment with Gold, mainstream media are putting them both in the same category

If peters arguments are valid then digital mobile money like Mpesa shouldnt be working. Safaricom keeps Mpesas transactions reconciled, voluntary individuals keep Bitcoins transactions reconciled. They are both very similar.
Peters arguments revolve mainly around the price. It dosent matter if one bitcoin is $400 or $4 it still works the same, 1 btc is always worth 1 btc, and 1 btc will always have usefulness as a medium of exchange. As an investment thats another story, but I will always be able to use bitcoin to transfer value instantly for free, circle will help this process, more infrastructure will enhance the ease of use.
The thing I dont get with peters 'store of value' argument is that Gold is in the exact same position, yet he pumps Gold at every chance! Gold has been a terrible store of value over the last 2 years, the irony is Bitcoins store of value attributes mimic gold! yet he argues against Bitcoins lack of store of value capabilities. If he truely believed Bitcoin will fail because it is volatile compared to the dollar then he would have to also believe that Gold will have the same fate!!

Fiat only appears stable! becasue all major currencies are falling along side eachother.. If you measure fiat in gold (as gold is stable in qantity), then the last 10 years has seen a huge percentage decline in fiat value! saying the dollar is stable and gold is volatile, is the same as saying 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin still, its the dollar thats volatile! its just perspective.. Its just that we price in dollars, if we priced in btc or gold then fiat would look fukt up!

@_date: 2014-10-13 16:24:21
lets critique this! 
First, we all know he thinks stop losses show up in the order book of bitstamp, which they do not. and that no exchange allows for shorting bitcoin, which is false! He goes on in this podcast to again detract from bitcoins price (which I believe is his way to try and drive the price down so he can finally buy in at the best price). 
He doesnt know the difference between Marc Andreessen ( the creator of Netscape and considered the god father of the internet) and Tim Draper (the VC who bought the auctioned btc) that is a huge display of ignorance! 
Then later in the podcast he interviews Peter Thiel, who has invested in Bitcoin start-ups, and they even talk about his 'Thiel Fellowship' which has enabled Vitalik Buterin to develop Ethereum. The conversation drifts towards the inevitable monetary collapse and global currency crisis, and thats when it sounds like Peter Thiel is about to mention BTC and coinsidently all of a sudden it sounds like the interview is edited, cut, and he says "well thats all we have time for" etc.. 
Peter Schiff you will wake up soon enough! 
Gold vs Bitcoin, in a currency crisis and monetary collapse.. If you ask me I believe the majority of the population are more comfortable buying a decentralised currency from their laptop and using it on their phone, rather than lining up at a dealer to buy gold coins which they cant do anything with except lock in a safe! My MOTHER would rather hedge economic uncertanty online with a USEFUL technology, than go down to the local dealer and buy a piece of metal that can only sit there and look shiny!
Peter, I know you will look for this reddit post and read these comments because you cant stop talking about Bitcoin, I admire your economic outlook and hope you will eventually see that Blockchain tech is the only practical way forward for liberty and human kind. The sooner you understand bitcoin the better, Euro Pacific  Bank could be the first bank to utilize and support blockchain technology! you would be way ahead of the game! This opportunity will not last long..

This is a perfect example of how government regulation will drive non-jurisdictional technologies innovation and benefits off shore to more accomodating geographic locations..

Bitcoin is neutral, but governments are not, the only loosers in this game will be governments and their countries population..

1) modern-experimental-Keynesian economics, is driven by debt therefore deflation is extremely bad.. Sound money systems (Austrian economic theory) like GOLD, is deflationary in nature and a benefit to the whole of society, instead of leeching economic prosperity like the current system, sound money rewards savings, boosts capital investment and drives innovation and production, all we do today is encourage debt that creates un-productive wealth effects temporarily! America was built on sound money and savings, not debt! Deflation undermines the current system as it stands, therefore modern economists warn of it as it harms the system.. deflation under sound money theory helps grow economies, and rewards societies that are innovative and productive, by reducing the cost of living! constant 2% inflation in the face of technology that should reduce our cost of living is a disease!
2) If Bitcoin fails or gets disrupted, it will be because 5 million people own half of the total supply, and one wallet contains something like 10 percent. The distribution curve supports speculation, not global wealth equality. Unless we end up in a world of 10 or 20 main crypto's that work as a network effect together, and wallets let you use them all along with merchants accepting them all, then thats a mush fairer system.. also we will still pay our taxes, just for transparent blockchain voted reasons, so governments (wether they be centralised organisations or DAO's) will still end up with a large portion to fund the well being of the citizens.

some banks offer free remittance for india only, which still takes an annoying amount of time, and the bangladeshi mother most probably dosent have a bank account to begin with. I hear your point, but i see a not so distant future where bitcoin is sent to the bangladeshi mother who can access the btc with her dumb phone via sms.

The concept of cryptocurrency as a whole brings choice. If somehow bitcoin gets turned into fedcoin then so be it. I will use whatever else is better at the time.
If bitcoin can compete with 200+ currencies forced onto the population, then another coin can compete with a fedcoin.
Plus who gets to control this one world fed coin? Which country is going to stand by why all their citizens use a currency controlled by their enemy nation.. its either create 200+ fed coins, one for each country or give in to decentralization completely and use bitcoin. Atleast that way if you dont control your own countries currency then atleast another enemy country doesnt.
The cat is out if the bag. Crypto means we finally have choice and that choice is unstoppable.
They can try anything they want but they can not remove choice from us after the invention of bitcoin.

Most new tech is 10 year technology, im saying that it would have been smarter to have a distribution curve that had only released around 10% of all coins by the 10th year instead of 60%.. this would have actually made the value of each coin greater and the profits for the early adoptors would have therefore been the same in dollar terms! yet the currency would then be fairer after mainstream adoption, more like gold was (60% of all gold was not uncovered in the first 5 years after its discovery)

But then why on earth would you pay tax on an event that made you more bitcoin if bitcoin has the ability to crash to zero tomorrow? So you make a trade between eth and btc and back again and pay your CGT, but then btc loses 50% 6 months later, so you paid tax on your investment then lost half of your investment.. CGT is only applicable when you realise a dollar (fiat) profit.

This kind of attack is self imposed. If there was a floating average blocksize cap then this couldnt happen. Similarly if there was no cap at all this couldnt happen either.

This is a huge risk. If they can do it they will do it eventually. We need protocol level fungibility and we need it now. 
I love mimble wimble, there is no trace of any transaction.. its as if everything on the blockchain is updated in real time without any record of transactions whatsoever. Unfortunately that wont integrate into bitcoin if im correct.
I am confident core will fix this. Im just worried they may not do it before they end up co-oped by governments, which is probably inevitable.

So to sum it up.. 
segwit fixs all the issues steming from full blocks (as soon as wallets are ready, which they are incentived to do). And also allows time to scale infinitely with LN! And also LN will fix fungibility, and its all done in a safe way.
Bitcoin unlimited tries to scale entirely on chain allowing no off chain solutions at all, with no fix for fungibility, with a 99% chance of a contentious HF which will no doubt create 2 bitcoins and immense confusion for newbies.
The only argument for BU is that censorship on reddit means segwit is bad, even though the censoring is being done by a bitcoin "fan" not the core devs.
The obvious solution is to implement segwit and then if we still need bigger blocks it will be done in a non-contentious environment. This is the best way to make both sides happy.
BU has no way to make both sides happy and is therefore by definition more controlling of the entire community. Something Roger should be against but isnt for some reason.

Would be epic if core actually started a diversification initiative and made sure there was atleast one developer from every country on the core team.

What I dont understand about PoS is this: Mining makes bitcoin immutable as it takes electricity to hash, and that electricity usage provides a hash that can only be achieved with that large amount of electricity.

People who believe in Bitcoin enough to actually use it as a currency, and not just speculate, know everything that is happening behind the scenes, therefore understand the true growth it is experiencing and see that it is the strongest it has ever been.
That is rare in a free market currency
Also that is a very small group of people, mostly the ones who bought in below $10, which is why the price may go there in the near term.. however that does not void my argument.

Every other asset or security, when you trade one for another there is a recorded dollar settlement inbetween even if you dont see it, either with a brokerage or a lawyer or a conveyancer is recording a dollar settlement. With bitcoin that fiat settlement inbetween does not exist with any brokerage or conveyancer and is therefore a barter transaction.
Bitcoin is considered property. If i owned property that does not need a brokerage or conveyancer, lets say a diamond, and i found somebody who had the same dollar value of pearls, and we swapped them. There is no capital gain as you are swapping for the same value in an asset where there was no need to go back into fiat inbetween. Therefore not a taxable event. Bitcoin to eth back to bitcoin is the same. Not a taxable event.

no sarcasm, just stating facts.. People who believe in Bitcoin enough to actually *use* it as a currency, know everything that is happening behind the scenes, therefore understand the true growth it is experiencing and see that it is the strongest it has ever been. 
So I am correct in saying Bitcoin embodies unprecedented confidence as a free market, non-enforced currency, with only Gold coming close to this phenomenon historically. (However, even then, when Gold collapsed in 1980 it wasn't considered money, let alone a means of payment.) Bitcoin is already recognized as a more legitimate means of payment for goods and services than Gold was 1980. Therefore making Bitcoin historically **the first free market, non-enforced, currency to experience an 85% collapse in one year, and still be considered by all of its 'users' to be fundamentally stronger than ever!.**
A true testament to the power of Bitcoin as a currency.

I understand you can not host a full node just going from the PoW hash, thats why syncing with the blockchain is still required. However, my idea is to take the entire blockchain and keep a factom audit trail of hashes which are hashed into the bitcoin blockchain itself, so to start hosting a node you only need to sync with the factom hash network instead of the entire blockchain (something like that).. like i said im probably missing some massive technical points in my thinking.. But, hashing the blockchain into the blockchain itself is such an amazing concept that something cool must be able to be built around that concept.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:36:47
I suppose the protocol itself could talk to a factom api to hash its own state of itself into itself for nodes to reference to. Remember factom is a decentralised protocol also. Sounds trippy AF but if there is a way someone somewhere could build off of this idea I am happy..

Focus on your customer more than your product. Get fixed on your customer experience, and your product will keep changing to serve them best. But fix your product, and customers will find a path that fits them, with or without you.
We've moved from the industrial age where it was all about the product and productization to the technological age where its all about the customer and customization.

The internet is as decentralized as a technology gets (ICANN is the equivelant of the bitlicence).. and when it was first invented it was considered very anonymous.. so your argument is void, sir..
Bitcoin is neutral, so as more legitimate usecases start to appear the illegal use cases will become insignificant in the big picture exactly the same as the internet.. and as time goes on people will and are discovering that policing and tracking people on bitcoin is easier and cheaper than the current fragmented financial system..

So as long as the inital copy of the blockchain hashed into itself through factom is trusted and set up in an autonomous way as to keep an audit trail of the current state of the network, then that audit trail can always be considered a true state of the entire blockchain without having to audit or sync everything within the entire blockchain. Then nodes can start validating transactions on proofs that hold to the true state of the network without syncing.. thats my thinking..

Even if BU had 95% support it would still become an altcoin. The chain with the most devs behind it will be considered bitcoin, then having all supporting miners will allow segwit to activate, which will make bitcoin core the one coin with the most devs, future scaling promises like LN possible, and no more current blocksize issues, which will bring most of the BU supporters back to bitcoin core. All the while BU will be sitting there with less devs and no LN possible. It may have more hashing power mometarily but that will revert back to bitcoin core IMO

Good question I have been wondering the same thing.. magnr has been around for a while previously named btc.sx and they are very easy to set up, fund, trade and withdraw as they dont touch fiat.

Exactly, personal security of private keys and general computer hygiene is one thing (which will become more managable as innovation solves those problems). On the other hand If someone is able to break a public key to get a private key then they have figured out how to hack any financial transaction on the planet.. Anything more specific, like they would be able to mess with and break SWIFT of ACH, or any other non financial network we use daily??
I guess what u are saying is if someone figures out how to beak public key cryptography then they can effortlessly figure out any password for any website!

Bitcoin is a decentralised service, just because it is decentralised does not change the dynamics of providing a service. It still has a product (global ledger) and it still has customers.. regardless wether it is centralised or decentralised it is still competing for market share, and still has customers. When I transact on the network I am a paying customer of that service.

There will always be alternative platforms. Its will come down to a case of developer backing, speed and cost efficiency.
If ethereum maintains a larger group of devs, maintains faster processing than RSK, at a cheaper gas rate, then it will remain strong. But according to this article RSK will dominate those metrics. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
I like the analogy that ethereum is iOS and RSK is android. Something like that. People will use both as there will be demand for both and therefore devs will launch apps on both the same as app devs today launch on both iOS and android.

There are 3 levels of this tech.
Bankchains/R3 which will dessimate swift within the next 3 to 5 years
National permissioned blockchains which will let central banks turn their national currencies into tech with the same capabilities as btc but only on a country to country level (still a walled garden)
Then there are global public blockchains like bitcoin which are open and permissionless.. 
First banks will implement and wipe out swift.. then central banks will implement to improve their currencies.. then just like the internet people will say why use a national intranet when we can use a global internet.

So have it look at only the last (however many weeks or months) to determine the adjusted size.. Long enough to make spamming for that amount of time extremely expensive, and only a certain time frame (not all of blockchain history).. That way if LN gets adopted the blocksize can also shrink.
Also "unsustainable levels over a time" is not forever. Once the spamming stops the blocksize will reduce. Therefore if the only incentive of spamming is to centralise mining it is not viable because the attack would have to be ongoing forever.

So if thats the case and the decentralised factom protocol cant be trusted to keep an audit trail then their whole business model is void.. I guess my thinking is that the bitcoin protocol itself (as a side fuction) could talk to the factom protocol and relay its current state of the longest chain for the factom protocol to hash back into the blockchain, utimately allowing nodes to start up with a consensys view of the network without syncing any previous blockchain data.. like i said technically im probably way off and if its a technical impossibility then so be it.. but hashing the entire blockchain (not just the last PoW hash) into itself is such a cool concept.. thanks for your explanations above.. cheers

An ETF is an exchange traded fund. Meaning it is a fund that holds only bitcoin and you can trade their shares on an exchange.
Gold ETF is paper gold because there are more shares representing gold than actual gold held by that fund. Our hope is that the bitcoin ETF will be transparent in its holdings, meaning it proves that it holds 100% of the shares it issues in an equal amount of bitcoin. 
Also paper gold traders never want phyisical gold delivery (its time consuming and pointless) thats why it was easy to get away with issuing paper gold. But a bitcoin ETF will have consistantly higher demand for btc withdrawl from the fund so that will keep them in check.

Good points regarding the $150 premium that represents the 15% chance of an ETF approval already being priced in.
Also it is true that another centralised pool of btc inside an ETF is concentrating risk more than needed.
I want an ETF approval for my short term gains to be realised, but i also understand long term it is not the best thing for bitcoin at the moment.
However having said that, what happens if the ETF is denied, we experience a short $150 flash crash, and then the price continues to rally into new highs and another bubble anyway? Another bubble is inevitable regarless of the ETF, IMO.

Once volatility falls enough for people to comfortably price goods and services directly in bitcoin (maybe in 10 years from now), stability of bitcoin will be assumed, its at that point the prices of goods and services will change instead of the price of bitcoin.
Prices of goods and services will fluctuate just like today with fiat currency. Fiat currency is by no means stable, its traded against other currencies just like stocks, even the british pound just dropped 30% in a day after brexit, did that mean prices increased 30% in the UK in one day? No.
Once goods and services are priced in bitcoin people will stop seeing the price of bitcoin and start seeing the value of their goods and services.
The difference being, compared to inflationary fiat currencies that make prices rise slowly over the years, a deflationary bitcoin will make prices slowly fall in price over the years.
Bitcoin doesnt have to be exactly stable against fiat currency to be used as money to price goods and services. It just needs to be less volatile to the point where there is no massive changes month by month. The exact same as fiat currencies today. 
Once goods and services are priced in bitcoin stability will be inherant.

Yo peter, 
Can you offer gold money accounts to all 7 billion people on earth. Even if they have no form of ID?
Can you guarantee that your centralised company that is directly competing with the USD wont get shut down like all other centralised competitors to the USD in the past?
Can you guarantee that all the meta data of transaction information (due to your KYC AML regulations) wont get hacked, or given to government agencies when they ask for it?
Can you even cross borders and get merchants and customers onboarded outside of the US?
I could go on and on.
Seems to me his problem with bitcoin is it already accomplishes what he has been trying to achieve for a long time with goldmoney.
The old generation will hang onto the already forgotten past. The new generation will embrace the future in the form of decentralised internet based money and payments.

Sharp rises are always followed by a crash.
In the run up from $10 to $260 it became a bubble once there were censecutive $10 moves up in a day. 
In the run up from $100 to $1200 it became a bubble once there were consecutive $100 moves up in a day.
Similarly today i would call it bubble territory once there are consecutive $1000 moves up in a day.
I agree bitcoins usefulness is its value proposition. However the best way to get there currently in a safe manner is segwit, schnorr, sidechains, LN etc. A Hard Fork with a braisen blocksize increase is brash, risky and ultimately will damage the reputation of the network if and when there is a coin split and gives miners incentive to centralise even further.
We all want the same outcome. A usefull bitcoin, its just about how we get there. In a safe way, or a bull-in-a-china-shop way. Safe is always better IMO.

"Whats the incentive for on chain payments?" Wanting it recoded in a public and global manner on an immutable transparent ledger.
Many many use cases require on chain transactions. From large value transactions where both parties need a record, to non financial use cases like factom audit trails or land title registry etc etc etc.
There will be demand for cheap instant off chain txns and there will be just as much demand for on chain globally recorded and globally auditable txns.
LN is for us little guys and our coffee payments, On chain is for the big boys that require verifiability over time and globally transparent auditable record keeping.
If you dont need a receipt you use LN, if you do need a receipt you use on chain. Simple as that.

Have core stated they are doing this.. its a patch, if they agree to the compromise they could announce it.
And regardless if its an emergency or not why do nothing when u can do something.. media is all over this "backlogged transaction" concept so its not a technical emergency but it is a PR / reputation / confidence emergency.. also its not at all like they havent had time to compromise, this has been a straining issue for almost a year! Its like they wont take any action until absolutely forced, both sides should be working in unison on compromises not just one side..
To OPs post:

I agree however a constant back log is unpredictable resulting in fluctuations in fees.

Dynamic block size/flex caps is the only logical way forward IMO. If we need space urgently we get it short term until further scaling solutions are developed, if we dont need the space after scaling solutions are implemented the flex cap reduces allowing slight pressure to remain on fees. And this is achieved as one single hard fork that offers the best long term foundation for block size. Everyone wins! Big blockers get their big blocks while its absolutely needed, and small blockers get their small blocks once they implement scaling solutions, all while constantly keeping slight pressure on fees maintaining miners income. Why is this not in development? 
This is also the ONLY way to actomatically/algorithmically maintain the same overall constant pressure on fees over time, allowing fees to be fairly constant in price over time. Imagine being able to predict roughly how much your transaction fee would cost in 5 years from now regardless of what happens in the mean time.
This is also very necessary once the block reward is no longer enough alone to subsidise mining. The miners will be relying almost entirely on fees so they will also need some certainty regarding future fees to base their business on. This flex cap solution, while not guaranteeing fees, will atleast give a way to predict with relative accuracy the reward from fees per block over time.

Perfect stability is only possible if a currency supply grows in exact allignment with population growth and productivity. This is not a good solution however , first its almost impossible and second it requires centralised intervention.
A better solution is a currency that rewards productivity over time. Slowly falling prices over time are the reward we get for being more innovatine as a civilisation.. as innovation increases things get cheaper. Thats how it should be and thats what bitcoin provides

@_date: 2017-03-13 16:33:13
Similar to the ethereum fork. BTU will start from zero and move up while the main bitcoin chain will loose some its value..
My theory is the price would be similar to the ETF ruling where there will be a flash crash and then we will climb back up to where we started.
And just like ethereum the bitcoin main chain will end up ignoring the BTU chain and end up making new highs.
Hash power doesnt mean anything. 90%+ of bitcoin users are behind the main bitcoin core chain therefore the price will not be effected that much.
Plus all the bitcoin holders who end up with free BTU coins will just dump them for whatever they can get and turn them into real bitcoin, that will effectively crash the BTU price.
BTU will then be left for speculation purposes just like ethereum classic is now.

Mike Hearn rage quit, Roger Ver sold his btc for alts, btc price rose, he needs it to go down again to buy back his coins without taking a loss, so he turned his previously "anti-censorship" sub reddit into a BU subreddit to try and attack the network to get the price to drop.
This is very clear to me.. attackers like Ver arnt the problem (they will always exist in some form) its the ignorant immature misinformed group of bitcoiners blindly following him giving his idea traction thats the problem.
Solution: create more easily accessible easy to understand communication mediums to clear up misinformation about bitcoin and prevent ignorance being taken advantage of.

I cannot guess a dollar amount but one thing is for sure, sometime within the next 3 months we will have broken out into new highs and run up into another massive bubble and subsequent correction.
Who knows where the top will be and where the price will settle after the correction but it will be alot higher than we are today.

It does not effect at all how miners make their money. All it does is make the protocol less suseptible to a small group of people and redecentralises the evoloution of the network.
Yes miners will need to accept this change but most miners dont want to be involved in the politics of bitcoins evolution anyway so most miners will accept it.

Actually that is correct.. so UASF makes bitcoin very suseptible to malicious attacks then!
I guess the best solution would be to have a world of only decentralised P2Pools.. each running their own version of bitcoin and people vote by contributing their personal hashing power to the one pool that does what they want. For example a p2pool for segwit vs an old p2pool that follows bitcoins old rules. If the majority want segwit then the majority direct their hashing power to the p2pool that signals segwit.

Wallets will offer a simple choice.
1) pay a fee and wait atleast 10 minutes to have your transaction recorded on the blockchain forever. (Bitcoin core)
2) pay no fee and get an instant irreversible confirmation that is still as secure as bitcoin, just without a permanent public record of your individual transaction. (Lightning Network)
This will be possible WITHIN 12 months of segwit activation. Wallets are already testing LN integration into their software through testnet.

I never said increasing the blocksize was a good idea.

Is there a fee required to move these bitcoins to a LN channel? I think the answer is obviously yes in which case this is a huge problem and something overlooked by core devs. Even if segwit is implemeted LN wont be feasibly usable for some time at which point we will be back in the same high fee situation rendering alot of bitcoins unmovable.
Unless all these low value UTXOs are able to be combined with other UTXOs the owner controls into one larger fee paying transaction. Which may be the case (im not sure) in which case this post is unnecessary FUD.
If UTXOs can not be combined into one transaction this is a problem. If they can be combined then this is not a problem at all.

1) It wasnt a technical recession it was a per capita recession. A per capita recession is quite different. Australia had a per capita recession in 2006 and still avoided the GFC without a technical recession.
2) Australia didnt fall into this recession this week. This per capita recession started in Q3 2018 and continued into Q4 2018. The reason it wasnt acknowledged until now was because the Q4 2018 GDP numbers werent released until this week, making this week the first time you could see Aus had negative per capita growth for two consecutive quarters.
So Australia was in a 'per capita' recesson for the second half of 2018.

Set a fee that prevents dust, 1 cent or whatever.. 1 billion people using bitcoin daily is a good fee reward for the miners.. by the time the block reward is not enough to keep the miners incentivised we will have so many users that dust transaction fee will add up
Also do this: set the algorithm to a limit like 90%. Enough to allow all transactions while being close enough to the limit that a fee market still exists.. We are 90% full now and a fee market is there.. This would work!

"Sell the rumor buy the fact" is a twist on the old addage "buy the rumor sell the fact". Basically "buy the rumor sell the fact" means that people buy on anticipation of good news causing the price to rally, then when that good news is released the price instantly spikes high but is followed by a crash (even though the news was good). So you buy before the big run up before the news, and sell directly upon the good news to make the most money. This has been happening for many many decades. It is not a new idea.
If its reversed you get "sell the rumor buy the fact" which is what im pertaining to. Which would be something like seeing the last 1 week of people selling btc in anticipation of bad news, then once that bad news is released the price instantly spikes low. Smart traders buy on the announcement making the dip extremely short and causing a rally thereafter, meanwhile the average person is selling on the bad news and by then the price has already flash crashed and is rallying, so average people end up selling as the price is rising. The best way to make money in this scenario is to sell the rumor (anticipation of bad news) and then buy the fact (announcement of bad news). Because by the time you sell upon hearing the rejection announcement the instant flash crash will already be over and you will be selling into a rally.
Its just an opinion. But does go to show how the people planning to sell on an etf rejection announcement could loose out big time as they will unknowingly be selling into a rally and will have to buy back in at a much higher price.
Who knows what will ultimately happen.. but do not blindly think that selling after a rejection is a no brainer and will make you money. This kind of thinking is dangerous. If bitcoin has taught me anything about trading its that no trade is a sure thing. If you think selling after an etf rejection is a sure thing then chances are you are wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:01:19

I dont see bitcoin as an investment.
Its just that if you use two currencies it is human nature to hold onto the one that is more scarce and spend the one that is printed out of thin air.
Its not investing, its human nature based around the animalistic desire to obtain rare and scarce items over all else.
To people who have no idea what bitcoin is they are speculators / gamblers. But for those that understand bitcoins strict scarcity properties it is all about human nature as it relates to value selection.

Soon your wallet will show you 2 options.. pay a fee and wait 10 minutes to record your transaction forever on the blockchain. Or pay no fee and have your transaction confirmed instantly via lightning network.
In the future the transaction fee for recording your data forever in the blockcain will be decided by the people needing their data recorded. What is a transaction thats recorded forevr worth? What is immutability and trust worth to non monetary use cases? 
There will be no need for us regular people to pay a fee and record our transactions because we will have the option of instant free transaction over payment channels. Paying fees for recorded data will be used by people and companies and apps that require verifiable immutability.

I myself believe that a rejection will have a shorter and shallower downwards effect on the price than most people think.. simply because there is so much hype now around new all time highs, the gold price, and an expected rally into the thousands.
We might see a shallow flash crash and just keep on running higher.. or we might just shrug off a rejection and keep on running without a big pull back at all.
What is very unlikey is bitcoin falling below $1000 and staying there for a long period of time. The ETF just isnt that big of a deal IMO. Bitcoin will still be the same without it.
Also take into account we may very well be up at $1500 before the ETF announcement.

Americas percieved strength is derived from their staus as global reserve currency.

Does the gold ETF (GLD) buy ship and store / sell offload and ship gold bullion daily? 
No, their holdings of gold dont even represent their shares available.. there is something like 100x paper ounces of gold more than physical ounces of gold in that ETF to back it up.
My point is all the btc ETF needs is an account on a few exchanges like coinbase and they are set.. if it takes them 1 week to balance their books then that wont affect the operation of the ETF so wont affect the outcome of the decision.

I would have more than 50% of the nodes.. or even better what if i easily acuired 90% of all nodes..
Unless ofcourse nodes cannot activate a fork at all, but merely run whatever they choose. Which they could already do now, correct?
Or is it that nodes cannot hard fork, only miners can hard fork. But nodes can soft fork and if its a majority of nodes miners would be forced to follow the majority or risk loosing money. But that still brings me back to my point. What if i easily acuired 90% of all nodes. UASF a malicious soft fork, and convinced everyone that it is because of genuine user interest with a well funded marketing scheme.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:57:04
Bitcoin was originally supposed to be "one node = one vote". This was back when all users were also miners, before intensive asic mining and before light wallets. 
So UASF is just bringing bitcoin back to what was originally concieved of and planned all along.
There is no one "more important" in bitcoin. Users and miners alike are equally important and should therefore have the same voting powers. 
Voting power based on Hash power is a very centralised way forward. Voting power based on nodes is a very decentralised way forward.
Not everyone has hashing power, but everyone can run a node. This is the logical path for bitcoin to take into the future. Im actually surprised it hasnt happened earlier.
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:26:39

Mining will develop, u think the current pools and miners will be the only operators ever? Seriously? Have u ever heard of capitalism? If there is profit there are companies.. in 5-10 years there will be dozens and dozens of major mining farms in every single country with an internet connection, how is that centralised? So right now u have a handful of farms and u think there will be no more? Thats like 6 years ago saying there only a handful of home miners so there will be no more? Seriously?

So if we had 0.5mb blocks it would be more p2p and decentralized, but wouldnt that mean I would be waiting weeks for my transaction to confirm or paying 50 cents per transaction.. who would pay 50 cents to move a one dollar bill from their wallet to their dresser draw? The same as sending my own btc between wallets.. effectively rendering btc useless for me..
Shouldnt the blocksize increase with demand and then if demand falls because of other advances like lightning network shrink the blocksize back down?
I believe this would be a natural phenomenon should miners limit their own block sizes based on their capacity/fee market/risk of orphaned blocks.. users would put upwards pressure on the blocksize with fees, whilst miners would put downwards pressure on the blocksize with their race to propogate. Ending in a beautiful equalibrium.. if LN launched fees go down therefore block sizes go down.. 
I see what you are saying regarding anyone being a node and not having the storage space etc.. but if btc is successfull we wont have just a few miners.. capitalism still exists and if there is profit there is competition.. in the most part moores law will keep up with the individuals who want to host a node.. but there will be many many mining farms in every country on earth if btc is still around (and that is decentralised and censorship resistant enough for me

I would argue that selling btc and therefore distributing it among more hands is healthy for the ecosystem, in so far as to reduce the genie coefficient.
If no one sold the distribution of btc would be so out of whack.
There is nothing wrong with selling btc, it is healthy, remember for every buyer there is a seller. The only people who believe otherwise are people self interested in the price alone and getting rich quick by way of other people never selling therefore creating upwards price pressure.
True believers know that no amount of selling can hurt bitcoin long term.

1 year before a halving was always the best time to buy, and 1 year after a halving was always much much higher.

I highly doubt we will stay below 900 for a long period of time ever again, hence why calling for people to sell at 900 was ignorant IMO

Thats because it did!.. first it was free, then the fees were insignificant so people marketed that as a feature because it was! Now fees are so high that its prohibitive for low salary workers in poor countries to use at all. It is working like this now to supposedly protect the size of the blockchain from growing, as if thats a problem long term.. It is not..
Rising the blocksize slowly to prevent high fees is beneficial. Having a block size limit in place to prevent sustained attacks on the network is also beneficial, having other solutions to reduce transaction size etc is beneficial.
Answer: create segwit / thin blocks / LN etc to help more transactions fit in 1 block. At the same time implement a solutuion that says the blocksize limit is always 20% higher than the average block size over the last 1000 blocks, this will prevent sustained ddos style attacks and allow low fees on the network.
If there are more solutions that reduce the amount of space used in the blockchain then the blocksize wont grow, so there will be incentive for scaling solutions to continuously be implemented still.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:29:20
Long term yes thousands of transactions per second will be required for 21, but in the direct future not so much, question is, before LN is implemented (a long time from now) would they default to choosing ethereum given it is currently better suited? he seems to be very pro 17s block times and other features of ethereum. Bitcoin seems to be creating barriers to entry, by creating artificially high fees that will turn startups away from btc for their initial proof of concepts. while other blockchain options are creating more optimal environments for early start ups to deploy their early beta code (in the short term anyway).
The "current" bitcoin is in my mind no doubt forcing startups (that would have used bitcoin) onto other blockchain platforms drectly because of these pointlessly high fees. There are many startups factom, storj and even 21 etc etc who are already implementing ethereum as a safety valve directly because these high fees affect their early beta code or proof of concepts.
Its all about adoption. This current bitcoin fee model that is unnecessary is sacrificing user adoption and start up adoption so people who wouldnt think about running a node can now say "look the cost of running a node isnt increasing, but i still have no interest in running a node".
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:33:25
So the answer is to destory years of marketing of "free and easy to use" and prevent adoption of 60-70% of the world to try and get higher fees to increase security to grow adoption? Prevent adoption to grow adoption?? Really?
I would argue that higher fees would not increase security by a significant amount. The only thing that will increase security significantly is a higher price which comes from higher adoption (60% of the underbanked wanting to hold btc).
You may have the horse before the cart. (Trying to achieve a means to an end, you are focusing on the means and neglecting the end, the real goal).

Yep onboarding still has its pain points, mainly because of exchanges and their imposed regulations.
The easiest way is to buy through LocalBitcoins. set up a buy order, send the cash through Western Union, recieve bitcoins, then send those bitcoins to your own wallet (I use Mycelium for android and bread wallet for iOS). Back-up your wallet, or go one step further and send those coins to a cold storage paper wallet. Or even better is to hold them on a hardware wallet like Trezor.

Even better is he could sell this car now after enjoying it for 18 months and buy back into btc at the bottom and still come out way ahead having more btc than he had before he bought the car.

Since the begining of bitcoin people have been saying that the most corrupt countires would ban it and the countries with the most freedom and liberty would allow it.
India is corrupt as fuck. Egypt is corrupt as fuck. 
Bitcoin is just shining a light on the level of corruption.
Also corruption causes poverty so no wonder then that the poorest countries are the ones that are most corrupt and banning it. 
The good news is that in corrupt countries the rule of law is weak and people dont abide by the rules themselves, so they will find ways of using bitcoin regardless of whether it is outlawed or not.

Yes but the value is increasing at the same time the halvening amount is decreasing.
Price is $x, supply introduction halves, price increases to $x. 
Because the halving forces the price to increase the dollar value of the reward every 10 minutes remains the same.
So, say before the halving the dollar value released every ten minutes is $250 ($5 bitcoin price, 50 btc reward = $250 every 10 minutes). Then one month later the price increases to $260 then falls then rises to $1200 then falls and settles and has an average of $250 over that entire time, but the reward is now 25 btc every 10 minutes so the reward in terms of dollars is $6250 every 10 minutes. Each halving will actually increase the value of the block reward even though the btc per block is decreasing.
Set value - 50% supply will always affect the price positively. The fact its exponentially reducing is absolutely irrellevant, as it is always 50%. 50% is 50% regardless.
The simple fact that the halving itself increases the price makes your point irrelevant.
Each reduction is 50% of a higher dollar value! Making the percentage amount of the reduction in terms of total btc available irrelevant.
If each halving was taking place at the same dollar value say $250 then you would have a point. But the price in dollars is increasing at the same time the btc reward is decreasing so the effect is neutral.

Thing that I took away from his article that made me think the most is this:
Because the "big" buying takes place on the otc markets (where buying doesnt affect the price) that means a majority of the selling takes place on exchanges (where the price is set) atificially pushing the price down. Meaning once we have large regulated exchanges where big players can securely buy and hold in a way that also reflects the price, then that will push the price up substantially to a price point that will reflect these big buyers! Very bullish

Will check them out. I just liked the idea of having a home banking device for the family, one code for the head of household, one for wifey, one for the kids to recieve their allowance (kind of like an automated in home atm).
Plus the security of the device being locked in a safe or such, or attached securely to a wall.
Also with access to the phone holding the bither app a hacker can still delve into the phone and find the private keys as the keys have to be held on the device after all.
This stand alone home banking device would be dedicated entirely to this one app. Meaning any brute force attempt at the master (head of household) passcode would wipe the device of all data entirely. The kids allowance retrieval passcode could obviously be unlimited and very simple :)

The difference here is that he is selling into the exchanges where price is set, and then buying into the otc market where big buying doesnt affect the price. Then when the panic selling stops the rising price on the exchanges also reflects in a higher price on the otc market.. Its a way of manipulating the price to profit while eliminating slippage.

Scarcity alone means absolutely nothing. My ear wax is scarce and one of a kind yet is completely valueless.. 
What matters is the combination of scarcity AND utility. 
Bitcoin is useful. It is a bank account without a bank. It is an inflation hedge. It is an investment alternative. It is a new technology with immutable truth. It is the worlds only trustless ledger of account. It is a global payment protocol. 
Add all of this utility with the fact it is scarce and you have tremendous value!

Alright but the mycelium &gt; coinapult feature for normal people doesnt work like that. I have to wait for a transaction to confirm on the blockchain for the transfer to take place.. Full blocks destroy that hedging feature for regular people.
So small blocks protect traders (who use centralised services) but hurt average people who want to hedge on their own private wallet. Effectively pushing people off of user controlled wallets and onto centralised exchanges! How is that beneficial to the ecosystem? All I have heard in the past is dont use centralised exchanges but now full blocks are pushing the users onto centralised services...

@_date: 2017-01-08 04:04:53
Alright so peter schiff is extremely easy to do a rebuttal to when he talks about bitcoin because all his negative arguments are also relevant to gold.
But here goes
Point 1: bitcoin is a cult.
Rebuttal: gold is also cultish, and people also believe gold will make them rich. Bitcoin is not cultish it has a small healthy group of people who believe in its future long term, along with some day traders.
Point 2: chinese buying pushed the price up and the yuan rising caused the crash.
Rebuttal: bitcoin was overdue for a rally, and after it went up it was overdue for a big correction, you can say any event caused the action in hindsight but the truth is this market is just trying to find its true value and that involves big price moves due to the fact it is such a young and misunderstood technology.
Point 3: he said he was right because the price dropped 25% after he told people to sell on his podcast last wednesday, even though the price has recovered from $812 back to around $900. He is saying to still sell at this price.
Rebuttal: he cannot predict the future just like anyone else cannot predict the future, but if you look at past bitcoin rallies its easy to see the pattern of a massive rally then a crash at the previous highs then a recovery and another massive rally into new highs again. This has happened 5 or so times in bitcoins short history and is inevitable to get bitcoin to a point where it is stable enough to use as a currency. If the price rises above previous all time highs he will be eating his words once again!
Point 4: bitcoin is too volatile to be used in commerce.
Rebuttal: this is currently true, but volatility is the only way to get it to a valuation large enough that it gains stability, i.e. When a $100 move in price represents a 0.01% change instead of a 10% change. This is expected and inevitable, bitcoin is not ready to be a currency but once it has a large enough valuation that causes volatility to be a non issue it will be considered a safe store of value and will then be ready to be used as currency. This is still 5 years away IMO. FYI gold is also volatile!
Point 5: gold money is better than bitcoin because "goldmoney has something that bitcoin doesn't, you have a debit card". 
Rebuttal: many many bitcoin exchanges use the same debit card as gold money allowing you to spend bitcoin anywhere visa and mastercard are accepted! I have a friend who lives off of his bitcoin debit card.
Point 6: gold money is not decentralised and has counterparty risk, but it has insurance through brinks. He argues bitcoin also has counterparty risk "look at mt gox". He also states that if you keep your btc on a mobile wallet you can get hacked and if its on a paper wallet you cant do anything with it.
Rebuttal: yes this is a new and evolving technological field of innovation. We are new and already have extremely safe mobile wallets, hardware wallets and bitcoin exchanges that also offer insurance. Bitcoin has more options for protection and security than just gold money and one insurer!
Point 7: when he recommends gold he usually says keep 10% in goldmoney and 90% in physical gold. So you have less counterparty risk. 
Rebuttal: the same can be done with bitcoin, you keep 10% with an exchange or online wallet for commerce, and 90% in cold storage. Or even better you can keep 100% on a hardware wallet for maximum convenience and safety with zero counterparty risk.
Point 8: bitcoin is online so its traceable, so there is no privacy.
Rebuttal: goldmoney knows every customer and records every single transaction for compliance reasons, where is the privacy there?, also goldmoney servers can be hacked and that information leaked! This right here is a big deal and the biggest problem with centralised financial record keeping. Goldmoney is the hackable honeypot that will leak all of their customers financial metadata! Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be, also lightning network will add privacy by default! 
Point 9: "there is more risk that governments crack down on bitcoin than they do on goldmoney".
Rebuttal: lets look at history. Every single centralised system that competed with the USD like e-gold etc etc was shut down! Every single decentralised protocol like bittorrent was unable to be shut down, this is why decentralisation is the ONLY way to compete with the USD.
Point 10: there is more illegal activity going on in bitcoin, while goldmoney has no privacy at all so they know there is absolutely no illegal activity going on.
Rebuttal: do we ban cars because criminals use them? Do we ban cellphones because criminals use them? Do we ban the internet because criminals use it? Technology is neutral, it represents the population using it, once mainstream adoption is reached it will represent people using it to take place in legal commerce. It also depends on your preference of privacy, if you dont care about privacy then goldmoney may be better for you. There is a great quote to remember by famous french writer Victor Hugo. " All the forces in the world are not so powerful ad an idea whose time has come".
Point 11: banks wont touch bitcoin as hey are not allowed to because of compliance issues.
Rebuttal: yea, thats kind of the whole point. And that is a great thing meaning banks cant innovate with digital currency while the rest of the world moves ahead.
Point 12: bitcoin can crash to zero. Dont invest because it may go to zero. "Why take the chance".
Rebuttal: yes, its very experimental, but that is where the opportunity lies! By the time bitcoin is considered a "safe" investment all the gains will have already been made! Its all about risk vs reward. With bitcoin you can risk a small amount of money for a potentially large return. If you dont like that risk profile then buy gold.
Point 13: he regrets not buying bitcoin at $10 when he first heard about it. Most people who bought back then have bailed out and are trying to sell into this bubble.
Rebuttal: how could he possibly prove this statement? If he regrets not buying at $10 then will he MAY also regret not buying at $1000.
He is appealing to the old school dinosaur gold bugs who dont know anyhing about bitcoin. He makes ignorant comments that his followers take as truth and that feeds into their bias against bitcoin because it competes with gold! 
It is very easy for someone who is knowledgeable about bitcoin to rebut his arguments simply because most of the arguments he makes against bitcoin are also true of gold which really makes me laugh.
Peter is a smart guy but he just doesnt understand bitcoin nor does he have any incentive to educate himself on the technology. He is not a tech start-up venture capitalist he is a stock trader! So why would you listen to his opinion on a tech start-up? Listen to the VCs and you will get much better information regarding bitcoin there.

Why would I pay 10 cents every time I took money from my bed side table and moved it to my wallet.. or when my wife gives me change to buy groceries.. or when I give my kid his allowance.. etc etc..
All the original use cases (bitcoin replacing cash) are dead if fees are high.. in that scenario it is only replacing traditional banking.. so high fees equal digital banking, not digital cash.
Even with Gold I can take a 1 ounce coin and give it to the person standing next to me without paying a fee.. so gold is better than bitcoin in that sense.
At the end of the day, if there are fees that are noticable in size then cash is better to use than bitcoin.
Bitcoin only makes sense if fees are small or unnoticable. Otherwise btc is only targeting overseas long distance money transfers, Not the other 5 billion people on earth using cash to trade.
What person in africa or the philippines or india will use btc if every time they move money from their cold wallet to their hot wallet it costs them a large amount. 10cents is 4.6 philippine pesos, low salary is 1500 pesos per week (thats not the "poor", just low salary workers). So just THREE transactions can cost 1% of your weekly salary! That is ALREADY UNACCEPTABLE and the fee market is just getting started. Imagine you wanted to perform just 20 transactions per week, thats 6-7% of your weekly salary! So bitcoin is ALREADY far worse than traditional banking already offered in the philippines! 
A fee market absolutely destorys the ability for the 5 billion underbanked poor living in undeveloped countries to use bitcoin.
The price of btc will always be high enough to subsidize miners even when there is a reward of less than 1 btc every 10 minutes.. and if you dont believe that, then you dont beleieve in bitcoins success in the first place.
Fees should only be a measure in place to prevent extremely large amounts of small transactions from one person as a malicious ddos style attack against btc. And in that case fees should be unnoticable to people.. only noticable if you are trying to attack the network.
This fee market we have today is a fallacy and extremely detrimental to the adoption of bitcoin in the rest of the world outside the US and Europe etc.

@_date: 2016-06-25 16:11:46


Yes true, and it is a problem if the dollar price is constant.. but its not as the supply reduction increases the dollar value.
If one bitcoin is worth 1 million dollars and the reward is .005 btc per block then the reward is still $5000 per block, similar to todays reward.. and your holdings of .01 btc are worth $10,000 .. in that scenario a 50% decrease in supply from .005 btc to .0025 btc per block would still be as big of a deal as it is for this upcoming halving. And will just as much have a large positive affect on the price. 50% is 50% regardless of the total supply.
Obviously Im not good at explaining this concept to you. But this is economic truth.
Just because you dont believe .005 btc will be worth as much as 25 btc is worth today doesnt mean it wont happen.. in fact i believe the supply reduction will.directly cause this to happen as long as demand is constant or increasing. Basic supply and demand.
The only thing that can slow down demand (in a success scenario) would be when every person already owns bitcoin, gets paid in bitcoin, etc. In that case demand would be constant, as everybody already performs all of societies financial functions in btc, at that point demand would come from population growth. But regardless 50% reduction in supply would still be a big deal in 100 years.
Put it this way, imagine if btc issuance started 20 years ago at 200 btc per block, your argument states that this upcoming halving wouldnt have the same impact because there is more currency in circulation and the reduction is less in terms of total supply.. Regardless it is still a 50% reduction in new issuance! Your argument completely disregards the increase in price derived from the halving itself.
You say maths is all its about, but if maths explained everything there is to know about economics then there would be no such field as economics, your argument is extremely simple, there is way more to it than you state.
I think you may be confusing CPI inflation of traditional fiat currencies with constant supply reduction. If janet yellen said tomorrow that the rate of newly issued currency would halve, the result of this would be a stronger dollar and therefore goods denominated in usd would look cheaper. If she did this every 4 years the currency would strengthen every 4 years and demand in the form of population growth would see cheaper prices of good and services over time. If she stopped creating new dollars all together then the price of goods and services would fall as the population of the US increased.
One more example, gold has been around for millenia, mined as a commodity and currency alike over the last 5000 years. 99%+ of this metal has been unearthed already and the amount being mined per year compared to total available supply is tiny! So your saying if gold annual supply from mining all of a sudden halved tomorrow it would have no impact on the price?? I rest my case.

Visa is an old slow expensive payment network. Bitcoin is a new fast cheap payment network.
How on earth do you put visa between bitcoin transactions.

You need an 8gb graphics card to run the memory efficiently (or something like that) so average gpus are not profitable for much longer.
PoS will hopefully be implemented one day, no idea how that will happen or what the details are, its still quite an enigma.
One big difference from btc to eth, is that in btc the miners only have the power to roll back the entire chain of transactions, which will affect the entire community hence why it wouldnt happen.
In ethereum miners have the power to accept a soft fork that only changes the state of a single application. So you can see how ethereum is not really neutral to its applications, this could bring big neutrality and trust issues going forward.

Time value of money. Why save and never spend. Go to the grave a millionaire having lived like a peasant? Your thought process is exactly whats wrong with the current system. Why should i buy a new phone today if i can get a better one cheaper next year? Thats ridiculous. The 2% cheaper that phone will be next year is not worth waiting a year for it. If your theory was correct no one would ever buy electronics. 
An economy is built on savings and investment. An economy that discourages savings is screwed. Thats why bitcoin was invented, out of this exact necessity! 
The purpose of intentional inflation is to siphon money from the middle class to the government. You think its a good thing that over the last 50 years our society has gone from 1 paycheck (husband) to 2 paychecks (husband and wife) to a 30 year mortgage instead of an average home being saved for in 10 years and paid in cash, to credit card debt just to be able to buy groceries. That is not a healthy economy. If thats the price for making people spend more then forget it. 
So, lets deprive the people of the ability to save anything substantial, what a great way to encourage people to start a small business and then employ other people. Wow.
People living paycheck to paycheck notice nothing. Thats 80% of the global population right there. One day they get paid in fiat the next in btc. Realestate remains valuable. People who loose are those with exessive savings in fiat and fiat denominated debt instruments. Hopefully the retired have 401ks exposed to crypto just incase.
But this is all quite extreme, nothing says we dont spend the next 40 years slowly transitioning with hardly any effect noticed at all.

It remains prohibitavely expensive.. why on earth is abra taking such high fees from the very begining.. i understand the tellers set their own fees for the service they provide based on demand in the area and number of available tellers in the area.. but why on earth is abra already trying to monetize this app.in such a blatant way before there is even any real traction??

Just checked out bither and their cold wallet / hot wallet interoperability.. going forward if you guys at mycelium eventually implemented something like this it would be epic.. especially with your goal of becoming a complete financial suite style app.. I feel like owning a trezor as much as i feel like carrying my private keys around on a flash drive. For engineers and devs its a practical tool but for me its not, i would much prefer the user experience of my cold device having a user interface (even if its the size of an ipod nano, which would actually be pretty cool). But yea maybe feasible in 10 years from now.. Imagine being able to have one tablet in the home for everything financial completely cold and secure with one single seed backup. I dont see each individual having their own cold and hot wallet in the future, I see one main home banking device that connects to all family members in a secure way.
Anyway even just creating a bither like cold wallet app would be pretty cool. All your assets and tokens controlled from one secure offline seed on a dedicated app that signs transactions.. epicness

ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL!! except in fast motion this time.. instead of taking 3 months to reach this point it has taken 6 days!
If this pattern continues then in 6 days from now we will be retesting the $1150 mark..
Its funny how the crash after we reached $800 no one cared but this crash from $1150 is identical percentage wise and pattern wise, yet everyone looses their minds..

But they claim to be open source and permissionless.. what im having trouble understanding is how can a platform for transferring value not contain value?
Are they trying to be a platform for only vetted banks and large corporations to build on, or can any dev build on top of their blockchain?
Are they claiming to be open and permissionless when they arnt..
If any dev could could build on their platform it would be permissionless, but they have a list of members and they require membership.
If anyone could trade their token of value it would be open, but as far as I can see their blockchain doesnt hold any sort of value.
So to me it looks like they are closed and permissioned (in which case I understand they are nothing more than an "intranet") but then why are they marketing themselves as open and permissionless? Bending definitions quite a bit there I think. Not at all what I expected from the linux foundation!

It took facebook and twitter 3 years to reach 10 million users, then another 1 year after that to reach 100 million.
If it has taken bitcoin 8 years to reach 10 million users we could speculate that it may then only take another 2.5 to 3 years to reach 100 million users.
100 million users is the mainstream tipping point for adoption for most all technologies (given our global population of 7.5 billion). After facebook reached 100 million users adoption went vertical!
So take this into account and then realise most all of the financial gains of any asset are made before the mainstream jumps in, and it is plausible to speculate that bitcoin will experience the rest of its massive gains all within the next 3 years!

Permissioned blockchains are just databases with hash pointers.. this provides tamper evidence but NOT an unalterable database.. the only way to achieve an unalterable blockchain is with the use of proof or work.. its the cost of electricity and the decentralised nodes that makes bitcoin unalterable.. a permissioned private blockchain is very alterable!

Again he fails to comprehend the value of the protocol.
He looks at bitcoin and sees nothing but a digital currency. But that itself is not what gives bitcoins their value. Their value is derived from the utility of the protocol. The worlds first global platform for decentralised trust. THAT HAS VALUE. Period.
He needs to look into other use cases of a public blockchain like decentralised audit trails (aka factom) or the hundreds of other novel use cases that were not possible before.
In 1995 people who didnt understand the internet thought all the internet was, was email. Today people who dont understand bitcoin and the public blockchain protocol architecture think all it is, is digital currency. Its not. Currency is just the first app.
His 2 main arguments are a joke. 
"People dont accept 0.1 btc for a product. They use a visa debit card where the merchant recieves dollars." 
The exact same is true of gold and his gold money company. It just happens that his opinion is that in the future people would rather accept a digital representation of gold instead of a digital asset that requires no trust in his company. Millenials do not think like this. He is a dinosaur.
"The tech bubble crashed in 2000. Therefore bitcoin will crash and ruin its branding, therefore no one will use it anymore."  
Bitcoin has already crashed by 80% atleast 5 times in its short history. Yet adoption is growing. Go figure.
The tech bubble crashing did not change the fact that the internet was the future. The same with bitcoin. Crashes along the way will not change the fact that global permissionless public blockchains are the future. 
Choosing his gold money company is a vote for the status quo same old centralised trust in a third party architecture. Choosing bitcoin is a vote for a future world where trust is no longer required. Trust is a given. Trust is defined by math not by hope. That is the future. 
Are you on the right side of history or not? Because being on the right side of history pays, the wrong side does not.
Listening to peter talk it is blatantly obvious that he cannot differentiate between the currency and the underlying public blockchain protocol, the same as internet naysayers couldnt differentiate between email and the underlying public packet switching protocol.

I prefer to think that it will be a seemless transition the same as from gold to paper fiat. Except instead of going from good money to bad we go from bad money to good.
The masses will notice a banking and fiat collapse and will opt to get paid in btc instead of fiat. Savings lost perhaps but all debt now forgiven and forgotten. Clean slate. They continue earning and continue living. No win no loss. Except now with a strengthening currency instead of a devaluing currency their savings grow 2% per year instead of fall 2% per year. The increase in value a deflationary currency brings drives a constant growth in the economy due to an evenly felt wealth effect.
Society advances to a point where first the wife no longer has to work if she so chooses, then the husband scales back from 5 days a week, to 4 days a week, 4 hours per day as innovation and automation take over. All the while our currency that is now growing in value allows robots to take our jobs while we work less yet maintain the same standard of living. The value of money strengthens while the price of cost of living falls due to advancements in technology. Finally we reach a level of prosperity as a human society that allows amazing technology amazingly cheap all while being able to afford it by working one day on, two days off, in perpetuity. 
Historians will look back on the year 2017 and say why the fuck did 7 billion people collectively put up with a system of currency that increased the cost of living over time while innovation and efficiency gains should have been reducing the cost of living.

The point of "multi" seed is to make that one seed mutiple seeds.. you used to need 1 private key to spend but now you can have 2 of 3 priv keys.. 
You need one seed today but the idea is to require 2 of 3 seeds to spend or retrieve a HD wallet.
Seed 1: 12 words (high entropy) on device
Seed 2: password (low entropy) akin to 2FA
Seed 3: 12 words (high entropy) secure offline back-up
In this scenario if your phone or wallet is hacked the funds are safe. And any 2 of 3 combination of seeds is still high entropy. 
Mycelium for example if hacked can give away the one seed required to rebuild the HD wallet and then the attacker can spend that btc. But in this multi seed scenario even if the attacker acquires the on device seed they still cannot rebuild that HD wallet and spend funds.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:59:22
Alright so peter schiff is extremely easy to do a rebuttal to when he talks about bitcoin because all his negative arguments are also relevant to gold.
But here goes
Point 1: bitcoin is a cult.
Rebuttal: gold is also cultish, and people also believe gold will make them rich. Bitcoin is not cultish it has a small healthy group of people who believe in its future long term, along with some day traders.
Point 2: chinese buying pushed the price up and the yuan rising caused the crash.
Rebuttal: bitcoin was overdue for a rally, and after it went up it was overdue for a big correction, you can say any event caused the action in hindsight but the truth is this market is just trying to find its true value and that involves big price moves due to the fact it is such a young and misunderstood technology.
Point 3: he said he was right because the price dropped 25% after he told people to sell on his podcast last wednesday, even though the price has recovered from $812 back to around $900. He is saying to still sell at this price.
Rebuttal: he cannot predict the future just like anyone else cannot predict the future, but if you look at past bitcoin rallies its easy to see the pattern of a massive rally then a crash at the previous highs then a recovery and another massive rally into new highs again. This has happened 5 or so times in bitcoins short history and is inevitable to get bitcoin to a point where it is stable enough to use as a currency. If the price rises above previous all time highs he will be eating his words once again!
Point 4: bitcoin is too volatile to be used in commerce.
Rebuttal: this is currently true, but volatility is the only way to get it to a valuation large enough that it gains stability, i.e. When a $100 move in price represents a 0.01% change instead of a 10% change. This is expected and inevitable, bitcoin is not ready to be a currency yet but once it has a large enough valuation volatility will be a non-issue, then it will be considered a safe store of value and will be ready to be used as currency. This is still 5 years away IMO. FYI gold is also volatile! Also volatility is a short term benefit to bitcoin drawing in new users, and yes we do have locked USD accouts for example on the mycellium wallet you can take a portion and lock it to a set USD value and back again whenever you like by using a third party. This completely removes the volatility issue if you cant handle it.
Point 5: gold money is better than bitcoin because "goldmoney has something that bitcoin doesn't, you have a debit card". 
Rebuttal: many many bitcoin exchanges use the same debit card as gold money allowing you to spend bitcoin anywhere visa and mastercard are accepted! I have a friend who lives off of his bitcoin debit card.
Point 6: goldmoney is not decentralised and has counterparty risk, BUT it has insurance through brinks. He argues bitcoin also has counterparty risk "look at mt gox". He also states that if you keep your btc on a mobile wallet you can get hacked and if its on a paper wallet you cant do anything with it.
Rebuttal: yes this is a new and evolving technological field of innovation. We are new and already have extremely safe mobile wallets, hardware wallets and bitcoin exchanges that also offer insurance. Bitcoin has more options for protection and security than just gold money and one insurer!
Point 7: when he recommends gold he usually says keep 10% in goldmoney and 90% in physical gold. So you have less counterparty risk. 
Rebuttal: the same can be done with bitcoin, you keep 10% with an exchange or online wallet for commerce, and 90% in cold storage. Or even better you can keep 100% on a hardware wallet for maximum convenience and safety with zero counterparty risk.
Point 8: bitcoin is online so its traceable, so there is no privacy.
Rebuttal: goldmoney knows every customer and records every single transaction for compliance reasons, where is the privacy there?, also goldmoney servers can be hacked and that information leaked! This right here is a big deal and the biggest problem with centralised financial record keeping. Goldmoney is the hackable honeypot that will leak all of their customers financial metadata! Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be, also lightning network will add privacy by default! 
Point 9: "there is more risk that governments crack down on bitcoin than they do on goldmoney".
Rebuttal: lets look at history. Every single centralised system that competed with the USD like e-gold etc etc was shut down! Every single decentralised protocol like bittorrent was unable to be shut down, this is why decentralisation is the ONLY way to compete with the USD.
Point 10: there is more illegal activity going on in bitcoin, while goldmoney has no privacy at all so they know there is absolutely no illegal activity going on.
Rebuttal: do we ban cars because criminals use them? Do we ban cellphones because criminals use them? Do we ban the internet because criminals use it? Technology is neutral, it represents the population using it, once mainstream adoption is reached it will represent people using it to take place in legal commerce. It also depends on your preference of privacy, if you dont care about privacy then goldmoney may be better for you. There is a great quote to remember by famous french writer Victor Hugo. " All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come".
Point 11: banks wont touch bitcoin as they are not allowed to because of compliance issues.
Rebuttal: yea, thats kind of the whole point. Bitcoin is an alternative to banks, we do not need their participation. Also that is a great thing meaning banks cant innovate with digital currency while the rest of the world moves ahead.
Point 12: bitcoin can crash to zero. Dont invest because it may go to zero. "Why take the chance".
Rebuttal: yes, its very experimental, but that is where the opportunity lies! By the time bitcoin is considered a "safe" investment all the gains will have already been made! Its all about risk vs reward. With bitcoin you can risk a small amount of money for a potentially large return. If you dont like that risk profile then buy gold.
Point 13: he regrets not buying bitcoin at $10 when he first heard about it. Most people who bought back then have bailed out and are trying to sell into this bubble.
Rebuttal: how could he possibly prove this statement? If he regrets not buying at $10 then he MAY also regret not buying at $1000.
He is appealing to the old school dinosaur gold bugs who dont know anyhing about bitcoin. He makes ignorant comments that his followers take as truth and that feeds into their bias against bitcoin because it competes with gold! 
Peter is a smart guy but he just doesnt understand bitcoin nor does he have any incentive to educate himself on the technology. He is not a tech start-up venture capitalist he is a stock trader! So why would you listen to his opinion on a tech start-up? Listen to the VCs and you will get much better information regarding bitcoin there.

1) the protocol rules define the blocksize not the miners, just as it is today. A moving blocksize does not change this.
2) so your saying the halving wont impact the price. Your opinion. It is my opinion and basic supply demand economics that a 50% reduction in new supply at any time will always affect the price positively. We have just seen the price double in anticipation of the next halving.
3) fees will always be there they will just be so small they are unnoticable. When 20% of the population is using btc there will be more transactions and therefore more fees. When 50% is using it there will be more transaction and more fees.
I am saying the fees can always be small because by the time the fees are relied upon as miners income (in 100 years) there will be massive amounts of transactions and therefore a massive amout of fees to collect. There will be no fee introduction wall.. fees will just always be small but there will be more fees because of more users and more transactions in the future.. its about the number of fees paid not amount of individual fees.. 1 fee of 20 cents is the same as 20 fees of 1 cent each.
Your argument is that the number of transactions and users wont increase therefore current users should pay higher fees. I am saying the number of users and transactions will increase therefore the fee size can always be small while still providing more fees to the miners as time goes by.

Mainstream media has been bullish for a few months max. 2016 was still the narrative of bitcoin is nothing but blockchain is the future. Its only been this year and really only the last few months that bitcoin has taken the spotlight as "real" in the eyes of the mainstream media since its inception.
Wait until all this positivety flows through to the average investor who finally finishes reading up on how to buy and store bitcoin and gets a hardware wallet.

In developing rual countries and regions this may work with individual tellers.. but to really get the ball rolling with this in the rest of the world you need to heavily market the teller side to convenience stores, gas stations, 7/11s, starbucks etc so those stores do the teller transactions at the counter! 
This would turn every 7/11 into a cheaper western union! Now that would be huge!

100 million users is the break-out / mainstream tipping point.. we have around 10 to 20 million wallets created and probably only 5 million real users.
So basically we need to see a 20x increase in user adoption before we even begin to hit any form of mainstream tipping point.
If we follow fbs trajectory that will take place in 3 years from now.. but bitcoin ultimately is not yet as useful as fb was back in 2005 (in terms of a currency). So it will probably take a bit longer? Maybe 5 years before a significant mainstream adoption tipping point takes place.

The moving limit would be protocol defined. Not chosen by the miners.


Well obviously by the time the reward is less than 1 btc the value of bitcoin will be much much higher! Thats my point.
The reduction in supply (halving) actually causes the price to rise which maintains the incentive and level of security.. the price is driven by supply and demand. Supply reduction inturn increases the price which maintains a level of reward value that maintains the same level of security as before the halving. Basic supply demand. Econ 101.
Thats why its my view that the block reward will always be enough to maintain the same level of security we have today as a minimum, if not more in the future.

He (griff green) is not a dev, he is there communications guy. He has done a "masters in digital currency" course, whatever that actually teaches, but he is not a developer just their publicity guy. I do agree however that he seems to be brushing off the hack as a joke and not taking it too seriously at all, not very trust inspiring.
The idea is to soft fork first which will freeze all daos tokens not just the dao. Which has already screwed with trust on the ethereum network. And they then plan to hard fork to change the code in the dao, leaving us with the impression that miners or future stakers could potentially collude to change major apps on ethereum in the future without consent. Again ethereums immutable nature is screwed.
Or they remove the soft fork and let the hack take place, which then leaves one person in control of over 5% of all eth. When you take into consideration ethereum wants to shift from PoW to PoS and around 10% of eth is expected to be staking at any one time, well you can obviously see the problem there.. so do they destroy their immutable trust or destroy their PoS and scaling dreams? Either way its a messy situation.

This golden cross should take place either by the next new weekly candle or the one after. So likely before the end of november essentially.
In 2016 the 50week/100week golden cross signaled the official beginning of the bull market and triggered a price rise from $400 up to almost $800. Thats the equivelant of running from $8500 up to $17,000 now.

ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL!! except in fast motion this time.. instead of taking 3 months to reach this point it has taken 6 days!
If this pattern continues then in 6 days from now we will be retesting the $1150 mark..

Monetry policies are defined by the goal of stable prices and economic growth. Both of which a low supply growth rate money fosters better than a fast supply growth rate money.
Fiscal policy however is separate from monetary policy and can be different on a country by country basis even with sound money.
The truth is interest rate manipulation and inflation are the main causes of the business cycle, not the solution. America is running smack into this realisation right now infact.
If you disagree with sound money as a concept, as many keynesians do, then that has no value but its certainly not useless.

If you seriously think bitcoin should have higher fees than credit cards you are delusional.

My view is that when you travel and you have a bank account, and that bank account holds a large amount of money, you are not required to report the money as you are not physically travelling with it (even though a visa card allows you to spend it anywhere on earth).

The high of $1200 was 2013 not 2011 just FYI.
In terms of predictions here are some factors to consider this time around:
1) an exchange hack will not crash the price this time around ($65 million bitfinex hack a few months back didnt affect the price).
2) there is massively less supply this time around due to the halving.
3) there is massively more demand this time around caused by the last 2 years of blockchain hype!
4) media phase will have experts talking about the technology instead of the dark side of drug buying online which will get more people interested.
5) the price has to reach $100,000 before we get even close to mainstream usage so bigger percentage price moves than before may happen to get us to those levels within the next 4 years.
People are expecting the price to crash after it hits $5000, but what if (for the factors mentioned above) this time it runs to $30,000 or $50,000 before crashing.
My prediction is it will take 2 more bubbles to get to $100,000. One in 2017 and one more in 2020.
This bubble in 2017 will go from $1000 to $20,000. The next bubble in 2020 will go from $20,000 to above $100,000.

Supply demand basics prove this is the case. A reduction in new supply will always increase the price. The only way it wont is if there is simultaneously a reduction in demand.
If the the new supply reduces by half and simultaneously the demand reduces by 50% the price will remain the same.
So your argument is true if there is always a 50% reduction in demand when the halving occurs which would maintain a constant dollar value. In that case the fact that the halvings are decreasing is rellevant. But it is my belief that demand will continue to increase if not accellerate.
Read my previous reply again to know why i believe that the amount of total supply is irrelevant.

If everyone on earth was already using btc now after only 7-8 years that could only be because every single citizen wanted out of fiat currencies asap back in 2010. That obviously wasnt the case. It will take atleast 20 years (2030) to see widespread mainstream use of bitcoin. The people have to be ready and the technology has to be ready. The only way to accelerate that process would be a global fiat currency collapse which is unlikely if you ask most people. Bitcoin is however forcing people to think about what money is and what a bank controlled cashless society would be like. 
Natural growth to mainstream use will take another 10 years but a loss of faith in fiat currencies would speed that up quite a lot.

Case study i watched, if bitcoin mining consumes enough electricity to push the cost of electricity up within its area then it will be resisted by the public and that mining operation will have its electricity limited. This means the only way to mine will be to use off grid energy sources like solar. 
I see nothing wrong with turning asic producers into solar panel producers too, pushing solar innovation forward.
All mining will do is globally push forward innovation of off grid power sources like solar benefiting humanity and speeding up the process of humanity transitioning away from expensive polluting energy sources and towards cheap sustainable energy sources.

If something can be made and can be sold at a price people value enough to represent a profit, then it will be made. Someone somewhere will make it so they can inturn make a profit. The only thing that can stop that is legislation passed by democratic politicians. 
The best system we have ever had for human innovation and advancement of overall living standards is the incentive of profit. But when you tax that profit to death to give to the people too lazy to build that new product then that is not freedom and very much disincentivizes innovation and growth simply because it removes the incentive of profit.

Then why on earth did the noble prize winning economist Milton Friedman define Inflation and deflation as the expansion or contraction of the money supply. 
This is the real (non-keynesian) definition. Prices are a symptom of inflation not the cause, inflation is the increase in money supply and deflation is the decrease in money supply.
If CPI falling is bad for the economy as you say then why doesnt the government ban shops selling their product on sale. According to you shops having sales should destroy an economy.
Google all you want because all you will find is keynesian nonsense as that is the current mainstream economic theory sponsored by government in universities used to justify fiat currencies, QE and interest rate manipulation.

Bitcoin is the global store of value. Any platform like ethereum that survives will be "pay for use", where you instantly convert your btc into eth just to use ethereum for the time you require.
In the long run the excess market cap of all alts will flow back into btc and bitcoins dominance will trend back towards 80%.
Bitcoins falling dominance throughout 2016 and 2017 was not a function of scaling issues. It was a function of people speculating trying to make "mad gainz" on pump and dumps. Once the ICO bubble pops bitcoin will absorb all of that value again.

Bitcoin is a system where over time the wealth flows to the most productive human beings, you need to benefit humanity to earn bitcoin.
On the other hand fiat is a system where over time the wealth flows to issuers of money, the financial, banking and political sector.
A system that rewards people who make everyones life better is a far more level system than what we have today.

Wrong! The possibility of internatiinal arbitrage means that those reasons you mentioned are not the case. The price is that high in india because their one single exchange is inefficient and hard to buy / there are buy limits. 
Its the same as with GBTC stock, its trades at a similar premium because it is hard to buy from there and its the only option for people who want to buy ina regulated way.
The price in india is not because of their gold import ban or demonetization. It is because their one exchange is the only place to buy and it is inefficient.
However the demand may have been driven by those factors you mentioned but that is not the reason for the premium.

To your points numbered 1 to 4.
1. A certain multiple times the avergae used space over a defined amount of time is not arbitrary. 1mb is arbitrary by definition. Atleast a calculated blocksize serves a purpose.
2. I agree node operators having more data to propagate for a few months is slightly burdensome for them. But what is more burdensome is turning away new users or not allowing the network to work at all for days at a time. A retargeting blocksize allows for usage while scaling then once we have free space again it readjusts down to meet that taking away that slight temporary burden from the node operators. Its a question of do we burden the node operators or the entire ecosystem while this plays out. I believe node operators can handle a slight burden for a few months better than the entire ecosystem can handle the network not working at all for a few months. Imagine we reach this point once again in 5 years when so many more businesess rely on transaction processing, at that point a siezed up network would be completely unacceptable but a temporary slight burden on nodes for a few months is not optimal but it is atleast acceptable.
3. According to this post and OP, satoshi said the blocksize limit would be easy to change once we reach it. A beneficial HF that fixes this debate once and for all with a retargeting blocksize would meet all sides criteria for a solution as it allows blocks to grow only when absolutely necessary and reduces the block size limit when a scaling solution is implemented, in a cyclical loop throughout time.
4. High fees are not important yet.. they will be in the future but that is decades away and by the time high fees are important there will be so many transactions that small fees multiplied by the copious number of transactions will be enough to sustain mining.
Thanks for your argument. I feel that you are more concerned with node count than the ecosystem siezing up. I just happen to prioritize things the other way around.

Nothing can be used as transactional money until it has first proven that it can be a store of value where people can feel safe trusting it to hold their wealth. 
The way you prove out bitcoins store of value promise is through time and more specifically people holding their value in it over time.
What happens as more people hold their wealth in bitcoin? The price rises. What happens when prices rise? Speculators speculate.
So bitcoin will go through a period of time defined as holding and speculating before it becomes trusted enough to be used as a transactional medium.
Once it is trusted merchants will accept it directly, and once merchants accept it directly users can use it as a payment network which then makes more people want to hold their wealth in it and so on.
Evolution of money happens like this:
Store of value &gt; payments
Not like this:
Payments &gt; store of value.
So to answer your question, using bitcoin to trade and speculate is a natural phenomenon that needs to take place before it is used as a payment mechanism, simply because this is the only way to prove out and gain trust in its ability to store value.

Everyone talks about "blockchain technology" as a permanent unalterable ledger completely missing the point that it is not blockchain technology that provides these features, it is decentralisation and proof of work consensus backed by electricity that provide an unalterable permanent ledger. 
So the only way to achieve what they aspire to is to use bitcoin as bitcoin is the only blockchain on earth that provides an unalterable permanent ledger, everything else is just a database with hash pointers!
When I read articles like this I simply replace the word blockchain with bitcoin. Then it becomes obvious how bullish this is for bitcoin.

Is this post a joke? To be a user you are required to buy bitcoin.. even if it is behind the scenes on a money transfer app and you dont see it..
So therefore the more users there are the more bitcoin is being bought and sold which leads to more accumulated periods of time where there is more and more bitcoin being taken off the tradeable market which in turn affects the supply vs demand equation and eventually leads to higher prices..
Each additional node or each additional user adds value to the entire network. This is commonly known as network effect.. this would no doubt have an affect on the price in some way, it is however unclear as to what this affect would be and whether it would be correlated at all..
I think OP is confused, obviously doesnt understand that bitcoin has a fixed limited supply issuance curve. Adding a user does NOT magically add more bitcoin to the network.

Because this is the begining of rampant speculation for a long overdue and expected price rise into the thousands of dollars.. plus new supply was cut in half a few months back.. its all about supply and demand.. supply got cut in half and that effect has increased demand, leading to higher prices that hold their ground.. its the market taking the price up to where it should be valued..

If they move to the next cheapest place they will not be causing a problem. Mining will not be allowed in places where it affects the local community. 
There is nothing wrong with using electricity. The use of electricity benefits humanity and I can think of no better use than using electricity to prevent the suffering of an entire nation by eliminating the threat of hyperinflation.
If miners are forced to not use grid energy they will innovate other alternatives. Over a period longer than 10 years it is currently cheaper to use solar and battery than it is to use the grid and if miners are innovating their own solar tech it will bring those prices down more for everyone.
So forcing miners off of grid power will fuel sustainable power innovation. 
Sustainable power does not pollute and forcing miners to innovate off grid energy sources will benefit all people by bringing down the cost of sustainable energy sources.

So both definitions of inflation and deflation are correct then.
A distinction needs to be made in economic theory between CPI inflation/deflation and money stock inflation/deflation.
The confusion is in trying use one word to describe both. Its like trying to tell someone they are "right" yet they think your trying to tell them to turn "right" at the next corner.
Money stock inflation and deflation happens, and CPI inflation and deflation also happens.
The world of economics would be so much more easy to discuss if we used different terms for both.
However in the meantime my opinion still stands that CPI deflation is not bad infact it improves affordability and helps those on minimum wages, but under a fiat system money stock deflation is bad as it represents a credit crunch which prevents the economy from growing.

I was thinking about a hardfork in 50 years or so that tries to create a new chain with no btc supply cap to fund miners by inflation. If somehow everyone on earth has been convinced that it is necessary to create inflation to fund miners, and a majority want to adopt the new chain, how could this work with everyones funds tied up in lightning.
If the new chain doesnt support lightning then no one will adopt it as it would be chaos and effectively rolling back all transactions that hapoened since previous channel closings.
Does this mean if LN is adopted broadly then no hard forks will ever be possible, effectively keeping the 21 million btc supply cap safe forever?
Edit: if the new chain can adopt and snapshot the existing state of the LN protocol this HF scenario could work but as more and more layers are added to bitcoin it makes it basically impossible to hard fork a core protocol change like the supply cap. Correct?

Miners will be competing more leading to much higher levels of decentralisation for bitcoin.
Also miners dont sell bitcoin at a loss, they hold it until the price they can sell it for represents a profit. This means new bitcoin supply will be held off of the market which will increase the price even if demand stays static until the price represents a profit. In other words, where the hash rate goes so does the price.

But with lightning for example most people will close channel states rarely meaning a fork to the last correct state could effectively roll back hundreds of thousands of transactions over many participants making it extremely problematic and highly resisted. This is not to mention other 2nd layers or 3rd layers built on top of lightning itself.
I have a feeling the core protocol is set now that 2nd layers are being utilised. Any hard fork would be highly resisted due to layer disruption. This is good in that the 21 million supply cap is effectively set in stone but blocksize increases will only be allowed by optimization not by hard forking a change. Which is fine aslong as the 1mb blocksize doesnt end up representing a network that is unusable.

I want to pay someone $50 over lightning and they want to accept it. For them to accept it they need a lightning wallet with an open channel. They dont have any btc at all as they have never used btc before. 
If i was going to pay him on-chain it doesnt matter that he has no btc, he can just recieve whatever i send him minus the on-chain fee.
But what if i use lightning and want to send the payment to him via lightning to avoid the $100 on-chain fee. How can he accept a lightning payment if he doesnt have a lightning wallet or any btc to fund a lightning channel?

There are a thousand ways to scale a public open blockchain. They just take time to develop and most people cant grasp the fact bitcoin is always evolving let alone understand the technical work going on behind the scenes.
In bitcoins case specifically devs are implementing upgrades that reduce the load on the blockchain itself making each transaction take up less space thereby increasing the amount of on chain transactions per second, while at the same time developing 2nd layer solutions like lightning network where each single on chain transaction can proxy for thousands of other transactions through bitcoins limited smart contract capabilities.
Scaling will happen, it will just take time for the end user to see it.

Debt based money has existed for 100 years. Gold as money has existed for 5000 years.
We didnt get to where we are today by creating money out of debt, as a civilization we got to where we are today by using a scarce asset as money for both the public and private sector. The late 1800s, an era of great invention and great prosperity between the napoleanic war and WW1 was a world based on the classical gold standard.
If creating money out of nothing by way of debt does nothing but create wealth then can we please create $100,000,000.00 for every citizen and be done with it. According to you that would fix all our problems including inequality without any consequence whatsoever.
Public sector debt is not without consequence. The consequence is the risk in the bond market and value of the currency itself. You are very naieve if you believe otherwise.
You talk as if debt doesnt have a cost. It does. Bonds are the mechanism used to create government debt/deficit spending. These bonds are owned by investors all over the world including other governments. The rate paid to investors on those bonds is paid via taxation. If rates rise the cost to prevent a soverign debt crisis is unavoidable resulting in a currency crisis. The only way to prevent rates rising is for the central bank to buy the treasuries bonds directly prividing demand for the market (QE), however this increases money stock which leads to inflation when velocity increases which can devalue a currency over time leading to economic stagnation. Economic stagnation does not increase the wealth of a country.
Its almost like you think a government can somehow dictate its currencies value relative to others. This is not how the world works and you are very misguided to believe otherwise.
Would you also state that if the chinese government sold all their US bonds into the market tomorrow that there would be zero effect on the dollar.

Futures are no different than a bet on bitcoins price.
You can print $1 trillion and use it to short bitcoin futures, all that will happen is you will loose your money if the price rises. Its no different than betting on a horse race, the amount you bet doesnt affect the outcome. Fundamentals and TA matter, the amount of short future positions is irrelevant. It may look scary but fundamentals and TA vastly outweigh the effect of shorts.
Its funny watching the metals markets these days. Net shorts are always wrong. Everytime institutions are net short the market rises and vise versa.
If you think the price is down because of futures alone you are naieve. If you think futures can artifically suppress price you are also wrong. 
If people are using futures to hedge long btc positions the they can sell btc into a falling market and make profit on their futures, but when the tide turns and the price re-enters a new bull market they will be closing out their short futures early and holding their btc as expiry approaches.

Utility like uncensorable fast cheap global payments is important. However global adoption will never happen if the store of value use case has not first been proven. No one will store their money in something they dont trust no matter how efficient it is.
My point is this. Bitcoin will go through a period of proving its store of value properties (with future utility in mind). Then once its store of value properties are undoubtably trusted it will move into its utility phase.

His argument then back in 2011 is exactly the same as today.
"Bitcoin has no value because it has no other use than someone else wanting to accept it. Gold has intrinsic value, gold is valuable all by itself."
This is the most ignorant argument against bitcoin I have ever heard. He just clearly refuses to research the technology, he has probably never even read the whitepaper.
But having said that in Peter's defense this guy was extrodinarily horrible at explaining bitcoin.
It seems Peter made his mind up after this interview 8 years ago and refuses to allow any change in his perception or understanding. A classic case of an old goat stuck in his ways and resistant to change.

And so it begins...
Andreas predicted this phenomenon in one of his talks back in 2012 or 2013.
Companies are starting to realise bitcoin is more valuable than fiat, and bitcoin holders are realising they dont want to spend their bitcoin. Greshams law. So now companies will discount their items if people pay in bitcoin to incentivise their consumers to use bitcoin instead of fiat. At the same time companies can save the 2% to 3% they pay on each sale that uses credit cards.
This phenomenon is real and we are going to see much more of it going forward.

I think in the future there will be one peer2pool that everyone uses for mining (to make rewards guaranteed in every block no matter what your hashing power is). This decentralised p2pool will be made up of a few large mining operations and the other 80% will represent every smart hardware device that exists in 20 years time. The internet of things / machine payable web / 21.co etc

The blocksize limit was useful when it was way above the actual used amount of block space, therefore allowing growth but preventing "wasted" disk space.
But when it is so close to the actual used amount of block space it serves no useful purpose. It drastically limits natural growth and makes ddosing the network even easier. 
The block size limit is only a useful measure when it allows room for growth while preventing massive sustained spam attacks on the network.
Thats why a blocksize that automatically adjusts to 10x the average space used over say the last 6 months is a much better solution. An automatic blocksize retarget every 6 months!
If segwit and LN activate then there is no need to raise the blocksize at all as the space used will remain 10x below the limit.
Why people cant see this still baffles me to this day.
Imagine if the block space being used was just under 1kb per block when satoshi implemented the blocksize limit.. would he have chosen a 1kb blocksize limit then? No because it would have done more harm than good! The same is true today! There us an obvious reason he chose a blocksize limit way above the amount of blockspace being used.
I dont care if we raise the blocksize limit OR scale off chain.. either way works for me.. but what is upsetting is this middle ground where we are living in a world with huge transaction wait times.. a block size that retargets every 6 months or so fixes that to allow for gowth and usage during these stressful times while we scale..
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:15:50
Very true.
However my theory goes something like this.
Throughout history money has always been the thing that is the most "saleable" and the most "scarce". Saleable meaning it is easy to sell, in the case of money this is its transportability and divisibility. 
Scarcity is just what humans naturally trend towards as the less new supply issued the more you retain your value in that medium compared to other mediums.
We see this today among fiat currencies. The currencies that have the lowest rate of new issuance are the strongest and globally recognised (usd, euro, yen). The currencies that have the highest rate of new issuance are the weakest and rarely if ever used internationally, sometimes even completely abandoned (inr, php, bolivar). Strength in a currency also benefits its saleability as it is easier to find someone that will accept it.
Bitcoin is more transportable and more divisible than anything we have ever used as money before in history, and its new issuance rate is already below that of the USD and will soon be below that of gold which will naturally make it the strongest currency on earth, and that strength will also benefit its saleability.
Now the most important part of bitcoins transportability, divisibility and its scarcity is the fact the core code is immutable. If it wasnt immutable none of this would matter.
Bitcoin is the only coin that has proven out its resistance to protocol changes, and it took 9 years. Even ethereum can change dramatically, we saw this with the DAO hack and subsequent roll back of the chains history, along with PoW giving way to PoS. Vitalik does what Vitalik wants. Plus ethereum has no defined limit on its total supply, it will inflate indefinitely. All other alts are similar wherein there is an identifiable handful of devs that can change anything they want about their coin within a week. Even Bcash started its life off by hard forking a change and they have since had many more hard forks. If a coin hard forks core protocol changes every month how immutable can it really be, the answer is not very.
Remember segwit was only a backwards compatible soft fork, not a core protocol change the whole network had to accept.
So my opinion is bitcoin is the most immutable by far and until some other coin can prove it is more immutable at a point where it holds more value than bitcoin then it will be very hard to beat that superiority. 
Bitcoin is immutable at a market cap of $100 billion, how many other coins can claim that.
Bitcoin has no competition. But unfortunately speculative money pushing alts has hidden this.
Remember bitcoins use case is money. It is not competing for smart contracts or decentralized storage or decentralized compute or decentralized identity or any of those other use cases. Its just money. Its only competition is fiat.
One day soon bitcoin will be money and your smart wallet will "atomically" swap btc for alts by the second to pay for the real time use of dapps etc. In exactly the same way as you take dollars today to buy phone credit to make mobile phone calls. Is phone credit a competitor of USD? no, it is just a use case money can buy. In the same way Ethereum or EOS dapps are just a use case bitcoin can buy.

My journey started when I became dissolusioned with property investing and wanted to understand why the 08' crash happened. Through Robert Kiyosaki I found Mike Maloney and was blown away by his take on the economy, started to understand monetary history and dabbled in buying precious metals like gold. Then through that whole scene I heard about Bitcoin from some of the gold bug video bloggers. Looked into it and it blew my mind. I have been buying ever since!
I think there are a few prerequisites to understanding bitcoin. 
1) monetary history and the fact that paper money is the exception and has no value besides what we imagine it has.
2) decentralised networks that cannot be shut down (like bittorrent)
3) Network Effect. Basically how networks gain adoption and grow even if they are just "good enough".

What this shows:
Investment funds have fiduciary responsibility to buy bonds, they have to as its in their charter. They have no choice.
They also dont care about the yield because they are only after the capital gain. They dont care if a bond yield is -1% because if its going to -3% they will still make money on the rise in price of the bond itself. Yield and price are inveresly correllated.
So this game will keep going on and on into deeper and deeper negative territory until inflation spikes forcing interest rates higher which ends the bond bubble and very quickly we will see bond prices collapse and interest rates rise dramatically. 
Thats when we enter a period of recessionary stagflation defined by depression like economic conditions along with high inflation and high interest rates. Thats the end game. If inflation gets out of hand expect currency crises to accompany soverign debt crises.
End result = an exodus out of anything negatively affected by recessionary forces and high interest rates like stocks bonds and realestate and a rush into assets that are separate from the traditional financial system like Gold and Bitcoin.
In other words there will soon be a time within the next few years when stocks bonds and realestate are all crashing around the world while Gold and Bitcoin are rising dramatically.

This is my train of thought too.. force everyone into bank accounts so when its time for the bail ins to begin they can announce it overnight and there is nothing we can do about it.. bail ins were recently made legal in aus for anyone holding over 20k in a bank account.. I now refuse to hold more than 15k in my account at any one time, so what else can i do but buy btc or gold.. but wait after demonetization will come gold confiscation! Just like in india right now.. so at that point the only option is to put your money in falling stocks or rising bitcoin! They have to do this to make inevitable bail ins work, but they are also shooting themselves in the foot in the process as it will cause mass flooding into btc which will ultimately destroy the aussie dollar long term..

Why would you want BTC to be stable against a fiat currency that falls in purchasing power year after year? If bitcoin were to become stable against other goods, in that some amount of btc could always buy the same amount of another good over time, then its going to appear as if the price of bitcoin (denominated in the falling fiat currency) is rising. 
So even if bitcoin is "stable" its still going to appear as if its price is rising.
Imposing taxes on gains denominated in a fiat currency that is constantly declining in value is a joke TBH.

Full Article:
More than half of the world’s banks are too weak to survive a downturn, according to a survey from consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co.
A majority of banks globally may not be economically viable because their returns on equity aren’t keeping pace with costs, McKinsey said in its annual review of the industry released Monday. It urged firms to take steps such as developing technology, farming out operations and bulking up through mergers ahead of a potential economic slowdown.
“We believe we’re in the late economic cycle and banks need to make bold moves now because they are not in great shape,” Kausik Rajgopal, a senior partner at McKinsey, said in an interview. “In the late cycle, nobody can afford to rest on their laurels.”
The decade since the global financial crisis has seen a wave of innovation in financial services, bringing new competitors from fintech startups to giants like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Banks have pondered whether to compete with, partner with or acquire some of these newcomers. Some established firms have sought to rebrand as technology companies, in part to attract hard-to-get talent.
McKinsey, whose clients are some of the biggest corporations in the world, consults on topics ranging from strategy and technology to mergers &amp; acquisitions, outsourcing and stock offerings. In its report, the firm said banks risk “becoming footnotes to history” as new entrants change consumer behavior. Most recent attempts by banks to boost efficiency have been “business-as-usual,” it said.
Banks allocate just 35% of their information-technology budgets to innovation, while fintechs spend more than 70%, McKinsey said. Combined with regulatory factors lowering the barrier to entry -- like open banking and looser requirements for startups -- the environment is increasingly conducive for newer firms to take share from banks.
The report points to Amazon.com Inc. in the U.S. and Ping An in China as examples of technology firms that are capturing financial-services customers. To make matters worse for the old guard, the new players tend to go after the business areas that create the highest returns at banks -- credit cards, for example.
Lenders can cut costs and find funds for technology by outsourcing what McKinsey calls “non-differentiating activities,” including some trading and compliance functions. Banks “need to get much more comfortable with external partnerships and being able to leverage talent externally,” Rajgopal said.
Another way to free up money: get bigger. BB&amp;T Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc. said as much when they announced their decision to combine earlier this year -- the biggest U.S. bank merger since the financial crisis. Rajgopal said he expects M&amp;A to continue in the late cycle.
“Going forward, scale will likely matter even more as banks head into an arms race on technology,” the report says.

He didnt start screaming he was a "bitcoin millionaire" until late in the 2013 run up from $200 to $1200. So I would guesstimate he has more than 1000 btc but less than 3000 btc. He would have blown a portion of that in late 2017 too most likely.
So for the sake of argument I will guess he has 2000 btc, currently worth $20 million.

Yes everyone has a different opinion on where bitcoin is going and nothing is certain. This is just my optimistic opinion. I believe one btc will be a large amount of wealth if and when bitcoin grows to dominate global currency markets. I can forsee a day where having one btc would be like someone today saying they are a millionaire. A sort of status statement and display of wealth. If you have more than one btc you made it, in the same way that if you have more than one million dollars you made it.

Hard forks dont increase supply. Hard forks create completely separate alt coins. Bcash is an alt coin. There are thousands of alt coins 99% of which are scams at worst and at best cannot claim immutability. Ethereum is proof of vitalik and Bcash is hard fork galore.

So he is sittng on $264,000,000 and doesnt want to touch it until its the worlds defacto money. Even if that means he has to keep working a day job until then. I dont buy it.
The first time I heard him screaming he was a bitcoin millionaire was in late 2013 infact there was one specific episode in 2013 where he literally mentions that he just became a bitcoin millionaire on that day. That means he has somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000 bitcoin. I think he has 2,000 btc not 22,000. This also makes more sense as 2k btc is only worth $20 million today hence his desire to wait longer before quitting his day job.

Gold went down in 2008 initially because the dollar rose as people chased the percieved safety of treasury bills. This time around the dollar will be falling and people will be fleeing US bonds causing the price of gold to rise.
Instead of gold going down in 2008 then up until 2011, it will go up in 2020 then up again through to 2024. And bitcoin will follow IMO.

When you go to the atm why would you take out 5 20s when you can take out 1 100 dollar note.. its all about inflation over the past 20-30 years.. just because the use of $100 notes has increased does not mean its because of criminal intent..
This measure also does not stop cash jobs or increase tax revenue, people know how to use 5 20s instead of 1 $100 note.. all this is doing is moving savings from cash to bank accounts to facilitate bank bail ins.

Democracy is mob rule. The many elect the person that will give them the most free stuff at the expense of others. It is essentially people using politicians to legalize theft.
Free markets are just freedom of individual choice. Your neighbour cant go to a politician and ask them to take your ferrari away so things are fair. Thats an over simplification, obviously im referring to legislation and taxation that forces you to sell your ferrari to cover the new tax bill.
Free markets are just letting mature adults look after themselves and make their own decisions as long as every economic interaction that happens doesnt hurt anyone else and is mutually agreed to. 
The problem is when you get people that think its the governments job to tax the rich to give to them, this is what creates an environment of legalized theft.
There are no real true free market countries today. Its like trying to choose the best of a bad bunch.

If another crypto somehow manages to create a monetary policy that is even more scarce than bitcoin in a more immutable way then yes all bets are off. But today bitcoins monetary policy is the most scarce and the most immutable along with already being the most fairly distributed. Even ethereum cant guarantee immutability.

I believe bitcoin will be the global monetary store of value and alts will be "pay per use" where your smart wallet will "atomically" turn bitcoin into whatever alt you need for whatever dapp or use by the second as you use it.
Therefore the value of bitcoin will be based on monetary use and the value of all alts will be based on separate utility functions. Just like the value of the dollar today vs the function of turning dollars into phone credit to make mobile phone calls.

I guess my thought process is that yes those things are great and will be amazing once bitcoin is globally adopted, but if bitcoin didnt have scarcity none of that would matter.
Scarcity comes first, utility comes second. Bitcoin will not gain global adoption until its scarcity is first undoubtably trusted.
We will go through a period of "store of value" being proved out first and then move into a period of utility.
This is also why anyone who says bitcoin is a joke because no one is accepting it for payment is completely missing the point. Bitcoin will need to prove out its store of value properties first before people trust it to utilize it for payments globally. 
Store of value comes first (with the promise of future utility) and real utility comes second.

Lets make it simpler then.
If the eurozone countries all used gold as money, perhaps a digital gold standard where gold is held in reserve by each indivdual nation and digital gold backed tokens are issued as money, that would not have the effect of southern european nations dragging down the EU. If southern european nations dont grow then that would not affect the EU it would just be detrimental to the countries that dont grow.
The EU would be using one currency, gold. But they would be separated economically. The problem arises when you economically tie countries together using a centrally managed political currency like the euro.
The reason the southern european nations affect the whole EU is because they are now politically and economically tied because of the euro.
The euro is a political currency. Gold and bitcoin are politically neutral.
I hope that analogy helps you understand the difference between a neutral currency and a political currency and how they differ in their architecture and consequent effects.

Bitcoin is not currently a better medium of exchange than fiat. It is a better store of value than fiat. For the simple reason its supply cant be diluted and its new issuance rate is already lower than that of major currencies. 
No one would buy bitcoin if it could be easily diluted with infinite amounts of new supply no matter how fast or cheap transactions are. So the only thing that matters is its store of value properties.

Gold, no. Because gold can not function in physical form today in our digital world, and gold standards never work because there are always more gold backed units of currency issued than gold held in reserves which discards the need for gold in the first place.
Bitcoin, yes.

It wasnt priced in before the 2016 halving or before the 2012 halving even though everyone back then was saying it was already priced in, so why should it be different now?

Government has no right to put its citizens into debt, just as my home builder has no right to take on debt in my name. in fact that is stated in the constitution.
What you are alluding to is dictatorship.
Government debt is at its fundamental core a mechanism used to create money out of nothing for deficit spending. This reduces the overall good of the entire nation by way of inflation and increased cost of living.
In that sense debt is not a big deal and relatively unnoticable if it doesnt cause a dramatic increase in the stock of money, but go just a little bit too far and you end up in a vicious cycle leaving a country declining in overall wealth which after a few decades can destroy an economy. Saying government debt doesnt matter is an extremely dangerous idea that has been proven to cause detrimental economic effects over and over again in many countries around the world. This doesnt even take into account debt levels that collapse a bond market and destroy a currency far faster than decade long decay of a currency through inflation.

Wages around the world currently are not keeping pace with inflation in the least, this is fact. Plus it is about to get a lot worse as the Fed wants CPI to rise above 2% for "symmetry".
You can argue as much as you want dreaming about a world where wages keep up with CPI but the next 3 to 5 years are going to prove you massively wrong. Have you ever heard of stagflation, defined as a period of high inflation and low economic growth. This is exactly what the world is moving towards now, heck even Alan Greenspan is calling for stagflation.
If you seriously believe wage growth is a function of inflation you are extremely misguided and naieve.
I mean jeez the fact the term stagflation exists at all proves you wrong, let alone the period during the 1970s around the world being defined as stagflation.
If you were right the term stagflation shouldnt even exist.
And yes I understand the difference between CPI and base money supply. When you have a supply of money that doesnt grow prices fall relative to increases in GDP growth. This is how workers can recieve no wage increase yet still experience their salary purchasing more, all while businesses retain the same percentage profit margin.
The 19th century wasnt defined as La Belle Epoque because gold was a horrible system of money. It was the single most prosperous period in human history directly because people experienced purchasing power increases without relying on salaray increases from businesses, because they used a system of money that could not be inflated (base money). The opposite of an inflationary system.
In terms of bitcoin vs fiat and base money inflation vs CPI inflation. Fiat has base money inflation and CPI inflation. Bitcoin has base money inflation currently which will be zero (not base money deflation) and it has negative CPI and last time I checked lower prices fueled consumption not higher prices. Unless of course you believe people avoid sales and try to find the product they want to buy for the most expensive price possible.
I see all economic theories and understand they are just that, a theory. Economics is not science and one should not dismiss one theory for another. The problem I see with your understanding is that you have embraced keynesian economic theory as factual science when it is nothing more than theory, which has worked well for 20% of the world up until now yet failed 80% of the world. You cant call something a success if it only works in 20% of cases. That would be like saying a specific medicine is successful if it cures patients 20% of the time but causes premature death in the other 80% of cases.
The best thing anyone can do is to stop taking one solitary economic "theory" as factual gospel and allow discussion of all economic theories.
Also finally to speak to your point on investment. You are reffering to investment in stocks and other assets due to the fact people dont want to hold dollars. This is not how you grow an economy.
You grow an economy by investing in plant and equiptment not by speculating in the stock market. In that sense investment comes from reduced consumption, you need to save before you can invest. A world which discourages savings by way of inflation leads to an overall reduction in investment. This can be seen today with the rise of stock market and property market speculation and the fall of real plant and equiptment investment leading to slow economic growth. Instead of investing to grow the economy now we are throwing money into speculative assets. That is not a sign of a healthy economy.

Same is true of gold. They can try to push it down to make money shorting futures but fundamentals matter way more than how many people are shorting.
Futures provide an incentive to see the price fall but that doesnt equate into the price falling just because people want it to.
The only way to supress price is to sell, and to sell you first need to buy or borrow from someone who has previously bought.
As soon as everyone who wants to sell has sold then the only way to suppress price is to buy again before you sell which increases the price and changes fundamentals into bullish.

Bitcoin has always reached a level of 1.5% volatility after a big run. We are at 2.7% now so volatility most likely has to fall further before another bull run begins. This doesnt mean the price has to fall, it just means that bitcoin has to go side ways or remain flat for a while longer still.

If you give everyone an extra $1000 than they have now all that will happen is prices will increase appropriately to absorb the extra money being spent. "Prices are like a sponge, water is like the amount of money chasing those goods, if you increase the amount of water the sponge gets larger too".. supply and demand works for pieces of fiat paper too. More money being spent means prices rise. So at the end of the day people have more dollars but can still only buy the same amount of goods and services..

Answer: utility + scarcity = value, this is true of all economically valuable things on earth.

Are you saying the reason more than 6 billion people dont have bank accounts or credit cards is because they are too poor? You really are an asshole. You really think that 6 billion people cant afford the couple of dollars it costs to open an account.
The main problem with banking in developing countries is lack of ID and lack of proof of residence, not money, this is well documented. These people dont lack money they lack a residential address, they lack a drivers licence, they lack a passport. Get your facts straight.
To get a credit card first you need your salary credited directly into your bank account, only then will you get a credit card thrown at you as you state. And if you cant get a bank account how can you get a credit card.
Also inflation is a huge priority for the developing world. Thats all they talk about.

Watch this 2 min video:
In todays market rising velocity alone would cause inflation and inflation causes all prices to rise, if that makes sense. Basically the total money stock wont increase necessarily (maybe) but it will purchase less causing prices to rise, including the price of bitcoin and the "price" of GDP. The total money stock wont increase persè, it will purchase less as velocity increases causing prices to rise therefore causing GDP to be denominated in devalued dollars making GDP look like its growing when it may infact be falling. So Tim Draper is basically saying (correctly) that velocity will cause inflation which will lead to all things being priced in devalued dollars, including bitcoin.
In other words, total money stock may not physically rise but inflation driven rising prices will cause the value of money stock to grow to represent all those rising prices.

Yet another master piece by the best public speaker in all of crypto land.
This is the first time I have heard of globalization in the context of bitcoin.
It makes so much sense. Globalization should be naturally viewed of as a good thing for human progress. But it has a bad stigma and reputation because the way the world is coming together currently is under the rules and sanctions of centralized powers to the detriment of individuals and emerging economies around the world (the euro experiment is a perfect example of this). But if globalization forms under a neutral system of money it can be one of the most empowering forces for individuals and the advancement of humanity.

@_date: 2019-08-23 22:57:10
This is correct.
Investment funds have fiduciary responsibility to buy bonds, they have to as its in their charter.
They also dont care about the yield because they are only after the capital gain. They dont care if a bond yield is -1% because if its going to -3% they will still make money on the rise in price of the bond itself. Yield and price are inveresly correllated.
So this game will keep going on and on into deeper and deeper negative territory until inflation spikes forcing interest rates higher which ends the bond bubble and very quickly we will see bond prices collapse and interest rates rise dramatically. 
Thats when we enter a period of recessionary stagflation defined by depression like economic conditions along with high inflation and high interest rates. Thats the end game. If inflation gets out of hand expect currency crises to accompany soverign debt crises.
End result = an exodus out of anything negatively affected by recessionary forces and high interest rates like stocks bonds and realestate and a rush into assets that are separate from the traditional financial system like Gold and Bitcoin.

Sounds like you just hope it goes to 1k ~3k so you can buy back in cheaper. Bitcoin doesnt NEED to go anywhere, It could go up, down or sideways from here.
Also a multi year bear market like 2014-2016 was the anomaly, not the rule. Bitcoin has been through 6 major crashes of more than 60% to 80%, all of them except the 2014 crash recovered within 1 year. The 2014 crash was the first time it took longer than 1 year to recover and that was because the mtgox hack caused 80% of all bitcoiners to loose all their money and everyone had to start from scratch if they didnt completely give up on bitcoin all together. This crash has no real negative news around it, just regular market cycles. So I wouldnt be surprised if this bear market finds a bottom and starts recovering before the end of this year.

The push to integrate cryptocurrencies into global commerce looks a step closer to reality.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. said Monday that it will begin testing its consumer app for digital assets with its partner Starbucks Inc. in the first half of 2020. That follows a jump in Bitcoin futures on the exchange to a record.
A total 1,179 monthly Bitcoin futures changed hands on Oct. 25, according to the company. None of the daily contracts traded. The ICE contracts differ from other Bitcoin derivatives because they deliver actual Bitcoin if held to expiration, unlike cash-settled contracts at competitor CME Group Inc.
“We’ve assembled a strong team of payments engineers and are nearing completion of our core payments and compliance platform,” Mike Blandina, chief product officer at ICE’s Bakkt unit, said in a blog post. “We’re now focused on the development of the consumer app and merchant portal, as well as testing with our first launch partner, Starbucks, which we expect in the first half of next year.”
The Friday volume was four times the 288 contracts traded on Oct. 24 and nearly double the 590 contracts traded on Oct. 23. Only 80 monthly contracts traded Oct. 22, according to the company.
The beverage retailer teamed up with ICE and several other partners in August 2018 to create the Bakkt venture.

Nope. Sorry, democracies are mob rule, everyone has to do what the majority wants, which can be good but can also usually lead to welfare state style economies that limit peoples freedom to succeed and instead see "success" taxed to death to give a good lifestyle to all, which sounds moral but stops an economy growing and innovating so is detrimental over periods longer than a few decades.
Free markets or libertarianism on the other hand do not allow for mob rule. Its natural law, you get what you work for.
In other words democracies lead to an incentivization of entitlement. Libertarianism leads to pure growth which raises the standard of living for all.

"Revisionist" as in saying gold was bad and deflationary completely ignoring the gilded age in America and La Belle Epoque in europe under the classical gold standard...
Inflation and deflation have throughout history been defined as a contraction or expansion of money supply. The rise of keynesian economics in the 1930s "revised" this definition to represent CPI.
Try to understand monetary histroy does not begin 100 years ago, it goes back roughly 5000 years believe it or not.

I wish I had a lot of bitcoin. The only way for me to get bitcoin is to work my ass off earning fiat to buy more. So I am an example of someone making humanity better to obtain bitcoin because I am selling my labor to a company that provides a service people want so I can then obtain bitcoin.
When I do manage to obtain the luxury of buying some more I am taking it out of the hands of people with a lot of bitcoin. They sell because they value present consumption over future consumption, especially as no one knows if bitcoin will even work or die tomorrow. This is called the process of "distribution".
Who on earth is going to sit on $10 million worth of bitcoin if it could go to zero tomorrow.
You seem to believe no one sells. If no one sold how would anyone buy? How would a market even exist. If no one sold any coinbase bitstamp and bitfinex wouldnt exist. Hell if no one sold any bitcoin mt gox would still be an online exchange for trading Magic The Gathering cards.

The big picture is that the money is getting distributed through people selling as they make profits... we started with a handful owning all the bitcoin, then a few thousand, then a few million, now close to a hundred million people own btc. Soon hundreds of millions will own btc. 
It used to be common to have 1000 btc, then it was common to have just 100, then 10, now 1btc, etc etc.. The guys who used to have 1000s all probably have only a few hundred now. The guys who have a few hundred now will soon have a 10 or 20 and on it goes..

Decentralised storage and compute are excellent ideas, but I always did wonder why they required their own token. Like you said the most logical path forward is 2nd layer solutions on bitcoin that achieve the same thing. 
It will take a long time to figure out how to achieve decentralised (insert app use case).. what we know we can do now is decentralised movement of tokens from one address to another. Thats it. Once we have immutable money for the world the rest of those use cases will follow.
The app platforms today are equivelant to using dollars to buy microsoft money to then be able to use an app. Talk about inefficient.
Like Saifedean Ammous says. Money just wants to be one. In the long run all these "use cases" will run on bitcoin somewhere within bitcoins software stack of multiple layers.

This is a precursor to bail-ins.. force everyone to hold their wealth in a bank account so when it is required the banks can easily take it as part of a cyprus-style bail-in (for which law exists now to make this legal in Australia).

Are you implying that all existing hodl stock is as available for sale as newly mined supply at the same price as newly mined supply that need to be sold to cover electricity costs of mining? 
To understand why the halving has had such dramatic effect on price in the past you need to remove existing stock from the equation. Hardly anyone sells exisiting stock after a halving at the beginning of a bull market. The only significant selling is from miners whos mined coins need to be sold to cover the costs of mining, and when a bull market starts even they try to sell as little as possible.

Everyone has their price not all want to hold forever.. so alot of early coins will get sold as the price gets over 100k or 1 million. But that does not detract from your argument.. I believe what you are saying is dpot on!
Personally I would sell small amounts at 100k then again at 1 million then again at 5 million due to the time value of money! I would rather take smaller profits now to fund a passive income than wait linger to have more money that i dont really need... passive income and early retirement is more important to me than a large amount of wealth on paper but still having to work.

There is only one answer. 
The only way an alt can dethrone bitcoin is to provide a monetary policy thats more immutable than bitcoins and is a better store of value by way of base money stock inflation rates.
The thing is, it is hard to fairly distribute a new currency over time while still maintaining immutable scarcity which provides trust to own it and hold it for long periods of time.
You need to find the right balance of issuance and scarcity. Bitcoin has done that. 
Alts cannot gurantee immutable monetary policy, not even ethereum, which is why alts will do well but they will not be used as a store of value, they will be "pay per use". In aggregate and over the long term people will hold their wealth in bitcoin and convert to alts for their utility when needed via a smart wallet.

If your country taxes capital gain on property then they likely also tax bitcoin. 
If you have only ever bought and held then there is no tax but if you have sold btc fiat or turned btc into another altcoin or used btc to buy a good or service then that is a capital gains tax event and requires you to keep records and pay up what you owe.

Every time you spend btc it is considered a CGT event requiring you to record the transaction details including the price of bitcoin at the time of the transaction. This is why bitcoin works better in countries with no CGT.

Then i also dont approve of humanity using electricity to watch youtube.

Every economist fears the word deflation in the sense of contracting credit supply and subsequent asset price deflation because paying down debt effectively reduces the overall money supply. Please tell me how a
In a bitcoin based economy the amount of bitcoin in existance can decline through paying off debt. The problem with deflation is the effective elimination of money causing an economy to contract. If I loan you bitcoin and you pay me back the total amount of bitcoin doesnt chage. But if a bank creates money to issue a loan it increases the money supply and when it is paid of that reduces the money supply. Therefore deflation is only a problem under debt base money like fiat. Not a problem under asset based money like gold or bitcoin. 
During the gilded age in America and La belle Epoque in europe from 1870 to the start of WW1 the world was using the classical gold standard. This was not a time of deflationary chaos it was a time if great peace prosperity and invention.
Yes not everyone plays by the rules and some mining operations will utilise pollutant producing energy but this will be the exception not the rule. Like I said over a period of longer than 10 years it is already cheaper and more efficient to use solar and battery than it is to use the grid. And dont forget this is the cost in developed nations where rule of law is followed. In developing nations grid based electricity is far more expensive and unreliable. Their electricity costs more per Kwh than the US and they have blackouts every other day. Who would want to run a multi million dollar company solely reliant on electricty in that environment.

What I take away from this is that even the people who got into btc back in 2010/2011 would have only amassed a few thousand btc under $1 like this guy, and most of these lucky people (also like this guy) would have sold a large majority of those coins between $1 and $100.
Most of the super early adopters like this guy would currently have 100 btc at most, not 1000 anymore.
The only non-corporate individuals with more than 1000 btc would be the lunatic fringe fanatics and developers of which there were only a handful. For the rest of us it would be a miracle to have more than 100 btc, epic to have more than 10 btc and currently extremely good for your future if you have 1 btc.
Remember that soon having one whole bitcoin will be considered an extreme display of wealth if not the epitome of wealth exhibition.

Since when has 200 different national currencies been good for global trade, forex risk, fair global competition between businesses etc. How efficient is business when you need to waste time and resources dedicating effort to following the forex market instead of focusing on your product. What if you dedicate 30 years to building a competative advantage only to see that advantage wiped out in 1 month because your nations currency rises against other currencies.
The whole point of inventing "money" was to do away with barter because barter is inefficient. In fact the "invention" of money was just people deciding to use one single store of value for trade within a community to maximize efficiency of trade instead of using many different mediums.
We now live in one globalized community so we should logically use one globalized currency to make trade more efficient and fair.
When you think about it we literally have a system of inefficient barter today trying to trade global currencies with eachother. Forex is currency barter.
"Money just wants to be one" - Saifedean Ammous
Even today we see the world trending towards a system of one global reserve currency (USD) where it is permitted. Not that it will last because it gives one countries government the ability to export inflation to the detriment of other countries economies, which will not last over the long term. We need a neutral global currency not controlled by any one government.
Bitcoin will be the one global store of value used as money, all other cryptos will be pay-per-use, where if you want to use an ethereum dapp your smart wallet atomically swaps into eth by the second to pay for it.
It is fine to have one global currency when that currency is not forced on the world but is instead voluntarily adopted.

Wow, you put a lot of work into that statement. Impressive.
Question: have you ever heard of layer 2 off chain transactions. Aka, lightning network. You should read up on it, I hear its great stuff.
The current level of transactions we do daily now is enough if bitcoin is the settlement layer where each bitcoin transaction proxies for tens of thousands of lightning network transactions.
The network is secure enough today, mining does not need to grow. All that will happen is settlement transaction fees will get more expensive as the block rewards falls. This substitutes the current block reward all while bitcoin transactions scale infinitely using smart contract payment channels on a layer above the core protocol.
Its not rocket science.
Actually I think it may even be live now running and facilitating instant fee free transactions. Who would have guessed it. Amirite?

Not necessarily. If your product gets cheaper its because prices of all goods and services are falling which reduces your cost basis. Infact its the reduction in cost basis of core materials which causes end user product prices to be reduced by way of business competition. If core material costs were lower but you didnt reduce the price of your product a competitor will and in the process take your customers.
So all prices fall including your products price and wages stay the same, yet your percentage profit margin remains the same so you are unaffected as a business owner.
Business owners dont care what price their product sells for, they care about their percentage profit margin.
When you start a business you base everything on profit margin. A business is considered profitable or not based entirely on profit margin.
But lower prices actually fuel consumption, back to my point about people shopping for sales and spending more when things are on sale.
So if prices fall yet profit margins stay the same, that means no layoffs and no economic consequence. In that scenario employees are recieving the same salary yet their salary now buys more because prices fell which in turn fuels consumption. The end result being the business maintains constant percentage profit margins while volume of sales increase due to the positive wealth effect caused by employees salaries staying constant yet purchasing more goods.
Therfore falling prices are not bad for an economy. The only thing bad for an economy is contracting credit or in other words monetary deflation which again is a phenomenon that can only occur under a system where money is created as debt and the total stock of money declines if debt is paid off. Monetary deflation can not occur under a system of asset based money.
Now this is where it would come in really handy if economists left the acedemic world and actually spent 5 years running a business as it would help them understand the fact business does not care about price, business cares about percentage profit margin of the product they sell.

"Fiat represents the highest achievement in money".
Your are joking right. Tell that to any country in Africa, Eastern europe, south east asia or south america. Literally 80% of the planet know fiat is the root of their economic problems.
You sir live in a bubble separated from reality because your countries experience with fiat has so far not failed. The funny thing is if you are advocating unlimited government debt then it will fail in front of your eyes.
Fiat is fine, as long as all governments globally do not abuse the system. 
In that sense fiat has worked well in a few countries around the world but not in a majority of them so it cannot be called a success by any stretch of the imagination. Fiat can only work if ALL governments do not abuse the power allotted to them. Its not a success if 20% of the world benefit from the good side fiat while 80% suffer the worst outcome of fiat.
Bitcoin removes the abuse, its really that simple. Bitcoin is an option for the 80% of the world that suffer under this system, allowing them freedom of choice to escape that abuse.
You cant call fiat a success if it only works well in 20% of cases. That would be like saying cough medicine is a success if it cures 20% of patients while simultaneously killing 80% of them prematurely.
Also gold did not fail because of its scarcity. The only time scarcity was a problem was when trying to fight a war started by a country that could inflate their money supply. In that sense a global bitcoin standard that cant be gamed would dramatically reduce the duration and severeity of war.
Gold failed because it was not divisible, leading to the monetization of bimetalic systems utilizing silver and paper backed by gold. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.

Nope. Annual raises are demanded when businesses grow due to competition between companies. No business at all is forced to increase wages based on inflation. 
If a business is not growing it can not give wage increases unless those increases come from profit. Every business has a minimum operating profit it needs to achieve so if you mandate or legislate wage increases then businesses that cant meet that increase without maintaining sufficient operating profit because of low growth will fire employees to be able to afford those wage increases or worse they may shut down because they are no longer profitable.
Inflation has nothing to do with wage increases. Economic growth does. Therefore the main driver of wage growth is GDP not inflation. Stagflation is an economic state defined by low or no growth and high inflation. In that scenario wages stagnate while inflation rises. This was what the world looked like in the 1970s and we are heading towards that scenario again now, even Alan Greenspan believes this.
If the company you work for isnt growing and isnt giving wage increases then yes you should search for a new job in a company that is growing, but when the economy overall is not growing (low GDP) or in a recession, then no businesses are offering wage increases so you have no better job offers to move to.
Annual raises are the standard in a growing economy but they are not the standard in a low growth economy. If you mix a low growth economy with inflation you get a rising cost of living with no wage increases. Aka stagflation.

I am blocksize agnostic.. i dont care if we get there by raising the blocksize or by off chain scaling or both.. the most important part that people need to understand is going through periods where transactions dont confirm is unacceptable.. my bank wire takes time but atleast i know it will arrive and the bank will take care of it and i can finish the transaction. But when transactions dont confirm i sit there for hours stressing if the transaction will confirm or not or be dropped from the mempool and then im back where i started and have to try it all over again. At that point banks are better than bitcoin and that is not how it should be!
We all want scaling its just that big blockers dont want to see the network siezed up ever and small blockers dont mind if shit doesnt work temporarily.. 
What if we are back in this situation in 5 years when sooo many more businesses and apps depend on on-chain transactions confirming.. at that point it is absolutely unacceptable to have periods of time where the whole network siezes up!
So why not put a measure in place now that prevents that from ever happening.
A blocksize that retargets every 6 months based the average size of blocks over the last 6 months.
This allows the limit to be raised when there are issues with off chain scaling and allows the limit to reduce massively once there are scaling solutions.. it will do this over and over throughout time as the network scales (we will never be finished scaling just like the internet will never finish scaling). Yes it will put a TEMPORARY slight burden on nodes if it has to increase slightly but that will resolve once scaling solutions are implemented. And in the meantime the network never shits itself. Btw this also allows for a healthy fee market to evolve (the fee will average out to a few cents per transaction but in 20 years there will be 1000 txns per second which = $30,000 per block which is 3 times more than they recieve per block today! which is more than enough to incentivize miners.

This would be true if the dollar price of bitcoin was static, but it isn't. If the dollar price was static then yes each halving would be less significant than the last, but the dollar price increases thousands of percent between halvings making the dollar value of the halved supply the more significant metric to watch.

For gold to hit $5,000 it needs to add an additional $30 Trillion to its market cap.
For Bitcoin to hit $50,000 it needs to add an additional $800 Billion to its market cap.
That a difference of 150x in additional market cap between Gold and Bitcoin.
In other words, if just 3% of the money Peter thinks will flow into Gold ends up in Bitcoin instead then Bitcoin will easily surpass $50,000.
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:44:03
You misunderstand the connection.
Buying bitcoin is insurance on your existing dollars if bitcoin ends up dominating global money markets. Because bitcoin working assumes the dollars value falling.
If bitcoin doesnt work it will go to zero and your dollars will be safe.
If you are someone with $100,000 in the bank and you buy $150 worth of bitcoin today, whether bitcoin works or fails you will still have a form of money that can purchase $100,000 worth of goods and services in the future.
This is of course unless both bitcoin and the dollar die and dissapear. Then you should have bought gold haha
I really dont know how much more simple I can break it down for you to understand.
If you own bitcoin now and in the future bitcoin becomes the global standard of money you will be unaffected personally from the transition.
Thats the best I can do, take it or leave it.

Over the last decade record low interest rates globally have killed banks profit margins forcing them to make up for it by increasing the number of loans. Quantity over quality. In other words banks have taken on massive amounts of "loose lending standard" loans to prop up their profitability leaving them extremely vulnerable to a downturn that will affect the underlying collateral of those loans (mainly realestate). 
A true global recession would dessimate half of the worlds big banks.

No, if my salary doesnt increase thats normal as businesses are not required to increase my salary based on inflation, they increase my salary if their profit margins grow so as to keep me as an employee instead of me finding another job that pays more for the same role.
In a world with zero inflation the value of money rises as GDP grows, this is reflected in lower overall prices of goods and services in an economy. When the price of goods and services decline that increases the profit margin of a company as their costs are reduced, then instead of giving wage rises they lower the cost of the goods or services they sell.
In this environment my salary remains the same while cost of living falls and while the percentage profit margin of a business remains the same.
In this sense a world in which there is no inflation is better for everyone. A world in which there is inflation hurts the workers.
You asked why inflation matters.  This is why.

Saying bitcoin wont work as a store of value because its volatile is like going back to 1995 and saying the internet wont work because netflix cant run on it yet. Stability comes with time and maturity, no one in their right mind can possibly believe volatility like this will last forever.
Volatility is the only way bitcoin can go from zero to enough liquidity to be the worlds largest store of value. Bitcoin needs volatility to grow there is no other way.
Its a chicken and egg problem, which comes first stability or liquidity. The truth is it is already good enough for millions of people to use it as a store of value and as it grows volatility reduces allowing it to become more appealing to more people.
Also to add to this Rare Art, Gold and Realestate are all volatile. Gold has crashed 60% and Realestate tanked both within the last decade. When you buy a work of art you dont even know if there will be a buyer at all when you go to sell. Plus who wants to be stable against a fiat currency thats falling in value. Bitcoin rises against fiat which is more stable against other assets precisely because of fiat currency inflation. The goal is not to be stable against the dollar at all.

The average person looks at bitcoin and sees no adoption, at the same time they think if its anything to be taken seriously it should have already had way more adoption by this point. This is because they way we think technology should grow is different than it does. We think in terms of straight lines when infact a new technology grows slowly at first and then all at once in the form of an S curve.
Right now where the average person thinks bitcoin should be is far beyond where it actually is, this is because bitcoin is yet to see the parabolic S curve of growth take hold. But all of a sudden one day soon the adoption of bitcoin will appear well beyond what the average person thinks it should be. That is mainstreaming. That is the point the average person realises its here to stay and it will change the world. That is coming within the next few years IMO.

Right now at $8,000 per coin there is $100,800,000.00 per week being supplied to the market. This is how much demand there is. $100 million dollars per week. 
If demand drops price drops to reflect less demand. Like wise if supply drops price has to increase to keep absorbing this $100 million dollar weekly demand.
If demand remains the same yet supply is cut in half price will adjust higher to reflect this. This is basic supply and demand economics, the most basic of concepts.
The supply shock is always 50% each and every halving. Think about the supply shock in terms of dollars not bitcoin. Right now supply will reduce by $50 million per week. During the 2016 halving the supply reduced by $8,190,000 per week. During the 2012 halving the supply reduced by $315,000 per week.
So this would make the next halving the most dramatic so far not when measured in bitcoin but when measured in dollars.
Stop conflating supply and stock.

Yes America taxes their non-resident citizens even if they are abroad. You are talking about Americans living abroad. Im talking about citizens living in their home countries yet still being taxed on their world wide income.
Around the world it is the norm to tax citizens on income sourced world wide. Otherwise everyone would just invest in a singapore based wealth management firm and pay zero taxes on all their income. It doesnt work like that.
The point is if you hold assets in other countries and derive income from them you are still taxed on that income in your home country. This is the case in all countries with income tax and cgt.
You cant just go on a holiday to a tax free country and think your personal taxes no longer apply and you cant just hold your assets in a tax free country and think your personal taxes no longer apply. Thats not how the tax system works.
The only way to legally not pay taxes is to first of all not be an American, if your American you would still be taxed even if you lived on Mars. Second of all you would need to move and relocate permanently to a tax free country and stay for atleast a few years before the IRS believes you actually live abroad permanently now and it wasnt just a long holiday.

I need to help point out one thing though. The difference between buying at $1k and $4k is insanely huge.
Say you have $1000 to invest. 
$1k btc price, investing $1k = 1 full btc. 
$4k btc price, investing $1k = 0.25btc
If the price hits $100k in the future then owning 1 bitcoin gives you $100k, but owning 0.25 only gives you $25k. A difference/loss of $75,000.
If the price hits $1mm in the future then owning 1 bitcoin gives you $1mill, but owning 0.25 only gives you $250k. A difference/loss of $750,000.
Basically buying at $4k instead of $1k means you lose 75% of all future profits.

For now if the dollar does not experience high levels if inflation, yes, bitcoin will become more stable priced in dollars. Volatility has been dropping since bitcoins inception and this will continue.
If the dollar is experiencing high levels of inflation that means the bitcoin price would also be rising dramatically. Just like gold and other commodities during periods of high inflation. 
My guess is bitcoin becomes more stable until the dollar sees high levels of inflation at which point bitcoin will rise in terms of infalting dollars. You have to realise that during this time of high USD inflation bitcoin will buy the same amount of goods and services even while its dollar price is rising. So it will look like the price of everything (including bitcoin) is rising, but whats really happening is bitcoin staying stable against other goods in society while the dollar is falling. At that point you would be stupid to not use bitcoin. Just ask venezuelans currently.
All goods in society are valued relative to eachother, supply and demand. Inflation is not prices going up, its the dollar going down.

Bitcoin millionaire would mean you own &gt; 1 million bitcoins. Just as a dollar millionaire owns &gt; 1 million dollars.
They are technically a dollar millionaire.
We need to find the number of bitcoins that would put you in the top 0.1% of the population and work off of that. 
For example, for now, when it comes to talking about bitcoin, a hundredaire is very close to a dollar millionaire.
Maybe soon a tenaire will be considered as wealthy as a dollar millionaire. 
If somehow we reach 1 million dollars per bitcoin then the simple term "bitcoinaire" will be the benchmark for wealth. Because you cant be a bitcoinaire without atleast one full bitcoin, and thats already out of reach for 99% of the worlds population.

BTC supply = 16.68 Million
BCH supply = 16.80 Million
Since the fork (lets say 2 months) BCH has 0.8% (almost 1%) more currency units issued than BTC. 
Seems small but if this continues then the cap of 21 million units will be reached by BCH in as little as 10 years from now. Let that sink in. Where will mining rewards come from after that with no fees.
100 ÷ 0.8 = 125

Alot of new institutional investors betting that the price will be higher psychologically pushes the actual price higher. Mainly through arbitrage. You can still arbitrage the actual price and the future price.
Also futures are a great way for all bitcoin businesses to elimate bitcoins volatility from their business model.
A service like bitpay can now easily have a sound business model without risk of losing money when the value of the btc they are holding drops. However this also sees them losing out on gains when the price rises. But their business model is not investing, its fees. So this is an amazing option for all businesses that deal in bitcoin. Just like futures are great for all businesses that deal in corn or oil or wheat or pork bellies or anything else listed as a future on the CME.

So you see technology driven efficiency gains offsetting any and all inflationary pressure.
This is where we disagree. Not everything in the CPI is massively impacted by efficiency gains and technology. For example we are coming out of a commodity bear market and into a commodity bull market meaning argricultural goods and building materials are about to become more expensive.
Fiat money creation is on steroids currently since 2008.
The only way efficiency gains can outpace inflation is if right now the cost of production falls off a cliff. Which I dont see happening within the next 2 years.

Base money inflation is off the charts so technically speaking inflation is doing just fine. What central banks are having trouble with is velocity of money AKA consumer spending.
Think of this analogy. Your in a shower and the water is cold (no consumer spending / deflating asset prices) so you turn up the hot water tap (money printing), still no hot water so you turn it up more, still no hot water so you turn it up even more (QE1, QE2, QE3) then all of a sudden the water is boiling and you burn yourself (inflation). Inflation has then taken hold and its too late to turn it off.
The day will come soon when central bankers burn themselves.

Why would it be close to instantaneous? Miners recieve less btc, over time the OTC markets run dry as less btc is being sold through them, once OTC markets run dry buyers have no choice but to go to the spot market to buy, as big buyers slowly move from the OTC market to the spot market it starts to affect the price more directly, this price change brings in more media interest and increased demand creating a wave of hype and retail demand.
You think the change in demand is separate from the effects of the halving? Its not. Reduced supply increases demand. Demand is higher for scarcer objects than it is for abundant objects so if you have a supply shock which makes an object scarcer it not only reduces supply but it also increases demand at the same time as it makes the object more desireable. The price rises that are due to increased demand are triggered by the halving and the effects that reduced supply has on market psychology.

Each transaction is made up of a certain amount of data on average 250 bytes per transaction. Each 10 minute block can currently contain 1mb of data. It is limited to 1mb to prevent the size of the blockchain ballooning and becoming difficult to store and propogate. This would have the long term consequence of only a handful of large corporations having the resources to store and propogate the blockchain leaving them controlling and monitoring all transactions taking away bitcoins censorship resistance and decentalisation (20 years away).
At present this is the number of transactions the blockchain can accommodate per second.
Note that because of the limit a "fee" market has developed where in people try to out bid eachother to try and get their transaction in the next block. This is because miners (transaction processors) automatically include the highest paying trasactions first to boost their profit margin.
There are 2 scaling solutions. 
1) Just raise the 10 minute block size limit, risking decentralisation for higher throughput, which is what the bitcoin cash clone of bitcoin has done. This is a short term fix with real long term consequences.
2) build out second layer solutions like payment channels also known as Lightning Network. This allows an infinite amount of secure transactions to take place but with only the final settlement being recorded on the blockchain. This is a long term fix but has short term consequences in the form of limited transaction throughput until the tech is ready.
Here is another article that sums it up nicely.

In 140 years from when we no longer rely on the block reward and bitcoin has global adoption the idea is that billions of people and software agents will be using bitcoin meaning even at a 1 cent tx fee there will be more than the block reward in fees for miners.
However it is a much better approach to make 90% of all transactions instant and free off chain while keeping the important settlement transactions on chain with higher fees.

No one needs to know about the halving for it to happen. The effects of the halving happen whether people know why, how, when or not. Supply reduces regardless of how many people know about it. The laws of economics and market psychology work no matter how many people know exactly how many new bitcoin are being mined every 10 minutes.
You dont need to know how gravity works to feel its effects.
You dont need to know how many ounces of gold are mined per day to calculate its price. Its price is what it is on the open market based on supply and demand. Markets are amazing things. Even if the halving event was an algorithmic secret and completely unknown the effects of it would still happen.

Scarcity creates demand. The more scarce something is the more valuable it becomes, the more valuable something is the more people desire it.
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:42:32
Yes thats true but they dont see it. 
The other reason they have for not wanting to adopt segwit and lightning is because of this:
There is a blockchain startup called blockstream dedicating themselves to make sidechains a reality, an insurance company called axa invested in blockstream to gain insight and exposure into the blockchain space to help them understand the technology. blockstream, with its ambition of making sidechains a reality also employs like 3 or 4 devs that are so smart that they have successfully contributed to bitcoins core code.
All of this is very natural and healthy for bitcoin. There is nothing sinister about it. But for these anti-segwit guys it somehow translates into "the core team being owned by banks" and therefore every idea from core now must be to benefit banks.
Yes its highly short sighted and ignorant but that is their reasoning.

It is scarcity plus utility that create value and therefore demand. Something can be scarce and have no value if it is useless, converesly something can be useful but if it is also abdunant it has no value.
Bitcoin has both scarcity and utility. Increasing either scarcity or utility adds value.

If there is that much demand for ammo to cause a price increase of 3000x as you state, then people will make more ammo as its such a profitable business keeping prices in equalibrium (basic supply and demand).

Throughout history every time a new form of money arose within a society and that new form of money was harder to produce than the previous form of money it grew to dominate. 
If bitcoin doesnt go away and continues doing what it has been doing the last 9 years it will grow to dominate simply because those that use the easier to produce money will loose purchasing power over time and those that use the new harder to produce form of money will not.
Bitcoin new supply issuance rate is already below that of the strongest global currencies like the dollar euro and yen. And in a couple of short years from now will be below that of gold.
This is why I beleive bitcoin will either die or grow to dominate the global money market.
Agree or disagree with this idea, but that doesnt change the fact the only way to undermine bitcoins growth trajectory would be for governments to institute the same monetary principles as bitcoin, and that is not possible today because if governments did that a deflationary crash would ensue causing another global great depression.
A system created out of debt needs ever increasing debt to function (fiat). Unlike gold or bitcoin.

The funny thing is if all transactions are taking place in bitcoin without the need to cash out to fiat, the government will have no choice but to accept income tax and sales tax to be paid to them in bitcoin.
So you will get paid in bitcoin and give 20% of that bitcoin to the tax authority. Or you will buy a TV and the merchant will give 10% of that sale to the government in bitcoin.
The government will then use that bitcoin to pay our private sector citizens for what we vote for it to pay for. For example roads, sanitation, defence etc.

Wait. So if the interest rate is "deeply" negative then I can go to the bank and take out a loan and the bank will pay me interest instead of me paying the bank interest.. seriously.
That will cause prices of everything on earth to hyperinflate because everyone will just be living off of unlimited debt meaning no cieling to what people can pay for things.
How can the population still take these people seriously..
If this happens during the next recession bitcoin will go balistic. People will stop keeping any money in the bank. If they cant withdraw cash they will just buy anything they can, from gold coins to furniture to cars to bitcoin. The only money left in banks will be one week worth of wages..

Yes, market adoption means its beneficial for the buyers. Bitcoin needs mass adoption to destabilize the old system of money meaning also that it will only destabilize the old system if it is mass adopted over time, and if it is mass adopted before the old system collapses then it is by definition a net positive and most likely a slow smooth transition.
If however the old system collapses before bitcoin is mass adopted then that would mean the old system collapsed suddenly under its own weight of unsustainable debt. In which case thank god we have bitcoin as a functioning alternative so we dont end up back in the stone age.

Agreed; During the coming global economic meltdown, both gold and bitcoin will skyrocket and then both will correct 50% or so (ending up settling at a price much much higher than today).
Then over the proceeding 10 years or so i believe you will see value slowly leak from gold and into bitcoin as the inevitable happens and blockchain finance takes over.

For me past charts and patterns are meaningless and should never be used to try and predict the future.. however.. the halving is something we know about the future with certainty that will not change. So to see potentially both bottoms happen exactly 18 months before the halving supply reduction is the best argument I have seen yet for the bottom being in.
After all, all prices are a function of supply and demand and if supply is transparently known and predictable in advance it can then be used as the most solid metric to predict the future in terms of time (not price). In other words using the halving schedule to predict the timing of the bottom of a cycle is the most reliable form of TA we have so far, because it relies on known protocol level facts rather than charting assumptions.

Historically demand for alternative currencies increases during times of severe economic issues because of inflation risk, soverign debt risk and currency risk, and historically during times of war demand for gold increases due to its indestructible nature and lack of need for 3rd parties along with other reasons similar to economic issues like currency risk and soverign debt risk as war tends to breed economic issues also.
The scenario where demand for gold and bitcoin fall would be in a shallow recession that exhibits no currency risk, no banking crisis, no soverign debt risk and no inflation risk. However most people in the bitcoin space see possibly the worst recession since the great depression coming. For the world to get so bad that no one cares about gold or bitcoin it would have to revert to a state where no humans wanted to perform economic activity at all, no one wanted to trade anything. A zombie apocalypse might cause that (maybe), but even in the depths of war humans need to trade with eachother for goods and services and barter does not work so a monetary medium will exist out of necessity.

Paper wallet is only viable for very long term cold storage where you do not plan on moving the funds at all for a long period of time.
Hardware wallet gives you the same level of security as a paper wallet yet allows you to transfer and recieve funds on a regular basis.
Simply depends what suits you.
If you have a large amount of btc a hardware wallet is usually the better option.
I myself have a ledger nano s for travelling and a ledger blue to keep at home in my office (both running the exact same wallet / same seed). My recovery phrase is kept in a private vault safe deposit box where only I have access, but should something happen to me my family will gain access to the safe deposit box and recovery seed which they know how to use.

So brand new projects in this space still running their ICO have time to make high quality, descriptive and informative mini docos, but the most important and most well funded dev teams does not.
These devs cant take 10 minutes of their day (even on skype) to answer a few questions and pay a few thousand dollars to an online contractor to put together a short mini doco mainly displaying graphics. 
Solution: why dont they start a multisig contract with the community. We donate to it and fund these mini docos to inform the community in depth of upcoming events and protocol upgrades.

This is interesting. Not yet anything to do with bitcoin but shows us a glimpse of the future.
What happens when the amount of liquidity in bitcoin is so large and a majority of their country have adopted bitcoin (including getting paid in bitcoin and paying taxes in bitcoin) that a government borrowing bitcoin from the global market to fund projects beyond taxes then becomes a reality.
In a world where your citizens accept bitcoin and pay taxes in bitcoin leaves a government unable to fund deficits with fiat. They no longer have a currency they can print so the ONLY way for them to spend more than they tax would be to issue bitcoin denominated soverign bonds effectively borrowing bitcoin from the rest of the world.
The strongest economies would attract the lowest interest rates making fiscal and economic responsibility a must if you want to borrow bitcoin from the market. No one is going to loan their bitcoin to a government who doesnt know how to manage their economy.
There is most likely a few governments now somewhere using their paper money to buy some bitcoin for their reserves just incase it keeps growing and becomes the new global standard. That government will become very wealthy compared to other governments that continue to ignore bitcoin.

The reason for bitcoin is to give the world a form of money that cant be inflated away by unelected central bankers. This is needed more in corrupt countries than in developed countries.
The reason to avoid a central authority is to eliminate that corruptable power source so as to ensure corruption can never re-emerge. Also having no central authority means there is no point that can be used to shut bitcoin down.
In other words the elimination of a central authority is required to give the world a corruption free alternative monetary system.
Also if you think central authority is a good thing then you are likely not from one of the corrupt countries where the other 6 billion people live.

This. There will be interconnected LN hubs all over the world, one day possibly as many as the number of full nodes that exist today in bitcoin.
Also this will only be one scaling solution out of many. There will be sidechains, and sprite networks, and many other layer 2 technologies all working together to deliver the possibility of billions of transactions per second, in a way that is just as secure as recording your transaction on the blockchain itself.
If you want convenience you use one type of wallet that uses layer 2 technologies. If want a record on the blockchain you use a wallet that records your transaction on the blockchain. Most wallets will end up offering both. Pay a fee and wait 10 mins to record your transaction forever on the blockchain or opt for a free instant transaction.
This is how bitcoin will evolve and it is alot more efficient and user friendly than trying to do everything on chain.

Look at 
There will exist a decentralised platform. From a depositors perspective you deposit btc and recieve interest, that btc is then lent out to 1000 different people requesting loans minimizing your risk of losses, reputation system will keep people honest and block non compliant users.
From a loaners perspective their loan request is funded by 1000 different people and their interest payments go back to funding the interest owed to the depositors.
No central 3rd parties. The platform will run on reputation systems and smart contract escrow. The interest rate will be determined by free market supply and demand. More demand for loans = higher interest rate, less demand for loans = lower interest rate. 
This platform will act as a global source of loans for reputable individuals. And act as a source of interest payments for people willing to put their money on the platform. Remember the platform is decentralised, run on smart contracts and escrow so there is zero risk of the creator of the platform running off with the deposits.

Last time I checked making drugs illegal drove drug usage higher and prices of drugs went through the roof. Same with alcohol prohibition.
Making bitcoin illegal will do nothing but promote the reasons it exists in the first place and drive people to it more than ever, not to mention causing a premium for it to develop..
The more corrupt the country the more making it illegal will drive adoption. Financial incentives that  mean the difference between the survival or demise of your family and children far outway any politically draconian law.
Bitcoin has been anticipating this war since its inception, it was designed to fight this war, and win.
Also, within the next decade it will become crystal clear to the world that banning bitcoin would be as self destructive to an economy as banning the internet. History is a good teacher of this lesson, in the age of the classical gold standard countries that adopted the gold standard flourished and those that did not fell into ruin constantly plundered by those who held gold.
China already know banning it doesnt work, they have tried many times, so now they move to try and stop the network itself from functioning by banning mining, as if all the mining is in china. This also will not work. 
And finally and possibly most importantly. If bitcoin didnt matter there would be no need to ban it as no one would use it. The mere fact people want to ban it means it matters, and if it matters to even a minority of the global population it has already won.

This way we dont have to get confused building a new one. Just run the script and it will build automatically over time.

By the year after the halving in 2024 all the mainsteam acceptance will already have taken place.
My point is mainstream acceptance will be complete by 2024, not starting in 2024. Which means three hundred million people will adopt bitcoin over 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
So the 2020 halving will be far more relevant than the 2024 halving, because by 2024 a large part of that 400 million users required to make bitcoin mainstream will already own bitcoin.

If they announced it publicy that they were involved it would bring more legitimacy and cause a price rise.
They dont want the price to rise until after they have finished accumulating.
Also bitcoin still has a negative stigma surrounding it and they dont want to have to explain themselves to misinformed ignorant people.
Once bitcoin has been accepted by the mainstream and has little gains left to be had you will start to hear all of the smartest people in the world say that they actually invested ages ago.

Bitcoin has (for all intents and purposes) ruled out technical failure after having proven itself for a decade, so is unlikely to fail technically, and wont fail so long as there is demand.
The only way to kill demand would be to make its usecases irrellevant. Namely its sound immutable monetary policy and its censorship resistance. 
So the biggest threat to bitcoin today would be if all central banks returned to the gold standard simultaneously and all commercial banks gave their customers complete privacy and soverignty over their accounts. That would drastically undermine demand for bitcoin.
But how likely is that really...

In any case, I am not from the US so bullets are very low on my list of serious investments, maybe im not the best person to be trying to preach this stuff to.
But your argument is basically saying human society will just ignore the concept of money entirely. That will not happen, even in armageddon style circumstances people will still find a way to trade, and not every mother and child wants bullets as a form of money.
Look at history atleast, WW2 was the closet thing to armageddon human civilization has ever experienced. And Gold did extremely well. People still found a way to trade.

So Roger thinks game theory economics (trying to make the product your mining worth more) automatically makes miners honest, without a doubt. He is so confident in his argument.
How about, people have short term mindsets. Making them chase the largest amount of money they can short term. Short term greed more often than not outweighs long term gain for most people.
So roger is basically saying miners could never succumb to short term greed. WTF
This guy gets an idea in his head, thinks he is so smart therefore it MUST be true, then blindly preaches his argument while completely ignoring other points of view.
After screaming that miners are all trustworthy because they want bitcoin to be worth more, a few weeks later its revealed Bitmain and Antpool are cheating the network for short term greed at the expense of the long term benefit of the network.

Rogers arguments will consist of the following.
1) Miners want the price of btc to go higher therefore they are completely honest (ignoring the "human nature" phenomenon of short term thinking and greed) resulting in doing anything for short term gains at the expense of the long term health of the protocol.
2) He owns ALOT of bitcoin and was in this space SOOO early (bragging/praising himself) therefore he knows whats best and you should blindly trust him even though his understanding of technicalities is almost zero.
3) If you try to talk about technical specifics that he doesnt understand he will cut you off and yell "satoshi nakamoto" 3 times fast.

For the people still unsure what this means..
"In game theory, a focal point (also called Schelling point) is a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them."
In other words bitcoin is the default go-to cryptocurreny, this displays its superior network effect and taking that into account shows us that in order for another cryptocurrency to unseat this network effect it must be atleast an order of magnitude (10x) better than bitcoin on many if not all fronts. Mere superficial upgrades or tweaks are not enough to unseat bitcoin.

Your missing one dynamic. A free market interest rate. 
Interest rates (the price of money) are supposed to be determined by supply and demand of capital like all other prices. When the supply of capital (savings) is high interest rates fall incentivising people to borrow. When the supply of savings is low interest rates rise incentivising people to save.
So high savings leads to low interest rates which leads to larger amounts of borrowing to invest which matches the high consumer demand evidenced by high savings rates. And low savings leads to high interest rates which leads to smaller amounts of borrowing to invest which matches the low consumer demand evidenced by low savings rates.
This works because the worst possible thing you can do as a business is take on debt and invest in expansion when demand is not really there. So this balance stops people from over investing when savings are low (because low savings mean low consumer demand) and incentivises debt and investment when savings are high (because high savings mean high consumer demand). This mechanism prevents large booms and large busts and allows slow and steady natural growth.
However, we now have a situation where debt is being incentivised while demand is low so we need to artificially create demand too, leading people to falsely conclude that a lack of consumption is the problem, or that somehow consumption is what is needed and is therefore what drives the economy when it couldnt be further from the truth. Following this logic we end up in a place where max consumption and max debt go on until the unsustainability of it causes the system to collapse under its own weight in the form of a debt crisis. Consumption follows growth it does not lead it. Growth comes from investment and expansion which itself comes from excess savings because excess savings signal high demand and lower interest rates.
A free market interest rate mechanism is what prevents booms and their subsequent busts, it stops things overheating in the first place as high interest rates caused by low savings prevent over investment and over borrowing. Under a free market interest rate the rate of interest swings healthily minimally and naturally. Under manipulated interest rates the interest rate falls and rises over the decades yet always at lower lows and lower highs all the way down to negative.
It is the manipulation of interest rates by central banks which causes booms because they keep the rate unnaturally low, and then when the bust inevitably occurs they manipulate rates even more to try and prevent it. This manipulation results in worse and worse crises everytime with the predictable final outcome of negative rates and ultimately global systemic soverign debt crises.
This is precisley why bitcoin was invented in the first place. To offer an alternative to the chicanery I just described above.
TLDR; the problem is not lack of demand or lack of consumption. The problem is far deeper than that and goes all the way back to the architecture of our monetary system and the way interest rates work.

Yet, the higher the spread gets the less likely people are to withdraw their btc, they would rather wait for a dip to offset losses, which is keeping the spread in check at around $80 on average. 
I highly doubt bitfinex will collapse. A more logical outcome is people stop depositing fiat and the spread simply remains at $80 until bitfinex secures new channels for people to deposit and withdraw fiat. Also note only US correspondant banks are causing this issue meaning hong kong locals using this exchange can still withdraw hong kong dollars.
A $65mm hack didnt collapse this exchange, this situation wont either IMO. It is a temporary set back but will get sorted out. If they can solve this issue they will gain even more confidence from their depositors IMO.

Money is a measuring tool. It measures value accross an ecomomy.
Why would we use a measuring tool that is always changing instead of a measuring tool that is static. Obviously a static measurement that doesnt change is beneficial, it allows certainty when building your future.
Soon instead of measuring bitcoin in dollars all fiat currencies will be measured against a unit of bitcoin.
Bitcoin will be the standard to achieve stability against just like today the USD is the standard to achieve stability with. Soon if your monetary policy makes your currency fall against bitcoin you will not be considered a legitimate government.
It will be the job of global governments to try and achieve stability with bitcoin for if they do not people will dump their fiat currency and buy btc just like today they dump weaker currencies and buy dollars. Right now we are trying to create stable coins when in the near future governments will be trying to make their fiat currencies stable against bitcoin or risk a currency crisis and soverign debt crisis.

The last 3 years bitcoin was mostly ignored and passed off as dead by the mainstream. Now its everywhere and this bull run has been ongoing without a substantial crash for 12 months which is unheard of for bitcoin. This is where the mainstream have a chance to hear about it, learn about it, and then buy it all at once because a crashing price is not putting them off for the first time ever. 
The conatant exposure and rising price over the last 12 months is whats giving the mainstream confidence to finally come out if the wood work.
In all bull markets this is synonymous with the very begining of the public phase which leads into a blow off top. That is what will eventuate over the next 3 years IMO.
We might see constantly rising prices for the next 3 years until bitcoin is extremely overvalued and then a final crash and subsequent long term stability for bitcoin (at prices alot higher than today).
Its not impossible for prices to start getting out of hand and hit $1 million followed by a crash to $100,000 and stability at that level for a decade.
IMO most of the gains will happen over the next 3 years followed by a crash and stability which then allows bitcoin to be used as a stable currency and unit of account.

Money to a certain extent, safe haven to a certain extent, stock issuance to a certain extent, global title registration to a certain extent, global audit trails to a certain extent, autonomous machine to machine payments to a certain extent, global identity to a certain extent. Now take 20% of all those industries. Then 5% of that 20% is what bitcoin can disrupt within 20 years. 
Gold = 8 trillion
Broad money stock = 80 trillion
Title registration industry = ?
Notary industry = ?
Lets call it 100 trillion all up.
20% of 100 trillion is 20 trillion, 5% of 20 trillion is 1 trillion. If bitcoin maintains a 50% crypto currency market share of 1 trillion then the price should be 500 billion divided by 16 million bitcoins is $30,000 per bitcoin. So at an extremely conservative low end valuation $30,000 bitcoin is possible. 
But whos to say bitcoins market cap should only be worth 1/16th of golds, alot of people would argue that bitcoin should hypothetically be worth more than gold because it is so much more than just a store of value.
Who knows what the market for autonomous machine to machine payments will be worth? That could be a multi trillion dollar market alone created entirely by robots and software agents.
Trying this in any form is flawed.
Just like this attempt all you will find out there is a conservative estimate of $50,000 to $100,000 and a not so conservative estimate of $500,000 to $1 million.
I think a better way to do it is to say 1 bitcoin will always be worth 1 bitcoin. Now considering 1 bitcoin will eventually become an extremely rare thing to own (not even all millionaires today could ever possibly own 1 bitcoin because there are more millionaires than full bitcoins in existance) what is 1 bitcoin worth to an individual. For me, understanding how rare 1 bitcoin will be I wouldnt trade 1 bitcoin for less than something extremely valuable to me. For example a house. That alone puts the price of 1 bitcoin for me in the range of $500,000. If enough people adopt this mindset due to the scarcity value of 1 bitcoin then bitcoin will only be sold in large amounts as the price increases. Which distributes the currency over even more hands who end up with the same mindset. And we end up with a free market valuation where subjective value determines the price of bitcoin. Or in other words 1 bitcoin will have to be valued above what the majority deem it worth for people to trade it for a good or service, which leaves us at a stable price that the wole world agrees this is worth to them.

I agree. My point is there is no way to avoid that.
When oil was discovered it was similarly extremely volatile in its valuation for a long time until our global society discovered its societal value.
Bitcoin will be volatile and get ahead of itself along the way to the fundamental value our global society eventually places on it.
Long term fundamental growth, short term speculation. Thats the nature of any newly discovered extremely useful commodity.

Gold early adopters and whales have a disproportionate share of the gold supply. That doesnt stop it becoming a safe haven or money again.
Its a moot argument.
If the world is deciding that bitcoin is money then it is. People can complain as much as they like but that wont stop it from happening.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:52:37
The key is understanding bitcoin is global. If somehow people get duped into recieving some kind of debt based digital token from an american bank for example, then who is going to accept that for payment outside of america?
The segmented nature of banking as it stands today is exactly why it cant compete with a decentralised global financial network.

Its funny isnt it. People always directly compare the new technology to the old one. When in reality the new technology ends up evolving into something so unimaginable and transformative that the old technology looks archaic in hindsight.
The future is bright for the world of programmable truth!
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:08:39
So you admit and understand that bitcoin has value. A global system for programmbale, permissionless, immutable truth that allows global collaboration in entirely new and more efficient ways has tremendous value.
If this technology delivers on its promise the value is clearly higher than it is today. Your question is how do we know bitcoin (in its current form and amount of usage) is not overvalued short term due to speculators.
Is bitcoin in its current form worth $4,300? 
8 years after oil was discovered what was its value? 8 years after gold was discovered what was its value? 8 years after the internet was invented what its value. 
All value is subjective, see the subjective theory of value. Therefore the value of everything is set entirely by how much it is required over other goods in an economy.
All markets are short term slot machines (gambling) but long term weighing scales. This means all markets experience overvaluation and undervaluation short term. This is human nature and is unavoidable. 
Bitcoin must go though volatile price discovery, there is no other way to determine a global consensus on a free market derived valuation.
Bitcoin has a certain promise at the end of the road. And every day along the way that promise is either a tiny bit closer to being realised or a tiny bit further away depending on a million different events every day. From development progress, government regulation, hype, fear, software bugs, adoption, etc etc etc.
There is no way to know what the price of bitcoin will be every day or every year because there are a million other factors at play. The best you can do is try to think about the end result (bitcoin being used as a global platform for trust and collaboration with money just being the first of many applications of that system) and what it might be worth if we reach that outcome. 
Its zero sum. We will either reach that outcome or something else will eventually. So bitcoin will be worth alot more than it is today or nothing at all. The rest is just short term noise.
The reason it used to be $100 and is now $5000 is because the potential of that outcome being achieved is alot higher now than it was 3 years ago.
If it was obvious that that outcome was inevitable the price would be higher. If it was obvious that outcome will take alot longer to be realised then the price would be lower. But nothing in life is obvious due to a million different factors.
Is there too much optimism right now? Probably, but nothing goes up in a straight line. When oil was discovered was it $100 a barrel the next day. No because price discovery takes time. The value of oil went up and down all the way from $0 to $100 a barrel over multiple decades as more and more applications of oil became imagined and turned into reality.
It seems like your asking why is bitcoin volatile. Constant development of the platform and human nature should make that apparent.
The truth is, trying to ask what the value of bitcoin should be is like going back to when oil was discovered and saying oil should be worth X because the whale blubber industry is worth Y. Or the automobile industry should be worth X becuase all the horses in the world are worth Y. Or the internet as a % of GDP should be worth X because the value of all media companies is worth Y. Its pointless.
Bitcoin and other decentralised trust platforms are a new beast all together and will end up with their own independant valuation determined by the judgement of billions of people factoring in millions of circumstances and events some of which are unimaginable today.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:04:44
I like this.
The stupidest argument against bitcoin is "its too volatile to work". Like no shit, it is going to be volatile, there is no other way to reach price discovery in a free market. It will remain volatile until one day it isnt volatile anymore.
One thing I do like to think about is this: In the age of the internet, information at the speed of light, price discovery will take place faster than any newly discovered commodity in history. This is the first time in human history price discovery will take place on a global basis fueled by instant and free access to information. I have a stong feeling the price is only just warming up. The next 2 years will be fun for us to watch, and a nightmare to watch for people hanging onto the dream of gold.
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:29:37
No one person will set the price of bitcoin. It is driven by a free market. Not set by a government. Therefore the price is determined based on what people value it at during every single transaction that takes place between potentially billions of people. And that subjective value will change daily based on millions of other factors and events. Seems like you need to study up on how a free market operates.

They seem to think that bitcoin forking into btc and bch means more bitcoin was created?
Nothing wrong with competing currencies. Just because gold has competition in the form of silver doesnt mean it is failing, or that gold supply was magically increased.
Consensus is prone to majority vote, but for the first time in history the only way to change the rules of a currencies limited supply would be for a super majority to accept it. Not policy makers.
This is the single most distributed form of consensus for money we have ever known. That is a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:21:06
This can happen.
I go to take a btc loan from a bank, where do I recieve the money because it cant be in my wallet if its fractional reserve btc. Then what about the merchant? Would he accept money that cant be delievered as btc to his wallet?
Fractional reserve is possible with gold because people didnt want to hold gold (paper was more convienient). Fractional reserve is possible with paper because people didnt want to hold paper (bank digits were more convenient).
But what is more convenient than cryptos?
People will only accept real btc for payment so no banks will be able to lend fake fractional reserve btc.
Banks might become storage facilities for crypto for the masses that want insurance, but they wont be able to get away with lending at fractional reserve. They will only be able to lend what they take in as deposit.
Even then there will be alot of people that trust a smart contract more than a bank. That smart contract acts as a place of deposit for p2p loans and you recieve interest that way.
This is just banks grasping at straws trying to stay relevant.

There is no way for it to be used as money without introducing trusted third parties. That was the case thousands of years ago and is even more so the case today.

Fun fact: the market cap of bitcoin today is lower than one single tech companies stock price in 1999.
If human psychology feeds this market the same as every other new market before it, then we have a long way to rise in a relatively short amount of time.
Also dont forget this market is global. You dont need a brokerage account, all you need is an app ( for example, walk into any 7/11 in any area of the Philippines, even the most provincial town where their 7/11 is the only commercially branded shop, and you can buy bitcoin instantly through an electronic kiosk).

The fact that the market cap of cryptos is tiny compared to the gold market just shows how much more upside potential cryptos have compared to gold.
If the gold bugs are right about their predictions, and 1% of the money that will come chasing gold finds its way into bitcoin instead, then bitcoin will outperform gold 5 to 1.
What if more than 1% finds its way into crypto instead of gold. Say 10%? Then bitcoin would outperform gold 50 to 1.
The risks are greater in bitcoin but so are the rewards. And that makes perfect sense.

Exactly this. Claiming bitcoin "is" a bubble is different from claiming bitcoin is experiencing a bubble like valuation short term.
Some people have been calling bitcoin a bubble since it was $10 or $100. Insinuating it will revert back to zero and completely dissapear. 
Yes bitcoin may well be currently overvalued and due for a healthy correction, but it is not going to dissapear tomorrow, even if it is globally illegal. Bitcoin grew up in the dark without a care. Why should it care now.
Heres a good thought experiment. Lets say the absolute floor on the price is when people who owned bitcoin stopped being ones who didnt care about its legal status but instead cared about its anti-authority nature, and started being people who wanted to make a quick buck. I put this moment in time at around end of 2012 start of 2013. Averaging around $75 per coin. Anything below this and your bavk to the people who just dont give a shit about legal status. But how many people will be buying up as much as possible all the way down to those levels? And im not just talking about individuals, how many governments who just banned it will be buying it up as it falls!

Bitcoins immutability is derived from the fact that to change its history you have to recalculate past proof of work. That costs money in the form of hardware and electricity. The only way to get people from all over the world to direct computational power at the bitcoin network is to incentivise them with profit. That profit comes in the form of a token. Bitcoin.
A blockchain itself can easily be altered. The same as it would be easy to alter bitcoin today if there was no substantial mining power behind it.
So a blockchain is only tamper evident, the only benefit of a blockchain over a shared database with write access is that it is alot easier to notice when it has been altered after it has been altered.
That may be ok for a private company if used internally. But when the end goal is to agree on a single source of truth to facilitate wide spread collaboration then the only system that can offer immutability is an open public blockchain with a freely traded token that is used as incentive for either proof of work security or proof of stake security.
There is currently no possible way invented to have an unalterable blockchain without a native valuable token.
You cant remove a blockchains token and expect to keep its promise of immutability.

I still recall him screaming that you should sell btc for gold at $900 because it just dropped from $1300. It then proceeded to rise by 600%.
This guy is lost. Now his feeds are full of shit about Puerto Rico's jones act crisis. Like dude your a money manager. I dont care about non-investible information. He has started losing the plot recently.
Possibly watching bitcoins rise is taking its toll on his mental health. Thats my theory anyway.

I think you miss the point. He is arguing that bitcoin is still absolutely tiny in comparison to these large tech giants. Given the things that this space makes possible it is fair to say we have a long way to go still. Or atleast the potential is there.
So, bitcoin could only be called a bubble if it had no use and was purely speculative. A decentralised programmable single source of global truth, and the worlds first digital bearer instrument has tremendous value, maybe even as much as windows and ios combined.
It all comes down to perspective. If you think bitcoin has no use case then it is in a bubble. If you understand how useful the bitcoin platform and currency are then it is no where near its true potential value.

Exactly. In any mania phase valuations go way beyond what the technology can actually do. The dot com bubble is the perfect example.
Bitcoin is overvalued compared to what it can do today but undervalued compared to what it will do in he future. 
We will see extreme overvaluation before a final crash back to reality. That extreme overvaluation will incorporate the hype of everything bitcoin can be in the future. Meaning a market cap in the 10s of trillions. Then we will crash back to reality of maybe the capabilities of one bank ($10 trillion market cap / $500,000 per coin).

What makes you think the 80% crashes of the past will continue into the future? Volatility decreasing while liquidity is increasing and adoption increasing at this level is unprecedented for bitcoin.
Yes bitcoin has always previously had a big crash after a big run up. But this is the first time a big rally has lasted longer than a few weeks. Going on 8 months now. 
Also thats not what arbitrage is.
Arbitrage is defined as simultaneous buying and selling on different markets. What your doing is called "betting" on something that has a 50/50 chance of happening.

Thats $350,000 per btc right there. Just doing what one bank does today.

The whole point of decentralised security is having millions of options to do the same thing.
If everyone stored their seed in the same manner then it would be easy to attack. 
The reason it becomes almost impossible to attack is because no one knows which of the potential millions methods of seed storage their target is using.
Is their seed on a computer? A flash drive? Where is the flash drive? Buried in the back yard? Etched into the inside of their cars door steel frame? At their relatives house? In a safe deposit box? In their memory? On their cats collar? Who the fuck knows.
Try breaking into someones house and finding a seed. It could be stuck on their fridge as part of their kids school work and you wouldnt even know it.
If your worried about a physical attack then make sure you have some sort of plausible deniability set up.
The best thing about crypto is that there are infinite ways of storing your keys or seed...
This is not a bank. There isnt one method. This is the world of decentralised money. That also means decentralised storage of money. 
Find a method that best suits your situation.

One currency is unfeasible for multiple economies when it is controlled by one governing body in brussels who manipulates the currency to set an interest rate for all economies simultaneously. The euro is unfeasible for this reason the same as the dollar is unfeasible as its fed funds rate target sets international borrowing costs and everyone wants stability against the dollar so they follow USD policy.
When the world was using the classical gold standard there was no problem like this. 
One global currency that is politically neutral where individual economies can have individual interest rates without fear of having a currency that is too strong or too weak is a beautiful thing and will lead to immense global prosperity.

That was a sucession of 3 separate runups and 80% crashes during that time with long stagnant periods in between where btc looked dead. Thats my point. The constant volatility put people off. 
This time we have just been rising for almost a year with only short term irrellevant pull backs. Once we maintain this level and trend sideways for 6 months, everyones going to think bitcoin never crashes anymore and the world will pile in taking valuations far beyond fundamentals. And by that i mean a market cap in the 10s of trillions, after all thats what it needs to be to move as much money per day as JP Morgan.
Then we will crash and stabilize for a decade.

It could easily drop back below 2k.. afterall everytime it has had a sharp rise in the past it has retraced by 70 or 80%.
But think about this. Every past sharp rise lasted maximum 1 or 2 months. This one has been ongoing now for atleast 6 months and doesnt look like stopping anytime soon. This could mean that it is the begining of the final 2 year bubble where it doesnt fall substanitally for the next 24 months leading to very high valuations before a big collapse. This is usually reffered to as the mania phase.
Anything is possible

I can create a social network to compete with facebook, doesnt mean facebook has no value.

Monetary value is now synonymous with network value.
This is a hard concept to grasp but worth understanding.
Commodity money had value because of its properties and amount of usage.
Cryptocurrencies have value because of their properties and amount of usage.
Some added properties of cryprocurrencies that commodity money didnt have however is "quality of development team" and "Security of the network (hashing power)."
So value is derived in the same way value in commodity money is derived except with a few digital-age twists thrown in.

Golds supply is a function of demand. If demand rises the price increases making it more profitable to mine increasing the supply.
Bitcoins supply is not affected by demand, more demand does not create more bitcoin. So in that sense btcoin is scarcer than gold.
Fiat is used solely for payments, gold is used in jewlery and as a store of value.
Bitcoin represents faster cheaper payments, a a scarcer store of value, and i would argue a decentralized platform of trust is more useful than jewlery.

The people looking to get rich quick will either sell when they all of a sudden made a quick buck. Or they will sell when the price starts crashing. The only people truely holding are those that believe in its long term potential. Either from a technological perspective or from a sound money (anti inflation) perspective.
The greedy come and ago and that causes bubbles and busts but many idelogically driven users stay no matter what.
If you could see everything thats happening behind the scenes and ignore the speculative facade then it would be more obvious. But very few people take the time to look below the surface.
This reddit is the epitome of the surface. There is nothing substantial on here. Which suits me fine as I dont want the price to keep rising like this, we need a healthy correction.

My point is there is demand in the world for trillions of dollars in value to be moved daily (just from one bank), if bitcoin eventually moves as much money between people around the world as this one bank then the price needs to be alot higher to make that possible.
You cant move a trillion dollars a day when the total amount of all bitcoin in existance is only 80 billion.
If bitcoin gets adopted for global money transmission then the price will need to rise dramatically along with demand.
Is bitcoin overvalued short term on a technical analysis basis? Probably. Is it undervalued compared to its potential as a monetary transmission system? Absolutely.

"Jurisdiction refers to a Court's authority to apply laws to disputes between parties and to do so in a way that can be enforced. (My old legal dictionary is even pithier: it's "the power to hear and determine a case").[2]
Legal liability (distributed or not) can only be established by a Court that has jurisdiction. Enforceable legal liability presupposes jurisdiction.
In the US, the Constitution and a variety of statutes define the scope of Court's jurisdiction and describe the kinds of disputes that they can adjudicate. (I'm a U.S. lawyer, so I do draw on U.S. legal principles, though I imagine that jurisdiction is a threshold requirement in most places)."
Not my content but explains it succinctly.
If that bitcoin is not entirely accessible by the plaintiff then jurisdiction dictates it is outside the realm of leagal liability.
I think everyone will eventually have a solution set up where-in they can claim they dont have access to that bitcoin entirely within one legal jurisdiction. For example a 2of3 multisig where one key in your hands, another in your overseas relatives hands and a secret back up key completely unknown. This scheme is then used as an ATM where you access your funds when needed but if sued you can claim the 2nd key is not in your name or legal possession and out of legal jurisdiction. In fact im certain there will be services that act in this manner pop up all over the world. Just like andreas antonopoulos's start up "3rd key solutions". This is not illegal. It is the same as setting up a company to hold assets. There is nothing illegal about using a scheme to protect assets. It just so happens that with bitcoin it is far easier and far cheaper than incorporating a company to achieve it.

wow, not a liability in accounting terms obviously, a liability in terms of legal responsibility.. Bitcoin is the only financial asset you can own that is not simultaneously someone else's legal responsibility!

Store of value does not mean stable value. It means the ability to store value in a manner entirely under your control free from counterparty risk like bankruptsy theft and inflation.
Bitcoin (when stored properly) is safe from bankruptsy theft and inflation. That is why it is a store of value.
The people who cant see past the current volatility dont understand this. Those of us with the foresight to comprehend a world where bitcoin is more mature and less volatile can see that it is the best store of value the world has ever known.

Gold is a good electricity conductor, its has desirable properties for industry, it is a good safe haven store of value.

True, big time. 
But I think the first audience participant was John Williams of shadowstats, his rant like questioning and content of his questions made him look like he lost more than anyone else.
"Bitcoin is the same as fiat because nothing backs it"
I mean **face palm**
First off fiat means to decree value through law, it has nothing to do with "backing" something.
Secondly what backs gold? The answer is scarcity and a sprinkle of non-monetary utility.
What backs bitcoin? Scarcity and a sprinkle of non-monetary utility.
What non-monetary utiility does bitcoin have? Well name me another global, decentralized, censorship resistant, politically neutral protocol that has the hash power security and immutability properties of bitcoin. Not even ethereum is immutable. 
Why is this non-monetary utility? Because the world has never before had a protocol that can immutably record information in a way that is impossible to change after the fact. 
Bitcoins utility is as a protocol of trust, the most obvious and most important use of this platform is money. But other "utilities" exist like verifiable uncorruptable record keeping and auditing as just one.
And I would argue that the ability to immutably record digital fingerprints of timestamped data on a globally accessible platform without trust in any authority or company along with zero downtime is vastly more valuable than using gold in dental work.

This chart is interesting.
Right after gold futures were launched there was a bear market, just like bitcoin, then another bubble and subsequent crash and then gold ETFs launched right before a massive run.
So yea I can imagine bitcoin running to $100k from here, crashing to $30k and then seeing an ETF launched that takes the price to $1M.
Would be like golds history repeating in bitcoin. Or in other words bitcoin achieving in 15 years what took gold 5000 years. 
The first gold ETF saw the dawn of an 8 year bull run that took the market cap of gold from $2T to $11T. An increase in market cap of $9 Trillion dollars, for a shiny rock people wear around their necks. A bitcoin ETF could easily take bitcoin well above $100,000 if not higher.
Everyone else ready for a 5 year long bull run in bitcoin? I know I am.

really?? how does going into the bathroom stop intimidation in the work place or vote buying? they talk about the influence of friends, family, colleagues and spouses, in that situation going into the bathroom means u don't want them to see and therefore they assume u are doing it because you are voting in a different direction than them.. compulsory secret ballots are essential to fair and true voting, tell me how you achieve a provable secret ballot from an iphone.
a simple solution could be based on plausible deniability, a system where u can vote from your phone once by a certain date, but then have the ability to change that vote from any computer over the following month or so.. that way even if u are intimidated or pressured into voting a certain way, u can change it in private after the fact.. also this stops vote buying as the person buying the vote cannot prove you wont change it again..

Incorrect. Greshams law applied to competing commodity currencies during past monetary transitions. Greshams law is the free market reaction to a natural instinct of wanting to hold onto the currency with a higher percieved value. Perception being subjective. Generally that subjective value boils down to which form of money has better long term properties of money, and in most cases that means which is more valued by the society you live in. 
In a world of debt based, constantly inflating, fiat currencies the better form of money is one that is just as transportable yet with a limited supply.

This is not about avoiding taxes. This is about protecting assets from law suits. For example if you are in a car accident and the plaintiff sues you for everything you "own".
If you own a company and that company owns your assets (a holding company of which you are the sole director) you still pay any taxes due personally through a salary you pay yourself and corporate taxes on company profits. But your assets are protected from personal law suits against you because you dont own those assets your company does.
Its a legal way of saying you own everything indirecty through managing control of that company but nothing directly as nothing is in your name.
Every person on earth who has more than a few hundred thousand dollars in net assets does this because it is easy and cheap and protects your assets from litigation. All it costs is around $2000 per year to form and maintain a sole director LLC.
All I am saying is bitcoin can achieve this state of owning everything indirectly but nothing directly without the hassle of registering a company or a trust (separate legal entity).
If you sell it and make profits you still pay taxes but when it comes to being sued that bitcoin can be outside of a courts jurisdiction and also ourside of liability due to the fact it is not owned in your name.
You control the bitcoin private key entirely but the bitcoin is not held in your name. In exactly the same way as you control a company but the companies assets are not held in your name.
This is entirely legal and the reason company and corporate structures were invented in the first place; to reduce personal liability, not tax liability - personal liability. Hence the name "limited liability company - LLC"
The thing that will have to be tested in the court system through setting precedent will be whether bitcoin has to be held in a separate legal entity to remove it from being held in your name, or whether having a second party control a second key removes it from your name, or whether the internet itself cannot be sued and bitcoin is held inside the internet and you merely control it so it is not in your name. 
In other words when you have bitcoin in your wallet you dont own it you merely control it therefore removing liability.
In any case im probably dreaming and ownership will probably be determined by who controls it whether thats an individual or partnership or company.
Will be interesting to see some precedents set once people start suing over bitcoin that is multisig protected by multiple people around the world. My thoughts are that if it becomes law that a 1 of 5 key holder can gets sued and then the entirety of that bitcoin is due to be liquidated how does that bode with the other 4 key holders who are separate from the person being sued, and is that a dangerous precedent. If that happened it would also mean if a company director was sued for a car accident then the other 4 company directors would loose everything too even though they had nothing to do with the car accident and the car accident has nothing to do with the company. And that wont happen because it would completely break down the corporate structure in that country making limited liability companies useless undoing everything built up since 1602 when the first company on earth was formed.
A company is just a legal contract.
A multisig wallet is also just a contract, but is it legally recognised or not, that is the ultimate question.
This is going to be a very interesting space to watch and see it evolve because if a multisig wallet is viewed of as a contract between multiple parties, regardless of who retains ultimate control of the bitcoin, then this will have profound effects on how people can protect finacial assets in the future from greedy people trying to unreasonably sue you because they fell down your stairs or such ridiculous BS.

I have heard many times that gold is the 'only' financial asset that is not simultaneously someone else's liability, and that is not true, because bitcoin is a financial asset, albiet a fringe one..
Combine that with the fact that gold cannot integrate into the modern financial system without introducing 3rd party or intermediary risk. So it is not a liability if you are holding a gold coin in a safe you own, but as soon as you want to use gold in the financial world the statement that it is not someone else's liabilty becomes false because there will need to be a trusted intermediary to issue credits based on its value or take responsibility for its transportation..
Therefore Bitcoin is the only modern financial asset that is not simultaneously someone else's liability.

Yes thats why paper wallets are only good for long term storage. Not spending. Never reuse a private key after its been exposed to any type of online device in any way.
Also remember when importing a paper wallet private key import the entire amount at once, otherwise you may lose funds to change address you dont control. Atleast that was the case a few years ago, hopefully that doesnt happen anymore.
If you want offline cold storage thats easy to spend then you need to buy a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s or trezor.

firstly he sounds like a gold bug touting the idea gold has intrinsic value yet bitcoin does not..
He fails to comprehend the intrinsic value of bitcoin from a programmers perspective..
He thinks all bitcoiners are libertarians who want to replace all money completely.. Yet most of us see the potential of it as a global trustless financial backbone for anyone to move value over the internet (dollars included)..
He has never even heard of counterparty, and I highly doubt he has ever heard of bitreserve which does exactly what he says it needs to do to succeed..
All his arguments are based on the idea that nothing will be built on top of the bitcoin protocol, therefore we need a centralised blockchain that can do all that.. The point is the global free market will build better more innovative services on top of bitcoin than any centralised blockchain could ever dream of achieving..
His argument about no bank wanting to let the miners hold their money for 10 minutes has some point at the current point in time. It will take time for the security and decentralisation of mining to prove itself, most programmers believe it already has, for banks it will take a bit longer to trust the network, but if bitcoin dosent fail that trust will be built over time.. Just look at the new start-up Digital Asset Holdings lead by Blythe Masters, this is a perfect example of traditional wall st trusting in that network security enough to build a potentially huge financial business on top of bitcoin.

Are you a lawyer? Or are you just making assumptions based on a lack of understanding about how legal asset protection works?
Can a judge say you need to sell the bitcoin held in a 10 year time locked "contract" or go to jail. Can a judge say you need to sell all the bitcoin you control even if the other 4 parties all jointly own that same bitcoin and have nothing to do with the law suit?
You can control bitcoin keys while that bitcoin belongs to someone else.
Does the custodianship of bitcoin in an exchange mean they own it all just because they control the keys? Does a law suit against coinbase mean all the people holding their bitcoin on coinbase loose their funds?
Its a complex situation which is why i brought it up. It is a grey area still because of the way asset protection works. Its just interesting to watch how the functions and contracts of bitcoin wallets will be integrated into existing asset protection law.

Liability = the state of being legally responsible for something. 
A company is legally responsible on many levels for its company and underlying stock. From issuing shares of stock, to dilution of shares, to buyback of shares, to the companies legal obligations to its share holders, even its operation as a profitable company..
The stock you hold bares legal responsibility to the company who issued it.. Bitcoin has no legal liability, there is no Bitcoin company, and you don't need any 'holder of liability' to use bitcoin at a global level as you do with gold.

Exactly this.
Up until this point that was the case. If bitcoin is falling it is too risky to invest in. If its rising its too expensive.
However this is the first time in bitcoins short history that a sharp rise has lasted more than a few weeks. This rise has been ongoing for atleast 6 months. Which IMO gives these people the confidence that it may not crash this time, plus the time to learn how to buy and store it before being put off by a crash.
This may very well be the begining of a 2 year bull run in bitcoin. Taking us well into the mania phase. We might see prices previously unimaginable within the next 24 months. Before an 80% crash (back to $500,000) and finally some long term stability which will give merchants the confidence to accept btc directly.
This will be the biggest money making opportunity in my life time. And it wont last much longer. Those that havent already bought will miss the boat. Those that buy in 12 months from now will only make a small gain and those that buy in 24 months from now will loose money.
My prediction is we hit $10,000 by the end of the year, then go somewhat sideways for 6 months (bringing in confidence that crashes are a thing of the past) and then spend 18 months rallying non stop up to a few million per btc (insanly overvalued) before we crash and settle at around $500k.
This falls inline with human nature, greed, mania, where btc needs to be to be usable and stable in global commerce.
This will happen and it will blow peoples minds.
My main point is if everyone (the supporters and he haters) think bitcoin is a bubble then it isnt. Im a contrarian investor. It wont be in its final stages of a bubble until everyone thinks it is NOT a bubble. And that will take a few years of never falling prices to be the case.
Edit: all price estimates and timelines mentioned are extremely rough examples used solely to try and explain a theory. They should not be taken as expert opinion. No body knows the future.

The fact is bitcoin has a market cap of $80 billion yet only moves a couple of billion dollars in value daily.

Its not about hiding assets at all. Its definitely not about hiding assets from the government. 
Its about protecting assets. Its about the legal right (which many people legally exercise today) to control assets without owning them in your name so as to protect them from your personal legal liability to some random dude suing you for ridiculous reasons.
You can legally control any asset without owning it in your name by owning a company of which you are the sole director and that asset is in the companies name, not yours.
The question is can this be achieved with bitcoin without the hassle of first registering a company because of the contract nature of transactions.
I think you might want to read up on how to use a company or corporate trust to protect personal assets from personal legal liability. Most people dont know about it but its the first rule of investing. Own nothing directly but control everything indirectly.
Most people own their home their cars and their business in their name. This is the biggest mistake on earth because one law suit can wipe you out. Anyone with half a brain or decent accounting advice uses family trusts and companies to protect their assets.

Even if you create all private keys for a Coinkite multisig wallet offline, you still dont have access over your funds if Coinkite fails or runs into legal problems, because you need their symmetric key to recover funds.. and they wont release that key unless they are facing failure, which doesn't fly with me.. sure it protects against hacking or the wallet stealing funds, but if Coinkite for some reason can't reveal their symmetric key then ur funds are as good as gone..

People sue for money. If someone has no money no one sues. If someone has money (even if they are not the most liable party) they get targeted because thats where the money is.
If someone has all their assets in their own name they get sued. If someone has all their assets in a separate legal entity that law suit is dropped or an insurance payout is accepted as worthy remuneration.
So yes law suits are targeted towards the people who have the most amount of money in least protected way.
Would you sue me if i had 3 properties, 2 bank accounts and 4 cars in my own name? Yes. 
Would you sue me if i had nothing in my name as it was all held in a separate legal entity? Maybe, but is the expense of the law suit worth the likely hood you wont pierce my corporate veil and wont end up being able to claim anything? No.
Would you sue me if i had no assets in my name as they were all inside a separate legal entity that was also in an offshore jurisdiction? No chance, because you know you wont get shit so why waste the money trying to sue me.
For most people their main asset is not their home as thats just a mortgage, the house is in the banks name. For most people the only thing worth suing for is the bank account in their name. 
Bitcoin is a like a bank account inside a separate legal entity that is also registered in an offshore jurisdiction. This will greatly reduce the number of law suits filed against average people. 
If you commt a crime, then you get punished. But if you caused an ACCIDENT you are protected and insurance money is enough for the plaintiff, not insurance money plus your entire life savings.

A country with high inflation means prices rise faster than wages. Making goods and services more expensive for the people living there while at the same time appearing cheaper to other nations.
A country with low inflation means wages keep up with prices. 
A country with no inflation would allow wages to stay stable while prices decline. 
A country with high inflation has the cheapest products while at the same time the highest cost of living for their citizens.
A country with low inflation has more expensive products but a lower cost of living for their citizens.
A country with no inflation would have the most expensive products but salaries would be so high the cost of living would be next to nothing.

Just like it did under gold. House prices never exceeded what people could afford to save within a 10 year period. Under sound money home prices represent demand in the form of savings, under fiat money home prices represent demand in the form of credit availability.
Under sound money things are priced based on supply of that product vs demand, and demand is limited to savings.
Under fiat money things are priced based on supply of that product vs demand, and demand is limited to how much you can borrow.
So the price of land would reduce to the point people could afford that land plus building costs. Supply and demand.
Homes wouldnt be unattainable, prices would fall to meet demand.
House price growth over the last 50 years was driven mainly by credit availability and peoples willingness to borrow more and more, also exacerbated by low intetest rates the last decade. That will revert.
Credit should not be used to buy homes cars clothes and groceries in a healthy economy. Credit should be used solely to fund new business and business related expansion. As it was under gold. Under gold savings rates were so high because of productivity constantly reducing the cost of living, so much that credit wasnt required by the average person. 
In other words credit is used for productive purposes where the income generated from the loans purpose pays back the loan. Credit is not for unproductive uses that dont generate income.
You might argue what about emergency funds? Today this is done using credit cards on a 25%pa interest rate. Lots of people would be willing to loan their btc out for a profit of 25% pa. This doesnt require more btc being created to pay back the loan, it requires the borrower to  take money from their future salary into the future to pay back a past loan. Spending your future productivity in the present doesnt require more btc to be created, it just requires you to live beyond your means in the present and then live below your means in the future.

Bitcoin will be stifled to the point of non-existance in countries where the political process is corrupt and rule of law is weak. In countries with strong rule of law any ban will be fought in the court system.
Thats why the first to fall will be corrupt dictatorial nations like china, parts of africa, india etc.
The thing is in a country where the rule of law is weak and corruption is high citizens rarely follow directive from the state because their culture is defined by corruption at the top which flows down the ranks all the way to the average person.
So in corrupt countires bitcoin will be declared illegal but people will find other ways to buy and hold bitcoin. In democratic countries a bitcoin ban will be fought by VCs with deep pockets in the court system ending in restricted use but not a ban.
The world will continue on until no amount of fighting it can kill it and it becomes stupid to ban it in the eyes of everyone. Millenials are entering political ranks now and soon we will have presidents that used bitcoin when they were younger.

"innovation is including everyone"
Isn't that what the internet did? sure some communities will lag in terms of access, but as a global human good, the internet offers the potential to include everyone!
Thats also what bitcoin does, it dosent care if you are using a smart phone or an sms feature phone, it still includes everyone, technology is neutral, it includes everyone.
The problem is not with technology it is with government controls, government regulation and government corruption.. that is what prevents a community from inclusion. If you live in a place where you cannot afford access to the same tools the wealthy in your country use, then that is a direct result of corruption! corruption in wealth, corruption in regulation, corruption in economics, corruption in freefom, and that responsibility lies with the government not the technology!
According to this guy we shouldn't allow digital land ownership for the people that need it most, because in that country the level of corruption is such that a wealthy land developer can literally still steal that ownership from the poor! once again it isn't a technology problem its a government problem, and at the end of the day the blockchain is incorruptible.

It works exactly the same as the stock market and exactly the same as the current forex currency markets.
It is completely decided by the open market, and the forces of supply and demand.
If demand is greater than supply the price will rise. If supply is greater than demand the price will fall.
But if you want an actual reason as to why it may rise or fall here are a few reasons as to why it may rise:
1) 
The issuance just halved from 25btc every block to 12.5btc every block. As this reduced supply slowly works its way into the market the price should rise to reflect that. After the last halving in November 2012 the next 12 months saw the price go from $10 to a peak of $1000.
Bitcoin ETFs will be on the market before the years end. Allowing large hedge funds, investment banks and institutional investors to now buy bitcoin in a regulated manner. Increasing demand and pushing the price higher.
The majority of bitcoins magic has been ignored by all the blockchain hype over the past 2 years. Blockchain is now at the peak if inflated expections point of the gartners hypecycle and as all the banks realise that it is harder than they thought and will takr longer than they thought the hype around blockchain will dissipate and the attention will move back to bitcoin, which is coming out of the trough of dissolusionment stage of the hype cycle as real apps and usability finally arrives. This attention will push the price up
As far as what might make bitcoin go down. There are lots of factors like regulation or the scaling issues but this is all mainly short term noise. Long term it doesnt matter what regulators think and scaling is inevitable.

After the last halving end of 2012 the following 12 months saw a 100x increase in price ($10 to $1000).. knowing that each bubble will be less each time as volatility decreases and market cap rises, this halving may very well see a 5x to 10x increase. There is nothing abnormal about expecting that. It is very possible that by july 2017 we are at a price settling in the thousands of dollars per coin.

Im a customer there, and even if im one in a thousand that still means 2000 people in duabi would use this service, and that's enough potential business for them to look into the idea..
The idea here is not to make them integrate btc overnight eventhough that would be great for alot of people here. Instead, what this does is show demand, so as they do recognize btc more and more they can see there is already demand which will lead to faster adoption than would otherwise be the case..
Your perspective assumes bitcoin adoption here will not grow at all in the coming years, I mean how much lack of vision do you need to actually believe a country full of international expats and migrant workers, with a government that pushes tech on its service providers, and an environment of amazing economic freedom, wont grow to see and implement the benefits of global decentralised payments..

Its not a new paradigm for economics we are simply moving away from the last 50 year experiment in keynesian economics back to austrian economics.
Having not enough money to run an economy is a myth. Any amount is enough so long as it is divisible, that was the downfall of gold and why we ended up using a bi-metalic standard including silver and then paper reciepts (currency), it was caused by lack of physical divisibility. Remember the paper money created by banks in the 1800s was still backed by their individual gold reserves.
If productivity increases so does supply, when supply increases prices then fall, meaning in essense the economy is absorbed into the total money stock raising everyones standard of living not just those that get pay rises. Inflationary money increases so much that not only are the gains in productivity not felt by the economy by way of falling prices, but prices increase. Thats why it takes an increase of 7% in the money supply to feel CPI rise by 2%, brcause that 5% spread is the productivity gains being inflated away.
If your medium of exchange is sufficiently divisible the total quantity being set is not a problem. Increased productivity will just lead to a declining cost of living for all.

but implementations aside, the core P2SH protocol will never change right? so as long as I have my private keys and redemption script there will always be an open source tool available for me to create the raw transaction data then sign and transmit it to the bitcoin network. correct? in the same way as as-long as there is an open source tool like bitaddress.org then a brainwallets private keys can always be recovered for import no matter whats going on with implementations on the consumer facing side of bitcoin.

Holders might just support this idea so much they will only spend once its accepted and never sell for fiat. Then theres the ones that want to avoid taxes, like it isnt considered taxable if its considered money and your just buying coffee..
There is nothing wrong with hoarding bitcoin..
Also hoarding raises the value.. you know what merchants all over the world are saying right now. "There is $200 billion sitting there looking for something to buy, they might as well spend it at my store". Small business owners will do anything to increase their sales! On the other hand if everyone kept selling for fiat to spend it then the value wouldnt be there.

If the price falls to $1 then we are celebrating lightning mainnet holding $10!
On the other hand if the price rises to $100k then we are celebrating LN mainnet holding $1,000,000.00
I happen to believe it will be the latter, but in anycase bitcoin is a finite resource. It would make much more sense to say LN mainnet now holds 0.00005% of all bitcoin in circulation. Then major milestones will become 0.1%, 1%, 10% etc. Much less confusing given the volatility of btc/usd.

Miners decide what the network should look like.. thats a bit over the top.. yes, miners are free to fork and mine their own version of bitcoin. But there are 5 constituancies of consensus (miners, merchants, users, developers and exchanges) so we as a whole decide which chain to follow, and if we dont follow their "greedchain" they end up mining a worthless fork.

My train of thought was that since their is nothing recorded at all besides each blocks coinbase transaction and the UTXO set, then there is nothing you can go back to rewrite. There is no history to change. In btc PoW is required to prevent the rewriting of the blockchains past, it cant as easily prevent a 51% attack that wants to double spend in the future etc, but PoW does make bitcoin extremely expensive to rewrite the past, even a couple of days in the past. So PoW exists to protect the past not the future. 51% attacks are different from immutability. MW does not need PoW to be immutable as there is nothing in the chain to rewrite. All you need in MW is a consensus mechanism that prevents 51% attacks, this could be anything that maintains decentralisation, like an algo that randomly selects a miner based on IP or proof of resource like storage capacity or for a bank  a multi-sig signing capability where blocks are verified by all constituancies in an automated fashion.
My point is (as best as I understand) MW needs a consensus mechanism for decentralisation reasons and to prevent double spending into the future, but it does not need proof of work to remain immutable and protect its history. If your transaction is not recorded on the blockchain, as are all transactions in MW, then there is nothing to rewrite. Its as if it never existed, how can you change something that never existed.
The UTXO set does not correspond to any public or private keys, and the coinbase transaction in each block also does not correspond to any public or private keys.. so what is there that can be changed. The state of the network is a single constant metric (not a record of transactions), you cant change a constant metric that doesnt seemingly relate to any keys in the network.
Please correct me if im wrong, but this is my train of thought currently.

I will simply keep multiple copies of the redemption script with the private keys..

For example Coinkite which is well known, let you generate the private keys offline, but they still hold a master symmetric key value or something, that means their service is required to make transactions and all private keys are useless without their symmetric key... I can take the 3 same xprv keys I used with them, and run them through ms-brainwallet but never derive the same public address no matter how I do it..
They only release their symmetric key in the event of closure or failure of the business, and that doesn't fly with me at all..

Then please tell me what is bitcoins "limit" in USD?
Think about this. What if the USD went to zero, crashed, hyperinflated, whatever. What would the dollar price of one bitcoin be?
During hyperinflation one coffee could cost $1 billion dollars.  In that situation what would one bitcoin be worth?
If your measuring bitcoin in dollars then there is no known limit, therefore its potentially unlimited until a limit is known.
Given if the dollar is turned into confetti through hyperinflation then no one would want dollars and you wouldnt want to be measuring bitcoin in dollars. But while we are measuring bitcoin in dollars then technically there is no limit to how many dollars 1 bitcoin can be worth because the dollar can in theory go to zero.
Everyone knows that one divided by zero is infinity. Ergo potentially unlimited.

You are wrong.
The issuance algorithm has nothing to do with how much energy is being used. Even if there were only 2 laptops mining the reward of new bitcoins would be exactly the same.

Whenever media outlets post graphs or opinions about bitcoins bubble being the biggest in history and about to crash, they only talk in percentage gains, not market cap adjusted for inflation.
They fail to acknoledge that all prior historical bubbles had a significantly higher total market cap at their peaks (adjusted for inflation). All they look at is percentage gains on a time frame that suits their narrative.
Bitcoin is volatile, yes, it swings alot, yes, it has overblown hype cycles, yes. But when compared to any other global asset class on earth it is peanuts. It doesnt even register it is so small.

Over the long term the answer is obvious.

If prices are denominated in bitcoin is then it will look like the dollar is falling 2% per year.

Go to Dubai and tell me how intrinsically valuable heat is.
Intrinsic value is a myth.
Value is a mechanism of attributing human desire to something. Like you said, it is humans who attribite value, not the item dictating it has value. Something only has value if it is desired or required. 
Now food, water, shelter and heat are useful, but value is determined separately from usefulness. Something can be useful but not desired or valued its all about perception.
Beef and vegetables are both food and useful to prevent starvation but beef has no value to a vegan.
Food and shelter are intrinsically usefull but value is relative. They are not the same thing.
Even gold. Gold is useful for some things but value is relative. There is nothing specific about gold itself that gives it value, it is however useful and usefulness can create human desire which creates value.
Value comes from us attributing it. Not from the object itself.

Also the term deflation is used in two ways. Almost like a double meaning. There is consumer price (CPI) deflation, and also monetary deflation (contraction of the money supply). These are two very different things.
There is the word deflation used in terms of fiat. That is the contraction of the money supply (as opposed to inflation which is the expansion of the money supply). When debt levels contract the money supply contracts along with it because loans are also newly created money (fractional reserve banking), so when the loan dissapears (defaults/paid back) so does the money that was created out of nothing to issue the loan. In aggregate this can cause a banking liquidity crisis that can quickly evolve into a full blown financial meltdown. So for fiat money the term deflation is very bad.
Then there is the word deflation used in terms of sound money. Sound money cant dissapear like fiat debt when loans are paid back. It can only be saved or spent. If it is saved then prices of goods and services fall slightly or remain stable. This is price (CPI) deflation not monetary deflation. There is nothing wrong with price (CPI) deflation. Prices of goods and services falling slightly (like electronics) is just a reward to society for building things more efficiently.
So the term deflation is bad for fiat but neutral for sound money.
Its important to understand the distinction.

Making money scarce does not prevent lending. All it does is encourage savings and capital investment along with keeping prices of goods and services stable.
Bitcoin or gold for example can incorporate any amount of value required, simply by the free market raising its price.
In a digital world bitcoin can be lent globally a lot easier than fiat. Digital crowd funding peer to peer is much better and more flexible than bank lending.

A form of money that isnt being endlessly created and gifted to bankers will ultimately be redistributed naturally to the most productive people in society over time.
That is mind blowingly better than what we use today.
It could even be said that if someone prefers to keep fiat which is CENTRALLY CONTROLLED from the amount of money to the price of money (interest rates) then they are socialist. Bitcoin is the definition of free market capitalism.

Thats my point though.
He couldnt envision uninvented 2nd layer solutions, thats why he only wanted to raise the blocksize when absolutly necessary. 
If he wanted BU he would have never implemented the 1mb limit in the first place. Obviously his idea of bitcoins future (free flow of transactions while keeping node decentralisation strong) is much more in-line with LN.

It shouldnt. They are reffering to base money. Paper money stock only. There is a FAR greater amount of money out there in the form of credit.

Look at a 4 year price chart. Go back to July 2016 when the the halving happened and tell me when this bull run began. 
The price has fallen since early 2014 from $1000 down to $200 where it had found a base for all of 2015 and half of 2016. Then the halving happened in july 2016. That is the point the price started moving from $200 to $500 to $1,000 to $20,000.
Price does absorb a supply shock in a day. It takes time, in this case around 12 months for the price to readjust.
Also why does this opinion about a mega bull run bother you?

The biggest and most overlooked problem with international wire transfers is not usually the speed of 3-5 business days (which is a joke in the age of the internet) as for some reason people have become accustomed to this over time. 
The bigger problem is the fact that once you initiate the transfer it dissapears from your bank and floats around the world through many correspondant banks. During this time your bank has no idea where your money is or when it will arrive. And if you need to know this info then you need to pay your bank a huge fee to trace this for you. You will only know the money has arrived once the person you sent the money to informs you it has arrived. You also never know the amount of fees that will be deducted along the way making it impossible to know the exact amount of money that will arrive in the recipients account. 
This part in and of itself is the biggest joke and a far greater problem than the transfer time alone.

Letting it breathe all the time (no limit) would invite the potential of ongoing spam transactions to bloat the blockchain affecting node decentralisation. A limit that only rises slightly after 6 months of being pushed to the limit would allow it to breathe for legitimate reasons. Who is going to spend the money to spam the network for 6 months straight before they see any effect of their attack?
Right now we are ddosing ourselves. I wanted to send my friend $5 today paying a 10 cent fee. It didnt go through so i gave up. I will wait for it to leave the mempool and forget i even tried. Its not worth it to me to pay more than 10 cents for the fee. I sure as shit aint spending $1 to give my friend $5. So for me bitcoin is currently not useful as money. You can no longer say bitcoin is a global currency. It just isnt anymore.. so what is it now? SWIFT? I didnt sign up for a new SWIFT, I dont need a new SWIFT.. so I will leave and support something else that works. I want bitcoin to work but if it isnt then it isnt, not much i can do about that.

First of all why would I want a stable coin. The USD falls year on year causing prices to rise year on year. The whole point of bitcoin being created in the first place was to get rid of inflationary fiat currencies that fall over the long term and give us a long term store of value like gold.

If bitcoins use as a store of value (non transmission) is greater than its demand for transacting then I would agree with you completely. I just feel like the amount of work going into companies that need transactions to operate is higher than the number of people using it as a store of value. If i never wanted to transact then I would choose gold over bitcoin as it cant get hacked, i cant loose my private keys, my gold is in a safe. As a non transactable store of value gold wins hands down.. its only when you want to send that value that bitcoin wins. And if u cant send it then why bring in the risk of hacking when you can buy a bar of gold.

It fundamentally boils down to two options. Remain operational while we scale and evolve the protocol, Or, become inop and unusable while we scale and evolve.
The end result will be the same, an efficient bitcoin that can handle everything imaginable. But why are we choosing to be inop while we scale instead of remaining operational while we scale. A floating blocksize is the perfect solution to this problem. Short term the blocksize will grow ever so slightly, then once LN activates the blocksize will drop below 1mb, then grow again as we gain users, then drop again once we scale the core protocol. So on and so forth. The average blocksize over that time will even out to 1mb but will allow the protocol to breathe while we scale.
So I say again. Why choose to remain inop while we scale if we can be operational while we scale.

Omg wat? Lol what did I just read??


Thats called going long. Buying low and profiting from a higher price is a long trade not a short trade.
Going short means borrowing bitcoin, selling at a high price, then buying back at a lower price, paying back the bitcoin you owe and keeping the difference. You profit based on the amount the market falls.
The most the market can drop from here is 100%, while the potential for it to rise is orders of magnitude more than 100%.
Yes, going short means selling at todays price and buying back at a price in the future. But you profit from the fall in price, not the subsequent bounce back in price you are alluding to. I really hope you arn't trading.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:43:17
This is retarded. For this to be accurate in any way you would need to assertain the value of all those companies when they were first invented and launched. NOT AT IPO.
Who here can tell me what apple was trading at when it started in steve jobs basement. Or what google was trading at when they released their beta?
Buying 10k worth of bitcoin at 6 cents as the picture illustrates would be like investing 10k into apple while they were building computers in their parents basement. Not during their IPO.
If anything, bitcoins IPO could be considered the launch of futures back in November 2017.
The price gains from 2010 until now are equivelant to what Angel investors or Venture Capitalists usually only get to partake in.

Bell curve is the opposite of a bubble.. if it levels out instead of crashing it wasnt a bubble, it was healthy growth.
Bitcoin is still way too volatile for that.

You do understand no matter how much they bid for a spot in a block, there is only limited space right!
Its like saying there are 20 thousand people rocking up to a port every 10 minutes. But each ship that departs every 10 minutes can only take 8 thousand people. So no matter how much u pay there will always be people left out not getting on a ship. And there will always constantly be people not getting on at all. 
Its better to have 1 million people onboard paying a cent each, rather than 10 thousand people onboard paying a dollar each while 990 thousand are waiting. The end result is the same! $10,000 per block.. why is that so hard to understand.
In my post I state a floating blocksize would average out to 1mb over time but with periods of higher blocksizes and periods of lower blocksizes relative to scaling solutions.

Go back and tell me a time when bitcoin broke above   macro ATHs and only rallied for 10 days.
In 2013 after we broke above the previous high of $260 we ran higher for 4 weeks before the bubble was over.
This time we may very well run for longer than 4 weeks for 2 reasons.
1) We had a much longer than normal pullback from 2014 until now compared to previous pullbacks.
2) "blockchain" hype and media awareness did not exist back in 2013.

Yes with leverage. But leverage works both ways. 10x or 100x leverage can help a correct short position but it also magnifies a correct long position so that point is moot as it doesnt make shorting more profitable than going long. Both long and short positions benefit.

Bitcoins live on the internet inside the bitcoin protocol. What you own is a private key. This private key gives you access to those bitcoins that is all. This private key can be created in an offline environment therefore making the storage of bitcoin seem as though it is offline. In other words your private key has never been seen by an online device.
The only thing driving the price is supply and demand. Right now demand is higher than supply, including newly mined bitcoins.
It is volatile because it is a small market. A relatively small amount of money can move the market. Once the market is worth more then it will be hard for even large amounts of money to move the market.
If you dont know when you should buy then just dollar cost average. Buy the same dollar amount every week for a year to spread out your average buying cost.
Desktop wallets are not really considered safe but are better than leaving funds on an exchange.
Best bet for storage is a hardware wallet, or paper wallet created on an offline computer.

If a couple of million kids using bitcoin can collapse the financial system then why would you want humanity to continue using such a fragile system. There is a far greater chance that extreme money printing experiments around the world cause major problems.
Finance broadly defined should not be a function of dictate. It should be a competative open market where humanity as a whole gets to choose whats right for them. If todays existing financial system cant handle competition then it is not beneficial in the least to humanity.

If he was pro bigger blocks then why did he implement the 1mb limit in the first place.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:06:04




Yes he did. His name is Matt Miller and he was on bloomberg in late 2013 early 2014 showing viewers his paper wallet, the funny thing was he showed the camera the whole paper wallet including the private key and it was swept by a reddit user when the segment aired. The reddit user sent it back to him and all was good, but it was a big laugh and big news on the bitcoin subreddit back then. 
He has also been interviewed for at least one mini documentary on bitcoin before.
Source 1: 
I remember all this because he was the first bloomberg host back then to get excited about btc and take it semi-seriously. He even did a segment on bloomberg over the 2013 christmas holidays which he called "the 12 days of Bitcoin" where he bought bitcoin and lived off of it for 12 days. Each day during this 12 day segment he would talk about his experience using bitcoin . Good guy.

1mb blocks for the next 5 years will add a further 260 GB to the blockchain.
2mb blocks for the next 5 years will add a further 520 GB to the blockchain
4mb blocks for the next 5 years will add a further 1.04 TB to the blockchain.
Yes moving to 2mb blocks seems ok, maybe, but storage is not the issue. The issue is propogation and bandwidth.
If we want security by way of decentralisation we need nodes in homes, in phones, in cars, in as many places as humanly possible. Not just nodes in a few corruptable and coercible corporate data centers.
Lets scale now together to 1000tps and keep the network as decentralised as possible at the same time. Its ready and waiting.
If you dont want this then you are against bitcoin remaining decentralised. You are against security by way of decentralisation.

How is this so hard to understand. 
Your employer pays your income tax to the government on your behalf just as they do now. You recieve the balance as your pay check.
You pay VAT/GST when you purchase goods and services, the same as you do now. That is then handed over to the government as tax revenue.
Companies, organizations and corporations registered to operate in your country or region will disclose financial operations to the local tax authority and pay tax accordingly on behalf of employees (income tax), as part of total sales (VAT), and through their total profits (corporate income tax).
Regardless of the type of currency being used, corporations still need to register to do business and follow the rules.

In reality we are experiencing mini bubbles inside one massive bubble. This next run up into the multiple thousands is just another mini bubble. We will continue to see these mini bubbles until the main bubble collapses upward of $1 million and then stabalizes around $100k. Just a theory.
Regardless, every breakout into new highs over bitcoins history has bought with it atleast a month of rallying up hard. This current mini bubble has only been going for 10 days give or take after breaking out above $1350.
We will most likely continue to run for a few more weeks if not longer this time. Just history repeating

I may be wrong, but its seems as though a decentralised exchange converting m-pesa to btc would be accomplishable!
That would make it trival for mpesa users to instantly convert to btc to purchase btc denominated items in western countries, they could also recieve money in btc and instantly convert to mpesa making remittance super simple!
This would also eventually cause demand for more btc development to take place in kenya, ultimately leading to people moving away from mpesa to bitcoin..
and all its takes is for someone to build a decentralised exchange from mpesa to bitcoin!!

The price did not rise because of this. The same as it did not rise because of japan or anything else.
The price rose because this is where it was always going to go. Zoom out and look at a 5 year chart, this has been inevitable for the last year.
If anything at all caused this rise it is the supply halving that happend last year that is still working its way through the market. Price discovery in action.
In any case. Like I said before the market no longer gives a shit about an ETF denial. We just went through that 3 months ago. Its irrelevant now.

Short term noise is irrelevant. Bitcoin doesnt need a reason to go up or down. Once its been undervalued for long enough it will rally and become overvalued and then fall and become undervalued once again.
We are rising becuse of long term (macro) reasons. The halvening is still working its way through bitcoins price discovery mechanics. And we have been undervalued for 3 years. Its about time we have a big run.
BU, blocksize, exchange problems are all irrelevant short term noise that wont matter in 5 years from now. But bitcoins fundamentals as the worlds first and most robust scarce digital commodity will take it where it needs to go. And apparently that is up.

Im not handwaving. A floating blocksize keeps blocks small but also allows the protocol to breathe when absolutely necessary.
I agree small blocks are essential to decentralisation in the long run. But allowing the protocol to breathe to allow new devs and their full nodes is also essential to decentralization. A floating blocksize allows both to be realised.
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:38:49
A "blockchain" is a data structure that is linked by hashes. Turning a centralised alterable record into another centralised alterable record with the added ability to know if the data has been altered or not.
A blockchain alone does NOT provide immutability like bitcoin, it provides the ability to know if something has been altered or not but does not stop something from being altered and does not allow for informational changes to be reversed.
So you go from a record that can be altered with no trace, to a record that can be altered leaving proof it has been altered, but neither can stop that record from being altered.
Bitcoin or a truely decentralized POW blockchain is the only thing that can stop information from being altered all together, in the process creating trust without trustees.
With a blockchain alone you still need to trust the people maintaining the record.

Hopefully it is as simple as finding his back up seed (again, a list of 12 or 24 random english words) stored somewhere safe in is home. This would be the case whether he used a desktop wallet, a mobile wallet, or even a hardware wallet. 
This is your best bet and the easiest option to start.
It would either be printed out on a piece of paper or stored as a file on a USB flash drive.
In any case you really need to learn about how bitcoin is used and stored before you attempt to recover the funds as there is a chance you will accidently loose the funds in the process by getting hacked or making a mistake when recovering the funds.

And completely destroying entire companies like factom that rely on recording on the blockchain. 
So you are worried about decentralisation and node count? Well your about to loose all of factoms full nodes directly because of small blocks.
Keeping blocks small will not magically incentivize people to run full nodes. Full nodes will only be run by people who need them like devs and btc companies. Growing bitcoin to incorporate more companies and devs will increase node count, not destroying their entire business model!  Seriously
Floating blocksize. Keeps blocks small and also lets bitcoin breathe when needed. HF. Do it once and do it right!

By forcefully being held down, im refering to free markets unsure of its future, its a healthy mechanism, skepticism in trading...
And when talking about good news, im refering to the last 8 months of crazy good news being absorbed by a correcting market that still have yet to reflect positively on the price.. Its coming, and once the downwards trend breaks, its coming all at once and faster than you could anticipate..  
Correct me if im wrong but this is the longest downwards/flat period bitcoin has had to date.. So it wouldn't be impossible for it to therefore be followed by the greatest percentage gain hype cycle to date.
End of 2015 into 2016 bubble, followed by reward halving leading to two subsequent bubbles over the following 12 months after the halving.. that takes us to 100k a coin by mid 2017, just in time for bitcoin to showcase the products that have been built over the previous 2 years, and the public finally 'get it' .. 2017 is the year Warren Buffet says he likes bitcoin..

Yes my prediction is that we will have pullbacks on the way up, but we will not go below the previous ATH of $1350 on the way there. We both acknowledge that nothing goes up in a straight line. However i dont see us going below $1400 now until this bubble is over up in the multiple thousands of dollars per btc. Once it pops up at 6k 7k or 8k then we will most likely revisit $1000 eventually.
My prediction is basicaly that we will see prices alot higher than they are now (8k) before we go below $1400 again.

The small group of 19th century entrepreneurs who invented banking became rich in the process as they were providing a service that benefited the world at the time.. same is true with bitcoin and its early adopters, however, there are way way way more early adopters than there were owners of those early banks. And those banks went from making a few people very wealthy, to a system that creates money out of nothing and charges interest on it effectively transferring wealth from society to the financial sector.. bitcoin will make a few people wealthy but it will never do the latter as btc cannot be created out of thin air by the early adopters at the expense of the rest of society..  
Bitcoin overall is by far a much better and much more fair system for humanity. 
Also dont forget most early adopters lost coins or took profits along the way leading to many people being early adopters instead of just a few people who invented the technology.. and if u dont like btc just use ethereum as their distribution process was amazingly egalitarian.

Such a good opinion piece!
The only thing they failed to mention is the 3 previous bubbles had only a few nerds, a few libertarians and a few VCs buying coins.
This time around (thanks to the "blockchain" marketing campaign that took place over the last 3 years) every single mainstream investor, hedgefund manager and wall st trader knows what bitcoin is and the potential it holds.
It is not unlikely that this next bubble may be the biggest bubble by percentage gain we have seen yet, also that we may not crash as dramatically as previous bubbles.
In other words we may hit $10,000 and keep on running up to 20 or 30k. We also may only crash and consolidate by 50% after the peak instead of 80%
Just food for thought.
We have never had this much exposure and demand in any previous bubble in bitcoins short history.

Yes true but like I said the market has already fallen 65% this year. Betting that it will hit $100 or $10 or $1 is a very risky bet. Smart people do not short after a market has already fallen 65%, if they wanted to short they would have shorted latest after a 20% fall when it was first considered a technical bear market.
This is why it is my opinion that it is far more likely they long the market from this point or lower rather than short it. I may be wrong, just an opinion.

The difference being with LN i have to manually choose the channels to lock funds into based on what I want to buy.
Imagine using paypal, and to buy coffee you need to lock funds into one account, to buy groceries a different account, to buy electronics a different account again. That is not user friendly..
I will use LN once it is an automated seemless experience where all I have to know is I own bitcoin and can spend it anywhere without doing anything myself manually.

Hence my point: when mainstream investors use bitcoin even if only as a settlement layer that will actually have a larger effect on the price than them simply buying.
Buying for investment or buying to transact without even knowing it has the same effect. More scarcity vs more velocity.. either way the fireworks havent even begun yet.

The hash rate follows the price. If the price rises more people mine. If the price falls the unprofitable miners turn off their operations leading to falling hashing power.. so far the hash rate has been steadily climbing following the average yearly orice of bitcoin, with only short bubble periods where the hashrate does not follow the price into the bubble as it takes a long time to set up a mine. By the time you decide to set up a new mine the price has already corrected.
This will be true for entire time the bitcoin price is rising. The hashing power wont level off and remain long term steady until the bitcoin price has reached a stable value (much higher than where it is today) at which point probably every large corporation or company or bank who uses bitcoin will have an in house mining farm to make sure the system they depend on remains globally decentralised.

Buying bitcoin has been and still is a bet on the future, not the present.
Buying bitcoin represents an investment in the future potential of the network not the current potential.
People invest not based on what we can do now but what we will be able to do in 5 to 10 years time.
The blocksize issue is irellevant in this decision. So long as people can see what the future may bring with bitcoin they will invest now!

We have not hit your last point in the checklist. "New era".
No body thinks this is a new era, everyone knows it will crash as it has done before. 
This is just one mini bubble within a much larger master bubble. 
Can you even call something that recovers to previous all time highs within 12 to 36 months a bubble? Shouldnt it be reffered to as large correction and consolidation?
When the mainstream media are saying this is a new era it will be real bubble.
Today they are all still saying its a bubble. Or a joke. Or a scam.
This rally will crash hard but it will recover. The real "master" bubble is not here yet. Maybe by 2020.

You forget that as the price is rising it incentivizes miners to stop selling coins onto the market and defer as many payments as possible in the short term.
The amount of coins you calculated are not realistically going to be for sale on the market for the next few months. Miners will set aside the amount of money they need to pay outgoings and hold the rest during this incoming rally. Which inevitably means an overshoot in price. We may hit 20k or higher before crashing back to 2,000 IMO.
Realise im NOT saying that $20,000 is a fundamentally correct price. Im just saying there is a high possibility we massively overshoot in the very short term.

I can try.
Definition of capitalism: "An economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."
Important part being "private". It basically means individuals like you and me are the ones driving our countries trade and industry.
We cant build industry and conduct trade if we have no money to start a business or build a factory or import goods etc. Therefore savings have to exist first. And saving money requires an incentive. That incentive is profit.
So capitalism is a system where individuals -  driven by potential profit - start businesses. The more successful businesses a country has the higher that countries standard of living. Theres more money coming into the country from exports, lower unemployment, more money being made therefore more money for infrustructure spending, more places to spend your money and enjoy a nice lifestyle. Just overall a better place to live.
Capitalism is a system that incentivises savings. So to say capitalism is boosting consumerism is false by definition and ironic according to the post you are asking about.
If consumerism is on the rise then something is wrong with the capitalistic system that is being run. Capitalism is what naturally occurs when humans are left up to their own devices. Free markets in other words. So if something is wrong with your capitalistic system the only explanation can be intervention and manipulation within the system.
IMPORTANT: If you have a currency that is forced on the population and that currency disincentivises savings over time through slow insidious inflation, then capitalism cannot work effectively. You cant have a system that is supposed to incentivise savings when you impose a form of money that disincentivises savings.
Another point is interest rates. Capitalism cant work effectively when the price of money is manipulated or centrally planned. If interest rates are held artifically low for a decade then that disincentivises savings. 
Therefore if you have a country that uses fiat money and manipulates interest rates then capitalism cant and wont work. This is not a failure of capitalism it is a failure of governemnt intervention.
Capitalism can only work under a system of sound money and free markets. And when a country uses sound money and free markets then they have the most productive era along with the highest standard of living.
To answer your question, it is ironic that economists promoting infinite money creation and manipulating interest rates can say that consumer debt is a problem caused by capitalism (a system that incentivises savings). When clearly the problem is not capitalism, the problem is them promoting monetary intervention.

He has been calling bitcoin a bubble since 2014 at around $300.
He can only be proven right if the price falls below that level and stays there.
But you know peter. If the price goes to $100,000 and then crashes to $50,000 and stays there he will say "see I told you it was a bubble, I was right". Completely disregarding the fact he was telling people to sell bitcoin since it was $300.
This guy is a tool, all his arguments against bitcoin could also be used against gold, yet he promotes gold. This is what makes me distrust him so much these days.
Maybe one day once other blockchain use cases are mainstream he will realise this is bigger than he initially thought.
Peter if you are reading this, bitcoin is not just gold 2.0 it goes so much deeper than that! Look into Factom, and then ask yourself is a globally distributed, decentralised, immutable database (a single source of global digital truth) going to zero?

If a community of geeks and cryptographers mixed with a handful of venture capitalists made the price move up 7000x, what do you think the global financial industy and 5 billion people will do to the price.. give it another 10 years and I guarantee (if its not at $0) it will be that move of 7000x  multiplied by at least 100 which takes the price from .05 cents to $35,000. (7000 x 100 = 700,000.. 0.05 x 700,000 = $35,000 per coin.

My bad, confused bell curve with s-curve.
But regardless zoom that bell curve out and its a volatile bubble.
Zoomed-in 2013 looks like a gentle bell curve too. 
I guess the only difference is the percentage moves. A bell curve with a large percentage move is a bubble, a bell curve with a small percentage move looks gentle by comparison.
My argument is we will see just as large a "percentage" increase as 2013 if not more so. 
Edit: at the end of the day whats the difference. We both believe the price will rise alot then fall alot. I just believe it will happen fast and you believe it will happen slowly, hence the appearance of a soft bell curve.
Only time will tell.

@_date: 2017-05-16 09:55:50
LN is decentralised in its operation, and uses actual bitcoin. (Layer 2). It is built with the sole purpose of scaling.
RSK is federated not decentralised and uses a token on its own seperate blockchain that is pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. (Sidechain). It is built with the sole purpose of giving bitcoin ethereum like capabilities, scaling is just a side bonus.
LN can scale to thousands of transactions per second, while RSK can get us up to perhaps a few hundred transactions per second.
LN is a better solution for scaling but needs segwit. RSK would be more trustless if we had segwit but they will deploy a federated semi-trusted architecture now instead of waiting for segwit.
They are both extremely different technologies but both come with scaling benefits.
RSK will be a good short term scaling solution until we get segwit and LN. But then that begs the question why not just activate segwit now and get LN plus a trustless version of RSK. 
Blocking segwit is seriously hindering the advancement of bitcoins overall capabilities from many different angles not just scale.

Lets look at history. November 2013. After breaking above the $260 previous ATH we rallied to $300 - crashed to $270, rallied to $360 - crashed to $310, rallied to $445 - crashed to $380, rallied to $755 - crashed to $445, rallied to $870 - crashed to $750, rallied to $1163 - crashed to $805, rallied to $1144 - crashed to $550. Then proceeded to fall back to $150 slowly over the following few years.
Notice that after breaking the previous ATH of $260 we never went below it during that entire bull run.
We might get down to $1100 eventually. But we will see prices of $6,000 $7,000 or $8,000 first.
Just history repeating and cycles fullfilling.
Over the next few months (short term) we may see large percentage pullbacks and short consolidations but will be hard set going below $1400. This current bubble that has just begun will grow until we are very overvalued before we see $1100 again. Its the nature of this infant market which is bitcoin. 
Extreme overvaluation to extreme undervaluation and back to extreme overvaluation again. Infant market price discovery in action.

That may be the case for the U.S. but look at canada, australia, coastal china, hong kong, singapore. When the U.S. corrected these markets just kept on running even higher. Mainly because they had something going on that prevented their economies from feeling the brunt of the 08' recession. Next time around they wont be so lucky.

Healthy question. 
I do not believe people will be more incentivized to run a full node based on storage or bandwidth capacity. Full node count is decreasing because you no longer need a full node to send a transaction (SPV).
Keeping blocks small will have zero effect on this.
Full nodes will be run by people who need full nodes to operate, more or less devs and btc companies. Keeping blocks small will not all of a sudden make people want to run a full node without incentive.
More users and use cases leading to more devs and companies will increase node count. And that only happens with higher transaction throughput and the ability to cheaply record on the blockchain.
Why do you ignore the importance of users and use cases and growth in general.
Take this current situation as an example. A floating blocksize would let the protocol breathe and remain operational right now. Then once segwit is implemented the blocksize would reduce to around half a mega byte, then grow again over time getting back up to maybe 1.5 megabytes, then when LN is implemented it would reduce to around half a megabyte again. And that process would continue until we scale immensly and continue scaling. Ultimatly allowing blocks to remain small (and even shrink) while also allowing the protocol to breathe when absolutely needed.

Also, im sure when seashells where money in some ancient tribe the people would wear seashell necklaces, not because they were intrinsically valuable but because they were the money of the time and therefore valuable!!!!.. people don't value gold because of its intrinsic value they value it because it has historically been our agreed upon form of money, even to this day most people believe we use a gold standard for money (gold in the vault)!! but lets see that hold up when a better form of money than gold goes mainstream!!

I agree one day bitcoin will scale and I will be able to use it to send a friend $5 without paying more than 10 cents fee (because that transaction is not worth more than 10 cents to me) I just think it should make tiny tiny sacrifices to blocksize for a few months to allow scaling while remaining usable. A floating blocksize keeps blocks small while allowing room to breathe if absolutely necessary. 
If bitcoins block confirmation is its heartbeat, a floating blocksize limit would be its breath. It would rearely breathe but if needed it could take a breath temporarily rising the blocksize from 1mb to 1.5 for a few months before retracting back to 1mb once scaling is implemented

Yea thats true for purposes of inflation.
But im talking about bank runs.
If I deposit 10k in a bank, they then turn around and lend out 9k of that to someone else. They replace that 9k in my bank account with "bank credit". At this point instead of holding 10k in trust for me they owe me 9k. They have at that point turned an asset (my 10k) into a liability (they owe me 9k).
This works fine as long as I dont withdraw more than 10% of my account. If I do then they need to pay out using money sourced from someone elses deposit and they dont make money charging interest this way.
So if I deposit 10k and then send it all to a bitcoin exchange they are then stuck with money tied up in a loan while someone elses deposit has paid me out. This means they are making half of the profit they should be had I just left my money in the bank.
Withdrawing cash affects the banks level of vault cash. But wiring money out of the bank directly affects their profitability. The first scenario (if 10% of their deposit holders withdrew all their cash to buy btc) would cause a bank run and cash withdrawals would be blocked. The second scenario (if 10% of their deposit holders wired all their money out) would cause a loss in profitability and a fall in their share price. 
The second scenario would take 50% of deposit holders removing all their deposits to cause a bank failure. While the first scenario would only require 10% of depositors withdrawing cash to cause a bank failure.
This means that banks operating in cash based societies like india, africa, SE asia etc are more fragile to bitcoin, while western banks have more time but wouldnt be far behind. 
My post is reffering to the majority of the world that operates in a cash based society. This also explains the war on cash. Eliminating cash in commerce reduces the fragility of banks.

Just saying history doesn't dictate a long drawn out sideways move, it leans towards another bubble, also btc history shows in the 12 months after a halving (november 2012) we can ser two bubbles in a one year period..
So my delusionally optimistic conclusion is we will see another bubble by begining of 2016, then two bubbles within 12 months after the halving...
Just going by bitcoins history bro, as there aint much else to go by!
Also that makes sense, because most of the gains will be had before bitcoin goes mainstream as it always does with investments, and at this rate ppl will get bitcoin by 2017 with all the innovation due out by then.. So yea i believe the price will be alot higher by the time ppl get it, and they will get it by 2017, so the price will be alot higher by 2017, and that scenario i stated before is historically speaking how i see it getting there

If someone wants to create a ponzi using commercial property as the guise then they are free to. This does not change the fact that commercial property does return 8%-10% per annum.
You asked if there was anything that exists like this. This is one answer.
Lots of business want to run a business without owning the space they operate in for numerous reasons, so they rent. If I own that space and they rent it from me it averages 8-10% per year. A $300k office space rents for around $2k per month.

Ergo, segwit plus LN is a much better option than further centralising miners with a miner chosen blocksize.
Or put another way LN hubs are as easy to set up as a full node but with an actual financial incentive to do so (LN fees). So LN hubs will theoretically be more numerous than full nodes. 
Conclusion. LN financially incentivises decentralisation.

Utility is separate from value. Something can be intrinsically useful but not valued.
Oxygen is very useful to us human beings, but it is not valued. It is far too abundant to sustain a price. If you are under water and need an oxygen bottle to breath then it has tremendous value, but if you are on land in a clean country it is taken for granted and attributed no value becuase it is so abundant. 
In that sense utility, human desire and scarcity are what create value. Something doesnt just automatically have universal "intrisic" value because value is relative, all value is determined extrinsically. The term intrinsic value is a farce. Intrinsic utility is far more correct, and just beause something has intrinsic utility does not mean it will always be valued because of "the paradox of value".
I do agree that bitcoin is very useful for many people therefore holds intrinsic utility. Bitcoin currently has utility, human desire and scarcity which is why it is valuable.

One interesting thing is the 2013 valley from $260 down to $70 then back to $260 was 1 year long resulting in a 4 week rally to $1200. This time around the valley from $1200 down to $200 and back to $1200 was 4 years long, meaning this next potential rally could last 4 times as long as the previous rally. We could be running for 4 months now! $20,000 bitcoin is not out of the realm of possibility!

Lol where in that post did I say demand is irrellevant. 
If demand is constant at the same level and then you reduce the new supply by half this affects the price.
For example: if demand is a consistent $1 million per day, and the price has found stability at that level, then you reduce the new supply by half, that has the same affect as doubling the demand.
You need to study basic supply and demand my friend.

Gold is seen as the best jewellery because it represents wealth (money) people still have the perception money is gold (gold in the vault so to speak).. when a better form of money goes mainstream gold will loose value over time therefore becoming less drsireable as jewellery.. Platinum is more scarce than than gold, therefore as gold looses its monetary value platinum will become more valuable than gold due to simple supply and demand.. Future wifes will want platinum not gold because platinum will be the more valuable more rare precious metal! also silver is better at all industrial uses, so gold will be left as tooth fillings

From what I read they operate entirely on bitcoin since their inception and have only recently thought about using ethereum.
That unnecessary token is what powers their abilty to be decentralised. Payments (credit cards) on the internet have been the single most centralisng force on the internet. Now that digital tokens exist it makes sense to use them when creating a decentralised network like factom. Tierion looks to me like a centralised company using old school fiat money for subscriptions but claiming interoperability beacuse they anchor into bitcoin. 
Factom is entirely different. They are building an open decentralised platform for data integrity. Not a subscription based service that sends satoshis around the blockchain.

This is true for the 95% of people whos eyes glaze over at the topic of private keys and seed back up phrases. Most people will smile and nod agreeingly, and then lose their life savings because they forgot their passphrase for their seed or misplaced their seed entirely.
OP is correct, and it is frustrating, and he has the right to rant because he wants bitcoin to be easy to use but its not, and it wont be for some time. But one day someone smart will solve this problem and create a non-custodial service that hides all the complexity so everyone can use bitcoin safely and securly with ease, and the people that solve this problem will become the worlds most valuable service.

Its almost as concerning as sending $500 million worth of btc to the DAO. Its not just having to trust that they wont steal the btc. Its having to trust that there isnt some buggy loop hole that will drain 10% of all existing btc into a hackers wallet.
There has to be a better way than federated nodes. And one day it will be invented. Just not yet. One day we should look into implementing some sort of auto send feature that can be initiated by an incoming transaction.

I think this is the begining of an overdue massive rally and the halving will be the catalyst to fire it up.. and if you look at the rally from 100 to 1200 in 2013 it got up to its previous all time high of 260 then crashed massively before immediately recovering and running up 5x to 1200..
I expect the halving to kick start another big rally and then another massive short term crash before running to 5000 or more

Prices falling means everyone can afford more of everything. 
Wages do not need to decline. As a business, if your costs fall due to deflation you can pass that on to consumers by reducing your prices and still maintain the same profit margin without reducing wages.
Everyones wages remain stable while prices decline. Society benefits as a whole.

You do realise the only reason you need a loan for a new house or a new car is because of inflation.
It wasnt that long ago (pre 1950) when a new median priced car was worth one years savings and a new median priced home was worth five years savings.
Mortgages and car loans are not the norm they are the anomaly. 
If bitcoin was money again prices of goods and services would fall leading to a world where once again a new home could be saved up for in full in half a decade.
Banks can possibly provide bitcoin loans to new businesses who need large sums, but then banks become no different from angel investors and we already have a world of investors willing to fund startups. Ever heard of kickstarter? Also we dont even need banks to issue corporate debt, companies can issue bitcoin bonds on the blockchain directly.
High interest peer to peer short term credit should be all thats needed along with startup funding sites. 
The world will be a far better place without debt needed just to survive.

He claims hes not accepting bitcoin because bitpay just convert it and give him dollars.
He entirely misses the point that he wants the value thats held in bitcoin to be given to him, thats why he accepts it. Whether he turns it into dollars or not is irrellevant. As time goes by more and more people decide that they also want the value thats held in bitcoin to be given to them, initially people will convert to dollars but as more people accept it the need to convert to dollars deminishes because you can then use your bitcoin to buy things with it directly.
At some point in the future the act of converting back to dollars becomes pointless.

Russell 2000, nasdaq are in official bear markets. Faang stocks are all down 20% to 40%. Property is falling. consumer credit is rising due to zero savings. You think this wont affect consumer spending and cause a contraction?
Literally the only things that arnt signalling a recession are GDP and unemployment because they are lagging indicators not forward looking indicators. They dont get bad until a recession has already taken hold.
Also unemployment is a mute component, unemployment is only low because people who stop looking for work are not counted as unemployed, the correct metric to look at is labour force participation rate which is at its lowest since the 1970s. The reality is more people are unemployed now than 2008 and more people have resorted to part time jobs now than in 2008. 
If you cant see a recession coming next year then you are as blind as the fed was in 2007.
The neutral rate of interest (managable rate of interest) has been falling for 2 decades to where now the economy cannot handle the fed funds rate above 2.5%. Interest rates have had lower lows and lower highs for 20 years. 
A recession is about to happen with global rates at rock bottom and more debt than 2008. This is going to be worse than 2008 and all you can say is it hasnt happened yet so its not going to happen. Sorry but you are the definition of complacency bias.

It is an estimation based on apps time to adoption (10 years) like fb twitter etc. And large generational shifts taking 20 years like the internet itself.
Bitcoin is both a generational shift yet it is growing and used in the form of an app so call it 15 years.
But yes admitedly an estimation.
There is not much chance bitcoin stagnates around "sort of adopted by weirdos" for 50 years. It either gains mainstream adoption or fails until the world is ready for the next attempt. People just cant imagine it going anywhere in the next 5 years.
5 years is a long time in crypto. People always overestimate 1 year out but drastically underestimate 5 years out.

If the wealthy were to pay their fair share then there would have to be a tax reduction for the top 1%. The wealthiest pay far more total taxes than the middle class. Not only that, the wealthy donate way more of their money to good causes than the middle class. Also if you own a successful business you are taxed to death all while creating jobs for the middle class.
I agree that government should not be in bed with the few corporations it is in bed with. But as for the rest of the wealthy they are already hounded for far more than the middle class all while being the ones providing jobs for the middle class in the first place.
The wealthy create all the jobs, pay a majority of the taxes and donate more than anyone else, yet are criminalized as a whole because of a few bad apples. The ironic part is the bad apples wouldnt exist if government corruption didnt allow it.
All this criminalization of the wealthy is nothing but socialist greed. "Its unfair others have more than me so they must be bad". 
You wanna be rich then work 80 hours a week too. Risk everything to start a business too. Problem is 99% of people never will.
The problem of inequality is not caused by some people being successful. Success and failure is human nature, not something imposed by capitalism. Inequality is however exacerbated tremendously by inflation leaving a family that should be comfortable struggling in perpituity.
Capitalism and the successful are not the problem. Inflation is the problem.
Dont protest capitalism, protest inflation and government corruption.
Bitcoin is free market capitalism and invention at its core. Bitcoin is decentralised capitalism, Bitcoin is uncorruptable capitalism.

With gold land oil etc demand increases supply.
If demand causes the price of gold or oil to rise it becomes more profitable to mine therefore people mine it and supply increases. If demand for land increases more subdivisions are created and supply increases. These things have a supply response to demand, bitcoin does not.
No matter how much demand there is for bitcoin its supply cannot react to demand.
It is literally the only asset on earth who supply cannot react to demand therefore it is the only asset on earth whos supply cannot be diluted.

This is all about productive development.
So lets break the chart down into 3x eight year segments. The first eight years it seems like nothing is happening, the second eight years (which started 2 years ago) development explodes, and the last eight years it trails off. This is also the case for real world usage.
So over the next 5 years we will see amazing development (lightning etc) and amazing usage growth. Then the final 8 years sees mainstream adoption.
Its a long 24 year road but we are right now entering the most exiting time over the next few years during which we will see the most amazing development and real world usage. The first eight years (2009-2016) felt like nothing was happening, the second eight years (2017-2024) will feel like an explosion of usage and development, and the final eight years (2025-2032) will see us in a period of mainstream adoption beyond what we could have imagined.

35 ÷ 2 is 17.5 years. I say the internet speeding up adoption of internet based tech due to dissemination of information by double is a no brainer. The internet needed international cables and in home modems. All bitcoin needs is an app.

If there was a global power and internet blackout today all supply chains would break down, supermarkets would be empty, gas stations would be empty, banks and ATMs would be down, all global communication would be down, the global economy would be literally dead and people in cities would be starving to death. 
At that point your best bet is barter and scavenging. 
Bitcoin doesnt fix the problems of a possible global power failure it just makes the current system better.
With bitcoin or with todays system both leave us fucked with no power. 
However the chances of every coutry on earth losing power at the same time is basically zero even a solar flare only affects half of the planet. 
The benefit of bitcoin is so long as there are 2 solar panels somewhere on earth willing to run a node then bitcoin continues unaffected until people get their power back. That is not the case with banks.
The truth is bitcoin is far more resilient than the legacy financial system. And if you want a hedge for either system in case of a global blackout just become a doomsday prepper.

There are better sources than me when it comes to monetary policy.
But, it goes something like this. When interest rates are held artificially low by central banks this encourages people, corporations and banks to borrow more and speculate more than they should. This in turn causes assets to become over valued especially realestate, and once rates normalise (rise) those assets will deflate in value accordingly. 
So as rates rise around the world back to normal levels this will cause debt stress and forced sales of assets which will cause asset prices to fall.
I will buy assets after they have crashed, not before they crash.

Yea no shit, let the US keep their greenbacks, most of the rest of the world uses toilet paper for money and needs bitcoin.
Taxes dont change. Income tax, consumption tax, corporate tax. Its all still there and enforceable. The IRS can use bitpay if they want to recieve dollars, but for as long as inflation exists bitcoin will rise against the dollar. So perhaps keeping tax revenue in dollars instead of bitcoin will become detrimental. Also what happens when police officers and fire fighters dont want their salary in dollars anymore and start demanding their salary in bitcoin because of inflation.


Nope, interest rate manipulation by the fed causes the booms and busts your worried about. You think its a coincidence that shit is falling apart now right as the fed is raising rates?
Rates down causes a debt binge, rates up causes a debt crisis. The fed does this once a decade and people still cant see it. Sheep getting fleeced.

Inflation is only healthy if you believe that spending grows an economy. If your an adult and understand the only thing that can grow an economy is savings and capital investment then bitcoin is a far better way to grow an economy.
Spending can sustain a broken overleveraged economy but does not grow anything. You can only grow by allocating capital, and to obtain capital you first need savings. Growing an economy on bank credit created out of nothing is not real growth, it is pure inflation with a net zero benefit to living standards once purchasing power is accounted for.
We need real growth in living standards, not growth just for the sake of it with no benefit to living standards due to inflation.
Time preference can be low but never zero. We all die eventually so will always value spending money in the present over the future even when using a deflationary currency. All bitcoin will do is reduce the detrimental consumerism aspect of society while maintaining and enhancing real value.

This is very possible and extremely desireable.. and in my opinion the only logical way to solve this blocksize issue.
Dont worry though something like this will be implemented, its just a matter of time.
Core wants to hold off on any type of block size increase as long as possible so as to help keep the number of nodes high protecting the networks decentralisation but there will come a time where the trade offs are too heavy to keep 1mb blocks (if it isnt already here now).
But this will happen.
Also there will be no "large blocksize crisis", this solution you stated allows organic user growth on one side while segwit / thin blocks / LN etc lower block capacity on the other side effectivelly cancelling each other out. With all these elements in play I see the blocksize staying at a reasonable size through time well into the future.

They cant separte their transactions or smart contracts from the base layer whih means relying alot on sharding. 
With bitcoin transactions are the only thing we need to keep on the base layer. Micro payments and smart contracts go to 2nd later protocols. Making the base layer more robust and protecting the base layer from buggy smart contracts.
Overall bitcoins architecture is better for security of the base protocol.

Each seperate exchange uses their own trades in each candle. For example bitstamp will only use their internal transactions/trades to draw their candle. Bitfinex will use their own platforms trades to draw their candle. Thats why there is variance between all exchanges. All exchanges have short term variance but follow eachother long term due to "arbitrage".
The transactions happening on the bitcoin network have nothing to do with the exchange price or candles being drawn on their charts. The price is determined solely by traders buying and selling on an exchange. Services like bitpay use exchange prices to determine the value of the bitcoin sent and recieved at the time the transaction is made, they usually take a weighted average of multiple exchanges to determine the price of bitcoin they ascribe to a transaction.

Why did the gold standard fail.
Because of war. The US ended up selling europe everything for gold throughout the war. After the war America had all the gold and europe had nothing, so the dollar standard was created as a substitute to be as good as gold because it is hard to move gold around the world. Without the US dollar standard in place gold was not usable as most of the worlds gold was in fort knox and hard to transport, remember this is 100 years ago.
The gold standard didnt have to fail. Europe just had to work to earn their gold back and have the patience to wait for physical delivery. It failed in the sense it was corrupted and the US convinced the world not to use gold and instead use dollars.
Given the ease of transferability of digital assets accross borders this is not an issue with bitcoin.
In other words the gold standard failed because gold is fucking heavy and massively inconvenient to transport. Bitcoin is not.

Ether is considered gas for a revolutionary smart contract technology that is alot more complex than bitcoin. 
In a situation where you need to find a way to safe keep your life savings from disappearing overnight in a way that is out of the reach of governments you have 3 choices. Gold, US dollars, or crypto.
Gold is hard to buy in large quantities. You cant go down to a local coin collectors shop and buy a couple of 1kg bars. And then where do you store it? Under a mattress and pray you dont get robbed? 
US dollars are similarly hard to find on the black markets during times of crisis as people dont want to walk around the steeets doing black market deals with a suitcase full of $100 bills, and then the same question of where do you store them still comes into play. Plus one of these days even the US dollar wont be seen as a safe haven.
3rd option is crypto. Easier to source on he streets due to its digital peer to peer nature, and worth it due to the fact you can store it in your head, in a book, on your phone, engraved on the back of your oven. Etc. And then send it accross borders or take it with you accross borders effortlessly.
Now will it be btc or eth? Its possible it will be eth, but eth is viewed of as a tech gas for smart contracts. Bitcoin is made to be money and viewed of as money. In a time of crisis where time is of the essence and your life savings are involved, you choose the option that has the longest track record and highest reputation as store of value and money.
Bitcoin has proved itself as a store of value, ether has not been around long enough for that level of reputation and trust to take hold.
If god forbid venezuela goes to shit the masses there will find bitcoin through people in the streets doing peer to peer deals before they find and understand ethereum.

The only reason to use lightning is to easily spend btc. If you didnt need to spend btc you wouldnt use lightning in the first place.
It will go something like this:
Open a channel and fund it from your hardware wallet. Then spend that bitcoin, once your lightning balance is getting low top up the channel again. 
No need to ever close a channel, just continuously top it up with your spending money every so often.
Hardware wallet is your savings account, lightning wallet is your spending account. 
A cool analogy I like is your hardware wallet is like gold in a safe. And your lightning wallet is your debit card. 
No one relies solely on a debit card, we all have a savings account and cash. But imagine if it was easy to hold something as securley as gold in a safe and then easily fund your debit card with it. 
On chain btc held in a hardware wallet is like gold in a safe. Lightning btc top-up account is like a debitcard / daily spending account.

My theory is that if ethereum didnt exist bitcoin would have gone up more than it did. Somewhere between 5k to 10k. Ethereum stole bitcoins thunder based on uncertainty with bitcoins transaction delays and fees. People thought bitcoin couldnt scale and would stagnate so they diversified into ethereum.
So IMO even though bitcoin did rise it is still artificially suppressed (compared to where it fundamentally should be) and ethereum is artifically inflated in value simply because of unwarrented FUD regarding bitcoins scaling. This is coming to an end right now, which means theoretically ethereum should fall back to reality and bitcoin should rise to meet reality.

This article states bitcoin can not be analysed in the same way as gold and oil because there is no underlying asset. I disagree.
Bitcoins are an asset that allow you to utilize the benefits of bitcoin, in the same way owning oil is an asset that allows you to utilize the benefits of oil.
Therefore supply and demand is the only way to measure whether it is in a bubble or not.
Daily transactions are good to know as it gives insight into the protocols usage and subsequent demand. But as long as daily transaction volumes are artifically capped this doesnt provide the metrics needed making transaction volumes a useless metric. Once we have LN it will be even harder to find information about daily transactions.
I think the only way to use transaction volume as a metric to determine demand would be to take the most used coins like dash, eth etc and combine them all aling with the aggregate maket cap of them all. This would give a better overall picture, afterall these coins all trade in lock step long term. They all rise together and all fall together. 
This may work until LN and second layer solutions are used, but then its back to the drawing board again after that.
If you just want to look at bitcoin specifically then it might be better to simply use the market cap and hash rate or difficulty instead of txn volume, as hash rate is a better longer term metric for determining demand IMO

Who would be willing to sell bitcoin at $1? If it gets that low its better to just hold and call it a day.
All of the selling (if there is any) will occur between here and $500.
Capitulation will occur no lower than 80% from the highs. 
90% of people who own bitcoin know its all or nothing. No one is going to sell at a loss, and 90% of current bitcoiners bought above $300. 
The floor in an absolute worst case scenario is around $500. After that there will be no more sellers.
An upgrade to the protocol, no matter how messy is by no means a worst case scenario. 
If there is a chain split i predict a floor of $500 temporarily. If there is no chain split and segwit gets activated the price will see new highs.
Either way its better to own as much bitcoin before august 1st to make sure you have alot of coin on both chains.

True, scarcity alone is irrelevant. You need scarcity and utility. If you burned 10% of a currency every year that would be detrimental to usage and destroy utility. 
Bitcoin has scarcity which leads to store of value. Its store of value properties lead to utility. 
You cant make 10% of peoples money purposfully dissapear and think it will still be useful.
Bitcoin has utility because it is scarce, immutable, permissionless and transferable. If you took any of those properties away bitcoin wouldnt work.

South korea went from extreme poverty to economic powerhouse in 60 years. China did it in 40 years. All other countries could do the same given a stable uncorrupt currency to operate with.

Haha exactly. Every year the limit is worth less and less.
A great example is the amount of cash you are allowed to travel with. $10,000 USD. What if you are from britain where they use the pound yet keep the same £10,000 limit. Their currency fell 30% so now while they still have the same £10,000 limit that £10k limit is only worth $7,000 USD.
The whole idea of separate national currencies and forex is like currency barter. One global gold standard or bitcoin standard is the only solution.

Lots of small transactions are cumulatively the same as a few large transactions. It could be said that bitcoin used to have much more value transacted in dollar terms by alot of small transactions before those many small transactions were priced out.
Either way you look at it transactions are not a reliable metric to use because alot of small value transactions that used to be taking place on bitcoin no longer are due to the fact they are priced out of the available block space. This means we are currently experiencing less transaction volume than we would have been if there was no artificial transaction limit currently. 
Meaning if we had not hit the block size limit transaction volume would be higher making that PE graph look completely different.

Yep with peer to peer loans through bitcoin interest rates will be set by us through simple supply and demand.
When demand to borrow rises so do rates, this stops the economy from overheating and forming asset bubbles. When demand to borrow decreses so do rates, this stops the economy from freezing up and allows stimulation.
This is far more efficient and accurate than a bunch of old guys pretending they know whats best.

First off, all value is subjective. All value is based on utility and scarcity (a.k.a. demand and supply). Everything on earth that is useless and abundant has zero monetary value. Converesly everything on earth that is useful and scarce has monetary value. The extent of the value attributed is directly correlated to the level of utility and scarcity that specific thing has.
Bitcoin has utility and scarcity.
Utility because it is the worlds first immutable trustless ledger of account and allows permissionless censorship resistant transactions. This has never existed before and has huge disruptive potential.
Scarcity because it has a limited supply of units. This scarcity also helps develop strong network effects.
Its utility is hard to see because its not obviously used to its full potential yet. But by the time it is there will be no more money to be made.
Bitcoin detractors fail to see its potential utility and have trouble understanding digital scarcity. This is due to a lack of deeper understanding of the tech and failure to see how the world is moving forward digitally.
Bitcoin believers understand its potential utility and understand how digital scarcity is achieved.
The end.

Demand would need to grow but at a slower pace for the price to remain stable as the rate of new supply declines. This is a decline in the rate of demand.
So for the price to grow all that needs to happen is for the rate of demand growth to remain constant as new supply rate declines. That was my point.
You seem to think stable demand means no new people entering. Stable demand means maintaining the current level of new adoption.

Every country is pegged to US monetary policy. That is a more accurate statement.
If the US lowers rates and you dont then your exports are killed by a rising currency. If the US raises rates and you dont then your currency collapses (i.e. argentina turkey iran right now).
This is the price the world pays letting one country have reserve currency status. If the chinese renminbi was the world reserve currency and global point of strength and reference then the world would need to follow chinese interest rate policy in lock step also.
Look at australia and canada as an example. They were much healthier than the US in 2008 and didnt fall into recession yet had to lower their rates along side the US for the last decade to protect their exports from a rising currency. This fuelled an insane property boom which is now going to burst as US rates rise killing their economies.
Having one reserve currency controlled by politics is detrimental to all countries even allies of the US.
Gold standard or bitcoin standard are the only systems that work. Not US standard.

I like the fact that bitcoins alone are worthless. The thing that gives them value is the payment network they live in. So bitcoins are backed by the worlds first global permissionless trustless payment network (the bitcoin network).
Bitcoins are backed by the only global blockchain payment network that has become so successful it is having trouble scaling fast enough.
Scaling issues are a great problem to have. If we didnt having scaling issues bitcoins wouldnt be worth as much as they are today, simply because the demand wouldnt exist to create a scaling problem.
In that respect not scaling bitcoin will limit the price growth. But once scaling has been implemented the price can continue to grow with demand for using the network.
On a side note. Ether is backed by the ethereum network. It could then also be posited that dollars are backed by the united states financial system, haha I know which system im betting on lasting through the next decade.

So if there was no 1mb limit and transactions per second were growing higher, then this chart would show a higher PE ratio?  So the 1mb limit can make bitcoin appear as if its never in a bubble even if the price shoots up dramatically! Thats a bit stupid IMO.

Precisely. You dont give the bank your money to hold in good faith for you. You are a depositor meaning when you deposit money you are loaning the bank your money for a return in the form of interest. The second you deposit your money with a bank it is no longer your money.
Funny that becuase if everyone wanted their cash back at the same time banks would collapse. Thats highly similar to an investment scam that works until investors all want their money back only to discover the company has been insolvant for ages. Banks are literally fraudulent investment scams.

Bitcoin has no where near the liquidty of stocks or bonds, and there just is not that much traditional trading intelligence with current btc traders compared to traditional markets. So no it is no where near priced in yet.
After the first halving in November 2012 the following 12 months saw the price rise from roughly $10 to $1200.. 120x.. why wasnt it priced in then, because the btc market was extremely infant and illiquid (hard to get in and out of). And it is still extremely infant and extremely illiquid.
The next 12 months will be very interesting indeed!
The last halving saw a 120x rise that was not priced in and they had all the same information back then as we do today.. so far we have gone from a low of roughly 200 up to 700 (only 3.5x) take this into account and then realise this time around there will be less investible btc than after the last halving and higher demand than after the last halving. If you think a 3.5x increase is "priced in" with less btc available and higher demand this time around then you may be surprised as to what the next 12 months holds for you.
Last halving saw 120x increase. This time with higher demand and less investible btc it could be even more! 200x increase?? Who knows but if thats so then we have a long way to go to get from roughly $500 up to $100,000 (200x).
If the price was already $100k then I would say  it was priced in :)
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:32:17
If demand stays static while supply is reduced this will effect price. Supply demand economics is not a one way street. Both supply and demand effect the equation not just demand.
If demand fell along side supply then the price would stay the same.

It wasnt until 1995 or so that he finally sent a historical internal memo to his employees stating "get on the internet tidal wave". There are vast amounts of articles and such online showing this..

Gold is volatile right? $300 to $1900 to $1200.
Does that mean it was never used as money.
Volatility comes from two things, first, bitcoins nascent nature (as it matures its volatility measured in dollars reduces). And second, once things are priced in bitcoin it becomes stable.
The dollar is stable in milk and bread but insanely volatile against other currencies and commodities.
Businesses do not change their prices daily. So once things are priced in bitcoin that will bring stability.
All that will happen is bitcoin will appear stable as commodities remain volatile against bitcoin, then producers will hedge that commodity volatility the same as they do today when procing in dollars to ensure their shelf prices remain stable.

Obviously price does not cause high fees.
Gas limit + ICO transaction clogged network is leading to permanently unconfirmed transactions which is worse than what bitcoin is dealing with now  IMO. People paying $60 transaction fees to get their contracts operational.
Bitcoin as a base layer and rootstock as a layer 2 smart contract platform is better as it means smart contracts are not affected by congestion on the main chain. While ethereums smart contracts cant operate as soon as there is any congestion or gas price uncertainty. 
Bitcoins architecture separating complexity to secondary layers is a much smarter way to scale and secure the integrity of the overall ecosystem.

Since when did it become strange to use cash? What bullshit propaganda.
The big problem with placing a static limit on cash transactions is after a few years due to inflation that $10,000 will have the equivelant purchasing power of $8,000 then $6,000 the $4,000 etc.
Slowly over time as inflation eats away at purchasing power it will become illegal to use cash for anything more than a car service.
This does nothing but strengthen the potential benefits of bitcoin. These draconian dystopian measures are the equivelant of promoting bitcoin.

Bitcoin is programmable. Peer to peer lending platforms already exist.
The only way banks survive is if they become companies that offer crypto storage solutions that people want. For example a service that holds 1 of your 2-of-3 multisig keys to help you increase redunancy and require authorization to spend over your requested spending limit to make theft impossible. All while you maintain complete control over your other 2 keys.

Govt doesnt control the money supply, independant central BANKS do. 
A countries central bank is still a bank. Its a bank for the banks.
The free market used to set interest rates within the banking system via supply and demand of savings, and gold reserves were used to determine currency supply. Banks took these functions over once a central bank obtained the ability to print money unrestricted.
