They are in a beta phase, and not everyone has it.

This is a valid concern, which is why it is a major issue being addressed by the core developers. We're not there yet, but the protocol is still being developed. Lightning Network will be the next attempt at solving this issue, and there are more BIP's in the pipeline to make further improvements.

Gemini is good for this reason. You get the USD available to trade instantly, then you can't withdraw the BTC until the funds fully clear the bank.

Damn, I knew I'd regret not being Turkish one day.

I've been seeing mixed information on whether or not the futures markets need BTC to operate. If they do it could explain a lot of buying. I need to get to the bottom of how that works.

If you think in terms of market cap, there is plenty of room for growth. This allows the possibility of hundreds of thousands to millions per BTC. FOMO can be a real bastard, but there's still time to get on the train.

Two big ideas that have helped me hold during the dips are that almost every "crash" dropped the price to a point higher than before the bull run started. The other major one is market cap, there is still tons of room left for the price to grow as the market cap is very small relative to gold, offshore accounts, and other asset classes it has similar utility to. I hope you get another bull run in before a dip, being ahead makes it a lot easier to hold, but even if it dips below your buy in you'll be back to whole soon enough. Good luck, and try and enjoy the rollercoaster.

Sell high, buy low, or at least that's how it works in the frozen concentrate orange juice futures market.

I like using Breadwallet, but I’d like to see better fee options as well. My other issue is they don’t explicitly tell you what price you’re buying at until you’ve made the purchase. They tell you the amount of BTC and the fiat amount, and I can do the math, but it would be better to see the buy/sell price.

I just info dumped on my wife for over an hour. I couldn’t hold it in anymore. She is a saint for listening to me.

Yes, but that would be a rough ride. Every downturn would hard emotionally. Crashes are hard enough when you’re up and just losing gains, having all your money go up down sounds like a terrible experience even if you win in the long run.

I like being able to experience and observe market concepts in an extremely accelerated rate with crypto. Hodl is the major principal driving the financial independence community. Seeing crazy crashes, and major bull runs in a short period of time makes it easier to accept that the best strategy is to keep buying what you can afford, and holding the asset will continue to rise in the long term.

I bought a PC a couple of weeks ago to set a node for $85 at a electronics surplus store. You can save money by not getting a Windows license and putting Ubuntu on it. You could go even cheaper and still be able to run a node. I like the idea of nodes on Raspberry Pi’s, but I think that’s a little complicated and turns people off who would run a node.
