This is why ASIC resistant coins are doing so well.

It's working for ETH as ETH is successful.

I've read he said a 130mb block size would be needed for me adoption but I've never found a source, do you know if that's true?

I think one of the reasons it hasn't happened yet is that it's a memory bound algorithm, so a dedicated machine wouldn't be that much cheaper or efficient than modern video cards.
If memory prices go down so will GPU prices, so their cost will always be more linked than other algorithms/Asics. 
You're probably right that it'll happen eventually though.

I repurposed a few old computers to heat my apartment this winter. So far so good :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:45:13
Eth please :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:09:44
Buy coffee with ethereum, store value with BTC. :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:41:56
Some people do exactly that
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:42:32
And until it's ready I'll use eth for transfers when I can :)

You don't have to send your private key or anything that could be used to steal your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:13:42
Just for that I'm going to buy doge.

Defensive much? I buy Steam games with USD. I do exchange transfers with eth. I hold BTC.
Man you people, somebody doesn't immediately agree with you so you shout shill!

This is actually a really big deal. Breaking the psychological barrier is important.
