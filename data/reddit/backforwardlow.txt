I am a big blocker who disliked BU. It's not safe. I like Bitpay's proposed solution instead.
But we would not be here if Core stuck to the HK agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:34:09
These two years of debate have been about the blocksize; Segwit came later.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:38:22
Go and look up how the Hong Kong agreement was rejected by core devs. Therein you will find the names of the devs. BTW it's most of the core devs that reject it. HK agreement was also Segwit + 2MB.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:31:13
Yes they are but it's 2x which will cause the feud. The core devs will never accept 2x. We might get another split in the chain.
Bitcoin Segwit.
Bitcoin Segwit2x.
Bitcoin Cash.
Interesting days ahead.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:31:37


Not quite. Round 2: Core vs Segwit2x is yet to come.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:28:37
Also the November fight wont be about Segwit, it will be about 2x. It's going to make August 1st look tame.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:24:22
Some of the signatories of the NY agreement don't like segwit. To them it was a compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:50:50
BTW found the list :) 
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:19:42
For that to happen the miners would need to break their agreements. Which seems unlikely right now.
I do want to see only two chains because I don't see the point of 3. Except that 3 may kill the core/Blockstream project.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:12:45


You are suposed to be a big holder and never knew? What sort of big holder are you?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:29:07
They hold Bitcoin. They are allowed to do what they want with it, just like you aer allowed to support SW.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:47:55
Read what Greg Maxwell (the most influential core dev) said about the NY agreement. The first reply:
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:18:20
The whole point of that sub was to protest about this sub and Blockstream. It shouldn't surprise us if they do what they promised to do. This place at one point banned all talk of Bitcoin XT and that's why the other sub started. I am surprised that they have allowed all this discussion about BCC.
Yes now that there has been a split they will talk more about development. But this place will have Blockstream/core vs Segwit2x. The debate here is just gettign started.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:15:24
I think bitmain made a lot of money
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:54:41
Yes the 2x part is the hard fork. If they don't support it then we could have another chain split.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:19:48
The whole point of BCC was anti-segwit. Such a bad post that was!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:20
You know that isn't what I meant. That increase doesn't increase the size of blocks, it only allows for more transactions on blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:12:29
Name calling your own boss in public? I would get sacked for that.
Yes he is a great dev but I worry about Bitcoin's future when it's in the hands of messed up people. Then again Bram Cohen managed to make BitTorrent work even though he is a toxic dude. No surprise that he like the Core team.
CEO of Coinbase:
"Some of them show very poor communication skills or a lack of maturity — this has hurt bitcoin’s ability to bring new protocol developers into the space."
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:12:59
Remember he thinks it’s not the same network as before. Sw wasn’t there before and the block size limit wasn’t supposed to be in place for this long. So he isn’t attacking the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:18:37
If you sent it to an address you control, then it shouldn't be a problem. Replay attacks will send 2x to that address too.
The real danger here is if you send 2x to an address that you don't control. Then someone could send 1x to that address too.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:59:56
What does Greg Maxwell think about this?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:07:37
I can't speak for them but I know that there is way to much history for me to go through.
Seen this?
Now there is infighting among core supporters themselves. A pretty bad move from Theymos and Luke. We don't know how well tested his code is.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:23:13
One example: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:00:05
Bitcoin isn't that risky.

The guy who runs this place

I say wait until the price is x5 if you are worried about it falling or your wife making you buy a house.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:37:56
It's such a long saga that I don't know where to start. 
The three men (two core devs and one president of Blockstream) made an agreement with miners in Hong Kong to raise the max block size. Upon their return, Greg Maxwell was not happy with the agreement and said it would not be fulfilled. He is name calling them for making the agreement.
Other evidence of anti-social behavior from core devs is numerous.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:59:11
Non-technical readers won't have a clue. Why do my fellow programmers think that laypersons think like they do?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:00:19
It’s not contentious when core agrees.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:59:26
There were lots of transactions last week too.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:10
Give me the evidence. A single quote will do.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:16:06
Dunning-Kruger effect.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:47:04
It needs to be sooner!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:00:00
If you think core are not against bigger blocks, you have been sleeping for the last three years.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:59:11
I know what core wants. But it's good to be technically correct. If someone says core wants bigger blocks then they are technically wrong.
Segwit == more tansactions in a block
Segwit != bigger blocks
Yes it is a good day. The fork could have damaged the crypto market for a long time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:00:43
Lol do I even need to? It's so obvious. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:59:51
The network can't handle spam?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:59
I don't like Core mainly because of their manners. I can't see how an organisation of such toxic and messed up individuals can work well with the larger community. I know that Core isn't just LukeJr, Todd, Maxwell and Mow (yes I know he with is Blockstream) but that is my primary reason for not liking Core.
No I don't think we should have only a few full nodes on Earth but I also don't think we should have 1MB right now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:08:00
He is thinking long term. Remember Bitcoin once fell from 1200 to 170. Roger was promoting it then too.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:30:19
How long will SW take to really show a difference in block sizes? I suggst a max blocksize increase because it would be instant after a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:55:04


Thats is why we need block size limit increase before 2nd layer is mass implemented.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:53:16
True! Alts will win.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:28:32


Lol what? It isn't. I think you are confusing Saudi for Iran. 
Saudi Arabia may have some Islamic laws but it is mixed in with whatever the royal family want. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:45:09


He is not a bad coder. I don't know what happened with segwit2x. Why the code for that was messed up.
Yeah they are good coders but can an organisation be sustained with immature personalities. Btw I am not a big BCH supporter. I am anti-core but I don't think BCH is the answer.
Also I dont think you have been here long enough to know whats going on.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:53:33
I love this news. So funny.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:53:16
Thanks for the interview. I always wanted to know what trolls are like in person.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:35:45


Good point.
My biggest concern with SW is the complexity. However I guess  if it is throughly tested then we will have to see.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:52:03
I am talking about the max block size parmeter. Not segwit. He was refering to making that parameter adabtable.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:30:51
Let's not pretend that he is against a rise in block size. He even says he supports it later in the recording. Being anti-BU != anti-max blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:02:07
There is no one more toxic than the core group
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:16:48
It was inivitible. No Satoshi = no unifier. When Gavin took over he didn't want to be the leader and wanted things distributed. So here we are.
But I say may the best fork win. Now core and big blockers both get to try out their own vision.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:32:35
Thankfully I knew that block are every 10 minutes.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:43:52
Btw they don't like 2x just like you. I am a BCH supporter and I want to see no fork in November.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:10:56
Oh I see. I guess I misunderstood after all these years in Bitcoin!! I thought confirmations were full nodes with updated transactions. Wow.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:15:51
It is relevant. Hearn left because of 'core'.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:14:24
Have you seen the context? And Samson and Maxwell good manners?
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:33:56
Is this how you treat all people asking questions? "None, because it doesn't need to be stopped" - if someone didn't understand that then you just leave it at that?
I ask luke because he is anti the fork. A siginificant number of entities have signed to run the 2x part of the NY agreement. In this case a chain split is possible. In your answer you don't clarify if your are okay with a split (and you will support the non-2x chain) or you are okay with having the 2x increase. The lack of clarity is a non-answer.
I guess I didn't expect many on here to accept a split because of all the past warnings against a hardfork. In the past, even people from Blockstream met with miners to dissuade them from adopting other clients - but the mood in here has changed?
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:52:11
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:35:22
Why so rude?

No more like 1994.

P2p is not practical. I think it will be hub and spokes.
