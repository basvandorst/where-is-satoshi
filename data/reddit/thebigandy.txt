I don't have bitcoins, but if I did I would actually want a Ferrari, lol.

I have always like Porsche too.  I might get flammed for this but I like the new Cayman more than the new 911.

Well that's a $5,000 mistake.  Good news is that by the end of the day it might only be like a $4,500 mistake.

I'm no expert, by any means, but you can't send different type of wallet to wallet.

The way I look at it, if I had bought BTC at $10/Coin, there is no way I would have held to here, I would have probably sold at $100/coin (the math works at any price point to here, for me).  So I look at it knowing where I would have gotten off the roller coaster.  I am sorry for your loss man, I really am.

I don't disagree with it being fake news, but assigning it to a side that didn't exist then is leaping to conclusions.

I just ordered a TV with bitcorn, it was only 3.5 Cobbs!

Yeah a Pro Trump Blog about Australian banks before Trump was even running.  Sounds legit.

The crash is going to happen because I purchased them.  &gt;So you make a shitpost with a title firmly STATING that a large "correction" or "crash" is coming when you actually don't know that. You then continue to give some backstory about how you used to mine but got out, but now you're back in... wtf? Here, have a downvote. 
Crash is going to happen because I actually bought Bitcoin with Fiat.  I have always sold what I got from mining instantly, this is the first time I've ever held.

I did that on slushpool too, turns out I had like $60 instead of the thousands I thought I had.

It depends on which dimension you're in.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:39:04
Because I pulled the trigger and spent money on it for the first time ever, and I am highly unlucky, if such a thing exists.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:39:57
Lol, I hope you're right!  I'm just saying that with my luck it's about to tank.

Doesn't bitcoin mining use more power than a lot of countries? Oh wait it was just poor use of commas.

I am guessing that is due to the new alexa model, i have older stuff without mics so I am not that worried about it.  I don't even really use it anyways.

Oh okay, I totally though there was a way to use a Sonos bridge or something as a physical firewall, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:23:41
Sonos (the network speakers?) As a firewall?  Please tell me more...

My Challenger and Charger are both really roomy, I love them! (*Except the Challengers back seat, it's unusable)

I used to mine there with CPU only for a little while 5 years ago and had forgotten about it, signed in and got my $46.  I am grateful.

I can't really go buy a car or pay my mortgage with them right now, so not really.

Where do you exchange for gift cards?  (I'm new to all of this)

I have 719gb free on that drive, but what is pruning?
