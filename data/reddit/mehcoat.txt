I think with low valued transaction this isnt the problem. You could compare it with current money: in most shops only bills &gt; 100€ get checked with UV-Light or with a check-pen.
And in case with bitcoin, i guess 99% ppl dont even know them - and those who know them currently more interested in pushing the technology (hopefully)

Thx Coinabul for your initiative - just bought a VPN for a year for just 2.7BTC

[Shameless plug] My friend currently works on a really small alpin-hut, and I also will work there for about 3weeks. 
I persuaded him to try an experiment and also accept bitcoins. I would be very suprised if only one guest shows up who even knows what bitcoins are, and even not talking about paying with them. But who knows...
It is only open for three months a year and it started three weeks ago (the rest of the year it is too much snow there). So everything is open - very curios what will happen - if someone from the region reads wanna be the first bitcoin-customer on 2717m? :)

if this is a "golden buying opportunity" - why not you have just bought 2days ago (or any day before it)? There it was even lower :)

You can also make a Wallet on Blockchain.info (  ) and add all needed addresses as "Watch only". (Menu point "Import / Export")
Then you see the cumulative value of all addresses but you dont risk that someone can steal your private-key.

OldNews: I bought a Domain there about half a year ago - with bitcoins. And it worked flawless! Had the DNS-entry after about 2h after my first sign in there.

Was also my first thought.

Cool idea. Technically it could actually work like this:
* a clientside javascript generates a new bitcoin address 
* You send some coins there (lets say 10*equalShare)
* You have to wait, until they get in a block
* The javascript generates and signs 10 transactions with nLocktime in x-years
* But this wont get published, you just keep the raw transaction
* Afterwards you would have the option to forget the private key and lock the coins ultimately there, until the transactions get valid and someone publishes them
* Or you save the private key and have the option to spend them earlier 
So, it wont be provable locked, but would be a nice option for some Bitcoin-presents :)

No. Transactions with nLockTime are not in the blockchain. So if someone has the private key to the address, he can spend them anytime. With a new transaction, without nLockTime.
And I see no provable way to destroy the private-key. So that someone, who gets their equal share can be sure, that the share will be there, waiting for them.

Blockchain.info waits about 2-3 days on open transaction until it gives up and allows you to spend the funds again. I dont think there is currently a way to speed that up (except support, i guess)

Cool - just ordered something from your site. Looking forward to get it shipped nearly across halve the globe :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:33:21
PSA: If you use the blockchain.info wallet app on android and can not make payments, because the server is down: it has a peer-to-peer mode where transaction can be published without the server. Just activate it, if needed in the Context menu in the main screen.
It saved my ass once. (not literary)

Just a quick note:


The "last one" actually will never be mined - the miner reward halves every ~4 years. This means the total amount of BTC will never reach 21millions, but it gets asymptotically close.
Slightly related: by implementational decisions it is also impossible to spend "the first" 50bitcoins from the genesis bock. They exist, but afaik it is impossible to spend them.

The site really looks good and it seems you/they have put a lot of effort into it. 
But I personally would never trust a site to hold my private keys - especially when there are alternatives out there, which provide the same features and dont need the private key.
Also there is no personal backup possible. There is a recovery phrase, but this is nil, if coinjar disappears.
