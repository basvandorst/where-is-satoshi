honestly, its absurdity is up to a point. 
think about it, if you have a moment.
there is a great deal of everyday tasks, which do require a certain level of coordination, but this level is really not that high. the moment our technology is able to replicate it consistently, the need for these tasks to be executed by a human being becomes obsolete. think cashiers, drivers, lower level jobs which require knowing something, but simply applying it. lawyers, for that matter, would not be that needed in not too distant future, when it comes down to simple cases with strong court history. 
only really high degree of abstraction jobs would still be applicable, if AI continues to develop in present terms (and it probably accelerate) - photography, art, things like these. but are these the fundamental structure of industry? no, and they never had been. 
when we have automation in the basics of our needs, why not give basic income to people, which would free them to pursue what truly defines them as a human being?
this is really not about politics, honestly. this is an opportunity that has never existed in our history as a species and is an interesting thought to contemplate on. Arthur Clarke did it in the "Childood's End". decades after, doesnt it ring truer?

past performance is not a reliable indicator of future trends. (this goes both ways) 
this time there are a lot, lot more people involved in the community and the bitcoin idea, plus it's becoming more and more interesting to serious financial institutions. 
the conditions as of now are not similar to those back in 2013 and while it's true history repeats itself sometimes, to me it's not a sufficient factor to think the pattern will be similar now.

Mercury's retrograde, should explain all.

do not sell. if scared, don't look at the current price.

AUD, obviously. 
still, would like to see more on the topic. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:22:55
I think more opinions like these are needed around (phone or not). It is exceptionally interesting and bringing clarification a lot more than the basic concepts thrown around. Thank you!

with all the big news as of late, with CME, nasdaq opening futures markets, which are cash settled, I stumbled upon this article and wondered what you opinion is on the possible longer-term outcome on the bitcoin price. in my eyes it looks an equivalent situation. you thoughts?

Bulgarian here, I'd love to free my country from all the burden, if it is indeed wise enough to dump the price that far. 
Knowing the way our ruling party operates, I wouldn't even be that surprised.

Not this one only, most of them resumed operation. But still not taking back transfers though.

this is actually pretty scary news. 
according to this chart, bitcoin could very well not be on fire soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:41:06
they absolutely will, perhaps even more severely. 
for the time being and for some time in the future, bitcoin is the cryptocurrency's face and bitcoin crashing would mean a crash in all of the alts inevitably. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:45:26
correct me if I'm wrong, but when more and more futures markets open up, CME being the closest, this will be more and more difficult to do, since more big guys with an interest of their own will be in the game, hence - more riskier to open such positions?

the problem is that the way things are now, it is always exceptionally dangerous to short bitcoin. you really can't be sure of anything at this point and the odds are you're going to get burnt rather than win a conceivable amount. 
i've been considering the same, but honestly I think the best way for an average person is to just sit tight and weather the storm. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:04:58
Personally, I'd wait on it. Should recover soonish, based on recent support levels
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:00
This is very interesting read, thank you. Looking at the support in favor of increasing block size from different entities (second article), it actually looks like most of them were in favor of increasing it, Andreas included. How come?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:29
They can't win. Even they know it. They are just milking what's possible for them to milk until Bitcoin implements its new functionality and make this alt obsolete.
Efforts should be made towards constructive development rather than attacking. Attacking is а short term profit. In the long term bcash has literally nothing to offer

In terms of security a hardware wallet is the way to go, if you plan on keeping a larger sum in crypto. 
Personally, I think the Ledger Nano S is probably the best way to go for the moment, if you take into account price/supported cryptos/.
