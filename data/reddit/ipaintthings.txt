Hi, no that was a one I used for that image. I think its a standard wooden frame. Its Printify that handle the fulfillment of the orders. They could quite easily be framed in a similar style if taken to a local framers. Many thanks
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:25:32

Yup, have done. terrycookpaintings.com
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:27:51
Yeah, I do loads of that for portraits. I've never seen anyone not use some kind of informal measuring and get truly accurate proportions. A few years ago my father wanted me to paint the Girl with the Pearl Earring for him. I filmed it. At the start you can see that a large part of it is just measuring and trying to get proportions accurate.

Hi there, 
In the next few days I'm going to put it on my site for free download. You can order a print from the site that covers the cost of printing only (no profit to myself). Or if you want an original, get back to me and we can sort something out. Thanks

I recently sold my Ethereum painting at the Codex Protocol "Ethereal" event that was held for charity.

I give away my art work for free on my site for people to print or do as they please. I sell the originals too. This one was a print and not a painting though. I normally work with ink and watercolour. If you go to [ you can download the files or buy a framed print. The cost pretty much just covers the cost of production, I'm trying to make it as "possible as possible"  for people to own cryptoart :) I haven't got this one up yet but will put it on this week, along with some other I need to get on there. Thanks
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:09:48
Did think about that :)
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:10:47
I hear you . Its just the title of the piece. Not a reflection of my opinion 
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:46:46
Yeah it will be going up on my site soon for free.  Terrycookpaintings.co
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:09:24
Cheers buddy :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:04:43
Im going to pm you a link to my fb page. Hopefully you'll be convinced then. I have videos and such there.
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:00:19
