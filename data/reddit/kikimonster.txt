Currency wasn't even a goal for almost 10 years, it was already one. All of a sudden it can't function as a currency and you move the goal post 15 years that it might become one again. Currency is the function of all COINS, physical and digital.. I wonder why it's called bitcoin, not bitgoldbars.

Have  the liquidity to be a central hub, and take tx fees. They may not have custody of your funds, but you still have to preload the channel like a bank account.

Adoption is probably the most important thing. What good is bitcoin if I can't have my elderly neighbor download a wallet and send her some coin. Or for her to pay me for something I help with. Lightning network doesn't help this.

Then do everything on chain and you never have to worry about being online...

Why do you have to force? If it's so good, then people will use it, not the other way around.

It might fill and a be a problem in years. But why introduce a new product while the problem is happening now? LN only looks tempting because of the high fees, but why not introduce LN while fees are pennies and people have a choice. Right now the fees seem intentional, and one benefit is that it drives up demand for LN.

Is it a problem with the people if it's too complicated?
Just like in game design, if someone doesn't get it. It's the fault of the designer, not the player.

You have to always be online, and you have check in your funds into a payment channel. Instead of broadcasting to the network to include your transaction in the blockchain, you route your payment through nodes. LN is also vulnerable to any network attack vectors that affect meshes with centralized topologies compared to the bitcoin network's graph all to all topoology.

? That's not the definition of balance I used. But you clearly understood that from your second paragraph.


Was this a copy and paste? I don't really want to discuss with anyone who wants to twist my words.

Why would I need private keys? I just need an address...
I'm not making a paper wallet.
This is like the farthest thing from a scam. I'm offering people an extra option of accepting money.

CentraliZed routing table? There is no routing table, everyone is connected to everyone on the bitcoin network. It's a gossip protocol. It's a small world network, it doesn't resemble tradition networks at all.
The internet is not trustless. I am a network engineer, the entire network is made up of routers broadcasting "Hey everyone! To get to my network, come this way." And the service providers have to manually input what routes they accept from you or not, just as you have to manually input what routes you want to advertise to them. It's the exact opposite of a trustless model. Everyone is cooperating and everyone is expected to cooperate.
The global routing table is a statically assigned cooperative initiative.
The whole revolution of bitcoin was that it was completely trustless.  Revolution implying something that hadnt been done before.
This is not the results of a trustless infrastructure. It also contains a decent explanation of routing protocols, using a similar explanation to mine.

Yeah he's a douche and I misremembered his talk. The point of it was talking about pis though.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:16:53
Im saying "it works like the internet, trustlessly" is bullshit because the internet is not trustless. It's a marvel of human cooperation.
And the centralization is an economic force, not a technical one. Technical too, but the concerns are economic, it's built into its functioning.

It takes a lot of serious money to run a lightning hub. Right now there isn't any money locked up, but what makes the most sense is that connecting to someone with lots of connections and liquidity will be the cheapest way to route your payments across the network. How can most people afford to be a hub once people start putting in over 1 BTC per channel.
Even with just 20 people, you probably need at least 100BTC locked up. It's going to centralize even further.

Facts aren't important. Faith and interpretation are what matters /s

I can't even begin to understand the logic of the 2nd paragraph.  Why should anyone use it then?
Your idea of balance is to prevent them from making a lot of money, we have to leave them open to having money stolen from them. This isn't paying a fee, or spending your currency. This is reliant on blackhats protecting the economy with stealing. I'd almost call that trusting thieves to protect the network. "It's ok that it's broken! It prevents hubs!"
The internet is not centralized..... it's decentralized, but not trustless. Not one organization controls the routing table, and I think a lot of the earlier DNS centralization issues have been resolved. The internet is made up of a hodge podge of providers, cooperating. BGP is the language they use to cooperate. Each provider makes a decision on which specific blocks (subnets) of information they are willing to accept from the other provider. 
This is why I liked learning about this earlier in my career. You kind of just throw packets into the air and hope they get there and everyone has their shit together. You can only control your piece, and you are reliant on others to do the same. In most troubleshooting, you just find the last link you can control, and call the next guy. I'm actually currently mind blowned that I've gone down this path. This is how all internet problems are fixed. It's a constant stream of calling the next guy.
I would also argue that a bitcoin transaction is trusted. It's the communication between nodes that is trustless. As a user you trust that the transaction will be picked up and processed, and you have to trust your wallet is legit. The consensus mechanism is trustless.

No, that is not the same thing at all. That has nothing to do with the data stored on the miners, the "routing table" as you say.  The miners have the information of who they connect with, their IPs. They don't know what the global routing table is nor do they need to. 
Lol static routes, not trustless.... by definition you have to trust static routes because a human had to make input on it. But this has no bearing on the discussion, just to highlight some fundamental misunderstandings you have.

He never said that... he said if you want to run a node on a 25 dollar pc, you can piss off. No where does he describe a $20k pc. He described a fairly midrange 400 dollar pc. Quad core, 16 gigs of ram, a few TB of storage.
The high end example was just for large miners. Who aren't going to care if it's worth it:

Yes, there is a balance of letting inflation erode the value vs deflation making people not spend.

Thanks for the warning. That was a close one.
