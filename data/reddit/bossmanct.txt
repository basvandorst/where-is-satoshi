What are you pointing at?
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:03:37
Did the terrorists all take a survey? Lol
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:26:52
I’ve never snorted Coke with a rolled up bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:18:00
And buy
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:50:03
Pretty bad
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:58:15
Welp, this will stop some people from selling, so we will hit $1,000 ;)
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:55:30
Is this your promo code?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:58:37
I may buy some more when Coinbase comes back up!
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:36:57
We could call them Benny's 
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:49:42
Because of the fees I assume? I'm new here 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:42:23
I belief! HODL!!
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:49:29
hodl up. You intend to act like a gentleman to prove what now?
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:09:23
Simple. Buy, then Hodl. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:38:33
I just bought my first bitcoin today as well :) feels good, looking to buy more when my bank info verifys through coinbase

@_date: 2016-12-22 10:17:30
Ahh, thank you for this valuable information!

Ahh thank you for the info!
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:49:03
3-4 days to verify, but you can add instantly with a debit or credit card
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:36:36
Pack it up fellas, it was fun while it lasted.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:24:43
Alright, thank you very much for the help Lotus, I feel safer already. lol Especially since i plan to make some heavy investments into Bitcoin. Thanks again
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:48:16
Do you have a crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:26:17
understood, could you recommend elsewhere then? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:47:34
Oh yea, I remember that now, I watched a documentary about it earlier but kind of forgot about it. Hmm, I guess it would be a good idea to get a software wallet then. Would Electrum let me transfer my Litecoin over as well?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:13:20
I don't have bread wallet, but I Love this feature in iOS 11
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:07:24
I would retire at this point
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:24:14
New people, DO NOT SELL. this is normal. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:57:29
But I can send Litecoin to Electrum, not just Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:46:16
Use this —&gt;   /s
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:36:28
gotcha, I guess in a way, this is mostly reminding my self not to sell out, because of my mistakes doing this in the past. But yea, i usually avoid giving people financial advice. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:19:09
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:58:29
Funny enough, I'm in my early 20's. Lol but I'll take that as a compliment of wisdom
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:30:37
don't be a beggar 
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:11:29
I don't think it was wise to sell, imo
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:11:54
Alright I got both Electrum Wallets set up, got the physical keys written down and i'm storing them in a safe. Is it still fine to buy coins from coinbase and transfer them over? Or is there a better way? Also, in electrum, does the software let me know how much the coins are worth in USD, or would I have to just do the math myself?
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:34:56
Thank you, I have both variants downloaded now. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:05:13
Did you sell?
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:03:10
Because I have become comfortable with coinbase. I can buy there with my checking account, just not my debit card.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:19:56
I will look into that later. I just want my coins to be with the coins I have already purchased for now
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:03:31
I don't know, just speculation from past experiences.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:18:47
I called them 3 times, it was a hold on there end the first time and now they are telling me it has something to do with the merchant. Everything's verified, my bank has no hold on my account, and it gets cancelled. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:48:27
I like this
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:52:08
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:36:34
Could some one ELI5 this to me? What is short covering?
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:46:54
I panicked the first time as well and sold. I regret it very much and have recently bought back in. Buy in, dont touch!
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:31:01
don't sell, this is normal.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:40:09
how did you lose them? Did they close your account?
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:21:46
Makes sense
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:22:57
you can sell instantly to paypal on coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:14:32
Then yes you did lose 8 grand, if you wouldn't have sold, you could always bounce back
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:27:45
I've purchased and sold instantly to my paypal with no issues.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:35:48
Good guess
