How come sending for example £500 will result in a £15 fee and sending £1000 will result in a £45 fee. I've known it to change a bit but by 3x?? It's actually cheaper to send multiple smaller amounts for some reason too. It's never been like this. I'm using Airbitz too which was recommended a lot just 6 months ago when i was looking for an android wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:49:44
Google it then. It basically makes transactions smaller so more transactions can be processed at once(higher tops) so it costs much less to send something. So before if it was $10 to send something this might make it $6 for the same transaction at the same time. If everyone used it then fees should drop quite a lot for a while.

Airbitz just has the custom feerate which is normally do a custom fee. Might just leave it for a bit to see what happens because i'm sure it's not normal. Will just have to split it up as a last resort. Thanks though.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:44:37
Yeah I know about the fees per byte part and actually often use the custom fee option but i've never seen it quite this bad. Why would the transaction suddenly be 4x as large? Makes no sense to me. I would have thought the size would be similar the whole time, like if sending £1k a couple months ago was 300 bytes then why would sending £1k now be over 1,000 bytes?
Fees per byte going up i can handle and it makes sense, but the amount of bytes going up by several times doesn't seem normal. Being quoted $100 fee at 500sat/byte is insane.

Might as well be if we're paying the same taxes on all gains.
We're paying taxes right? 0_0

I got tipped many years ago on here, I actually saw it kinda often before it died down. I go tipped like $10 which would be worth like $500 now, I bought Factorio with it instead when the Dev used to sell it only on his site for $9 or so.

iYeah this is my main problem. Even if you don't tell anyone how much you have, even if they target you just for knowing you have any Bitcoin, what do you do when they hold a knife to your throat and tell you to open your Bitcoin wallet and transfer the contents to their address? You're gonna have to do it right? Even if it is $1k or even $100k+ you have to.
With a bank it won't happen, plus you'll most likely get the money credited back to you too, whereas with Bitcoin(or whatever) it's gone forever. No chance of getting it back. It's one of the biggest future problems imo.
Whats the solution though? Only one I can think of is to have a day to day wallet which only contains $100 max at all times whereas your main one is kept at home on a different device, but then what if people break in and ask for everything? A solution to that is to maybe have them stored with a secure cloud wallet provider that holds your coins and then automatically tops up a daily wallet for you to $100 or whatever, and if you want more you have to call or whatever to verify to transfer to your daily wallet, like a bank. Hate on banks all we want but I know my money isn't gonna disappear and i can't lose a device that holds it all, so a middle man crypto bank might be needed for some people for their savings if they don't trust themselves with a device with every penny of their life savings.
I've heard of timelock bitcoin transactions but can't the thieves just make them send the coins without it? I don't know much about that though tbh so that could just be the simple solution i guess.

How can I buy on the dip if there is no dip?? Ugh.
Figured I'd wake up and it would drop below 6k from 6.5k.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:40:14
Do transactions expire? If not then i could forget about it for a year then suddenly have the coins taken when the transaction finally goes through? The coins never get stuck unuseable in limbo do they? as in i can just use them elsewhere instead and let the low fee transaction get rejected by the time someone gets to it
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:09:53
I can send any amount of money to almost any bank account in my country almost instantly or free, big non crypto banks is a winner?
We can all chery pick. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:06:57
24 hour change, +64%... lol. Probably the worst proof of a failure ever :p Until the percentage increase is in single digits and then 0 or negative then you can repost what it looks like then.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:38


I was wondering that couldn't you just transfer your coins to another wallet, the transaction would be replayed on the other fork this time, but then any transactions from there should be fine right? Since they should be scrambled up to different parts of their respective chain, right? I'm not too sure how it all works and i could be totally wrong though, but it just makes sense to me that the coins on different chains can't keep following each other around.
I bet i'm totally wrong...
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:26:21
Well then they won't get the keys from you and you'd be dead and they'll just move to the next person. Hardly a win situation for you, sure they didn't take your coins but you can't use them when you're dead. That's all assuming you make it through torture lol, it's easy to say you'll cope through it when you don't think it's gonna happen to you.
People already break into houses for money. If they break into your house and say they're not leaving until they see a coin wallet on your phone and one on the PC or wherever and then have the funds from both transferred to them then what? You think you'd rather die than handing stuff over if they were really prepared to go that far?

BCH drops - "BCH is failing!!"
BTC drops - "You're being short sighted, we're still up for the month!"
Then the reverse happens in the Bitcoin Cash sub lol.

Tbh hearing it compared to the world's currency just makes it(to me) seem like it's not gonna go up many multiple times more now. 1% of the worlds currency seems like the near end of what a single cryptocurrency will be worth. Would be nice for it to hit $100k I guess but hmm, i dunno.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:51:27
As in you just bought 5 whole bitcoins within days of each other, which totals to like $25,000, without telling your soon to be wife? Ouch
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:48:42
I think most of us panicked but we held out. I was panicking but still bought more... This is bad for my health lol.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:27:32
Hopefully! I slowly Invest in Bitcoin since I can't just buy a lot like some people so a slow steady rise is the best for me, huge spikes like this just make me nervous. A drop to $6k even just for a few days would make me happy enough. Big random jumps aren't good for anyone apart from those that have like a hundred coins and are just living off of selling them slowly.

He has bad work ethics apparently. Like mandatory overtime up to 60 hours a week was normal and he is against unions and stuff. SpaceX employees are also apparently paid quite shit for how long they work and for what they have to do, SpaceX also lost a class action lawsuit and had to pay a few million to workers that were being underpaid, so it's not just made up.
So yeah it's not all good stuff and it sucks to treat employees like that, especially spacex employees. 
It's the same deal with Amazon, awesome company at what they do and they're awesome for their customers and stuff but working for them absolutely sucks since they don't treat their employees well.

Geez just looked through the list and there are 9,000 addresses with over $1million worth of BTC in them...
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:44:26
Why would people criticise them for being in the red when it's just because they're expanding infrastructure with the money? Is anyone actually citising them?
It's like where Amazon almost never posted a profit, or barely did, because they were constantly spending the money on new warehouses or new services. Nobody thought they were doing bad, how could they be, just look at them.
Once Tesla has finished building its Gigafactory and can make 10k model 3s a week, and whatever else they're building atm, their profit will suddenly jump to the 100 millions/billions. They're making no profit now because it would be dumb to, not just because he's being nice.

Why does he need to do it every time? Just doing it successfully 51 of those times will have him out on top(depends on how much the gains and loses each time were, yeah yeah).
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:39:50
But that doesn't let you deposit UK pounds so there'd be conversion fees and stuff. Seems like a bad place to solely use at a glance.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:23:43
It doesn't sound like it's positive about increasing the block size or keeping it the same
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:25:50
I thought people generally used Localbitcoin in the UK. No fees at all since you do instant UK bank transfers via your bank app(as if you're sending your mate money). The sellers exchange rate isn't as good though which is the catch. 
I thought it was the normal recommendation in the UK and I've done a few small trades over there between now and 3 years ago. Should i be buying elsewhere?
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:59:27
I agree with your concerns and I hate that this sub is pretty much an echo chamber of positive things and even in this thread people aren't answering your concerns or are just brushing you off as just trying to cause drama...
Quite simply compared to my bank bitcoin doesn't compete if you're sending less than a couple hundred $, it doesn't even at quite a bit more than that, so how's it gonna go fully mainstream? 
I want fees to be lower and transactions to be quicker, and you're simply asking whats being done to achieve that right? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:22:57
Back to the $1k bitcoin days?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:38:55
£40k a year will always just be £40k a year though. It might be good now but in 20 years with inflation it won't be worth anywhere near as much. At least with rent it'll follow close to inflation so in 20 years you may be charging double the rent and be getting £70k a year. Plus the houses would have at least doubled in value whereas putting the £1m in a fund will always be £1m if you spend the return each year.
Property easily sounds like the best choice to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:07:31
On the other hand almost all the banks in my country allow you to send money instantly to almost any other bank in the country with 0 fees at all. Just open your bank app, select your friend from your contacts or type in their number and the amount you want to send, then within a few seconds they'd have it with no fees. Literally can't be beaten.
Bitcoin is never gonna be good enough for standard normal low value transfers that need to be confirmed instantly by the sound of it, just large transfers that can take a while, it's too limited. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:15:15
It's probably a 5% fee AND a pretty bad rate. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:54:11
The game Factorio back when it was only sold on his website. It was about $10 at the time, I think I paid about 0.15 bitcoin for it.. Over $700 currently lol. It's probably not feasible to buy $10 things using bitcoin anymore.
I don't think most people on here have actually bought anything which is sad. Steam accepts it. Putting bitcoin in circulation will do more for it than holding everything. Just buy more to compensate for what you spend. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:00:00
Oh man this is like the first time in ages I've heard anyone say that on this sub lol. People aren't being realistic here anymore, nobody backs up what they're saying. It's just all still "it's still early to jump in, it's gonna be worth $100k a coin just because!!". It's already mostly proven that it can never be used as a normal every day currency, such as to buy coffee, so people have to rely on it being used as THE large volume trading currency(which is what it's good for) otherwise It's gonna lose it's only appeal and it's gonna crash when people see that right?
Cryptocoins have a scary future.

With £1m in the UK(any anywhere really) I could easily retire. You don't just treat it as a pot of money you just take from for the rest of your life, you just invest it and live off the monthly paychecks. Then later in life you slowly take from the pot while also getting the monthly(slowly decreasing) income. 
Like even if you go the housing route and buy 2 houses for £500k each, they'd rent out for close to £2k each a month, but let's say £1.5k each after all fees. That's £3k  income from rent a month, every month, and it'll constantly go up as the house price goes up. 
That's £36k a year which is muchhh higher than the UK average and therefore you can retire happily at any age from the £1m. Then when you're 60 or so just sell one of the houses(now worth £1m+ itself) and just have fun with the money.
I'd be happy with that and will just go on to do good things I'd like to think.
I don't understand how anybody that reaches £1m in cash can ever go bankrupt, it's just irresponsible if you do. Like when you hear about basket ball players that once had $10m in cash suddenly declare bankruptcy? fuck off with that, they're idiots.

It's not like it's easy to move to the US either, even from the UK,seemed really tough when i looked. Most countries are harder to move to than they should be.
