Based on the hint I tried Oscar for best movie, actor, writing and no luck. I thought about blackjack but don't see how it helps (using the additional digit in the dates as a card number w/ 11 as jack, 12 queen, 13 king and 14 ace ).

The fact that the maximum additional digit is 14 and the hint makes me think of the blackjack rules. I tried grouping dates by cumulative adding the additional digit until you go bust. but that didn't seem to go anywhere.

I thought about the hint "ESCAPE" and noticed the obvious thing that it has 2 "E"s with four letters between. There are 2 duplicates of additional number/year/month/day but both are too far apart. If we ignore the additional number and only look for year/month/day repeating values there is one place possible combo: 1950/7/1 is the 33rd and 38th number. This would suggest that 4/1950/7/1 and 1/1950/7/1 both represent E. I'm not confident about this though. 
Another obvious thing is that there are 65 unique combinations. Looking at the fact that again the hint was in all caps, one may assume that the solution is also only in CAPS so that leaves only 26 letters, and some punctuation (whitespace, full stop, comma). So it's entirely possible that two values may translate to the same letter.

Also the fact that the maximum date is 2017 makes an award more sense.

yeah, the issue is obviously that we disregard the month/date. Maybe it's a combination of month/date/additional digit.
