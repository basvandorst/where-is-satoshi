Alright, I agree with you there. During the all-day press release that went down a couple weeks ago involving Microsoft, Santander, ING, BP Oil, etc... a rep from JP Morgan did explicitly say something to the effect of, "we'll just never use Bitcoin."
I guess my hangup is: I don't believe the banks are exuding precious resources to fight a (relatively) tiny $18.6 Billion asset. I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't a threat to them - it's been documented in numerous bank reports as one. I'm just saying that a blanket anti-Bitcoin stance makes no sense. I do believe, however, that the behavior of Bitcoin users and service providers do often extend beyond the tolerance level of most financial institution; KYC being one example of a set tolerance level (one, mind you, which is externally applied on them by regulations). 
In other words, if there's a Venn Diagram of (1) Bitcoin activity, and (2) un-tolerated/risky activity; the banks are, in this case, likely responding to the intersecting activity, not because it's Bitcoin activity, but because it's too risky, either by (a) their standards, or (b) external standards (such as regulations) - I think it's probably more in the "b" category, myself.

They are. I don't think Santander is closing this guy's account over Bitcoin. [They are developing a private blockchain that interfaces with the public blockchain]( ie they are or will be using the same cryptocurrency as us.

*I'm the same guy you were tweeting with, see username.
The information is very up to date. They published a "Vision Paper" one week ago detailing the fact that their private chain will interface with the public chain. The chain I'm referring to is not Bitcoin. It's another chain that if mentioned in this sub will get moderated away so I won't mention it. But if you follow that link you see what blockchain they are using.

Do you know, can you send Ethereum-based assets (ERC-20) from a KeepKey?

Thank you. Yes, that was a typeo. Unfortunately, it's one that changes the conclusion significantly, but I'm glad it was caught.

Nah, this is actually a point Naval Ravikant made at the Blockstack Summit.
When Bezos outpaced Bill Gates as the richest man, it signaled that the internet revolution has now outpaced the computing revolution. The next revolution could arguably be the blockchain revolution. If that's the case, who else would be poised to rise to the highest net worth besides Satoshi?
The question is do people think that's even possible? If so, we have a long way to go. Just a question to put things in perspective.

Friday was my last day working at a Fortune 500. I'm going 100% Blockchain. Couldn't be happier
