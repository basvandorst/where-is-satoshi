I don't often see posts about what it's like to own an ex breeder so here's mine.  Hopefully it will shed some light on the psychological damage that's done to these poor dogs.  I have an ex-breeding bitch.  Her last litter of pups died so she was of no value to the breeder any more.  I adopted her while she was still bleeding and full of milk.  That's how much these breeders care.  I got her spayed so that no matter what happened to me, she would never be bred again.  She has a terrible underbite and the vet said she should never have been bred.  She struggles to eat some things so her treats are broken into smaller pieces for her to manage.
I have never hit her, shouted at her or forced her to do things against her will.  I've used lots of positive reinforcement and every shred of patience I have to try to rehabilitate her.
It took a month to get her to the stage where she would consistently go to the toilet in the garden and not go in the house when I picked up the keys to unlock the door.
It took three months for her to start tolerating human company instead of hiding away in another room by herself.
It took her six months to realise she didn't need to inhale every meal or treat she got, and that nobody was coming to steal it from her.
After about nine months I finally caught her sleeping.  Up until then she would wake at the slightest noise and every time I looked at her she'd be staring back.  Even in the middle of the night.  That was a little creepy.
It took a year to get her to start volunteering to go for walks.  She would still prefer not to go but chooses to go with my other dog rather than stay in the house alone.  She only likes the park though.  She hates her lead and will try to bite it off, so we go to the park where she can run free.
After 5 years she still doesn't like children and won't allow them to approach her.  Once at the park there was a group of mums with babies in prams.  She freaked the fuck out like it was the village of the damned approaching.  I had to catch her, put her lead on and take her in the opposite direction or she'd have run away.  She ran away a lot, at the slightest provocation in the early years.  So we can only go to parks not surrounded by traffic.
She will immediately defecate if she's put into a scary situation e.g. if someone she doesn't know is standing between her and her only exit.  Every time we have people around, or go to the vet, or to a strange environment I have to make sure she's emptied her bowels beforehand.
It takes her a long time to trust new people so instad of taking her to a groomers I've had to learn how to do it myself.  She's had some really shitty haircuts, but at least she allows me to do it.
She's great indoors, in her own house, when no visitors are around.  She likes squeaky toys, she's smart and loves puzzles.  She obsessively cleans herself like a cat and if I run a bath she gets excited and puts her paws up on the edge hoping it's for her.  She would sell her soul for McDonalds chips.  But because she spent the first four years of her life in a shed I don't think she'll ever be completely normal. She's institutionalised for lack of a better word.
I know you have your heart set on this puppy already and it isn't the puppy's fault that these breeders are arseholes but next time, if you have an opportunity to adopt a dog instead of putting money into a breeder's hands, do that instead.

Nowhere in my post did I state my own stance on independence so you're kinda arguing against yourself there.  For the record, I'm pro-independence.
None of the polls I've seen had the yes side in the lead, the gap has closed but no is still winning out.  That's why I said it's unlikely *at the moment.* Moments are subject to change :)
I have done research, I have a copy of the white paper.   There's a lot of FUD on both sides but I don't think it can be denied that the news focuses on all the negative stuff (like always!) and spreads doom and gloom about our financial capability.  I personally believe that we would cope but I don't think the transition would be as easy as the Yes side would like us to believe.
I happen to agree about debit cards and I barely touch money these days but lots of people don't use them.  You can't force people to switch - I have a friend who literally does not have a bank account and nothing will persuade him to get one.
Lastly, I've never voted, this will the the first time.  If we lose, then no, I won't vote for any of those parties in the UK elections. Like you, I'm disillusioned with British politics, it's why I want independence.

I don't know.  I'm trying to think of helpful responses but I keep coming back to the thought that I'm not convinced that there's a bitcoin gender divide.
I do believe that it's mostly men aged 20-40 using bitcoin but I don't see that as being indicative of a problem.  I think men are more likely to be early-adopters and that it's still early days for bitcoin so it's only natural that this group would have the most noticeable presence on the forums at the moment.
I think there are a lot of markets bitcoin hasn't penetrated yet.  Older people, youths who can't buy from exchanges, people without smartphones, people without disposable income...the list goes on.  So, bearing that in mind, I think it would be foolish to just focus on making things more inclusive for women.  If women aren't getting involved it's not because our vaginas forbid it, it's for some other reason.
I personally think that the problem with bitcoin is that everything's still quite clunky.  The current coin buying process is ludicrous.  I can either wait days to buy on an exchange that might do a Gox on me, or I can pay over the odds on localbitcoins.  If someone came along and made the buying/selling process really fast and easy in a shiny, sexy package then that would go a long way to convincing people to give it a try.
As things currently stand, I think you've just gotta be patient.  Try to make the community better for everyone, not just select groups.

Scottish girl here.  Independence isn't looking all that likely at the moment and even if it happens most of us want to keep the pound.  All we ever hear in the news is how we can't afford to be independent, there's enough uncertainty without deciding to throw bitcoin into the mix.
Also, cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to forget that there are still little old grannies without computers and smartphones so it's not even ready for mass adoption.  Honestly, it seems like this Guy Debelle fella is just pulling stuff out of his arse.

When I tried to sign up with the username aye I got an error message saying my payment address had to be between so many characters.  I checked my payment address loads of times and tried different ones.  It made no difference.  
The only thing that worked was to make my username longer.  aye wouldn't work, ayeaye did.  Presumably there's a minimum length for usernames but the error message given was about the payment address, NOT the username.

I don't think that's fair, I have had opinions on the blocksize cap long before I heard Gavin and Mike's views.
If bitcoin can't support user transactions on the blockchain then I don't think it is viable.  I would like the network to be scalable and I do believe there is a place for settlement layers and off-chain solutions but I think it is important that the users have a choice of whether or not to use them.
I have yet to see how centralised the Lightning Network will be but it seems it will be expensive to run hubs.  If it's only large companies like Paypal that can run them then I'm not interested.  One of the things that inspired me to get involved in bitcoin is Visa and Mastercard's refusal to process donations for Julian Assange's legal defence fund.  That's completely unacceptable in my eyes.
I want to retain my ability to send bitcoins directly on the blockchain because if my only option is to send them via a handful of centralised payment processors there will inevitably be abuses and blacklisting.
Seven transactions per second isn't going to cut it in the long run.

I don't understand how Core supporters can condone theymos's actions.  Banning users, saying 90% of the sub should leave and deleting topics regarding XT just ensures redditors who want to learn about it will go to the other subs - most or all of which have a pro-XT bias since they have become havens for people who were banned from here for discussing it.  Those pro-XT subs are where users are more likely to be convinced to support it.
We should be striving for a return to an open, balanced discussion that everyone can participate in even if it's 'extremely repetitive and frankly uninteresting' because what we're witnessing now is the Streisand effect in action.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:40:02
I was [under the impression]( that it would be prohibitively expensive to run a hub.
If it is possible for me and thousands of others to run hubs I would feel more secure about Lightning Network.  If it takes huge companies like Paypal to run them, I would not.
It seems I may have more reading to do on the subject.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:46:28
Thank you for taking the time to reply, it is appreciated!
I don't kid myself that I'm an expert or that I understand even half the things you dev wizards do so I can only speak from my experience as a user.
For as long as I've been involved with bitcoin there have been (endless) discussions about the blocksize and I have only seen it become more contentious as time goes on.  As a user, I would like to see it ultimately resolved, one way or another.  If this is how bad it is now while the network is small, how much worse would it be if there were 10x more users?
XT may, or may not, have the best solution but it does appear to be a more elegant solution than the Lightning Network which seems to forever be accompanied by hand-waving and promises of Soon™.
So, rightly or wrongly, XT has thrown down a gauntlet.  That doesn't mean to say that it will win.  It also doesn't stop Core (or anyone else) from implementing their solution to the problem.  Not everyone who wants a blocksize increase likes XT's solution but it seems to be the only one currently on offer.
I am dismayed to see the community so fractured over this issue but I believe more communication between devs and users is the key to resolution.  I'm fed-up of hearing weak anti-XT arguments like the 'cups of coffee don't belong on the blockchain' and 'XT is an altcoin' and 'governmentcoin' and 'Mike Hearn wanted blacklists'.  There seems to be a lack of real, good, thorough anti-XT arguments being put forth and that's a real shame.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:34:13
I agree.  We have already seen traditional payment processors abuse their powers by refusing to relay funds to individuals (Julian Assange), businesses (backpage.com) and embargoed states (Cuba).  I don't know why Lightning Network hubs would behave any differently.
From a legislation point of view, it is far easier to legislate against, subvert and influence a handful of processors than it is a p2p network.
I believe we, at a minimum, must scale the bitcoin network's blocksize enough that users can choose to make direct transactions at a reasonable cost if they want to.  Lightning Network payment processors will only behave if they don't have a monopoly on the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-08-18 16:25:25
I worry that BIP 101 is too ambitious (too much, too soon) and if Core implemented a more cautious scaling solution I would support that instead.
Since there hasn't been consensus on this issue when it has dragged on for years, and after seeing the shit-storm of abuse, censorship, ad hominem attacks and proposed XT sabotage that have surrounded its release, I feel that as the number of users grows it could only get worse.  I am concerned that without XT blocksizes could end up stuck at 1mb indefinitely.
I support the only option available to me, albeit somewhat reluctantly.

It is a good question but I would personally be extremely disappointed if any were to attempt to hold the community to ransom with their answers.  If XT achieves consensus then I'm sure some developers would be disappointed but I would hope that, for all our sakes, they would accept it and move on with good grace.

I could be wrong but isn't it in the miners interests to mine the more popular chain?
Unless miners are ideologically opposed to XT, I think they would mine whichever chain is being perceived as the real bitcoin.  
Given that most users could host a node if they wanted to, wouldn't a majority of XT nodes tell the miners that it's what the majority of users want?

I'm subbed here but don't post, I prefer the other place.  I believe Craig.  There are many reasons but I'll very briefly post a couple that aren't touched on very often.
CW didn't just fall out of the tree in 2016.  In 1996 he posted on the [cypherpunks mailing list](  That's proof he had enough interest in cryptography 20 years ago that he joined a niche mailing list.
He has a motive for remaining ambiguous.  If you were Satoshi and supposedly owned [1m bitcoin]( would you publicly prove your identity?  Wouldn't you worry about your safety?  If the shit hits the fan, it's too late, there's no putting that genie back in the bottle.
He has corroboration from Gavin.  Gavin said CW [provided proof]( privately and that the personalities of CW and Satoshi matched.  Because CW didn't provide public proof, Gavin has had his character assassinated and his contributions to the project diminished but he **still** hasn't thrown Craig [under the bus](
CW was referred to as [the last Satoshi]( which brings up a point.  With the supposed 'damage' CW is causing to the project, if he isn't Satoshi why hasn't RealSatoshi put a stop to it?  He could easily [do that]( without compromising his own anonymity.
Say CW isn't Satoshi, so what?  Ignore him, move on, don't feed the troll.  But say he is Satoshi, does that change your opinion on the vitriol he receives?  The people he's chosen to align himself with and the ones he hasn't?  About the scaling debate?  About the need for the other subreddit?
Ultimately, it doesn't matter if we disagree about CW, proof probably won't be forthcoming.  But if the community can listen to what [Luke Dashjr]( has to say with a straight face even though he's a hypocrite who spammed the blockchain with [biblical verses]( then can't we give Craig the same [courtesy](

I did my first transaction with localbitcoins.  I wanted to use bitstamp for my second transaction but they took ages verifying so I used kraken.com instead (they verified in a day).
Basically, I found that after paying the bank's transfer fee (£10), the crappy exchange rate and the inflated price of btc after the days I spent waiting...I'd have been better using localbitcoins after all.
That said, it would be more cost effective to use the exchanges if you're buying larger amounts.  I've personally only bought fractions of bitcoin so far.

The draw of an ATM is that it's convenient because it's instantaneous.  You don't need to be the cheapest bitcoin vendor, you just need to be reasonably competitive with online prices.
The kind of people who want the absolute best price are the people who don't mind waiting for days (Like Amazon users).
The curious and impulsive people, passing customers, the newbies and the people who want bitcoins NOW to order something on the Silk Road.  Those people are your target market so appeal to them.

I've explained it to three people so far:
My mum, who was genuinely interested and hinted twice 'that would make a good christmas present for someone.'  So now I'm trying to look into paper wallets.  I'm going to feel cheap giving her a fraction of something though.
My less-than-scrupulous aunt whose interest was only piqued when I mentioned it being an ideal currency for shady dealings on the Silk Road.
My uncle, who basically thinks it's a scam.
I think I must suck at explaining bitcoin.

~~Is there a list of what all the tips mean?  I see the flip was a 1 which was an internet which in turn seems to be 25 cents but what was the alternative flip(s)?~~
Edit: found it via the bot's 'What is this?' link.  I'm a moron. Carry on!

I'm not sure undermining your parents is the best solution here (you should really try to talk them again and come to a compromise) but your best bet is to find someone willing to exchange bitcoins for cash locally via localbitcoins.com.  Do the exchange somewhere public.  Take a friend.  Stay safe.

There's a page about QR sizes [here](  The tl;dr seems to be, the more complex the QR is the bigger the minimum size is, just to be sure the camera can read it accurately.
