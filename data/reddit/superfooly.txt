Lol. Couldn't find any other sources for his past opinions, but that's a funny take. Like watching grass grow. Slow but steady.

Good. Now hold it until $1m usd. And more importantly, store it somewhere safe, back up your keys, etc. Don't be a me.... :\(

Store it on a ledger. Leave it a plane ride away from you \(aka at your mom's or distant family, etc\). Back up codes in \*another\* separate location. You'll have a pubkey and you can always deposit/check balance via that. No one else can access it without the private keys, and you can even hash them or multisig so you'd need 2/3 people or something similar.
