Everyone trading in Canada that will eventually cash out in CAD uses Quadra to my knowledge. There were other choices before but not anymore.
From my experience they are pretty good, fees are fair but it depends on the mining or gas price at the time. Which is based on volume for the currency. Understand that this is early adoption and there are still many scaling issues that will come up. I paid 18 USD to get my BTC out of Coinbase last week and the fees were the same for a small amount $$ or an amount twice it’s size $$. Reddit was bitching about the fees last week as a whole.
Also fun fact take yesterday for example BTC was trading on Coinbase last night for 18,389.00 and on Quadra it was 16,400.00. So there’s obviously benefits to being on multiple exchanges sometimes.

Don’t you tell me what to do! Instinctually goes and buys more BTC out of spite.

Agreed if my big Canadian bank decides to take the same actions I will pull all my CC, LOC, Mortgage, etc. Please tell me where I can spend my money and see what happens.
Banks adapt or die....I hope RBC is the next Blockbuster and Jon Oliver sends you a crusty jockstrap to save your last branch in Moosejaw out of pity and nostalgia.

Fellow maple use Quadracx.

I’m new but I️ heard Kraken currently has got some issues. Buddy even posted a “Kraken we need talk” manifesto today with a lot of agreeing chit chatter. I️ use Quadracx I️ know they fucked up in the past however everything has been super smooth for me. It works with my bank for etransfers buy/sell/trade all that Jazz. However its limited if your looking for numerous alts.

Is that what’s doing down... fak?

It’s all about perceived value and perceptions are changing. Bitcoin maybe not, but crypto in general will eventually pass golds marketcap, I would bet my life on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:11:39
Cool I will buy more...!

Super sad, sick thing is mine is on the DHL truck as this fuckery goes does.  Paid the duty this am. Is there really a need for me to move it now? 
This is my first hack that I wasn’t prepared for. Thoughts?

I have personally done a number of fundings and everything was smooth. Until last night when my bank screwed up. However Quadra got back to me with 6 hours which is amazing from what I’m hearing and everything was fixed. Good luck!

Mine took a while because I didn’t write the message on the pic and I had to redo it. I was a little to eager to buy. 
Did you do the equifax portion? Maybe they are just really backed up. I did mine a while ago so maybe they weren’t that busy, back then. Coinbase is expensive AF on every level can’t withdraw from CAD. Kraken has pissed off most of the Reddit community. I will admit I haven’t tried to withdraw a penny yet. I’m hodler. However I did read the reviews from other canucks and they got their money out no problem. If you want more flavours of the alt market they don’t have much but for the big guys they have everything. 
Just be careful of the trading bots people have running. It’s always the same amounts buying and selling driving the prices. I could be totally wrong but this has been my experience.

Smart contracts I’m sure are at play, thus more on the Ethereum side yes

Have you received funds out of ndax.io? What was the process like? I have never heard of it before and I am always interested in having new tools in the tool box. Shakepay appears to only support BTC atm. I’m glad to see there’s more options in Canada.
