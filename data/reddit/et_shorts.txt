It makes me think of the post on the front page y/day about how the Black Cab Strike in London protesting Uber resulted in an 850% increase in adoption of Uber.
You get the feeling some of these steps that humanity is making are locked in, ain’t nothing will change them - especially the pre-scripted tweets of an NPD barrel of expired mayonnaise

I mean, if anyone knows fiat‘s a joke you‘d think it would be governments, amirite?
I guess the hook to make it true would have to be the assertion that bitcoin really was the gift to the world, and any other alt just doesn’t tick the boxes like btc does.  
If that assertion is true, then of course they‘ll use the media to manipulate and then accumulate. 
Coupla if‘s in there but over the years history is really not on any Goverment‘s side when it comes to credibility

Tabloids are great tools for propagandists - light on science, heavy on fear.
It’s way cool how the piece trashes bitcoin and goes on to sing the praises of such trustworthy institutions as Facebook, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.  Trust the big boys who are always fighting for you, the underdog, with their fair business practices and loyalty to ethics...woe betide the evil tech abomination! praise the lord god thy dollar!
Got a bit carried away there. 
Point is I don’t think we need mass adoption from the Extra Fries demographic to be honest.  Let em continue to eat that shit for breakfast

Maybe it’s time for the community to distance itself from the HODL meme it has outgrown. 
It Bitcoin wants to grow up its users &amp; supporters must do the same. 
„bet on the future: hold bitcoin“  
What’s so difficult about typing that? It sounds way fucking cooler.
Edit: punctuation

Crypto Pro (free but some features are paid) allows you to create alerts for prices at desired levels across different currencies and exchanges.
I’m pretty happy with it!

Yo this is a great piece.  
I remember spending days on ZH during &amp; after 2008.  no surprises in that DB / Lehman chart, because essentially nothing changed &amp; nothing was learned from back then.  If anything they got greedier...
