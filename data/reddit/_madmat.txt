You need the private key to sign the transaction. Miners only accept signed transactions.

"Am I the first man you have ever loved?" he said.
"Of course," she answered "Why do men always ask the same question?".

People are stupid, just learn to deal with it.

I like this idea, but I am french, and in french "bit" is pronounced as "bite" which means "cock". 
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:22:48
Merci beaucoup

This is too Much!

80% of my cash is in bitcoin. I always hated banks and i see bitcoin as a way to escape from them. A lot of infrastructure and merchants needed, by the way.
@_date: 2014-11-23 13:19:16
Thanks, I love donuts.

Is there a way to download it?

I will collect every tipping dust the other ones consider as spam.
Please don't tip me more than 50cents.
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:36:02
To get a new use each time someone new is tipped ?
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:50:51
Please tell us where it is.
@_date: 2014-11-24 09:28:51
I use intellij and its markdown plugin.
Intellij is not accepting bitcoin :(

Changetip integration is made by changetip. Coinbase integration is done by the website. This is the force of changetip, they have no chance to be integrated by twitter or facebook, so they did it themselves.

Just buy some, spend some and spread the world.

Bitcoin is the future, but we still have to make it happen. Tips are a good way for that.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:30:34
This game is going to make more than 1% of bitcoin transaction!!!

Free speech is not an option. Get paid in bitcoin for your writings and close your bank account in this bank.

Sell all your coins! Bitcoin is about to die.

Hi Cameron, could you be more precise about "quite soon" or is this your way to say "2 weeks©®" ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:36:43
i don't know for the time, could be days. The guy is not going to lose it. Technically, he still has it.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:57:46
Because you paid only 14,97 satoshis per byte (10000/668) and you have to pay at least 21/30 satoshis per byte to get included in the next 4 blocks : 
Consider using another wallet, e.g. copay.

Size of the transaction depends on the number of inputs, not the amount. We are entering fee market, so a lot of people will get same issue using wallets with fixed fees. You just have to wait for the transaction to disappear and ask for a new one, with higher fees.

You are under 5, you will not understand.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:39:53
blockchain.info is just a bad wallet, tell him to forget it.
@_date: 2016-02-21 09:02:13
i would say, buy 0.55!
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:31:49
Bonne chance

Coinbase is not a hot wallet, it is a bank. Bitcoins there are not yours.
