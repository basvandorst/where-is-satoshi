Thanks, but I jsut recieved the BTC!
I don't like the way Coinsource handled that though. I expected things to churn slow (even slower than that actually), but sending me a 'confirmation' before it was true, that threw me off and ticked me off a bit. Unless I'm just not understanding something all that well?

That's what I would be inclined to think, but the service said they wouldn't send a receipt/confirmation text until the BTC was confirmed in my wallet.
I really hope I don't have to contact support.
Have people had problems like this before with Coinsource?

Awesome and concise explanation, thanks. 
I think what happened prior was them being unclear. They send a text that says "you will receive a text once it has been confirmed in your wallet".... then they send you a text receipt.
Then, an hour later, the send you "confirmed in your wallet"

This is a pretty cool design. The one thing I don't like i shaving a person on it (yes I know who that is, but I mean in general). With decentralization and the other pushes of bitcoin, I would like to see us stop putting people on currency. I'd like to see us more representing important concepts and hopes of our community/society.
To be fair I'm not sure what I'd replace it with, something very scientific and regal looking, to get the point across of furthering ourselves as a whole in an intelligent mannor. Maybe some picture that gets across helping the common man and not the robber baron?
Lastly I do have a soft spot in my heart for the 8bit looking coins.
But this is definitely a really good design, very well thought out.
