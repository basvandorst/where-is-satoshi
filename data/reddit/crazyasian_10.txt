Look at the tech behind Bitcoin verse other cryptos as well as incoming updates. Currently the only thing Bitcoin has going for it is being first and most mainstream.
Look at the fundamentals behind it and decide

Probably the biggest payment processor. Majority of any websites taking payments probably use them
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:51:13
Can you give me an example? Curious.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:55:49
Nothing else to do but spam memes until Bitcoin scaling solutions are released apparently

Jesus dude you asked how to use the lightning network and I told you my recommendation. It's alpha/beta software that shouldn't be used on the Main Net yet. Unless you want to volunteer your money to potentially be lost at the benefit of possibly finding existing bugs
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:07:41
Yep, you're absolutely not allowed to mention altcoins here either. I wouldn't be able to type out a specific alt here for example without getting it removed/banned.
But apparently it's okay if it's BCH and everyone is just bashing on it of course.
Lightning is still in Alpha/Beta anyway and shouldn't be used on Main net at risk of losing coins.

What are you even on about
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:27:56
Feel free to point out where I just said anything about LN centralization and sucking?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:21
You can't say the cursed words or the M~~ods~~inistry comes after you
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:14:35
I would say they're completely different trying to solve different things
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:05:42
Are you paying like $40 in fees
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:51
Who the fuck uses Bitcoin to buy other crypto's tbh
Buying ETH/LTC is lower fees and faster
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:53:19
How about you tell people to just do their own research and determine the own potential issues and problems within Bitcoin/Crypto for themselves rather than cover their ears and scream that everything is okay
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:50:12
It was pretty stupid though lol
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:29:26
Give it a few more days. Bitcoin xd
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:58:45
Very basically, theres lots and lots of transactions that need to be processed. Ones with lower fees get processed slower. To get processed in a semi-reasonable time you need to increase the fee
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:46:45
Yeah Bitcoins really showing them with it's amazing transaction fees and times xd
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:54:20
Use an alternative until Bitcoin fixes its shit up, it's really just not viable for small transactions now
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:39:02
Because Bitcoin is in a shit situation at the moment with slow transactions and high fees. So what else is there to do but bash other coins?
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:45:08
His comment means nothing because his reddit account is only 18 days old? You bein serious mate
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:55:34
Yeah, let's go buy a drink and pay $15 fees xd
Real viable global currency there
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:40:05
Someone complaining about Bitcoins high fees? MUST B3 SHILLS!!1!1!!
Also where did he try to imply Coinbase fees = Bitcoin fees anyway? The actual fee he paid to Coinbase was lower than the actual transaction fee anyway
God damn the paranoia here
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:03:10
Do your research on both sides and decide for yourself.
Don't get sucked into hype or circlejerk and make the wrong choice because other people just say it's better because they're more invested in one thing emotionally.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:47:50
Oh yeah it's ridiculously stupid and petty.
Bitcoin isn't really going to have anything done to it for a few months anyway with LN and however X2 goes down. So it's basically just Entertaining Drama until then
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:37:16
Ask someone off the street what Cryptocurrency is and 99.5% of the time they're going to say either no clue or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:30:47
It's almost as if you could be subscribed to multiple subreddits?!?!
This post belongs elsewhere
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:43:38
Im sure you'll be okay to read through a post, the big bad bullies aren't going to hurt you
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:53:21
How is that a good thing? You want something that's build upon peoples ignorance on just wanting to just make a quick buck? 
I'm sure that'll end well
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:29:40
How do you deal with Bitcoin fees being like 10-50% of your month wage then? Doesn't that end up being a bit of a problem?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:51:26
IMO It's never going to go Mainstream.
No average consumer is going to want to use Bitcoin how it is
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:21:05
But if I'm subbed to and do I really need ETH news on both of them? Also the fact that only allows Alt talk if it's negative news.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:16:52
Or it's just going to send faster and cheaper than bitcoin. Why spend $5 in fees when you could do it for cents?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:49:57
DAE Shill because they disagree with me xd
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:26:15
Just because it's going up in price, doesn't mean it's just going to continuously go up in value
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:41:05
Are you saying his business isn't hurt by high fees and long confirmation times though?
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:25:15
I would try do your own research and look away from or for info. You're probably not going to find much unbiased info from either
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:22:01
Just checked in my ass and I think it could crash down to 1-2k, or could sit at around 12k.

Fairly neutral and decent stance depending on how they handle the whole

Do you have 2FA on?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:21:49
Is this true though? People actually use phones and the internet - whereas Bitcoin just attracts stupid money on people just looking to get rich because Bitcoin. I doubt the majority of people with Bitcoin actually use it for any transactions at all.
Same goes for any Crypto really
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:19:07
Maybe maybe not depending on how 2x goes.

BTCmarkets verified really quickly for me.

Never had them send a physical letter. Me and a mate joined this year and it was just ID Verification I believe

The top rated comment + Vitalik aren't defending him on the thread. As well as other upvoted comments. Subreddits aren't Hiveminds you know, people do have different opionions as unbelievable as that is
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:01:15
Yeah I don't really understand how this is a viable usage of Bitcoin. Not too sure on the pricing of things in Venezuela but I would assume a 20c transaction fee is quite a bit?
