Just because people are talking about a "correction" doesn't mean that it will happen. This is a decision you will have to make based on your time horizon and other views of bitcoin.

I am not to clear on how hardware wallets operate. Any suggestions to learn
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:46:58
So then would you suggest mobile or desktop. I use a mac. 
My question with that though is what if my phone/laptop gets destroyed. As well as the hardware wallet. Is it then gone?
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:27:14
Bummer, alright thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:00:06
So the main reason you say not to use an online wallet is due to the easier ability of someone being able to hack me. 
So if i restore my funds to a desktop wallet on my mac I still use the same seed right? or Is a new seed created once I move wallets.

I have this already an order of 12 words in a specific order, I keep it in a safe. 
So if I keep this on my computer and something happens to my computer I can take this seed and enter it into another wallet be it mobile or online.
So to move my online wallet now I could use this seed to move it to a desktop computer?

I think this helps, it comes out to say that my weighted acb is 5290 CAD which doesn't seem right
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:07:33
They verified me as of 2ish days ago
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:56:38
ya I got it now, its $5900 CAD still not bad with current prices
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:50:01
Nice try IRS.

Chasing them does nothing, just had to wait. There are so many people after them
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:53:36
Stay tuned, I don't think I'm that stupid but we shall find out
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:59:43
UPDATE: I'm to tipsy for this, avg price is 5200 CAD. Back to gaming. Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:58:47
is there one that you use over the others?
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:02:26
This is a cloud wallet. You would be better having a wallet on your computer or even better a hardware wallet. It is just safer in general.

She should have done her own research and Due diligence. She shouldn't solely rely on you, don't feel bad. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:28:10
Tell her there is no such thing as "quick" money, there is only luck for that 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:53:23
