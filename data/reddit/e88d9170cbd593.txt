Oh that was me. I made a limit buy order for $17k, driving the price to $19k. The price fell to $16k as soon as I cancelled. Currently I'm providing support at the $16k level and it seems to be holding.

I think it's CYA for 2x.

Why is this approved and an ETF is not?

Shit. No longer an early adopter. SELL!~

A Trezor. Except that I used coinbase's wallet because I bought some new coins specifically for the purpose. And coinbase's wallet subtracts fees from the amount sent, so I underpaid and had to get refunded.

But there's still a chance. This is a weakness when using stocks for wealth preservation. Bitcoin has no backing company and is free of this particular risk.

It's linear. It's arithmetic. It's geometric. It's exponential. It's parabolic. It's hyperbolic. It's amazing!!!

Miners take some of your bitcoins for including your transaction in a block. With every transaction you deliberately pay more than you intend for the recipient and the miners keep the extra you include. Right now it costs about 350 satoshi's (0.00000350 BTC) per byte to entice a miner to quickly include your transaction. A typical transaction might cost 0.0009 BTC with one input and two outputs. If you're sending to multiple addresses then you get kind of a volume discount as you amortize transaction and change address overhead. Miners do not know nor care whether you're using Electrum.

You'd beat yourself up no matter how much you bought in 2010. But one thing you're not beating yourself up about is losing BTC to mtgox.com, mybitcoins.com, or butterfly labs.

There's only one plan that makes sense. Tax bitcoin gains at 15% and use the money to build nuclear reactors for mining bitcoin.

And currently even... 
It's like the nebula of an exploded star.
Don't leave your coins on coinbase or on any other exchange.

I've never used that wallet. The most important job of a wallet is to protect your private keys. I don't know much about blockchain.info but it's worth some research to make sure your keys are yours, even if blockchain.info disappears overnight. I lost 35 BTC to mybitcoin.com when they failed so just make sure this can't happen with blockchain.info.
If blockchain.info is taking too long to process a transaction then the fee is too low. I'm using mycelium on android and a fee of 330 sat/byte processes within the hour. I sent some coins from a bitcoin-qt node last night with a fee of 0.0033 BTC/kb (330 sat/byte) and they all processed in 15 to 30 minutes. Can you set the fee in the blockchain.info wallet? Check current fees here

All of it? What if I buy a coffee in 2021 for 0.0001 BTC and the guy notices the sending address has 90 BTC and the change address has 89.9999 BTC less a fee. Not a big deal, unless he's mafia.
