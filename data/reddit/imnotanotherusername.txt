Do anyone know if this is legit? I couldn't find a website or anything online about the store they said they had in Chicago and the Whois information for l-os.com uses an address and phone number for a library in San Diego.
Has anyone purchased anything through their online store and received it?

If I may also add, fuck it. Fuck that shit. That is all.

Hate it or love it, just as long as you're not indifferent. That's art.

The original is really big, this is just a photo of it. I should have uploaded it at a higher resolution. The address is shown in the painting - 1HEe1KCFY3bQzVLFwtMqJg8Vb14z1MkcJx - and the QR is the same. Keep in mind this is an experimental art piece, not exactly an end user tested product :)

That's awesome. I'll be sure to pass that on to her. I'm sure she'll appreciate hearing that.

touché - it's all relative to the observer when it comes to art.

She's still somewhat new to bitcoin but is really fascinated by it. I helped her generate the address and she knows to keep the private key secure. 
It's really amazing to think that people she doesn't know from anywhere in the world can send value to her through her painting. There's just something magical about that within itself.

I'm not sure where the peanut butter cups inspiration came from. Maybe that's the secret power source for producing the magic. Peanut butter cups make me happy. mmmmm... candy is good. 
Thanks for the nice compliment, I'll be sure to pass it on. I know she'd appreciate hearing it.
Edit: She's fascinated by bitcoin but is still new to how it all works. This is her first journey down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Here's the address for anyone looking for a little magic in their life. -- 1HEe1KCFY3bQzVLFwtMqJg8Vb14z1MkcJx

I shared two completely different pieces of her art days apart. I don't see how that is sharing the same thing. 
I've been deeply interested in bitcoin for the last few years. I shared these because I am proud of my sister, excited that she has recently become interested enough in bitcoin to integrate it into her latest pieces and wanted to share it with the community because I thought they would appreciate it as well. 
I guess my assumption that others interested in bitcoin as much as I am would appreciate seeing what she's created. Apparently that assumption doesn't hold true for you. Sorry that you see it as spam or a ploy to get free advertiser for her. It's not.
EDIT: out of the 62.4983 katrillion bad artists, how many of them are selling their pieces to art collectors for tens of thousands of dollars each?

This piece is one of seven she has hanging at the  SpringBreak art show in NYC. The NY Times just wrote an article about the show! It would be awesome if her art helps introduce bitcoin to people in some way.

I believe they call that a Freudian slip.

It's a magic piggy bank. Kind of like tossing some change in a water fountain. The QR code is the bitcoin address for the work. Add a little bitcoin and receive magic. 
It's an experimental way of making a painting interactive with the viewer. Tossing change into the fountain at the mall is one thing, but adding this same type of interactivity in a digital and anonymous form that isn't bound by geography and doing it within a painting is unique to the awesomeness of cryptocurrency.
Here's her website [

What do you mean 2 mentions? Which rule did I break?

What if they ran a sweepstakes that awarded the winners a shitload of bitcoins?

He mentioned that Cyprus University accepted it for tuition. She wasn't impressed.

Sometimes even really intelligent people have a hard time looking past the seed of now in order to accept the forest that it could become.

Ignore wife, pursue bitcoin.

Source: Myself, sitting on couch drinking beer while coming across a bitcoin debate on Street Signs, CNBC. Did she just make a crazy face mocking his bitcoin stance I said to myself. Rewind. Play. Rewind. Laugh. Pull out phone. Rewind. Try to pause at good photo opp. More difficult than expected. Wish my cable box supported slow mo. It doesn't. I must share with reddit. Cannot let my fellow man down. I persist. A few rewind/pause attempts later I captured the image as posted. Job complete. 
Edit: Wow! I got Reddit Gold and a bitcoin tip! First time receiver of both! Thanks for making my day! Makes me want to tip it forward!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:41:42
My first bitcoin tip! Awesome. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:04:59
That was easy.

My wife wanted me to put up Christmas lights. I decided to drink beer and watch TV instead. Conclusion.... Listening to your wife will make you miss out on Karma.
