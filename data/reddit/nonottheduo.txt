My guess is OP's line of thinking is the way he distributes his stand up now.  He self-produces and distributes his stand up videos on his web site for a $5 donation: 
Could cut processing fees even more if he accepted BTC.

I've personally seen and setup 2 of them, so yes, they do exist in the wild.  The Nexus on the front is worthless - the Easyminer software is horrendous to try to navigate.

You don't have to buy them in person.  There's an option to buy them by depositing into the seller's bank account and then the seller releases them to you after the deposit is verified.

NCUA = FDIC for credit unions.  Same protections, same insurance amount.  You have nothing to be worried about.

You shouldn't be allowed to go negative on sending attackers.
