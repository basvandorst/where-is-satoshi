Sorry to pick out one line, but what do you feel **is** the best representative? I know you mentioned several alternative altcoins, but it sounds like you have one in mind, again by this sentence alone.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but no harm in diversifying a wee bit.

This whole thing is fucking bizarre. Sending BTC into a "death spiral" would be catastrophic...
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:50:26
Jesus, enough forks already. This is getting ridiculous.

It's amazing that nothing has, really, changed about the tech wrt Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash but we're still seeing these huge swings. I'm still a noob when it comes to any type of trading but this really seems crazy.

So what's going on with this then?

Very cool. Get a discount for using Bitcoin; they should be grateful.  :D

Well, if anyone knows about [fraud]( it's [JP Morgan](

At least now I have absolutely no option except to hodl.

Well, that woman's next tweet was saying something similar.

Why does the price always, seem to, drop at the weekends? I end up spending way too much time over the weekend looking at the price index.

Welcome to the suck.  :D
Not serious, but it can be stressful.  :)

You think having his life savings stolen is his comeuppance for making a few snarky comments on the internet?? Karma my foot.

There seems to be China drama every 2 days now.  :/
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:26:59
Damnit China, can you just chill...
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:21:35
Any ideas about what's driving this surge? The gold fork or the google news maybe?
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:02:41
So it's just a new ATH every day now, is that what's happening?
