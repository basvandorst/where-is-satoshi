All of this just reminds me of the big mt.gox scandal. There might be different circumstances now, but still a reminder of what can happen.

Well in reality, you COULD lose money. It depends on the value of bitcoin. If the price of 1 bitcoin goes up (from the original price you bought in) you make money, if it goes down you lose. It sounds like you are very new to bitcoin investing. I suggest you educate yourself a little more about bitcoins before you invest. But if you buy right now you lock yourself in at a lower price (assuming the price is going to rise).

The world needs people like you. I truly admire you, you’re the type of person who deserves all the money you have. This gives me lots of hope.

I’m using Gdax too. I have Coinbase on my phone just to watch the graphs.

When I was 13 I went to Alaska and swam in the pool after these people had done a thing called a polar plunge. The pool was on the verge of frozen. I had a similar feeling. Oh the youth days haha

Just a few years ago Mt Gox went down along with my bitcoins. I’d be a millionaire. Everything happening in Kraken reminds me of MtGox and tells me to say away from Kraken at all costs.

For me it was a perfect time to jump in on the bitcoin train :). I’ve been watching bitcoins for years so I’m not worried one bit (no pun intended).

I first verified on the Coinbase phone app, you can just use your cell phone to take a pic of your id. It is much easier. Once you are verified on Coinbase goto GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase log in and password. GDAX is much more effective when you use it on your computer, Coinbase is convenient for mobile devices. Hope this helps.

Right now I’m just keeping an eye on them. It’s too early for me to get in the game, but it can be argued that it is never too early. Anything that could effect the price of a bitcoin should be kept under close watch.

 I lived thru the mtgox crash and I’m still around.
