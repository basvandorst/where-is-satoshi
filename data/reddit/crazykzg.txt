I got bit by the Gox thing...7 BTC. Filed a claim but not too optimistic.  Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong, so who knows what really happened there. But I think Coinbase is more legit and regulated than either of those. Not saying bad things can't happen, but I just don't think so.

So did you get your funds?

Coinbase is reputable so I wouldn't be too worried. There was a run on BTC when it was tanking so they were probably unequipped to deal with the sudden demand. Just make sure you have all your documentation and keep the pressure on.

Yep. My mistake on that. I've been using the default fee but going forward will up the ante.

I have a .2 btc transaction pending for two weeks now. Using Electrum with a fee. This sucks.

Bad Opsec by the owner. Should have used private wallet for btc, not coinbase.

That ship has pretty much sailed for individual miners. 75 percent of BTC have already been mined. The processing power you need for mining is enormous. Not worth the expense of starting up.

Actually, I think torrent sites are worse. Lots of pressure by the studios to shut them down. I'd rather take my chances running Silk Road 3.

At this point, it's not an investment I can recommend.

Amazes me how some people can be so smart and so dumb at the same time.

Electrum is good if you want a wallet on your computer.

I use Electrum for some of my BTC. It's a desktop app.
