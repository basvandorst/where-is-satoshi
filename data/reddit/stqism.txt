Will it get stuck? No, it'll just take forever until someone is nice. Bitcoins core itself doesn't add fees iirc, but your client might.

And fixes its million or so security holes.

While we believe it's too soon to package Tox for repos like that, we did setup a repo with our CI system so you can use it. Pretty stable regardless.

Will this check be "Self Governed"?
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:15:27
... Legislation backed by banks, on the grounds that bit coins are used for drugs/destroying us/funding piracy.
Also, they won't...doesn't mean the average citizen knows that though.

And...we hit 16,000.

The authors names now end with a period, this costs $250 over the previous edition.

Im going to have to bing that for you...

While websites help and all, visit  on the freenode irc network. You should be able to pick up a moneypack from your local cvs and trade it for btc in a few hours max.

Okay, as stated earlier, do not at all mention anything bitcoin related.
We saw this with Linux, Ubuntu gained most of its success from a lack of mention of the work linux. The phrase scared people who didn't know what it was, allowing Ubuntu to gain a bit of success.
As all linux distros, they are in the minority. (like bitcoin exchanges)
Ubuntu on the other hand gained a lot more popularity. (like mt.gox)
So lesson learned, no coins, blocks, transactions, bits, bytes, and I'm iffy on banks.

Look at the 2nd column to the right, the price keeps jumping back and forth a tiny amount to the same numbers.

If I hadn't sold most of my btc a while ago, this would of costed me a cool $200 USD...
Man, this currency is fun.

Small withdraws, varied amounts over variable amounts of time exchanged in person in a public area without cameras...everything else is traceable if you tried hard enough...

Hey, google could of had a marquee around a flashing logo, and a geohost advertisement on top.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:44:32
So what if they can't stop you, it'll act as a deterrent to the average citizen.

Folks, this isn't cornfedhobo. See the name? The actual one who had an actual gun pointed at him confirms this on irc, this story isn't even correct.
He did NOT lose money.

The majority of the solutions listed here are a bit too much for family who I assume doesn't know much about bitcoins...how about a wallet only stored in a flash drive, and include instructions in a text file? Leave this in a safe, back it up to a CD to be safe...

Hence why you have to declare when you take $10k+ in or out of the country...

Since when has gold been banned?

Tip: it would be 1 ehz. It goes hz, khz, GHz, thz, phz, then ehz. Kilo, giga, tera, peta, etc...

To be fair, stories of bums on the street making more than people working real jobs are far from rare.
I've heard of bums making over $60 an hour easy, while the jalapeño will pull off a couple cents a day...is that even enough to pay for the electricity?

Step 5 would much more common than step 3, step 5 being legal action. Forbidding citizens from owning bitcoins, trading, even using as a currency.
@_date: 2013-02-22 00:30:39
My idea is a checking like physical trading system for bitcoins, I've got the standard down, a domain, and some test checks...Just need some more money to make it a reality.
