ATH followed by a $400 dip. Welcome to the Rollercoaster. 
I put a bank transfer in when it was around the 9800$ mark, took 2 days for funds to arrive in to Coinbase and when I woke it was the morning it broke $10000. Got on at 10,350$. Within 48 hours it got over 11000$ and then plummeted to 9200$. 
Buckle up &amp; hodl.

Fair play! Was a ball ache setting up the SEPA payment, IBAN, sort codes. Took Revolut 24 hours to clear the payment &amp; another 24 hours for Coinbase to process it &amp; it show in my account.

You’re welcome :) I’m new to BTC but like to think I’m learning quickly. Bought my first lot 10 days ago (Coinbase Rate £6,900) and I just bought more at (£10,290). Crazy how quickly it’s increased in 10 days. 
I would imagine the timescale to transfer from GDAX to a Wallet will vary. As you set the fee you want to pay, I guess that plays a big part as the higher the fee you are willing to pay the quicker it goes. volume of transactions may also play a part I guess.
I’ve got a Ledger Nano S on the way, so I’m looking forward to setting that up &amp; getting my investment out of Breadwallet.

I received mine today and I’ve sent a ‘test’ transfer from my breadwallet to the Nano S. I used the 1-24 hour service which cost me like 66p GBP in fees. 
That was 3 hours ago and it’s still not confirmed but it does show on the Ledger Wallet app. Just got to be patient I guess.
Will use the 10-60 minute transfer option next time, Fees were like 12GBP for it when I looked tho.

GDAX to Trezor won’t be instant. Ppl saying it has taken a good 6-8 hours. I believe it’s down to the fees you select/want to pay. 
I transferred mine from GDAX to BreadWallet &amp; it took around 20-30 minutes to show up.

And now we see the dip! 16k...

That $600 drop...

Wish mine were that quick! Would of meant I could of got in around the 9,000$ mark lol! Guess there’s plenty of factors that can play there part.

The reason yours took that timescale is because they are both card payments as they would of fallen within your daily limit. At the time mine was £325. As my amount was over this it had to be a bank transfer (same as OPs request, it’ll have to be Bank Transfer) &amp; will take 2-3 days :(

Bank to Revolut (Takes a Couple Hours)
Revolut to Coinbase (Takes 2-3 working days)
Coinbase to GDAX (Instant)
Buy BTC on GDAX.
The 2-3 working days is a killer! When you see your deposit submitted and all BTC is doing is going up, up &amp; up...
Funds cleared when it reached 10,300$. Managed to buy at 10,350$, then BTC dropped to a 9,000$. 
Just got to HODL.
This was the cheapest way (avoiding fees) too.

Unreal! Managed to get in at 10,350$ around 7am this morning...

Finally had my GDAX bank transfer go in after waiting 2 days this morning! Woke up and saw it peaked at $10,700 overnight. Managed to get on at $10,350. At work here watching it hit $10,850. Exciting times!

Just invested my first ‘small’ amount in to bitcoin. Just seen this and amended my Apple Watch face...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:17
GDAX is the only one working for me. Coinbase on iOS is spazzing out, can’t even log on to it.

Hopefully this will cheer up the community. Everyone loves gold ����

UI is a huge thing for me when it comes to an app like this and I must say it ticks all the boxes!
Very excited for the release of this as having to use several chrome extension apps was starting to get tedious!

Awesome!
