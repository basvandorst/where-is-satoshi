No shilling, just a PSA. Best possible buy would be blue line, possibly within 2-3% below it, but that isn't likely given the supports. 
In short, I have high confidence of the price going above the yellow line, medium confidence of it hitting orange and low confidence of hit hitting red, but all are possible.

I've been to Uganda last summer. I sponsor a small family that are refugees from South Sudan. They live in Kiryandongo refugee camp. We've been able to do great things with really a small amount of money. 1 USD is roughly 3600 Ugandan shilling. 
We got his family passports for 5 and evacuated them (he is Dinka) from the genocide in South Sudan and got them into a small 3 room house, with few windows and an outdoor toilet and an acre to farm for a little over 1500 bucks USD.
I like to help him out, but sending even 300 USD incurs a 17-27 dollar charge from western union, although it is ready to pick up quickly.
I look forward to the day when I can just send him some ether or LTC.
He's been able to start a small orphanage for fatherless refugees, and has 18 living in that small farm. They battle hunger, malaria, and some political strife all the time, but they are hardy and hopeful. 
The way things get popular there, this could take off, but again, their GDP per capita is so low, don't expect this to raise the premium for us selling. It is a good thing, though.

It's the best parts. Easier to understand the extrapolated vectoring.
