Literally there was a news article not long ago about how the IRS tried to establish a task force to look at actual billionaires’ taxes more closely and it got shut down. Now you’re much more likely to be audited if you’re poor or middle class than if you’re rich. Insane.

Well we won the Cold War because we outspent the Soviet Union and made them think we were going to destroy them lol, forcing them to spend more than they could on defense and weaponry and bases abroad until they collapsed.

Yeah but when has America been interested in true capitalism or the free market?

Yup. You definitely sound like an Alex Jones viewer. 
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:22:01
Watched it all. Thanks man. Keep it up.
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:32:32
telling people the newtown parents are "crisis actors" and they're part of a scheme to take your guns away therefore you better do something about it = just stating facts. 
got it bro ;)
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:04:21
being wrong is protected speech. conspiracy theories are protected speech. BUT harassment isn't protected speech. he harasses entire groups constantly, and more to that, his insane followers believe it and often take it to the next level through violence. So not really shortsighted at all nor a slippery slope. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:24:01
Now you sound like Alex Jones lol. Yeah Trump’s admin would totally place pressure on PayPal. Thiel was part of PayPal and is a huge trump fan. If anything he would get involved to make the government not do it. Lollllll

you do know alex jones reported for RT many times, right?
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:05:51
Yeah that’s why I say harassment isn’t protected speech especially when it’s untrue.

Lol the public figures aren’t even analogous man. Controversy is protected. Harassment is not.  
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:08:47
yeah totally unrelated when he connects gun regulation with the "crisis actors" of the newtown families. totally random and unrelated for then his audience, with their irrational fear of government regulation, to then try to kill the families. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:06:32
harassment isn't protected speech. conspiracy theories and being stupid are protected speech. when you use the latter for the former, it's not censorship for a private company to do it. play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:07:05
 stupid games, win stupid prizes. free speech has repercussions from non-governmental actors. good riddance.

Is the way you argue by moving on from a point after you’ve been rebutted and refuted? So yes you agree Bernie’s situation is quite common for 70 year olds   Thanks for that.

It’s not normal it only happened in the last 6 years that inheritance outpaced wealth generation from earnings and profit. What’s really weird is your lack of facts in favor of mantras and slogans like “stop being poor” and “everyone has a chance.”  Hope you post an original thought someday. ��

@_date: 2019-06-14 22:41:33
I just don’t think borders are useful anymore. If the US can destabilize and exploit entire regions of the world beyond our borders, but then claim “but my borders!” when those displaced by our actions come here for safety and opportunity, I just find it very disingenuous and even hypocritical.  Like we can trace the instability of Central America to the 80s and we are dealing with that influx of refugees now, we can trace the instability in the Middle East from the 90s and Europe is now dealing with that now. And we’ve been at least 70-80 percent a cause of those instabilities.

Yes, a vote for Bernie is a vote for a totalitarian regime. Totally makes sense. Mind you the current presidency has far more totalitarian tendencies than Bernie does. It was Bernie that spearheaded the congressional block (both house and Senate) to prevent the US from funding arm sales to the Saudis who kept bombing Yemen, but unfortunately it was Trump who decided to keep doing it.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:30:43
Borders are particularly stupid. The richest of the rich have 90 percent of everything but magically they convince people that look like them that by drawing a magic line, the brown people crossing it for a better life are the real enemies.
@_date: 2019-06-08 06:08:18
Absolutely. Even in 5 years it’ll be life changing especially if you have student debt or wish to buy a house.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:59:53
From your second sentence the fact you equate wealth with effectiveness and hard work proves you know little of the current system.  More wealth is now inherited than earned in America today. A tax code skewed towards the rich and corporations allows them to take hundreds of millions in profits without paying anything while any middle class American has to pay. Even unprofitable industries like oil and gas and ethanol and coal are heavily subsidized by taxpayer dollars so even if a company operates at a loss, the shareholders still get profits. 
Tell me where in all this does effectiveness and hard work play a role?
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:17:44

There’s been a few threads on him especially when the trailer to the 60 min episode came out. The way I see it’s like talking shit to someone who sold their whatever baseball card decades ago for 5 bucks and now it’s somehow worth 500k. But going further this guy was the first person ever to sell baseball cards. That’s the equivalent of what people are making fun of him for - haha you did a thing no one else did before and only did it 5 bucks when if you did it today it would have been 500k.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:07:18
Yeah I got into bitcoin when it was around 1700 which I think was spring 2017 if I remember correctly. And just the way it rose so fast was shocking. Everyone was telling me to sell what I had but I just kept hodling. 
What circumstances or events do you think would make it go that high or higher again? I think at that time it was all tons of hype. But do you think it could be hyped up again?
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:43:59

@_date: 2019-05-23 01:54:13
I don’t think this is true at all lol. 
I think it’s incredibly rational to hold a declining asset in the hopes to buy more because you genuinely believe in the fundamentals of that asset to the point that even a 30 percent or 300 percent increase is just a blip compared to where you foresee it going (say 3000 percent). So you want that decline to come because you know the temporary increase is merely an inconvenience in your way to buying even more.
