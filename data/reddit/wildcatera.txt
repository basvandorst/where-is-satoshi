LOL well most bitcoiners had to scan and upload their passports/licenses/utility bills to go on trusted exchanges, so why can't people do this for a "vote coin"?  This upload process is potentially easier and less resource intensive than local registration processes.
@_date: 2013-06-11 06:16:47
With the internet we REALLY should have voting occur once a quarter.  And maybe people can vote on cool stuff, like pulling our 4 trillion dollars in troops out of 3rd world companies, re-opening 911 investigation to prosecute Americans involved, and little local stuff like your city installing sprinklers that run 12 hours a day in places no one gives a shit about, or immediately impeach people without spending billions on a media circus.

1. If everything was online, more people could run for office, more issues could be up for vote, etc.  
2. You said "I don't like the idea of political voting".  Well I hat to be the bearer of bad news, but in the US, in it's current state and "Democratic" origins, voting is here to stay, so we mind as well make it a stream lined, open source,  uncorrupted, publicly audible process, it open to everyone so they don't have to take off work and punch holes in paper in a senior center for an hour.

No worries...
I don't like labels like that because you pigeon hole yourself early on in a conversation. Anarchy has been turned in a pejorative term, and so has capitalism - it's very ambiguous.  You may be better off identifying as "not having a label" than anarcho-etc.

This sounds like someone from a record label in 1997 talking about the dangers of MP3... and talking like bitcoin is actually something that can be stopped.  It's not that "bitcoiners are in a state of denile" it's more like the current archaic and flawed system is in a state of denial, that they can actually control bitcoin.  PS: I've met over 1,000 "bitcoiners" and none of them talked about the black market aspects of bitcoin, they all cared about the currency performing as a day to day currency, nothing illicit. These "bitcoiners" were some of the smartest people I've ever met.
"Most Bitcoiners I have spoken to are not aware of their legal environment, or in a state of deep denial. It is not only about the federal and state legalities I mentioned above. They lack awareness of the direct culpability society attaches to the Bitcoin dealer, if it later turns out that his Bitcoin customer dealt in drugs, terror, human smuggling, copyright infringement, hacking, or any type of criminal activity. "

This is a mute point - with the NSA and everything else over the past 10 years they have all our data.  1 vote doesn't matter at this point. If 380,000,000 citizens give up their "anonymous" vote, is that any worse than the current situation we are in now: voting every four years for another silk suit wearing liars in office? Yes privacy is the key, but you can kiss all of it goodbye if we don't fix the voting system itself.

It doesn't need to be "impossible for a third party" currently their is nothing anonymous about voting.  You "register", you do it in public, and people could buy your votes now, and if they really wanted to audit your vote they could dig up the punch hole cards.

It could easily be immune to fraud.  
1. Create a finite amount of bitvote vote coin tokens. 350,000,000 Americans, and 189,000,000 have email addresses.
2. Hire white hat committee to inspect code.
3. Use volunteers, carefully background checked and briefed citizens to audit the votes.
4. Provide voting machines for the poor and elderly without internet access in grocery stores next to the lotto machines.
Use volunteers with ipads to go door-to-door as they would with the census.
5. Don't allow the presidential pageantry fiasco.  Aka men in make-up and suits "running" for president, spending billions on campaigning at decadent events, travel, and parties and use THIS money to reinforce our country's democratic voting system and use towards the countries best interest.
  
6. All the candidates get a one-page type website on the decentralized voting site, so it's an equal playing field for Joe the plumber to run and an ex-oil-conglomerate-blackwarter-invested  4,000,000 severance package wasp candidate to participate.

"Votecoin" or "truth coin"
Yeah I wish I could claim .0001% of this idea but I got it from 
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:19:41
1) Keep the ballot secret (from the government) but also ensure that people have received their ballots?
Maybe votes are shown publicly by "IP" and not people's names.  This would have to be further discussed. Protecting people's vote is important.
2) Prevent selling votes or the appearance of selling vote?
The vote can only go from Peer to candidate's ballet box/wallet.  it's not a fluid currency.  The "Votecoin" only represents a symbolic token for each citizen, but it truly audit-able and fair.
There are 349,000,000 people in the united states... people can not sell votes...  
It would be cheaper for a campaign office/agenda to use a groomed and prepped test tube baby president marionette that will seduce the nation to vote, than to actually buy individual votes... 
Technically: votes are somewhat "sold"... in that citizens have their class allegiances to parties, faces, ideas, and many people vote strictly on their their allegiance rather than what is ethical or best.
