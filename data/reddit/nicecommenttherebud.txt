Much more professional than coinbase. Also, standard purchase fees on limit orders are 0.25% versus 1.5% at coinbase.
This adds up on trades of 3+ coins at a time.

Bad advice. IRS released ruling in 2014 discussing their interpretation that Bitcoin is a capital asset. Ie. every transaction results in (buy/sell and gain/loss)

We live in a society based on the rule of law. If you choose to ignore the law based on personal beliefs, just be prepared for a run-in with the judicial system down the line.
You can try proving your case with facts, evidence, and legal precedent in the court of law should you be audited. Congress writes the laws and the IRS interprets them. This IS HOW the IRS currently interprets Bitcoin. FACT. 
There are many laws and rulings you and I may not agree with, but we must follow the law lest we face the legally prescribed repercussions. 
You do you big guy, but don't complain when big brother comes knocking.

Think of it like this:
I have $AAPL stock in my (Schwab) investment account, but I recently opened a (Robinhood) account and want to hold my stock in that account, while avoiding the need for a portfolio transfer.
I am selling my $AAPL stock from my (Schwab) account and buying $AAPL stock using my (Robinhood) account. I know this isn't the same because you are selling $AAPL stock on the open market verus internal transfer, but that's how it works and triggers a taxable event.
If you wanted to do the portfolio transfer, there is usually a cost of $75-$100 and the benefit here is that you get to keep your original cost basis in $AAPL, but have the fee for this privilege. 
I'm just trying to explain the applied logic of the IRS in this case. It sucks, but it's clear they don't view the transfer between different service wallets as a portfolio transfer but as taxable events whereby you do not have the privilege of retaining original basis.
[sidebar] I'm a tax accountant who has participated various Bitcoin tax seminars and have developed a comprehensive FIFO (First in First Out) macro excel spreadsheet in order to track all taxable events (transactions) for a business that operates 95% in bitcoin.

Thank you! I tried so many apps and this was flawed on the coinbase app. This one is a hidden gem!

It was a post way back in the day on a forum where the guy kept mispelling HOLD as HODL. A funny and very incoherent post that kind of caught on in this community and now if you're holding on for dear life, as in not selling, this is referred to as HODL. Wish I could link to the post, but have no idea where it is now. I was linked to it on this sub at some point.
